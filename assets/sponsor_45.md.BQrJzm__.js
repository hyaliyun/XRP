Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\\" third in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. This is one of only two Sherlock Holmes short stories where Holmes' client dies after seeking his help. The other is \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", part of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes's solution to the riddle of the dancing men rests on reasoning that closely resembles that of Legrand in Poe's \\"The Gold Bug.\\" The original title was \\"The Dancing Men,\\" when it was published as a short story in The Strand Magazine in December 1903. Plot The story begins when Hilton Cubitt of Ridling Thorpe Manor in Norfolk visits Sherlock Holmes and gives him a piece of paper with the following mysterious sequence of stick figures. A diagram drawn by Conan Doyle Cubitt explains to Holmes and Dr. Watson that he has recently married an American woman named Elsie Patrick. Before the wedding, she had asked her husband-to-be never to ask about her past, as she had had some \\"very disagreeable associations\\" in her life, although she said that there was nothing that she was personally ashamed of. Their marriage had been a happy one until the messages began to arrive, first mailed from the United States and then appearing in the garden. The messages had made Elsie very afraid but she did not explain the reasons for her fear, and Cubitt insisted on honoring his promise not to ask about Elsie's life in the United States. Holmes examines all of the occurrences of the dancing figures, and they provide him with an important clue - he realizes that it is a substitution cipher and cracks the code by frequency analysis. The last of the messages causes Holmes to fear that the Cubitts are in immediate danger. Holmes rushes to Ridling Thorpe Manor and finds Cubitt dead of a bullet to the heart and his wife gravely wounded from a gunshot to the head. Inspector Martin of the Norfolk Constabulary believes that it is a murder-suicide attempt; Elsie is the prime suspect. But Holmes, after noting some inconsistencies in that theory, proves that there is a third person involved. Holmes writes a message--in dancing figure characters--and has it delivered to a lodger at a nearby farm. While waiting for the result of this message, Holmes explains to Watson and Inspector Martin how he cracked the code of the dancing figures. The last message, which caused Holmes and Watson to rush to Norfolk, read \\"ELSIE PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD\\". Slaney is arrested. The lodger, Abe Slaney, another American, unaware that Elsie is gravely wounded, arrives at Ridling Thorpe Manor and is seized as he comes through the door. Holmes had sent for Slaney using the dancing men, knowing that Slaney would believe the message is from Elsie. Slaney reveals that he had been engaged to Elsie, the daughter of the Chicago crime boss whom Slaney works for, and that she had fled to escape her old life. Slaney had come to England to get her back. When Slaney and Elsie were speaking through a window, Cubitt had appeared and shots were exchanged; Cubitt was killed and Slaney had fled. Apparently, Elsie then shot herself. Slaney is arrested and sentenced to hang, but his sentence is reduced to penal servitude because Cubitt had fired the first shot. Elsie recovers from her injuries, and spends her life helping the poor and administering her late husband's estate. Publication history The story was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1903, and in the US in Collier's on 5 December 1903.Smith (2014), p. 119. It was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's.Cawthorne (2011), p. 115. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110.

Mongolian text in Chinese transcription, with a glossary on the right of each row The Secret History of the Mongols (Traditional Mongolian: 60px MongŒ≥ol-un niŒ≥uƒça tobƒçiyan, Khalkha Mongolian: –ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—ã–Ω –Ω—É—É—Ü —Ç–æ–≤—á–æ–æ, Mongolyn nuuts tovchoo) is the oldest surviving literary work in the Mongolian language. It was written for the Mongol royal family some time after the 1227 death of Genghis Khan (also known as Temujin). The author is anonymous and probably originally wrote in the Mongolian script, but the surviving texts all derive from transcriptions or translations into Chinese characters that date from the end of the 14th century and were compiled by the Ming dynasty under the title The Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty (). Also known as Tobchiyan ( or ) in the History of Yuan. The Secret History is regarded as the single most significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. Linguistically, it provides the richest source of pre-classical Mongolian and Middle Mongolian.Igor de Rachewiltz, The Secret History of the Mongols: A Mongolian Epic Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century (Brill: Leiden, The Netherlands) at xxvi. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.  Content  The work begins with a semi- mythical genealogy of Genghis Khan (also called Tem√ºjin). According to legend a blue-grey wolf and a fallow doe begat the first Mongol, named Batachiqan. Eleven generations after Batachiqan, a widow named Alan Qo‚Äôa was abandoned by her in-laws and left with her two boys B√ºg√ºn√ºtei and Belg√ºn√ºtei. She then bore three more sons with a supernatural glowing man who came in through the smoke- hole at the top of the tent. The youngest of Alan Qo‚Äôa‚Äôs three divinely-birth children was Bodonchar, founder of the Borjigin.. The description of Tem√ºjin's life begins with the kidnapping of his mother, Hoelun, by his father Yes√ºgei. It then covers Tem√ºjin's early life following his birth around 1160; the difficult times after the murder of his father; and the many conflicts against him, wars, and plots before he gains the title of Genghis Khan (Universal Ruler) in 1206. The latter parts of the work deal with the campaigns of conquest of Genghis and his third son √ñgedei throughout Eurasia; the text ends with √ñgedei's reflections on what he did well and what he did wrong. It relates how the Mongol Empire was created. It contains 12 or 13 chapters: # Tem√ºjin's origin and childhood. # Tem√ºjin's teenage years. # Temujin destroys the Merkit and takes the title Genghis Khan. # Genghis Khan struggles against Jamukha and Tayichiud. # Genghis Khan destroys the Tatars and tangles with Ong Khan # Destruction of the Khereid # The fate of Ong Khan # Escape of Kuchlug and a defeat of Jamukha. # Establishment of the empire and imperial guard. # Conquest of the Uyghur and forest peoples. # Conquest of the China, the Tanghut, the Persia, Baghdad and Russia # Tem√ºjin's death and √ñgedei's reign. # The death of Genghis Khan Several passages of the Secret History appear in slightly different versions in the 17th-century Mongolian chronicle Altan Tobchi (\\"Golden Summary\\"). Scholars of Mongolian history consider the text hugely important for the wealth of information it contains on the history, ethnography, language, literature and varied aspects of the Mongol culture. In terms of its value to the field of linguistic studies, it is considered unique among the Mongol texts as an example free from the influence of Buddhism prevalent in later texts. It is especially valued for its vivid and realistic depictions of daily tribal life and organization of Mongol civilization in the 12th and 13th centuries, complementing other primary sources available in the Persian and Chinese languages.Bela Kempf, Review (Acta Orientalia Vol. 59 No 4, 2006), p. 493.

Sumiyabaatar (mong.), \\"The Dictionary of the Mongolian Secret History: Mongolian-Chinese, Chinese-Mongolian dictionary, \\" A- B\\", 290 p., 2010, The only surviving copies of the work are transcriptions of the original Mongolian text with Chinese characters, accompanied by a (somewhat shorter) in-line glossary and a translation of each section into Chinese. In China, the work had been well known as a text for teaching Chinese to read and write Mongolian during the Ming dynasty, and the Chinese translation was used in several historical works, but by the 1800s, copies had become very rare. Baavuday Tsend Gun (1875‚Äì1932) was the first Mongolian scholar to transcribe The Secret History of the Mongols into modern Mongolian, in 1915‚Äì17. The first to discover the Secret History for the West and offer a translation from the Chinese glossary was the Russian sinologist Palladiy Kafarov in 1866. The first translations from the reconstructed Mongolian text were done by the German sinologist Erich Haenisch (edition of the reconstructed original text: 1937; of the translation: 1941, second edition 1948) and Paul Pelliot (ed. 1949). Tsendiin Damdins√ºren translated the chronicle into Khalkha Mongolian in 1947. B. I. Pankratov published a translation into Russian in 1962. Arthur Waley published a partial translation of the Secret History, but the first full translation into English was by Francis Woodman Cleaves, The Secret History of the Mongols: For the First Time Done into English out of the Original Tongue and Provided with an Exegetical Commentary.Harvard-Yenching Institute, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982. The archaic language adopted by Cleaves was not satisfying to all and, between 1972 and 1985, Igor de Rachewiltz published a fresh translation in eleven volumes of the series Papers on Far Eastern History accompanied by extensive footnotes commenting not only on the translation but also various aspects of Mongolian culture. (Brill Publishers released de Rachewiltz' edition as a two-volume set in 2003.) In 2015, de Rachewiltz published an open access version of his previous translation, The Secret History of the Mongols: A Mongolian Epic Chronicle of the Thirteenth Century, that is a full translation but omits the extensive footnotes of his previous translations. The Secret History of the Mongols has been published in translation in over 30 languages by researchers. In 2004 the Government of Mongolia decreed that the copy of The Secret History of the Mongols covered with golden plates was to be located to the rear part of the Government building.

Abstract. [ PDF. Firms exist as an alternative system to the market-price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non-market environment. For example, in a labor market, it might be very difficult or costly for firms or organizations to engage in production when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand/supply conditions. It might also be costly for employees to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives. Similarly, it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily. Thus, firms engage in a long-term contract with their employees or a long-term contract with suppliers to minimize the cost or maximize the value of property rights.Holmstr√∂m, Bengt, and John Roberts (1998). \\"The Boundaries of the Firm Revisited,\\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 12(4), pp. 73‚Äì94 (close Pages tab).Jean Tirole (1988).

Background The First World War period saw change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry-level analysis which mainly included analyzing markets to analysis at the level of the firm, as it became increasingly clear that perfect competition was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved. Economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist. Markets are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange. The need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by empirical studies by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, who made it clear that ownership of a typical American corporation is spread over a wide number of shareholders, leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little equity themselves. R. L. Hall and Charles J. Hitch found that executives made decisions by rule of thumb rather than in the marginalist way. Transaction cost theory The model shows institutions and market as a possible form of organization to coordinate economic transactions. When the external transaction costs are higher than the internal transaction costs, the company will grow. If the external transaction costs are lower than the internal transaction costs the company will be downsized by outsourcing, for example. According to Ronald Coase's essay The Nature of the Firm, people begin to organise their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange, given imperfect information, is greater than within the firm. Ronald Coase set out his transaction cost theory of the firm in 1937, making it one of the first (neo-classical) attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market. One aspect of its 'neoclassicism' lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with constant returns to scale, rather than relying on increasing returns to scale.Archibald, G.C. (1987 [2008]). \\"firm, theory of the,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 2, p. 357. Another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin, so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply. He notes that a firm's interactions with the market may not be under its control (for instance because of sales taxes), but its internal allocation of resources are: ‚ÄúWithin a firm, ‚Ä¶ market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur ‚Ä¶ who directs production.‚Äù He asks why alternative methods of production (such as the price mechanism and economic planning), could not either achieve all production, so that either firms use internal prices for all their production, or one big firm runs the entire economy. Coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production, and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm, with its \\"distinguishing mark ‚Ä¶ [of] the supersession of the price mechanism.\\" Coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise, and dismisses each as unimportant: # if some people prefer to work under direction and are prepared to pay for the privilege (but this is unlikely); # if some people prefer to direct others and are prepared to pay for this (but generally people are paid more to direct others); # if purchasers prefer goods produced by firms. Instead, for Coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism. These include discovering relevant prices (which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists), as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction (which can be large if there is uncertainty). Moreover, contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re-negotiated. The costs of haggling about division of surplus, particularly if there is asymmetric information and asset specificity, may be considerable. If a firm operated internally under the market system, many contracts would be required (for instance, even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation). In contrast, a real firm has very few (though much more complex) contracts, such as defining a manager's power of direction over employees, in exchange for which the employee is paid. These kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty, in particular for relationships which last long periods of time. Such a situation runs counter to neo-classical economic theory. The neo-classical market is instantaneous, forbidding the development of extended agent-principal (employee-manager) relationships, of planning, and of trust. Coase concludes that ‚Äúa firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short- term contract would be unsatisfactory‚Äù, and that ‚Äúit seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty‚Äù. He notes that government measures relating to the market (sales taxes, rationing, price controls) tend to increase the size of firms, since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs. Thus, Coase defines the firm as \\"the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur.\\" We can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions. The question then arises of what determines the size of the firm; why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does, why no more or less? Since the reason for the firm's being is to have lower costs than the market, the upper limit on the firm's size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market. (At the lower limit, the firm's costs exceed the market's costs, and it does not come into existence.) In practice, diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm, particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions (such as a conglomerate), or if the relevant prices change frequently. Coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism, and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs. These two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each.Ronald H. Coase (1988). \\"The Nature of the Firm: Influence\\", Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, 4(1), p p. 33-47. Reprinted in The Nature of the Firm: Origins, Evolution, and Development (1993), Oliver E. Williamson and S, G. Winter, ed., pp. 61‚Äì74. Reconsiderations of transaction cost theory According to Louis Putterman, most economists accept distinction between intra-firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other; the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock. George Barclay Richardson for example, notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter- firm co-operation. Klein (1983) asserts that ‚ÄúEconomists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market (contractual) relationships.‚Äù The costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the transaction costs. Ultimately, whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply ‚Äúa legal fiction‚Äù, ‚Äúa nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals‚Äù (as Jensen and Meckling put it) is ‚Äúa function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra-firm relationships‚Äù. Managerial and behavioural theories It was only in the 1960s that the neo-classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories. Managerial theories of the firm, as developed by William Baumol (1959 and 1962), Robin Marris (1964) and Oliver E. Williamson (1966), suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own utility and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit-maximising case. (Baumol suggested that managers‚Äô interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders.) More recently this has developed into ‚Äòprincipal‚Äìagent‚Äô analysis (e.g., Spence and Zeckhauser and Ross (1973) on problems of contracting with asymmetric information) which models a widely applicable case where a principal (a shareholder or firm for example) cannot costlessly infer how an agent (a manager or supplier, say) is behaving. This may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal, or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent's actions; it is asymmetric information which leads to a problem of moral hazard. This means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests. Traditional managerial models typically assume that managers, instead of maximising profit, maximise a simple objective utility function (this may include salary, perks, security, power, prestige) subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint (profit satisficing). Behavioural approach The behavioural approach, as developed in particular by Richard Cyert and James G. March of the Carnegie School places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm, and goes well beyond neoclassical economics. Much of this depended on Herbert A. Simon‚Äôs work in the 1950s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty, which argued that ‚Äúpeople possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only ‚Äòbounded rationality‚Äô when making decisions in complex, uncertain situations‚Äù. Thus individuals and groups tend to \\"satisfice\\"‚Äîthat is, to attempt to attain realistic goals, rather than maximize a utility or profit function. Cyert and March argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith, because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests, and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts. Organisational mechanisms (such as \\"satisficing\\" and sequential decision-taking) exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental. Compared to ideal state of productive efficiency, there is organisational slack (Leibenstein's X-inefficiency). Team production Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz's analysis of team production extends and clarifies earlier work by Coase. Thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production, but that the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems (it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co-operating inputs for reward purposes) and attendant shirking (the moral hazard problem) can be overcome, by estimating marginal productivity by observing or specifying input behaviour. Such monitoring as is therefore necessary, however, can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity's residual income (otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored, ad infinitum). For Alchian and Demsetz, the firm therefore is an entity which brings together a team which is more productive working together than at arm's length through the market, because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort. In effect, therefore, this is a \\"principal-agent\\" theory, since it is asymmetric information within the firm which Alchian and Demsetz emphasise must be overcome. In Barzel (1982)‚Äôs theory of the firm, drawing on Jensen and Meckling (1976), the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function (since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm). The weakness in Alchian and Demsetz‚Äôs argument, according to Williamson, is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of application, as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs. In practice this may have limited applicability (small work group activities, the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra), since most outputs within a firm (such as manufacturing and secretarial work) are separable, so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs. Hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms (in particular, large multi-plant and multi-product firms) exist. Asset specificity For Oliver E. Williamson, the existence of firms derives from ‚Äòasset specificity‚Äô in production, where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second-best use. This causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms (such as purchaser and supplier), because it will lead to protracted bargaining concerning the gains from trade, because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer competing with a (possibly large) number of agents in the entire market, and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly: large-numbers bargaining is transformed into small-number bargaining. If the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one, re-negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade, further increasing the transaction costs. Moreover, there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular, firm- specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both; but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re-negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment (this is the hold-up problem, which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them). In this kind of a situation, the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents (or coalitions of agents) may be the removal of one of them from the equation by takeover or merger. Asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital, so that the hold-up problem can also occur with labour (e.g. labour can threaten a strike, because of the lack of good alternative human capital; but equally the firm can threaten to fire). Probably the best constraint on such opportunism is reputation (rather than the law, because of the difficulty of negotiating, writing and enforcement of contracts). If a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent's dealings in the future, this alters the incentives to be opportunistic. Williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of delegation (as a firm's size increase its hierarchical bureaucracy does too), and the large firm's increasing inability to replicate the high- powered incentives of the residual income of an owner-entrepreneur. This is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual (increasing the incentives to shirk), and because intervention rights from the centre characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility, thereby diluting incentives. Milgrom and Roberts (1990) explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves, resulting in costs to managers of filtering information, and often the making of decisions without full information.{Feroz, E. H., Park, K. J. and Pastena, V., ‚ÄúThe Financial and Market Effects of the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases‚Äù. Journal of Accounting Research Vol. 29, pp. 107-142, Supplement 1991.} This grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy. Empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs.Barak D. Richman and Jeffrey Mache (2008). \\"Transaction Cost Economics: An Assessment of Empirical Research in the Social Sciences,\\" Business and Politics, 10(1), pp. 1-63. Abstract. PDF.Special Issue of Journal of Retailing in Honor of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009 to Oliver E. Williamson, 86(3), pp. 209-290, article-preview links (2010). Edited by Arne Nygaard and Robert Dahlstrom. Research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics. Firm economies The theory of the firm considers what bounds the size and output variety of firms. This includes how firms may be able to combine labour and capital so as to lower the average cost of output, either from increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale for one product line or from economies of scope for more than one product line.John C. Panzar and Robert D. Willig (1981). \\"Economies of Scope,\\" American Economic Review, 71(2), p p. 268‚Äì272.Jean Tirole (1988). The Theory of Industrial Organization. \\"The Theory of the Firm,\\" pp. 18‚Äì20. MIT Press. Other models Efficiency wage models like that of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring, since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk, given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired. Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975) suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale-damaging monitoring, where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance. (The difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a blue-collar environment, the latter to a white-collar one). Leibenstein (1966) sees a firm's norms or conventions, dependent on its history of management initiatives, labour relations and other factors, as determining the firm's \\"culture\\" of effort, thus affecting the firm's productivity and hence size. George Akerlof (1982) develops a gift exchange model of reciprocity, in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level, and workers have developed a concern for each other's welfare, such that all put in effort above the minimum required, but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity; again, size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors. In sum, the limit to the firm's size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm. Recently, Yochai Benkler further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of ‚Äúcommons-based peer production‚Äù systems such as open source software (e.g., Linux), Wikipedia, Creative Commons, etc. He put forth this argument in The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, which was released in 2006 under a Creative Commons share-alike license.  Grossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore theory  In modern contract theory, the ‚Äútheory of the firm‚Äù is often identified with the ‚Äúproperty rights approach‚Äù that was developed by Sanford J. Grossman, Oliver D. Hart, and John H. Moore. The property rights approach to the theory of the firm is also known as the ‚ÄúGrossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore theory‚Äù. In their seminal work, Grossman and Hart (1986), Hart and Moore (1990) and Hart (1995) developed the incomplete contracting paradigm. They argue that if contracts cannot specify what is to be done given every possible contingency, then property rights (and hence firm boundaries) matter. Specifically, consider a seller of an intermediate good and a buyer. Should the seller own the physical assets that are necessary to produce the good (non-integration) or should the buyer be the owner (integration)? After relationship-specific investments have been made, the seller and the buyer bargain. When they are symmetrically informed, they will always agree to collaborate. Yet, the division of the ex post surplus depends on the parties‚Äô disagreement payoffs (the payoffs they would get if no ex post agreement were reached), which in turn depend on the ownership structure. Thus, the ownership structure has an influence on the incentives to invest. A central insight of the theory is that the party with the more important investment decision should be the owner. Another prominent conclusion is that joint asset ownership is suboptimal if investments are in human capital. The Grossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore model has been successfully applied in many contexts, e.g. with regard to privatization. Chiu (1998) and DeMeza and Lockwood (1998) have extended the model by considering different bargaining games that the parties may play ex post (which can explain ownership by the less important investor). Oliver Williamson (2002) has criticized the Grossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore model because it is focused on ex ante investment incentives, while it neglects ex post inefficiencies. Schmitz (2006) has studied a variant of the Grossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore model in which a party may have or acquire private information about its disagreement payoff, which can explain ex post inefficiencies and ownership by the less important investor. Several variants of the Grossman‚ÄìHart‚ÄìMoore model such as the one with private information can also explain joint ownership.

She is a senior newsreader mainly presenting BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten. She can often be found presenting state occasions. In 2015, she became the new presenter of consumer affairs programme Watchdog and in 2016, began presenting Crimewatch, both for BBC One. Early life Born in Surrey to a florist mother and a businessman father, Raworth grew up in an exclusive area of Twickenham in West London and attended the independent Putney High and St Paul's Girls' schools. After completing a degree in French and German at the University of Manchester, Raworth spent a year teaching English to teenagers in Toulouse before studying for a postgraduate course in broadcasting and journalism at City University, London. Career Raworth joined the BBC in 1992 as a news reporter, first for Greater Manchester Radio and then, in April 1994, as BBC Regions correspondent in Brussels. In May 1995, she became the regular joint presenter of BBC's Look North programme in Leeds. Raworth moved to national television in 1997, to co-present the BBC's Breakfast News programme on BBC One, initially with Justin Webb, and in later years, with John Nicolson. Raworth then joined the BBC's early morning news programme Breakfast at its launch in 2000, which she presented alongside Jeremy Bowen and in later years, Dermot Murnaghan, on Monday‚ÄìThursdays, and sometimes with regular relief presenters such as Bill Turnbull and Michael Peschardt. She then moved to the BBC Six O'Clock News in January 2003 which she presented alongside George Alagiah; she was a presenter on this bulletin until October 2005 when she went on maternity leave, and was replaced by Natasha Kaplinsky. In March 2006 Raworth was named as the main presenter of the BBC News at One, replacing Anna Ford on Monday- Thursdays. She took up the position in June 2006 after returning from maternity leave. She also can occasionally be seen presenting relief shifts on the rolling news channel BBC News Channel. Raworth has presented several BBC specials, including coverage of the Queen's Golden Jubilee and Our Monarchy ‚Äì the Next 50 Years, both alongside David Dimbleby. In addition, she has appeared on Tomorrow's World and, in the early 2000s, entertainment programmes such as Dream Lives and the quiz show Judgemental. In 2004, Raworth appeared on the BBC fashion show What Not to Wear, in which she was given a makeover by style advisors Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine. In 2006 she was part of the television coverage of the Children's Party at the Palace, an event to celebrate the Queen's 80th birthday. Along with Huw Edwards, she presented some fake news updates for the programme, which led to many complaints from viewers.Complaints about BBC's fake news updates BBC Editor's Blog Raworth had a cameo role as a newsreader in the last series of the BBC comedy series My Hero. At the end of the One O'Clock News on 31 January 2008, she announced that she would be leaving the programme until the summer, and confirmed Kate Silverton as presenting the bulletin during her absence. Raworth returned on 25 August 2008, after the birth of her third child, with the presentation of the Bank Holiday edition of the BBC News at One, BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten. Raworth ran the Great North Run on 5 October 2008. Since early 2009, Raworth has been the main relief presenter on the BBC News at Six and a regular relief presenter on the BBC News at Ten, often presenting when regular presenters Huw Edwards, Fiona Bruce and George Alagiah are not available. She has also appeared in place of Andrew Marr on The Andrew Marr Show, and presented on the BBC News Channel (formerly known as BBC News 24). In May 2009, she presented The Trouble with Working Women with reporter and father- of-three Justin Rowlatt on the BBC. The programme looked at the role of the working woman.\\"The Trouble with Working Women\\". BBC Two. Retrieved 16 December 2013 In 2009, she presented Crimewatch Roadshow on BBC One on weekday mornings. In 2013, Raworth had a cameo appearance at the start of the film A Good Day to Die Hard as herself. On 16 July 2013, Raworth was given an Award of Doctor of Arts honoris causa by City University London. Raworth presented Watchdog Daily in 2012 and Watchdog Test House in 2014 and 2015, before landing the role of main presenter on Watchdog in September 2015. She replaced Anne Robinson. In February 2016, Raworth replaced Kirsty Young as main anchor of Crimewatch. She previously guest presented the programme in 2012. In 2017 it was reported that she earns ¬£150,000 - ¬£199,999 as a BBC presenter. In 2018, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force, Raworth presented a documentary called RAF 100: Into the Blue, where she talked about her grandfather, Cpt. Edwin Raworth, who was a pilot in the First World War. Personal life Raworth lives in London. In March 2017, the genealogy programme, Who Do You Think You Are? on BBC television, featured Raworth's family story. It revealed that she was descended from non-conformist ancestors who were members of the New Jerusalem Church. They lived in Birmingham at a time when the city was rocked by religious riots in 1791 with people like her ancestors being the targets. In the aftermath of the riots, Raworth's ancestors, William and Martha Mott, took a great risk by uprooting their young family to move to North America. However, within two years of arriving, the parents had died of yellow fever and the children were sent back to England. Raworth discovers in the programme that she was not descended from noted piano maker Henry Isaac Robert Mott as the family had believed, but from his cousin, Samuel Mott, who was sacked from the piano company and ended up taking his own life. Investigating another branch of her paternal family tree, she found a long line of horticultural heritage stretching back to the 1700s, and beginning with her great-grandfather Edgar Cussons Crowder, who once worked in the Palm House at Kew Gardens. Further research reveals that her five-times great-grandfather, Abraham Crowder, grew and sold pineapple plants in the 18th century, at a time when the fruit was a prestigious luxury. Running On 17 April 2011, Raworth completed the London Marathon, despite collapsing two miles from the finish line. By 2017, she had completed all six World Marathon Majors. In April 2018, Raworth completed the Marathon des Sables, a six-day, ultramarathon in the Sahara Desert.

Plot Holmes examines Violet Smith's fingers while Dr. Watson looks on. Holmes is contacted by Miss Violet Smith of Farnham, Surrey about an unusual turn in hers and her mother's lives. Violet's father has recently died and left his wife and daughter rather poor. There was an ad in the news asking about their whereabouts. Answering it, they met Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, the former a pleasant enough man, but the latter a bullying churl. They had come from South Africa, where they had known Violet's uncle Ralph Smith, who had now also died in poverty and apparently wanted to see that his relatives were provided for. This struck Violet as odd, since she and her family had not heard a word from Smith since his departure for South Africa 25 years ago. Carruthers and Woodley explained that before dying, Ralph had heard of his brother's death and felt responsible for his survivors' welfare. Carruthers began by offering Violet a job as a live-in music teacher for his ten-year-old daughter at ¬£100 a year, about twice the going rate. She accepted after Carruthers said that she could visit her mother on weekends. That went well until Mr. Woodley came to stay for a week. He made the most oafish and clumsy sexual advances to her, and boasted that if Violet married him she would have a life of luxury. He even grabbed her and demanded a kiss, precipitating expulsion by his host, Carruthers. Violet has not seen Woodley since. The specific thing that has brought Violet to seek Holmes's services, however, is the strange man who follows her on his bicycle as she cycles to and from the railway station for her weekend visits to her mother. The strange man always keeps his distance behind her and disappears without a trace, never letting her near him, and always along the same lonely stretch of road. Violet does not recognize him, but he has a black beard. Holmes asks her about her admirers, and other than Woodley, if he can be styled as such, she can only think of Mr. Carruthers, who, although a perfect gentleman at all times, seems attracted to her. After Violet leaves, Holmes observes that it is odd that a household would pay ¬£100 a year for a music teacher but be too cheap to pay for a horse and trap. He sends Dr. Watson to Surrey to see what he can find out. This turns out to be virtually nothing, except to establish that the lady's story is true, and that the mystery man comes out of and goes back into a local house, Charlington Hall. Holmes upbraids Watson for his lackluster results. They also receive a letter from Violet that evening saying that Carruthers has proposed to her, but she had to refuse since she is already engaged to a man named Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer in Coventry. Holmes goes to Surrey himself, and gets into a fight in a pub for his troubles; when he returns and tells Watson what happened, he actually considers his experience in Surrey to be hilarious. It seems that Mr. Woodley was in the taproom at the pub and heard his name mentioned in conversation. He came out and demanded to know who Holmes was and what he wanted. The discussion escalated to violence; Holmes emerged with a few bruises, whereas Woodley had to be carried home. The innkeeper merely mentioned that Woodley is a regular weekend guest at Charlington Hall, which is rented by Williamson, who, rumor has it, is a clergyman. Holmes returns to 221B Baker Street with his face somewhat marred, and another letter arrives from Violet, saying that her situation has become impossible owing to Mr. Carruthers's proposals, and Mr. Woodley's reappearance. She is quitting. Holmes knows that some intrigue is afoot, and he tells Watson that they must get themselves to Surrey to see that Violet makes it to the station. Carruthers has at last acquired a trap, and she need not ride her bicycle this time. Through a failure to realize that Violet might take an earlier train than usual, Holmes discovers that he is too late to meet Violet. The trap comes along the road, but by the time it does, no one is in it: Violet has been abducted. Holmes and Watson board the empty trap in an attempt to go after the kidnappers. They come face-to-face with the mysterious cyclist, who pulls a revolver on them; however, both parties quickly realise that they are on the same side ‚Äì both have Violet's welfare in mind. The cyclist declares that the abductors are Woodley and Williamson. He evidently knows something of the intrigue. Carruthers and Holmes stopping the wedding. The group first find an unconscious groom, who was driving the trap, in the bushes, and then they find all three persons that they have been seeking on the Charlington Hall grounds, with the apparently defrocked clergyman performing a wedding ceremony between the other two. The bride is somewhat unwilling, judging from the gag over her mouth. Woodley's boast of having married Violet leads the mysterious cyclist, unmasking himself as Carruthers, to pull out his revolver and shoot Woodley, wounding him. The intrigue does indeed involve Uncle Ralph in South Africa. He was dying when Carruthers and Woodley left; far from being penniless at his death, it is revealed that in reality, Uncle Ralph had amassed a large fortune. As he was illiterate, he would surely die intestate, and therefore Violet would inherit his wealth as Ralph's next of kin. The two crooks made their way to England in the hopes that one of them would get to marry Violet ‚Äì Woodley having won the chance in a card game on the ship ‚Äì and they had to draw Williamson into the plot, promising him a share of the lucre. The plan went awry when first, Woodley proved to be a brute, and next, Carruthers fell in love with Violet, and thereafter wanted nothing to do with his former confederates. He took to disguising himself and following her as she rode her bicycle past Charlington Hall, where he knew Woodley and Williamson might be lying in wait for her. Heavy penalties await Woodley and Williamson, but Carruthers only gets a few months due to Woodley's less-than-savory reputation. Holmes reassures Carruthers the \\"marriage\\" performed by Williamson was void; not only was it performed against Violet's will, but Williamson had been defrocked and therefore had no authority to legalise a marriage. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\\" was first published in the US in Collier's on 26 December 1903. In the UK, it was published in The Strand Magazine in January 1904.Smith (2014), p. 120. The story was published with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 117. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110. The first version of the story was refused by the editor of The Strand Magazine because Holmes was not very involved in the plot. Conan Doyle was not very pleased with the story and believed that the first three stories of The Return of Sherlock Holmes (\\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", \\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\\", and \\"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\\") were better than this story. Adaptations=Film and television The story was adapted as a 1921 short silent film in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes. The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett was relatively faithful to the original story; however, it has a comic relief ending when Holmes's chemical experiment causes the flat to fill up with smoke, and brings the fire brigade to the scene. (The chemical experiment ‚Äì without smoke ‚Äì is from \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\".)

With over 100,000 members as of 2016, it is the second-largest legal political group in Syria after the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party,http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5425 The SSNP is now Syria's largest party after the ruling Ba'ath. In Lebanon, it has been a major secular and highly organised elite party in the political history of the country for over 80 years. Until recent times it was a key group in the March 8 Alliance. Founded in Beirut in 1932 as an anticolonial and national liberation organization hostile to French colonialism, the party played a significant role in Lebanese politics and was involved in attempted coups d'√©tat in 1949 and 1961, following which it was thoroughly repressed. It was active in resistance against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon until 2000, while continuously supporting the Syrian presence in Lebanon out of belief in Syrian irredentism but also due to the decades-long repression the party endured at the hands of the Baath Party in Syria. In Syria, the SSNP had become a major right-wing political force in the early 1950s, but was thoroughly repressed in 1955‚Äì56. It remained organized, and by the late 1990s had allied itself with the PLO and the Lebanese Communist Party, despite the ideological rivalry that persists among them. The SSNP was legalized in Syria in 2005, and joined the Ba'ath Party-led National Progressive Front. From 2012 to 6 May 2014, the party was part of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation. During the course of the Syrian Civil War the party has seen its relevance increasing in Syria, where almost 12,000 fighters of the party's armed branch, the Eagles of the Whirlwind, fight alongside the Syrian Armed Forces against the Syrian opposition and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Background Referring to Syria, Butrus al-Bustani adopted \\"Love of the Homeland is an article of Faith\\" as a slogan when he founded the periodical Al-Jinan in 1870 Early Syrian nationalists In the mid-nineteenth century Butrus al-Bustani was one of the first to assert the existence of a natural Syrian nation that should be accommodated in a reformed Ottoman Empire.Albert Hourani, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983) 100‚Äì102 He belonged to the Nahda, thinkers influenced by the Arabic Literary Renaissance and the French RevolutionElizabeth Suzanne Kassab, Contemporary Arab Thought, Cultural Critique in Comparative Perspective (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 20‚Äì21 and who wished to shape the Tanzimat reforms, which were an attempt to introduce a constitutional monarchy with religious freedom to reverse the Ottoman state's creeping economic marginalisationPaul Salem, Bitter Legacy: Ideology and Politics in the Arab World (Syracuse University Press, 1994) and which would lead to the Young Turks and the Second Constitutional Era. An influential follower of al-Bustani was the Belgian Jesuit historian, Henri Lammens, ordained as a priest in Beirut in 1893, who claimed that Greater Syria had since ancient times encompassed all the land between the Arab peninsula, Egypt, the Levantine corridor and the Taurus Mountains, including all the peoples within the Fertile Crescent.Asher Kaufman, \\"Henri Lammens and Syrian Nationalism,\\" in Adel Beshara, The Origins of Syrian Nationhood: Histories, Pioneers and Identity. \\"Syria is the Tunic of Christ\\" ‚Äì Henri Lammens. This was also accompanied with the rise of a profoundly idealistic patriotism, largely resembling European romantic nationalism, idealizing the coming of a National Revival to the Levant, that would shake off the Ottoman past and propel back what many started to see again as the cradle of civilization into the modern world's front stage. In that aspect, the works of Khalil Gibran who began expressing his belief in Syrian nationalism and patriotism are central. As Gibran said, \\"I believe in you, and I believe in your destiny. I believe that you are contributors to this new civilization. [...] I believe that it is in you to be good citizens. And what is it to be a good citizen? [...] It is to stand before the towers of New York and Washington, Chicago and San Francisco saying in your hearts, \\"I am the descendent of a people the builded Damascus and Byblos, and Tyre and Sidon and Antioch, and I am here to build with you, and with a will.\\"Khalil Gibran, \\"To Young Americans of Syrian Origin\\". URL: http://www.alhewar.com/gibran_to_young_americans.htm Colonialism, Zionism and sectarianism The late 1920s and the early 1930s were also a period of cultural and political effervescence that greatly contributed to the emergence of Syrian nationalism as a distinct ideology. In 1920, the French army toppled the first Arab Kingdom of Syria and the Hashemite King Faisal, who had been proclaimed \\"King of all-Syria\\" by the Syrian National Congress at the Battle of Maysalun. The British and the French dissected the region into spheres of influence in what later became known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement, setting up colonial administrations throughout the Levant. \\"On the ashes of our past, we will build our coming glory\\". Free Syria according to Khalil Gebran The Great Syrian Revolt was brutally repressed in 1925 while a small clique of traditional landowners and notables coalesced around the newly founded administration of the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Greater Lebanon was established on the ruins of the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon with arbitrarily drawn borders and with a state structure largely dominated by the Christian Maronites, a community whose elite were historically well- disposed to the French, and who would ensure the French colonial empire a strong foothold in the Arab world. Jewish immigration to Palestine was increasing at an alarming speed, bringing to the shores of Palestine Zionist migrants who had little affinity to (Revisionist Zionism) or similarities with (Marxist and Labor Zionism) the local populace, be it the Palestinian Arabs or the traditional local Jewish communities. Class tensions sharpened as some Palestinian landowners sold their lands to the Jewish National Fund, with little regard to the national aspirations and plight of the peasantry. As the Balfour Declaration became public, fears in the Levant of the parceling out of the region along Colonial borders implied in the minds of many the need for concerted action throughout the Levant that would transcend traditional sectarian divides. Similarly, Communism, perceived by many as an alien ideology that did not resonate much with the socioeconomic conditions of the early 20th century Levant, was looked upon with suspicion, particularly since many Zionist migrants settling in Palestine were coming from the Soviet Union. Many Syrian and Lebanese youth saw these events as omens of an ill future in which the Levant, which had until then been a single economic and social entity within the Ottoman Empire referred to as Bilad al-Sham, would be dismembered along religious, ethnic, and class lines. As the traditional elite stirred away from the people and slowly sought the good offices of the French High Commissioner, and given the repression with which the French Mandate was applied, Secret societies flourished in the late 1920s. Similarly, many begin to see the devastating effect that sectarianism was bringing upon the people of the region, be it pro-Christian Separatism in Lebanon or the radicalism of Islamist elements in Syria, which pitted each faction against the other and benefited no other than the colonial administration, and began to condemn the mixing of religion with politics. The path was hence laid down for the emergence of a political ideology that would simultaneously fight against the dismemberment of the region, Zionism, and Colonialism, through Anti- colonialism, Liberation War, and National Revival, while keeping communism in check. It also represented a clear departure from the Arab nationalist current that advocated the unification of the entirety of the Arab World, and which had implicit Islamic nationalist undertones. This ideology was to be that of a Romanticized Secular Greater Syria based upon the natural geographical boundaries that defined the region loosely dubbed as the Fertile Crescent, an ideology that Antun Saadeh would come to assert with the foundation of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, where it found its full expression. Foundation and early years Antun Saadeh The SSNP was founded by Antun Saadeh, a Lebanese journalist and lecturer from a Greek Orthodox family who had lived in South America from 1919 to 1930 who in November 1932 secretly established the first nucleus of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, which operated underground for the first three years of its existence, and in 1933 started publishing the monthly journal Al-Majalla which was distributed in the American University of Beirut and developed the party's ideology. In 1936 the party's open hostility to colonialism led to the French authorities banning the party and the imprisoning Saadeh for six months for creating a clandestine party, although an accusation of having been in contact with the German and Italian fascist movements was dropped after the Germans denied any relationship. During his time in prison Saadeh wrote The Genesis of Nations to lay out the SSNP's ideology. At that time, the Party joined ranks with other nationalist and patriotic forces including the National Bloc, whereas it began militating, in secret, for the overthrow of the Mandate. Nonetheless, the alliance between the SSNP and the National Bloc did not last long: The National Bloc refrained from engaging in actual militant activities against the French, deciding instead to cooperate with the High Commissioner. Many SSNP members also felt that the NB refused to cooperate with them due to the fact that their founder was Christian.See: Youssef al-Debs, \\"In the Convoy of the Renaissance\\" Saadeh emigrated again to Brazil in 1938 and afterwards to Argentina, only to return to Lebanon in 1947 following the country's independence from the French in 1943. On his way to Argentina, he visited Italy and Berlin, which increased the suspicions of the French that the SSNP might have been entertaining relations with the Axis. Coming back shortly to Lebanon in 1939, he was questioned by the French authorities who accused him of plotting with the Germans. The charge was dropped when no evidence of collaboration had been found and after that Saadeh declared that even the French rule to which he was vehemently opposed would be better than German or Italian rule. Having afterwards left for Argentina, Saadeh found out that the Argentinian branch of the SSNP newspaper had been voicing its outright support for Nazi Germany and to the Axis powers, which led Saadeh to issue a lengthy letter to the editor-in-chef, restating that the SSNP is not a National Socialist party and that no stance should be taken vis-√†-vis the Allies or the Axis.Nordbrush, Nazism in Syria and Lebanon, 85‚Äì87 By that time, the SSNP had grown exponentially and had clashed on many occasions with its primary ideological rival, the Kataeb Party, a Spanish Fascist-Inspired party that had been founded by Pierre Gemayel, a pharmacist and athlete after his return from the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Being vehemently anti-communist in its early days, a position that would later change, it had also clashed with the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, the latter accusing the SSNP of Nazi sympathies. Antoun Saadeh's map of a \\"Natural Syria\\", based on the etymological connection between the name \\"Syria\\" and \\"Assyria\\". While the Kataeb was committed to the notion of Lebanon as a nation state defined as an entity presiding over the borders outlined first by the Sykes‚ÄìPicot agreement in 1916, and afterwards by the French administrative division of its mandate into six states including the state of Greater Lebanon, and had espoused a strong bond between the nation and the church as well as outright social ultraconservatism, the SSNP rejected these national claim on the basis that the borders outlining the newly created states were fictitious, resulting from colonialism, and do not reflect any historical and social realities. The party claimed that Greater Syria as defined by Saadeh represents the national ideal encompassing the historical people of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, bound together by a clearly defined geography and a common historical, social and cultural development path away from all sectarianism.A. Saadeh. The Genesis of Nations. Translated and Reprinted. Dar Al-Fikr. Beirut, 2004 The Party took a radical stance against the traditional notable class in Syria and Lebanon, including the large landowners and feudal lords, and called for the emancipation of the working class and the peasantry away from religion and sectarianism, into a socialist-inspired production-based economy. The SSNP also called for the reclamation of Alexandretta which had been arbitrarily given to Turkey by France. With the start of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict in 1948, Saadeh radicalized the party's Anti-Zionist stance by declaring that \\"Our struggle with the enemy is not a struggle for borders but for existence\\", and called on Party members to fight in the Arab Liberation Army, although many regular Lebanese and Syrian army officers were already Party members. Antun Saadeh faces his hasty and theatrical trial for \\"high treason and armed rebellion\\". He was summarily executed shortly afterwards When the Lebanese Communist Party, which had fought against Saadeh's return in 1947 and which had been fighting for the title of head of the country's Anti-Zionist movement, declared its acceptance of the Partition Plan, infuriated and increasingly zealous SSNP members burned down a Communist headquarters. As communists defected away after the Communist Party's sudden pivot upon orders from the Soviet Union, the SSNP's ranks swelled. When the Arabs lost the war in 1948, Saadeh propelled the Party into a fully confrontational stance: He deemed Arabism as a purely rhetorical gimmick, condemned the incompetence and hypocrisy of the Arab leaders, and asserted that the creation of the State of Israel and the expulsion of the Palestinians was the direct result of this incompetence.See: \\"The Rise of the Revolutionaries\\" in Patrick Seale, The Struggle for Arab Independence On July 4, 1949, a year after the declaration of the establishment of the state of Israel and the 1948 Palestinian exodus (the Nakba), and a response to a series of aggressions perpetrated by the Kataeb-backed Lebanese government, the SSNP attempted its first revolution. Following a violent crackdown by government forces, Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za'im in an attempt to obtain his support. A decision was taken by King Farouk, Riad el Solh and Husni al-Za'im to eliminate Antoun Saadeh, under the patronage of British Intelligence and the Mossad.http://daharchives.alhayat.com/issue_archive/Hayat%20INT/2000/7/7/ŸÖŸÜ- ŸÇÿ™ŸÑ-ÿ£ŸÜÿ∑ŸàŸÜ-ÿ≥ÿπÿßÿØŸá-Ÿàÿ´ÿßÿ¶ŸÇ-ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ©-ÿ™ŸÉÿ¥ŸÅ-ÿÆŸÑŸÅŸäÿßÿ™-ÿßŸÜŸÇŸÑÿßÿ®-ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜŸä-ÿßŸÑÿ≤ÿπŸäŸÖ.html. As a result, Al-Za'im handed Saadeh over to Lebanese authorities, who had him executed on July 8, 1949. It was the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender.Adel beshara (2010). Outright Assassination: The Trial and Execution of Antun Sa'adeh, 1949. Ithaca Press. . SSNP in Lebanon Flags of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Beirut on May 9 during the 2008 conflict in Lebanon  From confrontation to accommodation  After Saadeh was executed and its high-ranking leaders were arrested, the party remained underground until 1958 when it sided with the pro-Western president Camille Chamoun against the Arab nationalist rebels. accessed 19 January 2006. This occurred right after the Party was accused of having plotted the assassination of Adnan al-Malki, a left-leaning Baath Party army officer in Syria, and after Party members had fled to Beirut. The Party at that time still viewed the Soviet Union with contempt, and opposed the Arab Nationalist current of Nasser, while retaining its commitment to Syrian Nationalism. Indeed, the idea of having Greater Syria subsumed under the creed of Arab Nationalism founded on the Arabic language, Arab and Islamic culture was abhorred by the SSNP, which retained its profound belief in Syrian social and anthropological historicism, namely the process of national and social association that characterizes the Fertile Crescent and that differentiates it from the Arabian Peninsula or North Africa.  1961 coup d'etat  In 1961 two SSNP members, company commanders in the Lebanese army, tried to carry out a lightning coup against Fouad Chehab and failed. Among the main reasons cited by the perpetrators was the increasingly dictatorial aspects of the rule of General Chehab, his expansion of the state surveillance and intelligence apparatus, but also his Nasserist orientation. This resulted in a renewed proscription and the imprisonment of many of its leaders.U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States Volume 17, Near East,1961‚Äì1963, (Washington, DC: GPO 1993), 383-384. Most of the party's known activists remained in prison or exile until a general amnesty in 1969.  Lebanese Civil War  With the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the SSNP formed a military squad that allied with the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), against the Phalangists and their allies of the Lebanese Front. The SSNP saw the Lebanese Civil War as the inevitable result of the divisions of the Syrian nation into small states and away from a liberation war against Israel. After the defeat of anti- Israeli forces in the 1982 Lebanon War, the SSNP joined a number of the organizations who regrouped to resist the Israeli occupation, including the killing of two Israeli soldiers in a Wimpy Cafe in west Beirut by party member Khalid Alwan. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation blames the SSNP for the assassination, in 1982, of Bachir Gemayel, Lebanon's newly elected president supported by the Israelis besieging Beirut. In 1983 the party joined the Lebanese National Salvation Front. In 1985, a member of the party, Sana'a Mehaidli, detonated a car bomb next to an Israeli military convoy at Jezzin, South Lebanon. She killed two Israeli soldiers and become one of the first known female suicide bombers. The SSNP participated in a number of general elections in Lebanon, winning six seats in 1992, although seeing a decline in subsequent elections winning two seats in both 2005 and 2009. The SSNP were involved in the 2008 conflict in Lebanon, with gunmen attacking an SSNP office. SSNP in Syria In Syria, the SSNP grew to a position of considerable influence in the years following the country's independence in 1946, and was a major political force immediately after the restoration of democracy in 1954. It was a fierce rival of the Syrian Communist Party and of the pan-Arab Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, the other main ideological parties of the period. In April 1955 Colonel Adnan al-Malki, a Ba'athist officer who was a very popular figure in the Syrian army, was assassinated by a party member. This provided the Communists and Ba'athists with the opportunity to eliminate their main ideological rival, and under pressure from them and their allies in the security forces the SSNP was practically wiped out as a political force in Syria. The SSNP's stance during the Lebanese civil war and in Lebanese politics‚Äîwhere it has become a close ally of Hezbollah‚Äîwas consistent with that of Syria, and that facilitated a rapprochement between the party and the Syrian government. During Hafez al-Assad's presidency, the party was increasingly tolerated. After the succession of his son Bashar in 2000, this process continued. In 2001, although still officially banned, the party was permitted to attend meetings of the Ba'ath-led National Progressive Front coalition of legal parties as an observer. In Spring 2005 the party was legalised in Syria, in what has been described as \\"an attempt to allow a limited form of political activity\\". Over time, the SSNP and the Syrian Baathist regime experienced a dramatic turnabout in their historical relationship, from enemies to allies. The process started as the party reckoned that Hafez al-Assad regional goals such as consolidating Syria's control over Lebanon and the PLO were consistent with the SSNP's goal of establishing Greater Syria, while the SSNP reciprocated acting as a Syrian proxy in Lebanon. The alliance has strengthened on the face of the Syrian Civil War. In the 22 April 2007 election for the People's Council of Syria, the party gained 3 out of 250 in the parliament. Notable SSNP politicians in Syria include Issam Al Mahayri, Joseph Sweid, Bushra Massouh, and Issam Bagdi Role in the Syrian Civil War During the civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War the SSNP participated in counter demonstrations in support of the government. Once the war broke out, the Syrian government reciprocated providing weaponry and training. In the meantime, SSNP officials had become a target for rebel militants and were kidnapped and assassinated. Bashar al- Yazigi, head of the political SSNP bureau in Syria stated that the \\"opposition is seeking to create sharp sectarian rifts and fragment Syrian society\\" with the party regarding both the ongoing Syrian Civil War and the Iraq War as attempts to partition those countries‚Äîand, eventually Lebanon‚Äîalong ethno- sectarian lines. Estimates of the number of SSNP fighters in Syria range from 6,000 to 8,000. Lebanese fighters are included in their ranks, even though the party claims that \\"their proportion within the group's total fighting force has decreased steadily, as more Syrians sign up\\". By February 2014, SSNP fighters were primarily deployed in the governorates of Homs and Damascus and were said to be the most formidable military force other than the Syrian Army in Suweida. SSNP fighters have participated in the battles of Sadad, Ma'loula or al-Qaryatayn, among others. Party officials say its membership has increased \\"by the thousands\\" since the start of the war as a result of its alleged \\"reputation as an effective fighting force in Syria\\". The party is taking on a larger role in Syria's official political system: it fielded 30 candidates for the 2016 parliamentary election, winning 7 seats. SSNP in Jordan In 1966 King Hussein had his security services sent into action to eradicate the SSNP from Jordan. The party had been active among the Palestinian population. In 2013 followers of the party established the \\"Movement of Syrian Social Nationalists in Jordan\\".Ammon News. ÿßÿ∑ŸÑÿßŸÇ ÿ™Ÿäÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàŸÖŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¨ÿ™ŸÖÿßÿπŸäŸäŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿØŸÜAl-Hadath News. ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ŸäŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàŸÖŸäŸàŸÜ ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿßÿ±ÿØŸÜ Ÿäÿ≠ÿ™ŸÅŸÑŸàŸÜ ÿ®ÿ∞ŸÉÿ±Ÿâ ŸÖŸäŸÑÿßÿØ ÿßŸÜÿ∑ŸàŸÜ ÿ≥ÿπÿßÿØÿ© Ideology=Political tenets Greater Syria, natural Syria = While in jail from early February to early May 1936, Saadeh completed The Genesis of Nations which he had started writing three months before the French authorities in Lebanon discovered the secret organization and arrested its leader and his assistants. In his book, Saadeh formulated his belief in the existence of a Syrian nation in a homeland defined as embracing all historic Syria extended to the Suez Canal in the south, and that includes modern Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait. The boundaries of the historic environment in which the Syrian nation evolved went much beyond the scope usually ascribed to Syria, extending from the Taurus range in the north-east and the Zagros mountains in the north-west to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian desert and the Persian Gulf in the east. According to Saadeh, this region is also called the Syrian Fertile Crescent, the island Cyprus being its star. Greater Syria corresponds to the Mesopotamian basin of Bilad al-Sham before it was arbitrarily dissected by the colonial powers. According to Saadeh, geographical factors play an important role in setting the parameters for the process of association and thus for the establishment of a nation. He held that the process of human evolution from hunter-gatherer to settled agriculture was among the most important factors that led to the creation of private property and the class system. Saadeh highlighted the role that the class system played in the flourishing of trade and commerce and the creation of wealth, ascribing it to be a characteristic of the Semitic peoples, namely the coastal Phoenicians. He also stressed the link between the economic modes of production and the establishment of cultural norms and values, a view he shared with Karl Marx. However, Saadeh believed that while the economic modes of production can create culture, culture acquires a life of its own with time and eventually becomes embedded and perpetuated in its people, who come to recognize themselves as a living organism. Hence comes the importance of the state in serving the interest of the nation, and of national democracy as the legitimate source of political legislation. The party espouses the idea that the fundamental basis of nation is the territory or geographical region, not the ethnical bond. The natural environment and geographical specifications of a certain land is what eventually allows, or disallows, its transition from a socio-economic phase to another. SSNP members at Saadeh's return from exile in 1947 These natural geographical factors hence create the societal framework in which man establishes his existence, beliefs, habits, and value systems. Saadeh's critique of ethnic nationalisms led him to hence develop a framework of geographical nationalism, the idea of the \\"natural homeland\\". When he applied this model to the case of the Fertile Crescent, the conclusion he reached was straightforward: the natural geographical factors of the basin lying east of the Mediterranean is what has allowed it to become the cradle of civilizations, what has driven throughout the course of human history movements seeking to unify it, what has allowed it to establish, through ethnic, religious and cultural assimilation and mixing, a high culture and civilization, and what has made it the prize coveted by all imperialist powers. Saadeh advocated for all ethnoreligious groups to consider themselves as descendants of the pre-Christian era empires of Babylon and Assyria, of the Hittites and the kings of Aram, then of the Islamic empires, all the way up until the present. The SSNP claimed that the Greater Syria is the natural home of the Syrian people with clearly defined geographic boundaries, yet that its people are suffering from an identity crisis due to Ottoman occupation, colonialism, and sectarianism. Saadeh claimed that the renaissance of the Syrian nation is inevitably linked to the purge of these \\"decadent\\" forces through the reinforcing of national solidarity, resistance against colonialism, and adoption of secularism. In Saadeh's vision of \\"harmony\\" among the country's ethnic and religious communities through a return to a so-called Syrian \\"racial unity\\" which was itself in fact a mixture of races, neither Islam nor pan-Arabism was important, and therefore religion wasn't either. Saadeh's concept of the nation was shaped mainly by historical concrete interactions amongst people over the centuries in a given geography, rather than being based on ethnic origins, race, language or religion. This led him also to conclude that the Arabs could not form one nation, but many nations could be called Arab. = Syrian people = The SSNP's Greater Syria ideal posed a problem for all of the existing nationalist movements because of its clear departure from Arab nationalist and Islamic undertones, and its inextricable link with what the party leader defined as \\"the Syrian people\\", Greater Syria being its natural homeland. The notion of a Syrian people is the cornerstone of the SSNP, and is defined according to the Party as the people inhabiting the Fertile Crescent, whose culture and socio-economic conditions have been a direct consequence of its own interaction with the natural environment. The Syrian people, according to the Party's founder, is a cultural and socio-economic body of people hailing from a very heterogeneous background, but whose social mixing and assimilation over time within the Levantine basin has allowed for the emergence of a high settled civilization and for the extension of this people over the entirety of Natural Syria. In a clear departure from ethnic, racial and religious understandings of a nation, the Syrian people is a \\"mixture of races generated by migrations and intermarriages\\", its social life and cohesion having been shaped and determined by the environment and geography in which it developed. Hence the SSNP rejects racial notions of nationalism, Saadeh himself having ridiculed European racial doctrines in the opening chapters of the Genesis of Nations. = Romantic nationalism = The attitude of the party and its founder towards minority separatism and movements calling for ethnically-separate homelands was one of outright hostility. Saadeh was also hostile to all religiously-motivated political movements, or movements that did not call for the separation between Church (or Mosque) and State. Thus he called Wahhabism and Islamism a \\"return to the desert\\", a \\"dry ideology of Arabian tribes\\" that had no commonalities with the high civilization of the Fertile Crescent. The incoming Jewish migrants to Southern Syria (Palestine) and the Jewish communities were criticized for their \\"foreign and racial loyalties\\", their unwillingness to assimilate, and their active willingness to create an ethnically Jewish state in Palestine, with Saadeh deeming the Jews as the community unable and unwilling to assimilate, and having criticized the notion that Jewishness can be a cornerstone for a nation-state. For the SSNP, the Jews do not constitute a nation as they are a heterogeneous mixture of peoples in a similar sense that Muslims and Christians do not constitute a nation.See: Adel Beshara, \\"Where we Stand\\", http://www.ssnp.com/old/ourstand.htm Similarly, the Kurds were attacked for their communitarianism and their disposition to establish a Kurdish state in the north. In what relates to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the party has since its establishment adopted a hard- lined anti-Zionist stance, while retaining its belief that a secular and democratic state in Palestine is the only proper solution to the conflict. The societal cohesion of the Syrian people and its ability to properly assimilate newcomers, minorities, and migrations, is essential to its survival to its progress, and any movement that seeks to assert ethnic, religious, or racial separatism within the Syrian homeland is one that ought to be met with outright hostility. The answer to these threats, according to the Party, lay in the rebirth of the Syrian people, the Renaissance. = The Renaissance = The Syrian people, as outlined above, is, according to Saadeh, among the first people to have historically moved from the tribal phase into the settled agricultural phase and towards the establishment of private property and social classes. This first transition allowed the Syrian people to prosper exponentially and to excel in most of the crafts of the ancient world. Saadeh and the party espoused the belief that a new transition has to take place, a transition to the modern age, which ought to have two prerequisites: the secular unity of the Syrian people and its renaissance. The unity of the Syrian people firstly implies debarring the clergy from interfering in state affairs, and enacting a full separation between Church-Mosque and State. This would inevitably allow the Syrian people to regain its unity and social cohesion. The second task of the party is to work towards the Renaissance, which the party leader described as being a dynamic undertaking that would shatter what he described as the old regime. The Renaissance ideal, which Saadeh traces back to the ingenuity of the first Syrians ‚Äì the Assyrians and the Phoenicians, among others, lies in the mastery of the Syrian people over the sciences and the crafts, which he eulogizes in The Genesis of Nations while attacking what he deemed as the antiquated notions of religious fatalism. In order to regain its mastery over the crafts and over its own destiny, Saadeh underlines the need for intellectualism, education, and the pursuit of knowledge as cornerstones of the future Syrian society, a notion he summarizes in his famous quote, \\"Society is knowledge, and knowledge is power\\". = Social nationalism = While the Renaissance is underlined as a romanticized notion of spiritual, intellectual, and patriotic elevation, the SSNP elaborated a simple yet straightforward doctrine pertaining to how the Syrian People ought to organize itself once the Renaissance has begun, albeit the fact that Saadeh had not developed the idea completely. The social- nationalist model elaborated by Saadeh is reflected in the \\"Communiqu√© of the First Social Nationalist Revolution of 1949\\". The first of these principles is the abolition of feudalism and of the rule of the traditional notables and landowners, which the Party deems responsible for the \\"desolate state of things to which the country had gotten to\\", including maintaining educational levels at an all-time low and being instrumental in the loss of Palestine. The second principle is \\"opposing capitalist tyranny\\". Despite its belief in the necessity of private property, the SSNP declared defending workers' rights and establishing a framework that guarantees these rights as an inalienable right. This is coupled with the need to establish mandatory education, universal healthcare, the nationalization of vital areas of the economy such as the production of raw materials, and a strong centralized state that is able to give economic directions. The third principle stated is combating communism. This remains a topic of debate, however, as the strongly pronounced nationalistic features of SSNP ideology would permit scholars to interpret social nationalism. = Liberation war = Perhaps one of the most striking feature of the Party throughout its history, and which has led it to be respected by some, dreaded by others, is the zealous and the almost mystical devotion of its members to the notion of liberation war. Most Party members have historically conducted military, guerrilla, and assassination operations with little concern for their personal safety or survival. Saadeh himself had a very revolutionary view of life and death, whereas the Renaissance and the \\"New Generation\\" would not see the light of day without sacrifice: \\"we love life because we love freedom, and we love death when death is a path to life\\" is among the few quotes of Saadeh which the SSNP reveres. Since its foundation in 1932, the SSNP adopted direct action and violence against those it deemed as the enemies of the Syrian People, to which it referred to as the \\"forces of darkness\\", while the founder referred to the Party as the \\"Sons of Life\\" (Abna\` al-Hayat): Colonialism and particularly French colonialism in Syria and Lebanon, the feudal landowning and notable class, politicians it deemed to be traitors or corrupt, Zionist settlement of Palestine, Christian separatism in Lebanon, Islamic fundamentalism in Syria, a list to which could be added the communists, although this last addition would change in the course of the years as both would join ranks in the LNRF. The flag of the Lebanese National Resistance Front, a coalition of armed groups that assembled to fight off the Israeli invasion of Lebanon In 1949, it declared the \\"First Renaissance Revolution\\" against the Lebanese government, an armed confrontation with the Lebanese and Syrian security forces that ended in a disaster and the execution of Antun Saadeh by the Lebanese authorities on 8 July. Not too long later, party members assassinated the Lebanese Prime Minister Riad al-Solh who was instrumental in Saadeh's death penalty. To avoid being caught, the assailants committed suicide. When one of the assailants survived and woke up in the hospital, he completed his suicide attempt by tearing up his wounds and falling from the bed. The assassination of the general prosecutor who judged Saadeh was also conducted by a Party cell, and Party members are believed to have been involved in the assassination of Husni al-Zaim, the Syrian dictator who captured Saadeh and handed him over to the Lebanese authorities.See: Adel Beshara, Outright Assassination, the Trial and Execution of Antun Saadeh (Ithaca, 2010) In 1982, party member Habib al-Shartouni assassinated the Lebanese President Bachir Gemayel, the leader of the Lebanese Forces, who had asked for the Israelis to invade Lebanon all the way up to Beirut, and with the consent of whom the Siege of Beirut was effectuated. The party also undertook many operations against Israeli presence in Lebanon, including a military operation in broad daylight against Israeli officers stationed in Beirut, which triggered the beginning of the generalized armed struggle for Lebanese liberation. Sana'a Mehaidli, whose family had been displaced and was forced to live homeless after the Israeli occupation, detonated herself in her car along with an Israeli convoy in south Lebanon. The party joined arms with the communists, the PLO, the Arab nationalists, and other groups to fight against the Israeli invasion, leading to the break of the siege and to the withdrawal of the Israelis from Beirut. Today, the party's military wing fights alongside the Syrian Arab Army against the FSA and ISIS. SSNP in Turkey & the As-Safira Incident Antoun Saadeh once stated in a speech in Beirut on October 16, 1947 that \\"The SSNP while against the forces of Stalin and Hitler should seek out its cult of personality and in it revise itself in a way that is best appropriate for the Syrian people\\" this speech apparently caught the attention of around 40 Turkish advisors trying to convince Beirut for an economic deal with Turkey instead of Syria, these advisors then told the then president Mustafa ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º on October 17, 1947 in which he stated that \\"Antoun Saadeh is the only one leading this joke of a political party and thus needed to get him out of the picture if Turkey seeks to gain influence in Lebanon\\", he said that on October 20, 1947 just 3 days after he learned of the party from his advisors, however he only mentioned the party twice and the second time he mentioned this party was on July 15, 1949 when after accusations by the SSNP that Turkey played a part in the death of Antoun Saadeh he declared \\"Antoun Saadeh is an usurper who takes pride in authoritarianism and is indeed not based on the natural Syrian establishment, he thus signaled his own death but us Turks would not have pride in that it is of a Syrian people taking down an archaic belief and man\\" however to this day many SSNP members believe he played a role in the death of Antoun Saadeh as he saw him as a threat. On December 21, 2017 Erdogan stated that the SSNP is a terrorist organization after the Eagles of the Whirlwind attacked a Turkish convoy on December 6, 2017 traveling from al-Bab to Idlib the attack killed around 3 Turks and 27 Syrians and it was suspected that ISIS or Al Qaeda or even the Kurds, (Syria was actually ruled out due to the unconventional way of the attack until December 11, 2017) was responsible however but they never claimed responsibility and on December 11, 2017 Eagles of the Whirlwind and the Syrian Arab Army declared responsibility and on December 12, 2017 the attack was condemned by the United States, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Norway, Germany, France and the United Kingdom as well as the United Nations and Arab League. The Turks estimated that the convoy was attacked by a group of 6 soldiers and not the Eagles of the Whirlwind however the group declared those 6 persons were soldiers and members, the attack happened in As-Safira when the convoy taking around 3 Turks and 53 Syrians was attacked, this was the only attack the Eagles of the Whirlwind ever claimed and presumably ever committed this was also the only time Erdogan ever mentioned the Eagles of the Whirlwind and by extension the Syrian Social Nationalist Party being the second Turkish president to do so and the third time it was ever mentioned by a Turkish president ever held in historical records. On December 22, 2017 Tahrir al-Sham accused the group of using tear gas and Grenades to kill however both Turkey and the Eagles of the Whirlwind confirmed that only Ak-47's were used, both Tahrir al-Sham and Turkey claimed the group was going to Idlib for economic reasons not military or political this however was rejected by Rojava, the PKK and Syria plus Iraq, Iran and Hezbollah and even Iraqi Kurdistan as well as Lebanon with Bashar al-Assad claiming the group was screaming Allahu Akbar & rasing ISIS flags as well as that of Tahrir al-Sham on December 22, 2017, this was rejected by Turkey until a video circulated on December 23, 2017 showing exacly that and so on December 24, 2017 Erdogan declared that it was not a civilian convoy and stated the group was justified to attack it with since it was filled with Jihadists. Only Tahrir al-Sham condemning it as a civilian targeted attack since December 24, 2017. On January 1, 2018 Ali Haidar praised the attack stating that \\"Thousands fought, hundreds died but 6 killed.\\" and he stated that this was the only real attack instead of fight or battle that occurred comparing it to the Houla massacre, his statement received condemnation by the United Nations on January 2, 2018 and he was fired from leading the Eagles of the Whirlwind on January 3, 2018 by general secretary or president of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party Hanna El Nashif for his repulsiveness and she took control of the militia from then on, on December 6, 2018 a party of around 65 people in Damascus celebrated the anniversary and around 800 in Beirut, the party in Beirut was so large the government dispersed and banned them which killed 2 people and injured around 120 people, on December 6, 2019 a party of 1,200 Syrians in Damascus celebrated the 2nd anniversary of the incident. On December 6, 2019, Syria officially made December 6 a holiday to celebrate the attack. To this day there is no evidence that the Eagles of the Whirlwind or Syrian Social Nationalist Party perpetrated the attack and it was probably committed by the Syrian Armed Forces. There is no evidence those six soldiers knew of or sympathized with the SSNP let alone joined. The six soldiers who perpetrated the attack remained missing since, leading some to believe that they were killed by the rest of the caravan or by an ambush, the Syrian government offered to pay them 30k$ each equal to 90k$, the typical amount of a general not a soldier. All six men are Sunnis from Idlib. On March 14, 2020 all six bodies were discovered in the city confirming the presumed report that they died from a gun fight and on March 14, 2020 Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and Iran's Ali Khamenei declared them martyr's. On June 1, 2020 Abdul-Malik Badreddin al- Houthi claimed that Saudi Arabia learned of the gun fight and that they bombed the six men involved after seeing them fire upon the convoy, he also claimed that Israel helped Saudi Arabia locate the six men through satellite imagery that Saudi Arabia lacks, he claimed that Turkey and the the West had no knowledge of the attack. As of October 1, 2020 the attack is internationally recognized by everyone as a Syrian offensive against Tahrir al-Sham, except by Tahrir al-Sham who claims they were Alawites who killed a convoy of Turkish and Syrian Sunni civilians and regards it as the As-Safira Massacre while it is internationally recognized as the As-Safira Incident.Hourani, p. 326 Emblem and flag The party's emblem is the whirlwind (in Arabic Zawba'a, ÿ≤Ÿàÿ®ÿπÿ©). It was designed by the SSNP students at the American University of Beirut while the party was still clandestine and before the French authorities had uncovered it in 1936. Saadeh stated the whirlwind was found engraved on ancient Syrian artifacts, and it is known from for example Sumerian art. The SSNP emblem has been said to be a combination of the Islamic crescent and the Christian cross. The party flag features a red hurricane, called the Zawba'a, within a white disc on a black background. Each arm symbolizes one of the four virtues of the party's mission: freedom, duty, discipline and power. According to SSNP lore, the black color symbolizes the Dark Ages of Ottoman rule, colonialism, sectarian division, national division, and backwardness. The Zawba'a allegedly represents the blood of the SSNP martyrs bound together as Muslims and Christians through freedom, duty, discipline and power as a hurricane to purge the Dark Ages and spark their nation's rejuvenation and renaissance. Critics claim that the symbol was modeled after the Nazi swastika also pages 111-112 in the edition of Cornell University Press, 1967: \\"Thus, the Syrian national anthem for the PPS sang \\"Syria, Syria uber alles\\" to the same familiar tune of \\"Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles\\" (176) The hand gestures in saluting and the \\"long live the leader\\" bore striking resemblances to the Nazi practice. The swastika was replaced with a hurricane as a PPS symbol, (177) while the storm or combat troops were present in both. Both Hitler and Saadeh, in addition to having the same title of 'the leader', held and exercised all legislative and executive authority.\\" a claim that the party denies. Criticism=Ideological criticism Despite Saadeh's claims, authors state that when the party began overt activity, it was the object of many critiques due to having many ideological and organizational resemblances to European fascism, and due to the resemblance of its external symbols to those of German Nazism. Such resemblances went against the idea that it was an authentic national ideology and couldn't be acknowledged by the party. Saadeh was aware of these accusations, and he addressed them during his speech of 1 June 1935: Arab nationalist thinker Sati' al-Husri considered that Saadeh \\"misrepresented\\" Arab nationalism, incorrectly associating it with a Bedouin image of the Arab and with Muslim sectarianism. Palestinian historian Maher Charif sees Saadeh's theory as a response to the religious diversity of Syria, and points to his later extension of his vision of the Syrian nation to include Iraq, a country also noted for its religious diversity, as further evidence for this.Charif, p. 216 The party also accepted that due to \\"religious and political considerations\\", the separate existence of Lebanon was necessary for the time being. From 1945 onward, the party adopted a more nuanced stance regarding Arab nationalism, seeing Syrian unity as a potential first step towards an Arab union led by Syria. Scholarly criticism Lebanese historian Kamal Salibi gives a somewhat contrasting interpretation, pointing to the position of the Greek Orthodox community as a large minority in both Syria and Lebanon for whom \\"the concept of pan-Syrianism was more meaningful than the concept of Arabism\\" while at the same time they resented Maronite dominance in Lebanon. According to Salibi, > Saadeh found a ready following among his co-religionists. His idea of > secular pan-Syrianism also proved attractive to many Druzes and Shiites; to > Christians other than the Greek Orthodox, including some Maronites who were > disaffected by both Lebanism and Arabism; and also to many Sunnite Muslims > who set a high value on secularism, and who felt that they had far more in > common with their fellow Syrians of whatever religion or denomination than > with fellow Sunnite or Muslim Arabs elsewhere. Here again, an idea of > nationalism had emerged which had sufficient credit to make it valid. In the > Lebanese context, however, it became ready cover for something more archaic, > which was essentially Greek Orthodox particularism.Kamal Salibi (1988, > 1998), pp. 54-55 Prof. Salibi remarks on the beginnings of Saadeh's party in the 1930s: \\"[A]mong its first members were students and young graduates of the American University of Beirut.\\" This early party was \\"mainly Greek Orthodox and Protestants with some Shi'ites and Druzes....\\" In Lebanon as a whole the party was not popular. \\"Christians were generally opposed to their Syrian unionism, while Moslems were suspicious of their reservations with regard to pan- Arabism. The Lebanese authorities were able to suppress them without difficulty.\\"K. S. Salibi, The Modern History of Lebanon (New York: Praeger 1965) at 180. According to historian Stanley G. Payne, the Arab nationalism was influenced by European fascism, with the creation of at least seven Arab nationalist shirt movements similar to the brown shirt movement by 1939, with the most influenced ones being the SSNP, the Iraqi Futawa youth movement and the Young Egypt movement. These three movements would share characteristics like being territorially expansionist, with the SSNP wanting the complete control of Syria, belief in the superiority of their own people (with Saadeh theorizing a \\"distinct and naturally superior\\" Syrian race), being \\"nonrationalist, anti-intellectual, and highly emotional\\" and \\"[emphasizing] military virtues and power [and stressing] self-sacrifice\\". Also according to Payne, all these movements received strong influence from European fascism and praised the Italian and German fascism but \\"[they never became] fully developed fascist movements, and none reproduced the full characteristics of European fascism\\"; the influence in Arab nationalism remained long after 1945. Also, Saadeh's superior race was not a pure one, but a fusion of all races in Syrian history. The SSNP would be \\"[a] elite group, with little structure for mobilization\\".

Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Priory School\\" tenth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. Plot Holmes receives a visit from Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable, the founder and principal of a preparatory school called Priory School in Northern England. He beseeches Holmes to come back to Mackleton with him to look into the disappearance of one of his pupils, the ten-year-old Lord Saltire, whose father is the very rich and famous Duke of Holdernesse. Huxtable explains that not only the boy has disappeared, but also the German master, Heidegger, along with his bicycle. Once in the North, the Duke says to Holmes that he does not think that his estranged wife has anything to do with his son's disappearance, nor has there been a ransom demand. Holmes establishes that the boy and his kidnappers could not have used the nearby road without being seen, suggesting that they went cross-country. As if to confirm this, the police find the boy's school cap in some gypsies' possession. They swear that they simply found it on the moor, but the police lock them up. Holmes and Dr. Watson go hunting for clues. They find a bicycle track, but it is not Heidegger's; it does not match his tyres. Holmes observes that one tyre has a patch on it. Almost everything observable has been obliterated by cow tracks (which are the only marks on the ground anywhere). Eventually, Heidegger's bicycle tracks are found, and they end where he lies, dead. After that, Holmes and Watson arrive at the Fighting Cock Inn, and meet the innkeeper, Reuben Hayes, who seems startled indeed to hear that Holmes wants to go to Holdernesse Hall, the Duke's nearby house, to tell him news of his son. The two men have lunch there, and Holmes suddenly realises that he and Watson saw many cow tracks out on the moor, but never at any time did they see any cows. Furthermore, the patterns of the hoof prints were quite unusual, suggesting that the cow in question trotted, cantered, and galloped. Holmes and Watson sneak out to Hayes's stable and examine the horse's hooves. As Holmes has expected, there is evidence of recent shoeing, but with old shoes and new nails. Examining the nearby smithy, Holmes and Watson are rather belligerently asked to leave by Mr. Hayes. Holmes examines James Wilder's bicycle. Shortly afterwards, the two men hide as a cyclist comes along the road from the direction of the Duke's. It is James Wilder, the Duke's personal secretary, and he looks agitated. He arrives at the inn. Soon afterwards, a trap pulls out of the stable yard and goes along the road towards Chesterfield. A while later, someone else ‚Äì it is getting dark and only a fleeting glimpse of the new visitor is caught ‚Äì arrives at the inn. Coming closer, Holmes observes Wilder's bicycle tyres and notes that they are the same make as the first ones encountered on the moor. The next morning, they go to Holdernesse Hall, where they find that the Duke is not well. Nevertheless, Holmes demands from him a cheque for ¬£6000 (This calculation assumes that the story takes place in 1901, which is suggested by Leslie S. Klinger in Volume I (p. 768) of The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes (W. W. Norton, 2005).), saying that he has earned the reward. His son is at the Fighting Cock, and the accused is the Duke himself, but the actual mastermind of this crime is James Wilder, who has a terrible secret: He is the illegitimate son of the Duke. He conceived a plan to kidnap Lord Saltire to force the Duke to change his will, knowing very well that his father would not call the police on him, as he abhorred the very idea of scandal. The plan began to unravel when Wilder hired Hayes ‚Äì who has now fled, but been caught on Holmes's information ‚Äì to do the actual kidnapping. Hayes killed Heidegger, and when Wilder heard the news, he confessed all to his father. So anxious was the Duke to avoid scandal, he agreed to let his younger son stay at the inn for another three days, and to keep quiet, so that Hayes could flee justice. All ends well, except for Hayes, who faces the gallows. Lord Saltire is brought home from the inn and the Duke writes to his estranged wife asking her to reconcile with him. This he feels she will be willing to do, for the source of the friction between them is going away: James Wilder is being packed off to Australia to seek his fortune. As for the cow tracks, they were accomplished by shoeing the horses with special shoes shaped like cow's hooves.

In the dramatisation, Wilder takes Lord Saltire as a hostage in a chase led by Holmes, the Duke of Holdernesse, and Watson through a cavern under the moor, known as the \\"Cathedral\\". Having climbed to the top of a cliff-like structure with the boy, Wilder slips and falls to his death, while Lord Saltire is rescued. Also, in this version, the Duke volunteers a reward of ¬£6,000 early on, but in the end writes Holmes a cheque for ¬£12,000 ().

This blues song laments the devastation caused in the local African-American community by a flood on the normally shallow river. The river is deep with very sharp rocks. The river has historical significance due to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, an African- American youth visiting from Chicago, who was brutally murdered by white men in Money, Mississippi, for allegedly whistling at a white woman. He was beaten, shot, and sunk in the river with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck by barbed wire. This event is mentioned in the song, \\"Freedom Highway\\" by The Staple Singers, in the lines, \\"Found dead people in the forests, Tallahatchie River and lakes... whole world is wondering, what's wrong with the United States?\\" The eponymous wooden bridge over the river was popularized in Bobbie Gentry's 1967 hit song \\"Ode to Billie Joe,\\" which has the refrain, \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie bridge.\\" A film was titled Ode to Billy Joe. The wooden bridge collapsed in 1972 after being set alight by vandals. It crossed the Tallahatchie River at Money, about ten miles north of Greenwood, Mississippi. The bridge has since been replaced.

He served the Province of Georgia as a delegate to the Continental Congress and later the State of Georgia to the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787. Early life William Houston was the son of Sir Patrick Houston, a member of the council under the royal government of Georgia. He was born in 1755 in Savannah, Georgia. Houston received a liberal education, which included legal training at Inner Temple in London. Role in the Continental Congress The American Revolution cut short his training, and Houston returned home to Georgia. For many years members of Houston's family had been high officials in the colony. With the onset of war, many remained loyal to the crown, but William, a zealous advocate of colonists' rights, was among the first to counsel resistance to British aggression. Houston represented Georgia in the Continental Congress from 1783 through 1786. He was chosen as one of Georgia's agents to settle a boundary dispute with South Carolina in 1785 and was one of the original trustees of the University of Georgia at Athens. Delegate to the Georgia Convention When the Constitutional Convention convened in 1787, Houston presented his credentials as one of Georgia's delegates. He stayed for only a short time, from June 1 until about July 23, but he was present during the debate on the representation question. Houston split Georgia's vote on equal representation in the Senate, voting \\"nay\\" against Abraham Baldwin's \\"aye.\\" His fellow Georgia delegate William Pierce wrote of him: \\"As to his legal or political knowledge, he has very little to boast of. Nature seems to have done more for his corporeal than mental powers. His Person is striking, but his mind very little improved with useful or elegant knowledge.\\" Later life Houston married Mary Bayard, the daughter of Nicholas Bayard (baptized 1736), a member of the Bayard family, prominent in New York City, from which Bayard Street takes its name. Houston Street, originally part of his father-in-law's estate in the New York City Borough of Manhattan was named for Houston, using an alternate spelling. Houston died in Savannah on March 17, 1813, and was interred in St. Paul's Chapel in New York City.

It is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes and was published in 1904.  Timeline  According to William S. Baring-Gould's timeline of the Sherlock Holmes canon, the events of \\"Milverton\\" occurred in 1899. This was nine years after the strange death of Charles Augustus Howell, the real-life inspiration for the character of Milverton (see below). Plot (l. to r.) Watson, Holmes and Charles Augustus Milverton. Holmes is hired by the d√©butante Lady Eva Blackwell to retrieve compromising letters from a blackmailer: Milverton, who causes Holmes more revulsion than any of the 50-odd murderers in his career. Milverton is \\"the king of blackmailers\\". He demands ¬£7,000 (over ¬£800,000 in 2015) for the letters, which if given to third parties would cause a scandal that would end Lady Eva's marriage engagement. Holmes offers ¬£2,000, all Lady Eva can pay, but Milverton insists on ¬£7,000. It is worth ¬£7,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long-term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more \\"open to reason\\" and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not. Holmes resolves to recover the letters by whatever means necessary, as Milverton has placed himself outside the bounds of morality. Holmes visits Milverton's Hampstead house, disguised as a plumber, in order to learn the plan of the house and Milverton's daily routine. He cultivates the acquaintance of Milverton's housemaid and even becomes engaged to marry her. This rather shocks Watson, but Holmes assures him that he has a hated rival who will step in when the plumber disappears. Holmes has learned where Milverton keeps his blackmail papers (a safe in his study), and plans to burgle Milverton's house that night. Watson comes along. They break into the study, but just as Holmes opens the safe, Milverton enters the study, even though he should be in bed asleep. Holmes and Watson hide behind a curtain, while Milverton has a midnight meeting with a supposed maidservant offering to sell letters that would compromise her mistress. Milverton's death The woman is actually one of Milverton's former victims, whose broken-hearted husband died when she wouldn't pay Milverton and he revealed her secret. Now she avenges her husband by shooting Milverton to death, then stamps on his face. Watson instinctively begins to rush out and stop the shooting, but Holmes restrains him. Holmes understands, and Watson instantly realises, \\"that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain...\\" The woman runs away, and Milverton's household is roused by the shots. During his final confrontation, Milverton's entire cache of blackmail papers had been in a safe with its door slightly ajar. Holmes now feeds this mass of compromising material into Milverton's burning fireplace, despite the risk of being discovered and caught. Then Holmes and Watson escape through the garden and over the wall. Watson has to kick himself free from a pursuer who has grabbed his leg. The next morning, Inspector Lestrade calls at Baker Street to ask for Holmes' help in investigating Milverton's murder, which he ascribes to the two burglars seen escaping over the garden wall. He has a description of one of them: \\"a middle-aged, strongly built man-square jaw, thick neck, moustache...\\" Holmes calls that vague. \\"Why, it might be a description of Watson!\\" he says, which amuses Lestrade. But Holmes refuses Lestrade's request: \\"My sympathies are with the criminals, and I will not handle the case.\\" Later, Holmes recognises the face of the woman who killed Milverton. He shows Watson her photograph displayed in a shop-window among those of other celebrities. Watson recognises the name of her famous husband, but Holmes signals silence with a finger to his lips. Watson assures his readers that the killer in question is beyond the reach of the law [i.e deceased] and that certain details have been disguised to hurt no one.  Inspiration  The character of Charles Augustus Milverton was based on a real blackmailer, Charles Augustus Howell. He was an art dealer who preyed upon an unknown number of people, including the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Doyle's literary inspiration often came from his natural interest in crime, and he had no tolerance for predators. Howell died in 1890 in circumstances as strange as any of Doyle's novels: His body was found near a Chelsea public house with his throat posthumously slit, with a half-Sovereign coin in his mouth. The presence of the coin was known to be a criticism of those guilty of slander. \\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\\" was also inspired by the A. J. Raffles short story \\"Wilful Murder\\" by E. W. Hornung, according to Richard Lancelyn Green. Publication history \\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\\" was first published in the US in Collier's on 26 March 1904. In the UK, it was first published in The Strand Magazine in April 1904.Smith (2014), p. 128. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 124. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110. Adaptations=Film and television The story was adapted as a short silent film titled Charles Augustus Milverton (1922) in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes. The 1932 film The Missing Rembrandt, part of the 1931‚Äì1937 film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, was loosely based on the story. The story was faithfully adapted in the 1965 BBC series Sherlock Holmes with Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, and Barry Jones as Milverton. The only difference from the story is the identity of Milverton's killer. The Soviet television film series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson featured the case under the name \\"The King of Blackmail\\". It was the first of the three episodes concerning Professor Moriarty. Apparently, Milverton (played by Boris Ryzhukhin) was a member of the gang, since certain papers were recovered from his office which helped implicate the Professor. The husband of the lady who kills Milverton is stated to be named Lord Christopher Huxley, aged 42, with Holmes reading an article about his death at the beginning of the episode. Holmes approaches the lady (played by Valentina Panina) later to obtain the aforementioned papers which she took with her. Otherwise, it is faithful to the original. The story was much extrapolated when adapted by screenwriter Jeremy Paul for Granada Television series Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett. It became the 1992 feature-length episode The Master Blackmailer and featured Robert Hardy as the eponymous reptilian Milverton.} Holmes's relationship with the maid is expanded upon, allowing Brett to suggest Holmes' buried tenderness and inability, or unwillingness, to indulge in matters of the heart. Milverton's face is not shown until Watson meets him while viewing artwork at a gallery. The violence of the villain's end, including the grisly grinding of the avenger's heel into the dead Milverton's bespectacled face, is faithfully adapted, but Holmes and Watson do not at the end gaze upon Milverton's killer's portrait, as the murderess is identified. Deviating from the original story, Holmes holds a very different opinion about the case's end. He requests Watson not to chronicle the case, deeming it to have unpleasant circumstances, whereas in the original story Holmes is slightly more cheerful, as shown by his joking to Lestrade, which is omitted from this adaption. The \\"Dead Man's Switch\\" episode of the CBS crime drama Elementary loosely adapts the story, with Milverton as a professional blackmailer who contacts his \\"clients\\" and prevents his own exposure by informing them that he has an accomplice who will distribute the damaging material if Milverton is arrested. Milverton is brought to Holmes's attention when he blackmails the family of a rape victim, the family being known to Holmes's addiction sponsor. The case is complicated when Holmes witnesses Milverton's murder while infiltrating his house. Holmes is compelled to locate Milverton's accomplice, who has access to all of Milverton's material and instructions to post it on the Internet if Milverton is caught or killed. The third season of the BBC adaptation Sherlock features 'Charles Augustus Magnussen', portrayed by Lars Mikkelsen, as a primary antagonist. The episode \\"His Last Vow\\" aired 12 January 2014. In it, it is revealed that Charles Magnussen keeps the information with which he blackmails his victims in his own mind palace (inside his head), only occasionally acquiring hard copies when he has to. Despite Mycroft warning Sherlock to leave Magnussen alone as he is occasionally useful to the government, he is shot dead by Sherlock in order to free John from his power and guarantee Mary's safety, as Sherlock realizes by using his mind palace he has no actual evidence in the event of his death. The episode \\"The Adventure of the Portrait of a Teacher\\" in the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes is loosely based on the story. In it, a portrait of history teacher Charles Augustus Milverton that Beppo draws in class is taken away by himself. Milverton is said to be the severest with pupils in Beeton School and Beppo requests Holmes to take it back. Holmes and Watson steal into the teacher's room where they see a female pupil Agatha, who is tutored by Milverton privately because she is too nervous to attend class with other pupils. She tells them that he is kind and in fact they find Milverton, who goes back to his room for an shocking sight Radio A radio adaptation titled \\"Charles Augustus Milverton\\" aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 18 May 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 29. Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode, titled \\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\\", aired on 4 December 1939.Dickerson (2019), p. 89. The story was combined with A Study in Scarlet for a radio adaptation titled \\"Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes\\", which aired on the BBC Light Programme on 5 October 1954 as the first of a series of episodes featuring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on NBC radio on 2 January 1955.Dickerson (2019), p. 284. Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a 1961 radio drama that aired on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. \\"Charles Augustus Milverton\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Vaughan as Milverton. The story was adapted as a 2008 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Charles Augustus Milverton was played by the creator of Imagination Theatre, Jim French. Other media The story, along with \\"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\\", \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", and \\"The Red-Headed League\\", provided the source material for the play The Return of Sherlock Holmes. In Gerald Lientz's 1987 gamebook Death at Appledore Towers (Sherlock Holmes Solo Mysteries number 3) Watson's cousin, a prot√©g√© of Holmes, investigates Milverton's murder after Holmes has refused to do so. In Donald Thomas's collection of short stories, The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes (1997), Watson \\"admits\\" that Milverton was, in fact, an alias used for the real Charles Augustus Howell. The story also serves as the basis for Thomas's short story in the collection of the same name, \\"The Execution of Sherlock Holmes\\", in which Milverton's brother Henry (and several other relatives of Holmes's past adversaries) kidnap Holmes and stage a kangaroo court, putting Holmes \\"on trial\\" for the murder of Milverton.

The term arrayers is used in some ancient English statutes, for an officer who had a commission of array. History Commissions of array developed from the ancient obligation of all free men to defend their tribal lands. Commissioners were usually experienced soldiers, appointed by the crown to array able bodied men from each shire. By the time of the Wars of the Roses, conscript levies were less important than troops raised by indenture. Medieval examplesCommission from Glendower rebellion 1403= A Commission of Array was established in October 1403 by King Henry IV by letters patent to raise an army to resist the Welsh rebellion of Owen Glendower, who had recently captured Newport Castle. The commission issued by the king at Gloucester on 7 October 1403 to leading members of the local gentry was as follows: > Commission to Maurice Russell, Gilbert Dynys, John Rolves and John > Harsefelde to assemble all the able fencible men, footmen and horsemen, of > the hundreds of Barton Regis by Bristol, Hembury, Pokelchurche, Thornbury, > Grymboldesasshe, Berkeley and Whiston and bring them sufficiently armed to > the town of Chepstowe by Thursday next at the latest to go with the King or > his lieutenant to Wales to resist the rebels bringing with them victuals for > 4 days and to take horses from those who have them who cannot labour and > deliver them to those who can labour but lack horses.

Both decrees were issued in order to attempt to gain control of existing militia forces and to raise further troops. The Commission of Array issued by the king thus sought to muster a Royalist army at the onset of the English Civil War.Andriette, Eugene A., Devon and Exeter in the Civil War, Newton Abbot, 1971, p.56 Commissioners were appointed for each county, generally from leading members of the local aristocracy and gentry who might be assumed to wield great influence over their feudal tenants and the population in general. The commissioners proceeded to the major population centres and read out in public gatherings the text of their commission. Frequently such innovative royal decrees, uncertain in precedent and purpose, were met with open hostility on the part of the local inhabitants who suspected them as being instruments designed for general suppression of the people. Opponents of the king, whilst playing down the role of the Militia Ordinance in augmenting civil strife, portrayed the Commission of Array as being a sign that it was the king and not Parliament who was the real aggressor in the developing conflict.Andriette, p.57 =Devon= 28 Commissioners of Array were appointed in Devon on 19 July 1642, including: *Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath *Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester *George Southcote of Buckland Tout Saints, appointed but apparently never acted as he was appointed Sheriff of Devon during the Commonwealth, father of Thomas Southcote (c. 1622‚Äì1664), of Buckland Tout Saints, MP. *Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet (c. 1591‚Äì1647) See also * Posse comitatus ReferencesBibliography *1828 Webster's Dictionary * English Civil War Military history of the United Kingdom Military command staff occupations ","title":"Commission of array"},{"id":"1337765","text":"Bie≈°ankoviƒçy (also spelled Beshenkovichy, Beshankovichy) (; ; ) is a town in the Vitebsk Province of Belarus and a port on the Western Dvina river. It is west of Vitebsk on the railway line between Orsha and Lepiel. The population is 6,647 (2017).  History  In the early 16th century, the small village was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ruled by the Drucki-Sokoli≈Ñski princes. In 1552 it numbered 34 houses. In 1630, the village was purchased by the Vilnius Voivode Kazimierz Leon Sapieha. It underwent rapid expansion and was granted Magdeburg rights in 1634. At that time, new stone houses were built and trade fairs were held semiannually, frequented by 4 to 5 thousand visitors from Belarus, Russia and abroad. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, control of the village was passed to the Russian Empire. By the end of the 18th century, Bie≈°ankoviƒçy was a township of the Lepel Uyezd and later became the center of the volost. According to an 1897 census, the town's population was 4,423 people, there were 1,099 buildings, a post office, a telegraph, a school, 3 people's schools, 127 shops and a hospital. At that time, Bie≈°ankoviƒçy was a largely Jewish settlement, numbering 3,182 Jewish citizens in 1900. The Jewish Encyclopedia (published between 1901 and 1906), describes the town's population as four fifths Jewish of whom 576 are artisans. The town had a synagogue, many houses of prayer, three benevolent societies, and numerous religious schools. Under Soviet power, Bie≈°ankoviƒçy became an urban settlement and was the center of the raion for several years. It later became part of the Vitebsk oblast. In 1939, 1,119 Jews lived in the town, making up 26.3% of the total population. During the second world war, Bie≈°ankoviƒçy was occupied by the German Army from 6 July 1941 to 25 June 1944 and was almost entirely destroyed. 10,276 persons from Bie≈°ankoviƒçy and the raion were massacred, including the entire Jewish population.Beshankovichy. Holocaust A resident at the time of the German occupation recalled, \\"One Jewish family that had not been taken to the ghetto was still living on my street. When the Jews were being gathered for the shooting, the Germans came to get this family. A little Jewish boy was hiding in the fireplace. The Germans found him and shot him right there, in the house.\\" The town was recaptured on 25 June 1944 by the 1st Baltic Front. References External links  * Beshankovichy.

Plot Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in a university town when a tutor and lecturer of St Luke's College, Mr. Hilton Soames, brings him an interesting problem. Soames had been reviewing the galley proofs of an exam he was going to give when he left his office for an hour. When he returned, he found that his servant, Bannister, had entered the room but accidentally left his key in the lock when he left, and someone had disturbed the exam papers on his desk and left traces that show it had been partially copied. Bannister is devastated and collapses on a chair, but swears that he did not touch the papers. Soames found other clues in his office: pencil shavings, a broken pencil lead, a fresh cut in his desk surface, and a small blob of black clay speckled with sawdust. Soames wants to uncover the cheater and prevent him from taking the exam, since it is for a sizeable scholarship. Three students who will take the exam live above him in the same building. The first, Gilchrist, is athletic, being a hurdler and a long-jumper, and industrious (in contrast to his father who squandered his fortune in horse racing); the second, Daulat Ras, is described as quiet and methodical; the third is Miles McLaren, a gifted man but thoroughly dissolute and given to gambling. Holmes examines the office. The cheater obviously took the papers over to the window one by one while he copied them so that he could see Soames returning, but as it happens, Soames did not come back the usual way. A nearby door leads to Soames's bedroom. Upon examining that, Holmes finds another, similar, sawdust- speckled blob of clay. He stuns Soames by telling him that the cheater, upon hearing his approach, hid in Soames's bedroom. He was there, hiding behind a curtain, all the time that Soames was questioning Bannister. The next morning, Holmes and Watson return to Soames's office. Holmes confronts Bannister who he believes is not telling all he knows. Bannister will not own up to anything, and insists that there was no-one in Soames's office while he was there. Holmes, however, sends for Gilchrist, and proceeds to lay out his results. Gilchrist, confronted by Holmes, breaks down The cheater was someone who knew the exam proofs were there. This could only be Gilchrist because the proofs' whereabouts had been kept secret, and Gilchrist was the only one tall enough to look in through Soames's window to see his desk. Holmes has also identified the blobs as the special clay found in the long-jump pit, further implicating Gilchrist. Gilchrist reveals his guilt by reproaching Bannister for his apparent treachery. Bannister was indeed the one who covered for Gilchrist. He felt that he had to, for old times' sake: Bannister was once Gilchrist's father's butler. Holmes then explains the remaining clues. The scratch on the desk was caused by Gilchrist's spiked jumping shoes as he grabbed them in his haste, and the clay blobs fell from his shoes. Bannister had collapsed in the chair to hide Gilchrist's gloves, which he saw had been left on the chair. For his part, Gilchrist credits Bannister with convincing him not to profit from his misdeed, and presents Soames with a letter stating his wish not to sit the exam, but accept an offer in South Africa for the Rhodesian Police.

Founded in 1894. It is a day and boarding school educating boys from ages four to 18. It is one of the eight Northern Irish schools represented on the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and is a member of the Independent Schools Council. The school occupies a estate in east Belfast, close to the Parliament Buildings at Stormont. All the school's facilities are located on this site, which also contains a small lake and forest named Netherleigh. Campbell's junior school ‚Äì formerly located on an adjacent site and called Cabin Hill ‚Äì is now also located on the site. The school has the oldest Combined Cadet Force in Ireland, with over 400 cadets.Hansard, publications.parliament.uk; accessed 17 March 2017. The school has an international reputation and attracts boarders from all over the world. Past pupils of the school are known as Old Campbellians or OCs and the school has an extensive past pupil organisation known as The Old Campbellian Society which has several branches across the United Kingdom, USA and Asia as well as regular OC reunions at the school itself. The school colours are black and white, whilst the OC colours are black, white and green. History It was founded in 1894 with a bequest by Henry James Campbell, made his fortune in the linen trade, and left money to found a school based on the values of a Liberal Protestant education. Initially the school was primarily a boarding school but it has, particularly since the 1970s, become primarily a day school; in 2009 it had 879 pupils, only about 85 (10%) of whom were boarders. As a selective independent school, it admits pupils based on academic selection. Until 2006 pupils began at the school at age 11, but since the closure of the school's separate preparatory school, Cabin Hill, the school has accepted pupils from age 4 into the newly built Junior School, and both boys and girls into the school's kindergarten located on the school's grounds. The Latin motto of the school is Ne Obliviscaris (\\"Do Not Forget\\"). Campbell College Central Hall was one of many hosting locations across Belfast and Ulster where the Ulster Covenant was signed by many in opposition to home rule on 28 September 1912. In 1935 Jimmy Steele led an attempted Irish Republican Army raid on the school to secure the arms inside the college Officers' Training Corps. The RUC at Strandtown was tipped off and the raid was unsuccessful. A gun battle took place at the gate lodge on Hawthornden Road in which Constable Ian Hay received five gunshot wounds, but survived.Northern Whig, 30 December 1935, pg. 3 (includes photograph) In 1936 Steele and three other IRA members were captured, prosecuted and imprisoned in Crumlin Road Gaol.John McGuffin, Internment (1973), irishresistancebooks.com; accessed 17 March 2017. Campbell lost 126 former students in World War I. During World War II the school was requisitioned by the War Office as a hospital, with the pupils transferred to Portrush, north Antrim. There are separate memorials to the dead of both World Wars in the Central Hall.Haines, Keith. Neither rogues nor fools ‚Äì a history of Campbell College. Belfast, Campbell College, 1993. The author C.S. Lewis, who grew up nearby, attended the school for two months, but was withdrawn because of a serious respiratory illness and sent to Malvern (Cherbourg School), famous at the time for treating people with lung problems. The gas lamppost on the school drive is claimed to have been the inspiration for that mentioned in Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, though some sources state a lamppost in Crawfordsburn Country Park was the inspiration.www.i-uk.comwww.visitbritain.com Still others believe that the gas lamps in the lower area of the woods on the Malvern Hills above the town were his inspiration. Several Campbell students have been involved in filmmaking. These include William MacQuitty (A Night to Remember), Andrew Eaton (Resurrection Man), Nick Hamm (The Hole), Dudi Appleton (The Most Fertile Man in Ireland), and Mark Huffam (Saving Private Ryan). Composer David Catherwood is currently director of music at Campbell. A collection of Lepidoptera by Thomas Workman is displayed in the school. On 27 October 2016, the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins visited Linen Hall Library for the first time. A choir combining students from Holy Cross Boys‚Äô Primary School and Campbell College performed at the special event. School houses Currently there are six houses for day boys and one boarding house and these form the focus for participation across the curriculum. School houses are named after former masters and those of importance in the life of the school and play an integral part in everyday life in the school. The names of the current houses and their respective colours are: * Alden's (Dark Green) * Allison's (Light Green, formerly Brown) * Davis's (Yellow) * Dobbin's (Light Blue) * Price's (Dark Blue) * School House (Boarding House) (Black) * Yates's (Red) In the past there have been other Houses: * Armour's (Grey) * Bowen's (Maroon) * Lytle's (Dark Green) * Netherleigh (Junior House) (Light Blue) * Norwood (Junior House) (Dark Green) * Ormiston (Junior House) (Dark Blue) * Tweskard (Junior House) (Red) * Chase's (Orange) Each house is run by a 'house master' who is in charge of managing the house, and overseeing the 'house tutors' all of whom have allocated year groups, of which they are responsible for. Each house has a designated student who is 'head of house', and they usually have a deputy. However, this is not always the case. The head of house, along with his deputy are 6th form students who have earned responsibility within the school, and it is common place for them to also be prefects, or so called \\"peer mentors\\". These two students organise house sporting, charity and dramatic events, among various other things. Uniform School colours are black and white and/or green if one is awarded major honours which enables one to also acquire a green blazer accompanied by an optional green pullover. The school uniform consists of a black badged blazer, House tie (with colour representing house), black trousers, black shoes with an optional V-neck pullover. Sport The school has a strong record in rugby, having won the Ulster Schools Cup 24 times and shared the cup four times. In 2018 Campbell beat Royal School Armagh at Ravenhill. The school has extensive sports facilities including rugby and football pitches, two water based hockey pitches, 25-metre indoor shooting range, four tennis courts, squash courts, a fitness suite, and a swimming pool. The 2006 opening of the new synthetic hockey pitches was marked with an exhibition match between the gold-winning 1988 Summer Olympics Great Britain and Northern Ireland hockey team and the school's 1st XI, which ended 3‚Äì2 to the Olympic champions of old. The Campbellians Hockey Club play at this venue. Colours A student can be awarded his \\"colours\\" as a tangible recognition of success achieved, dedication demonstrated and good example shown through the medium of any Campbell sport which participates in external/extramural competition, or through the College's music and drama programme. The Colours system is divided into two categories, that is, Major Colours and Club Colours: * The award of Major Colours permits the successful recipient to wear a green blazer with appropriate badge, a major colours tie and a green V-neck pullover. * Club Colours are denoted by a different pocket on the black school blazer, the pocket design reflecting the student‚Äôs preferred discipline. As a rule of thumb, Major Colours for sporting activities are gained by those who have successfully represented their senior team or age group team, in their respective sport throughout the season of the award, while demonstrating a high level of performance and an approach which is both dedicated and a fine example to their peers. The award of Club Colours has two main functions. Firstly, the Colour acts as a reward given to senior boys who have not necessarily represented one of our first teams, been placed highly in individual sports competition or excelled in the areas of music or drama, but whose dedication and loyalty to the schools‚Äôs curriculum is unquestionable. Secondly, this Colour may be awarded to younger students as recognition of their success at what might be considered to be the developmental stage of their school career. Students are nominated for Major and Club Colours by the member of staff in charge of the given activity to the Colours Committee. The Colours Committee comprises teaching staff whose interests within our total curriculum are wide and whose experience is considerable. Following due consideration and deliberation, decisions made by the Colours Committee are taken by its chairman to the Headmaster for his agreement.

Plot One wretched November night, Inspector Stanley Hopkins visits Holmes at 221B Baker Street to discuss the violent death of Willoughby Smith, secretary to aged invalid Professor Coram. Coram had dismissed his previous two secretaries. The murder happened at Yoxley Old Place near Chatham, Kent, with a sealing-wax knife of the professor's as the weapon. Hopkins can identify no motive for the killing, with Smith having no enemies or trouble in his past. Smith was found by Coram's maid, who recounts his last words as \\"The professor; it was she.\\" The maid further told Hopkins that prior to the murder she heard Smith leave his room and walk down to the study; she had been hanging curtains and did not see him, only recognizing his brisk step. The professor was in bed at the time. A minute later, a hoarse scream issued from the study, and the maid, hesitating briefly, inspected and found the murder. She later tells Holmes that Smith went out for a walk not long before the murder. The murderer's only likely means of entry was through the back door after walking along the path from the road, and Hopkins found some indistinct footmarks running beside the path, the murderer obviously seeking to leave no trail. Hopkins could not tell whether the track was coming or going, made by big or small feet. The professor's study contained a bureau; nothing seemed to have been stolen. Its drawers were left open, as was normal, and the cupboard in the middle was locked. The professor kept the key. Hard bridge pince nez glasses with chain and earhook. A lone piece of evidence was found in Willoughby Smith's hand: a pair of golden pince-nez glasses. Holmes examines these and from them alone deduces the following details of the murderer: *It is a woman; *She is of some good breeding; *She dresses like a lady; *She is a person of refinement, and is well dressed *She has a thick nose; *Her eyes are close together; *She has a puckered forehead, a peering look, and likely rounded shoulders; *She has been to an optician at least twice over the last few months. Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Hopkins head to Yoxley the next morning, and Holmes carefully examines the site. In the study, he notices a recent scratch on the bureau, and reasons that the murderer intended to access its contents. Smith was killed as his presence interfered with the burglary. No one saw the murderer leave, nor did anyone hear a door opening. Holmes notes that both the corridors, the one leading from the back door and the one leading to the professor's bedroom, are about the same length, and lined with coconut matting. Holmes interviews the professor in his bedroom, smoking many Egyptian cigarettes and dropping the ashes all over the floor. The professor claims utter ignorance regarding the murder, and ventures that Smith's death may be suicide. Holmes asks about the locked cupboard in the bureau. The professor hands over the key. Holmes simply inspects the key and returns it immediately, leaving the bureau sealed. Watson asks Holmes if he has a clue, and Holmes tells him the cigarette ashes might reveal the truth. Holmes meets the housekeeper in the garden and has a seemingly unimportant chat about the professor's eating habits; apparently he has eaten heavily today. Come the afternoon, the three men return to the professor in his room, and Holmes deliberately knocks the cigarettes over as an excuse to get a closer look at the floor. Holmes' suspicion is confirmed ‚Äì there are footprints in the ash. At that moment the murderer, appearing exactly as Holmes deduced, emerges from a hiding place in a bookcase. The business unfolded thus: The woman came in secret to the professor's house to obtain some documents, using a duplicate key she gained from one of the former secretaries. She was surprised by Smith, whom she attacked with the nearest object to hand, the sealing-wax knife; she had not intended to kill him. She lost her glasses in the scramble to escape; unable to see clearly, she turned along the wrong corridor and wound up in the professor's room. Although surprised, he hid her. The murderer is in fact the professor's estranged wife, Anna, and they are both Russian. Years prior the pair had been involved with Nihilists; she and a non-violent nihilist friend were both betrayed by the professor for gain. Having finished her jail sentence in Siberia, Anna came in search of evidence that would exonerate her friend. Anna committing suicide. Anna had met Smith while he was taking his walk, explaining Smith's last words. The professor's increased appetite is of course explained by his having to feed a second, hidden person. Shortly after the final revelations, Anna dies from poison she took while in hiding. Her last wish is to ask Holmes to deliver the documents to the Russian Embassy, which he duly fulfills.

The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's.Cawthorne (2011), p. 129. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110. Adaptations=Film and television A short silent film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins, Norma Whalley as Anna Coram, and Cecil Morton York as Professor Coram. The television adaptation with Jeremy Brett, in the Granada TV television series Sherlock Holmes, differs slightly. A heavily bearded member of the Russian Brotherhood lurks in the garden, and administers final justice to the villainous Professor. Anna's key was her own original. Dr. Watson is replaced by Sherlock Holmes's brother, Mycroft Holmes, due to the unavailability of Edward Hardwicke for the episode and, instead of Sherlock Holmes dropping cigarette ash on the floor, Mycroft scatters snuff. During Holmes' brother's investigation at the crime scene with Inspector Hopkins, Sherlock Holmes mumbles about the irony that their father gave his magnifying glass to Mycroft who has always been depicted as lazy and lethargic. Also, Mycroft Holmes remarks that their father always told them, \\"eliminate the impossible, and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\\". He then adds, \\"I forget his exact words, but those are near enough.\\" Radio A radio adaptation of the story, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 1 June 1931 in the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 29. Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 12 February 1940.Dickerson (2019), p. 90. Another episode in the same series was adapted from \\"The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\\" by Max Ehrlich, and aired in April 1949 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 271. John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation that aired on NBC radio in April 1955.Dickerson (2019), p. 286. In the radio adaptation (also known as \\"The Yoxley [or Yatsley] Case\\"), Anna kills herself with a pistol rather than by poison. Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a radio adaptation for the BBC Light Programme. It starred Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, and featured Andreas Malandrinos as Professor Coram. The adaptation aired in August 1962. \\"The Golden Pince-Nez\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Peter Ling as part of Bert Coules' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Maurice Denham as Professor Coram and Maureen O'Brien as the Lady. At the end, while in custody, Anna jumps in front of a train, and Holmes remarks that this is how Anna Karenina dies. The story was adapted as a 2010 episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

The current empress consort is Empress Masako, ascending on 1 May 2019. The term can also mean a .  Empress regnant  Empress regnant Jit≈ç (645‚Äì703) by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, c. 1840. There were eight female imperial reigns (six female emperors including two who reigned twice) in Japan's early history between 593 and 770, and two more in the early modern period (Edo period). Although there were eight reigning empresses, with only one exception their successors were selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline.\\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl\\", Japan Times. March 27, 2007. After many centuries, female reigns came to be officially prohibited only when the Imperial Household Law was issued in 1889 alongside the new Meiji Constitution. The eight historical empresses regnant are: * Nukatabe, Empress Suiko (Êé®Âè§Â§©Áöá Suiko Tenn≈ç) was the 33rd empress of Japan from 593 until 628, according to the traditional order of succession, and the first historically attested woman to hold this position. She was the granddaughter of Tashiraga of Yamato, herself sister of the childless Emperor Buretsu, transferring some legitimacy in succession to the throne of Yamato to her husband Emperor Keitai. Tashiraga's mother had been Kasuga of Yamato, sister of the childless Emperor Seinei, whose own marriage with the future Emperor Ninken had a similar effect a generation earlier. According to legends, these ladies descended from the legendary Empress Jing≈´, who had been ruler (since Meiji-era rewrites of history, Regent) of Yamato for decades at some time in the past, probably in the mid-4th century (if she really existed), and who herself descended, according to legends, from Amaterasu omikami, the Sun Goddess of the Japanese pantheon. * Takara, Empress K≈çgyoku (ÁöáÊ•µÂ§©Áöá K≈çgyoku Tenn≈ç), also Empress Saimei (ÊñâÊòéÂ§©Áöá Saimei Tenn≈ç) was the 35th and 37th empress of Japan, initially from February 18, 642, to July 12, 645, ascending upon the death of her uncle Emperor Jomei (who had also been her second husband). When she abdicated, her own younger brother succeeded her. However, upon the death of the said younger brother, she reascended the throne as Empress Saimei on February 14, 655, and ruled until her death on August 24, 661. She was succeeded by her and Emperor Jomei's son, Naka no ≈åe, as Emperor Tenji. * Unonosasara, Empress Jit≈ç (ÊåÅÁµ±Â§©Áöá Jit≈ç Tenn≈ç) was the 41st imperial ruler of Japan, and ruled from 686 until 697. The previous emperor was her uncle and husband, Emperor Tenmu, and she later abdicated the throne to her grandson Emperor Monmu. * Ahe, Empress Genmei (also Empress Genmy≈ç; ÂÖÉÊòéÂ§©Áöá Genmei Tenn≈ç) was the 43rd imperial ruler of Japan ruling 707‚Äì715 (died December 7, 721). She was Empress Jit≈ç's younger half-sister and the mother of Emperor Monmu, who died in an young age. * Hitaka, Empress Gensh≈ç (ÂÖÉÊ≠£Â§©Áöá Gensh≈ç Tenn≈ç) was the 44th monarch of Japan (715‚Äì724). She succeeded after her mother Empress Genmei and later abdicated to her nephew Emperor Sh≈çmu, son of Emperor Monmu. * Abe, Empress K≈çken (Â≠ùË¨ôÂ§©Áöá K≈çken Tenn≈ç) also Empress Sh≈çtoku (Áß∞Âæ≥Â§©Áöá Sh≈çtoku Tenn≈ç) was the 46th imperial ruler of Japan from 749 to 758, and the 48th from 764 to 770. Her posthumous name for her second reign (764‚Äì770) was Empress Sh≈çtoku. She never married and her ex-crown prince was Prince Bunado, her first cousin twice removed, but after her death, another of her cousins ascended the throne as Emperor Kanmu, who was also her brother-in-law. * Okiko, Empress Meish≈ç (ÊòéÊ≠£Â§©Áöá Meish≈ç Tenn≈ç) was the 109th empress of Japan, reigning from December 22, 1629, to November 14, 1643. She ascended upon the abdication of her father, being the eldest surviving child of her parents (the empress, Tokugawa Masako, had only four daughters without surviving sons), holding priority over her younger half- brothers. * Toshiko, Empress Go-Sakuramachi (ÂæåÊ°úÁî∫Â§©Áöá Go-Sakuramachi Tenn≈ç) was the 117th empress of Japan, and ruled from September 15, 1762, to January 9, 1771. She abdicated in favor of her young nephew. Surviving over forty years, the retired Empress held all those decades the position of Dajo Tenno, and acted as sort of guardian of subsequent emperors. Other than the eight historical empresses regnant, two additional empress is traditionally believed to have reigned, but historical evidence for her reign is scant and she is not counted among the officially numbered Emperors: * Empress Jing≈´ r. 206‚Äì269 (Empress Consort of Emperor Ch≈´ai)‚Äînot counted among the officially numbered Emperors *Iitoyo: Imperial princess and possibly empress regnant. She was baptized as Empress Tsunuzashi in the list of emperors of Japan, written by Ernest Mason Satow Under Shinto religious influence, the goddess Amaterasu, who is of the highest rank in the kami system, might suggest that Japan's first rulers were women. According to the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles in Japanese mythology, the Emperors of Japan are considered to be direct descendants of Amaterarasu.  Empress consort  Empress consort Kishi (1303‚Äì1333) and Emperor Go-Daigo (1288‚Äì1339) from Taiheiki Emaki (17th century). Owned by Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore. In ancient Japan, most of the empresses consort were princesses, except for Iwa no hime (empress consort of Nintoku). After Empress K≈çmy≈ç (empress consort of Sh≈çmu), daughters of the Fujiwara clan or other clans could become empresses consort. Originally, Ch≈´g≈´ (‰∏≠ÂÆÆ) referred to the palace of the K≈çg≈ç, K≈çtaig≈ç (ÁöáÂ§™Âêé) (Empress Mother/Empress Dowager), or Tai-K≈çtaig≈ç (Â§™ÁöáÂ§™Âêé) (Grand Empress Mother/Grand Empress Dowager). Until the mid-Heian Period, the emperor had only one empress consort, and the empress consort was also called Ch≈´g≈´. From the time of Emperor Ichij≈ç, when emperors had two empresses consort, one of them came to be called K≈çg≈ç and another one was called Ch≈´g≈´. After maiden Princess Yasuko became K≈çg≈ç as the mother-in-law (ÂáÜÊØç) of Emperor Horikawa, maiden princesses also became K≈çg≈ç. List of non-reigning empresses K≈çg≈ç is the title of a non-reigning empress consort. The title, still in use, is generally conferred on an emperor's wife who had given birth to the heir to the throne.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"K≈çg≈ç\\" in . The title was first awarded posthumously in 806 to the late mother of Emperor Heizei.Ponsonby- Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial Family, p. 318. Ch≈´g≈´ was a term that evolved during the Heian period; and it came to be understood as the title of the empress. For a time, Ch≈´g≈´ replaced K≈çg≈ç; and then the titles became interchangeable.Nussbaum, \\"Ch≈´g≈´\\" at . The numbers of K≈çg≈ç varied, but there was only one Ch≈´g≈´ at a time.Ponsonby-Fane, pp. 300‚Äì302. The title K≈çtaig≈ç was given to the wife of an ex-emperor; and the title Tai-k≈çtaig≈ç came to be used by dowager empresses. * ,Jochi Daigaku. (1989).

It was originally published in The Strand Magazine in 1904 with illustrations by Sidney Paget. Plot Mr. Cyril Overton of Trinity College, Cambridge, comes to Sherlock Holmes seeking his help in Godfrey Staunton's disappearance. Staunton is the key man on Overton's rugby union team (who plays at the three-quarters position, hence the story's title) and they will not win an important match the following day against Oxford if Staunton cannot be found. Holmes has to admit that sport is outside his field, but he shows the same care he has shown to his other cases. Staunton had seemed a bit pale and bothered earlier in the day, but late in the evening, according to a hotel porter, a rough-looking, bearded man came to the hotel with a note for Staunton which, judging from his reaction, contained rather devastating news. He then left the hotel with the bearded stranger and the two of them were seen running in the direction of the Strand at about half past ten. No one has seen them since. Overton has wired to Cambridge to find out if Staunton has been seen there; he has not. He has also wired Lord Mount- James, Staunton's very wealthy uncle and nearest living relative, but has heard no answer. Staunton is the almost-eighty-year-old Lord Mount-James's heir, but he must meanwhile live in relative poverty owing to his uncle's miserly behaviour. Meanwhile, Holmes questions the porter. The bearded man who brought the note was neither a gentleman nor a workman, and he seemed to be bothered by something too, for his hand was trembling as he handed Staunton the note. The only word that the porter overheard of their short conversation was \\"time\\". At six o'clock, the porter had brought Staunton a telegram, and he saw Staunton write a reply. Staunton told the porter that he would send it himself. Holmes looks at the telegraph forms in Staunton's room, and then at the blotter, finally finding a clue. The impression on the blotter yields a part of the message that Staunton sent: \\"Stand by us for God's sake\\". Obviously at least one other person is involved (\\"us\\"), and there is some kind of danger. Other papers left in the room yield clues. Lord Mount-James also briefly visits, but can give Holmes no useful information as to his nephew's whereabouts. The old miser seems utterly aghast at the possibility that it might be a kidnapping whose object would be to extort his wealth. Holmes and Watson then go to the telegraph office where Holmes uses a ruse to get the woman there to show him the counterfoil of the message that Staunton sent. It was addressed to Dr. Leslie Armstrong, a medical academic at Cambridge. They go to see him. Armstrong tells Holmes that Staunton is an intimate friend of his. He does not react when told that Staunton has disappeared, and claims not to know where he is, and not to have seen him recently. He also says that Staunton is very healthy, but Holmes then produces one of Staunton's papers, a thirteen-guinea bill from Armstrong. Furious, Armstrong refuses to answer any more questions, denies that he had the telegram from Staunton, and has his butler show Holmes and Watson out. They lodge at an inn just across the street from Armstrong's office, where they can watch him. Holmes conducts some inquiries. A man in the yard before the inn tells Holmes that Armstrong, although not in actual medical practice, regularly rides in his brougham out into the country somewhere. The round trip seems to take about three hours. Holmes tries following the brougham on one of its outings, hiring a bicycle for the purpose. He is thwarted by Dr. Armstrong, who makes it quite clear that he is aware that Holmes is following him. He gives Holmes the slip. The next day, Holmes's inquiries in all the local villages come to naught; no one has seen the doctor's brougham passing through their village. The mystery is at last unlocked by Pompey, a beagle-foxhound cross by appearance, who tracks the doctor's brougham to a cottage in the countryside after Holmes had coated the wheels in aniseed oil. What Holmes finds is not pleasant. Staunton is there, but is grieving over his young wife, who has just died of consumption. Her existence was kept secret, because Lord Mount-James would not have approved of the marriage and would have disowned his nephew. Armstrong had told the woman's father about her condition, and he, the bearded stranger, had unwisely told Staunton, who felt compelled to rush off forthwith.

Plot Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood. At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 o'clock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate. Sir Eustace's corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wife's dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at his maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstall's account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic. Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from dining room. The half-empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes - the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a \\"multiplex knife\\", not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none. Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready-made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstall's story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins. Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor (indicated by the knots and the active physique) who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide-Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ship's first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the company's new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more. That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news: * As suggested in Holmes' note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind‚Äîa deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place. * The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldn't have committed a murder in Kent the previous night. (l. to r.) Watson, Holmes and Captain Crocker. Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything. Crocker met a woman named Mary (Lady Brackenstall) on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustace's abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self-defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knife's corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond. Holmes tells Crocker that the police don't yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins \\"an excellent hint\\" and doesn't feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the \\"jury\\", and asks him to \\"render a verdict.\\" Watson declares Crocker \\"not guilty.\\" Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.

It dates from about 1125. The chapel was part of the buildings of a leper hospital that stood a little beyond the outskirts of the city on the road to Bury St Edmunds. Parts of the east wall are original, but most of the rest of the chapel was rebuilt in the 13th century, although it still retains many Romanesque features. In 1199 the chapel was given royal dispensation by King John to hold a three-day fair in order to raise money to support the lepers. Starting in 1211, the fair took place around the Feast of the Holy Cross (14 September) on Stourbridge Common which lies a little way behind the chapel and continues down to the River Cam. Stourbridge fair grew to become the largest Medieval fair in Europe and raised so much money that the post of priest at the Leper Chapel became one of the most lucrative jobs in the English church. The job was also a sinecure, since the leper hospital had ceased to admit new lepers in 1279, and what few lepers remained were moved to a new colony near Ely. The chapel had no parish, so there was no need to maintain any religious services. Under legislation of 1546, the chapel was closed and its property assumed by the Crown. Town and University battled over the rights to the Fair until Queen Elizabeth I ruled in favour of the town, reserving the University's rights to control weights, measures and quality of goods. The chapel was thence used only to store the stalls for the next fair and, in the eighteenth century at least, as a pub during the Fair. After 1751, there were no further religious services held at the chapel. In 1783 it was advertised for sale as a storage shed. The fair was abolished in 1933, though it was later revived in the 21st century and is now held annually at the Leper Chapel. In 1816, the Chapel was bought and restored by Thomas Kerrich. Kerrich gave the Chapel to the University, that in turn gave it to the Cambridge Preservation Society in 1951. The chapel is a Grade I listed building and is maintained by Cambridge Past, Present and Future (CPPF). It is again being used for worship and it is now part of the Parish of Christ the Redeemer. The \\"Friends of the Leper Chapel\\" was formed in 1999 to promote use of this chapel for education, cultural events and worship. The chapel also plays host to a range of local cultural activities such as dramatic performances and it is frequently used by the local theatre group In Situ for their performances of Shakespeare.

The first execution of Jews took place just a few days into the occupation. The Germans shot 25 Jewish men in Lenin Park. At the end of July 1941, two ghettos were established in the neighboring village of Ryzhkovichi. In August 1941, the Einsatzgruppen arrived in the town and gathered 84 Jews under the pretext of sending them to forced labor. In fact, they were taken to the village of Semyonovka and were shot in the kolkhoz. In September 1941, the Jews were taken to a ravine in Khoduly, between the villages of Putniki and Zarechye. They had to undress and lie in the ditch before being shot. According to Soviet sources, 3200 Jews were killed in Shklow and the surrounding neighborhood.

He was deposed along with Papadopoulos by junta hardliners in November 1973, and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for high treason in the Greek Junta Trials in 1975. Biography=Early career Angelis was born in the village of Steni on the island of Euboea in 1912. After completing his studies at the Hellenic Army Academy, he was sworn in as an Artillery Second Lieutenant on 2 August 1934. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1937 and Captain in 1940, he participated in the Greco-Italian War as a mountain artillery battery commander. Following the German invasion and the Axis occupation of Greece, in 1943 Angelis fled the country and joined the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East, where he commanded an anti-aircraft battery. After the liberation of Greece he was promoted to Major in 1946, and fought in the Greek Civil War in 1948 and 1949 as an artillery battalion commander. After the end of the civil war, he served in various artillery commands and completed courses at the Superior War School and the National Defence School. He served in the NATO headquarters at Izmir, as aide-de-camp to King Paul, professor at the Superior War School, chief of staff of the 9th Infantry Division, commandant of the Artillery School, Director of the 2nd Staff Bureau at the Hellenic Army General Staff, chief of staff of ASDEN, and deputy commander and commander of the 5th Infantry Division. He was promoted to Lt. Colonel in 1950, Colonel in 1958, Brigadier in 1960, and Major General in 1965. In 1967 he was promoted to Lt. General and Deputy Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff, a post he held at the time of the coup d'etat of 21 April 1967. Under the Junta After the establishment of the military regime, he was appointed Chief of the Army General Staff on 22 April 1967. He was responsible, at least officially, for the Army Decree Nr. 13, which banned the musical works of Mikis Theodorakis. On 21 April 1967 Angelis passed a series of laws limiting protest, including a ban on public gatherings of more than five people, a ban on all private gatherings of a political nature, a ban on propaganda against the generals and a ban on civilians holding guns.Andreas Papandreou, Democracy at Gunpoint: The Greek Front, Penguin Books, 1971, p. 40 During the failed royal counter-coup of 13 December 1967, Angelis remained loyal to the junta, and assumed, in addition to his post as head of the army, the position of Chief of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. On 19 December 1968, he assumed command of the newly formed Armed Forces Headquarters (ŒëœÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒø ŒïŒΩœåœÄŒªœâŒΩ ŒîœÖŒΩŒ¨ŒºŒµœâŒΩ). He was promoted to full General in 1970, and retired from the army on 16 August 1973. Personally loyal to junta principal Georgios Papadopoulos, Angelis was chosen by the latter as his Vice President when he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a Presidential Republic on 1 June 1973. Angelis served in this post until 25 November 1973, when Papadopoulos lost power to a hardliner coup. Trial and imprisonment Following the restoration of democratic rule in 1974, in the 1975 Junta Trials, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for high treason and mutiny. Angelis committed suicide in his cell in the Korydallos Prison on 22 March 1987.

Critias is the second of a projected trilogy of dialogues, preceded by Timaeus and followed by Hermocrates.Eberz (1910). The latter was possibly never written and Critias was left incomplete. Because of their resemblance (e.g. in terms of persons appearing), modern classicists occasionally combine both Timaeus and Critias as Timaeus- Critias.For instance see Welliver (1977) or Calvo/Brisson (1997). Protagonists *Timaeus Unlike the other speakers of the Critias, it is unclear whether Timaeus is a historical figure or not. While some classicists regard him as definitively historical,Kranz (1967), p. 343. others guess that \\"Plato's picture of him has probably borrowed traits from various quarters\\".Thesleff (1982), p. 190. Frank assumes Archytas of Tarentum to be the person which Timaeus is partly based on.Frank (1923), p. 379. On the other hand, F. M. Cornford strongly opposes any idea of a historical Timaeus: \\"The very fact that a man of such distinction left not the faintest trace in political or philosophic history is against his claim to be a historical person. The probability is that Plato invented him because he required a philosopher of the Western School, eminent both in science and statesmanship, and there was no one to fill the post at the imaginary time of the dialogue\\".Cornford (1937), p. 2. But while there is no proof for Timaeus to be historical, there is also no proof that he did not exist, since little is known of the history of the Italian city of Locri. *Critias From the very first comments on Timaeus and Critias in classical antiquityProclus, Commentary on Plato's 'Timaeus', I p.70, 21-24 Diehl = Schol. Plat. Tim. 20a. to the early 20th century,Jowett (1871), p. 526; Wilamowitz-Moellendorf (1919), p. 466. scholars took the identity of this Critias and the oligarch Critias for granted. The first to contradict this view was Burnet in 1914.Burnet (1914), p. 338. Since then, the identity of Critias is fiercely disputed among scholars. One group of classicists still claims him to be the famous oligarch Critias, member of the Thirty Tyrants.Thesleff (1982), p. 189; Bichler (1986), p. 75; Panƒçenko (1990), pp. 135-148; Matt√©i (1996), p. 253; Iannucci (2002), pp. 3-11. Another suggests that this Critias is actually the grandfather of the oligarch.Cornford (1937), p. 1; Welliver (1977), pp. 50-57; David (1984), p. 38; Labarbe (1989/90); Morgan (1998), p. 101. The latter group argues that there is too much distance of time between the oligarch Critias (460‚Äì403 BC) and Solon (638‚Äì558 BC), the famous lawmaker, who supposedly brought the Atlantis story from Egypt to Greece.Timaeus 23e. According to Plato, Solon told the story to the great-grandfather of the Critias appearing in this dialogue, Dropides, who then told it to his son, who was also named Critias and the grandfather of the Critias in the dialogue. The elder Critias then retold the story to his grandson when he was 90 and the younger Critias was 10.Timaeus 20d-23. The latter group alleges that the tyrant's grandfather could not have both talked to Solon and still have been alive at the time the hypothetical discussion pictured in this dialogue was held. Thus they assume that it is the tyrant's grandfather who appears in both Timaeus and Critias, and his own grandfather, who was told the Atlantis story by Solon. On the other hand, this obviously too long time span between Solon and Critias would not be the only anachronism in Plato's work. In fact, Plato produced quite a number of anachronisms in many of his dialogues.Zeller, E. (1873). √úber die Anachronismen in den platonischen Gespr√§chen, Berlin: Akademie der Wissenschaften, pp. 79-99. And further, there are indications that Solon was dated later than when he actually lived by writers prior to Aristotle.Fehling, D. (1985). Die sieben Weisen und die fr√ºhgriechische Chronologie, Bern, pp. 111-112. This leads one to believe that Plato somewhat telescoped the happenings of the sixth century. For his purposes, Solon lived just before Anacreon, and Anacreon in turn was active in the early fifth century.Rosenmeyer (1949), p. 408. The elder Critias is unknown to have achieved any personal distinction, and since he died long before Plato published the Timaeus and Critias, it would have made no sense for Plato to choose a statesman to appear in these dialogues, who was practically unknown and thus uninteresting to his contemporaries.Panƒçenko (1990), p. 137. *Socrates The speaker Socrates is, of course, identical with the well-known Athenian philosopher. *Hermocrates Hermocrates is almost certainly the Syracusan politician and general who is also mentioned by Thucydides among others. He has the smallest share of the conversation in this dialogue. \\"Since the dialogue that was to bear his name was never written, we can only guess why Plato chose him. It is curious to reflect that, while Critias is to recount how the prehistoric Athens of nine thousand years ago had repelled the invasion from Atlantis and saved the Mediterranean peoples from slavery, Hermocrates would be remembered by the Athenians as the man who had repulsed their own greatest effort at imperialist expansion.\\" However, there has been criticism concerning the identification of Hermocrates in the dialogues with the historical Hermocrates of Syracuse. German classicist Eberz has argued that it is actually Dion of Syracuse, who explains the polity of Hermocrates in his name.Eberz (1910), p. 43. Content Plato's Atlantis described in Timaeus and Critias. According to Critias, in ancient times, the Earth was divided among the gods by allotment. The gods treated the humans in their districts much as shepherds treat sheep, tending and guiding them like nurselings and possessions. They did this not by force, but by persuasion. In those days, the areas which are now the islands of Greece were high hills covered in good soil. A number of great deluges came (including the global flood of Deucalion), and because no soil washed down from the mountains to replace the lost soil, the soil in that land was stripped away, causing much of the area to sink out of sight, and the islands that remained to become the \\"bones of a dead body.\\" Athens, in those days, was very different. The land was rich and water was brought in from underground springs (which were later destroyed by earthquake). He describes the civilization of Athens at that time as ideal: pursuing all virtue, living in moderation, and excelling in their work. He then moves on to describe the origins of Atlantis. He said that Atlantis was allotted to Poseidon. Poseidon fell in love with a mortal girl named Cleito (daughter of Evenor and Leucippe), and she bore him a number of children, the first of which was named Atlas, who inherited the kingdom and passed it onto his firstborn for many generations. Critias then goes into a great deal of detail in describing the island of Atlantis and the Temple to Poseidon and Cleito on the island, and refers to the legendary metal orichalcum. Critias then reiterates the remarkable virtue of the Atlanteans, saying: :\\"For many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the laws, and well-affectioned towards the god, whose seed they were; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits, uniting gentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life, and in their intercourse with one another. They despised everything but virtue, caring little for their present state of life, and thinking lightly of the possession of gold and other property, which seemed only a burden to them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control; but they were sober, and saw clearly that all these goods are increased by virtue and friendship with one another, whereas by too great regard and respect for them, they are lost and friendship with them.\\" However, the Atlanteans became corrupt as: :\\"...when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the upper hand, they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased, for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts; but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness, they appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power.\\" Critias then says that Zeus, the god of gods, seeing the corruption of the Atlanteans, determined to chastise them. Zeus begins to speak; but what he says, and everything that follows in the Critias, remains non extant.

Sadras is the anglicised form of the ancient town of Saduranga pattinam. History and Etymology An inscription found in Sadras dated to 1359 mention this place as Rajanarayanan Pattinam after a Sambuvaraya chieftain. There is a temple to Vishnu here, and because of it later the city was known as Sadiravasagan Pattinam. This later changed into Sadurangapattinam, shortly known as Sadirai. Later the Dutch called it Sadras. Dutch Fort Entrance of Sadras fort Modern Sadras was established as part of Dutch Coromandel in the seventeenth century, which was even before center for weaving superfine muslin cloth for export besides Pearl and edible oil. The magnificent Sadras Fort, built for commercial purposes by the Dutch, is a vast compound enclosing a huge granary, stable and structures used to mount elephants; unfortunately only one of these structures survives. The fortress was raided by the British in 1818 and came under the control of the British East India Company. It is now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India in efforts to contain further dilapidation of this great monument. From 2003 major restoration of the damaged fort was carried out leading to may archaeological findings. The first battle between British East India Company and the Dutch started here as Battle of Sadras. The fort includes a cemetery with many beautifully decorated graves that date to between 1620 and 1769. A Tomb inside the fort with Coat of Arms Location In recent times, Sadras has found mention due to its proximity to the atomic power plant (Madras Atomic Power Station) and the atomic research centre (Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research ‚Äì IGCAR) both located at nearby Kalpakkam.

One of eight stories in the volume His Last Bow, it is a lengthy, two-part story consisting of \\"The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles\\" and \\"The Tiger of San Pedro\\", which on original publication in The Strand bore the collective title of \\"A Reminiscence of Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\". Synopsis=The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles Eccles, Holmes and Inspector Baynes. Holmes is visited by a perturbed proper English gentleman, John Scott Eccles, who wishes to discuss something \\"grotesque\\". No sooner has he arrived at 221B Baker Street than Inspector Gregson also shows up, along with Inspector Baynes of the Surrey Constabulary. They wish a statement from Eccles about the murder near Esher last night. A note in the dead man's pocket indicates that Eccles said that he would be at the victim's house that night. Eccles is shocked to hear of Aloysius Garcia's beating death. Yes, he spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia's rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared. He was alone in an empty house. He last remembers seeing Garcia at about one o'clock in the morning when he came to Eccles's room to ask if he had rung. Eccles met Garcia, a Spaniard, through an acquaintance, and seemed to form an unlikely friendship right away. Garcia invited Eccles to stay at his house for a few days, but when Eccles arrived there, he could tell that something was amiss. Garcia seemed distracted by something, and the whole mood of the visit seemed quite sombre. Indeed, Garcia's mood became even darker once his servant handed him a note that evening. Eccles left Wisteria Lodge and inquired about the place at the estate agent's, and was surprised to find that the rent on the house had been paid in full. Odder still, no-one at the Spanish Embassy in London had heard of Garcia. Inspector Baynes produces the note that Eccles saw Garcia receive. It reads \\"Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D.\\", in a woman's handwriting. Could it have been a tryst? Could a jealous husband be behind Garcia's death? It emerges that Baynes has deduced that Garcia's body had been lying out in the open since one o'clock, but Eccles says that this is impossible, as Garcia came to his room about then. Holmes theorizes that Garcia may have tampered with the clocks to get Eccles to bed earlier than he thought it was, and that the whole business of coming to his room and making a point of mentioning that it was one o'clock--when it was probably much earlier --was likely aimed at setting up an alibi, but for what? All that Holmes can deduce is that the murderer lives near Wisteria Lodge, and in a big house. The Tiger of San Pedro Murillo confining Miss Burnet. Holmes and Dr. Watson go to Esher to see Wisteria Lodge with Inspector Baynes. The constable guarding the house reports a hair-raising experience. A brutish-looking man-- the devil himself, thought the constable--looked in the window. The constable gave chase, but the intruder got away. Holmes establishes by the footmarks that the constable did not imagine this. Inside the house, a number of odd items are to be seen: something resembling a mummified baby, a bird torn to pieces, a pail of blood, and a platter full of charred bones. Holmes later links these to voodoo, providing an important clue. Suddenly, however, five days after the murder, Holmes is astonished to read in the newspaper that Baynes has arrested someone, Garcia's cook, the brutish fellow who had given the constable such a start. He provides little information, though--only grunts. Holmes is sure that the cook is not the murderer, and warns Baynes. Baynes, however, declines Holmes's assistance and advice. Holmes spends the next day reconnoitering the local country houses, and finds one of interest, the Henderson household, whose master has obviously spent time in the tropics, and whose secretary, Lucas, is a dark-skinned foreigner. Mr. Henderson's two girls have an English governess named Burnet. Holmes also learns from a sacked gardener that Henderson is rich and scared of something, although no one can say what. Nor can anyone say where he came from. Henderson is also violent. Holmes believes that the cryptic note came from this household, High Gable, and the writer could only be Miss Burnet, who has not been seen since the night of the murder. Holmes decides to go to High Gable, at night, to see whether he can \\"strike at the very heart of the mystery.\\" He does not get the chance. John Warner, the sacked gardener, comes in and announces that the Hendersons have fled by train, and tried to take Miss Burnet with them. He, however, wrestled her into a cab and brought her to the inn where Holmes and Watson are staying. She was obviously unwilling to go with Henderson for she had been drugged with opium. \\"Henderson\\" has also been identified, by Inspector Baynes. He is Don Juan Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro, a hated and feared overthrown dictator from Central America. It turns out that Garcia, who was from San Pedro, not Spain, got himself killed in a revenge plot. Miss Burnet was also part of the plot. Yes, she wrote the note, but Murillo's secretary caught her doing it, Murillo confined her, and then awaited Garcia's move, killing him. Miss Burnet's real name is Mrs. Victor Durando. Her late husband was from San Pedro, its ambassador to Britain and a potential political rival to Murillo. Murillo had him recalled and shot so that he could not pose a threat to Murillo's position. Murillo and his companions give the police the slip in London, and resurface in Madrid under new aliases. However, they are both murdered, and their killers are never caught. Commentary Out of the entire collection of Holmes stories by Doyle, this is the only story in which a police inspector (specifically, Inspector Baynes) is as competent as Holmes. Holmes has nothing but praise for Inspector Baynes, believing that he will rise high in his profession, for he has instinct and intuition. Inspector Lestrade rarely received this kind of appreciation from Holmes. It comes out that Baynes had only arrested the cook to draw out Henderson so he would think he was no longer under suspicion. San Pedro is a fictitious country; its colours are green and white, explaining one part of the cryptic note. Publication history \\"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\\" was first published in the US in Collier's on 15 August 1908, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September‚ÄìOctober 1908. In the Strand, the story was published in two parts: \\"The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles\\" and \\"The Tiger of San Pedro\\".Smith (2014), p. 165.

Adaptations=Film and television *A short silent film titled The Tiger of San Pedro (1921) was based on the story. It was one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, and starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. *The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. *The Granada TV adaption with Jeremy Brett followed the original story with a few exceptions. There is no mention of any of the voodoo relics in Wisteria Lodge, and it is Watson who gives chase to the cook, not the constable. Also, at the end, \\"The Tiger of San Pedro\\" and his accomplice are not killed in a Madrid hotel, but instead by Garcia's surviving compatriots on a train while Murillo is fleeing to escape Holmes and the law. *In the NHK puppet show Sherlock Holmes, it is Gordon Lestrade, a member of the life guidance committee of Beeton School who has a \\"singular\\" experience.

MAPS was founded in 1986 by Rick Doblin, and is now based in Santa Cruz, California. MAPS helps scientists design, fund, and obtain regulatory approval for studies of the safety and effectiveness of a number of controlled substances. MAPS works closely with government regulatory authorities worldwide such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to ensure that all of its sponsored research protocols conform to ethical and procedural guidelines for clinical drug research. Included in MAPS' research efforts are MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); LSD and psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, cluster headaches, and depression associated with end-of-life issues; ibogaine for the treatment of opiate addiction, ayahuasca for the treatment of drug addiction and PTSD; medical cannabis for PTSD; and alternative delivery systems for medical cannabis such as vaporizers and water pipes. MAPS officials say the organization's ultimate goal is to establish a network of clinics where these and other treatments can be provided together with other therapies under the guidance of trained, licensed physicians and therapists. In addition to sponsoring scientific research, MAPS organizes continuing medical education (CME) conferences, sponsors and presents lectures and seminars on the state of psychedelic and medical marijuana research, provides psychedelic harm reduction services through the Zendo Project at events such as music festivals and Burning Man, and publishes a triannual magazine-style publication, the MAPS Bulletin, with updates about its ongoing research efforts, legal struggles, and educational initiatives. MAPS also publishes books dealing with the science, history, and culture of psychedelic research and psychedelic therapy.  History = Psychedelic therapy  The psychoactive properties of LSD were discovered in 1943 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann when he accidentally ingested a small dose through the skin while studying the compound. Controlled research on human subjects began soon after and Hofmann's colleague Werner Stoll published his findings about the basic effects of LSD on human subjects in 1947. After the earliest European and American research efforts investigated whether LSD could reliably induce psychotic disorders, some began to evaluate the potential for LSD to assist in traditional Freudian psychotherapy in the 1950s. Studies into the effects of LSD on human creativity and spirituality were also conducted during this period. One notable researcher was Humphry Osmond whose team treated mental patients in the Weyburn Mental Hospital in Saskatchewan with psychedelics, which he thought gave insight into the way psychotic people see the world, but later realized they had a wider potential. In Weyburn, Osmond coined the term psychedelic meaning 'soul manifesting'. The first use of the word may have been in a poem Osmond wrote, which had the lines ‚ÄúTo fathom Hell or go angelic / just take a pinch of psychedelic.‚Äù. The writer Aldous Huxley became interested in the Canadian research and Osmond subsequently gave Huxley a dose of mescaline.Pollan, Michael 2018 How To Change Your Mind, Penguin Random House, The resulting experience led Huxley to write The Doors of Perception, stimulating widespread interest in psychedelics. (The rock band The Doors was named after the book and its titular quotation from William Blake). Osmond's work was followed by protocols for the use of psychedelics by mavericks like Al Hubbard who advocated the potential of LSD as a transcendental substance. Research in Saskatchewan, Toronto and elsewhere demonstrated impressive success in treating alcoholism. The next major development in the history of psychedelic research was the rediscovery of psilocybin by Western society due to the appearance of an article in a 1957 issue of Life magazine written by R. Gordon Wasson detailing his experiences ingesting psilocybin mushrooms in a shamanic ceremony in Mexico. European studies into the use of psilocybin as a psychotherapeutic agent (Duche; Delay et al.) were published as early as 1961. An article by Pichot about the basic effects of psilocybin on 137 normal and unhealthy subjects appeared in the medical journal Lancet in the same year. In the early 1960s, Harvard University was the seat of two experiments involving psilocybin. The first of these was the Concord Prison Experiment which began in 1961 under the supervision of principal researchers Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if psilocybin- assisted psychotherapeutic techniques could permanently reverse the criminal and anti-social tendencies of 32 state prisoners nearing parole and prevent them from being incarcerated again. Leary's team combined the administration of synthetic psilocybin in guided sessions with a variety of tests and support sessions during and after release.Hallucinogen use predicts reduced recidivism among substance-involved offenders under community corrections supervision J Psychopharmacol January 2014 vol. 28 no. 1 62-66. The next Harvard experiment with crucial implications for the development of psychedelic research was Walter Pahnke's Good Friday Experiment of 1962. Pahnke set out to determine if psilocybin could be used to facilitate \\"mystical\\" experiences and if these experiences could cause permanent and beneficial personality transformation. In order to do so, he recruited 20 Protestant divinity students, 10 of whom would take synthetic psilocybin and 10 of whom would take a placebo. The experiment took place in a basement chapel in which the audio from a Good Friday service conducted in the main chapel upstairs was broadcast. Throughout the short history of LSD research, people unaffiliated or loosely affiliated with the scientific establishment distributed supplies of LSD outside of laboratory settings. Soon the lines between legitimate research and personal experimentation began to blur for some, and as early as 1962 fellow faculty members at Harvard openly criticized Leary and Alpert for abandoning scientific principles and experimenting with LSD outside official research settings. A few months later the university would dismiss both professors for violating university regulations by providing LSD to undergraduates. The controversy at Harvard coincided with greatly increased FDA restrictions on the procurement of LSD for scientific research; although some research did continue, most studies underway before the new FDA restrictions did not. After restricting its manufacture and distribution in 1965, the US government fully criminalized LSD in 1968, after which the European nations which hosted psychedelic research followed suit. In the United States, legal psychedelic research was reduced to only one program ‚Äì the studies conducted at the Spring Grove Center in Baltimore which primarily focused on end of life therapy and continued through to 1974. The study, which eventually came to be headed by Pahnke and Grof, resulted in the treatment of over 100 terminal patients, including 31 in a controlled LSD psychotherapy study. Throughout the 1980s, MDMA was administered in psychiatric and counseling settings, but recreational use also became increasingly widespread. MDMA research was mostly halted in 1985 by the United States government's initiation of proceedings to ensure temporary classification of the compound as a Schedule I drug (a classification made permanent in 1988). As psychedelics gained increasing recognition as potential psychotherapeutic agents, so too were they recognized within popular culture for their recreational use.  Founding MAPS  Anticipating that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) would move to criminalize MDMA in light of the drug's increasing popularity in recreational use, Rick Doblin, Alise Agar and Debby Harlow organized a nonprofit group called Earth Metabolic Design Laboratories (EMDL) to advocate for the potential therapeutic use of MDMA. By 1984 the DEA had announced its intention to designate MDMA as a Schedule I substance, a categorization that would greatly restrict and regulate the drug's availability, as well as indicate that it held no accepted medical use and a high abuse potential. EMDL organized supporters to petition the DEA for a scheduling hearing regarding MDMA. Dr. George Greer, Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Professor James Bakalar, and Professor Thomas Roberts contributed to the argument that MDMA belonged in Schedule III, a category that would more readily enable future research and permit the continuation of its use in psychotherapy. Despite such efforts, the DEA pursued emergency scheduling in 1985, citing an imminent risk to public health. As MDMA was now deemed illegal, held in the same category as such substances as heroin, the only way for it to be employed in scientific inquiry would be through the lengthy and expensive FDA approval process. Holding the belief that MDMA had the unique potential both to aid psychotherapy and eventually to become a prescription medicine, Rick Doblin sought to gain incorporation for MAPS as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research and educational organization. The founding of MAPS was a primary step toward the future envisioning of what Doblin has called a \\"nonprofit psychedelic-pharmaceutical company.\\" Chartered in 1986, MAPS has since contributed over 12 million dollars towards the scientific study of psychedelics and cannabis in therapeutic applications.  Projects  Since 1986, MAPS has distributed over $20 million to fund psychedelics and medical cannabis research and education. These include: * Erowid and MAPS have been collaborating on two large reference database projects since 2001. Erowid has been providing expertise and work developing and coordinating construction of an online MDMA Reference library and MAPS begun working on doing a similar project with the Albert Hofmann Foundation's LSD and Psilocybin Library. * Designed a study to examine vaporized or smoked marijuana in the treatment of war related PTSD in veterans, which will evaluate efficacy and safety of multiple strains of herbal cannabis. The study has received FDA approval. MAPS is pursuing the purchase of appropriate strains from the US federal government. * Sponsored efforts by Prof. Lyle Craker, Medicinal Plant Program, UMass Amherst Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, to obtain a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration for a marijuana production facility. * Sponsored analytical research into the effects of the marijuana vaporizer, leading to the first human study of marijuana vaporizers conducted by Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California, San Francisco. * Funded the successful efforts of Dr. Donald Abrams to obtain approval for the first human study in 15 years into the therapeutic use of marijuana, along with a $1 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. * Obtained Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for smoked marijuana in the treatment of AIDS Wasting Syndrome. * Supported long-term follow-up studies of pioneering research with LSD and psilocybin originally conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. * Sponsoring research by Dr. Evgeny Krupitsky into ketamine-assisted psychotherapy as a potential treatment for heroin addiction and alcoholism. * Sponsoring programs and services at festivals, community events, churches, and schools that provide psychedelic harm reduction and education. * A clinical study evaluating the treatment of cluster headaches using low doses of the tryptamine psilocybin (found in psilocybin mushrooms) is being developed by researchers at Harvard Medical School, McLean Hospital in conjunction with MAPS. * Performed several small clinical studies described below, and in some cases, published the results in scientific journals.  Organization = Board and staff  MAPS is governed by a board of directors including John Gilmore, David Bronner, Robert J. Barnhart, and Rick Doblin. Ashawna Hailey served on the board until her death in 2011.  Funding  MAPS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) research and educational organization, funded by donations from individuals and foundations.MAPS Bulletin Volume XX, 3, \\"2010 Annual Report\\" Donations to MAPS can be restricted to fund a specific project, or be unrestricted. MAPS also receives revenue from conferences and events, such as the Psychedelic Science conference, as well as from the sale of books, merchandise, and art.MAPS Annual Financial Report, Fiscal Year 2009-2010 June 1, 2009 - May 31, 2010 With a policy of transparency in financial matters, MAPS publishes a detailed annual financial report. On August 20, 2020, having raised $30 million in non-profit donations in less than six months, MAPS and the Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative (PSFC) announced the completion of the Capstone Campaign, a non-profit fundraising effort to fund the final research required to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Research = MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD  MAPS has a primary focus in researching the effectiveness of using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to assist psychotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MAPS is the only organization in the world funding clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, as it is of little interest to commercial pharmaceutical companies. Ultimately, MAPS seeks to achieve FDA approval for the use of MDMA as a prescription medicine. MAPS completed a US Pilot Study in September 2008 that investigated the effectiveness of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which took place in Charleston, South Carolina. The study sought to determine whether MDMA- assisted psychotherapy would be effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in 20 subjects identified with treatment-resistant PTSD resulting from sexual abuse, war, violent crime, and other traumas. MAPS is conducting a phase 2 pilot study to assess the effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD among veterans of war. The study is taking place in Charleston, SC and is conducting experimental treatment with 16 veterans, both male and female, suffering war-related PTSD. The study will follow a randomized triple-blind protocol and test three different experimental doses. Outside of the US, MAPS is pursuing the implementation of MDMA/PTSD studies in Canada, Israel, Jordan, and Switzerland. The Canadian study has full approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and from Health Canada, and is waiting to obtain an import permit to import MDMA into Canada. The Israel Study is awaiting approval from the Israeli Institutional Review Board as well as the Ministry of Health before it can proceed with enrollment.. An Israeli Defense Force official has indicated a willingness to refer war affected soldiers suffering from PTSD, thus greatly enabling recruitment for the study. The Jordan Study is in development with limited approval from the IRB. A protocol amendment is to be submitted in the near future. MAPS is seeking to enroll both Jordanian nationals as well as Iraqi refugees living in Jordan who are suffering from PTSD. The Switzerland study has received full approval from SwissMedic and has been submitted and accepted by the FDA in the form of an Investigational New Drug application. The study is in progress and nearing completion as MAPS is collecting long-term follow-up data following the experimental treatment of all 12 subjects. The study represents in part MAPS' clinical plan to develop MDMA as a prescription medication with both FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approval. MAPS has developed a training protocol that will allow therapists to take part as subjects in a Phase 1 study on the psychological effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy on healthy volunteers. MAPS would thus administer one MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session to the therapists in an effort to offer them training as well as evaluate the effects of MDMA. The study has received approval to proceed by both the US FDA and the IRB. Mithoefer, the primary clinical investigator in this study, has received his Schedule 1 license from the DEA, enabling him to administer MDMA within this study.  LSD and psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for end-of- life anxiety  It is well evidenced that psychoactive mushrooms and a number of other plants containing psychoactive compounds have been valued for millennia by many indigenous tribes across the globe for their spiritual & therapeutic uses. An explosion of recreational use during the 1960s gained LSD and Psilocybin a great deal of notoriety and ultimately led to their categorization as Schedule I illicit drugs in 1970. MAPS is committed to exploring the potential use of LSD and psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of patients suffering with the deep anxiety associated with life-threatening illness. Developing new research protocols to meet modern drug development standards, MAPS' pilot LSD and psilocybin studies will be used to guide development of future treatment methodologies. MAPS is conducting a study on LSD-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of anxiety secondary to life-threatening illness. The study is taking place in Solothurn, Switzerland, and is the first study in 35 years to investigate the therapeutic use of LSD in human subjects. The study's primary focus is to assess the safety and effectiveness of conducting LSD-assisted psychotherapy with a population of individuals who are experiencing anxiety associated with life- threatening illness. The study has received approval from the BAG (the equivalent of the DEA in Switzerland), the Ethics Committee (the Swiss IRB), and SwissMedic. Enrolment began in April 2008 and is now complete. MAPS has also developed a protocol to study the effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating anxiety related to the experience of having a life- threatening illness such as advanced stage cancer. This study is to be conducted in the US under the principal investigation of Sameet Kumar, Ph.D.  Ibogaine treatment for drug addiction  MAPS is collecting observational data from two ibogaine treatment centers in Mexico to study the long-term effects of Ibogaine treatment on opiate-dependent subjects. MAPS has released a request for proposals (RFP) to find a research team interested in conducting clinical trials on ibogaine; a $25,000 grant has been made available to help fund such a study.  Medical marijuana  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) holds a monopoly on the supply of marijuana grown for research in the United States, as they fund the only laboratory licensed to grow it. Since NIDA is solely interested in researching the negative aspects of marijuana use and abuse, studies to explore its potential medical benefit are impossible within the US. MAPS is the only organization working to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of botanical marijuana as a prescription medicine to the satisfaction of the FDA. For nearly ten years, MAPS has been involved in lengthy and ongoing legal battles with the DEA to end NIDA's monopoly on research grade marijuana. Alternatively, MAPS has received full approval from the FDA to study the effectiveness of marijuana, both smoked and vaporized, in the treatment of individuals experiencing war related PTSD. This marks the first time the FDA has approved an outpatient marijuana study.  Educational outreach = MAPS bulletin  The MAPS Bulletin (called the MAPS Newsletter before 1995) is the organization's official publication. It provides summaries of psychedelic research conducted under the auspices of the organization and other worldwide research efforts in addition to discussions of psychedelic culture, personal reflections on psychedelic experiences, writings from leading figures in the psychedelic research community, as well as psychedelic art.  Psychedelic harm reduction  MAPS offers educational resources that actively promote psychedelic harm reduction. Psychedelic harm reduction is an approach to minimize harmful consequences and risks associated with the therapeutic and recreational use of psychedelic drugs. A harm reduction approach is an alternative to drug prohibition laws that criminalize users of psychedelic substances. Inexperienced or overwhelmed users of psychedelics sometimes have challenging emotional experiences that are resolved through law enforcement or medical intervention, which may lead to psychological damage long after the trip is over. A harm reduction approach to using psychedelics often includes attention to set and setting, a trip sitter, or framing in the context of psychedelic therapy. MAPS has provided psychedelic emergency services at festivals such as Hookahville, Burning Man and the Boom Festival. MAPS' model of psychedelic emergency services is volunteer staffed, peer based and relies on acute intervention. MAPS also provides training and an educational video, which empowers psychedelic users and their peers with therapeutic techniques for use in assisting others through difficult psychedelic experiences. MAPS' approach to psychedelic harm reduction encourages a new framework for looking at \\"bad\\" trips as opportunities for emotional and spiritual growth. Additionally, MAPS co- sponsors EcstasyData.org, an online resource that provides laboratory testing of ecstasy tablets for a minimal cost, which allows users to know exactly what they are ingesting and to avoid taking mislabeled or impure substances. MAPS has also formed a partnership with Bluelight, a web forum dedicated to harm reduction.

In the past, the institute has refused to supply marijuana to researchers who had obtained all other necessary federal permits. Medical marijuana researchers and activists claim that NIDA, which is not supposed to be a regulatory organization, does not have the authority to effectively regulate who does and doesn't get to do research with medical marijuana. Jag Davies of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) writes in MAPS Bulletin: NIDA administers a contract with the University of Mississippi to grow the nation's only legal cannabis crop for medical and research purposes, including the Compassionate Investigational New Drug program. United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. Medical marijuana researchers typically prefer to use high-potency marijuana, but NIDA's National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse has been reluctant to provide cannabis with high THC levels, citing safety concerns: Major events in recent proceedings are notable, as in the 2007 ruling by Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner, wherein she recommended that Craker receive a license to grow marijuana for research and that NIDA dismantle its monopoly. The DEA in response overturned the recommended ruling in January 2009, and later denied Craker's Motion to Reconsider in December 2010. In March 2011, Craker's lawyers submitted their final brief in the case. MAPS is pursuing efforts to have the DEA's final ruling rescinded. A detailed timeline of MAPS' attempts to gain access to research grade marijuana is available on the MAPS website.

It is included in the anthology His Last Bow. Synopsis Mrs. Warren, a landlady, comes to 221B Baker Street with some questions about her lodger. A youngish, heavily bearded man, who spoke good but accented English who came to her and offered double her usual rent on the condition that he get the room on his own terms. He went out the first night that he was there, and came back after midnight when the rest of the household had gone to bed. Since then, neither Mrs. Warren, her husband, nor their servant girl has seen him. The lodger insisted on having the Daily Gazette every morning, and sometimes requested other things. All requests were printed on a slip of paper left on a chair outside the room where meals were also left. Mrs. Warren has brought some spent matches and a cigarette end from her lodger, hoping that Holmes can read something from them. It is clear that the cigarette has been smoked without a holder, which is quite unusual for a man with whiskers. He also eats very little, and never receives visitors or messages. After the landlady leaves, Holmes remarks to Dr. Watson that it seems likely that the person in Mrs. Warren's house is not the bearded man who made the arrangements. The evidence lies not only in the cigarette, but in the fact that the lodger's knowledge of English is not as good as the bearded man's (he wrote MATCH as one of his requests, for instance, not MATCHES). His \\"return\\" on the first night was very late so that no-one would see him and he has taken great pains to ensure no-one has seen him since. Holmes suspects that messages are being sent to the lodger, perhaps in the Daily Gazette's agony column. He finds them: \\"Will find some sure means of communication. Meanwhile, this column. G.\\" (posted only two days after the lodger's arrival), \\"Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.\\" (three days later), and \\"The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed-one A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.\\" (yesterday). Holmes needs only wait one day for a very useful message: \\"High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G.\\" Holmes decides that it is time to reconnoitre Mrs. Warren's neighbourhood. Just then, Mrs. Warren arrives complaining that her husband was kidnapped that morning and taken by cab to Hampstead Heath where he was unceremoniously cast onto the roadway. He never got a clear look at his kidnappers or their cab. Holmes realizes that the ruffians mistook Mr. Warren for the lodger, and dumped him after they realized their mistake. Holmes and Watson go to Mrs. Warren's house just before lunchtime, hoping to catch a glimpse of the lodger as he takes his lunch from the chair. Before going in, Holmes observes that the lodger's window commands a good view down Howe Street, and at the other end is a house matching the one mentioned in the agony column. In Mrs. Warren's house, Holmes and Watson hide in a boxroom. By using a mirror they see the lodger retrieve the lunch tray from the hall, discovering that the lodger is a comely-featured young woman with a dark complexion. They realize that she has been carefully printing (rather than writing in common handwriting) her requests to hide her gender. It is equally clear that she and her bearded confederate, likely a lover or husband, are in some kind of danger and seeking refuge. From the lodger's horror at suspecting a trick at lunchtime, and the exceptional precautions that have been taken to ensure secrecy, it must be a matter of life and death. That evening, Holmes and Watson are on hand to see the lodger's confederate's lantern-signals, sent by a waving candle. The first message says \\"Attenta, attenta, attenta!\\" (Beware, beware, beware!). It becomes clear that they are Italian, and from the \\"-a\\" ending that the message is meant for a woman. The signaller then flashes \\"Pericolo\\" (\\"Danger\\") and then \\"Peri-\\". Realizing that the signaller has been interrupted, Holmes and Watson rush to the house and are surprised to meet Inspector Gregson and a Pinkerton detective from the United States named Leverton (described by Holmes as \\"the hero of the Long Island cave mystery\\"). They are lying in wait for Giuseppe Gorgiano, a vicious killer of whose infamy Holmes is well aware. The house has only one door and they know that he is inside. Gregson and Leverton have been unaware of the signalled messages. Gregson says that three men have come out of the house, but none was Gorgiano, who is a giant. One, however, matched the description of the man who made the arrangements at Mrs. Warren's. Going into the house and to the room where the signalling came from, Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Leverton discover a grisly scene. The giant Gorgiano has been killed, apparently in a fight. The bearded man is undoubtedly the killer. The lady's arriving at the door shortly afterward is a surprise to everyone but Holmes, who had impersonated the lady's confederate by re-lighting the same candle that her confederate had used, and signalling in Italian for her to come. Her name is Emilia Lucca, and her confederate is Gennaro, her husband. The men are rather taken aback by her obvious joy at this ghastly sight. She confirms that the Luccas were seeking refuge from the dangerous Giuseppe Gorgiano, who was out to kill Gennaro for betraying the Red Circle, a secret criminal organization that Gennaro had got himself involved in as an angry young man. Gennaro had never actually participated in any of the society's crimes, however, and eventually decided to leave the organization in spite of the threatened consequences. He and his wife fled Italy and went to New York to escape the Red Circle, but Gorgiano, another member, discovered Gennaro there, and contrived to oblige him to murder a good friend, a man who had gotten Gennaro started in legitimate business in the US. Gennaro had no intention of doing such a thing, and even warned his friend of the Red Circle's orders. The police were also informed. The Luccas then fled to England where Gorgiano tracked Gennaro down, intending to kill Gennaro and abduct the lovely Emilia, to whom he had developed a lustful attraction. Gorgiano died in the ensuing fight, however. Gregson feels compelled to take Emilia down to the police station, and the same fate probably awaits Gennaro, but as their actions had been purely in self-defense, it seems likely that there will be no charges. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Red Circle\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March‚ÄìApril 1911, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in April‚ÄìMay 1911.Smith (2014), p. 177. The story was published with three illustrations by H. M. Brock and one by Joseph Simpson in The Strand Magazine, and with the same illustrations in the US edition of the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 141. It was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151.  Adaptations =Film and television The story was adapted as a short silent film in 1922. It was one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, and starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. The 1945 film Pursuit to Algiers sources some of its characters from this story. The 1994 Granada TV series adaptation (entitled merely \\"The Red Circle\\") makes several key modifications to the short story: The episode introduces a new character (Enrico Formani, an Italian expatriate who is murdered by Gorgiano, possibly indirectly as a result of Watson blowing Formani's cover). Inspector Gregson is replaced by Inspector Hawkins. Gorgiano makes an attempt to infiltrate the Warrens' house and kidnap Emilia. He is chased away by Leverton. Emilia notices Holmes and Watson in the boxroom, realizes she has been seen and quickly locks her door. With coaxing and explanations by Holmes, the frightened woman hesitantly unlocks the door. Holmes enters Emilia's room and speaks with her, hearing the story of how she and her husband ended up involved with the Red Circle. Emilia arrives at the scene of the fight between Gorgiano and Gennaro before Holmes and his party do. Radio \\"The Adventure of the Red Circle\\" was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired on 15 October 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 39. Another production of the story aired in February 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 62. The story was also adapted for The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.Dickerson (2019), p. 103. The radio adaptation, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, was titled \\"Mrs. Warren's Lodger\\" and aired on 7 December 1941, the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The East Coast broadcast was interrupted by a radio announcement that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would be addressing the nation at noon the following day. The story was adapted for BBC Radio 2 in 1969 by Michael Hardwick, with Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. \\"The Red Circle\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of Bert Coules' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Joan Sims as Mrs Warren. In 2013, the story was adapted as an episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Of note  This is the last appearance of Inspector Tobias Gregson in Doyle's work. Explanations for this have been a matter of debate for readers. Although Gregson's meeting with Holmes is coincidental, he is swift to grasp the implications of getting his help and claims to have been grateful for his work with the Yard in the past. The Pinkerton detective Leverton is called \\"the hero of the Long Island cave mystery\\" by Holmes. But there is no explanation of what the Long Island cave mystery entailed. This is considered by some to be one of untold cases of the Holmesian canon, though it doesn't seem to have involved Holmes. This mystery seems paradoxical because there are no real caves on Long Island, New York, but there are caves on Long Island, in the Bahamas. Howe Street is a creation of Conan Doyle, overlooking Orme Street, which is commonly known as Great Ormond Street located in Central London, northeast from the British Museum. Watson describes Orme as a \\"narrow thoroughfare\\" and Howe in possession of \\"more pretentious houses.\\" References ;Notes ;Sources External links  produced by Granada Television (1994) Red Circle, The Adventure of the 1911 short stories Short stories adapted into films Works originally published in The Strand Magazine ","title":"The Adventure of the Red Circle"},{"id":"1337898","text":"Biscoitos is a civil parish in the municipality of Praia da Vit√≥ria, on the island of Terceira in the Portuguese Azores.

The population is 11,500 (1995). It is located northwest of Minsk, on the Valozhynka river in the Neman River basin, and the beginning of the Nalibokskaya Forest. Average temperatures are in January and in July with of annual rain. History=Overview The town was built on the main road leading from Vilnius to Minsk. It is divided into two sections: the \\"lower neighborhood\\" along the river and the \\"upper neighborhood\\" toward the hills. Half of the town square is framed by the remains of 12th century buildings, including a bell tower, a palace, and a monastery. Most of the other remaining impressive buildings in the town are from the 19th century.Pre-WWII images of old Valozhyn On the \\"Belarus Travel\\" website Valozhyn was established as a \\"privately owned city\\" by Count Tyszkiewicz in the 14th century, and remained so until the 20th century. The town was known for its fertile land, mainly supporting flax growing, as well as livestock farming of horses and cattle. In 1681 the Bernadine Monastery was established, which included a Christian college. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Valozhyn was part of Vilnius Voivodeship. In 1793, Valozhyn was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1839 Jozef Tyszkiewicz planted a large park and established a public zoo along the Valozhynka river. Three major fires, in 1815, 1880 and 1886, burned the city down, and it was rebuilt. During World War I, Valozhyn became a strategic location, and was occupied by the Russian army. Most of the residents were allowed to stay in parts of their occupied homes. The town was attacked and bombed and most of the residents left it. In 1919 the Polish National Army took the town. After attacks on Jewish residents, a self-defense organization was established. In the 2010s, the population declined, along with many other towns in Belarus.On Belarus Population Decline on volozhin.com. It was a county (powiat) centre in Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship during Second Polish Republic period. Yeshiva The Yeshiva \\"Etz Haim\\", known as the \\"Volozhin Yeshiva\\", was established in 1807, by Rabbi Chaim Volozyn the owner of a large textile factory, and with the assistance of the leading Graf Tyszkiewicz. This led to an increase in the Jewish population, which by the end of the nineteenth century was roughly equal to the Christian population in the town.A census from 1894 lists a population of 4500 in the town and its surroundings, with 2500 of them being Jewish (Leoni, ed., ·πæolo≈∫in, English section, p. 64). The Jewish religious seminary was the first of its kind, and served as a model for later similar establishments. It was closed by the authorities in 1892, but, by that time, had spawned a large number of similar institutions in Belarus, Russia and Lithuania. Holocaust On 17 September 1939, the first day of the Soviet invasion of Poland, Valozhyn was occupied by the Red Army. On 14 November 1939, Valozhyn was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. All previously allowed religious studies were forbidden. On the fourth day of Operation Barbarossa, on 25 June, 1941This day was the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hodesh Tamuz (beginning of the \\"sadness\\" Tamuz month) Valozhyn was bombed, captured by troops of the German Army Group Centre and mostly burned.Leoni, ed., ·πæolo≈∫in, 580. Several Jews were murdered by German soldiers who entered the town. On the next day, a 12-member Judenrat was appointed by the Gestapo and shortly after Stanislaw Torsky, a member of the Polish National Democrats \\"Endek\\" party with strongly antisemitic views, was appointed mayor. On his second day as mayor, he ordered the arrest of the town doctor along with his daughter, and 10 other Jewish people, who were savagely beaten and shot. On 25 July 1941, Valozhyn was placed under the administration of the newly formed Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. In August 1941, the Jewish residents of the town, approximately 3500 people, were moved to a Ghetto in the \\"Aropzu\\" neighbourhood,Consisting of \\"The Crooked\\" Street, Minsk and Dubinski St. along with Jewish residents from the neighboring towns Vishnyeva, Halshany and Ashmyany.Leoni, ed., ·πæolo≈∫in The Jews, as well as Russian prisoners in the area, were subjected to forced labour, tortured, underfed, and many of them publicly murdered. Local Christians who were caught having mercy or assisting the Jews in giving food received a similar fate. On October 28, 1941,Which was the Jewish \\"Day of the Rain\\" 7th of Heshvan The head of the Gestapo, named Moka, ordered all the Jews in the Ghetto to stand at a lecture of his, on work ethics. He freed most of them and kept around 200 people in the town's cinema. From there he took groups of 10 to a pit in the nearby forest and had them shot. Among the murdered was Jakob (Jani) Garber, the head of the Judenrat. Belarus police then stripped the dead of their belongings and covered the pit. Three people escaped and told the townspeople what had occurred. Public killings continued, including an incident where several Jews were forced to lie down on a spread Torah Scroll and were subsequently shot. On May 10, 1942, the Jews of Valozhyn were blamed for the killing of three Germans by Belarusian partisans several days earlier.Axis History Forum ‚Äì a pro German history, including that of WWII, brings a reference to five German officers being killed in \\"Wolocyn\\".A non-Jewish doctor, who had access to the local German leaders and their plans, warned the Jews a day in advance, but most did nothing about it. At 5 a.m., the Ghetto was cordoned by Belarus and Polish police along with the SS. They entered the Ghetto, killed the two Jewish policemen at the gate, and then began shooting and gathering the Jews into a large blacksmith shop, where they set a table with drinks surrounded by machine guns. While drinking and singing they shot into the building \\"to silence the crying\\". Inside the building, an argument ensued where some called to die while resisting, but the leading rabbi called on the people to keep up hopes till the last minute. The head of the police then called over a member of the Judenrat to polish his boots. When the man bent down, the policeman shot him in the head. This caused the Jews in the building who were able to watch this, to escape while scrambling to the roof and jumping off. Most were shot, but about 12 people escaped. The rest were held in the building till 5 p.m., and were then marched off to the forest in groups of children, women, elderly men and the rest, many in their prayer shawls and phylacteries from the morning prayers. They were marched through the Christian quarter, where they were met by dancing young men and women, singing, playing music and mocking the marched.English section, pp. 34 (image 687) The people were taken to a house (\\"the Bulowa house\\") near the cemetery, and shot. The house was then set on fire. A short while afterward the remaining Jews of Valozhyn were taken to the graveyard, forced to dig a large pit and were then buried alive by tractors and tanks who drove over them.Testimony of one of the six remaining Jews of the town. This site includes a recent picture of the Jewish cemetery On 5 July 1944, Valozhyn was recaptured by troops of the Soviet 3rd Belorussian Front during the Vilnius Offensive.

It is a more specific version of a family of games collectively called Liar's Dice, which has many forms and variants. This game can be played by two or more players and consists of guessing how many dice, placed under cups, there are on the table showing a certain number. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still have dice is the winner. Game play Each player has five dice and a dice cup Each player starts having five dice and a cup, which is used for shaking the dice and concealing the dice from the other players. Players roll die in order, to determine where and in what order they sit. Highest first, then next lowest and so on. In the event of a tie between 2 players, they simply re-roll until one gains a higher score. After deciding who starts the game (this can be done by making each player roll one die, for example), the players shake their dice in their cups, and then each player looks at their own dice, keeping their dice concealed from other players. Then, the first player makes a bid about how many dice of a certain value are showing among all players, at a minimum. Aces (dice showing a one) are wild, meaning that they count as every number. For example, a bid of \\"five threes\\" is a claim that between all players, there are at least five dice showing a three or an ace. The player challenges the next player (moving clockwise) to raise the bid or call dudo to end the round. ;Raise: also known as \\"bid\\" in most versions, a player can increase the quantity of dice (e.g. from \\"five threes\\" to \\"six threes\\") or the die number (e.g. \\"five threes\\" to \\"five sixes\\") or both. If a player increases the quantity, they can choose any number e.g. a bid may increase from \\"five threes\\" to \\"six twos\\". ;Bidding aces: a player who wishes to bid aces can halve the quantity of dice, rounding upwards. For instance, if the current bid is \\"five threes\\" then the next player would have to bid at least three aces. If the current bid is aces, the next player can call dudo or increase the quantity (e.g. \\"four aces\\") or bid a different number, in which case the lower bound on the quantity is one more than double the previous quantity‚Äîfor instance, from \\"three aces\\", a player wishing to bid fours would have to bid \\"seven fours\\" or higher. ;Call: also known as dudo, if the player calls, it means that they do not believe the previous bid was correct. All dice are then shown and, if the guess is not correct, the previous player (the player who made the bid) loses a die. If it is correct, the player who called loses a die. A player with no dice remaining is eliminated from the game.http://www.compendia.co.uk/dice.htm After calling, a new round starts with the player that lost a die making the first bid, or (if that player was eliminated) the player to that player's left. ;Spot on: also known as \\"calza\\" in some versions, the player claims that the previous bidder's bid is exactly right. If the number is higher or lower, the claimant loses the round; otherwise, the bidder loses the round. A \\"spot-on\\" claim typically has a lower chance of being correct than a challenge, so a correct \\"spot on\\" call sometimes has a greater reward, such as the player regaining a previously lost die. When a player first reaches one die (i.e. loses a round and goes from two dice to one), a Palifico round is played. During this round, the player makes an opening bid and their choice of die number cannot be changed. Aces are not wild during the round. For instance, the player who is down to one die may bid \\"two fours\\", and the next player's only options are to raise the quantity (to \\"three fours\\" or higher), or to call. The game ends when only one player has dice remaining; that player is the winner.  Rule Variants  Dice Loss Penalty Players lose as many dice as the difference between the challenged bid and the actual number of dice. This risk of having a wrong prediction is greater.

It was one of only two Krofft series produced exclusively for CBS (the second being 1984's Pryor's Place). Reruns of the show aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the \\"Krofft Superstars\\" package with six other Krofft series. Plot Like most of the Kroffts's productions, the show's opening sequence provides the setup of its fanciful premise: While loading food into various compartments to prepare a rocket for an upcoming mission, Barney instructs Junior to hit the \\"lunch\\" button, but Junior mistakenly hits the \\"launch\\" button. The rocket blasts off and takes them on various misadventures on alien planets. Typically, in each episode, their spaceship (a NASA lunar module) would be captured by aliens (one being played by John Carradine, who so impressed Denver with his acting skills during a scene that he was left speechless and missed his cue, requiring another take) and taken to some strange planet, or the spaceship would merely land somewhere. Then, either Barney and Junior, or the ship, would be taken away by the strange creatures on the planet. After some weird mission was carried out, the two astronauts would be reunited with the spaceship and be off on their next mission. Cast The show starred Bob Denver as Junior, a grey-haired (Denver was 40 years old at the time) and seemingly dim-witted but uniquely clever NASA maintenance worker, and Chuck McCann as Barney, his plump and grumpy co- worker. Patty Maloney played Honk, their furry little alien friend who made honking sounds out of the horn on the top of her head instead of speaking. EpisodesHome video availability The series was produced on videotape, and it is not known if any of its episodes have survived intact. To date, it has not been made available for home video viewing, especially with the question of ownership of the copyright to the Krofft brothers's productions remaining unanswered.

It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as His Last Bow. Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Devil's Foot\\" ninth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. Plot summary Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves at Poldhu in Cornwall one spring for the former's health, but the holiday ends with a bizarre event. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, a local gentleman, and Mr. Roundhay, the local vicar, come to Holmes to report that Tregennis's two brothers have gone insane, and his sister has died. Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village ('Tredannick Wollas'), played whist with them, and then left. When he came back in the morning, he found them still sitting in their places at the table, the brothers, George and Owen, laughing and singing, and the sister, Brenda, dead. The housekeeper had discovered them in this state, and fainted. The vicar has not been to see them yet. Tregennis says that he remembers one brother looking through the window, and then he himself turned to see some \\"movement\\" outside. He declares that the horrific event is the work of the devil. Mortimer Tregennis was once estranged from his siblings by the matter of dividing the proceeds from the sale of the family business, but he insists that all was forgiven, although he still lives apart from them. The doctor who was summoned, reckoned that she had been dead for six hours. He also collapsed into a chair for a while after arriving. Holmes goes to the house in question and, apparently carelessly, kicks over a watering pot, soaking everyone's feet. The housekeeper tells Holmes that she heard nothing in the night, and that the family had been particularly happy and prosperous lately. Holmes observes the remains of a fire in the fireplace. Tregennis explains that it was a cold, damp night. Afterwards, Holmes lays the case out to Watson thus: *Quite obviously, there is no point in attributing the tragedy to the Devil; therefore, what took place can only be the work of a human. *Whatever happened to those people happened right after Tregennis left, for they had not moved and everything was in the same place; *Mortimer Tregennis went swiftly back to the vicarage where he lives (a footprint sample was obtained in the watering pot \\"accident\\"); *The only suggestion of an explanation--the \\"movement\\"--comes from Mortimer Tregennis; *Given the weather, anyone appearing at the window and doing something horrifying enough to instantly kill someone would have had to come right up to the window thus trampling the flowerbed, which is still intact; *What on earth could this person at the window have done to cause such horror? None of this seems to make for an elementary case, but soon, new questions are raised. Dr. Leon Sterndale, the famous hunter and explorer, aborts his sailing from Plymouth after the vicar wired him (as the Tregennises and Sterndale are cousins) with the tragic news. He asks Holmes what his suspicions are, and is displeased when Holmes will not voice them. After Sterndale leaves, Holmes follows him discreetly. The morning after Holmes comes back to his room, apparently none the wiser for following Sterndale, the vicar arrives in a panic with the news that Mortimer Tregennis has now died in the same way as his sister. The two men, along with Watson, rush to Mortimer's room, and find it foul and stuffy, even though the window has been opened. A lamp is burning on the table beside the dead man. Holmes rushes about, examining many things. The upstairs window seems especially interesting. He also scrapes some ashes out of the lamp, and puts them in an envelope. Holmes deduces how the victims died or went mad and why people present when the death rooms were first opened fainted or felt unwell in each case. He tests his hypothesis by buying a lamp like the one in Tregennis's room, lighting it, and putting some of the collected \\"ashes\\" on the smoke guard. The smoke from this powder is so potent a poison that Holmes is immediately struck down. Watson is able to resist and drags Holmes out of the room just in time. It is clear to Holmes that Mortimer Tregennis poisoned his siblings, but who killed Mortimer? It is Dr. Sterndale, who left physical evidence at the vicarage clearly implicating himself. Holmes confronts Sterndale, who explains that he loved Brenda for years (but had been unable to marry her because of the current marriage laws which prevented him from divorcing his wife even though she abandoned him years ago) and killed Mortimer in revenge for the cruel murder. The poison is called Radix pedis diaboli (\\"Devil‚Äôs-foot root\\" in Latin),Q&A; New York Times 2 October 1990 Radix pedis diaboli does not exist in nature. Sterndale collected from Africa as a curiosity. The toxic contents of the plant root are vaporized by heat and diffuse into the local atmosphere. He once explained to Mortimer what it was and what it was capable of, who then stole some to murder his siblings by throwing it on the fire just before he left. Mortimer thought Sterndale would be at sea before news reached Plymouth, but Sterndale recognized the poison's effects from the vicar's description of the tragedy and deduced right away what had happened. Holmes's sympathies in this matter lie with Sterndale, and he tells him to go back to his work in Africa.

Luke AFB is a major training base of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), training pilots in the F-16 Fighting Falcon. On 31 March 2011 it was announced that the F-35 Lightning II would replace the F-16 as the primary training aircraft at Luke, although the date of deployment of the new aircraft to Luke and reorganization plans were not announced. On 16 July 2013, the Air Force announced that Luke AFB will house a total of 144 F-35A Lightning IIs.Additional F-35s coming to Luke AFB ‚Äì Af.mil, 16 July 2013 It is a designated Superfund site due to a number of soil and groundwater contaminants. History=Frank Luke, Jr. left Luke Air Force Base was named after Second Lieutenant Frank Luke (1897‚Äì1918). Lt Luke is a posthumous Medal of Honor recipient and the number two United States ace in World War I. Born in Phoenix in 1897, the \\"Arizona Balloon Buster\\" scored 18 aerial victories during World War I (14 of these German observation balloons) in the skies over France . Lieutenant Luke was shot down at Murvaux between Verdun and Stenay, France, on 29 September 1918, after he had destroyed three enemy balloons. Surviving the crash of his Spad, Lieutenant Luke drew two pistols and fired on German soldiers, killing several of them before he was killed. Luke Field, Oahu, Hawaii Territory (now the Naval Air Station Ford Island) was previously named in his honor.  Origins  In 1940, the U.S. Army sent a representative to Arizona to choose a site for an Army Air Corps training field for advanced training in conventional fighter aircraft. The city of Phoenix bought of land which they leased to the government at $1 a year effective 24 March 1941. On 29 March 1941, the Del. E. Webb Construction Co. began excavation for the first building at what was known then as Litchfield Park Air Base. Another base known as Luke Field, in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, released its name so the Arizona base could be called Luke Field. Advanced flight training in the AT-6 began at Luke in June that same year. The first class of 45 students, Class 41 F, arrived on 6 June 1941 to begin advanced flight training in the AT-6, although a few essential buildings had been completed. Flying out of Sky Harbor Airport until the Luke runways were ready, pilots received 10 weeks of instruction and the first class graduated 15 August 1941. Then-Captain Barry Goldwater served as director of ground training the following year. World War II left During World War II, Luke Field was the largest fighter training base in the Army Air Forces, graduating more than 12,000 fighter pilots from advanced and operational courses earning the nickname \\"Home of the Fighter Pilot\\". The base was under the control of the 37th Flying Training Wing (Advanced Single-Engine), Western Flying Training Command, AAF Flying Training Command. During the years of World War II, more than 17,000 pilots trained at Luke Field, making it the largest single engine advanced flying training school in the U.S. More than a million hours of flying were logged, primarily in the AT-6 Texan, along with some transitioning to P-40 Warhawk fighters and later the P-51 Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt. Although continually modified during the war years, the course of advanced flight training at Luke averaged about 10 weeks and included both flight training and ground school. Approximately 60 hours of flying instruction covered formation flying, navigation, and instrument flying, as well as a bit of aerial acrobatics. About 20 additional hours of flight practice concentrated on aerial and gunnery training. Ground school, or classroom training for the advanced flying course, varied from about 100 to 130 hours and was intermingled with flight time in the aircraft. Cadets flew in the morning and attended ground school in the afternoons, or flew training missions in the afternoon after a morning of ground school. At the peak of the training program at Luke, some students were required to attend night classes. Ground school included instruction in navigation, flight planning, radio equipment, maintenance, and weather. By 7 February 1944, pilots at Luke had achieved a million hours of flying time. A World War II film \\"A Guy Named Joe\\" included some footage filmed at Luke. By 1946, however, the number of pilots trained dropped to 299 and the base was deactivated 30 November that year. United States Air ForceAir Training Command= Three F-84Cs from the 3600th Flying Training Wing, flying over the Arizona desert Soon after combat started in Korea, Luke field was reactivated on 1 February 1951 as Luke Air Force Base, part of the Air Training Command (ATC) under the reorganized United States Air Force. A steady pipeline of trained bomber-escort pilots was needed by Strategic Air Command, and the mission of Luke AFB was to augment the jet fighter combat crew training in operation at Nellis AFB. The school at Luke was designated by ATC as the USAF Air Crew School (Fighter Bomber/Escort). The program was to be conducted by the Federalized Michigan Air National Guard 127th Fighter Group, which had transferred from Continental Air Command to ATC, effective 10 February. The wing moved from Romulus Airport, Michigan, to Luke on 23 February, and on 1 March ATC established the USAF Air Crew School (Fighter-Bomber/Escort) at Luke. Fighter-bomber training began on 1 March 1951 in the P-51 Mustang, being replaced by early-model F-84C Thunderjets. Effective 5 March, the 127th was redesignated as the 127th Pilot Training Wing. On 1 November 1952, the active-duty 3600th Flying Training Wing (Fighter) replaced the Air National Guardsmen. ATC flying training squadrons at Luke included: * 3601st Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 1 November 1952 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 * 3602d Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 * 3603d Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 * 3604th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 20 November 1952 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 The 3600th FTW became the dedicated training organization for both USAF and NATO pilots in the F-84. The F-84D began having electrical problems with the hot, dry Arizona air which dried out the aircraft's electrical insulation. They were replaced by F-84E, and shortly afterwards to the F-84G which was then in use by SAC. In October 1954, ATC re-designated the 3600th as a \\"Combat Crew Training Wing\\" to describe its mission better. In January 1954, the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak began to arrive, and three additional dedicated squadrons were activated: * 3605th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May 1954 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 * 3606th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May ‚Äì 13 October 1954 : Re-designated 3607th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 20 October 1954 ‚Äì 10 June 1957 * 3608th Fighter Interceptor (later Combat Crew Training) Squadron, 12 May 1954 ‚Äì 31 December 1957 F-84F's replaced the straight-winged earlier models in the original four squadrons by the end of 1956, giving the wing seven squadrons of twenty-one aircraft each, or about 150 aircraft. Thirty more were received in 1957 as some of the older production blocks were transferred to Air National Guard units or to reclamation at Davis-Monthan AFB. For several years, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base, New Mexico, had provided all atomic, biological, and chemical (ABC) warfare training for the Air Force. Beginning in October 1954, ATC added ABC instruction to its fighter pilot programs at Luke and Nellis. In addition, ATC established six general ABC courses to train aircrews already in the field, using mobile training teams. Formation of the USAF Thunderbirds On 25 May 1953 the 3600th Air Demonstration Team was officially organized and established at Luke, still officially carrying this designation, now known as the United States Air Force Thunderbirds. At Luke, the squadron initially operated F-84G Thunderjets, as the aircraft had to be able to show how good training made a typical aircraft easy to handle. The aircraft had to be stable for maneuvers in formation, reliable enough to meet show schedules, rugged for the demonstration team. In addition, the F-84G was the first fighter in the Air Force with mid-air refueling capability. To convert the aircraft from combat to demonstration, technicians removed the guns and plugged the gun ports. In 1955, the Air Force selected the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak as their second aircraft. The Thunderstreak was modified for the team by adding smoke tanks for the first time, and red, white, and blue drag chutes. In addition, the extreme heat from the lead aircraft, , required moving the slot's radio antenna from the jet's fin. For the first time, a solo was added to the diamond displays, increasing the show time to 19 minutes. The unit was reassigned to Nellis AFB, Nevada on 23 June 1956. =Tactical Air Command4510th Combat Crew Training Wing=F-100 Super Sabre era 4514th CCTS North American F-100F-10-NA Super Sabre 56-3917, about 1962. To MASDC 31 July 1979 as FE0567. Converted to QF-100F. By the end of 1957, ATC basing structure had changed considerably as the result of tactical commitments, decreased student load, and fund shortages. During 1958 ATC discontinued its Flying Training and Technical Training Air Force. As a result, Luke AFB was transferred to Tactical Air Command. This reassignment came about as the result of a USAF- directed study of the feasibility of putting combat crew training under the appropriate zone of interior operational commands. With the transfer to TAC, the ATC 3600th FTW was re-designated as the 4510th Combat Crew Training Wing, and flying training at Luke was changed to the F-100 Super Sabre. F-100 training squadrons were: * 4511th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 1 October 1964 (Formerly ATC 3601st CCTW) * 4512th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 15 October 1969 (Formerly ATC 3602d CCTW) * 4513th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January ‚Äì 1 November 1958 (Formerly ATC 3603d CCTW) * 4514th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 15 December 1969 (Formerly ATC 3604th CCTW) * 4515th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 18 January 1970 (Formerly ATC 3605th CCTW) * 4516th Combat Crew Training Squadron, 1 January 1958 ‚Äì 1 April 1970 (Formerly ATC 3608th CCTW) During the 1960s, thousands of American fighter pilots left Luke to carve their niche in the annals of Air Force history in the skies over Vietnam in the F-100. In July 1968, the first \\"LA\\" tail codes were placed on the tails of Luke-based aircraft. 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing=F-4 Phantom II era 311th TFTS F-4C-19-MC Phantom 63-7584, marked as Wing Commander's aircraft. Now at McChord Air Museum, Washington. The 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing replaced the provisional 4510th CCTW on 15 October 1969. Although Luke remained under the jurisdiction of Tactical Air Command, the HQ USAF-controlled (AFCON) 58th TFTW gave the wing at Luke a permanent lineage and history that the TAC provisional wing could not carry. The provisional squadrons of the 4510th were re-designated as follows: * 310th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4514th CCTS) * 311th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4515th CCTS) * 425th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (GSU at Williams AFB, Arizona) * 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4515th CCTS) * 550th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4516th CCTS) * 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4518th CCTS) (F-104G West German training squadron)418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (formerly 4519th CCTS) (F-104G West German training squadron)* left Upon activation of the 310th TFTS, the squadron began receiving new A-7D Corsair II ground attack aircraft from Ling-Temco-Vought, with a mission to train USAF pilots in the new aircraft. Its F-100s were reassigned to other squadrons which flew the F-100s of the 4510th CCTS. The 310th TFTS sent its A-7Ds to the 333d TFS at D-M in July 1971, and became an F-4C RTU. The 425th TFTS was assigned to the 58th as a Geographically Separated Unit in 1969, assigned to Williams AFB. The squadron was established in December 1963 as the 4441st CCTS, with a mission to train Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots on the Northrup F-5A Freedom Fighter. The F-5 training continued at Williams after the end of the Vietnam War, becoming a squadron to train Military Assistance Program (MAP) pilots from over 20 nations on the F-5. It was discontinued in 1989 and the 425th was inactivated. In the summer of 1971, the 58th TFTW received F-4C Phantom IIs, and the wing assumed the F-4 pilot training role that was formerly done by the 4453d CCTW at Davis-Monthan AFB, when D-M was converted to an operational A-7D base by the arrival of the 355th TFW from Takhli RTAFB, Thailand. F-15 Eagle era 555th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron McDonnell Douglas F-15A-11-MC Eagle 74-0111, arrival at Luke AFB, November 1974. First production F-15A arrival for training.In November 1974, the Air Force's newest air superiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle, came to Luke. To accommodate the F-15, the 555th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron was activated. The early F-15A's, however, were quite troublesome, with engine problems limiting their effectiveness and also their availability. It was not until June 1976 that a second F-15 training squadron was established, with the 4461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron sanding up on 23 June. The assets of the 4461st TFTS were re-designated as: 461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron: 1 July 1977. The 550th TFTS traded in its F-4s in August 1977 becoming the third F-15 training squadron. The F-15As, which remained troublesome throughout the 1970s, were replaced in 1982 with the updated F-15D. On 25 August 1979, the 405th Tactical Training Wing was activated at Luke AFB, Arizona by Tactical Air Command to consolidate the F-15 Eagle Replacement Training Unit (RTU) operations. It took over the 425th, 461st 550th and 555th Tactical Fighter Training Squadrons The 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron converted from F-4 Phantom II to F-15 training in January 1981 specifically to support the TAC Air Defense Command (ADTAC) training mission inherited from the inactivated Aerospace Defense Command which was merged into TAC. On 19 November 1990, the 555th TFTS changed its course from air superiority combat training with the Eagle to air defense interceptor training with the F-15C/D when TAC began assigning F-15s to interceptor duty, the 426th being inactivated. The 461st TFTS received first F-15E Strike Eagle, July 1988, and the 550th TFTS became the second F-15E Strike Eagle training squadron in March 1989. On 1 October 1991, due to the implementation of the Objective Wing at Luke and the \\"One base, one wing\\" policy, the 405th TTW was shut down and the F-15s were reassigned back to the 58th TTW. In 1993, 1st Lt Jeannie M. Flynn became the first woman to complete training in the F-15E Strike Eagle at Luke. After earning a master's degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University, she graduated first in her UPT class at Laughlin AFB in December 1992, and chose the F-15 after Chief of Staff General Merrill McPeak opened the door for women to fly combat aircraft.

Luke-based F-16s began carrying tail codes \\"LF\\". 310th TFTS officially began training fighter pilots 2 February 1983. * 312th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, activated on 1 October 1984, First F-16C squadron in the Air Force * 314th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, activated on 1 October 1986, Second F-16C squadron in the Air Force In 1990 Luke AFB was placed on the National Priorities List, often called the Superfund list in 1990. After many years of cleanup and remediation, on 22 April 2002 became the first Air Force base to be removed from the list, after satisfying the requirement to remove pollution dating back as far as World War II. 58th Operations Group The end of the Cold War in the early 1990s brought significant changes to the base. On 1 October 1991, the 58th Tactical Training Wing adopted the Air Force Objective Organization Plan, and was re-designated simply as the 58th Fighter Wing (58 FW). All operational fighter training squadrons were reassigned to the new 58th Operations Group (58 OG). Training units also re-designated as \\"Fighter Squadrons\\". Units assigned to the 58 OG were: * 310th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon * 311th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon * 312th Fighter Squadron, inactivated, aircraft to 310th, 311th, 314th FS * 314th Fighter Squadron, F-16C/D Fighting Falcon * 461st Fighter Squadron, F-15E Strike Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991) * 550th Fighter Squadron, F-15E Strike Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991) * 555th Fighter Squadron, F-15C/D Eagle (reassigned back from 405th FW, 1 October 1991) In 1991, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission ordered that all flightline activities cease at MacDill AFB by 1993. The host unit at MacDill AFB, the 56th Fighter Wing, would move its F-16 training to Luke AFB, and Luke would be an exclusive F-16 Fighting Falcon training base. The F-15s would be reassigned to Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina in order to accommodate additional F-16 training at Luke. In addition, the 58th Fighter Wing would be inactivated and moved to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, with the historical senior 56th FW taking over all assets at Luke. At Kirtland, the wing would be re designated as the 58th Special Operations Wing, leaving all aircraft and equipment at Luke, and be reassigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, replacing the Air Training Command 542d Crew Training Wing. On 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command was inactivated, and the new Air Combat Command (ACC) replaced it, assuming jurisdiction of Luke AFB. On 30 December 1992, the 425th Fighter Squadron was activated at Luke AFB. The mission of the 425th was to provide advanced weapons and tactics continuation for Republic of Singapore Air Force's F-16 pilots and maintenance personnel. Aircraft had already arrived for the squadron in October and shortly after in the new year pilot training began in January 1993. =Air Education and Training Command= left On 1 April 1994, after 24 years at Luke AFB, the 58th Fighter Wing was replaced by the 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW), relocated from MacDill AFB, Floridas due to Base Realignment and Closure Commission action, as part of the Air Force Heritage Program. With the reassignment, jurisdiction of Luke AFB was transferred to Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) as a result of the Air Force deciding to consolidate all Air Force training programs under AETC. The 56th Operations Group assumed control over all operational fighter squadrons. The transfer of Luke to Air Education and Training Command gave the command front-line aircraft, bases and facilities that could be used for realistic operational training. With the return of AETC to Luke, it was possible to produce a task-certified or more mission ready apprentice, operational units could reduce the amount of on-the-job training provided to new airmen. Within a year, the wing realignment to make the 56 OG an exclusive F-16 group took place. The 555th Fighter Squadron was reassigned to USAFE on 25 March 1994 as part of a realignment of Aviano AB, Italy; its F-15C/D Eagles being sent to Tyndall AFB, Florida where F-15 air defense interceptor training was being consolidated under First Air Force. The F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons (461st, 550th) were also inactivated, with their Strike Eagles being sent to Seymour Johnson AFB under the 4th Fighter Wing. F-15 training ended with the last \\"LA\\" tail coded F-15 (Luke Arizona) leaving on 26 September 1995 when the 550th Fighter Squadron inactivated, 21 years after the first TF-15A arrived at Luke. With the transfer of the Eagles, additional F-16 training units were assigned to the 56 OG, all tail-coded \\"LF\\" (Luke Falcons): * 61st Fighter Squadron, 1 April 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB) * 62d Fighter Squadron, 18 March 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB) * 63d Fighter Squadron, 1 April 1994 (formerly at MacDill AFB) * 308th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG * 309th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG * 310th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG * 425th Fighter Squadron, reassigned from 58th OG (joint USAF-RSAF unit) The 21st Fighter Squadron was activated on 8 August 1996 to train Taiwanese Republic of China Air Force F-16A/B crews at Luke AFB. Empty hangars were refurbished and aircrews were pulled in from other units on base. By January 1997 several ROCAF F-16A/B block 20s had been delivered and the first training flights began for their crews. Despite being A/B models, the aircraft were new construction from General Dynamics, with modern avionics and engines, and were considered to be more advanced than the F-16C/Ds being flown from Luke AFB. The aircraft carry USAF markings and serial numbers, and also the \\"LF\\" tail code. On 20 September 1999, an F-16D crashed at Luke AFB, marking the 56th Fighter Wing's seventh Class A mishap in FY99. In all cases, the pilots ejected safely. Engine problems caused most of the mishaps. The 56th Fighter Wing commander, Brig. Gen. John Barry, grounded the wing's F-16s after the second mishap. Maintenance personnel discovered that engine augmentor ducts had failed in both cases. They developed a new inspection procedure to identify cracks, which was subsequently used throughout the Air Force. A manufacturing defect in turbine blades was responsible for many of the mishaps, and General Barry grounded the fleet a second time to allow maintainers to upgrade the turbine blades, which improved safety. When 1st Lt Joshua Padgett completed the F-16 basic course on 8 March 2000, he became the 50,000th fighter pilot to graduate from Luke AFB, Arizona, since the Army Air Forces started training there in July 1941 After the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, Luke suspended routine flying training operations, as the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the nation's airways to all but select military flights. Aircraft of the 56th Fighter Wing were deployed to fly Combat Air Patrols over New York City and Washington, D.C. in the immediate aftermath of the attacks in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Although the 56th Fighter Wing does not deploy aircraft to United States Air Forces Central Command Expeditionary units as part of the Global War on Terrorism, Luke Airmen routinely deploy to USAFCENT in AEF deployment cycles, engaging in combat in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF); Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and other expeditionary operations as tasked. In 2002 the 56th Fighter Wing became responsible for the nearby Barry M. Goldwater Training Range, became concerned that urban development near the base would curtail flying training if left unchecked. In addition, the Munitions Storage Area (MSA) stood outside of the base compound, adding a burden to the Security Forces Squadron. In October 2002, Senator John McCain of Arizona shepherded a MILCON funding insert of $13 million to purchase needed to incorporate the MSA into the base perimeter and to acquire additional land in order to preserve access to the Goldwater Range. BRAC 2005 directed that the older Block 25 F-16s be sent to Air National Guard units, this change reduced the number of fighter squadrons, with the 61st and 63d Fighter Squadrons inactivating in 2009 and 2010. =Air Defense Command= In 1959 Air Defense Command established a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-21) at Luke AFB. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the Phoenix Air Defense Sector (PhADS), established on 15 June 1959. PhADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966, and re-designated as the 27th Air Division. DC-21 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 27th AD until 19 November 1969 it was inactivated and its assets absorbed by the 26th Air Division. DC-21 was inactivated on 9 December 1983 when technology advances made SAGE obsolete. =Air Force Reserve= Air Force Reserve training began at Luke AFB in 1960 with the activation of the 302d Air Rescue Squadron. The 302d had a distinguished heritage and lineage, being formed as the 302d Fighter Squadron, one of four African-American fighter squadrons to enter combat during World War II. It saw combat in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) and Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) from 17 February 1944 ‚Äì 20 February 1945. For many years the 302d operated a variety of Air Rescue helicopters from the base, training for and performing search and rescue (SAR) missions, in addition to some medical air evacuation missions. In 1974, its mission changed to training for a combat SAR role, while continuing to perform some search and rescue. The squadron's mission changed again, in 1987, to a fighter role as the 302d Tactical Fighter Squadron, being assigned to the AFRES (now AFRC) 944th Fighter Wing. The 302d TFS was equipped with block 25/32 F-16C Fighting Falcons, carrying tail code \\"LR\\". The 302d TFS trained for counterair, interdiction, and close air support missions. It deployed several times since late 1992 to Turkey to help enforce the no-fly zone over Iraq and to Italy to support UN air operations in the Balkans, The 302d FS was moved to Holloman AFB, New Mexico and converted to F-22A Raptors on 2 October 2007. The 69th Fighter Squadron was activated at Luke on 1 February 2010, equipped with Block 42 F-16Cs, tail code \\"LF\\", 69th FS carrying a black tail band. The 69th had formerly been assigned to Luke as an active-duty squadron from 1969‚Äì1983, flying Lockheed F-104G Starfighters training pilots from the West German Air Force (See below). West German Air Force training at Luke Three West German Air Force Lockheed F-104G Starfighters fly in formation over Arizona. From 1957 to 1965 830 pilots from the West German air force were trained on the F-84 at Luke AFB under Air Training Command. Since Northern European weather and operational restrictions placed severe limitations on the amount of training, Luke AFB was chosen, where flying conditions were ideal for most of the time. On 4 April 1963 the USAF and the Federal Republic of Germany signed contracts for a unique pilot training program. One agreement called for undergraduate pilot training for West German Air Force (GAF) and West German Navy (GN) students in Cessna T-37 Tweet and Northrop T-38 Talon jet aircraft at Williams AFB, Arizona. The second agreement provided for advanced fighter training in the Lockheed Lockheed F-104G Starfighter at Luke AFB. The two programs were interrelated. Graduates of the basic flight training at Williams were programmed for the advanced training at Luke, resulting in an almost two- year tour of duty in the United States for the young German pilots. The advanced training at Luke was the unique aspect of the program. The host 4510th Combat Crew Training Wing (CCTW) at Luke was tasked with providing the advanced flying training. On 20 February 1964, the 4540th Combat Crew Training Group (CCTG) was organized and designated to conduct GAF training at Luke. The group was activated on 1 April. Prior to designating the 4540th CCTG, the 4518th Combat Crew Training Squadron was activated on 1 March 1964 and was reassigned to the 4540th CCTG upon the later's activation. A second squadron, the 4519th Combat Crew Training Squadron, was assigned to the group, effective 1 July 1964. The German unit was named \\"2. Deutsche Luftwaffen- Ausbildungsstaffel F-104 USA (2. DtLwAusbStff F-104 USA)\\" (2nd German Air Force Training Squadron F-104 USA). Although remaining German property, the Starfighters carried USAF insignia and were assigned American serial numbers. By mid July 1964, 23 TF-104G and 12 F-104G were assigned to Luke. On 26 August 1964 a total of 14 USAF F-104 instructor pilots graduated in the second class conducted at Luke. With a sufficient number of aircraft and instructor pilots, preparations were on target to receive the first advanced training class scheduled for October 1964. Aircraft inventories at Luke peaked in 1967 and 1968. In 1967, 100 aircraft were assigned, 62 F-104G and 38 TF-104G: The total increased to 102 in 1968, 61 F-104G models and 41 TF-104G models.69th TFTS/West German F-104G StarfighterMajor changes occurred in organization on 1 October 1969 when the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing (TFTW) was activated, replacing the 4510th CCTW as the host unit at Luke. Concurrently, the 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron and the 418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron were activated as F-104 training units, replacing the 4518th CCTS and 4519th CCTS. By 1975, a decrease in training requirements was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the fleet size. The two squadrons were consolidated in 1976 with the 418th TFTS inactivating on 1 October 1976. Also a storage program was started to preserve the lifespan of the aircraft. As of 30 September 1975 some 13 aircraft were in flyable storage. Training of West German Air Force pilots in the F-104G continued until late 1982. The Germans flew more than 900 Starfighters totaling an excess of 269,750 hours and produced 1,868 F-104 pilots. The 69th TFTS inactivated on 16 March 1983. NATO F-104 Pilot Training A third F-104G squadron at Luke, the 4443d Combat Crew Training Squadron, differed from the West German squadrons in that it was associated with the Military Assistance Program (MAP) with students from NATO and other friendly nations being trained in the Starfighter. On 22 May 1964, TAC relieved the 4443d CCTS from its assignment to the 831st Air Division at George AFB, California, and reassigned it to the 4540th CCTG, effective 1 August 1964. The move consolidated all F-104 training at one location. The F-104s that purchased with MAP funds and were assigned USAF serial numbers for record-keeping purposes although they never carried USAF insignia. On 15 June 1969 the 4443rd CCTS was inactivated.

The host command at Luke is the 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW), under Air Education and Training Command's 19th Air Force. The base population includes about 7500 military members and 15,000 family members. With about 80,000 retired military members living in greater Phoenix, the base services a total population of more than 100,000 people.  F-16 Fighting Falcon operations  The host unit, the 56th Fighter Wing, is tasked to train F-35 and F-16 fighter pilots and maintainers. Historically, the wing graduated more than 400 F-16 pilots and 470 crew chiefs annually. The 56th FW is composed of four groups, 27 squadrons, including six training squadrons. There are several tenant units on base, including the 944th Fighter Wing, assigned to 10th Air Force and the Air Force Reserve. The 56th Fighter Wing also trains more than 700 maintenance technicians each year. In addition to flying and maintaining the F-16, Luke airmen also deploy to support on- going operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and to combatant commanders in other locations around the world. In 2004, more than 900 Luke airmen deployed, with most supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 56th Operations Group (OG) has operational control and responsibility for the entire fighter-training mission at Luke. It has the tail code: \\"LF\\". It comprises: * 21st Fighter Squadron (\\"The Gamblers\\", tailband: white & red) * 61st Fighter Squadron (\\"Top Dogs\\", 1st F-35 Lightning II squadron on base, re-activated October 2013) * 62d Fighter Squadron (\\"Spikes\\", 2nd F-35 squadron on base, re-activated June 2015) * 63d Fighter Squadron (\\"Panthers\\", 3rd F-35 squadron on base, re-activated August 2016) * 308th Fighter Squadron (\\"Emerald Knights\\", 4th F-35 squadron on base, re-activated December 2018) * 309th Fighter Squadron (\\"Wild Ducks\\", tailband: blue & white) * 310th Fighter Squadron (\\"Top Hats\\", tailband: green & yellow) * 425th Fighter Squadron (\\"Black Widows\\", tailband: red & black) * 607th Air Control Squadron \\"Rattlers\\" * 56th Operations Support Squadron \\"Wizards\\" * 56th Training Squadron The 56th Maintenance Group (MXG) provides aircraft maintenance on more than 79 F-16s and 29 F-35s, for the Air Force's only active duty F-16 and F-35 training wing. The 56th Mission Support Group (MSG) sustains the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II, provides for the community, and delivers responsive combat support. The 56th Medical Group (MDG) is an outpatient only Medical Treatment Facility, which serves more than 84,000 beneficiaries in the Phoenix area. The 944th Fighter Wingis an adjunct Air Force Reserve wing to the 56th FW that trains Air Force F-16 pilots for reserve duty. It comprises the 69th Fighter Squadron (\\"Werewolves\\", tailband: black). Public reception The public has been more accommodating to the military operations at Luke Air Force base compared to other Arizona installations like the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, according to a 2015 study. This is due to a buffer of public land around it, that helps against encroachment and land use conflicts. Also, the private sector in Glendale has been helping to maintain the buffer of public land, and with it the Arizona defense economy. This is because if encroachment impacts a site's mission, it loses value for the military operation, and base closure is more likely to occur.  Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range  An integral part of Luke's F-16 fighter pilot training mission is the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. The range consists of of relatively undisturbed Sonoran Desert southwest of Luke Air Force Base between Yuma and Tucson south of Interstate 8. Overhead are of airspace where pilots practice air-to-air maneuvers and engage simulated battlefield targets on the ground. Roughly the size of Connecticut, the immense size of the complex allows for simultaneous training activities on nine air-to-ground and two air-to-air ranges. The Luke Air Force Base Range Management Office manages the eastern range activities and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma oversees operations on the western portion.  Naval Operational Support Center (NOSC) Phoenix  Since June 2012, Luke AFB has been the permanent home of Naval Operational Support Center (NOSC) Phoenix of the US Navy. A NOSC is a facility used to provide operational support for training and administrative services to Navy Reserve Units. NOSC Phoenix supports over 750 Navy Reservists in sixteen Navy Reserve units. The new , one-story facility is located on a site at Luke AFB with sufficient parking and a secured perimeter to meet current anti-terrorism and force protection standards. NOSC Phoenix serves a full-time command and administrative staff, a medical unit, and reservists during drill weekends. It also has a drill hall, command staff offices, reserve unit administration spaces, medical and dental examination areas, six classrooms, a distance learning center, a physical fitness room, and a quarterdeck. The $11.2 million facility is the first LEED Platinum certified building of the US Navy Reserve Force.  Based units  Flying and notable non-flying units based at Luke Air Force Base.

The magazine is based in London. History=Development and launch Marketed with the tagline \\"For men who should know better\\", Loaded was launched in May 1994.John Plunkett \\"Loaded: its rise and fall\\", The Guardian, 20 August 2010 It was originally published by IPC Media who committed to its initial development following a discussion between the company's executives and James Brown during a job interview for the editorship of New Musical Express, also part of the IPC group.David Stam and Andrew Scott Inside Magazine Publishing, Abingdon: Routledge, 2014, p. 60 In development for a year, Loaded was predicted to be a flop, but IPC considered it a low- risk investment because the advertising department of its Music & Sport division already existed and the promotional budget was minimal. IPC itself had little faith in the magazine; according to Brown the staff were initially only contracted for 3 months after the launch.James Brown \\"Loaded never really fitted in at IPC\\", The Guardian, 20 August 2010 Taking its title from the Primal Scream song of the same name, the magazine was founded by Mick Bunnage, Tim Southwell and Brown.Loaded magazine founder James Brown has joined Sumo.tv  Media  MediaGuardian In its early days, the magazine's readership was once described as \\"50% Sun readers and 50% Guardian readers\\". Speaking about Loaded audience in 2001, Brown remarked: \\"I knew that most of the guys in the country weren't like those other magazines, like GQ and Arena, were telling them they were. They weren't driving around in Range Rovers with very expensive Savile Row suits.\\" He cited the irreverent comic Viz as an inspiration for Loaded,William Cook \\"All in the worst possible taste\\", The Guardian, 18 November 2004 while Holly Baxter has suggested that Playboy was an influence on the title.Holly Baxter \\"Death of the lad mags? Loaded magazine bids farewell\\", The Independent, 27 March 2015 Brown wrote in the May 1994 launch issue: \\"Loaded is a new magazine dedicated to life, liberty and the pursuit of sex, drink, football and less serious matters. Loaded is music, film, relationships, humour, travel, sport, hard news and popular culture. Loaded is clubbing, drinking, eating, playing and eating. Loaded is for the man who believes he can do anything, if only he wasn't hungover\\".\\"Loaded: covers from the classic years\\", The Guardian, 20 August 2010 The original editorial team also included Martin Deeson, Jon Wilde, Rowan Chernin, Pete Stanton and Derek Harbinson. The first issue, according to Brown, \\"featured stories on Eric Cantona, Paul Weller, a travel story about a man whose 'bird' was possibly eaten by a shark and photos of a young actress called Liz Hurley in see- through lace underwear.\\" 1990s Loaded captured the lad culture of the time.Alok Jha: Lad culture corrupts men as much as it debases women  Comment is free  The Guardian Deeson remarked: \\"I think we just caught some wave in Nineties, because the Eighties had been fairly miserable. Then we got into the Nineties and things started to loosen up a bit. ... It just seemed like a good time, and we just were part of it and caught that wave.\\" The magazine won the prestigious PPA Magazine of the Year Award two years in succession, in 1995 and 1996. Brown resigned from his post at Loaded in April 1997 to become editor of GQ.Paul McCann \\"The rise and rise of the laddery from 'Loaded'\\", The Independent, 19 April 1997 He was quoted as saying at the time: \\"I won't talk about Laddism and all that bollocks, that shows a lack of understanding of what Loaded is about. I'm not a 25-year-old loafer any more, I'm confronting new things in my life now and GQ will give me much greater scope... It is a natural step on.\\" Staff at Loaded had mixed feelings about Brown considering him to be a bully while more widely he had acquired a reputation for heavy drinking and cocaine use.Tim Hulse \\"James Brown, The Latest Edition\\", The Independent, 5 October 1997 Circulation peaked in the second half of 1998 with monthly sales of 457,318, although FHM surpassed competing titles with a 775,000 monthly circulation. At the end of 1999, with circulation in the market sector now beginning to decline, Loaded dropped what was described by Meg Carter in The Independent as its \\"babe-only cover policy\\".Meg Carter \\"Lad mags are growing up. Of course they are\\", The Independent, 18 January 2000 Launch Deputy Editor and later Editor, Tim Southwell, wrote about the early years of Loaded in Getting Away With It (Ebury Press, 1998).

Loaded changed its policy of a few years earlier and increased its depiction of female nudity. Standard industry practices for news' vendors were revised in March 2006 after an agreement was reached between the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the Home Office following concerns that lads' mags were within the reach of children. The result was that Loaded found itself displayed on the top shelf next to copies of Penthouse and other pornographic magazines.Steve Bloomfield \\"Lads' mags banished to the top shelf\\", The Independent, 26 March 2006 The circulation declined: in the first six months of 2007, Loaded recorded a 35% drop in circulation compared to the first half of 2006.New Statesman ‚Äì The dark world of lads' mags In February 2010, Loaded received an ABC circulation figure that was down \\"just 2% over the period,\\" compared with what Media Week called \\"eye-popping falls\\" for its competitors.John Reynolds \\"Magazine ABCs: More pain for established lads' titles\\", Media Week, 11 February 2010 In 2007, Loaded was voted 49th in a poll organised by industry website goodmagazine.com's for the Top 51 Magazines of All Time, for the \\"Smartest, Prettiest, Coolest, Funniest, Most Influential, Most Necessary, Most Important, Most Essential, etc.\\"GOOD Magazine  Goodmagazine ‚Äì The 51 Best* Magazines Ever In the May 2008 issue of Loaded the editorial team had to print an apology to Heinz after claiming in an earlier issue that Heinz had produced a version of alphabetti spaghetti especially for the German market that consisted solely of tiny pasta shaped swastikas. 2010s IPC Media sold Loaded, along with SuperBike, to Vitality Publishing in 2010.

Loaded was bought by independent publishing house, Simian Publishing in September 2013. Print re-launch and closure Loaded re-launched for its twentieth anniversary in 2014 under editor Aaron Tinney. Tinney commissioned self-proclaimed militant feminist Julie Burchill to write a regular 'agony aunt' column and Lia Nicholls as Deputy Editor, making her the first woman with an editorial role at the magazine. The re-launch also saw original Loaded writer Martin Deeson return to the magazine. In an article in The Independent, Deeson was quoted as comparing Tinney to James Brown, the original \\"iconoclastic\\" Loaded editor. The Co-operative chain announced in August 2013 that it would soon only sell magazines like Loaded if they were sealed in a plastic \\"modesty bag\\".Jonathan Paige \\"Co-op to remove 'lads mag' Nuts magazine from shelves because it won't tone down front page\\", The Independent, 8 August 2013 Unlike some of its rivals, the magazine chose to adopt the practice.Ella Alexander \\"'Nuts' final issue\\", The Independent, 1 May 2014 The following year, in July, Loaded dropped the photographs of partially clothed women after the lads' mag sector as a whole had faced opposition to their publication and display on covers from other supermarket chains, advertisers and feminist campaigners.Hannah Pool \\"The demise of lads' mags and the rise of feminism\\", The Independent, 4 July 2014 When a reporter for the London Evening Standard asked if the policy on female nudity had changed, a spokesman for Simian Publishing commented: \\"Yes ‚Äî we‚Äôre going to be far more discerning and sophisticated from now on,\\"\\"Respectable street beckons for the lads\\", London Evening Standard, 2 July 2014 The magazine's closure was announced in late March 2015, the last issue being for April of that year.

In the opinion of Holly Baxter, Loaded \\"tried to incorporate interviews and features that would make the publication seem a little less seedy\\" than Nuts, its more down market rival which closed in 2014.  Re-launch online  On 11 November 2015 Loaded re-launched online with new owners The Color Company. The Guardians Mark Sweney wrote at the time of the online re-launch in November 2015 that Loaded had been given: \\"a new lease of life as a digital publication dropping the scantily-clad girls of its heyday in favour of classier content\\" intending to become a quality men's magazine. Actor Colin Farrell was among the initial interviewees. Continuing the last version of Loaded in the final eight print issues, editor Aaron Tinney was quoted as saying, \\"It is quality men's magazine content online.

This effort was assisted by the UNOSOM I mission, in light of a severe food crisis initiated and exacerbated by ongoing factional fighting. The operation was spearheaded by the United States and other troop-contributing Western nations. However, most of the relief supplies were looted by militants shortly upon arrival. This prompted the UN to pass Resolution 794, which paved the way for the more robust, multinational Operation Restore Hope. Background Rules of Engagement for Operation Provide Relief, 1992. In January 1991, President of Somalia Mohammed Siad Barre, was overthrown by a coalition of rebel groups, including the United Somali Congress, Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), Somali National Movement (SNM), Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Movement (SDM). Many of the opposition groups began competing for influence in the ensuing power vacuum. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert power over the capital Mogadishu.Library Information and Research Service, The Middle East: Abstracts and index, Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327. In June 1991, a ceasefire was nominally agreed upon. The same month, the SNM declared secession in the northwestern part of Somalia. Renaming the region the \\"Republic of Somaliland\\", the group's leader Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur was installed as president. In September 1991, the armistice was breached as fighting broke out again between Mogadishu factions. The armed confrontations continued in the following months and spread throughout the country, with over 20,000 people killed or injured by the end of the year. These battles led to the destruction of the local agricultural sector, which in turn precipitated a food crisis in large parts of Somalia. The international community in response sent emergency rations. As a consequence, an estimated 300,000 people are believed to have died of starvation between 1991 and 1992. In July 1992, after a ceasefire between the opposing southern-based clan factions, the United Nations sent 50 military observers to supervise the food supply distributions. Humanitarian operation Eighteen U.S. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve C-130s flew 20 missions per day from Moi International Airport (Mombasa Airport) to Somalia for Operation Provide Relief. Operation Provide Relief began in August 1992, when the White House announced US military transports would support the multinational UN relief effort in Somalia. Ten C-130s and 400 people deployed to the Moi International Airport during Operation Provide Relief, airlifting aid to remote areas in Somalia to reduce reliance on truck convoys. The Air Force C-130s delivered 48,000 tons of food and medical supplies in six months to international humanitarian organizations. When this proved inadequate to stop the massive death and displacement, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 794 in December 1992 authorizing the use of all necessary means to assure a protected environment for conducting humanitarian operations.United Nations, Security Council resolution 794 (1992), 24 April 1992, para. 3 In response, the U.S. launched Operation Restore Hope, a major coalition operation to assist and protect relief activities. After a long and protracted effort, the operation was eventually successful in saving many lives, as well as in de-escalating the high-intensity conflict into low-level, local skirmishes. However, the initiative has been criticized for expanding beyond its original boundaries (\\"mission creep\\"). The Washington-based Refugee Policy Group NGO in November 1994 suggests that any assessment of the success of Operation Provide Relief is \\"so fraught with methodological problems that it is rarely attempted.\\" As such, it asserts that excess mortality had already peaked by the time that the first relief programs in and flights to southern Somalia were set up. The think tank offers a conservative estimate that about 100,000 lives were saved as a result of international assistance, 10,000 of which occurred after U.S. troops arrived in December 1992.

Ucluelet means \\"people of the safe harbour\\" in the indigenous Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) language. As of 2016, its population was 1,717, a 5.5% increase from 1,627 in 2011.  Geography  Ucluelet is located at the western edge of Barkley Sound, northwest of the British Columbia provincial capital, Victoria, on the outer west coast of Vancouver Island. The closest city is Port Alberni, which is approximately to the east. The District of Tofino is northwest of Ucluelet on Highway 4. In between Tofino and Ucluelet is the Long Beach unit of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Barkley Sound lies southeast of Ucluelet and is a marine area that features the Broken Islands Group unit of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The fishing and scientific research community of Bamfield lies on its farther shore.  History  Boats in Ucluelet's Inner Harbour. Archaeological evidence indicated the presence of First Nations along the outer west coast of Vancouver Island for at least 4,300 years. British Columbia‚Äôs recorded history began with European explorers searching for the Northwest Passage. Juan P√©rez anchored and traded in 1774 on the west coast of Vancouver Island, at Nootka Sound, north of Ucluelet. In 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra sailed along the coast of Vancouver Island, heading north for Alaska. He did not stop, but roughly charted the coast in the vicinity of Kyuquot Sound. Captain James Cook of the British Navy anchored in Nootka Sound and went ashore in 1778. Maritime fur traders followed, such as Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, who in 1787 arrived near Ucluelet harbour in Barkley Sound in search of sea otter pelts. In 1870, fur sealers came to the area seeking ports for vessels working the Bering Sea sealing grounds. Captain Francis, the owner of several sealing schooners, established a trading post in Ucluelet harbour. Ucluelet began to grow along with the sealing industry and became a bustling town. In the 1890s, more settlers began arriving on the news of pending road access from Port Alberni. Fishing was excellent and gold was to be found on Florencia Bay. Gold was found, but it was so fine and in such little quantity that it could not be worked profitably. The Presbyterian Church built a Mission House and school and a doctor was dispatched to the area in 1898. By 1900, more settlers had moved to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Development began bringing more infrastructure and services. The Canadian Pacific Railway operated a small freight boat sailing from Victoria three times a month. In 1903, a whaling station was established in Barkley Sound. In Ucluelet, the Amphitrite Point Light lighthouse, a government telegraph office, and a lifeboat station were built. As the First World War began, the fishing industry had started. When World War II began, the Government of Canada took measures to protect Vancouver Island‚Äôs west coast from potential invasions. The military established a seaplane base in Ucluelet and a land base at Long Beach. The road to Tofino, which had been worked on for thirty years, was finally completed. In 1941, the Direction Finding capabilities at RCAF station Ucluelet (Long Beach) were placed at the disposal of the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1942, RCN operators at Ucluelet, Coal Harbour and Alliford Bay were transferred to Gordon Head in Victoria. Ucluelet continued to prosper after the war luring more residents hoping for prosperity to the region. In August 1959, the long-awaited road to Port Alberni was finally opened. Tourism Ucluelet history page On February 26, 1952, Ucluelet became incorporated. Its status was changed to a District in 1997 to reflect, in part, the increasing population and increasing importance within the region. Climate Ucluelet has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) of the type found in Ireland, with mild, rainy winters and cool summers owing to its coastal location. As such, temperatures that are outside the range of are rare. Precipitation is high, averaging around per year, with most of it concentrated in the winter months. Even so, precipitation is significant in all months with no month averaging below of precipitation. Although it has an average snowfall of , the median is 0, meaning over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall; this makes this climate unique in Canada.  Demographics  Very important in local society is the presence of the Yuu≈Çu îi≈Ç îat·∏• people (\\"people of the safe landing place\\" or \\"people of the safe harbour\\" in Nuu-chah-nulth), whose government is the Yuu≈Çu îi≈Ç îat·∏• Government. Their government is located in Hitacu, which is located from the town of Ucluelet. Both Ucluelet and nearby Tofino have become target sites for the construction of resorts, restaurants and adventure tourism centres. Although the local population has historically been based on fishing and logging, increasing numbers of seasonal residents pass through both communities to work in the tourism and hospitality industry. The ancestry of most residents is European (81%), with sizeable Indigenous (9%), Japanese (4%), and Filipino (3%) populations. Health and education Public education is offered by School District 70 Alberni, through the Ucluelet Elementary School and Ucluelet Secondary School. Health services are provided in town by the Ucluelet Medical Clinic and larger facilities are located in Tofino and Port Alberni; all are operated by the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA).VIHA Central Island Facilities. Retrieved 2011-10-24  Transportation  The Canadian Princess was moored and part of a hotel in Ucluelet, and was a staple of the harbour until it was removed in 2016. Ucluelet has an airport, Tofino Ucluelet Airport, about twenty minutes drive from town. Long Beach Airport is accessible to small passenger planes and the harbour in Ucluelet, Ucluelet Water Aerodrome, is accessible to floatplanes. Coastal fog is a common morning phenomenon in the summer, complicating access by air until the weather clears. Accessing Ucluelet by car is via Highway 4 from Port Alberni. Vehicles are required to use winter tires or carry chains from October 1 to March 31 on this route. Tofino Bus also services Ucluelet from Victoria, Vancouver, Nanaimo and Port Alberni. In the summer, Lady Rose Marine Services operates a ferry service from Port Alberni to Ucluelet and return several times per week.  Tourism  Like its neighbour Tofino, Ucluelet has made the transition from a resource-based economy to a year-round tourism-based economy. The Pacific Rim Visitor Centre is now the second-most-visited Tourism Centre, after Victoria, on Vancouver Island, and on average receives 90,000 visitors from around the world to the Pacific Rim National Park, Ucluelet and Tofino area. Tourist activities include surfing, stand-up paddle board, fishing, whale watching, bear watching, kayaking, canoeing, camping, hiking, biking, swimming, and beachcombing. Storm watching is also an activity during the November to March season.  Activities  The Wild Pacific Trail begins near the mouth of Ucluelet Inlet at Amphitrite Point Lighthouse and travels north along the open Pacific coastline through Big Beach Park to the bike path just outside Ucluelet. The final section will extend the trail to Halfmoon Bay in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.http://www.longbeachmaps.com/wildtrail.html The trail is accessible to all ages and abilities, even wheelchairs in certain areas. No bikes, horses or motorized vehicles are permitted on the park‚Äôs beaches or trails. The hiking trails are designed to let visitors experience the shoreline while preventing damage to the fragile environment. Various marine tours are available including sea kayaking, canoeing in the inlet, whale and wildlife watching. There has been an ongoing interest in sport fishing out of Ucluelet and there are many chartered sports fishing options in town.Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans licensing information Surfing has become a popular activity among tourists and locals alike. In the summer months, surfers gather along Florencia Bay, Wickaninnish Beach and Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Giant Pacific octopus in Ucluelet AquariumIn 2012, the catch-and-release public Ucluelet Aquarium moved into its new building on Main Street by the Ferry Ramp, displaying the local marine biodiversity with a wide variety of fish and invertebrates. Mt. Ozzard, which hosts the Coast Guard Marine Communication and Traffic Services (MCTS) surveillance radar dome and various other communications towers, has a service road that is gated at the bottom. Despite the gate, the road to the summit is accessible to hikers and all-terrain vehicles. The MCTS centre at Amphitrite Point was closed in May 2015 and its services relocated to Prince Rupert.  Festivals and events  Every March, the Pacific Rim Whale Festival is a week of events hosted by Ucluelet, Tofino and the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. With a strong focus on marine life protection education, the event celebrates the annual return of migrating Pacific Grey Whales from their breeding and calving grounds along the Baja Peninsula of Mexico. Community events within the festival include gala dinners, children‚Äôs activities, workshops and live entertainment. Every odd year, Ucluelet hosts a leg of the Van Isle 360. It is a point-to-point race circumnavigating Vancouver Island, sailed in 10 legs. While the participants are in Ucluelet, the community hosts a special salmon barbecue with live music and a send-off event.http://www.vanisle360.com In mid-June, there is the Annual Edge to Edge Marathon. Every year participants from within the community and beyond race from Tofino through the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve to Ucluelet.http://www.edgetoedgemarathon.com The Pacific Rim Summer Festival is held in early July with two weeks of music, word and multi-cultural concerts featuring national and international performers. Nightly concerts are performed at venues in Ucluelet, Tofino and the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.http://www.pacificrimarts.ca The end of July or the last weekend are Ukee Days, a local celebration with several events such as a salmon barbecue on Friday, pancake breakfast and town parade on Saturday and a Ukee Days dance. Also throughout the Full moon weekend of July, the Soundwave music festival happens at the mussel beach campground. It showcases world class DJs, local artists, and live music, and usually 4,000-5,000 people are in attendance.

It has 98,514 inhabitants (2006 estimate) and is located 72 km northwest of Minsk. Located on the Usha River, it has been a settlement since 1388 when it was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was also home to the Cold War facility Maladzyechna air base.  History The fortification on the right bank of the U≈°a was first mentioned in 1388, although it is probable it was erected even before that date. Rectangular earthworks with stone walls 3,5 metres high and 11 metres wide formed the basis of the future castles and military camps formed on that location. The town itself was first mentioned the following year in a document issued by Kaributas, Prince of Severian Novgorod, who on December 16 assured his tributary fidelity to his cousin, King Jogaila and Jadwiga of Poland. In 1501 the place was donated by King Sigismund I the Old to certain Michael of Mstislav, on the condition that the latter provided a safe river passage for the nobles and hunters dwelling in the area. The privilege was further confirmed on July 12, 1511 After Michael's heirless death, the locality passed through different hands until finally in 1567 it was acquired by Prince Nastasi Zbaraski, the voivod of Trakai. In 1568, that is the following year, a battle took place in the vicinity of the castle, in which the 40,000 men strong army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth defeated the forces of Muscovy. In 1617 it was bought by Lew Sapieha, the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania. Around that time the village had 1000 inhabitants. On August 20, 1631 Sapieha sold it to Stanis≈Çaw Siemiott, the chamberlain of Samogitia, who then divided the villages surrounding Maladzieƒçna among his sons. Following a testament conflict between the descendants of Siemiott and Aleksander Gosiewski, the Voivod of Smolensk, the town remained a property of the Gosiewski family. During their ownership of Maladzieƒçna the fortifications were extended and strengthened significantly by addition of several bastions. Around that time Maladzieƒçna started to be referred to as a town, even though it was officially a village and was not granted with a city charter. Nevertheless, it served as a centre of trade and commerce for the surrounding villages and also gained significant profits from transit between Lithuania and Poland. In 1708 the castle was one of the headquarters of the Swedish Army of King Charles XII of Sweden, which led to its partial devastation in the effect of a battle between the Swedes and the Russian forces. Town hall and a monument to Lenin On September 18, 1711 Bishop Bogus≈Çaw Gosiewski, sold the town to the mighty Ogi≈Ñski family. Among the owners of the area were Kazimierz Ogi≈Ñski and Tadeusz Ogi≈Ñski, the Castellan of Trakai (Lithuania). The Ogi≈Ñski family became the main benefactors of the area, as they made it one of the main centres of their domain. They erected a new, classicist palace with notable frescoes, as well as a late renaissance church. It was also them to ask the king Sigismund II Augustus to grant the town with a city charter. Although it was not granted, in 1730 the monarch granted the town with the privilege of organization of two fairs a year and 2 markets every week. In mid-18th century the Ogi≈Ñski's also founded a monastery of the Trinitaries there. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Maladzieƒçna was part of Minsk Voivodeship. In 1793, Maladzieƒçna was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. The palace was abandoned soon afterwards. The castle was also neglected. During the final stages of Napoleon's invasion of Russia it was there that the Grande Arm√©e made its last stand in former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In early November 1812 Napoleon Bonaparte gave his last orders to his marshals there, after which he left for Vilnius. On November 21 of that year the Polish-born Russian general Yefim Chaplits arrived at the French camp there and defeated the already-routed French forces led by Marshal Victor. In the effect of the fights the town was completely demolished, as were the monastery and the castle. Because of that, in mid-19th century the town had not more than 500 inhabitants. It was not until the later part of the century that the town started to gradually recover. In 1864 a Russian-language school was opened there and in 1871 an Orthodox church of Intercession of Our Most Holy Lady was built at the main town square. In 1873 it was linked to the world by the Minsk‚ÄìVilna railway, which sparked a period of economic recovery of the entire region. In early 20th century an additional rail line was opened, linking Saint Petersburg and Polotsk with Lida and Siedlce. This made the town a major railway junction and attracted many new settlers, in large part Jewish. By the outbreak of World War I the town had already over 2,000 inhabitants. During the war, the town was the headquarters of the Russian 10th Army of the Western Front. Between February and December 1918 it was under German occupation, but was then seized by the Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War. On July 4, 1919 the town was captured by the Polish Army units led by Gen. Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki, during their advance towards Minsk. However, the town was again held by the Russian forces in the course of the Polish-Bolshevik War between 12 July 1920 and 12 October 1920. Following the Riga Peace Treaty it was transferred to the Second Polish Republic, but the border between Poland and the Soviet Union was only 30 kilometres to the east, which cut Mo≈Çodeczno, as the town was known in Polish, from much of its economical background. To counter the threat of economic decline, became a capital of separate powiat within the Wilno Voivodship on January 1, 1926 and on April 26, 1929 the town was granted with city rights. On September 17 1939, Maladzieƒçna was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. On 4 December 1939, Maladzieƒçna became a part of the newly formed Vileyka Voblast of the Byelorussian SSR. The NKVD expropriated the local school for teachers and set up one of its concentration camps there. From 25 June 1941 until 5 July 1944, Maladzieƒçna was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. The new German authorities sent most of the local Jewish inhabitants to the German concentration camps throughout occupied Europe. In addition, the German Wehrmacht has set up the infamous Stalag 342 for the Soviet prisoners of war there, in which at least 30,000 people were killed. On 5 July 1944, the advancing Red Army liberated Maladzieƒçna in the course of the Vilnius Offensive. The town resumed its status as a part of the Byelorussian SSR. The heavy damage that Vileyka suffered during the war made it unsuitable to perform the role of the administrative centre, thus Maladzyechna, which was located only 20 kilometres away from Vileyka, became the new administrative centre when the civilian control was restored in the BSSR on 20 September 1944. Maladzyechna Voblast also survived the 1954 reform which halved the amount of Voblasts in the BSSR, but on 20 January 1960, the Voblast was disestablished, and the town of Maladzyechna became part of the modern Minsk Voblast, in which it remains today as part of the Republic of Belarus.

Map showing almost complete British control of the Cape to Cairo route, 1914 The Cape to Cairo Road or Pan-African Highway, sometimes called the Great North Road in sub-Saharan Africa, was a proposed road that would stretch the length of Africa, from Cape Town to Cairo, through the Cape to Cairo Red Line of British colonies. The proposal was similar to the Cape to Cairo Railway, another proposed infrastructure project through the same colonies. Neither were completed before British colonial rule ended in the colonies. In the 1980s the plan was revived with modifications as the Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway, known as Trans-African Highway 4, in the transcontinental road network being developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the African Development Bank (ADB), and the African Union, as part of the Trans- African Highway network. History From about 1890, some in the British Empire envisioned a road that would stretch across the continent from south to north, running through the British colonies of the time, such as the Union of South Africa, Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Kenya, Sudan and Egypt. The road would create cohesion between the British colonies of Africa, it was thought, and give Britain the most important and dominant political and economic influence over the continent, securing its position as a global colonial power. The road would also link some of the most important cities on the continent, including Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Harare (then Salisbury), Lusaka (the main street through the centre of Lusaka was part of this route and is how it got its name, Cairo Road), Nairobi, Khartoum and Cairo. One of the main proponents of the route was Cecil John Rhodes, though his preference was for a railway. German East Africa (Tanganyika, now Tanzania) was a gap in the British territories, but Rhodes, in particular, felt that Germany ought to be a natural ally. Shortly before his death he had persuaded the German Kaiser to allow access through his colony for the Cape to Cairo telegraph line (which was built as far north as Ujiji but never completed). In 1918 Tanganyika became British and the gap in territories was filled. One of the biggest problems was the decline of the Empire and fragmentation of the British colonies. Even though Egypt became independent in 1922, British influence there was strong enough for Cairo to be viewed as part of the British sphere of interest, and the idea of a road continued. After Egypt, Sudan was the next to become independent in 1956, putting an end to the colonial motivation of the dream. France had a rival strategy in the late 1890s to link its colonies from west to east across the continent, Senegal to Djibouti. Southern Sudan and Ethiopia were in the way, but France sent expeditions in 1897 to establish a protectorate in southern Sudan and to find a route across Ethiopia. The scheme foundered when a British flotilla on the Nile confronted the French expedition at the point of intersection between the French and British routes, leading to the Fashoda Incident and eventual diplomatic defeat for France. The first known attempt to drive a vehicle from Cape Town to Cairo was by a Captain Kelsey in 1913-14 but this came to an untimely end when he was killed by a leopard in Rhodesia. The first successful journey was Court Treatt expedition of 1924 led by Major Chaplin Court Treatt and described by his wife Stella Court Treatt in Cape to Cairo (1927), which drove two Crossley light trucks leaving Cape Town on 23 September 1924 and arriving in Cairo on 24 January 1926. The original route today Starting from the south, the first section of the road that runs through South Africa is called the N1, linking Cape Town in the south with Beit Bridge on the Limpopo River between South Africa and Zimbabwe. It passes through Johannesburg and Pretoria. There are numerous alternative routes in South Africa, including a route through Mahikeng and Gaborone, as an alternative to reach Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, the road continues as the Chirundu-Beitbridge Regional Road Corridor, which consists of the A4 road (R1 road) to Harare and the A1 road (R3 road) to Chirundu Border Post on the Zambezi River thereafter, continuing as the T2 Road in Zambia to Lusaka. An alternative route is the A6 and A8 roads, which connect the South African Border with the Zambian Border at Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River via Bulawayo. The alternative route continues as the T1 Road in Zambia towards Lusaka. From Lusaka, Zambia's Great North Road continues the route to Tanzania as the T2 Road. (No alternative route; Also known as the Tanzam Highway and consisting of a right turn at Kapiri Mposhi towards Tanzania) In Tanzania there are a number of roads could be deemed to be part of the route, the clear definitions and markings that are characteristic of the Pan-African Highway do not apply here. Most would consider it to be the road from Tunduma on the Tanzania-Zambia border, through Morogoro to the Arusha turnoff, and north through Dodoma to Arusha, then to Nairobi in Kenya. This route is now all paved. There was a marker in the 1930s in Arusha, Tanzania, to indicate the midpoint of the road. The entire route through Tanzania from Tunduma on the Zambian Border to the Kenya Border is designated as the A104 Road. Kenya has a tarred highway to its border with Sudan but the roads in southern Sudan are very poor and made frequently impassable, so that even without the conflicts that have afflicted Sudan, the route through Ethiopia is generally preferred by overland travellers. The route from Isiolo in Kenya to Moyale on the Ethiopian border through the northern Kenyan desert has sometimes been dangerous due to bandits, but is now paved. Through Ethiopia the route is tarred but some sections may have deteriorated severely. A paved road from Lake Tana to Gedaref takes the route into Sudan. The most difficult section in the whole Cape to Cairo journey was across the Nubian Desert in northern Sudan between Atbara and Wadi Halfa, but this has been bypassed by a paved road on the west side of the Nile, Dongola- Abu Simbel Junction-Aswan.https://www.horizonsunlimited.com/hubb/north- africa/sudan-egypt-via-argeen-west-91827 Tarred highways continue the route to Cairo. As a result, the Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway is fully paved. Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway The Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway follows much of the Cape-to-Cairo Road's route but it has a few differences. Firstly, the Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway passes through Addis Ababa, Ethiopia while the Cape-to-Cairo Road goes directly through South Sudan from Kenya. Secondly, the Cairo‚ÄìCape Town Highway passes through Livingstone (Victoria Falls), Bulawayo, Francistown and Gaborone and not through Harare, Pretoria and Johannesburg. This new route has a length of 10,228 km. As South Sudan has a paved link to its border with Kenya, ultimately a route through southern Sudan via Khartoum and South Sudan may provide a shorter alternative to the Ethiopian route. The modern revival of the plan occurred in the 1980s. South Africa was not originally included in the route which was first planned in the Apartheid era, but it is now recognized that it would continue into that country. The consultants' report suggested Pretoria as end, which seems somewhat arbitrary and as a major port, Cape Town, is regarded as the southern end of regional highways in Southern African Development Community countries. The highway may be referred to in documents as the Cairo‚ÄìGaborone Highway or Cairo‚ÄìPretoria Highway. As the Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through south-eastern Botswana, the route does not pass through Pretoria as the Cape-to-Cairo Road does. After Gaborone, the road proceeds into the western side of South Africa. Modern route today The stretch of highway between Dongola and Wadi Halfa in Northern Sudan and the Egypt-Sudan border are now accessible by road through the Qastal-Ashkeet border post. Between Wad Madani in Sudan and Wereta in Ethiopia, the route is shared with the Ndjamena-Djibouti Highway. The Ethiopian section is all tarmac road, although much of the Ethiopian section passes through mountainous terrain and parts of the road may be hazardous as a result. In northern Kenya the section has been hazardous due to the activities of armed bandits. The road has been dubbed \\"Hell's Road\\" by overland travellers, but it is completely paved. The road section through Babati and Dodoma (the A104 Road) in central Tanzania has been completely paved, and passable throughout most of the year, and the alternative paved eastern route to Iringa via Moshi, Korogwe, Chalinze and Morogoro may also be considered to have a better claim to be part of the highway. Between Chalinze in Tanzania and Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia via Iringa, Tunduma & Mpika, the highway uses an important regional route, the Tanzam Highway, also called the northern section of the Great North Road (T2 Road) in Zambia. This highway used to have the distinction of being the only link between any of Africa's five major regions which is paved, linking East Africa to Southern Africa. It is the most used of any such inter- regional road on the continent. From Kapiri Mposhi, the road is completely paved, mostly in good condition and continues southwards as the T2 Road (still called Great North Road), through Kabwe and Lusaka to the Kafue River Bridge, where it becomes the south-westerly Lusaka-Livingstone road, through Mazabuka and Choma to Livingstone and the Victoria Falls, where the road crosses the Zambezi River and enters Zimbabwe. The section from Kapiri Mposhi to the beginning of the Lusaka-Livingstone Road south of Kafue is shared with the Beira-Lobito Highway. The road section through Zimbabwe is paved, firstly going south-east from Victoria Falls to Bulawayo as the A8 Road, then shifting south-west as the A7 Road, crossing the border with Botswana (Ramokgwebana River), to the city of Francistown. The road section through Botswana is paved, going from the border with Zimbabwe as one road (the A1 Road) through Francistown, Palapye, Gaborone and Lobatse to the border with South Africa. In South Africa, the road is completely paved, with the entire route through the country being part of the National Roads in South Africa (System of highways). After entering South Africa, the Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Mahikeng, Warrenton, Kimberley and Beaufort West to end in the vicinity of Cape Town. From Mahikeng to Warrenton, it uses the N18 Route, before using the N12 Route from Warrenton to Beaufort West and becoming the N1 Route for the remainder of the route to Cape Town.

The series aired 16 episodes in a single season as part of the umbrella series The Krofft Supershow. During the second season, it was dropped, along with Dr. Shrinker. When later syndicated in the package \\"Krofft Super Stars\\" and released on home video, the 16 segments, which were each about 12 minutes long, were combined into eight episodes.  Premise  The program followed the crime-fighting exploits of female caped crusader Electra Woman (played by Deidre Hall) and her teen sidekick Dyna Girl (Judy Strangis), who worked in their off-time as reporters for Newsmaker Magazine (the full real names of the two were never revealed in any of the installments, although their first names were Lori and Judy, respectively). In each episode, the duo would don skintight spandex in a bright flash of light called an \\"Electra-Change,\\" get into the \\"ElectraCar,\\" and use an array of technically advanced gadgets to thwart an eclectic collection of supervillains.

They could function as two-way radios with video capabilities; they also served a variety of other specialized functions, which allowed the duo to escape various traps devised by their enemies. With the addition of special cartridge attachments, the ElectraComs were additionally seen to perform the following functions on the show: * Direct-A-Scan - navigates the title characters through buildings to the exact location of the villain. * Electra-Change - allows the title characters to change from their civilian clothing to the costumes of their super-powered alter-egos instantaneously. * Electra-Beam - emits a focused kinetic beam of energy that can \\"push\\" or \\"pull\\" objects much like a tractor or pressor beam. * Electra-Degravitate - allows the title characters to defy gravity for very short distances so that they can circumvent obstacles in their path or levitate themselves to higher ground. * Electra-Force - apparently breaks steel bars (was not available the one time it was attempted). * Electra-Force Shield - is essentially a force field used to detain villains once they have been caught. The shield was also used defensively as a protective barrier that can shield against physical and energy attacks. * Electra-Freeze - lowers the temperature of the target to below freezing. * Electra-G - increases the weight of the target. * Electra- Split - replicates target to create a copy.

Episodes  Other adaptations = Unaired WB television pilot  The WB Television Network commissioned a pilot for a new version of the show in 2001 starring Markie Post as Electra Woman and Anne Stedman as Dyna Girl. The new series was written in the form of a cynical parody of the original show - and the superhero genre in general. It was set 25 years after the original series, with a retired Electra Woman brought back into action by a fan who ends up becoming the new Dyna Girl. The pilot portrayed Electra Woman as a disillusioned, bitter, sexually promiscuous, chain smoking alcoholic, much in contrast to the character's original portrayal. In the pilot, Electra Woman had been married and divorced since the end of the original series, her husband having left her for the original Dyna Girl, taking her bank account and car and leaving her as trailer trash. Although the pilot was shot, the series was not picked up. The pilot omits the character of Frank Heflin, but includes an in-joke reference to Norman Alden, who had portrayed him in the original. The university's alumni function is attended by Aquaman, whose character voice Alden had provided on the Super Friends animated series.

The War Service of Sherlock Holmes\\", later titled \\"His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes\\", is one of 56 short stories about Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was first published in September 1917 in Strand Magazine, and, amongst six other stories, was collected in an anthology titled His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes. The narration is in the third person, instead of the first person narration usually provided by the character of Dr. Watson, and it is a spy story, rather than a detective mystery. Due to its portrayal of British and German spies, its publication during the First World War and its patriotic themes, the story has been interpreted as a propaganda tool intended to boost morale for British readers. Synopsis Arthur Conan Doyle did his part to raise wartime morale by continuing to provide The Strand Magazine with the public's favoured reading material. The vol. 65, no. 321, September 1917 issue contained the Holmes story \\"His Last Bow.\\" On the eve of the First World War, the German agent Von Bork is getting ready to leave England with his vast collection of intelligence, gathered over a four-year period. His wife and household have already left Harwich for Flushing in the Netherlands, leaving only him and his elderly housekeeper. Von Bork's associate, Baron von Herling, is impressed by his acquisition of vital British military secrets, and tells Von Bork that he will be received in Berlin as a hero. Von Bork says that he is waiting for one last transaction with his Irish-American informant, Altamont, who will arrive shortly with a rich treasure: naval signals. Von Herling leaves just before Altamont arrives. Von Bork's housekeeper has turned her light off and retired. Altamont shows Von Bork a package. Altamont disparages Von Bork's safe, but Von Bork proudly says that its construction and the double combination lock make it impenetrable. He tells Altamont that the combination is \\"August 1914\\". Altamont, mentioning cases in which several German informants have ended up in prison, is distrustful of Von Bork and refuses to deliver the naval codes until he receives payment. Von Bork refuses to pay until he has examined Altamont's intelligence data. Altamont hands him the package. Von Bork finds that it is a book titled Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, hardly what he expected. Even less expected is the chloroform-soaked rag that is held in his face by Altamont a moment later. Altamont is actually Sherlock Holmes in disguise, and the chauffeur who brought him is Dr. Watson. Now past their heyday, they have nonetheless caught several spies (Holmes is actually responsible for the imprisoned agents of whom \\"Altamont\\" spoke), and fed the Germans some thoroughly untrustworthy intelligence. Holmes had retired from detective work, spending his days beekeeping in the countryside, but returned after the Foreign Minister and the Premier came to him. Holmes has been on this case for two years, and it has taken him to Chicago, Buffalo, and Ireland, where he learnt to play the part of a bitter Irish-American, even gaining the credentials of a member of a secret society. He identified the security leak through which British secrets were reaching the Germans, and then set out to apprehend the receiving agents themselves. The housekeeper was one of Holmes' agents: the light that she switched off was the signal to Holmes and Watson that the coast was clear. Holmes and Watson take Von Bork and the evidence to Scotland Yard. In reference to the impending War, Holmes says, \\"There's an east wind coming, Watson.\\" Watson misinterprets the meaning of the words and says, \\"I think not, Holmes. It is very warm\\", to which Holmes replies: Publication history \\"His Last Bow\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September 1917, and in the US in Collier's in the same month.Smith (2014), p. 180. The story was published with three illustrations by Alfred Gilbert in the Strand, and with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's.Cawthorne (2011), p. 149. It was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151. Legacy The story is the last chronological instalment of the series. The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, set before the story, was published later. Holmes' patriotic passage has been widely quoted, and was later used in the final scene of the Basil Rathbone film Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942), loosely based on \\"His Last Bow\\", though set during World War II. The events leading up to and beyond this story were described in Sherlock Holmes and the Railway Maniac (1994, ), by Barrie Roberts. The end of Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel The Canary Trainer ties into \\"His Last Bow\\", with Edward Grey and H. H. Asquith approaching Holmes to request he come out of retirement to investigate a man named Von Bork. Ten Years Beyond Baker Street by Cay Van Ash is set during Holmes's undercover search for Von Bork; it tells how he divides his time between his counter-espionage task and a search for Sir Denis Nayland Smith, believed to have been kidnapped by Fu Manchu; thus, Van Ash combines the worlds created by Conan Doyle and Sax Rohmer. The story is continued in Robert Ryan's 2015 novel A Study in Murder, the third in his \\"Dr Watson\\" detective series, in which Von Bork torments Dr Watson, now a prisoner of war in Germany, and arranges for him to be exchanged for Sherlock Holmes so that he can exact his revenge. Adaptations=Film and television A silent short film based on the story was released in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. Eille Norwood played Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis played Dr. Watson. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled \\"The Secret Safe\\", aired in 2001. Radio \\"His Last Bow\\" was dramatised by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 12 October 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 48. The story was adapted for BBC radio in 1969 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. \\"His Last Bow\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Norman Rodway as Stamford, Michael Cochrane as Captain Kell, and Preston Lockwood as H. H. Asquith. In 2015, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

It was part of Operation Cartwheel, the Allied strategy in the South Pacific to isolate the Japanese base around Rabaul. The campaign took place in the New Georgia group of islands, in the central Solomon Islands and followed the Allied capture of the Russell Islands. The main fighting took place on New Georgia island itself, although significant actions also took place around the island chain throughout the campaign. The campaign began on 30 June 1943, when US troops carried out landings in the Kula Gulf, in the north of New Georgia island, and around the Munda area on the western coast. In addition, smaller landings were undertaken at Viru Harbor on the southern coast of the island, Wickham Anchorage on Vangunu Island, and on Rendova. In the north, several actions were fought around Enogai and Bairoko throughout July, while in the west, the main US objective was the Japanese airfield on Munda Point. Stubborn defense by the Japanese delayed the US advance on Munda and the Japanese mounted a strong counterattack before US force eventually captured Munda Point in early August. Elsewhere, further actions took place on Arundel Island in August and September after Japanese forces withdrew there after the fighting around Munda Point. A large number of Japanese troops concentrated on Kolombangara late in the campaign, but were bypassed by US troops who landed on Vella Lavella in mid-August and were later reinforced by New Zealand troops. The campaign ended on 7 October 1943 when the last Japanese troops were withdrawn from Vella Lavella, finalizing the Allied capture of the islands. A series of naval actions also took place in conjunction with the fighting on land, including actions in the Kula Gulf, off Kolombangara, in the Vella Gulf, off Horaniu and off Vella Lavella. Background Map showing the area in which Operation Cartwheel took place, with New Guinea in the west and the New Georgias highlighted The Japanese had captured New Georgia in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point which began operations in December 1942 to support the Guadalcanal offensives. As it became clear at the end of 1942 that they could not hold Guadalcanal, the Japanese commanders guessed that the Allies would move toward the Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain, and that the central Solomon Islands were logical steps on the way.Lofgren, Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, p. 8 The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) believed that holding the Solomon Islands would be ultimately unsuccessful and that it would be better to wait for an Allied attack on Bougainville which would be much less costly to supply and reinforce. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) preferred to delay the Allied advance for as long as possible by maintaining a distant line of defense. With no effective central command, the two Japanese services implemented their own plans: the navy assumed responsibility for the defense of the central Solomons and the army for the northern Solomons.Lofgren, Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, p. 9 In early 1943, Japanese defenses were prepared against possible Allied landings on New Georgia, Kolombangara and Santa Isabel. By June 1943, there were 10,500 troops on New Georgia and 9,000 on Kolombangara, all under the command of General Minoru (Noboru) Sasaki, well dug in and waiting for an Allied attack.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 97Lofgren, Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, pp. 9 & 25 Allied planning=Choice of New Georgia By early 1943, some Allied leaders had wanted to focus on capturing Rabaul, but Japanese strength there and lack of landing craft meant that such an operation was not practical in 1943. Instead, on the initiative of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, a plan known as Operation Cartwheel was developed, which proposed to envelop and cut off Rabaul without capturing it, by simultaneous offensives in the Territory of New Guinea and northward through the Solomon Islands.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 20‚Äì26; 225 The Allied base at Guadalcanal continued to suffer from Japanese bombing raids even after the island was declared secured on 9 February 1943. The Japanese airfield at Munda made these raids easier by giving Japanese planes a convenient place to refuel on the way to and from their main base at Rabaul. The Allies attempted to neutralize Munda with repeated bombing raids and naval shelling, but the Japanese were always able to repair the airfield in short order.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 90 The Allied command thus determined that Munda had to be captured by ground troops. Since the New Georgias lay within the South Pacific Area, the operation would be the responsibility of Admiral William F. Halsey,Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 67 Commander South Pacific Force (renamed US Third Fleet on 15 March 1943), headquartered at Noum√©a on New Caledonia. Lofgren, Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, p. 25 US forces committed to capturing Munda totaled 32,000 Army personnel and 1,700 Marines.Potter, Nimitz, p. 245 Forces allocated to capturing Vella Lavella totaled 9,588, of which 5,888 were US servicemen and 3,700 were New Zealanders.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 176Gillespie, The Pacific, p. 128 Capture of the Russells Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, Commander South Pacific Amphibious Forces The Russell Island group, lying between Guadalcanal and the New Georgia group, had served as a troop staging base for the Japanese during the fight for Guadalcanal, and Admiral Halsey determined to capture it in preparation for the main action in the New Georgias. In early February, he instructed Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, formerly his Deputy Commander and now his Commander Amphibious Force, to undertake Operation Cleanslate.Miller Guadalcanal: The First Offensive, pp. 351‚Äì356 Beginning 21 February, Admiral Turner landed the US Army 43rd Infantry Division under Major General John H. Hester and the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge on the Russells, a total of approximately 9,000 troops and their equipment. These landings were totally unopposed because, unbeknownst to the Allies, the Japanese had evacuated the Russells soon after leaving Guadalcanal. In fact, the men landing on nearby Banika Island were greeted by two coastwatchers with the offer of a cup of tea.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 21 Preliminaries to the New Georgia landings Allied landings in the New Georgias Alarmed that the Allies were working their way up the Solomons chain, the Japanese bombed the new American base in the Russells and began strengthening their own airfields at Munda and at nearby Vila on Kolombangara Island. In turn, the Americans attempted to subdue Munda field with naval gunfire with limited success.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 106‚Äì107 During the course of one of these overnight bombardment sorties, on the night of 6‚Äì7 March 1943, an American force consisting of three light cruisers and three destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral A. Stanton Merrill encountered two Japanese destroyers as they were returning to the Kula Gulf from delivering food and supplies to the garrison at Vila. In the ensuing action, known as the Battle of Blackett Strait, both Japanese destroyers were sunk.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 107‚Äì110 The Americans next attempted to interdict the Japanese supply lanes by mining the ocean approaches to Vila and Munda. This proved as ineffective as bombardment had been, since the Japanese were able to sweep up the mines readily.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 110‚Äì116 The Allies had plenty of time to plan Operation Toenails, as the invasion of the New Georgias was called. The plan called for simultaneous landings on 30 June at four places. From southeast to northwest, these were: (1) Wickham Anchorage on the southeast coast of Vangunu Island; (2) Segi Point on the southeastern tip of New Georgia; (3) Viru Harbor on the southwest coast of New Georgia, just a few miles up from Segi; and (4) Rendova Harbor on Rendova Island just across Blanche Channel from Munda, placing the latter Japanese base well within range of land-based artillery.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 139 During the entire New Georgia campaign, the resolution and resourcefulness of the British Commonwealth coastwatchers proved invaluable to the Allied cause. District Officer Donald Gilbert Kennedy, a New Zealander, set the tone in a message he delivered to every native village when occupation by the Japanese was imminent: \\"These islands are British and they are to remain British. The government is not leaving. Even if the Japanese come, we shall stay with you and in the end they will be driven out.\\" In the event, it was the prospect of District Officer Kennedy being killed or captured that led Admiral Turner to move up the first Allied landings by nine days. He sent two companies of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion to capture Segi Point on the morning of 21 June, where Kennedy and his native comrades were rescued.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 141 Conquest of New Georgia island=Initial landings: 30 June ‚Äì 2 July American forces landing on Rendova Island A force consisting of portions of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion and the 103rd Infantry Regiment landed at Oloana Bay on the south coast of Vangunu Island on 30 June. From there they marched overland to Vura village which overlooked Wickham Anchorage, the first of the objectives of the original Allied plan. By 12 July, Vura was secured and garrisoned.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 46‚Äì51 Meanwhile, the remainder of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion captured Viru Harbor, supported by dive bombers, on 30 June, after advancing overland from Lambeti Plantation. They had moved to the plantation by boat on 27 June from Segi Point, having been dispatched there on 21 June during a preliminary operation. Another company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment relieved the Marines in the harbor on 4 July, having landed at Segi Point on 30 June when the Marines' advance had been delayed.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 83‚Äì85 The landings in the Munda area were the most important of the four; the initial phase of this part of the operation was the capture of Rendova, commanded by Admiral Turner. A total of 6,000 soldiers, sailors and marines of the US Army's 172nd Infantry Regiment, the 9th Marine Defense Battalion, and the Navy's 24th NCB landed at Rendova Harbor early on 30 June while Companies A and B of the 169th Infantry Regiment along with the New Zealand-trained and led commando unit of 130 South Pacific islanders took three strategic islets in the Blanche Channel opposite Munda.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 54‚Äì57Larsen, Pacific Commandos, pp. 9 & 108 Rendova, Wickham Anchorage and Viru Harbor were developed into staging areas for the main event, the siege of Munda, while Segi Point was developed into an airfield.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 84‚Äì85 The small Japanese garrison on Rendova was quickly overwhelmed but the island was subjected to heavy attack by Japanese aircraft over the following days. The Marines on Rendova quickly built artillery emplacements from which they could shell Munda airfield and support the operations during July and August to capture of Munda airfield.Hammel, Munda Trail, pp. 69‚Äì78Stille, The Solomons 1943‚Äì44, pp. 42‚Äì44, 52‚Äì53 On 2 July, the Americans were ready to make a landing in the Munda area on the New Georgia mainland. Laiana beach was closest, being only from Munda, but as it was heavily defended, it was rejected in favor of Zanana beach, more than farther east. Zanana would prove to be an unfortunate choice from an Allied perspective.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 92, footnote 27Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 177 The crossing was undertaken in daylight by elements from two regiments in the afternoon of 2 July; a small perimeter was established around Zanana and defenses built up before the advance westwards towards Munda Point began several days later.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 92‚Äì94. Landings in Kula Gulf Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge on New Georgia. Halsey's counterparts at Rabaul, Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka and Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura, had no intention of allowing New Georgia to fall the way Guadalcanal had. They loaded 4,000 troops on destroyers, brought them down The Slot on the night of 4‚Äì5 July and landed them at Vila on the southeast coast of Kolombangara Island.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 156 From there, the men would be ferried across Kula Gulf on barges to Bairoko on the northwest coast of New Georgia, before moving along eight-mile jungle trail to Munda.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, Map p. 100 & pp. 104‚Äì105 The Allies also carried out an amphibious operation in Kula Gulf that night. Admiral Halsey had dispatched transports carrying 4,600 troops consisting of Marine raiders and two US Army battalions under Colonel Liversedge to Rice Anchorage on the northwest coast of New Georgia.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabual, pp. 119‚Äì121 A force of three light cruisers and four destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth covered the troopships. One of Ainsworth's destroyers was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese as the latter were retiring up the Gulf from their reinforcement mission to Vila.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 156‚Äì158 Liversedge's men were tasked with moving down the coast and capturing Bairoko, thereby interdicting the trailhead used by the Japanese to reinforce Munda. They were successfully landed at dawn, but found the terrain difficult and advanced slowly inland over the course of several days.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 176 The night (5‚Äì6 July) after the Kula Gulf landings, the opposing naval forces engaged in a full-scale battle in the waters northeast of Kolombangara Island, an action that came to be called the Battle of Kula Gulf. The Americans lost a light cruiser while the Japanese lost two destroyers.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 99Prados, Combined Fleet Decoded, p. 491 In the north, after advancing from Rice Anchorage, US forces occupied Triri on 7‚Äì8 July. A 400-strong Japanese force launched a counterattack on 8 July against Triri, which initially made some gains before it was checked by a flanking move. Following this, US troops captured Enogai at the mouth of the inlet on 10‚Äì11 July, before moving to establish a block along the Munda‚ÄìBairoko trail.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 123‚Äì130 Advance from Zanana and capture of Munda Initial drive towards Munda The US advance from Zanana to Munda was completely stymied, hampered by difficult terrain, supply problems and low morale.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 106‚Äì115 General Hester tried to break the stalemate by sending the 172nd Infantry Regiment around to the north to take the Japanese position in the rear, while the 169th Infantry Regiment continued the frontal assault, but this effort was checked by Sasaki.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 177 As a result, the US advance on New Georgia stalled in both the north and the south. The Japanese brought reinforcements by barge from Vila to Bairoko, and 1,200 more troops were loaded onto four destroyer-transports at Rabaul and sent down to be landed at Vila on the night of 12‚Äì13 July. These ships were escorted by a light cruiser and five destroyers. Admiral Ainsworth was sent to intercept this flotilla with three light cruisers and ten destroyers. He encountered the Japanese force in The Slot in the waters north of Kolombangara Island and in the ensuing Battle of Kolombangara one US destroyer and one Japanese light cruiser were sunk.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 180‚Äì182 Siege and capture of Munda Major General Oscar W. Griswold, commander XIV Corps and General Hester's immediate superior, visited New Georgia in mid-July and assessed the situation as dire. He radioed Halsey at Noum√©a that at least another division was needed to break the stalemate.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 198 Lieutenant General Millard F. Harmon, of the United States Army Air Forces, was sent to confirm the situation. After an investigation, Harmon gave field command to Griswold so that Hester could concentrate on leading his own division. At the same time, a long-anticipated change in naval command took place with Rear Admiral Theodore Stark Wilkinson taking over leadership of the amphibious forces from Admiral Turner on 15 July.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 77 General Sasaki initially took advantage of the disorder on the American side. The Japanese learned to apply close assault tactics against American tanks, rendering armor even less effective in the jungle than usual. Meanwhile, the inexperienced, hungry and fatigued US soldiers' nerves began to fray and they began to lose their fire discipline.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 199 On the night of 17 July, the Japanese launched a strong counterattack and succeeded in overrunning the command post of the 43rd Division near Zanana. Eventually, however, Sasaki's troops became sick and exhausted; also, he had lost communications with Rabaul.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 200‚Äì206 US forces, bolstered by the arrival of the 37th Infantry Division, subsequently launched a corps-level offensive under Griswold aimed at capturing Munda Point.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 137 Sasaki ordered a retreat from the Munda area on 3 August. General Griswold had his men sweep around Munda to the northwest and on 5 August plastered the remaining Japanese with artillery fire. That day, the Americans moved unopposed into Munda, finally achieving the campaign's most important goal. Capture of Bairoko Approach to Bairoko On the northern front, Colonel Liversedge's Marines consolidated their position around Enogai after 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops occupied the blocking position. This was subsequently abandoned on 17 July and the soldiers returned to Triri.Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 131‚Äì133 He had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and made plans to capture Bairoko village, on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 202 His Army detachment was to attack the village from the southeast while his Marines converged from the northeast, a classic pincer movement. But the Japanese defensive positions were well designed, and had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;Shaw & Kane, Isolation of Rabaul, pp. 134‚Äì135 as a result, neither force made any progress, and US casualties began to mount. Just before dawn on 22 July, Liversedge called for air strikes to cover his withdrawal. With a view to compensating for failures in land-based air cover following previous such requests, what followed was the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign so far.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 105‚Äì108 Beginning 3 August, Liversedge tried again, first establishing a battalion of the 148th Infantry Regiment at a blocking position on the Munda trail. Two days later he relieved these men with a combined Army/Marine force and moved the 148th to a dominant position overlooking the entire area. On 10 August, Liversedge picked up another US battalion and renewed the direct attack on Bairoko.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 109 At the same time, two regiments from the 25th Infantry Division, sent to New Georgia as reinforcements, advanced on Bairoko from Munda Point mopping up after the capture of Munda airfield.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 167‚Äì171 After two more grueling weeks, the Americans entered Bairoko unopposed on 24 August. Securing New Georgia Actions in western New Georgia Admiral Kusaka and General Imamura at Rabaul made a final, disastrous attempt to reinforce General Sasaki. Under the protection of a single destroyer, 940 troops and 700 naval personnel were loaded aboard three destroyer-transports and sent down under the command of Rear Admiral Kaju Sugiura to Kolombangara on the night of 6‚Äì7 August. Admiral Wilkinson, anticipating such a movement that night, sent a force of six destroyers under Commander Frederick Moosbrugger to intercept them.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 118 In the resulting Battle of Vella Gulf, fought in the waters northwest of Kolombangara, the American destroyers took the Japanese completely by surprise. The three ships carrying passengers were torpedoed and sunk, and the remaining escort ship did not linger to search for survivors.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 118‚Äì120 Following this major reversal, General Sasaki moved his headquarters to Kolombangara on 8‚Äì9 August, leaving behind a token force to defend the west coast of New Georgia. His mission now was simply to hold the remaining islands of the New Georgia group as long as possible, giving the Japanese a chance to reinforce the northern Solomons. US Army forces moved along the west coast of New Georgia, wiping out the 200 Japanese remaining in the Zieta area. Elements of the 169th and 172nd Infantry Regiments captured Baanga islet on 20‚Äì21 August, silencing the Japanese artillery that had been shelling Munda. Despite the proximity of U.S. patrols, the last Japanese troops on New Georgia were moved by barge from Bairoko Harbor over to Kolombangara on the night of 23 August. This marked the end of ground combat on New Georgia.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 121‚Äì122Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 172 Outlying islands=Arundel General Sasaki played his delaying role to the hilt. When the US 172nd Infantry Regiment landed on Arundel Island, just west of New Georgia, on 27 August, he allowed them to come ashore unopposed and establish a beachhead. Just as the Americans were feeling the occupation would be easy, Sasaki counterattacked in multiple places, tying the Americans down and forcing them to call for reinforcements. He carried out a particularly determined attack on 15 September, bringing the whole Allied effort on Arundel to a halt, and with far fewer troops than his opponents. General Griswold ordered a full-scale effort, including Marine Corps tanks, to drive the Japanese off the island. After vicious fighting on 17 and 18 September, the Japanese abandoned Arundel for good on the night of 20‚Äì21 September.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, pp. 124‚Äì128  Vella Lavella Admiral Halsey had earlier seen the wisdom of bypassing the heavily fortified island of Kolombangara and invading Vella Lavella instead, the latter island lying closer to Bougainville and Rabaul and being less well defended. Thus, a month before New Georgia was secured by the Allies, they landed a reconnaissance party on Vella Lavella to gain information about Japanese strength and dispositions as well as about suitable landing sites, before returning to Guadalcanal on 31 July. The village of Barakoma near the island's southeastern tip was selected as the landing place.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 130 A large invasion force of about 6,500 troops led by Major General Robert B. McClure, escorted by 12 destroyers under the command of Admiral Wilkinson was dispatched from Guadalcanal early on 14 August.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 176. That night, Japanese planes attacked multiple Allied bases, but completely missed this fleet headed for Vella Lavella. The next morning, disembarkation began at Barakoma.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 135 155 mm gun at Barakoma The Japanese high command in Tokyo had already decided that no more troops would be wasted in the central Solomons. Rather than reinforce and defend Vella Lavella, it was to be used merely as a way station for the evacuation of the troops on Kolombangara that had been bypassed by the Allies with this new landing. Horaniu, on the northeast coast, was selected as a barge staging point and on the night of 17‚Äì18 August a small force of ground and naval troops was sent to secure the area. The Japanese destroyer covering force was met in The Slot by four US destroyers under Captain Thomas J. Ryan, and subsequently fought an inconclusive action off Horaniu. No ships of either side were lost and the Japanese succeeded in establishing a barge base.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 233‚Äì234 Meanwhile, throughout August, the Allies pushed the remaining Japanese ground forces on Vella Lavella into a pocket in the northwest corner of the island. The 3rd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Harold E. Barrowclough, was tasked with destroying this pocket. The New Zealanders began their pincer movement on 21 September, but the Japanese resisted so fiercely that it took until 5‚Äì6 October to bottle them up.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 141 On the night of 6‚Äì7 October, Rear Admiral Matsuji Ijuin led a naval force to take the 600 remaining ground troops off Vella Lavella. In response, a force of US destroyers was dispatched to intercept them. Each side lost a ship in the ensuing naval battle, but the Japanese were able to successfully complete their evacuation.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 243‚Äì250 As a result, General Barrowclough's men entered the evacuated area unopposed, concluding the New Georgia campaign.Horton, New Georgia: Pattern for Victory, p. 141 Aftermath Casualties during the campaign amounted to 1,195 US servicemen killed and 93 aircraft destroyed, while the Japanese lost 1,671 killed, and 358 aircraft destroyed.Altobello, Into the Shadows Furious, p. 354. In addition, a total of 3,873 US troops were wounded. Casualties from disease were numerous, as were psychological casualties, with over 2,500 troops being diagnosed with \\"war neurosis\\" between 30 June and 30 September.Miller Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 120‚Äì122 & 187 The next stage of the Allied advance through the Solomons saw them land at Cape Torokina as part of efforts to secure Bougainville beginning in November; this campaign would last until the end of the war with Australian troops relieving US troops in late 1944. This was preceded by diversionary actions in the Treasury Islands by elements of the New Zealand 3rd Division, and by US Marines on Choiseul.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, pp. 238‚Äì241 Elsewhere, in New Guinea, commencing in late September, the Allies launched campaigns in the Markham Valley and on the Huon Peninsula as part of efforts to secure Lae and Finschhafen.Keogh, The South West Pacific 1941‚Äì45, pp. 310‚Äì319 In analyzing the campaign, historian Samuel Eliot Morison described it as \\"the most unintelligently waged land campaign of the Pacific war (with the possible exception of Okinawa)\\", and highlighted the decision to land at Zanana during operations to secure Munda as a mistake, suggesting that Laiana should have been chosen instead. Morison further criticizes the failed flanking move undertaken by Hester's troops to break the deadlock during the initial drive on Munda describing it as \\"perhaps the worst blunder in the [campaign]\\".

Plot Sir James Damery comes to see Holmes and Watson about his illustrious client's problem (the client's identity is never revealed to the reader, although Watson finds out at the end of the story; it is heavily implied to be King Edward VII). General de Merville's young daughter Violet has fallen in love with the roguish and sadistic Austrian Baron Adelbert Gruner, who Damery and Holmes are convinced is a shameless philanderer and a murderer. The victim was his last wife, of whose murder he was acquitted owing to a legal technicality and a witness's untimely death. She met her end in the Spl√ºgen Pass. Holmes also finds out that the Baron has expensive tastes and is a collector and a recognised authority on Chinese pottery. Holmes's first step is to see Gruner, who is amused to see Holmes trying to \\"play a hand with no cards in it\\". The Baron will not be moved and claims that his charm is more potent than even a post-hypnotic suggestion in conditioning Violet's mind to reject anything bad that might be said about him. Gruner tells the story of Le Brun, a French agent who was crippled for life after being beaten by thugs after making similar inquiries into the Baron's personal business. Holmes gets some help with his mission in the form of Shinwell Johnson, a former criminal who now acts as an informer for Holmes in London's underworld. Johnson rakes up Miss Kitty Winter, the Baron's last mistress, who was ruined because of it. She is bent on revenge and will do anything to help Holmes. Kitty tells Holmes that the Baron \\"collects women\\" and chronicles his conquests in a book. Holmes realises that this book, written in Gruner's own hand, is the key to curing Violet of her devotion to the scoundrel. Kitty tells Holmes that this book is kept in the Baron's study. First, Holmes goes to see Violet, bringing Kitty with him, but Violet is proof against Holmes's words. Kitty then makes it clear that Violet might end up dead if she is foolish enough to marry Gruner. The meeting ends with Holmes narrowly averting a public scene involving the enraged Kitty. Next, Holmes is attacked by two men, and the newspapers imply that he is near death. Watson goes to 221B Baker Street only to discover that Holmes's injuries have been exaggerated to give the impression that he will be out of action for quite a while. Several days later, Holmes is sufficiently recovered to be out of bed. The Baron is planning a trip to the United States just before the wedding and will be leaving in three days. Holmes knows that Gruner will take his incriminating book with him, never daring to leave it behind in his study. Holmes orders Watson to learn everything that he can about Chinese pottery in the next 24 hours. The next day, Holmes presents Watson with a fake business card styling him as \\"Dr. Hill Barton\\" and an actual piece of Ming pottery, a saucer. He is to go to Baron Gruner's house, pose as a connoisseur of Chinese pottery, and try to sell the saucer. Watson does as Holmes tells him but cannot fool the Baron for very long. Gruner realises who has sent him. As Watson faces his murderous captor, a noise from another room alerts the Baron and he rushes into his study just in time to see Holmes jump out of the window. The Baron rushes to the window, but Kitty Winter, who has been hiding outside, throws vitriol in his face. Watson applies treatment to his injuries. During Holmes' visit he manages to steal the book. The Baron is now hideously disfigured, but Holmes says this will not put Violet off him. They still need the book to cure her. When Violet sees the book of conquests, written in her fianc√©'s handwriting, she realises what a rogue he is. An announcement in The Morning Post says that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville is off. It also says vitriol-throwing charges are being pressed against Kitty Winter. Extenuating circumstances reduce her sentence to the lowest possible for such an offence.

The story was published in Collier's with four illustrations by John Richard Flanagan, and in the Strand with eight illustrations by Howard K. Elcock. It was included in the short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.Cawthorne (2011), p. 150. Adaptations=Radio The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 23 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 27. Radio adaptations of the story, possibly with the same script or a slightly altered script, also aired in the same series on 8 March 1933 (again with Gordon and Lovell)Dickerson (2019), p. 51. and 18 April 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson),Dickerson (2019), p. 73. and on the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 5 October 1941 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson)Dickerson (2019), p. 102. and 9 May 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 253. Carleton Hobbs played Sherlock Holmes with Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson in a radio adaptation that aired in 1960 on the BBC Light Programme. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick. \\"The Illustrious Client\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of his complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Michael Feast as Baron Gruner and Ruth Gemmell as Violet de Merville. In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as part of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Television The story was adapted in 1965 for an episode of Sherlock Holmes, starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson, Peter Wyngarde as Baron Gr√ºner and Rosemary Leach as Kitty Winter. The 1991 Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original, except that it shows that Miss Winter's revenge attempt on the Baron was because he had disfigured her neck and chest with vitriol, and in the small detail that Gr√ºner finds Holmes inside the house, and Kitty (played by Kim Thomson) rushes inside and past Holmes to throw the vitriol at Gr√ºner played by Anthony Valentine. In Elementarys third season, Kitty Winter (Ophelia Lovibond) and Adelbert Gruner (Stuart Townsend) are introduced in a mid-season story arc that changes Gruner from a philanderer and a baron to a corporate vice president and serial rapist-murderer. Kitty escaped from his captivity before he was able to kill her. She spends the first half of the season training under Holmes as a detective. When Gruner arrives in New York, she exposes his identity. Violet de Merville is a supporting character, the sister of another suspect who has no connection to Gruner. In this version, Kitty flees the United States to an unstated destination so as to escape arrest after she scarred Gruner's face with a caustic chemical. In a later episode, The View From Olympus, Holmes mentions a previous case about a man who killed his wife on the Spl√ºgen Pass and made her murder look like an accident.

This story is one of only two narrated by Holmes rather than Doctor Watson - the other one being \\"The Adventure of the Lion's Mane\\". Dr. Watson does not appear in either story. Plot In January 1903, at Baker Street, James M. Dodd sees Holmes about a missing friend, Godfrey Emsworth. Dodd and Emsworth served together in the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa during the Second Boer War, which has only just ended. Emsworth was wounded during this war. Dodd has not seen him since the report of his injury leading Dodd to believe something is amiss. Dodd tried writing to Colonel Emsworth, Godfrey's father, and was told in response that Godfrey went off to sea, however Dodd was not satisfied with this answer. Next, Dodd went to the Emsworth family home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford. There were four people there‚Äîthe Colonel and his wife, and an old butler and his wife. The Colonel was something less than a gracious host. He repeated the story about his son's world voyage, implied that Dodd was lying about even knowing Godfrey, and seemed irritated at Dodd's suggestion that he provide information that would allow him to send Godfrey a letter. Dodd was still determined to ascertain Godfrey's fate. That evening, in the ground-floor bedroom, Dodd talked to the butler, Ralph, when he came to deliver some coal. When Ralph mentioned Godfrey in the past tense, Dodd began to suspect that his friend was dead. Ralph indicated that no, he wasn't, but that it might be better that way. The mystery was further complicated when Dodd observed Godfrey's face in his window, finally proving that he was on the grounds and not at sea like the colonel had claimed. Dodd tried to chase him, but gave up shortly after hearing the sound of a closing door nearby. Dodd contrived to stay another day at Tuxbury Old Park, and went looking about the property. He saw a well-dressed man leaving an outbuilding, whose suspicion was aroused somewhat, as Dodd was aware that he was watching him. Dodd was convinced Godfrey must be in this outbuilding. Dodd went back to the outbuilding at night, and observed the well dressed man and another, who he assumed was Godfrey, through the window. Before he could investigate further, Colonel Emsworth appeared. Upset that Dodd would violate the family's privacy, he insisted Dodd leave immediately. Dodd comes straight to Holmes to relate the story. Holmes needs only to ask about the publication that the man with Godfrey was reading, and although Dodd cannot be absolutely sure of it, Holmes seems satisfied with the answer. Upon his arrival at Tuxbury Old Park, Holmes observes a tarry smell coming from the leather gloves that Ralph has just removed. The Colonel threatens to summon the police if Dodd and Holmes do not leave, but Holmes points out that doing this would cause the very catastrophe the Colonel wants to avoid. Convincing the colonel that he knows the secret, Holmes receives permission to visit the outbuilding, where he and Dodd hear Godfrey's story right from his own lips. The night he was wounded in South Africa, he found his way to a house and slept in a bed there. When he woke up in the morning, he found himself surrounded by lepers. A doctor there told him that he was in a leper hospital, and would likely contract the disease after sleeping in a leper's bed. The doctor helped heal his wounds, and once Godfrey got back to England, the dreaded symptoms began to appear. His family's fear of their son being put in an institution, and possibly the stigma attached to leprosy, have forced them to keep his presence secret. The story ends happily, however. Holmes has brought with him Sir James Saunders, a famous dermatologist from London. Dr. Saunders determines that Emsworth actually has ichthyosis, or pseudo-leprosy, a disease that is quite treatable. Related stories Holmes's investigation of the mystery is delayed because he is engaged in clearing up \\"the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved\\".

Biography Born in Contoocookville, New Hampshire, in the northern part of Hopkinton to the Honorable Hamilton Eliot Perkins, George was appointed as acting midshipman in October 1851 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with the class of 1856. During the rest of that decade Midshipman Perkins served on at sea on the sloop of war Cyane, the storeship Release and the steamer Sumpter. He attained the ranks of Master in 1859 and Lieutenant in February 1861, on the eve of the Civil War. Perkins spent the conflict's first several months in the Sumpter, operating on anti-slavery patrols. In early 1862 he was assigned as Executive Officer to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron (WGBS) Unadilla-class gunboat USS Cayuga under its commanding officer Lieutenant N.B. (Napoleon Bonaparte) Harrison in which he performed distinguished service during the 1862 campaigns to capture New Orleans and the lower Mississippi River. During Admiral Farragut's assault up- river towards New Orleans April 24‚Äì25, the Cayuga, with Lt. Perkins at the wheel through the storm of shot and shell, was the first warship to pass forts Jackson and St. Phillip. The Cayuga found itself alone north of the forts and being assailed by eleven Confederate vessels including the sloop rigged steamer C.S.S. Gov. Moore which the Cayuga sank, and the ram C.S.S. Manassas whose attack narrowly missed the Cayuga's stern. Once the fleet lay at anchor in the river off New Orleans, Lt. Perkins accompanied Capt. Theodorus Bailey, U.S.N., in the first boat sent ashore, to demand the surrender of the city (which was refused). Monument to Perkins by sculptor Daniel Chester French and architect Henry Bacon as erected at the New Hampshire State House in Concord in 1902. He was next executive officer of the steam sloop Pensacola, receiving promotion to lieutenant commander at the end of 1862. His service on the Mississippi and in the Gulf of Mexico continued in 1863‚Äì1865, including command of gunboats New London and Sciota, and the monitor Chickasaw. While in the latter ship, his aggressive and effective conduct during the August 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay was a major factor in the capture of the Confederate ironclad Tennessee. In the years immediately following the Civil War, Lieutenant Commander Perkins was superintendent of iron-clads at New Orleans, executive officer of the steam sloop Lackawanna in the North Pacific, and had ordnance duty at the Boston Navy Yard. Reaching the rank of commander in early 1871, he spent the next decade as commanding officer of the storeship Relief and gunboat Ashuelot and had further shore duty at Boston. Perkins was promoted to captain in 1882 and commanded the Pacific Station flagship during the mid-1880s. Captain Perkins' subsequent active service was limited to court-martial duty. He was transferred to the Retired List in October 1891, but in 1896 received a Congressionally authorized promotion to the retired rank of commodore in recognition of his gallantry and skill during the Battle of Mobile Bay three decades earlier. Commodore Perkins died at Boston on 28 October 1899. Family Perkins as a young midshipman during the 1850s. The commodore married a daughter of William Fletcher Weld, a multimillionaire from Boston's famous Weld Family. Their daughter, Isabel Weld Perkins, married Larz Anderson, a wealthy businessman who served as Ambassador to Japan under William Howard Taft. Among the homes they maintained was Perkins Manor, the commodore's birthplace. The Andersons' legacy to the public includes Anderson House, Anderson Memorial Bridge, Larz Anderson Auto Museum, Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection and Larz Anderson Park.

Factors that determine tilth include the formation and stability of aggregated soil particles, moisture content, degree of aeration, soil biota, rate of water infiltration and drainage. Tilth can change rapidly, depending on environmental factors such as changes in moisture, tillage and soil amendments. The objective of tillage (mechanical manipulation of the soil) is to improve tilth, thereby increasing crop production; in the long term, however, conventional tillage, especially plowing, often has the opposite effect, causing the soil to break down and become compacted. Soil with good tilth has large pore spaces for air infiltration and water movement. Roots only grow where the soil tilth allows for adequate levels of soil oxygen. Such soil also holds a reasonable supply of water and nutrients. Tillage, organic matter amendments, fertilization and irrigation can each improve tilth, but when used excessively, can have the opposite effect. Crop rotation and cover crops can positively impact tilth. A combined approach can produce the greatest improvement.  Aggregation  Good tilth shares a balanced relation between soil-aggregate tensile strength and friability, in which it has a stable mixture of aggregate soil particles that can be readily broken up by shallow non-abrasive tilling. A high tensile strength will result in large cemented clods of compacted soil with low friability. Proper management of agricultural soils can positively impact soil aggregation and improve tilth quality. Aggregation is positively associated with tilth. With finer-textured soils, aggregates may in turn be made up of smaller aggregates. Aggregation implies substantial pores between individual aggregates. Aggregation is important in the subsoil, the layer below tillage. Such aggregates involve larger (2- to 6-inch) blocks of soil that are more angular and not as distinctive. These aggregates are less impacted by biological activity than the tillage layer. Subsurface aggregates are important for root growth deep into the profile. Deep roots allow greater access to moisture, which helps in drought periods. Subsoil aggregates can also be compacted, mainly by heavy equipment on wet soil. Another significant source of subsoil compaction is the practice of plowing with tractor wheels in the open furrow.  Pore size  Soil that is well aggregated has a range of pore sizes. Each pore size plays a role in soil's physical functioning. Large pores drain rapidly and are needed for good air exchange during wet periods, preventing oxygen deficiency that can drown plants and increase pest problems. Denitrification by conversion of nitrogen to gaseous forms is increased in oxygen-deficient wet soil. In degraded soil large pores are compressed into small ones. Small pores are critical for water retention and help a crop endure dry periods with minimal yield loss.  Management  Soil tilth can be obtained through mechanical and biological manipulation.  Tillage  Mechanical soil cultivation practices, including primary tillage (mold-board or chisel plowing) followed by secondary tillage (disking, harrowing, etc.), break up and aerate soil. Mechanical traffic and intensive tilling methods have a negative impact on soil aggregates, friability, soil porosity, and soil-bulk density. When soils become degraded and compacted, such tillage practices are often deemed necessary. The tilth created by tillage, however, tends to be unstable, because the aggregation is obtained through the physical manipulation of the soil, which is short lived, especially after years of intensive tillage. The compaction of soil aggregates can also decrease soil biota due to the low levels of oxygen in the top-soil. The resulting high soil-bulk density results in lower water infiltration from rainfall or conventional irrigation (surface, sprinkler, center-pivot); in turn, the series of processes will naturally erode and dissolve small soil particles and organic matter. The consequences from these processes cyclically require more tilling and intervention, thus tillage practices have the capability to disrupt biological mechanisms that stabilize soil structure and tilth quality.  Biological  The preferred scenario for good tilth is as the result of natural soil-building processes, provided by the activity of plant roots, microorganisms, earthworms and other beneficial organisms. Such stable aggregates break apart during tillage/planting and readily provide good tilth. Soil biota and organic matter work in unison to bind soil aggregates and establish a natural soil stability. Extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) emitted by bacteria, fungal hyphae, and dispersed clay particles actively participate in tilth-forming processes that contribute to the formation and stabilization of soil structure. The resulting soil structure reduces tensile strength and soil-bulk density while still forming soil aggregates through their abiotic/biotic binding mechanisms that resist breakdown during soil saturation. The fungal hyphae networks can establish a role of enmeshment with EPS and rhizodeposition, thus improving aggregate stability. However, these organic materials are themselves subject to biological degradation, requiring active amendments with organic material, and minimal mechanical tillage. Tilth quality is heavily dependent on these naturally binding processes between biotic microorganisms and abiotic soil particles, as well as the necessary input of organic matter. All constituents in this naturally binding network must be supplied or managed in agriculture to ensure the sustainability of their presence through growing seasons.  Rotation  Crop rotation can help restore tilth in compacted soils. Two processes contribute to this gain. First, accelerated organic matter decomposition from tillage ends under the sod crop. Another way to achieve this is via no-till farming. Second, grass and legume sods develop extensive root systems that continually grow and die off. The dead roots supply a source of active organic matter, which feeds soil organisms that create aggregation. Beneficial organisms need continual supplies of organic matter to sustain themselves and they deposit the digested materials on soil aggregates and thereby stabilize them. Also, the living roots and symbiotic microorganisms (for example, mycorrhizal fungi) can exude organic materials that nourish soil organisms and help with aggregation. Grass and legume sod crops therefore return more organic matter to the soil than most other crops. Some annual rotation crops such as buckwheat also have dense, fibrous, root systems and can improve tilth. Crop mixtures with different rooting systems can be beneficial. For example, red clover seeded into winter wheat provide additional roots and a more protein-rich organic matter. Other rotation crops are more valuable for improving subsoils. Perennial crops such as alfalfa have strong, deep, penetrating tap roots that can push through hard layers, especially during wet periods when the soil is soft. These deep roots establish pathways for water and future plant roots, and produce organic matter. Crops rotation can extend the period of active growth compared to conventional row crops, leaving more organic material behind. For example, in a corn-soybean rotation, active growth occurs 32 percent of the time, while a dry bean‚Äìwinter wheat‚Äìcorn rotation is active 72 percent. Crops such as rye, wheat, oat, barley, pea and cool-season grasses grow actively in the late fall and early spring when other crops are inactive. They are beneficial both as rotation and cover crops, although intensive tillage can negate their effects.  Soil types  The soil management practices required to maintain soil tilth are a function of the type of soil. Sandy and gravelly soils are naturally deficient in small pores and are therefore drought prone, whereas loams and clays can retain and thus supply crops with more water.  Coarse-textured, sandy soils  Sandy soil has lower capacity to hold water and nutrients. Water is applied more frequently in smaller amounts to avoid it leaching and carrying nutrients below the root zone. Routine application of organic matter increases sandy soil's ability to hold water and nutrients by 10 times or more.  Fine-textured, clay soils  Clay soils lack large pores, restricting both water and air movement. During irrigation or rain events, the limited large pore space in fine- textured soils quickly fills with water, reducing soil oxygen levels. In addition to routine application of organic matter, microorganisms and earthworms perform a crucial assist to soil tilth. As microorganisms decompose the organic matter, soil particles bind together into larger aggregates, increasing large pore space. Clay soils are more subject to soil compaction, which reduces large pore spaces.  Gravelly and decomposed granite soils  Such soils natively have little tilth, especially once they have been disturbed. Adding organic matter up to 25% by volume can help compensate. For example, if tilling to a depth of eight inches, add two inches of organic materials.

It was first published in The Strand Magazine in 1926 as a serial. Plot The story begins with a visit to 221B Baker Street from Steve Dixie, a black man and a cowardly ruffian who warns Sherlock Holmes to keep away from Harrow. Although Dixie has come to intimidate Holmes, Holmes secures Dixie's future cooperation by threatening to tell what he knows about the suspicious Perkins death involving Dixie. Dixie's boss is Barney Stockdale, and he must be connected with the Harrow Weald case, of which Holmes has just learnt from a message from Mary Maberley, a lady who lives at Three Gables, a house at Harrow Weald. Mrs. Maberley is an elderly woman whose son has recently died in Rome. He was an attach√© there. Some peculiar things have happened at Three Gables. Mrs. Maberley has lived there nearly two years and in all that time has attracted very little attention from her neighbours. Suddenly, however, a man came to her recently and offered to buy her house and all the furniture in it. She was not really willing to do it, especially after her lawyer, Mr. Sutro, told her that the legal agreement drawn up by this prospective buyer would forbid her to remove any possessions from the house when she moved out. As she is telling Holmes this story, he becomes aware that someone is eavesdropping on the conversation. He opens a door and drags in Susan, a wheezing maid. Holmes manages to establish that Susan communicated to Barney Stockdale the fact that her mistress was hiring Sherlock Holmes, and that precipitated Steve Dixie's visit. Holmes also finds out that a rich woman hired Barney Stockdale and his thugs to do her dirty work. Susan is also a member of the gang but will not give up all their secrets. She leaves in a huff. Obviously, this woman wants something that has come into the house quite recently. Holmes, seeing some trunks with Italian placenames on them, realizes that her late son Douglas's belongings must hold the key. He instructs Mrs. Maberley to try to get Mr. Sutro to spend a couple of nights at Three Gables, to keep the house guarded. Holmes finds Dixie outside, keeping the house under surveillance. Dixie is now inclined to help Holmes if he can, to avoid any indiscreet talk about the Perkins lad who met his end so tragically. He swears, however, that he does not know who has hired Barney Stockdale. Holmes and Watson go back to Three Gables to investigate a burglary that has happened there. The burglars chloroformed Mrs. Maberley and stole a manuscript from her son's belongings. She retained part of one sheet of paper from it when, coming round, she lunged after one of the thieves. The police inspector at the scene treats the matter as an ordinary burglary, but Holmes knows better. He examines the bit of manuscript retained by Mrs. Maberley, and it appears to be the end of a lurid novel. Holmes is struck by the peculiar wording; the story abruptly changes from third-person narration to first-person narration. It is in Douglas's handwriting; so it would seem that he was putting himself in a story that he was writing. Holmes and Watson go to see Isadora Klein, a wealthy woman who is used to getting what she wants. The happenings at Three Gables and the information from Langdale Pike have all added up to something. It turns out that Douglas Maberley was involved with Isadora Klein at one time. She broke the relationship off, and he almost wrought his revenge by writing a thinly veiled account of their affair, to be published as a novel. Everyone in London would know who the characters truly were, were the novel ever published. Isadora established that no copy had ever been sent to Douglas's publisher but realized that he must have a copy. She hired Barney Stockdale and his confederates to secure the manuscript. She tried legal means at first, and when that did not work, she resorted to crime. She has burnt the manuscript. Holmes forces Isadora Klein to write a cheque for ¬£5000 to furnish Mrs. Maberley with a first-class trip round the world in return for his silence about Isadora's nefarious dealings. Commentaries  The Adventure of the Three Gables has been criticized for its reliance on racist stereotypes in the portrayal of the black boxer, Steve Dixie. This contrasts strikingly with Doyle's earlier sympathetic portrayal of an interracial marriage, in The Adventure of the Yellow Face (1893). D. Martin Dakin wrote that \\"no admirer of Holmes can read these scenes [with or discussing Steve Dixie] without a blush\\". Dakin saw Holmes's crude jeers at Dixie as completely out of character for the detective, and this was one reason behind his conclusion that someone other than Doyle had in fact written the story. Others, including Walter Pond, have rejected Dakin's argument and concluded that there is no reason to doubt Doyle's authorship. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Three Gables\\" was first published in the US in Liberty in September 1926, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October 1926.Smith (2014), p. 212. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Liberty, and with four illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 156. It was included in the short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151. Adaptations=Radio The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 12 November 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 27. Other dramatisations of the story, also adapted by Meiser, aired on 7 April 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson)Dickerson (2019), p. 40. and on the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 18 January 1942 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 90. Carleton Hobbs played Sherlock Holmes with Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick. The cast included Frank Singuineau as Steve Dixie and Selma Vaz Dias as Isadora Klein. \\"The Three Gables\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of Bert Coules‚Äô complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Susannah Corbett as Susan Stockdale and Mary Wimbush as Mrs Maberly. In this adaptation, it is stated that \\"Langdale Pike\\" is a pen name derived from the Langdale Pikes, and that his real name is Clarence Gable. In 2007, the story was adapted as an episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Like in the 1994 BBC adaptation, it is stated in the episode that \\"Langdale Pike\\" is a pseudonym. In this adaptation, he is a disinherited member of a noble family and his real name is implied to be Lord Peter. Television Granada Television's Sherlock Holmes series featuring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr Watson presented the story with several differences. Douglas Maberley is depicted as Mary Maberley's grandson instead of her son; he dies in his grandmother's house after a month of suffering from a bout of pneumonia caused by a savage beating he received from Mrs Klein's hired boxers; Langdale Pike defines himself as a benevolent counterpart of Charles Augustus Milverton (the eponym of an earlier story about a blackmailer, although his last name is slightly different) and points out that he suppresses more than he exposes; and Steve Dixie retains some enmity towards Holmes and brawls with Watson during the break-in. In CBS' contemporary Sherlock Holmes adaptation Elementary, the season 2 premiere episode, \\"Step Nine\\", features a case very briefly involving a character named Langdale Pike, the owner of a 3D printer manufacturing company that Holmes seeks out via a sign requesting something from him, which he holds up in front of a security camera for an extended period of time. The episode \\"The Adventure of the Blue Polar Bear\\" from the NHK puppet series Sherlock Holmes, is based on \\"The Adventure of the Three Gables\\" and \\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\\". It features Isadora Klein as a female juvenile gang leader.

Thus, marketing messages aimed at that target age will resonate with consumers of other ages.Wayne D. Hoyer and Deborah J. MacInnis. Consumer Behavior. Mason: South-Western, 2010. 393. The aspirational age in Western society is the cusp between childhood and adulthood. In theory, consumers younger than this age aspire to the maturity and freedom it signifies, while those older than it seek to recapture the youthfulness and freedom from responsibility of this age. Thus, products pitched at notional young adults will appeal to a broader target market.  Ideology  The aspirational age can be identified as the age of which consumers associate positive experiences with, such as freedom. For example, most adults are preoccupied with day-to-day responsibilities which can be viewed as stressful. Marketing to the aspirational age therefore, allows businesses to attract a generation of nostalgic consumers. The aspirational age as a tool is thus essentially modelled on the notion of nostalgia. From the adult's perspective, the psychology behind the 'aspirational age' can be defined as a recapture of youthful days. 'High-speed modern living, stress and the impact of recession' have all been considered as factors which influence a consumer's longing of their 'aspirational age'.  Evidence  The aspirational age relies on a youth-obsessed culture, which is particularly associated with the Western World, specifically America. Crux Research states that the aspirational age in the form of adverts targeted to kids, essentially works as 'adults aspire backwards'. Thus utilising this emotional link allows marketers, if effective, to target a wider audience. A study of 'Age Related Vicarious Nostalgia and Aesthetic Consumption' from the University of Wolverhampton concluded age as a phenomenon which is not 'totally bound to chronological time constraints'. In this sense, nostalgia 'has a bearing on the cognitive age of the individual', making it useful for businesses to market towards the aspiration age, in an attempt to trigger a pleasant cognitive response. The Harvard Business Review article on a study conducted by the Grenoble School of Management, states that 'nostalgic feelings increased people's willingness to pay for desired objects'. The article concludes that the psychology behind the aspirational age is 'useful to brands looking to elicit feelings of nostalgia in their promotions' . The article uses Subaru's 2012 'First Car Story' as an example, although the car does not target 16-year-olds, the campaign allows adults to create their own first car story through animation. The desired result, as the study suggests, is that when consumers think nostalgically, they spend more money.  Examples  Examples of real-life businesses who appear to market towards the aspirational age include Urban Outfitters and Pepsi. An article by The Business Journals identifies how using technology, businesses market their products to the aspirational age. The aspirational age then becomes a tool for product development alongside marketing. The article cites Urban Outfitters' nostalgic marketing of introducing old famous brands i.e. Lisa Frank, Nickelodeon's '90 Are All That' time slots and Pepsi's 'Pepsi Throwback' as example of businesses which market towards the aspirational age. Thus the aspirational age as a tool, targets the particular age whilst simultaneously allowing the older generation to reflect on products or services they once loved.  Differences = Generational Differences  Differences between generations would however mean that marketing to the 'aspirational age' today might not necessarily attract older consumers, as their experiences of being younger would differ greatly. Social changes and technological advancements would have influenced different experiences thus different aspirations. * Generation Y; (1977-1994) Generation Y is defined as a product of 'Baby Boomers', accustomed to the onset of media and the genesis of the Internet. Generation Y is categorised by 'choice customisation, scrutiny, integrity, speed and entertainment'. * Generation X; (1994 onwards) Generation X is characterised by the onset of 'Tweendom'. Teenagers within this generation today recognised by the need for 'instant gratification, success as a given and liberal social values'. Thus the product of a Generation Y youth would be more accustomed to 'cyber speak' (certainly within the Western world). Since one quarter of 8-18 year olds spend their time using social media, the aspirational age can be difficult to estimate. The success of the aspirational age as a marketing tool is dependable on the success of how adaptable the latter generation is towards the target audience.  Industries  Music = Businesses can market to the aspirational age, yet this would vary depending on the industry. For example, music labels can build brand development according to their own 'aspirational ages'. Labels can identify the age of 32 as an aspirational age for example. How Music Builds Value identifies the 32-year-old lifestyle as a time which can 'supersede the elements of mass-market life'. The case study cites that the label (Smashburger) can create an 'aspirational experience' by targeting 32-year- olds due to being a 'magical age'. = Food = Differences within a particular industry can also occur in terms of appropriate aspirational ages. An Integrated Approach to New Food Product Development recognises the aspirational age as '1‚Äì3 years older than the calendar age of the child'. This would depend on the product and who the manufacturer aims to target. If the business desires a wider target audience, the target age should be 'acceptable to the youngest age in the target'. The article recognises the aspirational age as the 'safe' choice as consumers would not 'reject a product that has a simpler flavour profile'.  Cultural Differences  The aspirational age of the Western world would differ greatly. For example, to assume the aspired age (if accepted as within adolescence) would correspond universally could be stereotypical. Heavily influenced by societal laws such as marriageable age or legal drinking for example, differences in experiences would thus lead to different idealised aspirational ages between cultures.  Issues = Stereotypes  A report by Age UK recognised advertising aimed at the aspirational age rather than the biological age as 'stereotypical'. A study conducted by Age UK, led by Sandra Chalmers found that elderly people felt that their generation were 'completely ignored'. Thus under-representation of older consumers due to marketing towards an aspirational age can be risky. Ann Murray Chatterton examined 52 commercials to find 35% included someone who was above the age of 50, and 12% including someone above the age of 65 years. Consequently, older consumers are less represented in an attempt to capture the target audience.  Effectiveness and Future Use of the Aspirational Age = Product Development  The article Nostalgia: A Neuropsychiatric Understanding even suggests that product development using smell can induce 'nostalgic recall' and is thus an important 'marketing tool'. In this sense, the aspirational age can be embedded as a factor within product development.  Reversals  Reversals of the aspirational age would differ as the child's aspirational age has risen 'whilst the adults has fallen'. Children at Play: An American History assessed the relationship between products and age within America to conclude that 'marketers who once sought to sell toys to fourteen year olds have lowered their age target to ten'. The aspirational age will continue to adapt as societal changes occur. \\"An eleven year old no longer asks for a stuffed animal or a fire truck and instead desires a Madden NFL football game, a cell phone, an iPod, or a Beyonce Knowles CD, while a thirty-five-year-old may also indulge by buying a Madden football game, a cell phone, an iPod, or a Beyonce Knowles CD\\".

It was first published in the January 1924 issues of The Strand Magazine in London and Hearst's International Magazine in New York.Christopher Redmond, Sherlock Holmes Handbook: Second Edition (Dundurn, 2009), , pp. 35‚Äì36. Excerpts available at Google Books.  Plot summary  An advert from the 28 December 1923 edition of The Radio Times for the January 1924 edition of The Strand Magazine, leading with the announcement of the \\"new complete story of Sherlock Holmes by A. Conan Doyle\\", whose title is not given Holmes receives an odd letter that makes reference to vampires. Mr. Robert Ferguson, who comes to 221B Baker Street the next morning, has become convinced that his Peruvian second wife has been sucking their baby son's blood. By his first wife, he has a 15-year-old son named Jack, who suffered an unfortunate accident as a child and now, although he can still walk, he does not have the full use of his legs. After the bloodsucking began, Jack has unaccountably been struck twice by his stepmother, although Mr. Ferguson cannot imagine why. Ever since being found out by her husband, she has locked herself in her room and refused to come out. Only her Peruvian maid, Dolores, is allowed in. She takes Mrs. Ferguson her meals. Even before Holmes and Watson set off for Mr. Ferguson's house in Sussex, Holmes has deduced what is going on, and it has nothing to do with vampires. Holmes's trip is made simply to observe and confirm what he has already deduced. Upon their arrival in Sussex, Mrs. Ferguson's maid announces that her mistress is ill, and Dr. Watson offers to help. He finds an agitated woman in the room upstairs ‚Äì she speaks of all being destroyed, and of sacrificing herself rather than breaking her husband's heart. She also demands her child, who has been with the nurse, Mrs. Mason, ever since Mr. Ferguson has known about the bloodsucking incidents. Holmes examines the South American weapons displayed in the house and meets the children. While Mr. Ferguson is doting on his younger son, Watson notices that Holmes is gazing at the window. He cannot imagine why his friend is doing this. Holmes then explains the truth about what has been happening, much to the relief of Mrs. Ferguson as this is exactly what she has wanted: for the truth to come from someone else's lips. It turns out that the culprit is Jack, Mr. Ferguson's elder son, who is extremely jealous of his young half-brother. Holmes has deduced this and confirmed it by looking at Jack's reflection in the window while his father's attention was on the baby. Jack has been attempting to murder his half-brother by shooting poisoned darts at him, and his stepmother's behaviour of sucking the baby's neck is thereby explained: she was sucking the poison out. It also explains why she struck Jack, and why she was sick when Holmes and Watson arrived. The wounds, therefore, were caused by the darts, not by her biting.  Matilda Briggs and the Giant Rat of Sumatra  In \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\", Holmes mentions to Watson the case of the ship Matilda Briggs and the Giant Rat of Sumatra, identifying it as \\"a story for which the world is not yet prepared\\". This single reference has been expanded upon by a number of other authors and performers who have either created their own versions of the story or alluded to it in tales of their own.

The script was used again for an episode that aired on 7 March 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 73. Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 2 October 1939 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson),Dickerson (2019), p. 86. and another episode that aired on 14 December 1947 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 243. A radio dramatisation of the story adapted by Michael Hardwick aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1964, as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. \\"The Sussex Vampire\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Troughton as Robert Ferguson. In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  In a 1993 televised adaptation of this case entitled The Last Vampyre, produced by Granada Television and starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, the case was altered. In the televised version, Holmes was called by the town vicar to investigate the death of the baby, with the prime suspect being the newly arrived Mr. John Stockton, a man who is rumoured to be descended from a family of vampires. During this investigation, it is revealed that Jack, driven to delusions due to the childhood accident which cost him the full use of his legs, has come to believe himself to be a vampire because of the power and fear such a creature inspires, seeing Stockton as a 'mentor' of sorts due to his seemingly vampire-like ability to charm women. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire Lot\\", first aired in 1999. The 2018 Japanese television drama Miss Sherlock adapted \\"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\\" in season 1, episode 4 \\"The Wakasugi Family\\", setting it in Japan.

Plot Holmes receives a letter from a Nathan Garrideb of 136 Little Ryder Street,An actual London street, with a history going back to the seventeenth Century asking for help in a most peculiar quest. He is looking for another man with his unusual surname, for it will mean a $5 million inheritance for him. He has been approached by another man, John Garrideb of Kansas, who says that he needs to find others with the same last name. The American Garrideb comes to see Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street, and is apparently not very pleased that Nathan Garrideb has involved a detective. Garrideb, who claims to be a lawyer, spins a ridiculous story about Alexander Hamilton Garrideb, a millionaire land tycoon he met in Kansas. Hamilton Garrideb bequeathed his $15 million estate to John Garrideb on the provision that he find two more Garridebs to share it with equally. He came to England to seek out people with the name, having failed in his own country. So far, he has found only Nathan. During the interview, Holmes detects many discrepancies in John Garrideb's story, ranging from the time he has spent in London being obviously longer than he claims and his knowledge of a completely fictitious mayor of the town where Garrideb claims to have lived in before coming to England, but decides not to confront him. This piques Holmes' interest, and he decides to contact Nathan Garrideb to investigate further. Upon arrival at Little Ryder Street, Holmes observes Nathan Garrideb's nameplate outside the house. It has obviously been there for years; so Holmes concludes that Garrideb is at least his true surname. It turns out that Nathan Garrideb is an elderly eccentric who collects everything from ancient coins to old bones. Garrideb's rooms look like a small museum. He is obviously a serious collector, but has nothing of great value in his collection. Holmes finds out that John Garrideb has never asked for any money, nor has he suggested any course of action. Nathan Garrideb has no reason, it seems, to be suspicious of John Garrideb. This puzzles Holmes. During Holmes's and Watson's visit, John Garrideb arrives in a most jolly mood. He has apparently found a third Garrideb, as proof of which he shows a newspaper advertisement purportedly placed by a Howard Garrideb in the course of his everyday business. Holmes sees instantly that John Garrideb has placed the advertisement himself from various Americanisms in the spelling and wording. Despite Nathan Garrideb's objections‚Äîfor he is a man who very seldom goes out, much less travels‚ÄîJohn Garrideb insists that Nathan go to Birmingham and meet this Howard Garrideb. It has now become clear to Holmes what the \\"rigmarole of lies\\" is all about. John Garrideb wants Nathan Garrideb to be out of his rooms for a while. The next day brings fresh information. Holmes goes to see Inspector Lestrade at Scotland Yard and identifies John Garrideb as James Winter alias Morecroft alias \\"Killer\\" Evans, who escaped prison after shooting three men in the States. In London, he killed Rodger Prescott, a Chicago forger whose description matches the former occupant of Nathan Garrideb's room. Holmes and Watson go to Garrideb's home armed with revolvers. They do not have to wait long before Winter shows up. From their hiding place, Holmes and Watson see the criminal use a \\"jemmy\\" to open a trapdoor revealing a little cellar. They capture Winter, but not before he manages to shoot twice, striking Watson in the leg. For once, Holmes shows his human side; he is distraught over Watson's injury, and strikes Winter on the head with the butt of a gun hard enough to draw blood, vowing that the villain would have never left the rooms alive if he had killed Watson. Fortunately, Watson's wound is superficial. The little cellar contains a printing press and stacks of counterfeit banknotes, hidden there by Prescott, the man that Winter killed. Winter is sent back to prison. Nathan Garrideb ends up in a nursing home, so great is his disappointment, but many CID men are pleased that Prescott's equipment has at last been found. Watson seems the happiest at the adventure's outcome despite being hurt, declaring, \\"It was worth a wound, it was worth many wounds, to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask\\", from the sight of Holmes's panic and rage over his friend's shooting. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Three Garridebs\\" was first published in the US in Collier's in October 1924, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1925.Smith (2014), p. 209. The story was published with three illustrations by John Richard Flanagan in Collier's, and with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 158. It was included in the short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151. As noted by Wilma Morgan,Wilma C. Morgan, \\"Sherlock Holmes Revisited\\" in Barnabas Thompson (ed.) \\"Round Up of New Essays in Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century Popular Culture, 1988\\" The Three Garridebs takes up many plot elements used in the much earlier Red Headed League. \\"Both stories feature a rather naive, sedentary, middle aged bachelor who happens to sit on a location of great interest to cunning criminals. And in both stories, a very elaborate hoax is cooked up, involving a fake bequest by a fictional rich American, in order to make the bachelor go away and leave the criminals a clear field ‚Äî which would have worked fine but for Sherlock Holmes seeing through the hoax. One difference between the two stories ‚Äî and I am not sure that it is an improvement ‚Äî is that in the second case, unlike the first, the innocent bachelor is deeply hurt and damaged by the hoax worked on him.\\" Adaptations=Radio The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 2 June 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 42. Other dramatisations of the story aired on the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 25 December 1939 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, and also adapted by Meiser)Dickerson (2019), p. 89. and 9 May 1949 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Wendell Holmes as Watson).Dickerson (2019), p. 271. Carleton Hobbs played Sherlock Holmes with Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson in a radio adaptation of the story dramatised by Michael Hardwick. It aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme. \\"The Three Garridebs\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by David Ashton as part of Bert Coules‚Äô complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson and featuring Lou Hirsch as John Garrideb. In 2009, the story was adapted for radio as part of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Television The then-newly-formed NBC sought permission from Lady Conan Doyle to produce The Three Garridebs for American television in 1937. This would be the first televised adaptation of Doyle's detective. Louis Hector was cast as Holmes with William Podmore as Watson. Almost sixty years later, the story was again adapted for television. Jeremy Brett was taken ill during the production of the Granada Television adaptation of this story (which was also a conflation with \\"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\\" and transmitted under the latter title) and so Holmes's role in the plot was taken by Mycroft Holmes with Charles Gray called in at short notice to reprise his role as Sherlock's older brother. Some note that \\"In addition to being immensely entertaining, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes has the unfortunate bonus of tracing the decline of Jeremy Brett's health, episode by episode.\\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes The case is referenced in the Sherlock episode \\"The Final Problem\\", when the third Holmes sibling, Eurus Holmes, having taken control of her island prison, challenges Sherlock to identify which of the three Garrideb brothers committed a murder some months ago or she will kill all three. Sherlock is able to identify which brother committed the crime based on photographs and a description of the shooting, eliminating the other two as one lacked the right motor control and the other wore glasses that would have broken when the rifle he used recoiled, but Eurus kills the two innocent brothers instead, and when Watson expresses shock she executes the guilty one anyway just to see if it feels any different.

During his time in Somalia he oversaw UNOSOM II operations including the 'Bloody Monday' attack labelled a massacre of civilians by witnesses. Howe was also the former Deputy National Security Advisor in the first Bush Administration. He currently is Executive Director of The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations. Early life and education Howe is a 1957 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and earned Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University from 1968 to 1969. Naval service Howe's naval commands included the (1974‚Äì1975), Destroyer Squadron 31 (1977‚Äì1978), and Cruiser- Destroyer Group Three (1984‚Äì1986). His other assignments include Military Assistant to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (1969‚Äì1974), Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs (1975‚Äì1977), Chief of Staff of the Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan (1978‚Äì1980), Senior Military Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1982, Director of the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs from 1982 to 1984, Deputy Chairman, NATO Military Committee, Brussels, Belgium (1986‚Äì1987), Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1987‚Äì1989).

Gates when he moved on to become CIA director. He retired from the United States Navy in 1992. During his time as Deputy Assistant he was directly involved in the pursuit of President Manuel Noriega of Panama. Service in Somalia and the Bloody Monday attack In 1992, Howe was selected by the Clinton Administration to head UNOSOM II - the UN operation in Somalia that took over from the US in May in what was described by one American official as \\"the miscasting of the century.\\" In this capacity he came under criticism for hiding away from the action in his fortified bunker, and for his pursuit of Somali military leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid, which was called a \\"personal vendetta.\\" On July 12, 1993, Howe oversaw the event Somalis call Bloody Monday. According to American war correspondent Scott Peterson a group of Somali elders had gathered at a house to discuss a way to make peace to end the violence between Somali militias and the UN forces. The gathering had been publicized in Somali newspapers the day before the attack as a peace gathering. After being tipped off by an undercover operative, American Cobra attack helicopters launched TOW Missiles and 20 mm caliber cannon fire at the structure. According to a Somali survivor, American ground troops killed 15 survivors at close range with pistols, a charge American commanders deny. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross there were over 200 Somali casualties. Four Western journalists were killed at the scene by Somalis following the attacks. Howe claimed that the mission took out a \\"very key terrorist planning cell\\" and that no civilians were killed. He stated \\"we knew what we were hitting. It was well planned.\\" The event is considered a turning point in the war as Somalis turned from wanting peace to wanting revenge, ultimately leading to the Black Hawk Down Incident. Human Rights Watch declared that the attack \\"looked like mass murder.\\" Personal life Howe is author of the 1971 book Multicrises: Seapower and Global Politics in the Missile Age. Admiral Howe is married to Dr. Harriet Mangrum Howe, whom he met in high school; her father, Richard C.

While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists argue that theories, hypotheses, background knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed. Postpositivists pursue objectivity by recognizing the possible effects of biases. While positivists emphasize quantitative methods, postpositivists consider both quantitative and qualitative methods to be valid approaches. Philosophy=Epistemology Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual, but rather upon human conjectures. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are warranted, or more specifically, justified by a set of warrants, which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation. However, postpositivism is not a form of relativism, and generally retains the idea of objective truth. Ontology Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly and probabilistically. Postpositivists also draw from social constructionism in forming their understanding and definition of reality. Axiology While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their axiology (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work. History Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by Henri de Saint-Simon and Auguste Comte, and logical positivism, which is most strongly associated with the Vienna Circle, which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s. Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism. One of the first thinkers to criticize logical positivism was Sir Karl Popper. He advanced falsification in lieu of the logical positivist idea of verificationism. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification. Thomas Kuhn's idea of paradigm shifts offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole worldviews that must occasionally shift in response to evidence. Postpositivism is not a rejection of the scientific method, but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques. It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of objective truth, and the use of experimental methodology. The work of philosophers Nancy Cartwright and Ian Hacking are representative of these ideas. Postpositivism of this type is described in social science guides to research methods. Structure of a postpositivist theory Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic \\"units\\" or ideas and topics of interest, \\"laws of interactions\\" among the units, and a description of the \\"boundaries\\" for the theory. A postpositivist theory also includes \\"empirical indicators\\" to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method. According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is \\"accurate\\", \\"consistent\\", \\"has broad scope\\", \\"parsimonious\\", and \\"fruitful\\".

The story was first published in the Strand Magazine in the UK and Hearst's International in the US in March 1923. Synopsis A man named Trevor Bennett comes to Holmes with a most unusual problem. He is Professor Presbury's personal secretary, and Mr Bennett is also engaged to the professor's only daughter, Edith. Professor Presbury is himself engaged to a young lady, Alice Morphy, a colleague's daughter, although he himself is already 61 years of age. Their impending marriage does not seem to have caused a great scandal, so that is not Mr Bennett's problem. Nonetheless, the trouble seems to have begun at about the time of Professor Presbury's and Alice's engagement. First, the professor suddenly left home for a fortnight without telling anyone where he was going. He returned looking rather travel-worn, and it was only through a letter from a friend sent to Mr Bennett that the family learnt that Professor Presbury had been to Prague. Upon returning from Prague, Presbury told Mr Bennett that certain letters would arrive with a cross under the stamp, and that he was not to open these. Until this time, Mr Bennett had enjoyed the professor's implicit trust and had opened all his letters as part of his job. As the professor said, such letters did arrive, and he gave them straight to the professor. Whether any replies were sent Mr Bennett does not know, as they never passed through his hands. The professor also brought a small carved wooden box back with him from Prague. One day, as Mr Bennett was looking for a cannula, he picked the box up, and the professor became very angry with him. Mr Bennett was quite shaken by the incident. The whole household feels that they are living with another man, not the Professor Presbury that they once knew. He has become furtive and sly, and there are definite changes in his moods and habits, some of which are quite bizarre; however, his mind does not seem to be adversely affected. His lectures are still brilliant, and he can still function as a professor. Mr Bennett also observed a curious behaviour in his employer. He opened his bedroom door one night, as he tells Holmes and Watson, and saw the professor crawling along the hall on his hands and feet. When he spoke to Professor Presbury, his master swore at him and scuttled off to the stairway. Edith Presbury, who arrives at 221B Baker Street halfway through her fianc√©'s interview with Holmes, says that she saw her father at her bedroom window one night at two o'clock in the morning. Her bedroom is on the second floor, and there is no long ladder in the garden. She is positive that she did not imagine this. Also, the professor's usually faithful Irish Wolfhound has taken to attacking him on occasion, and has had to be chained up outside. Holmes knows from his study of dogs that this is significant. Mr Bennett also mentions that the dog attacks happened on July 2, 11 and 20. Holmes does not mention it aloud at the time, but these are intervals of nine days. Holmes and Watson go to the university city of Camford to see the professor the next day. They decide to pretend that they have an appointment, and that if Professor Presbury does not remember making one, he will probably put it down to the dreamworld that he has recently been living in. Things do not go quite this way. The professor is quite sure that he has made no appointment, and confirms this with an embarrassed Mr Bennett. Presbury then becomes furiously angry at the intrusion, and for a minute Dr Watson thinks that they might have to fight their way out of the house. Mr Bennett, however, convinces the professor that violence against a man as well known as Sherlock Holmes would surely bring about a scandal, so Presbury allows the two visitors to depart. Holmes and Watson leave, and then Holmes confides to Watson that the visit has been worthwhile, as he has learnt much about the professor's mind, namely that it is clear and functional, despite the recent peculiar behaviour. Mr Bennett comes out of the house after Holmes and tells him that he has found the address to/from which Professor Presbury has been writing/receiving the mysterious letters. The addressee is a man named Dorak, a Central European name, which fits in with the professor's secret journey to Prague. Holmes later finds out from Mercer, his \\"general utility man\\", that Dorak is indeed a Bohemian, an elderly, suave man who keeps a large general store. Before leaving the professor's house, Holmes takes a look at Edith's bedroom window, and sees that the only possible way for someone to climb up there is by using the creeper, rather unlikely for a 61-year-old man. Holmes has formed a theory that every nine days, Professor Presbury takes some kind of drug which causes the odd behaviour. Holmes believed that he became addicted in Prague, and is now supplied by this Dorak in London. Holmes has told Mr Bennett that he and Watson will be in Camford once again on the next Tuesday. As is usual with Holmes, he does not explain why. He and Watson show up on the appointed evening, and Holmes suddenly realises something. He has observed the professor's thick and horny knuckles, and until now, has not made the connection between these, the odd behaviour, the dog's change in attitude towards his master, and the creeper. The professor is behaving like a monkey. Shortly after the realisation, Holmes and Watson are treated to a firsthand display of Professor Presbury's odd behaviour. He comes out of the house, scampers about on all fours, climbs on the creeper, and torments the tied-up dog. Unfortunately, the wolfhound gets loose and attacks the professor. The two of them, with Mr Bennett's help, manage to get the dog off the professor, but he is wounded badly. Watson and Bennett, who is also a medical man, tend to the professor's injuries. Holmes then examines the professor's little wooden box after having obtained the key from the now unconscious owner. It contained a drug, as Holmes expected, but there was also a letter there from a man named Lowenstein who, it turns out, is a quack whose help the professor sought out as a way of achieving rejuvenation, which he thought would be advisable if he were going to marry a young woman. The drug is an extract obtained from langurs, and although it has apparently given the professor renewed energy, it has also given him some of the langur's traits. Commentaries David Stuart Davies, who has written an afterword for the Case-Book, comments that this story \\"veers towards risible science fiction\\".Conan Doyle, Sir Arthur, The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes - (Collector's Library). CRW Publishing Limited (2004), p. 298 Indeed, there is something a bit less scientific in this story than is usually the case with Conan Doyle's writing. This is one of four stories said to be forged \\"drivel\\" in Nicholas Meyer's 1974 novel The Seven-Per-Cent Solution. (The other three are also from The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes.) Ancient philosophy scholar Jonathan Barnes writes of encountering the story as a child and finding it \\"one of the richest and most singular investigations of Holmes's long career ‚Äì an opinion which I have had no reason to change ... Revisited in adulthood, the story reveals itself as a sour parable about the endurance of lust, a lurid treatment of the question that is put to Falstaff as Doll Tearsheet fidgets on his knee: 'Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?'. Yet, curiously, the feeling persists that there is something in the narrative ‚Äì hidden, submerged ‚Äì which the reader is not permitted to comprehend but which forms the source of its power.\\" Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Creeping Man\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March 1923, and in the US in Hearst's International in the same month.Smith (2014), p. 186.

It featured Robin Ellis as Professor Presbury and Annabel Mullion as Alice Murphy. In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Television The story was dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV's Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. The adaptation is relatively faithful to the plot, but includes a subplot involving Inspector Lestrade investigating the theft of various primates from London's zoos: these are later revealed by Holmes to be the sources from which Dorak obtains his serum. A 2001 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was adapted from the story. Sources Lowenstein's development of a \\"rejuvenation serum\\" derived from monkeys parallels actual treatments popularised in the early twentieth century, notably those of the Russian-born surgeon Serge Voronoff, who had experimented with injections of extracts from animal glands; in the 1920s he popularised the transplantation into humans of tissue from monkey testicles.http://www.sf- encyclopedia.com/entry/voronoff_serge  References  Sources  Creeping Man, The Adventure of the 1923 short stories Works originally published in The Strand Magazine ","title":"The Adventure of the Creeping Man"},{"id":"1338158","text":"John Franklin Duncan (September 7, 1932 ‚Äì July 15, 2000) was an American bluegrass and skiffle musician. He became popular in Britain in 1957 with \\"Last Train to San Fernando\\", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Biography Duncan was born in the Windrock coal-mining camp overlooking the town of Oliver Springs, Tennessee, United States. In his teens he moved to Texas where he learned guitar and mandolin, and played in a hillbilly trio. He served in the US Air Force, and in 1952 was garrisoned in Cambridgeshire, England, where he met and married a local girl, Betty, in 1953. When performing for American servicemen at Bushey, Hertfordshire, in 1956, he was seen by Dickie Bishop, banjoist in Chris Barber's Dixieland jazz band. Barber was looking for a new vocalist to replace Lonnie Donegan, who had started a solo career, and Duncan took over the role for several months before leaving Barber's band in early 1957. Billy Bragg, Roots, Radicals and Rockers: How Skiffle Changed the World, Faber & Faber, 2017, pp. 295-296 Guided by record producer Denis Preston, Duncan then formed a new band, the Blue Grass Boys, with Donegan's former guitarist Denny Wright together with drummer Lennie Hastings and bassist Jack Fallon. They began appearing regularly on a new BBC radio show, Saturday Skiffle Club (later Saturday Club). Their first recording was a commercially unsuccessful cover version of Hank Williams' \\"Kaw-Liga\\". In 1957, their recording of a calypso called \\"Last Train To San Fernando\\" - originally co-written by Trinidadian musician Mighty Dictator (Kenneth St. Bernard) and recorded by The Duke of Iron,Bragg, 2017, pp. 323-324 was personally disliked by Duncan. The track was arranged by Wright and Fallon, who gave the piece a strong \\"country\\" feel in the erroneous belief that San Fernando was in Texas rather than Trinidad, although Wright's guitar solo has a strong Trinidadian feel to it. Duncan briefly became a star in Britain, touring with Wee Willie Harris, Cliff Richard, and American singer Marvin Rainwater, and appearing regularly on BBC radio and the TV show Six- Five Special, produced by Jack Good. Duncan had two other entries in the UK Singles Chart in 1957, with \\"Blue, Blue Heartaches\\" (No. 27) and \\"Footprints in the Snow\\" (No. 22). Although Duncan continued to record for a period of time, the skiffle fad faded and so did his success. Duncan lived in the United States in the 1960s, before returning to England where he recorded two albums in the 1970s. Following his divorce he emigrated to Australia, briefly returned to the United Kingdom, and then back to Australia where he married for a second time. He retired from the music industry and suffered from ill health, but made some further recordings in the 1990s after a revival of interest in his 1950s recordings. He died of cancer in Australia, in 2000.

Career Born in Hasselt, Belgium, Vaesen spent his first professional season at Belgian sides Cercle Brugge and K.S.C. Eendracht Aalst, and on 21 May 1998 moved to English side Huddersfield Town. He was sent off on his debut, but went on to play 135 league games. During his first season for the club, he won the club's Supporters' Player of the Year. After three years at Huddersfield, on 18 June 2001, he signed for Birmingham City. He was given the first-choice goalkeeper role at Birmingham, helping the club win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs in 2002. A memorable moment in the promotion season was saving a Gary Holt penalty in a 1‚Äì0 over Norwich City. Birmingham would go on to meet Norwich again in the play-off final and this time Vaesen saved from Philip Mulryne in the shootout. However a cruciate knee injury in March 2003 put him out of the game for nine months. During this time Maik Taylor was brought in and established himself as first-choice goalkeeper. On Christmas Eve 2003, he was loaned to Gillingham for one and a half months, during which time he participated in five games. Spells at Bradford City and Crystal Palace, with whom he took part in another play-off final victory, followed in 2004. At the end of that season he signed a new two-year contract with Birmingham, intending to compete for a first-team place. He finally dislodged Taylor in late 2005, but a 4‚Äì1 defeat at Manchester City, in which he conceded a penalty and was later sent off, proved to be his last first-team appearance before he was released at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season due to Birmingham's relegation.

Retrieved July 14, 2015 and sang professionally in Canada from the early- to mid-1950s. His international career began with his 1957 Covent Garden Riccardo in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. He continued to appear there into the 1980s, putting his personal stamp on the roles of √ân√©e in Berlioz's Les Troyens, Radam√®s in Verdi's Aida and the title role in his Don Carlos, Handel's Samson, Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio, Tristan in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Canio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, and the title role in Britten's Peter Grimes. Some critics praised Vickers' Tristan as the best since Lauritz Melchior's.Classical Music: The Listener's Companion (2002), ed. Alexander J. Morin, pp. 1038 He debuted at the Bayreuth Festival in 1958 as Siegmund in Die Walk√ºre and sang Parsifal there in 1964. Later negotiations with Wieland Wagner concerning appearances as Siegfried in G√∂tterd√§mmerung ceased on Wieland's death in 1966. His debut role at the Metropolitan Opera in 1960 was Canio in Pagliacci. He appeared at the Met for 22 seasons in 280 performances of 17 roles, including Florestan in Fidelio, Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre, Don Jose in Bizet's Carmen, Radam√®s in Aida, Erik in Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder, Herman in Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades, Samson in both Handel's oratorio and Saint-Sa√´ns' Samson et Dalila, the title role of Verdi's Otello, Don Alvaro in Verdi's La forza del destino, Peter Grimes, Tristan und Isolde, Laca in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa, Vasek in Smetana's The Bartered Bride, and the title role in Wagner's Parsifal, giving his farewell in 1987. Among Vickers' more notable recordings were Tristan und Isolde in 1972 with Herbert von Karajan becoming one of his favourite singers at the lavish Salzburg Easter and Summer Festivals in Der Ring des Nibelungen, Carmen, Otello, Fidelio as well as Tristan und Isolde, Les Troyens, singing the part of √ân√©e (Aeneas), with Sir Colin Davis in 1969,Jon Vickers: A Hero's Life (1999) by Jeannie Williams and Birgit Nilsson and a legendary and controversial 1959 recording of Handel's Messiah with Sir Thomas Beecham. Although scheduled to sing Tannh√§user at Covent Garden in the late 1970s, Vickers dropped out, claiming he could not empathize with the character, and that the opera itself was blasphemous in nature. He sang Nerone in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea at the Paris Op√©ra, and Alvaro in La forza del destino at the Met (1975). His roles also included Don Carlos, Andrea Chenier, Herod in Salome, Giasone in Medea (with Maria Callas in the title role), Pollione in Norma and rarely heard parts such as Cellini in Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini, Ratan-Sen in Roussel's Padmavati and Sergei in Shostakovitch's Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. Many critics praised his interpretation of Verdi's Otello,Chicago Classical Review (August 2009) which he recorded twice: in 1960 with Tullio Serafin and 1973 with Herbert von Karajan. Vickers also was a long time collaborator with American pianist Richard Woitach. Vickers further sang at the 'home' of Italian opera, Milan's La Scala, as well as in the major opera houses of Chicago, San Francisco, Vienna, and at the Salzburg Festival. He retired in 1988. Personal life and death Vickers was born into the musical family of William, a teacher, and Myrle (n√©e Mossop). As a youth he sang in his father's church, and his initial intention was to study medicine. He worked on a neighbour's farm and acquired the muscular stature that characterized him. During a semi-professional production his leading lady made a recording of his voice and sent it to The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He auditioned there with Every Valley Shall be Exalted and was offered a scholarship. In 1953 he married Henrietta (Hetti) Outerbridge. They had five children. After her death in 1991, he married Judith Stewart. Vickers died of Alzheimer's disease on July 10, 2015 in Ontario.

Synopsis Holmes is visited by Mrs. Merrilow, a landlady from South Brixton who has an unusual lodger who never shows her face. She saw it once accidentally and it was hideously mutilated. This woman, formerly very quiet, has recently taken to cursing in the night, shouting \\"Murder, murder!\\" and \\"You cruel beast! You monster!\\" Also, her health has taken a turn for the worse, and she is wasting away. Mrs. Merrilow has brought this case to Holmes's attention as her tenant, Mrs. Ronder, will not involve the clergy or the police in something that she would like to say. She has told her landlady to mention Abbas Parva, knowing that Holmes would understand the reference. Indeed he does. It was a most tragic case in which a circus lion somehow got loose and savaged two people, one of whom was killed, and the other badly disfigured. The latter is apparently this lodger ‚Äì the former was her husband. Holmes could make little of the case at the time, but perhaps if someone had actually hired him, the outcome would have been different. As it was, the inquest ruled that Mr. Ronder was the victim of death by misadventure. Still, even the local police were a bit disturbed at the time by some seeming inconsistencies in the accounts. For example, the lion was part of an act which Mr. and Mrs. Ronder performed right in its cage, and they were the ones who fed it. Why had it suddenly turned on its feeders? Why had it not tried to escape? Who was this man that several people heard screaming when supposedly Mr. Ronder had already been killed? Mrs. Ronder wearing her veil Upon arriving at Brixton, Holmes and Watson are shown into Mrs. Ronder's room, which she seldom leaves. She is wearing her veil. Her purpose, it seems, is to make a clean breast of the matter before she dies. She tell Holmes and Watson that Mr. Ronder was a terrible husband, cruel and violent in the extreme, even to the circus animals, but he didn't care, even though he wound up in the dock for it several times. He was very rich and the fines meant nothing. Mrs. Ronder also had an extramarital lover in Leonardo, the circus strongman. He was always very supportive and encouraging to his lover, who felt that Leonardo was the only man her husband feared. Eventually, Mrs. Ronder and Leonardo realized that Mr. Ronder was not fit to live, and formed a plan to eradicate him. As part of the plan, Leonardo made a club with five nails in it, which could deliver wounds that might be mistaken for those of a lion's paw. Then one night at Abbas Parva, a small village in Berkshire where the circus was camped for the night, Mrs. Ronder and Leonardo carried out their plan. When Mrs. Ronder and her husband went to the lion's cage to feed it, Leonardo crept up behind them and smashed Mr. Ronder's head with the club, and Mrs. Ronder released the lion to make it appear that it had broken free and done the deed. But the lion, having been riven into a feeding frenzy by the scent of Mr. Ronder's blood, turned and pounced on Mrs. Ronder instead, badly chewing her face up in the process. At the sight of this, Leonardo started screaming and ran to get help from the other circus members. He could have saved his lover himself by using the club on the lion, but he was too cowardly. Mrs. Ronder could not bring herself to implicate Leonardo in her husband's murder at the inquest, and is only now telling Holmes and Watson this story because she believes that she will soon die. She never saw or heard of Leonardo again, and later learned that he had drowned. Ever since the night of the incident, she has lived alone and veiled. Holmes can only offer advice in this situation; realising that Mrs. Ronder is contemplating suicide, he reminds her that her life is worth something as an example of patient suffering in an impatient world. She responds to this by lifting her veil, and the sight is ghastly. Nevertheless, Holmes receives a bottle of prussic acid from Mrs. Ronder two days later. She was going to use it to kill herself, but upon considering what Holmes told her, she apparently thought better of it.

The story is part of the short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in the US in Liberty in March 1927. It was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1927. The original title \\"The Adventure of the Black Spaniel\\" was changed before publication. Plot Cover of The Strand Magazine featuring the publication of the last Sherlock Holmes story written by Arthur Conan Doyle: \\"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\\". Head trainer John Mason from Shoscombe Old Place, a racing stable in Berkshire, comes to Holmes about his master, Sir Robert Norberton. Mason thinks he has gone mad. Sir Robert's sister, Lady Beatrice Falder, owns Shoscombe, but it will revert to her late husband's brother when she dies. The stable has a horse, Shoscombe Prince, who Sir Robert hopes will win the Derby. He would be out of debt if that actually happened. Mason is not quite sure what he wants Holmes to investigate, but a number of odd changes have happened at the stable: *Why has Lady Beatrice suddenly forgone her usual habit of stopping to greet her favourite horse? Why does she just ride on by in her carriage? *Why has Sir Robert become so wild- eyed lately? *Why has he given his sister's dog away to a neighbourhood innkeeper? *Why does he go to the old crypt at night, and who is that man that he meets there? *Why have burnt human bones been found in the furnace at Shoscombe? Holmes decides to investigate on the spot. He and Dr. Watson go to Berkshire posing as anglers and learn some interesting things. The keeper of the inn where they are staying is the one who now has Lady Beatrice's dog, and it is quite an expensive breed, one that an innkeeper ordinarily could never afford. With the innkeeper's permission, Holmes takes the dog for a walk, and goes to Shoscombe, where he releases it as Lady Beatrice's carriage comes out of the gate. The dog dashes forward enthusiastically at first, but then flees in terror. Then, even though a maid and Lady Beatrice are supposedly the only two people in the carriage, it is a male voice that yells \\"Drive on!\\" Then there is the crypt. John Mason observes that a heap of bones there earlier is now gone. Holmes finds a coffin with a fresh, swathed body in it. Just then, Sir Robert arrives, catching Holmes and Watson in the act. After Holmes makes it plain that he has deduced most of the odd goings-on, Sir Robert invites him and Watson back to the house and explains everything. About a week earlier, Lady Beatrice died of dropsy, and Sir Robert felt compelled to keep the fact secret so that the creditors would not swoop down on Shoscombe before he had a chance to win the Derby and pay off all his debts. He and the maid's husband hid the body in the crypt, but also found that they had to dispose of an older body--in the furnace. This same man also dressed up in Lady Beatrice's clothes and took her place in the carriage each day. The dog knew what had happened and might have given the game away if its noise had aroused suspicion. Holmes refers the matter to the police, but the story ends happily. Shoscombe Prince wins the Derby, Sir Robert escapes any major judicial penalty for what he did to his sister's body, and he pays off all his debts with a great deal left over.

Plot Sherlock Holmes is hired by a retired art supply dealer from Lewisham, Josiah Amberley, to look into his wife's disappearance. She has left with a neighbour, Dr. Ray Ernest, taking a sizeable quantity of cash and securities. Amberley wants the two tracked down. Holmes is too busy with another case at the moment; so he sends Dr. Watson to Lewisham to observe what he can, although Watson is keenly aware that this is more Holmes's province. He does his best, observing that Amberley is busy painting his house, which seems a bit odd. He even sees Amberley's wife's unused theatre ticket; she and her young man disappeared while Amberley went to the theatre alone after his wife complained of a headache. Watson notes the seat number. Watson also sees Amberley's strongroom from which his wife had taken the valuables. She, apparently, had a key of her own. He meets a lounger with a rather military appearance in the street, and later observes him running to catch the train at Blackheath Station as he is returning to 221B Baker Street. Holmes recognises the description; it is his rival in detection, Barker. It later turns out that Ray Ernest's family has hired him to find the missing doctor. A number of other things about Amberley are obvious. He is a miser, and as such is quite a jealous man. He is an avid chess player (indeed, so is Ernest, which is how they became acquainted), suggesting to Holmes that he also has a scheming mind. Holmes suspects something, and so sends Watson and Amberley on a fool's errand to the remote village of Little Purlington, near Frinton in Essex, just to keep Amberley out of the way while Holmes breaks into his house to investigate it. He is \\"caught\\" by Barker, but they decide to work together. They reach a conclusion, and later Holmes confronts Amberley with the dramatic question \\"What did you do with the bodies?\\" Holmes manhandles Amberley just in time to stop him taking a poison pill. Amberley is obviously guilty. Holmes explains how he reached his conclusion. Amberley's alibi fell apart when Holmes discovered that his seat at the Haymarket Theatre had not been occupied on the night in question, its number deduced from the ticket that Watson had seen. Also, the painting was a clue. Holmes realised that it was being done to mask a smell, and he soon discovered what that was: gas. He found a gas pipe leading into the strongroom with a tap outside. Amberley had lured his wife and her lover--for so he had believed Dr. Ernest to be--into the strongroom, locked them in, and turned the gas on, killing them out of jealousy. He had simply hidden the \\"stolen\\" valuables somewhere. In indelible pencil, one of the victims wrote \\"We we‚Ä¶\\", perhaps meaning to write \\"We were murdered.\\" The bodies are found in a disused well in the garden, hidden under a dog kennel, just where Holmes suggested that the police look. Amberley apparently hired Holmes out of \\"pure swank\\", believing that no-one would ever find him out. Holmes believes that Amberley will likely end up at Broadmoor rather than on the scaffold, owing to his mental state.

He was a leading theologian of his day who is now best known as the spokesman for Catholic opposition to the teachings of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation while he was the Pope's Legate in Augsburg, and perhaps also among Catholics for his extensive commentary on the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. He is not to be confused with his contemporary, Saint Cajetan, the founder of the Theatines. Life De Vio was born in Gaeta, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, as Jacopo Vio. The name Tommaso was taken as a monastic name, while the surname Cajetan derives from his native city. At the age of fifteen he entered the Dominican order and devoted himself to the study of the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, becoming before the age of thirty a doctor of theology at Padua, and subsequently professor of metaphysics. A public disputation at Ferrara (1494) with Pico della Mirandola made his reputation as a theologian. He became general procurator in 1507 and general of the Dominicans a year later in 1508. For his zeal in defending the papal rights against the 1511 Council of Pisa, in a series of works which were condemned by the Sorbonne and publicly burnt by order of King Louis XII, he obtained the bishopric of Gaeta, and in 1517 Pope Leo X made him a cardinal and archbishop of Palermo. He appears in 1511 as a supporter of the pope against the claims of the Council of Pisa (1511-1512), called by dissident cardinals to punish Pope Julius II, who had ignored the electoral capitulations he had accepted before being elected. Cajetan composed in defense of his position the Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Pap√¶ et conciliorum ad invicem. Jacques Almain answered this work, and Cajetan replied in his Apologia. Cajetan refused to accept Almain's argument that the Church's polity had to be similar to a lay regime, complete with limits on the ruler.Thomas M. Izbicki, \\"Cajetan's Attack on Parallel's Between Church and State,\\" Cristianesimo nella storia 29 (1999): 81-89. At the Fifth Lateran Council (1512‚Äì17) which Pope Julius II set up in opposition to that of Pisa, De Vio played the leading role. During the second session of the council, in which he gave the opening oration, he brought about a decree recognizing the superiority of papal authority to that of councils. In 1517, Leo X made him cardinal presbyter of San Sisto in Rome for his services. In the following year he became bishop of Palermo. He resigned as bishop of Palermo in 1519 to become bishop of Gaeta, as granted him by the Emperor Charles V for whose election De Vio had labored zealously. The meeting of Cajetan (left) and Martin Luther (right). In 1518 he was sent as legate to the Diet of Augsburg and to him, at the wish of the Saxon elector, was entrusted the task of examining and testing the teachings of Luther. According to Hilaire Belloc, \\"[Luther] had not been treated roughly by his opponents, the roughness had been on his side. But things had gone against him, and he had been made to look foolish; he had been cross-examined into denying, for instance, the authority of a General Council ‚Äì which authority was the trump card to play against the Papacy.\\" In 1519, De Vio helped in drawing up the bill of excommunication against Luther. De Vio was employed in several other negotiations and transactions, being as able in business as in letters. In conjunction with Cardinal Giulio de' Medici in the conclave of 1521‚Äë1522, he secured the election of Adrian Boeyens, bishop of Tortosa, as Adrian VI. He retained influence under Clement VII, suffered a short term of imprisonment after the storming of Rome by the Constable of Bourbon and by Frundsberg (1527), retired to his bishopric for a few years, and, returning to Rome in 1530, assumed his old position of influence with Pope Clement, in whose behalf he wrote the decision rejecting the appeal for divorce from Catharine of Aragon made by Henry VIII of England. Nominated by Clement VII a member of the committee of cardinals appointed to report on the \\"Nuremberg Recess\\", he recommended, in opposition to the majority, certain concessions to the Lutherans, notably the marriage of the clergy as in the Greek Church and communion in both kinds according to the decision of the council of Basel. Cardinal De Vio died in Rome in 1534. Views Opuscula omnia, 1596 As a philosopher and logician, Cajetan defended the idea of analogy.Joshua P. Hochschild, The semantics of analogy: rereading Cajetan's De nominum analogia (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2010). Though as a theologian De Vio was a scholastic of the older Thomist type, his general position was that of the moderate reformers of the school to which Reginald Pole, later archbishop of Canterbury, also belonged; i.e., he desired to retain the best elements of the humanist revival in harmony with Catholic orthodoxy illumined by a revived appreciation of the Augustinian doctrine of justification. In the field of Thomistic philosophy, he showed striking independence of judgment, expressing liberal views on marriage and divorce, denying the existence of a material Hell and advocating the celebration of public prayers in the vernacular. Some Dominicans regarded his views as too independent of those of Saint Thomas. The Sorbonne in Paris found some of these views heterodox, and in the 1570 edition of his celebrated commentary on Aquinas' Summa, the objectionable passages were expunged. In this spirit he wrote commentaries upon portions of Aristotle and upon the Summa of Aquinas, and towards the end of his life made a careful translation of the Old and New Testaments, excepting Solomon's Song, the Prophets and the Revelation of St John. Cajetan also wrote opinions on subjects of practical importance, such as the disposition of plundered goods the ownership of which could not be determined.Thomas M. Izbicki, ‚ÄúCajetan on the Acquisition of Stolen Goods in the Old and New Worlds,‚Äù Rivista di Storia del Cristianesimo 4 (2007): 499-509. Of the Reformation he remained a steadfast opponent, composing several works directed against Martin Luther,Cajetan Responds A Reader in Reformation Controversy, ed. Jared Wicks (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1978. and taking an important part in shaping the policy of the papal delegates in Germany. Learned though he was in the scholastics, he recognized that to fight the reformers he would need a deeper knowledge of the Scriptures than he possessed. To this study he devoted himself with characteristic zeal, wrote commentaries on the greater part of the Old and the New Testament, and in the exposition of his text, which he treated critically, allowed himself considerable latitude in departing from literal and traditional interpretations. De Vio is reported as making a statement some might find controversial: In contrast to the majority of Italian cardinals of his day, De Vio was a man of austere piety and fervent zeal. And from the standpoint of the Dominican idea of the supreme necessity of maintaining ecclesiastical discipline, he defended the rights of the papacy and proclaimed that the pope should be \\"the mirror of God on earth.\\" Modern assessment In the mid-twentieth century, Cajetan's thought came to be assessed negatively by certain Catholic commentators who, in reacting against the then-regnant neo- Thomist thought, portrayed Cajetan as the first person to make mistaken interpretations of the thought of Thomas Aquinas ‚Äì interpretations which, in their (different) narratives, lingered into the twentieth century. For √âtienne Gilson, who was responding to arguments that 'philosophy' and 'Christianity' were incompatible disciplines, there existed in Hellenistic Judaism, patristic thought and the medieval period a way of thinking, animated by the ancient Greek quest for the cause of being, which could rightly be called 'Christian philosophy'. In Gilson's account, it was in Cajetan's thought that this link was first broken, since Cajetan, contaminated by Scotism, reduced Thomas Aquinas's metaphysics of the existential act of being to an ontology of substance. Cajetan and his successors therefore, in Gilson's account, represented Thomas as focused on the forms and essences of beings only, and not on the existence of all things as participation in the pure actuality which is God. Accordingly, for Gilson, 'philosophy' and 'Christianity' are only incompatible if Christian thought is understood in its tradition post- Cajetan ‚Äì a tradition which is worse than the older, more distinguished tradition of Christian thought.F Kerr, After Aquinas, (2002), pp80-3 For Henri de Lubac, who in Surnaturel (1946) was trying to provide a historical account of what he saw the emergence of a mistaken reading of the relationship between the natural and supernatural in Thomas Aquinas, it was Cajetan who made the misinterpretation which affected all subsequent interpretation of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, de Lubac argued, assumed that Thomas was an Aristotelian, working with a definition of nature from Aristotle's Physics, which effectively turned human nature into a reality essentially closed in on itself, with its own intrinsic powers, desires and goals. This move, argued de Lubac, led subsequent Catholic thought to produce mistaken readings of Thomas Aquinas's account of the relationship between nature and grace. F Kerr, After Aquinas, (2002), p136 However, Ralph McInerny and other scholars have challenged the negative assessment of Cajetan's work made by Lubac and Gilson. McInerny writes that the criticisms of Cajetan are not in fact supported by evidence from his works, and furthermore that it is not Cajetan but Gilson whose interpretation of Aquinas is a departure from the latter's own beliefs.

The Andamanese peoples are among the various groups considered Negrito, owing to their dark skin and diminutive stature. All Andamanese traditionally lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and appear to have lived in substantial isolation for thousands of years. It is suggested that the Andamanese settled in the Andaman Islands around the latest glacial maximum, around 26,000 years ago. The Andamanese peoples included the Great Andamanese and Jarawas of the Great Andaman archipelago, the Jangil of Rutland Island, the Onge of Little Andaman, and the Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island. At the end of the 18th century, when they first came into sustained contact with outsiders, an estimated 7,000 Andamanese remained. In the next century, they were largely wiped out by diseases, violence, and loss of territory. Today, only roughly 400‚Äì450 Andamanese remain, with the Jangil being extinct. Only the Jarawa and the Sentinelese maintain a steadfast independence, refusing most attempts at contact by outsiders. The Andamanese are a designated Scheduled Tribe in India's constitution. History Until the late 18th century, the Andamanese culture, language, and genetics were preserved from outside influences by their fierce reaction to visitors, which included killing any shipwrecked foreigners, and by the remoteness of the islands. The various tribes and their mutually unintelligible languages thus are believed to have evolved on their own over millennia. Origins Map of human haplotype migration based on mitochondrial DNA, with Key (coloured) indicating periods in numbered thousands of years before the present. Note the route of the mtDNA haplogroup M through the Indian mainland and the Andaman Islands, possibly on to Southeast Asia According to Chaubey and Endicott (2013), the Andaman Islands were settled less than 26,000 years ago, by people who were not direct descendants of the first migrants out of Africa. According to Wang et al. (2011), It was previously assumed that the Andaman ancestors were part of the initial Great Coastal Migration that was the first expansion of humanity out of Africa, via the Arabian peninsula, along the coastal regions of the Indian mainland and toward Southeast Asia, China, and Oceania. The Andamanese were considered to be a pristine example of a hypothesized Negrito population, which showed similar physical characteristics, and was supposed to have existed throughout southeast Asia. The existence of a specific Negrito- population is nowadays doubted. Their commonalities could be the result of evolutionary convergence and/or a shared history. Bulbeck (2013) shows the Andamanese maternal mtDNA is entirely mitochondrial Haplogroup M. Their Y-DNA belong to the D haplogroup which has not been seen outside of the Andamans, a fact that underscores the insularity of these tribes. Analysis of mtDNA, which is inherited exclusively by maternal descent, confirms the above results. All Onge belong to mtDNA haplogroup M, which is unique to Onge people. This haplogroup, which is descended from Africa, represents the entire lineage of the Onge and Adamanese, and is the predominant mtDNA among the Semang in Malaysia. Moreover, haplogroup M is the single most common mtDNA haplogroup in Asia, where it represents 60% of all maternal lineages.name=\\"petraglia2007\\"> A 2017 study by Mondal et al. finds that the Riang lineage of D1a3 (a Tibeto- Burmese population) and the Andamanese D1a3 have their nearest related lineages in East Asia. The Jarawa and Onge shared this D1a3 lineage with each other within the last ~7000 years, but had diverged from the Japanese D1a2 lineage ~53000 years ago\\". They further suggest that: ‚ÄúThis strongly suggests that haplogroup D does not indicate a separate ancestry for Andamanese populations. Rather, haplogroup D was part of the standing variation carried by the OOA expansion, and later lost from most of the populations except in Andaman and partially in Japan and Tibet‚Äù. Population decline An official 1867 British government communication about organizing a punitive expedition against Andamanese tribespeople on Little Andaman Island The Andamanese's protective isolation changed with the first British colonial presence and subsequent settlements, which proved disastrous for them. Lacking immunity against common infectious diseases of the Eurasian mainland, the large Jarawa habitats on the southeastern regions of South Andaman Island likely were depopulated by disease within four years (1789‚Äì1793) of the initial British colonial settlement in 1789. Epidemics of pneumonia, measles and influenza spread rapidly and exacted heavy tolls, as did alcoholism. In the 19th century, the measles killed 50% of the Andamanese population.Measles hits rare Andaman tribe . BBC News. 16 May 2006. By 1875, the Andamanese were already \\"perilously close to extinction,\\" yet attempts to contact, subdue and co-opt them continued unrelentingly. In 1888, the British government set in place a policy of \\"organized gift giving\\" that continued in varying forms until well into the 20th century. Great Andamanese men, women and children, 1876 There is evidence that some sections of the British Indian administration were working deliberately to annihilate the tribes. After the mid-19th century, British established penal colonies on the islands and an increasing number of mainland Indian and Karen settlers arrived, encroaching on former territories of the Andamanese. This accelerated the decline of the tribes. Many Andamanese succumbed to British expeditions to avenge the killing of shipwrecked sailors. In the 1867 Andaman Islands Expedition, dozens of Onge were killed by British naval personnel following the death of shipwrecked sailors, which resulted in four Victoria Crosses for the British soldiers. In 1923, the British ornithologist and anthropologist Frank Finn, who visited the islands in the 1890s, while working for the Indian Museum, described the Andamanese as \\"The World's Most Primitive People\\", writing: In the 1940s, the Jarawa were bombed by imperial Japanese forces for their hostility. This attack of the Japanese was criticized as war crime by many observers. Recent history In 1974, a film crew and anthropologist Triloknath Pandit attempted friendly contact by leaving a tethered pig, some pots and pans, some fruit, and toys on the beach at North Sentinel Island. One of the islanders shot the film director in the thigh with an arrow. The following year, European visitors were repulsed with arrows.Pandit On 2 August 1981, the Hong Kong freighter ship Primrose grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef. A few days later, crewmen on the immobile vessel observed that small black men were carrying spears and arrows and building boats on the beach. The captain of the Primrose radioed for an urgent airdrop of firearms so the crew could defend themselves, but did not receive them. Heavy seas kept the islanders away from the ship. After a week, the crew were rescued by an Indian navy helicopter. On 4 January 1991, Triloknath Pandit made the first known friendly contact with the Sentinelese. Until 1996, the Jarawa met most visitors with flying arrows. From time to time, they attacked and killed poachers on the lands reserved to them by the Indian government. They also killed some workers building the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR), which traverses Jarawa lands. One of the earliest peaceful contacts with the Jarawa occurred in 1996. Settlers found a teenaged Jarawa boy named Enmei near Kadamtala town. The boy was immobilized with a broken foot. They took Enmei to a hospital, where he received good care. Over several weeks, Enmei learned a few words of Hindi before returning to his jungle home. The following year, Jarawa individuals and small groups began appearing along roadsides and occasionally venturing into settlements to steal food. The ATR may have interfered with traditional Jarawa food sources. On 17 November 2018, a United States missionary, John Allen Chau, was killed when he tried to introduce Christianity to the Sentinelese tribe. The Sentinelese have been protected from contact with the outside world. Trips to the Island are prohibited by Indian law. Chau was brought near the island by local fishermen, who were later arrested during the investigation into his death. Indian authorities attempted to retrieve Chau's remains without success. Tribes Distribution of Andamanese tribes in the Andaman Islands ‚Äî early 1800s versus present-day (2004). The five major groups of Andamanese are: * Great Andamanese, traditionally of the Great Andaman archipelago but now living on Strait Island. Their population was 52 as of 2010.\\"Language lost as last member of Andaman tribe dies\\" (5 February 2010). The Daily Telegraph, London. Accessed 3 January 2017. * Jarawa traditionally of the southern part of South Andaman Island in the Great Andaman archipelago but now living in the ex-Great Andamanese homeland in the West Coast and central parts of South and Middle Andaman Islands. Their population was 380 as of 2011.http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A11_Appendix/ST-35-PCA-A11-APPENDIX.xlsx * Jangil or Rutland Jarawa of Rutland Island, extinct by 1921 * Onge of Little Andaman, at 101 individuals as of 2011. * Sentinelese of North Sentinel Island, estimated to be 100 to 200 individuals. By the end of the eighteenth century, there were an estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living on Great Andaman. Altogether they comprised ten distinct tribes with different languages. The population quickly dwindled to 600 in 1901 and to 19 by 1961. It has increased slowly after that, following their move to a reservation on Strait Island. As of 2010, the population was 52, representing a mix of the former tribes. The Jarawa originally inhabited southeastern Jarawa Island and have migrated to the west coast of Great Andaman in the wake of the Great Andamanese. The Onge once lived throughout Little Andaman and now are confined to two reservations on the island. The Jangil, who originally inhabited Rutland Island, were extinct by 1931; the last individual was sighted in 1907. Only the Sentinelese are still living in their original homeland on North Sentinel Island, largely undisturbed, and have fiercely resisted all attempts at contact.  Languages  The Andamanese languages are considered to be the fifth language family of India, following the Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Sino-Tibetan. While some connections have been tentatively proposed with other language families, the consensus view is currently that Andamanese languages form a separate language family ‚Äì or rather, two unrelated linguistic families: Greater Andamanese and Ongan. Culture hunting turtles with bows and arrows. Until contact, the Andamanese were strict hunter-gatherers. They did not practice cultivation, and lived off hunting indigenous pigs, fishing, and gathering. Their only weapons were the bow, adzes, and wooden harpoons. With the Aboriginal Tasmanians, the Andamanese were one of only two peoples who in the nineteenth century knew of no method for making fire. They instead carefully preserved embers in hollowed-out trees from fires caused by lightning strikes. The men wore girdles made of hibiscus fiber which carried useful tools and weapons for when they went hunting. The women on the other hand wore a tribal dress containing leaves that were held by a belt. A majority of them had painted bodies as well. They usually slept on leaves or mats and had either permanent or temporary habitation among the tribes. All habitations were man made. Some of the tribe members were credited to having supernatural powers. They were called oko-pai-ad, which meant dreamer. They were thought to have an influence on the members of the tribe and would bring misfortune to those who did not believe in their abilities. Traditional knowledge practitioners were the ones who helped with healthcare. The medicine that was used to cure illnesses were herbal most of the time. Various types of medicinal plants were used by the islanders. 77 total traditional knowledge practitioners were identified and 132 medicinal plants were used. The members of the tribes found various ways to use leaves in their everyday lives including clothing, medicine, and to sleep on. Anthropologist A.R. Radcliffe Brown argued that the Andamanese had no government and made decisions by group consensus.  Religion  The native Andamanese religion and belief system is a form of Animism. Ancestor worship is an important element in the religious traditions of the Andaman islands. Physical appearance= Phenotype  A young Onge mother with her baby, Andaman Islands, British India, 1905. Negritos, specifically Andamanese, are grouped together by phenotype and anthropological features. Three physical features that distinguish the Andaman islanders include: skin colour, hair, and stature. Those of the Andaman islands have dark skin, are short in stature, and have \\"frizzy\\" hair.  Dental morphology  Dental characteristics also group the Andamanese between Negrito and East-Asian samples. When comparing dental morphology the focus is on overall size and tooth shape. To measure the size and shape, Penrose's size and shape statistic is used. To calculate tooth size, the sum of the tooth area is taken. Factor analysis is applied to tooth size to achieve tooth shape. Results have shown that the dental morphology of Andaman Islanders resembles that of South Asians, whereas Philippine Negrito groups more closely resemble southeast Asians in their dental morphology. Therefore, the dental morphology of the Andamanese indicates a retention of dental morphology from early South Asians in the early-mid Holocene. Overall the dental morphology of the Andamanese is found to be distant from that of modern East Asians. However it is noted that the tooth size of the Andamanese is similar to that of the Han Chinese and Japanese. Genetics \\"Scarification pattern among the Great Andamanese in the late 19th century. Nothing is known of the origins or antiquity of this custom among the Andamanese.\\" Genetic analysis, both of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA provide information about the origins of the Andamanese. The Andamanese are most genetically similar to the Malaysian Negrito tribes. Nuclear DNA The Andamanese show a very small genetic variation, which is indicative of populations that have experienced a population bottleneck and then developed in isolation for a long period. An allele has been discovered among the Jarawas that is found nowhere else in the world. Blood samples of 116 Jarawas were collected and tested for Duffy blood group and malarial parasite infectivity. Results showed a total absence of both Fya and Fyb antigens in two areas (Kadamtala and R.K Nallah) and low prevalence of both Fya antigen in another two areas (Jirkatang and Tirur). There was an absence of malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax infection though Plasmodium falciparum infection was present in 27¬∑59% of cases. A very high frequency of Fy (a‚Äìb‚Äì) in the Jarawa tribe from all the four jungle areas of Andaman Islands along with total absence of P. vivax infections suggests the selective advantage offered to Fy (a‚Äìb‚Äì) individuals against P. vivax infection. Overall, the Andamanese showed closest relations with other Oceanic populations. The Nicobarese in contrast were observed to share close genetic relations with adjacent Indo-Mongoloid populations of Northeast India and Myanmar. Bulbeck (2013) likewise noted that the Andamanese's nuclear DNA clusters with that of other Andamanese Islanders, as they carry a unique branch of Haplogroup D (D1a3) and maternal M (mtDNA). Genomic The use of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) shows that the genome of Andamanese people is closest to those of other Oceanic Negrito groups and distinct from South Asians and East Asians. Analysis of mtDNA, which is inherited exclusively by maternal descent, confirms the above results. All Onge belong to M32 mtDNA, a subgroup of M which is unique to Onge people. According to Reich et al. (2009). South Asian populations of the Indian subcontinent are composed, to significantly varying degrees, of mixtures of ancestry from: a group (known as \\"ASI\\" or \\"Ancestral South Indian\\") closest to but distinct from Andaman islanders, and populations from Western Eurasia (comprising a component termed \\"ANI\\" or \\"Ancestral North Indian\\"). Reich et al. speculate that the Andamanese split from mainland Asia 1,700 generations ago. Andamanese are the only South Asian population in the study that lacked any Ancestral North Indian admixture. According to Basu et al. (2016), the populations of the Andaman Islands archipelago form a distinct ancestry, which is \\"coancestral to Oceanic populations and not close to South Asians (India).\\" They conclude that the Andamanese, though they may be the closest existing group to the ancient \\"ASI\\" ancestral component in modern South Asians, have a distinct ancestry and are not closely related to other South Asians but are closer to Southeast Asian Negritos. Moorjani et al. 2013 state that the \\"ASI\\" component in South Asians, though not closely related to any living group, is \\"related (distantly) to indigenous Andaman Islanders.\\" Moorjani et al. also suggest possible gene flow into the Andamanese from a population related to the ASI. The study concluded that ‚Äúalmost all groups speaking Indo-European or Dravidian languages lie along a gradient of varying relatedness to West Eurasians in PCA (referred to as ‚ÄúIndian cline‚Äù)‚Äù. A genetic analysis from Chaubey et al. 2015 found evidence of East Asian (Han Chinese-related) ancestry in Andamanese people. They estimated 32% East Asian ancestry in the Onge and 31% in the Great Andamanese, but suggest that this finding may in fact reflect the genetic affinity of the Andamanese to Melanesian and Southeast Asian Negrito populations rather than true East Asian admixture (stating that \\"The Han ancestry measured in Andaman Negrito is probably partially capturing both Melanesian and Malaysian Negrito ancestry\\"), as a previous study by Chaubey et al. suggested \\"a deep common ancestry\\" between Andamanese, Melanesians and other Negrito groups (as well as South Asians), and an affinity between Southeast Asian Negritos and Melanesians with East Asians. McColl et al. (2018) Analysed 26 ancient samples from Southeast Asia and Japan spanning from the late Neolithic to the Iron Age, along with an ancient Ikawazu J≈çmon sample from southeast Honshu.The Jomon female skeleton which was analyzed shows typical J≈çmon morphology.https://www.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/latest-research/59409 However this J≈çmon individual partially shares some ancestry with prehistoric Hoabinhians, which in turn also share some ancestry with the Onge, Jehai (Peninsular Malaysia) in mainland Southeast Asia along with Indian groups and Papua New Guineans, which represents possible gene flow from that group into the J≈çmon population. The J≈çmon individual is best modeled as a mix of H√≤ab√¨nhian (La368) and East Asian ancestry while present-day East Asians can be modeled as a mixture of an √ñnge-like population and a population related to the Ti√°nyu√°n individual.Fig. 3 Admixture graphs fitting ancient Southeast Asian genomeshttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6397/88 However, there is still lack of ancient genome data to understand the peopling history of East Eurasians. It is required to analyze more ancient genome data, if there found appropriate skeletons, in order to fill the gap and to prove the speculation.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/15/579177.full.pdf A study by concludes that ANI and ASI were formed in the 2nd millennium BCE, and were preceded by a mixture of AASI (Ancient Ancestral South Indian, i.e. hunter-gatherers sharing a common root with the Andamanese); and Iranian agriculturalists who arrived in India ca. 4700‚Äì3000 BCE, and \\"must have reached the Indus Valley by the 4th millennium BCE\\". Narasimhan et al. observe that samples from the Indus periphery population are always mixes of the same two proximal sources of AASI and Iranian agriculturalist-related ancestry; with \\"one of the Indus Periphery individuals having ~42% AASI ancestry and the other two individuals having ~14-18% AASI ancestry\\" (with the remainder of their ancestry being from the Iranian agriculturalist-related population). According Narasimhan the genetic makeup of the ASI population consisted of about 73% AASI and about 27% from Iran-related peoples. Another genetic study by Yelmen et al. (2019) shows that the native South Asian genetic component is distinct from the Andamanese and thus that the Andamanese (Onge) are an imperfect and imprecise proxy for \\"ASI\\" ancestry in South Asians (there is difficulty detecting ASI ancestry in the North Indian Gujarati when the Andamanese Onge are used). Yemen et al. suggest that the South Indian tribal Paniya people would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \\"native South Asian\\" component in modern South Asians. Two more recent genetic studies (Shinde et al. 2019 and Narasimhan et al. 2019) on remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age northwest India and east Pakistan) found them to have a mixed ancestry: The samples analyzed by Shinde et al. had about 50-98% of their genome from Iranian hunter-gatherer peoples, which were also ancestral to Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% from South-east Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese, with the Iranian ancestry being on average predominant. The samples analyzed by Narasimhan et al. had 45‚Äì82% Iranian-related ancestry and 11‚Äì50% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \\"Steppe ancestry\\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India. The authors found that the respective amounts of those ancestries varied significantly between individuals, and concluded that more samples are needed to get the full picture of Indian population history. Further Narasimhan et al. 2019 notes that the high correlation between Dravidian and ASI ancestry may suggest that the Dravidians originated from the AASI component and are native to peninsular South Asia (south and east India). Y DNA haplogroup D branches. The male Y-chromosome in humans is inherited exclusively through paternal descent. All sampled males of Onges (23/23) and Jarawas (4/4) belong to Paragroup D-M174*(D1a3). However, male Great Andamanese do not appear to carry these clades. A low resolution study suggests that they belong to haplogroups K, L, O and P1 (P-M45). A 2017 study by Mondal et al. finds that Andamanese D lineages diverged from Japanese D lineages lineage ~53000 years ago\\" and that Andamanese D lineages and those of the Riang (a Tibeto-Burmese population) have their nearest related lineages in East Asia, also finding that the D lineages of the Jarawa and Onge (both Andamanese groups) share a common ancestry more recently, within the last ~7000 years. They further suggest that: ‚ÄúThis strongly suggests that haplogroup D does not indicate a separate ancestry for Andamanese populations. Rather, haplogroup D was part of the standing variation carried by the OOA expansion, and later lost from most of the populations except in Andaman and partially in Japan and Tibet‚Äù. Mitochondrial DNA Analysis of mtDNA, which is inherited exclusively by maternal descent, confirms the above results. The Onge and all the Adamanan Islanders belong strictly to the mitochondrial Haplogroup M. All Andamanese belong to M31 and M32 mtDNA, a subgroup of M which is unique to Andamanese people. The analysis of 20 coding regions in 20 samples of ancient Andamanese people and 12 samples of modern Indian populations changed the topology of the two lineages in South Asians. The data received suggests an M31a lineage in South Asians and in East Asians. Other mainland specific subgroups of M are distributed in Asia, where they represent 60% of all maternal lineages. According to Endicott et al. (2002), this haplogroup originated with the earliest settlers of India during the coastal migration that may have brought the ancestors of the Andamanese to the Indian mainland, the Andaman Islands, and farther afield to Southeast Asia. Archaic Admixture Unlike some Negrito populations of Southeast Asia, Andaman Islanders have not been found to have Denisovan ancestry. However, they are estimated, like all other non- African populations, to possess approximately 1-2% Neanderthal ancestry. A study suggests that all Asian and Australo-Papuan populations, including Andaman Islanders, also share between 2.6 and 3.4% of the genetic profile of a previously unknown hominin that was genetically roughly equidistant to Denisovans and Neanderthals. However, a 2018 study by Skoglund et al. lead by the Harvard Reich lab team did not replicate that result and did not find evidence for admixture from an unknown hominin in the Andamanese or other Asians. Wall et al. 2019 also did not find evidence of unknown archaic hominin admixture in Andamanese.

The North Shore consists of many affluent suburbs north of Chicago, Illinois, bordering the shores of Lake Michigan. These communities fall within suburban Cook County and Lake County. The North Shore's membership is often a topic of debate, and is sometimes expanded to include other nearby Chicago suburbs which do not border Lake Michigan. However, Skokie Evanston, Northbrook, Glenview, Northfield, Glencoe, Highland Park, Deerfield, Kenilworth, Lake Bluff, Lake Forest, Wilmette, and Winnetka are generally considered to be the main constituents of the North Shore.  Communities and their years of settlement and incorporation  Many credit Walter S. Gurnee as the father of the North Shore. One of the earliest known monographs to be devoted to the North Shore, The Book of the North Shore (1910), and its companion volume, The Second Book of the North Shore (1911), were written by Marian A. White, whose husband J. Harrison White had established a weekly newspaper in Rogers Park in 1895 called the North Shore Suburban.

The region began to be developed into towns following the opening of Northwestern University in Evanston in 1855 and the founding of Lake Forest College two years later, and the construction and launch of railroads serving the colleges and their towns. Electric rail lines were also run from Chicago, parallel to steam commuter lines, and streetcars flourished throughout the suburbs from Evanston on north. The North Shore today is noteworthy for being one of the few remaining agglomerations of streetcar suburbs in the United States. This area became popular with the affluent wanting to escape urban life, beginning after the Great Chicago Fire, and grew rapidly before and just after World War II with a growing Jewish population migrating out of various neighborhoods in Chicago. The major Jewish suburban communities include Evanston, Skokie, Glencoe, Northbrook, and Highland Park. Jews, however, were barred from Kenilworth and Lake Forest. The number of Jews in the north suburbs increased to 40% by the early 1960s. In the 1960s, most of the northern suburbs were almost entirely white. One informal 1967 poll suggested that of 2,000 real estate listings, only 38 (around 2%) were open to African-Americans. Origin and definition of term North Shore Line 1941 timetable cover The term North Shore began to come into use in the early 1880s, and by 1889, with the creation of the North Shore Improvement Association, the name was officially established. In 1890, Joseph Sears used the term several times in a brochure that was written to promote the newly-forming community of Kenilworth. It is believed to have come into widespread use following the establishment in 1891 of the Waukegan & North Shore Rapid Transit Company, which in 1916 following reorganization was renamed the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad (\\"CNS&M;\\"), popularly known as the North Shore Line. This railway ran along Lake Michigan's western shore between Chicago and Milwaukee. The Shore Line route of the CNS&M; until 1955 served, from south to north, the Illinois communities of Chicago, Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Highwood, Fort Sheridan, Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, North Chicago, Waukegan, Zion, and Winthrop Harbor as well as Kenosha, Racine, and Milwaukee (the \\"KRM\\") in Wisconsin. After 1924, the Skokie Valley line of the CNS&M; opened land further west to the North Shore. Meanwhile, in 1906, the Sanitary District of Chicago platted the \\"North Shore Channel\\" of the sanitary canal from the Chicago River, through Evanston and Wilmette to Lake Michigan. While the CNS&M; ran from Chicago all the way to Milwaukee, the term \\"North Shore\\" today typically refers only to the communities between Lake Bluff and Chicago. Michael Ebner's scholarly Creating Chicago's North Shore: A Suburban History, one of the most thorough studies of the area, covers eight suburbs along the lake: Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, Highland Park, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff. In their North Shore Chicago: Houses of the Lakefront Suburbs, 1890-1940, Cohen and Benjamin include not only those eight suburbs but also \\"the tiny city of Highwood\\" which is slightly inland, just north of Highland Park. Socioeconomics and culture Chicago, as seen from the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston. Today the North Shore remains one of the most affluent and highly educated areas in the United States. Seven of its communities are in the top quintile of U.S. household income, and five of those (Lake Forest, Glencoe, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Highland Park) are in the top 5 percent. The North Shore is also the home of the Ravinia Festival, a historic outdoor music theater in Highland Park, Illinois. The Ravinia Festival, originally conceived as a weekend destination on the CNS&M; line, is now a popular destination on the Metra Union Pacific North Line commuter rail, the North Shore Line's former competitor. It hosts many concerts through the year that attract over 600,000 people.Ravinia Festival Highwood became home of the annual Pumpkin Festival which saw thousands of people every year flock to the small town for a week of music, food, community, and the lighting of 32,000 Jack o' Lanterns. The town used to hold the world record for most carved and lit Jack o' Lanterns but lost the title to Keene, New Hampshire. The abandoned right-of-way of the North Shore Line still serves Ravinia as the Green Bay Trail, a popular rails-to-trails bicycle path that begins in Wilmette and runs north all the way to the Illinois Beach State Park in Zion. The Greater North Shore Subsequent to the more general use of the term North Shore for the above suburbs, and the term's association with those towns' desirable socioeconomic characteristics, it became common for businesses in numerous nearby inland Chicago suburbs in the Maine, New Trier, Niles, Northfield, and Norwood Townships, as well as in southern Lake County, Illinois, to name themselves \\"North Shore\\", and for real estate and other marketers to use the term for non-North Shore communities from time to time. The former North Shore magazine had special advertising editions not only for Evanston, Winnetka, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff, but also for Glenview, Northbrook, Barrington, Bannockburn, and Riverwoods.North Shore magazine.

Education Mostly the Central Suburban League public high schools serve the North Shore. The Central Suburban League is an IHSA- recognized high school extracurricular conference comprising 12 public schools located in the northern suburbs of Chicago. Comprising 12 relatively large high schools, it is among the larger high school conferences (by student population) in Illinois. The Central Suburban League high schools include: Deerfield High School (Deerfield, IL), Evanston Township High School (Evanston, IL), Glenbrook North High School (Northbrook, IL), Glenbrook South High School (Glenview, IL), Highland Park High School (Highland Park, IL), Maine South High School (Park Ridge, IL), Maine East High School (Park Ridge, IL), Maine West High School (Des Plaines, IL), New Trier High School (Winnetka, IL), Niles West High School (Skokie, IL), Niles North High School (Skokie, IL), and Vernon Hills High School (Vernon Hills, IL). Lake Forest High School, Libertyville High School, and Stevenson High School, are in the North Suburban Conference. The Lake Forest High School district serves Lake Forest and Lake Bluff, while the Stevenson High School district serves Lincolnshire and most of Buffalo Grove. Stevenson also takes in students from smaller parts of other North Shore suburbs such as Deerfield, Mettawa, Lake Forest, Riverwoods, Vernon Hills, as well as reaching into the far Northwest Suburbs such as Hawthorn Woods, Kildeer, Lake Zurich, Mundelein, and Long Grove. Wheeling High School serves most of Wheeling, Illinois which is in the Mid-Suburban League.

Toby, a tram engine with cowcatchers and sideplates, carries the North Western Railway running number seven and works on the same Ffarquhar Branch Line as Thomas the Tank Engine. Toby first appeared in the seventh book in The Railway Series, Toby the Tram Engine in 1952, and appeared in several subsequent books. The second book focused on Toby was the sixth of Christopher Awdry's books, Toby, Trucks and Trouble. Prototype and back-story Class J70 steam tram on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway, early 1950s. Toby is based on a J70 tram engine from the Great Eastern Railway (GER Class C53). His cowcatchers and sideplates allow him to run on roadside tramways, which other engines are not allowed to do for safety reasons. J70s were used for light duties, such as branch line work and dock shunting. Many J70s could be found working on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway in East Anglia only 28 miles (46 km) from Rev. W. Awdry's parish at Elsworth in Cambridgeshire in the same diocese. Rev. W. Awdry wrote about Toby the Tram Engine in 1952, shortly before he was transferred to Emneth parish. The Tramway ran from Wisbech, through Emneth ‚Äì the next station on the line ‚Äì then through Outwell and Upwell. This area and its line was well known to Rev. W. Awdry who often visited Ely nearby. The Tramway was primarily used for the transportation of fruit and other farm produce to the main line at Wisbech. The line closed to passengers in 1927, but freight services continued until lorries and road transport boomed in the 1950s. In 1952, the steam tram engines were replaced by diesel Drewry Shunters (the BR Class 04). Inspiration for Toby came from the Awdrys watching a J70 ‚Äì probably 68221, one of three J70s built in 1914 (as GER 127) ‚Äì at Great Yarmouth in 1951. Further inspiration was drawn soon after when the Rev. 'Teddy' Boston, then curate at Wisbech, arranged for Awdry to ride on the footplate of one of the last surviving steam tram engines on the Tramway. Fascinated by the unusual engines, Awdry sought a way to incorporate them in the stories. Research by Awdry's brother, George, revealed that tramway regulations required the fitting of cowcatchers and sideplates for railway locomotives running on tracks alongside roads, and the story \\"Thomas in Trouble\\" (published in 1952, the year steam trams were replaced) evolved to provide a reason for Toby being summoned to Sodor. The story includes a description of Toby's final journeys on the line: This was a common occurrence during the closing of real railway lines; demand decreased to an unprofitable amount, but services were often full for the last workings of steam. On Awdry's model railway, Toby was represented by a Y6, an 0-4-0 locomotive similar to but smaller than the J70 and better suited to the 4-wheel motor bogie available to power the model. In 1961, Awdry wrote an article for Railway Modeller magazine on the construction of this locomotive. Christopher Awdry has said that Toby is his favourite character, partly because he was there when his father received the inspiration to create him, but also because as a child he had travelled in the cab of two J70s. Rev. W, Awdry served as parish priest in two parishes in Cambridgeshire, the county associated with Toby the Tram Engine. First, he was Rector of Elsworth with Knapwell from 1946 to 1953, then he was Vicar of Emneth from 1953 until 1965 when he retired from full-time ministry and moved to Stroud, Gloucestershire. Toby in The Railway Series Toby is introduced in the 7th book in The Railway Series. The first story, \\"Toby and the Stout Gentleman\\", describes the closure of Toby's branch line due to the lack of passengers and freight. Shortly before the line was to close, a \\"stout gentleman\\" arrived on a holiday with his family; the children rode on Toby every day for a fortnight and the stout gentleman gave Toby's crew a present. The day after the Tramway closed, ironically after an overcrowded final journey by Toby and Henrietta, a letter arrived from the stout gentleman which was to give Toby a reprieve. In \\"Thomas in Trouble\\", Thomas encounters an officious policeman, who says that, when running from the quarry, along public roads, engines who have the right to go on public roads must be fitted with cowcatchers and sideplates for safety to prevent people and animals from getting killed if they should have the right to stray onto the line. The Fat Controller, urgently needing to rectify this, is discussing the fitting of these, when Thomas remarks that \\"everyone will laugh...they'll say I look like a tram\\". The Fat Controller (the \\"stout gentleman\\") remembered Toby immediately and arranged for him to come to Sodor. Toby arrives with his coach, Henrietta, and became a friend of Thomas after Toby rings his bell and frightens the policeman. In \\"Dirty Objects\\", James makes fun of Toby's \\"shabby\\" appearance. James later has an accident with tar wagons. Toby and Percy help to clear up the mess and Toby is rewarded with a new coat of paint. His chosen livery of chocolate brown with blue sideplates replicates that which he would have worn on the GER. Toby suffers from having small water tanks, meaning he is unsuitable for long distance work. In \\"Double Header\\" (in The Eight Famous Engines), Toby uses the Main Line to travel to the Works for servicing. He has stopped at a water-crane to refill his tanks, when he is urged on to the next station by a new Signalman who didn't understand Toby's condition. Toby tries to hurry to the next station, but uses up the water and runs out of steam, ending up marooned on the mainline far from the station. Toby is pushed by James to the station, where some boys misunderstand the situation and suggest that James was unable to pull the Express, and Toby was needed to double-head the train. Toby is also associated with the coach Victoria, who forms the \\"vintage train\\" with Henrietta that takes workers to and from the quarry. Toby in the television series Toby in CGI Toby first appeared towards the end of the first season of the TV show and is considered to be one of the central characters. Toby has his own song, of the same name, which is based upon his theme composed by Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell. This theme was originally going to be the show‚Äôs theme song before the more well-known intro was decided on. Toby was originally depicted as a wise, brave and kind old engine, often giving advice to younger engines like Thomas,Percy and Mavis. Due to his experience and wisdom Toby rarely ever had accidents or derailments, and almost never got into trouble with the Fat Controller. In recent seasons, Toby has been feeling more insecure with the world around him as he is an old engine, and is not on the same page as the younger engines, like Percy, who feel more rough and ready. Toby was dropped from the main cast in the 22nd season as part of the attempt to bring the Steam Team's gender balance to a near 50/50 split. However, he was not dropped entirely, being the focus of subsequent episodes in following series and appearing in the updated roll call. Compared to both Edward and Henry (who were also dropped), Toby has had more consistent supporting roles than both of them.

Later, after Diesel 10 overhears Thomas and Percy's conversation about how Mr. Conductor travels to Sodor, Toby manages to stall Diesel 10 ringing his bell. Diesel 10 tries to attack Toby with his claw, but instead fails and brings a shed down by himself as well as his cronies.'Full Cast and Crew for Thomas and the Magic Railroad' (2000) at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 18 June 2005. Colm Feore provided the voice of Toby in the film, portraying the character with old English dialect. Henrietta Henrietta is Toby's faithful coach, based on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway non-articulated GER four-wheeled coach. She worked with Toby on their old railway, and when that line closed Toby could not bear to leave her behind. The stationmaster had wanted to turn her into a henhouse, but The Fat Controller agreed that \\"that would never do.\\" The two are inseparable, and whenever they are apart they worry about each other: Henrietta carries passengers and is used to bring quarry workers to and from work. In \\"The Fat Controller's Engines\\" (The Eight Famous Engines), she is used as the Fat Controller's private coach when the locomotives take a trip to The Other Railway. Henrietta was the only named character not to be illustrated with a face in The Railway Series until book 41 of the series, Thomas and Victoria. In this book, Henrietta is depicted with a small rectangular face where a window on the end doors would be. It was the same colour as her cabin, like the other coaches. She even didn't have a visible face in the television series until the eighteenth season. Her face in this series is larger than in the Railway Series, and it completely replaces the door on one end, as well as the immediately adjoining window on both sides. The face is also whitish-gray as are those of the engines and much of the rolling stock, as opposed to the same brown as her paintwork as she appears in the book. Voice actors * Maggie Ollerenshaw (Season 18 onwards) * Yumi Nakatani (Japan (Season 1 only)) * Keiko Nemoto (Japan (Season 18 onwards)) Elsie Toby also has a baggage car named Elsie, mentioned in The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways and the 1979 Thomas the Tank Engine Annual. However, she has not yet appeared in any stories. According to the Rev. W. Awdry, she is based upon a Wisbech and Upwell Tramway luggage van and shares a shed with Henrietta. Heritage railways Replica Toby and Henrietta Toby replica on Avon Valley Railway T√≥bi, the new M 06-401 railcar on the streets of Szokolya village There are no surviving J70 trams; a replica, based at the East Anglian Railway Museum, is a diesel-hydraulic 0-4-0 shunter with a metal casing over it. When this diesel was converted a replica Henrietta was built from scratch. The underframe was taken from an old box van, but the body was a complete new build. Toby and Henrietta can be seen running on the Museum's Day out with Thomas events. A project to build a steam-powered replica of a GER Class G15 Wisbech and Upwell tram based on a Belgian Cockerill 0-4-0 tram engine has been underway for some time at the Nene Valley Railway.Y6 Tram replica, Nene Valley blog, June 2010 Named \\"Toby\\", work on the project stalled following the deaths of the tram's owners, but the project was sold in January 2011 with a view to recommencing work on the replica. A project to build a J70 replica to resemble a tram engine based on the 'Wisbech and Upwell Tram Railway's \\"Toby the Tram Engine\\" is under way at Mangapps Railway Museum near Burnham on Crouch in Essex. The engine is a Drewry ‚Äì Vulcan industrial diesel locomotive '11104'. Not based on the character, the Kir√°lyr√©t Forestry Railway built a diesel railcar in 2010. Because of its rather rectangular shape and the wooden sheathing very similar to that of Toby the Tram Engine the railcar is nicknamed Toby, or with a Hungarian spelling, T√≥bi.

Her latest book, Pakistan: Beyond the Crisis State, was published in April 2011 (by C Hurst, Columbia University Press and Oxford University Press). In 1994, Time magazine cited Dr. Lodhi as one of 100 global pacesetters and leaders, who would define the 21st century and was the only person from Pakistan on that list.  High Commissioner to the United Kingdom  On 26 July 2003, Lodhi was appointed as the Pakistan's envoy to the Court of St James's, London by General Musharraf who sized power in the 1999 coup d'√©tat. She served for 5-year, returning to Pakistan in 2008. Ambassador to the United Nations The office of Pakistan's mission to the UN located on the East 65th Street. According to the Daily Times Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after extensive consultations with his close aide Sartaj Aziz, decided to appoint Lodhi in the UN. She succeeded Masood Khan in February 2015. Lodhi made her debut address at the United Nations on 6 February 2015 where she called for 'addressing the underlying factors responsible for terrorism so as to formulate an effective and comprehensive response'.Pakistan tells UN to address root causes for eliminating terrorism Addressing the Catalytic Partnerships for Gender Equality in Education event in United Nations on 14 March 2015, Lodhi said Pakistan has launched innovative schemes and pilot projects for girls' education. Lodhi also said that the education voucher scheme launched in Punjab, as well as conditional grants that were given in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) have helped in promoting education in Pakistan. She also hosted a reception in honor of ambassadors and other prominent personalities at her residence.Maleeha hosts reception in honour of envoys, celebrities Lodhi while addressing the United Nations Security Council debate on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan she said that \\"The new Afghan government has called for dialogue to resolve differences through political means. There are encouraging indications that the Taliban may be willing to negotiate with the National Unity Government,\\" Lodhi urged that \\"The Taliban will no doubt test the mettle of the Afghan National Security Force. It will need to demonstrate to them that a military solution is not possible,\\". After assuming charge as the President of executive board of UNICEF, Lodhi in an Op-Ed for CNN argued that 'We must never accept a world in which humanitarian aid workers can be attacked and killed with impunity.' Under her leadership UNICEF has reaffirmed commitment to giving every child a fair chance in life. On 9 January 2016, she ended her year long tenure as UNICEF President. Anthony Lake thanked Lodhi for her contribution to achieving UNICEF's goals in 2015. She oversaw adoption of 16 decisions for several UNICEF programmes and endeavours including an increase in the Emergency Programme Fund ceiling. On 10 March 2016, Lodhi opposed adding new permanent members to the United Nations Security Council with or without a veto, adding that Pakistan supports expansion of the Security Council only in the non-permanent category in order to make the Council more democratic, accountable, effective and transparent. On 29 August 2015, Lodhi rang the opening bell at the NASDAQ in New York to signal the ceremonial start of trading, saying Pakistan's economy is on the upswing as it pursues liberal economic and investor-friendly policies. This was the first time the stock exchange has opened its doors to an ambassador from Pakistan to ring the opening bell to mark its Independence Day. On 24 April 2016, Lodhi invited Leonardo DiCaprio to Pakistan after a meeting with him at the UN. On 30 May 2016, talking to the students at the Harvard Kennedy School, Lodhi claimed that Pakistan's massive military operation aimed at rooting out terrorism is in its final phase but the menace is not going to just go away unless there is peace on the other side of the border in strife-torn Afghanistan. On 6 January 2017, Lodhi provided a dossier on captured Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav and evidence of attempted violation of maritime boundary by an Indian submarine to Ant√≥nio Guterres. On 7th Febuaray 2017, Lodhi opposed the G4 nations submission on UN security reform saying that it is \\"inconceivable\\" to establish any institution that does not value \\"principles of representation and accountability\\" through periodic elections. In response to the United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital, Lodhi said Pakistan \\"remained a steadfast supporter of the Palestinians despite the kind of threats we have received in recent days from the United States.\\" On 30 Sep 2019, she was replaced by Munir Akram, on orders of Prime Minister Imran Khan, as Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations.  Public image = Global image  According to The Daily Telegraph, \\"Lodhi confounds every preconception about Pakistani women. She is sharp, funny, strong willed, articulate and a feminist who hates cooking\\". According to the New York Times, \\"Lodhi presents herself as the paradigm of a modern self-made South Asian woman comes in part from her middle-class family heritage. Unlike Benazir Bhutto, whose roots are in the feudal landed gentry, Ms. Lodhi was the daughter of an oil executive and a journalist. She was sent to a convent run by nuns in Rawalpindi for schooling because that was the best education available, and a tolerant atmosphere prevailed. She learned to read the Koran as a child, but hers was a \\"spiritual household\\", she said, rather than a strictly religious one.\\"  Relationship with Robin Raphel  Lodhi and Robin Raphel often held informal meetings at the Rtiz lobby. On 30 November, an exclusive report by The Wall Street Journal on Robin Raphel, a former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, who was a subject of a federal counterintelligence investigation, showcased close relationship between Lodhi and Raphel. According to report, Raphel and Lodhi turned to each other, on and off, for information and in 2014, the FBI became suspicious of their relationship leading to unsuccessful counterintelligence investigation. The report suggested that Lodhi and Raphel often met at The Ritz-Carlton, Washington, D.C. in the 1990s and worked together for the passage of an act by Senator Hank Brown easing sanctions on Pakistan. The report quoted U.S officials as seeing Lodhi as an \\"influencer\\" and saw her a trusted conduit for relaying messages to Pakistan's senior military leadership in Rawalpindi.  Relationship with Pakistan Army  In February 2016, Pakistan Today reported that Hillary Clinton email's revealed that Lodhi apparently acted as an informal messenger between the Obama Administration and then army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. In one of the emails by Vali Nasr to Clinton, Nasr wrote that \\"I got a call from Maleeha Lodhi, who is in London. She gave a message from Kayani\\", The readout of Kayani's message through Maleeha ‚Äì running into two paragraphs was classified.Maleeha Lodhi acted as secret messenger for former COAS Controversies  Lodhi was accused of religious bigotry after she deleted a tweet congratulating Mahershala Ali for his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win in 2017. Lodhi had initially congratulated Ali on being the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar but subsequently deleted it after other Twitter users \\"pointed out\\" that he is an [Ahmadiyya]- a member of an Islamic sect often persecuted in the Muslim world and Pakistan in particular. Lodhi, while responding to Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj's speech branding Pakistan an \\"exporter of terrorism\\", in the midst of her 'right to reply', showed a photo of a woman whose face was peppered with wounds and said, \\"This is the face of Indian democracy,\\" when in actuality, the image depicted a Gazan Arab minor who had sustained bodily cephalic injury in a purported acid attack.

Its western end is at I-295 and Route 29 just south of Trenton, New Jersey, in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, while its eastern end is at the Garden State Parkway, Route 34 and Route 138 in Wall Township, Monmouth County. I-195 is in length. The route is mostly a four-lane highway that runs through wooded areas in Central Jersey. It has an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) in Robbinsville Township and serves as a main access road to the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park (which is off the CR 537 exit in Jackson Township) and the Jersey Shore. I-195 is occasionally referred to as the Central Jersey Expressway. On April 6, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. 4263 naming Interstate 195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway, in honor of the late James J. Howard. The current I-195 was initially planned as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it became two proposed freeways Route 37 and Route 38 that were to cross the central part of the state. A compromise was reached for a single freeway between Trenton and Belmar which would get Interstate Highway funding as I-195. It was built in several stages during the 1970s and 1980s. There once existed a plan to extend the I-195 designation west to the interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, but it was decided to extend the I-295 designation west and south, along existing I-95 instead. Route description I-195's western terminus is at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I-295 in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, located southeast of the city of Trenton. From this end, the freeway continues north into Trenton as Route 29. I-195 serves as the southern continuation of Route 29, continuing east from I-295 as a six-lane expressway, passing between suburban neighborhoods to the north and the Crosswicks Creek to the south. After the exit for US 206, the highway narrows to four lanes and turns northeast as it interchanges with CR 524 and CR 620. Following this, I-195 passes near more neighborhoods and runs to the northwest of Gropp Lake before turning more to the east. The route has a cloverleaf interchange with Yardville-Hamilton Square Road before passing near business parks and reaching a cloverleaf junction with US 130. After US 130, the road enters Robbinsville Township as the settings start to become more rural, with a few areas of suburban development. In Robbinsville Township, there is a ramp that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). Shortly after passing over the New Jersey Turnpike, I-195 reaches the exit for CR 526. The highway runs to the north of Allentown before briefly forming the border between Robbinsville Township to the north and Upper Freehold Township, Monmouth County to the south as it reaches the interchange with CR 524/CR 539. I-195 eastbound past the CR 43 interchange in Upper Freehold TownshipUpon passing under CR 524/CR 539, I-195 fully enters Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County and continues east through a mix of woodland and farmland. The next interchange the highway reaches is with CR 43. Past this exit, the highway passes through more rural areas and crosses into Millstone Township. In this area, I-195 turns to the southeast and enters more forested areas as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with CR 537. This exit off I-195 provides access to the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park and the Jackson Premium Outlets. Due to the presence of Six Flags, this exit off I-195 can become busy during the summer months since it provides access to the park from both the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, which lies just east of I-195's eastern terminus. Upon crossing CR 537, the highway enters Jackson Township in Ocean County and continues east through heavy woods. The road comes to an exit with CR 527, where there is a park and ride lot for motorists. The median of I-195 widens past the CR 527 junction before narrowing as it comes to the CR 638 interchange. The road runs through more woodland, with nearby residential development increasing. After crossing the North Branch Metedeconk River, I-195 continues into Howell Township, Monmouth County and turns northeast, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9. At this point, the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods, passing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line. After crossing the Manasquan River, the expressway interchanges with CR 547, which provides access to CR 524 and CR 549. Shortly after CR 547, I-195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park. The eastern end of I-195 is located at Exit 35, its junction with Route 34 that has access to the southbound Garden State Parkway from the eastbound direction. At the exit for Route 34, I-195 ends and Route 138 begins, but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138, marking the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as Exit 36. Past this interchange, Route 138 continues east to Belmar on the Jersey Shore as an arterial boulevard, making connections with Route 18 and Route 35. History alt=A four lane freeway at an interchange in a wooded area with two green signs over the road. The left one reads Interstate 195 west Trenton and the right one reads exit 21 County Route 527 County Route 526 Jackson Siloam upper right arrow What would become I-195 was first proposed in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway that was to be operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority, the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time. In 1965, this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System. The western portion would become a part of the Route 37 freeway that was to run from Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would become a part of the Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Belmar. The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix. By 1967, plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled, leaving Route 37 as the only planned east-west freeway through central New Jersey. The routing of this freeway, which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway, was changed to run from the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition, officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway, with funds to be diverted from the canceled I-278 in Union County. The proposed freeway would cost $60 million. Interchange 21 was once the eastern terminus of I-195, as this alt=A topographic map showing a freeway coming in from the left and ending abruptly at a surface road running top to bottom. The freeway continues to the right as a dotted line By 1970, construction took place on the route between CR 539 near Allentown and CR 527 in Jackson Township. The portion of I-195 between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 527 was opened by 1973 and construction on the section between White Horse and the New Jersey Turnpike began. In 1979, I-195 was completed east to Squankum. By 1983, the length of I-195 was completed. When it was planned, I-195 did not intersect I-95 at all; it instead connected to I-295 at its west end. When I-95 was re-routed to the New Jersey Turnpike after the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway, I-195 was connected to I-95. Previously, I-95 abruptly ended at I-295 and US 1 in Lawrence Township and motorists had to take I-295 southbound to I-195 east in order to access I-95/New Jersey Turnpike. This is no longer necessary as a result of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project which opened to traffic on September 22, 2018 completing the full length of I-95 from Miami, Florida to Houlton, Maine. On April 6, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. 4263 naming I-195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway, in honor of the late James J. Howard, a U.S. Representative from New Jersey who advocated improving the highways of the United States. In the late 1990s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation considered the possibility of widening I-195 to six lanes between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 537 in order to accommodate traffic going to Six Flags Great Adventure. The interchange with CR 537 was improved in 1997 by adding separate ramps to westbound and eastbound CR 537 from I-195 and by making the westbound ramp two lanes for Six Flags traffic. View west along I-195 in Hamilton I-195, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar powered emergency call boxes every . With the advent of cell phones, the call boxes saw limited use. To save on maintenance costs, the NJDOT removed the call boxes in 2005. On April 30, 2010, NJDOT started a project to repave the expressway both eastbound and westbound from just east of the Turnpike overpasses near Exit 7 in Robbinsville Township to Exit 11 in Upper Freehold Township. This was completed in late autumn of 2010. From July 2009 until November 2014, the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) was widened with the construction of new outer roadways (\\"truck lanes\\") that extended the \\"dual-dual\\" roadways south to Interchange 6 in Mansfield Township from its former end at Interchange 8A in Monroe Township. As part of this project, the overpasses carrying I-195 over the Turnpike were reconstructed, the Interchange 7A toll gate was widened, and all the ramps connecting directly to the mainline of the Turnpike were rebuilt which included building a new high-speed ramp over I-195 to enter the northbound lanes of the Turnpike.Gov. Christie, NJDOT Commissioner FoxPraise $2.3 Billion NJ Turnpike Infrastructure Investment Project , New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Accessed November 3, 2014. \\"The Widening Program created a three-lane Outer Roadway in each direction over the 25 miles between Interchange 6 in Mansfield Township, Burlington County, and Interchange 8A in Monroe Township, Middlesex County.\\" View east along I-195 from its western terminus at I-295 For about a decade, there was a plan to extend the designation of I-195 to the west in concurrence with the rerouting of I-95 planned as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project. Beginning in 2005, plans were made to extend I-195 west from its present-day western terminus along I-295 and I-95, continuing counterclockwise to the north, west and south around Trenton to the new interchange. I-295 would have been truncated to the current interchange with I-195. Officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania had agreed to submit the I-195 request to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), as no route designation is official until approved by them. Had it been approved, approximately would have been added to I-195. Interchange renumbering would have also taken place in concert with the future I-195 designation in Pennsylvania and both the planned and current I-195 designation in New Jersey. This proposal had received conditional approval from AASHTO. However, on May 20, 2015, the original plan of extending I-295 west and south into Pennsylvania to the new interchange was approved instead, leaving the western terminus of I-195 at its current location. In 2018, the exit numbers at the interchanges for I-295 (Exits 60A-B) and U.S. Route 206 (Exits 1A-B) were renumbered to Exits 1 A-B and Exits 1 C-D, respectively. This change was done as part of the I-95/I-295 redesignation project to match the mile markers along I-195. Future The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has studied proposals to expand I-195 from Exit 16 near Six Flags to the New Jersey Turnpike from 4 to 6 total lanes, which would eliminate the grass median in the process.

As of 2010 over 100,000 had been sold. Three distinct models have been marketed, the third (Mk3) sold from July 2015. First released in 1995, it was the first fully suspended folding bike. The ride is regarded by some as more sporty than the Brompton, thanks in part to a stiff single-piece aluminium frame with road bike rider geometry and no hinge. Some prefer its stiff suspended ride and rapid acceleration to that of a full-sized bike.

It had a high price tag, usually over US$1,000. Several specifications were available, most with d√©railleur gears but including one model with a rubber belt drive. All had only one front chainring, and a range of gearing options on the rear wheel from 6 to 14 gears. There was a short period in 1996-1997 when a stock of blue frames entered the USA and were built up and sold with inferior 6 speed components, branded as 'Jeep Renegade'.Source: author, who bought one in 1997 for $600 online. The seller was soon stopped. http://www.bicyclebluebook.com/searchlistingdetail.aspx?id=63661 Mark 1 Birdy folding bike from 2000, with 7 speed d√©railleur The Birdy's dimensions are small enough to take into offices, on buses, and to pack for travelling. It is the second smallest of the quality folding bikes (behind the Brompton), and is similar in size to the Mezzo performance folder: Width: Height: Length: The front suspension is unique among bikes currently on the market. The leading arm design provides anti-dive suspension, unlike trailing arm designs. The hinged rear swingarm is suspended by a urethane bush, that can also be replaced with a gas-filled unit. The bike has always offered standard rear dropout spacing, which allows a wide range of gearing options and disc brakes. Standard options currently include: 8-speed hub gear, 8-speed d√©railleur, 24-speed SRAM Dual Drive hybrid gearing system, Rohloff Speedhub 14-speed hub gear. The more expensive models are now fitted with disc brakes. Wheels are 18\\" but conversions can easily be made to the more readily available 16\\" size used by Brompton. For a long time there were no decent 18\\" tyres. Some have even fitted 20-inch wheels to the bike (a 10th anniversary limited edition had 20\\" wheels as standard ). For folding, the rear suspension tucks under the frame, the front suspension is unclipped and hinges back under the frame, and the seat post is collapsed. Lastly the handlebars hinge downward.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owLv-_CPNJI The front wheel can be left unfolded if the package is to be wheeled, for example when boarding public transport. Folding is relatively more complicated than for a Brompton and takes slightly longer.Folding a Mark 1 Birdy bike Available accessories are mudguards, front and rear folding racks, bags, lighting sets and some upmarket extra components sold in Singapore and Hong Kong, like gas suspension units. Two optional rear racks are available, the SL Carrier and the Expedition Carrier.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ivOJtldKu0 The former mounts directly to the swingarm, and allows only the use of a rack-top bag. The latter is a folding 16mm tubular rack mounted on pivots on both the main frame and the swingarm, which allows use of small panniers (e.g. Ortlieb Front Roller) when mudguards (fenders) are fitted. The mounting pivots for this rack have only been fitted to frames since 2003. Both racks are available with rollers which allows the Birdy to roll when folded. A slightly lighter Mark 2 monocoque frame, with greater support for the seatpost (top picture), was introduced in 2006 along with new component choices. The Mark 1 continues to be used with a slightly updated frame on some models, notably the World Comfort (7 speed Nexus, . Mark 1 frames are available in Asia, badged as Rhine. The standard Mark 2 weighed (2013). Some riders have reduced the Birdy's weight to 8 kg using racing components, but this was only on the Mark 1 frames. Stock bikes ranged from (for the Birdy Speed with Tune and Shimano Ultegra road components) to over , depending on the setup. The heavier bikes tend to have 3x8 gearing systems, involving an internally geared rear hub and an external derailleur. The Birdy Race () was introduced in 2013 and has dropped handlebars, and Shimano 20-speed gears with two front chainrings. A smaller version of the Birdy, the Frog, was introduced in the 2000s, then withdrawn due to poor sales, and was back on the market again from 2010. A mark 3 design was released in July 2015. The frame looks the same as a Mk2, but the fold is smaller, the bike is slightly lighter, components have again been strengthened, and the front fork redesigned. The confusing number of models has been reduced to four. Average price Equipment set up differs greatly from country to country. In the US, entry-level bikes cost approximately $1,500 and are equipped with low-mid range Shimano Alivio components.http://www.birdybike.com The Birdy monocoque frameset costs approximately US$1,000 without parts. Prices for the Mk 2 rose to the electric model with a 250watt motor in the rear wheel (¬£3258/US$5068, 2013) In the UK, the entry-level model (World Sport) costs ¬£939 (as of 2013) to permit purchase under cycle-to-work schemes. High-end titanium models (rare outside Japan and Australia) can cost over US$4,500. Japan is the biggest market for these bikes and offers a wide array of cost-effective choices. In Japan, the bike is distributed as the Bianchi Fretta (OEM) and BD-1. The cheapest model in Australia is A$1,400 in 2015. The Birdy is distributed in Europe by Riese und M√ºller, in Japan by Pacific Cycles Japan, in North America through dealers B-Fold. and in Australia by St.Kilda Cycles (until 2013, then again from 2015). Some distributors make custom modifications to the bicycle including better suspension dampers and wheels.e.g. Japanese AddOns Uses and advantages With its wide range of gearing options, stiff frame and basic suspension, the Birdy is suitable not only for commuting but also for longer distance touring. The combination of smooth but stiff ride, fold, and quirky looks have created a fetish for the Birdy in Japan. It also has a large following in the UK, Europe, the US, and Australia. The Birdy's folded size is similar to the 20-inch Dahon folders: larger than a Brompton, but significantly smaller than a Bike Friday (including the Tikit). Advantages:https://simonbatterbury.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/brompton-vs-birdy- the-folding-bike-wars *It folds quickly into a small package. Thus, it can be taken into stores, onto trains, and into the office, yet can also be used for cross-country touring or fast group rides. It is much easier to fit in a suitcase than comparable Bike Friday or Airnimal models, but less easy to pack than a Brompton. The only other hinge-free performance bicycle that is small enough to serve as a multi-mode commuter or that fits into an airline legal suitcase with minimal disassembly is the (unsuspended) Mezzo folding bike. *A Birdy can fit into a standard airline-legal 29-inch suitcase, but this requires the pedals, wheels, and rear rack to be removed. Some Birdy owners have had difficulty fitting both the bike and the rear rack into a standard suitcase, and recommend the larger 31-inch format. When fitted with thin racing tires and removable pedals, the bike can fit in a suitcase with less disassembly. With a larger case (designed specifically for the Birdy), no disassembly is required. A standard slipcase must be used on some trains and buses. *The suspension allows for a smooth ride on small wheels. The anti-dive suspension has minimal impact on pedalling efficiency due to its stiffness, while improving rolling resistance on rough surfaces. The suspension can be adjusted using different elastomers (small pieces of rubber that serve as suspension, but gas filled alternatives are available). *The Birdy has no frame hinge, with both the front and the back points of contact serving as latches and shock absorbers. Thus, the downward force of the rider holds the bike together in such a way that the latches cannot fail while providing shock absorption. *The bike has a sportier ride than the Brompton and has a wide range of gears.http://www.birdybike.com/?Birdy_in_actionhttps://simonbatterbury.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/brompton- vs-birdy-the-folding-bike-wars/ In sum it is a versatile bike, offering high performance, and sturdiness and luggage capacity for loaded long-distance touring using a variety of racks and panniers supplied by R&M; and other manufacturers. Reviews, for example those by the reputable alternative bike magazine AtoB, point to the great speed and comfort of the Mark 2, but the folding is not always quick if you miss a step, and the tyres available for 18\\" rims were limited for some years.http://www.atob.org.uk/folding- bikes/birdy-folding-bike-2006/ Tire selection is now adequate, and Kevlar- beaded tires, which can be folded for carriage in panniers, are available including the Schwalbe Marathon Racer. Disadvantages The main criticisms are: *The Birdy is expensive, with some models costing as much as custom made bikes. Nonetheless, secondhand Birdys can be bought on eBay or from specialist listing like AtoB for as little as US$500 for a Mark 1 model, and more commonly up to $700. *The 100% aluminium components used to get stress fractures in the early years, particularly when ridden by heavier riders or very energetically. New models have much stronger components. *The Birdy uses 18 inch (355mm ETRTO) wheels. This allows for a compact folded size but makes finding replacement wheels, tubes and tires more difficult. *Gears and brake components are standard. But the availability of some spare parts for the Birdy is rare, even in places in which sell folding bicycles, due to their unique design. For example: The Birdy uses a unique rear rack, a \\"spoon\\" clip to hold the rear in place, and unique front suspension bearings. Mudguards, however, can be made from any plastic equivalent and are a cheaper option than the Birdy models. Criticisms noticed by some riders: *Component selection on the Mk 2 sometimes seemed illogical, with lower level Capreo components on the top-of-the-line monocoque frame, and higher quality SRAM X7 components on the less expensive model. However, the Capreo groupset was specifically designed for small-wheel bicycles as its smallest 9-tooth sprocket compensates for the small wheel size. *The unique front folding mechanism - while popular and distinctive - is long, weaker, and more flexible than a standard design; the tolerance of linkages amplifies the flex, causing the leading arms to wander up to the Mk2 design (now much strengthened); thus an old Birdy may be unstable at speed. Bushes on the front suspension can be replaced. *The Birdy, like most folders, has a long seatpost and stem. Thousands of km of use can damage the headset or weaken the stem mount - old models could experience cracking after about ten years. The longer handlebar stem limits the extent to which the rider can pull on the handlebars, but a stronger adjustable version was introduced in the early 2000s that is more sturdy, and a further improvement in 2015. The larger head tube on the Moulton gives it better hill climbing and sprinting abilities. However, with proper cycling shoes, Birdy riders can be found in non-UCI racing events and in pacelines of fast group rides. *The back folding mechanism, which folds beneath the frame, doesn't retain chain tension when folded if d√©railleur gears are fitted (unlike the Brompton for example). Again, this has been solved on the Mk 3.

He was born Edwin Lee Conarty in Flagler, Colorado, but fought out of San Diego, California. In 2003, Murphy, who was a southpaw, made the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. Early life Edward Lee Conarty (https://web.archive.org/web/20100514180318/http://www.usslexingtoncv16.org/members/roster1940s.htm) was born in Flagler, Colorado, on July 22, 1922, to Della Mae (Curtis) and John Patrick Conarty. He joined the Navy at the age of 18 in Salt Lake City, Utah, on March 18, 1941, and was assigned aboard the U.S.S. Lexington (https://web.archive.org/web/20100514180318/http://www.usslexingtoncv16.org/members/roster1940s.htm). After the U.S.S. Lexington went down in the Battle of Coral Sea on May 8, 1942, Conarty was among the many Lexington survivors that were assigned to the U.S.S. Alabama (BB-60) to put it into commission. Conarty was known for his boxing skill and was a member of both the Lexington and Alabama boxing teams. Nicknamed \\"Jack\\" Conarty during his service aboard the \\"Mighty A,\\" he was known as an exciting boxer who \\"packed a blockbuster in his left (southpaw) and would take anything his opponent could hand out just long enough to unload one of his bombs.\\" It is said that he never lost a single boxing match in his entire service aboard BB-60. Pro career Under the new professional name Irish Bob Murphy, he unsuccessfully challenged Joey Maxim for the light heavyweight championship on August 22, 1951. Although Murphy entered the ring as the favorite, Maxim clearly outboxed him and won a unanimous 15-round decision. Murphy's biggest win came on June 27, 1951 against former middleweight champion Jake LaMotta, who had moved up to the light heavyweight division after losing his crown to Sugar Ray Robinson. LaMotta appeared poorly prepared for the bout, weighing a career-high 175¬Ω lbs. The match stopped when LaMotta could not answer the bell for the eighth round. Murphy and LaMotta fought a rematch on June 11, 1952, and LaMotta won the decision. Murphy retired in 1954 with a 65-11-1 record and 57 knockout wins. Death Murphy was killed in a road accident in Boston, when he crashed his motorcycle and broke his neck on August 1, 1961.

The ship's keel was laid down in October 1934, launched in July 1937, and readied for service with the Italian fleet by August 1940. She was named after the Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto during World War I, and she had three sister ships: , , and , though only Littorio and Roma were completed during the war. She was armed with a main battery of nine guns in three triple turrets, and could steam at a speed of . Vittorio Veneto saw extensive service during the war. Early in the war, she participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. While damaged by torpedoes several times, including in the engagement off Cape Matapan and by the British submarine in December 1941, the ship escaped undamaged during the British raid on Taranto in November 1940. She spent 1941 and early 1942 attempting to attack British convoys to Malta, but crippling fuel shortages in the Italian fleet curtailed activity thereafter. Vittorio Veneto was among the Italian ships that were surrendered to the Allies in September 1943 after Italy withdrew from the war, and she spent the following three years under British control in Egypt. After the war, she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and subsequently broken up for scrap. Description Line-drawing of the Littorio class Vittorio Veneto was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She was designed with a standard displacement of , a violation of the restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty; at full combat loading, she displaced . The ship was powered by four Belluzo geared steam turbines rated at . Steam was provided by eight oil-fired Yarrow boilers. The engines provided a top speed of and a range of at . Vittorio Veneto had a crew of 1,830 to 1,950 over the course of her career.Garzke and Dulin, p. 435Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 289 Vittorio Venetos main armament consisted of nine 50-caliber Model 1934 guns in three triple turrets; two turrets were placed forward in a superfiring arrangement and the third was located aft. Her secondary anti- surface armament consisted of twelve /55 Model 1934/35 guns in four triple turrets placed at the corners of her superstructure. These were supplemented by four /40 Model 1891/92 guns in single mounts; these guns were old weapons and were primarily intended to fire star shells. Vittorio Veneto was equipped with an anti-aircraft battery that comprised twelve /53 Model 1939 guns in single mounts, twenty /54 guns in eight twin and four single mounts, and sixteen /65 guns in eight twin mounts.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 289-290 EC 3 ter Gufo radar, which could detect surface targets at a range of and aircraft at , was installed in July 1943.Bagnasco & De Toro, pp. 100-102 The ship was protected by a main armored belt that was with a second layer of steel that was thick. The main deck was thick in the central area of the ship and reduced to in less critical areas. The main battery turrets were thick and the lower turret structure was housed in barbettes that were also 350 mm thick. The secondary turrets had 280 mm thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides. Vittorio Veneto was fitted with a catapult on her stern and equipped with three IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance float planes or Reggiane Re.2000 fighters.Bagnasco & de Toro, p. 48 Service history=Construction Vittorio Veneto was ordered under the 1934 construction program, and was named for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, a decisive Italian victory over the Austro- Hungarian Empire in October-November 1918 during World War I.Whitley, p. 171 Her keel was laid on 28 October 1934 at Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Trieste, the same day as her sister ship . Vittorio Veneto was launched on 25 July 1937, and major construction was completed by October 1939. The fitting- out process was greatly delayed due to repeated changes to the design and shortages of heavy armor plate. Before she could begin sea trials, Vittorio Veneto was moved to Venice on 4 October to have her bottom cleaned of the fouling that had accumulated during the long fitting-out period, since the Venice Arsenal had the only drydock in Italy long enough to accommodate a ship the size of the Littorio class.Bagnasco & De Toro, pp. 118-119 On 17 October, with the cleaning completed, the dockyard personnel flooded the drydock to conduct stability tests. The new battleship moved to Trieste on 19 October, and her trials began on 23 October. The trials, which also included tests for the ship's weaponry, lasted until March 1940, after which some additional fitting-out work was completed.Bagnasco & De Toro, pp. 119-120 She was delivered on 28 April, though she was not yet complete. On 1 May, Vittorio Veneto was sent to La Spezia for final fitting-out work, escorted by the destroyers and . On 6 May, she was loaded with shells for her main battery; the loading work for the main and secondary guns lasted until 20 May. Later that day, she was transferred to Taranto, escorted by the destroyers and , where she joined the 9th Division of the Italian fleet. The following month, Italy joined the war against Britain and France, though it wasn't until 2 August that Vittorio Veneto and Littorio were formally declared operational.Whitley, pp. 169, 172Bagnaso & De Toto, p. 123 World War II Vittorio Veneto and Littorio on trials On 31 August - 2 September 1940, Vittorio Veneto sortied as part of an Italian force of five battleships, ten cruisers, and thirty-four destroyers to intercept British naval forces taking part in Operation Hats and Convoy MB.3, but contact was not made with either group due to poor aerial reconnaissance and no action occurred.Whitley, p. 172Bagnasco & de Toro, pp. 167-169Rohwer, p. 38 In addition, British aerial reconnaissance detected the oncoming Italian fleet and was able to escape. On 6 September, the fleet sortied again to attack a British force that had been reported leaving Gibraltar, but the British ships instead steamed south into the Atlantic.Garzke & Dulin, p. 382 A similar outcome resulted from the movement against British Operation \\"MB.5\\" on 29 September - 1 October; Vittorio Veneto, four other battleships, eleven cruisers, and twenty-three destroyers had attempted to intercept the convoy carrying troops to Malta.Bagnasco & de Toro, pp. 170-172 In this operation, the Italian Regia Aeronautica (Royal Air Force) did locate the convoy, but the British were able to evade the Italian fleet.Rohwer, p. 43 On the night of 10-11 November, the British Mediterranean Fleet launched an air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. The Italian base was defended by twenty-one 90 mm anti-aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37 mm and 20 mm guns, along with twenty-seven barrage balloons. The defenders did not possess radar, however, and so were caught by surprise when the Swordfish arrived. The first wave struck at 20:35, followed by the second about an hour later.Garzke & Dulin, p. 383 Vittorio Veneto was undamaged in the attack, but three other battleships were hit, two of which were severely damaged.Rohwer, p. 47 The morning after the Taranto raid, Vittorio Veneto led the Italian fleet to Naples. There, she took over the role of fleet flagship, under the command of Admiral Inigo Campioni. =Battle of Cape Spartivento= On 17 November, Vittorio Veneto and --the only operational Italian battleships--participated in an attempt to intercept the British Operation White convoy to Malta, though the forces made no contact.De La Sierra, p. 148 On 26 November, the Italian fleet made another attempt to attack a British convoy, Operation Collar, which resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento (known as the Battle of Cape Teulada to the Italians). Vittorio Veneto, Giulio Cesare, six cruisers, and fourteen destroyers attempted to catch a convoy steaming to Malta. The British escort included the aircraft carrier , the battleship , and the battlecruiser ; Italian aerial reconnaissance detected the escorts but exaggerated their strength and Campioni, under orders to not risk his two operational battleships against equal or stronger opponents, broke off the engagement shortly after it began. Vittorio Veneto briefly engaged several British cruisers at the extreme range 27,000 metres (17 miles). Vittorio Veneto fired 19 rounds in seven salvoes from long range and that was enough for the now outgunned British cruisers, which turned back at the fourth salvo.and slightly damaged the light cruiser Manchester.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 383-384Rohwer, p. 50 During the engagement, Ark Royal launched torpedo bombers against Vittorio Veneto, but the latter successfully evaded the torpedoes. Repeated British air attacks on Naples, one of which damaged the cruiser , prompted the high command to move Vittorio Veneto and the rest of the major warships of the fleet to Sardinia on 14 December. They were returned to Naples six days later, however, after the high command concluded that removing the fleet to Sardinia would allow British convoys from Alexandria to reach Malta with relative ease.Garzke & Dulin, p. 384 On the night of 8-9 January 1941, the British launched an air raid with Vickers Wellington bombers on the Italian fleet in Naples, but the aircraft again failed to hit Vittorio Veneto; Giulio Cesare was slightly damaged by several near misses. Both ships were moved to La Spezia the next day, with Vittorio Veneto providing cover for Giulio Cesare. Vittorio Veneto was now the only operational battleship in the fleet.Rohwer, p. 55 Giulio Cesare was back in service by early February, as was . The three battleships, along with eight destroyers, attempted to intercept Force H on 8 February, which was en route to bombard Genoa. The two forces did not encounter each other, and the Italian fleet returned to La Spezia. =Battle of Cape Matapan= Vittorio Veneto firing upon Allied cruisers during the daytime phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan near the Island of Gavdos Vittorio Veneto returned to Naples on 22 March, and four days later led an attempt to attack British shipping off Greece, in company with eight cruisers and nine destroyers. The fleet would be supported by the Regia Aeronautica and the German Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps). This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan; the engagement began when the Italian 3rd Division-- comprising the two heavy cruisers and and commanded by Vice Admiral Luigi Sansonetti--encountered the British 15th Cruiser Squadron. Iachino attempted to maneuver Vittorio Veneto to the east of the British cruisers while they were distracted with Sansonetti's cruisers, but spotted the battleship before she could close the trap. Vittorio Veneto immediately opened fire and quickly found the range, but only inflicted splinter damage on Orion, which fled to the south, back toward the main British fleet. Misfires in Vittorio Venetos forward-most turret forced her to cease firing temporarily. The Italian gunners quickly returned the guns to action, however, and resumed their bombardment of the British cruisers. Poor visibility and smokescreens hampered the accuracy of Vittorio Venetos gunners and they scored no hits, though they straddled the cruisers several times. In the course of this phase of the battle, she had fired 92 rounds from her main battery.O'Hara, pp. 86-90 Vittorio Veneto withdraws from Cape Matapan after being torpedoed by RN aircraft. During this period of the battle, torpedo bombers from the carrier arrived on the scene, and their attack forced Vittorio Veneto to break off the engagement with the British cruisers to take evasive action. She evaded the torpedoes, but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea, which prompted him to end the operation and return to port. The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet in an attempt to slow down Vittorio Veneto, including land-based Blenheim bombers from Greece and Crete. Later in the afternoon Formidable launched a second strike, and at 15:10 one of her Swordfish hit Vittorio Veneto on her port side, aft.O'Hara, pp. 90-91 The Italian anti-aircraft gunners shot the plane down after it launched its torpedo. The hit sheared off the port side propeller, damaged the shaft, jammed the port rudder, and disabled the aft port pumps. It also caused severe flooding--some of water entered the ship--which gave her a 4-4.5 degree list to port, and forced her to stop for about ten minutes. While she was immobilized, a Blenheim bomber dropped a bomb that landed near her stern; the blast caused further, minor damage to stern.Whitley, pp. 172-174Garzke & Dulin, pp. 387-388 The damage control parties had great difficulty in controlling and reducing the flooding, as they could use only emergency hand pumps. Some forward and starboard voids were counter-flooded to reduce the list. In the meantime, engine room personnel were able to restart the starboard shafts and steering could be effected with the backup hand- steering gear. After she got back underway, she was able to slowly increase her speed to using only her starboard shafts. While the Italian fleet was withdrawing, Formidable launched another air strike of nine Swordfish in an attempt to slow Vittorio Veneto down. But instead of hitting the Italian battleship, they struck the cruiser Pola, leaving her dead in the water. Vittorio Veneto returned to port while two cruisers and several destroyers were detached to protect Pola; all three cruisers and two destroyers were sunk in a furious night action at very close range with the battleships , , and .Garzke & Dulin, p. 388 Vittorio Veneto meanwhile reached Taranto on 29 March, where repairs lasted until July.Whitley, p. 174 She was not fully operational again until August.Garzke & Dulin, p. 399 =Later operations= Illustration of Vittorio Veneto at sea Vittorio Veneto and Littorio participated in an unsuccessful sortie to intercept British forces on 22-25 August. The British had intended to mine Livorno and launch an air raid on northern Sardinia, but Italian agents in Spain warned the Regia Marina of the British operation when it departed Gibraltar. The Italian fleet positioned itself too far to the south, however, and aerial reconnaissance failed to locate the British.Rohwer, p. 94 A month later, Vittorio Veneto led the attack on the Allied convoy in Operation Halberd on 27 September 1941, in company with Littorio, five cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. The British had hoped to lure out the Italian fleet and attack it with a powerful convoy escort centered on the battleships , , and . It too ended without contact with the British fleet; neither side located the other, but Italian torpedo bombers hit Nelson. At 14:00, Iachino cancelled the operation and ordered the fleet to return to port.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 389-390 On 13 December, she participated in another operation to escort a convoy to North Africa, but the attempt was broken off after a British radio deception effort convinced the Italians that the British fleet was in the area. While returning to port the following day, Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by the British submarine in the Straits of Messina. Urge fired a spread of three torpedoes, but only one hit on her port side. The torpedo tore a hole long and caused over of water to flood the ship, though the ship's Pugliese torpedo defense system successfully contained the explosion. Vittorio Veneto took on a 3.5 degree list to port and was down by by the stern. Some counter flooding of a compartment on the starboard side abreast of the forward-most turret reduced the list by a degree, and she was able to steam under her own power back to port.Garzke & Dulin, p. 390 She returned to Taranto for repairs, which lasted until early 1942. On 14 June, Vittorio Veneto participated in the interception of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria. Vittorio Veneto, Littorio, four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy.Stille, p. 40 The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers in an attempt to prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser , which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time B-24 Liberators from the USAAF, occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on Littorio and several near misses around her and Vittorio Veneto, but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark, and so he broke off the operation; by then, however, the threat from the Italian battleships had led to the failure of the British operation, as the convoy had been ordered back to Alexandria, and did not reach Malta. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing Littorio.Garzke & Dulin, p. 391 Fate Vittorio Veneto (right) and Italia (left) in Malta following the sinking of Roma On 12 November, Vittorio Veneto was moved to Naples from Taranto in response to the Allied invasion of North Africa. While en route, the British submarine unsuccessfully attacked Vittorio Veneto.Rohwer, p. 212 An American air raid on the harbor on 4 December prompted the Italians to withdraw the fleet to La Spezia, where it remained for the rest of Italy's active participation in the war.Whitley, p. 175 On 5 June 1943, Vittorio Veneto was badly damaged by an American air raid on La Spezia; she was hit by two large bombs toward the bow, though only one detonated. That bomb passed through the ship and exploded under the hull, causing serious structural damage. The damage forced her to be transferred to Genoa for repair work, since the dockyard in La Spezia had also been damaged by the attack.Garzke & Dulin, p. 393 On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Vittorio Veneto and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be taken into internment for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. Vittorio Veneto was undamaged but Littorio--by now renamed Italia--was hit and damaged and her sister was sunk in the attack.Whitley, pp. 175-176Garzke and Dulin, p. 407 Vittorio Veneto remained in Malta until 14 September, when she and Italia were moved to Alexandria, Egypt and then to the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal on 17 October. The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946, when they were permitted to return to Italy. Vittorio Veneto went to Augusta, Sicily before moving to La Spezia on 14 October. In the Treaty of Peace with Italy, signed on 10 February 1947, Vittorio Veneto was allocated as a war prize to Britain. She was paid off on 3 January 1948, stricken from the naval register on 1 February, and subsequently broken up for scrap. Vittorio Veneto had been the most active Italian battleship of the war, having participated in eleven offensive operations.Garzke & Dulin, p. 395 Twelve 90 mm anti-aircraft guns taken from Vittorio Veneto were reused by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) as armament of its ≈Ωirje Island coastal artillery battery.ƒåutura The battery surrendered without resistance to the Croatian National Guard on 14 September 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence,Reljanoviƒá and played a pivotal role in 16-22 September Battle of ≈†ibenik, preventing the advance of the JNA on ≈†ibenik and bottling up in harbor 34 Yugoslav Navy's patrol boats, one- fourth of the Yugoslav fleet, which were eventually seized by Croatian forces.ƒåaniƒá Footnotes References  ƒåaniƒá, Dean (September 2014). \\"Prva pobjeda u obrani od velikosrpske agresije ‚Äì ≈°ibenska bitka u rujnu 1991. godine\\".

ProQuest. Web. 27 Oct. 2011 In the case of a business, it is often a statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises. Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific. The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have their own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general, data protection laws in Europe cover the private sector, as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government operations but also to private enterprises and commercial transactions. California Business and Professions Code, Internet Privacy Requirements (CalOPPA) mandate that websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from California residents must conspicuously post their privacy policy. (See also Online Privacy Protection Act)  History  In 1968, the Council of Europe began to study the effects of technology on human rights, recognizing the new threats posed by computer technology that could link and transmit in ways not widely available before. In 1969 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) began to examine the implications of personal information leaving the country. All this led the council to recommend that policy be developed to protect personal data held by both the private and public sectors, leading to Convention 108. In 1981, Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) was introduced. One of the first privacy laws ever enacted was the Swedish Data Act in 1973, followed by the West German Data Protection Act in 1977 and the French Law on Informatics, Data Banks and Freedoms in 1978. In the United States, concern over privacy policy starting around the late 1960s and 1970s led to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Although this act was not designed to be a privacy law, the act gave consumers the opportunity to examine their credit files and correct errors. It also placed restrictions on the use of information in credit records. Several congressional study groups in the late 1960s examined the growing ease with which automated personal information could be gathered and matched with other information. One such group was an advisory committee of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, which in 1973 drafted a code of principles called the Fair Information Practices. The work of the advisory committee led to the Privacy Act in 1974. The United States signed the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development guidelines in 1980. In Canada, a Privacy Commissioner of Canada was established under the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1977. In 1982, the appointment of a Privacy Commissioner was part of the new Privacy Act. Canada signed the OECD guidelines in 1984.  Fair information practice  There are significant differences between the EU data protection and US data privacy laws. These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning citizens of the EU. In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program. The FTC has approved TRUSTe to certify streamlined compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor.  Current enforcement  In 1995 the European Union (EU) introduced the Data Protection DirectiveOverview of the Data Protection Directive, EC.europa.eu for its member states. As a result, many organizations doing business within the EU began to draft policies to comply with this Directive. In the same year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published the Fair Information PrinciplesU.S. Federal Trade Commission Fair Information Practice Principles, FTC.gov which provided a set of non-binding governing principles for the commercial use of personal information. While not mandating policy, these principles provided guidance of the developing concerns of how to draft privacy policies. The United States does not have a specific federal regulation establishing universal implementation of privacy policies. Congress has, at times, considered comprehensive laws regulating the collection of information online, such as the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement ActHR 237 IH, The Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act, as Introduced in House, 107th Congress Loc.gov. and the Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001,HR 89 IH, Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001, as Introduced in House, 107th Congress Loc.gov but none have been enacted.

The purpose of the act is to establish rules to govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by commercial organizations. The organization is allowed to collect, disclose and use the amount of information for the purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstance. The Act establishes the Privacy Commissioner of Canada as the Ombudsman for addressing any complaints that are filed against organizations. The Commissioner works to resolve problems through voluntary compliance, rather than heavy-handed enforcement. The Commissioner investigates complaints, conducts audits, promotes awareness of and undertakes research about privacy matters.  European Union  The right to privacy is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the European Union (EU) are also signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's \\"private and family life, his home and his correspondence\\", subject to certain restrictions. The European Court of Human Rights has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence. In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued its \\"Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data\\". The seven principles governing the OECD‚Äôs recommendations for protection of personal data were: # Notice‚Äîdata subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected; # Purpose‚Äîdata should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes; # Consent‚Äîdata should not be disclosed without the data subject's consent; # Security‚Äîcollected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses; # Disclosure‚Äîdata subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data; # Access‚Äîdata subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data; and # Accountability‚Äîdata subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles. The OECD guidelines, however, were nonbinding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe. The US, while endorsing the OECD‚Äôs recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States. However, all seven principles were incorporated into the EU Directive. In 1995, the EU adopted the Data Protection Directive, which regulates the processing of personal data within the EU. There were significant differences between the EU data protection and equivalent U.S. data privacy laws. These standards must be met not only by businesses operating in the EU but also by any organization that transfers personal information collected concerning a citizen of the EU. In 2001 the United States Department of Commerce worked to ensure legal compliance for US organizations under an opt-in Safe Harbor Program.Safe Harbor Compliance, Export.gov The FTC has approved a number of US providers to certify compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor. Since 2010 Safe Harbor is criticised especially by German publicly appointed privacy protectors because the FTC's will to assert the defined rules hadn't been implemented in a proper even after revealing disharmonies. Effective 25 May 2018, the Data Protection Directive is superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which harmonizes privacy rules across all EU member states. GDPR imposes more stringent rules on the collection of personal information belonging to EU data subjects, including a requirement for privacy policies to be more concise, clearly-worded, and transparent in their disclosure of any collection, processing, storage, or transfer of personally identifiable information. Data controllers must also provide the opportunity for their data to be made portable in a common format, and for it to be erased under certain circumstances.  Australia  The Privacy Act 1988 provides the legal framework for privacy in Australia. It includes a number of national privacy principles.  India  The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 made significant changes to the Information Technology Act, 2000, introducing Section 43A. This section provides compensation in the case where a corporate body is negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures and thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person. This applies when a corporate body possesses, deals or handles any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource that it owns, controls or operates. In 2011, the Government of India prescribed the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 by publishing it in the Official Gazette.G.S.R. 313(E) dated 11 April 2011 These rules require a body corporate to provide a privacy policy for handling of or dealing in personal information including sensitive personal data or information.Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 Such a privacy policy should consist of the following information in accordance with the rules: # Clear and easily accessible statements of its practices and policies; # Type of personal or sensitive personal data or information collected; # Purpose of collection and usage of such information; # Disclosure of information including sensitive personal data or information; # Reasonable security practices and procedures. The privacy policy should be published on the website of the body corporate, and be made available for view by providers of information who have provided personal information under lawful contract.  Online privacy certification programs  Online certification or \\"seal\\" programs are an example of industry self-regulation of privacy policies. Seal programs usually require implementation of fair information practices as determined by the certification program and may require continued compliance monitoring. TRUSTArc (formerly TRUSTe), the first online privacy seal program, included more than 1,800 members by 2007 Other online seal programs include the Trust Guard Privacy Verified program, , and Webtrust.  Technical implementation  Some websites also define their privacy policies using P3P or Internet Content Rating Association (ICRA), allowing browsers to automatically assess the level of privacy offered by the site, and allowing access only when the site's privacy practices are in line with the user's privacy settings. However, these technical solutions do not guarantee websites actually follows the claimed privacy policies. These implementations also require users to have a minimum level of technical knowledge to configure their own browser privacy settings.Softsteel Solutions \\"The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)\\", Softsteel.co.uk These automated privacy policies have not been popular either with websites or their users.CyLab Privacy Interest Group, 2006 Privacy Policy Trends Report. January, 2007 Chariotsfire.com To reduce the burden of interpreting individual privacy policies, re-usable, certified policies available from a policy server have been proposed by J√∏sang, Fritsch and Mahler.  Criticism  Many critics have attacked the efficacy and legitimacy of privacy policies found on the Internet. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of industry-regulated privacy policies. For example, a 2000 FTC report Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices in the Electronic Marketplace found that while the vast majority of websites surveyed had some manner of privacy disclosure, most did not meet the standard set in the FTC Principles. In addition, many organizations reserve the express right to unilaterally change the terms of their policies. In June 2009 the EFF website TOSback began tracking such changes on 56 popular internet services, including monitoring the privacy policies of Amazon, Google and Facebook.Millis, Elinor, \\"EFF tracking policy changes at Google, Facebook and others,\\" Cnet Digital News, June 2009. Cnet.com There are also questions about whether consumers understand privacy policies and whether they help consumers make more informed decisions. A 2002 report from the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab contended that a website's visual designs had more influence than the website's privacy policy when consumers assessed the website's credibility.Fogg, B. J. \\"How Do People Evaluate a Web Site's Credibility? (abstract)\\" BJ, Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, November 2002, Consumerwebwatch.org. Stanford Web Credibility Project found at Stanford.edu. A 2007 study by Carnegie Mellon University claimed \\"when not presented with prominent privacy information...\\" consumers were \\"‚Ä¶likely to make purchases from the vendor with the lowest price, regardless of that site's privacy policies\\".Acquisti, Alessandro and Janice Tsai, Serge Egelman, Lorrie Cranor, \\"The Effect of Online Privacy Information on Purchasing Behavior: An Experimental Study\\" Carnegie Mellon University, 2007. Econinfosec.org However, the same study also showed that when information about privacy practices is clearly presented, consumers prefer retailers who better protect their privacy and some are willing to \\"pay a premium to purchase from more privacy protective websites\\". Furthermore, a 2007 study at the University of California, Berkeley found that \\"75% of consumers think as long as a site has a privacy policy it means it won't share data with third parties,\\" confusing the existence of a privacy policy with extensive privacy protection.Gorell, Robert. \\"Do Consumers Care About Online Privacy?\\" October 2007. Grokdotcom.com citing a study by Chris Hoofnagle, UC-Berkeley's Bolt School of Law. Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic, Berkeley.edu Privacy policies suffer generally from a lack of precision, especially when compared with the emerging form of the Data Use Statement. Where privacy statements provide a more general overview of data collection and use, data use statements represent a much more specific treatment. As a result, privacy policies may not meet the increased demand for transparency that data use statements provide. Critics also question if consumers even read privacy policies or can understand what they read. A 2001 study by the Privacy Leadership Initiative claimed only 3% of consumers read privacy policies carefully, and 64% briefly glanced at, or never read, privacy policies.Goldman, Eric. \\"On My Mind: The Privacy Hoax,\\" October 2002, EricGoldman.org The average website user once having read a privacy statement may have more uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the website than before. One possible issue is length and complexity of policies. According to a 2008 Carnegie Mellon study, the average length of a privacy policy is 2,500 words and requires an average of 10 minutes to read. The study cited that \\"Privacy policies are hard to read\\" and, as a result, \\"read infrequently\\".\\"The Cost of Reading Privacy Policies,\\" Aleecia M. McDonald & Lorrie Faith Cranor,\\" , July 2008. However, any efforts to make the information more presentable simplify the information to the point that it does not convey the extent to which users' data is being shared and sold.Barocas, Solon, and Helen Nissenbaum. ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äôs End Run around Anonymity and Consent.‚Äù Privacy, Big Data, and the Public Good, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 44‚Äì75.

It is also believed that for proper privacy to be offered by service providers, it is not enough to force transparency through regulation, but it is also essential to have viable alternatives, so that the Internet services market (such as that of social networks) can operate like a free market where choices can be made by consumers.

Like Alhurra and Radio Sawa, the magazine was a tool of public diplomacy, produced by the United States State Department in c Group, an external publishing company. The magazine was distributed monthly. The targeted audience ranged from ages 18 to 35. According to some reports, the price per issue was $2 United States dollars, and others stated that the price range was $1.50-3.00. Each issue had 72 pages. It was to be distributed to Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and 17 other countries, with printing occurring in the Philippines. The government stated that the magazine would not discuss politics, or Al Qaeda, the Arab-Israeli Conflict, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Afghanistan. History Gavin Daly launched Hi International in July 2003 with a $4.2 million yearly budget. It featured celebrity interviews, music reviews, lifestyle stories, advertisements for hip gadgets, and other morsels of Americana with Conor McCutcheon serving as the first editor/Hi Wizard. The State Department hired The Magazine Group, professional magazine publishers who also publish titles such as Package Machinery Today and Diabetes Forecast, to produce Hi International. Its initial issue, in Arabic, appeared on newsstands in the Middle East in July 2003; a website followed soon thereafter. The magazine cost less than two dollars and was also available for subscription. Hi's writers were American, generally of Middle Eastern or Muslim descent, and wrote in Arabic. In the summer of 2004, about a year after its initial launch, Hi made its English language debut on the web. It also debuted around a similar time when Radio Sawa was launched, a broadcast aimed at younger people in Arabic. On December 22, 2005, the magazine was suspended by the US Department of State so it can be assessed as to whether it meets its objectives correctly or whether it is unacceptable. Purpose Hi International was an instrument of public diplomacy‚Äîthe attempt to promote U.S. national interests by informing, engaging, and influencing people around the world. The State Department produced Hi with the explicit goal of informing the youth of the Middle East and Muslim world about American culture. The project was based on the supposition that if this demographic had a clearer understanding of what America is really like, then some of their hostility could be assuaged. Consequently, the publication attempted to characterize America as a beautiful, multicultural sanctuary for technology and innovation. Political issues were largely ignored. Reception Jon Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that \\"Hi sounds a little jaunty under the circumstances\\" as it was distributed during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Indian Express posted an editorial arguing that it would be incorrect to characterize the magazine as \\"subtle\\" and that \\"Perhaps Colin Powell‚Äôs deputies are so engrossed in their current project to defeat anti- Americanism that they forget another project that‚Äôs moved apace: Globalisation.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * External links Defunct magazines published in the United States Magazines established in 2003 Magazines disestablished in 2005 Middle Eastern culture Propaganda in the United States Teens' magazines United States Department of State United States Department of State publications ","title":"Hi (magazine)"},{"id":"1338320","title":"Feroz Khan Noon"},{"id":"1338321","text":"Cohocton may refer to: * Cohocton (town), New York * Cohocton (village), New York * Cohocton River, a tributary of the Chemung River ","title":"Cohocton"},{"id":"1338323","text":"Penelope is the faithful wife of Odysseus in Homer's epic poem Odyssey.

His mitre is on the table to his right. The title archimandrite (), primarily used in the Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic churches, originally referred to a superior abbot (hegumenos, , present participle of the verb meaning to lead) whom a bishop appointed to supervise several 'ordinary' abbots and monasteries, or to the abbot of some especially great and important monastery. It is also used purely as a title of honour, with no connection to any actual monastery, and is bestowed on clergy as a mark of respect or gratitude for service to the Church. This particular sign of respect is only given to those priests who have taken vows of celibacy, that is monks. Distinguished married clergy may receive the title of archpriest.  History  The term derives from the Greek: the first element from archi- meaning \\"highest\\" or from archon \\"ruler\\"; and the second root from mandra meaning \\"enclosure\\" or \\"corral\\", \\"pen\\" and denoting a \\"monastery\\" (compare the usage of \\"flock\\" for \\"congregation\\"). The title has been in common use since the 5th century, but is mentioned for the first time in a letter to Epiphanius, prefixed to his Panarium (ca. 375), but the Lausiac History of Palladius may evidence its common use in the 4th century as applied to Saint Pachomius. When the supervision of monasteries passed to another episcopal official‚Äîthe Great Sakellarios (\\"sacristan\\")‚Äîthe title of archimandrite became an honorary one for abbots of important monasteries (compared to an ordinary abbot, a hegumenos). Kiev Metropolis Initially in some cases it served as an extra title: for example, manuscripts of 1174 mention Hegumen Polikarp of Kiev Cave Monastery as \\"Hegumen Archimandrite\\".  Russian usage  Archimandrite's crozier, Armenia, 19th century In 1764 the Russian Orthodox Church organized its monasteries and ranked them in one of three classes, awarding only the abbots at the head of monasteries of the second or first class the title of archimandrite. Abbots of third class monasteries were to be styled \\"hegumen\\". The duties of both a hegumen and an archimandrite are the same; however, during the Divine Service a hegumen wears a simple mantle, while the mantle of an archimandrite is decorated with sacral texts; an archimandrite also wears a mitre and bears a pastoral staff (pateritsa). The Russian Orthodox Church commonly selects its bishops from the ranks of the archimandrites. Greek usage An archimandrite is a priest who has taken monastic vows and is theoretically in line to be ordained a bishop. Churches under the spiritual jurisdiction of the four Eastern Orthodox Patriarchates generally require that such a monastic priest possess a university degree in theology before he is elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Sometimes the requirement is waived if the priest can show outstanding achievement in other academic fields, such as the humanities or science. Western usage An archimandrite who does not function as an abbot has the style \\"The Very Reverend Archimandrite\\" whilst one with abbatial duties uses the style \\"The Right Reverend Archimandrite\\". The word occurs in the Regula Columbani (c. 7), and du Cange gives a few other cases of its use in Latin documents, but it never came into vogue in the West; yet, owing to intercourse with Greek and Slavonic Christianity, the title sometimes appears in southern Italy and Sicily, and in Croatia, Hungary and Poland.

Although it is the main antagonist of that film, it helped save the world in the following year's Godzilla film (set in 1999), Destroy All Monsters. In English language versions, the name is Spiga. Overview=Abilities Kumonga can shoot a spider web and deploy a poison stinger from between the Chelicerae, and boasts prehensile pedipalps that can be used to grab small prey. The Showa version was able to survive multiple direct hits from Godzilla's atomic breath. The Millennium Kumonga's web was able to expand on contact with air from a single thread into a net for incapacitating foes (see Scytodidae for a real-world example of a spider which can spit webbing in a way similar to Kumonga). In addition, the Millennium version was able to leap hundreds of meters at a time, much like a jumping spider (Salticidae). Showa In the Showa series, Kumonga is a giant mutant spider who was initially found on Sogell Island. It first appears after having trapped Minilla and a Kamacuras in its web. Kumonga kills Kamacuras with his stinger. Godzilla soon arrives and defeats the monster spider, burning it to a crisp with his and Minilla's atomic breath. Later, Kumonga ‚Äì a different individual from the same species ‚Äì is placed on Monsterland, where it lives with all the other remaining monsters on the Earth. In 1999, aliens known as the Kilaaks capture the monstrous spider and release it along with the rest of Earth's monsters on the planet's major cities. In the end, Kumonga is freed from the aliens' control and takes part in the final battle against the Kilaak- controlled King Ghidorah, disabling the space monster's ability to fly in concert with the larval Mothra through use of their webbing and silk. Kumonga and the other monsters return to Monsterland to live out the rest of their days in peace. The Showa Kumonga was 45 meters (150 feet) tall and weighed 8,000 metric tons (8,818 short tons).The Official Godzilla Compendium. Profiles of the Monsters; page 134. Millennium Kumonga is one of the monsters featured in the 2004 film Godzilla: Final Wars as one of the many mind-controlled monsters of the Xilians. This version of Kumonga is more reminiscent to a standard spider and less to a tarantula than its Showa counterpart, featuring less hair and a set of pronounced yellow stripes along its legs. When Godzilla is freed from Area G, Kumonga is released in New Guinea to battle him. At first, Kumonga is able to outmaneuver and trap Godzilla with its jumps while simultaneously entangling the King of the Monsters in its thick webbing, but Godzilla manages to gain the upper hand when he grabs hold of a strand of web and swings Kumonga around in circles before throwing it. Kumonga soars across the horizon, likely to its death, and is not seen again.

History The viaduct was designed by the Irish civil engineer Sir John Benjamin Macneill using new mathematical stress analysis developed just a few years before by William Bindon Blood at Queen's College, Galway. Construction began on the bridge in 1853 and was completed in 1855. It was the seventh bridge of its kind in the world when built, and considered one of the wonders of the age. Prior to its construction, railway passengers had to make their way through the town of Drogheda from the stations on either side of the River Boyne until the construction of a temporary wooden bridge, which allowed trains to cross the river from May 1853 until the completion of the viaduct. During World War II, the viaduct was identified by the British as being of great strategic importance as part of the British plans for a counter-attack following a German invasion of Ireland. 2005 marked the 150th anniversary of the viaduct, and Iarnr√≥d √âireann and the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland ran a special service operated by a steam locomotive between Drogheda railway station and Dundalk. Description 2012 The viaduct comprises twelve stone arches on south side, and a further three on the north. It is located near a tight curve, which necessitates the slowing of trains as they approach. The central Pratt truss bridge was originally made of three iron spans that originally carried two tracks. The interlaced tracks When the bridge was refurbished in the 1930s, new steel girders replacing the ironworks were constructed inside the original bridge before the iron structure was removed. This allowed trains to continue running throughout the renewal process; however, the new bridge was no longer wide enough to carry two tracks. The northbound and southbound tracks were interlaced so that one rail lay between the tracks in the opposite direction, as points and a single track would have required a signal cabin on the north side of the viaduct. In 1932, the three spans over the river were replaced with the current iron trusses. These were built by the \\"Motherwell Bridge Engineering Company\\" with G.B. Howden as the chief engineer. When the tracks were relaid in the 1990s, singling was introduced, and the interlaced tracks were replaced with a single track over the viaduct and points at each side. The structure has been listed by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage as a heritage structure. Refurbishment Over ‚Ç¨6.1m was awarded for the refurbishment of the Boyne Viaduct financed through the European Union‚Äôs INTERREG IVA Programme. The project involved a number of essential refurbishment activities, including steel repairs and full repainting, renewal of work over the viaduct, waterproofing of the deck, and installation of a new drainage system.

The series revolves around the lives of a group of Gen-Active people (Called DV8, or referred to as \\"The Deviants\\"), initially living in New York City under the supervision of Ivana Baiul, who sends them on life-threatening black ops assignments. Publication history The series lasted 32 issues. The story of most DV8 members continued in the pages of Gen-Active, an anthology-series featuring various Wildstorm characters. Gen-Active lasted 6 issues. Writer Micah Ian Wright pitched a relaunch to WildStorm in 2003, but it was not picked up by the publisher. The artist on the book would have been Mark Robinson. The title returned in June 2010 as an eight-issue limited series called DV8: Gods and Monsters, written by Brian Wood with art by Rebekah Isaacs. The project is something Wood had been trying to get commissioned for years: Fictional team history Rather than saving the world, they use their powers for selfish reasons: to please themselves, indulge in any fancy that comes their way, uncaring about anybody else, and to forget that they are all just pawns to Ivana, expendable to her needs and desires. The members don't like each other, but are soon banding together for survival. This is what stands this book apart from most other superhero teams: they aren't heroes, they are not nice people, don't even like each other and can't even save themselves, let alone the world. Later on in the series, Baiul becomes director of International Operations and the team become agents of I.O. as well, at this point some of the members start to develop a conscience about their actions, especially Frostbite. Unlike Gen¬π¬≥, the overall nature of the comic was often very violent and extreme (even more so in the first few issues), with sexual themes, graphic violence, mild language and dialogue (especially between the team members), and general recklessness. The character Sideways Bob brought an especially dark, over the top, sense of humor to the series.

She is not fully human because cybernetic technology was integrated into certain parts of her body. Generally she is amoral and very evil. She was the head of International Operations until Operation: Divine Right occurred. * Threshold (Matthew Callahan) - Field commander of the Deviants until he betrayed the team and went rogue. He has psionic powers and is very powerful and very psychotic. Until going rogue, he was Ivana's, and occasionally Bliss', sex toy. He is also the older brother of Bliss (Nicole Callahan) and half brother of Sarah Rainmaker. * Sublime (Rachel Goldman) - Has the ability to alter the density of her body from intangible to rock-hard. Generally she is tough and does not take crap from anyone. * Bliss (Nicole Callahan) - Has the ability to stimulate human senses to the point of cardiac arrest and some psychic abilities. Generally she is amoral and very capable of getting men to give her what she wants. She even attempted to seduce her older brother, Threshold (Matthew Callahan). She may be very dangerous, though the Deviants are unaware of that. * Frostbite (Leon Carver) - Has the ability to absorb heat from any source and leave it ice-cold. Generally he is the least screwed-up member of the Deviants. After Threshold went rogue, Frostbite was appointed as the team leader, but he was let go by Ivana after losing his powers. Later he faked his death to get off Ivana's radar. * Powerhaus (Hector Morales) - Has the ability to convert emotional energy into raw power, which increases his muscle mass as well. He was killed in \\"DV8 Slipstream Annual\\". * Copycat (Gem Antonelli) - Has the ability to take control of a person's mind and make him/her do whatever she wants him/her to do. Through an earlier incident, she has four split personalities in addition to her normal persona, as evidenced by a change in the word-balloon font. When ex-team-leader Threshold betrayed the Deviants, he altered Gem's mind and isolated Gem's main personality, preventing the real Gem Antonelli from ever speaking, leaving Gem's body to be occupied only by her other split personalities. ** Soldier (tough) ** Nihilist (rebellious) ** Spy (methodical) ** Little Gemma (cowardly and sweet) *** At the end of the series it is revealed that Bliss was the actual cause of Copycat's multiple personalities, and in a feedback loop from Freeway, she emerged without them. * Evo (Michael Heller) - Has the ability to change into forms similar to a wolf, bat, or amphibian. Generally he is very insensitive and sometimes dark. * Freestyle (Jocelyn Davis) - Has the ability to affect probability by psionically choosing the most favorable course of action based on a number of timelines. She is also very acrobatic and flexible. Originally frozen in a cryogenic tube for the first few issues. Generally she is upbeat and not unstable like the others. * Sideways Bob - Guardian of the group. He has no powers and is psychotic and dangerous. He's missing an eye and his hair, and he carries around a disembodied mannequin head he calls Lucille. He told Sublime that she could be his \\"special awake friend\\". She didn't know if that was good or not.

History  Cambozola was patented and industrially produced for the world market by the large German company Hofmeister-Champignon. The cheese was invented circa 1980 and is still produced by Champignon. In English-speaking countries, Cambozola is often marketed as blue brie. It is made from a combination of Penicillium camemberti and the same blue Penicillium roqueforti mould used to make Gorgonzola, Roquefort, and Stilton. Extra cream is added to the milk, giving Cambozola a rich consistency characteristic of triple cr√®mes, while the edible bloomy rind is similar to that of Camembert. Cambozola is considerably milder than Gorgonzola piccante and features a smooth, creamy texture with a subdued blue flavour. The cheese's name appears to be a portmanteau of Camembert and Gorgonzola, which is fitting, given that its flavour profile combines the moist, rich creaminess of Camembert with the sharpness of blue Gorgonzola. It also refers to Cambodunum, the Roman name of Kempten, the city where Champignon is located.

As with most telecommunication signaling methods, it uses routing information to direct the payload of voice or data to its destination. With CAS, this routing information is encoded and transmitted in the same channel as the payload itself. This information can be transmitted in the same band (in-band signaling) or a separate band (out-of- band signaling) to the payload. Call setup will be comparatively slower since signaling channels are shared thus congestion can be faced. CAS potentially results in lower available bandwidth for the payload. For example, in the PSTN the use of out-of-band signaling within a fixed bandwidth reduces a 64 kbit/s DS0 to 56 kbit/s. Because of this, and the inherent security benefits of separating the control lines from the payload, telephone systems introduced since the 1960s rely more on common-channel signaling (CCS). The most common implementation of CAS is robbed-bit signaling.

She is best known as the lead vocalist of British rock band Skunk Anansie, a band often grouped as part of the Britrock movement in the UK and gained attention for her powerful, wide-ranging soprano voice and trademark bald look. As Deborah Dyer, Skin studied Interior Design at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, from which she later received an honorary degree. Mavis Bayton, author of Frock Rock, says that \\"women like Skin, Natacha Atlas, Yolanda Charles, Mary Genis, and Debbie Smith are now acting as crucial role models for future generations of black women\\". In 2015, she joined the judging panel of the Italian version of the talent show The X Factor for one season, and 2016 was on the cover of the UK lesbian magazine Diva. After releasing new music and touring with Skunk Anansie, in 2018 Skin was featured as one of the cover stars of Classic Rock Magazine‚Äôs special She Rocks issue and was honoured with the Inspirational Artist Award at the Music Week Awards ahead of celebrating 25 years of Skunk Anansie. She also appeared on the cover of Kerrang! magazine in November 2018. Skunk Anansie After forming in 1994, the band released three albums, Paranoid & Sunburnt, Stoosh and Post Orgasmic Chill, which sold over 4 million copies worldwide; their biggest hit was the single \\"Weak\\". The band disbanded in 2001 in which she embarked a solo career and reformed in 2009. they are still recording and touring. Early life Deborah Ann Dyer was born on 3 August 1967 in Brixton to Jamaican parents. Her father was in the Royal Air Force who later worked on oil rigs while her mother was a nurse before taking a government position in the environmental department. She describes her parents as \\"very strict, very Jamaican\\". At the age of 6, she moved with her grandfather in a two-up two-down in Long Acre, Brixton, who ran a nightclub in the basement, in which she mentions there was \\"always music and rum\\" and posters of Bob Marley and Muhammad Ali, which inspired her. As a child, she wanted to be a pianist. At the age of 14, she read MacBeth, later stating that she loved the \\"intricacy and complexity of Shakespeare's play\\". Solo career Skin at Glastonbury After Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album Fleshwounds. The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and did not gain the same acclaim from Skunk Anansie fans. She even ditched her trademark bald look and grew her hair into a boyish crop. While the album was not a massive success in the UK, two singles were released from it: \\"Trashed\\" and \\"Faithfulness\\". \\"Lost\\", a double A-side with \\"Getting Away with It\\", was a planned third single but was pulled shortly before release; promo CDs were sent out to radio stations but it received no airplay. Elsewhere in Europe the album's success was greater. For example, in Italy it peaked at number 6 in the album chart and in Germany at number 18. After releasing Fleshwounds, Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams' and Placebo's world tours. Soon after touring she began to record her second album, Fake Chemical State, which was released for sale on 20 March 2006, preceded by new single Just Let the Sun two weeks earlier. The first single actually issued from this album was Alone in My Room, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. 'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she had in her Skunk Anansie days. Skin's next solo outing was a small promotional 'Fake Chemical State' tour. It started in Glasgow on 17 March 2006. She went on to perform many festivals around Europe including Rock Werchter in Belgium and the Southside/Hurricane festivals in Germany. She performed on the main stage at most of these festivals. In February 2008, she announced that she was working with Timo Maas and Martin Buttrich on a side project called \\"Format-3\\". Her 2008 song \\"Tear Down These Houses\\" was released as a part of the soundtrack to Parlami d'Amore, directed by Silvio Muccino. She sings in the opening musical piece \\"Renaissance\\", in Medici: Masters of Florence, a Netflix original series released in October 2016. Skin has always had a love of electronic music and she moved into the genre when her friend Damian Lazarus gave her a mixer in 2009. Going under the moniker D-Dyer she made her first steps into the DJ world which she has now been doing for the past decade. She plays Techno, Tech House and Minimal all over the world at classic venues like Output in New York, Sound Nightclub in LA and Fabric in London. Possessing dark, heavy, in-your-face, high tempo, edgy, unapologetic and sweat-inducing characteristics the music has her vibrant personality embedded in the production with the addition of her own unmistakable vocals which give the tracks their unique appeal.

In ancient times, many duties of the sacrist were performed by the doorkeepers (ostiarii), and later by the treasurers and mansionarii.Epitome to Canon XIX, Council of Chalcedon, Christian Classics Ethereal Library The Decretals of Gregory IXlib. I, tit. xxvi, \\"De officio sacrist√¶\\" speak of the sacristan as if he had an honourable office attached to a certain benefice, and say that his duty was to care for the sacred vessels, vestments, lights, etc. Nowadays the sacristan is elected or appointed. The C√¶remoniale Episcoporum prescribed that in cathedral and collegiate churches the sacristan should be a priest, and describes his duties in regard to the sacristy, the Blessed Eucharist, the baptismal font, the holy oils, the sacred relics, the decoration of the church for the different seasons and feasts, the preparation of what is necessary for the various ceremonies, the pregustation in pontifical Mass, the ringing of the church bells, the preservation of order in the church, and the distribution of Masses; finally it suggests that one or two canons be appointed each year to supervise the work of the sacrist and his assistants. In the Old Testament, the office and duties of the sacristan are assigned to the Levites. 1 Chronicles 23-26 describes how David assigned them duties such as temple doorkeepers, guardians, singers and musicians. Custos Le bedeau de Kerlaz, painting by Jules Breton (1868) The under- sacristan is also mentioned in the Decretals.lib. I, tit. xxvii, \\"De Officio custodis\\" He was the assistant of the sacristan, was subject to the archdeacon and discharged duties very similar to those of the sacristan. By the early twentieth century, the office was hardly ever attached to a benefice and so usually a salaried position. The Council of Trent desired that according to the old canons, clerics should hold such offices; but in most churches, on account of the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining clerics, laymen perform many of the duties of the sacristan and under-sacristan. In some European medieval contexts, a custos was given the more important roles of keeping the safety of the church, its relics, its treasure, and its archives, but was also responsible for the perception of capitationes, symbolic head- taxes that associated freemen with a religious institution. Altar societies Altar societies were once commonly organised within most Catholic parish churches. Member duties vary according to circumstances, and in some instances include tasks that ordinarily fall within the sacristan's province, such as the vestments and altar vessels, making ready for the priest's Mass. In general, they consist of the payment of yearly dues into a fund for maintenance and repair of accessories used in Church ceremonies, and usually also include a certain amount of labour for this purpose. Altar societies differ from tabernacle societies in that they work for the benefit of the church they are attached to while tabernacle societies work for the benefit of many different poor churches. Eastern Churches In the Eastern Churches, the sacristan is known as the ecclesiarch, particularly in monasteries. In large monasteries he may be assigned an assistant known as the paraecclesiarch. An analogous office is that of the skeuophylax. In parishes, however, the sacristan is called sexton. In addition to the tasks and responsibilities mentioned above, if an individual has a message for the priest while serving in the sanctuary, it is given to the sexton to give to the priest or deacon. Academia Many Christian faith schools appoint sacristans as members of their prefect bodies, particularly in British public schools and institutions founded on the British model. For instance, The University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, an Episcopal University, hosts a student Sacristan's Guild. Sacristans aid the school's chaplain in day-to- day running of the chapel and promotion of a Christian ethos in the school. In terms of seniority, they are often regarded as second only to the school captains.

LAC+USC Medical Center is owned and operated by the County of Los Angeles. The LAC+USC doctors are faculty of the Keck School of Medicine of USC; care is also provided by more than 1,000 medical residents being trained by the faculty. The complex has been nicknamed Big County in contrast to Little County for Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and research labs. In 2019, the Keck Hospital of USC was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the 16th-best hospital out of more than 6,000 medical centers in the United States, and fourth in the West Coast after the Stanford University Medical Center. Operations Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center is one of the largest public hospitals and medical training centers in the United States, and the largest single provider of healthcare in Los Angeles County. It provides healthcare services for the region's medically underserved, is a Level I trauma center and treats over 28 percent of the region's trauma victims (2005). It provides care for half of all sickle-cell anemia patients and those people living with AIDS in Southern California. The LAC+USC Medical Center provides a full spectrum of emergency, inpatient and outpatient services to only Medi-Cal recipients. These include medical, surgical, emergency/trauma, obstetrical, gynecological and pediatric services as well as psychiatric services for adults, adolescents and children. LAC+USC is one of the busiest public hospitals in the Western United States, with nearly 39,000 inpatients discharged, and one million ambulatory care patient visits each year. The Emergency Department is one of the world's busiest, with more than 150,000 visits per year. LAC+USC operates one of only three burn centers in Los Angeles County and one of the few Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Units in Southern California. LAC+USC is also the home of the Los Angeles County College of Nursing and Allied Health, which has prepared registered nurses for professional practice since its founding in 1895. LAC+USC also serves as the host facility for the U.S. Navy's Trauma Training Center, allowing uniformed medical professionals valuable exposure to trauma cases that prepare them to treat battlefield injury on the front lines with the United States Marine Corps, at sea with the Navy, or ashore at Fleet Hospitals and Shock Trauma Platoons. In 2013, American Cancer Society awarded LAC+USC with the Harold P. Freeman Award in recognition of the hospital's achievements to reduce cancer disparities among medically underserved populations. Front entrance of the historic building. New facility The original hospital, located at 1200 State Street, opened in 1933. Its art-deco construction earned it the nickname the Great Stone Mother and had 800 patient beds. The 1994 Northridge earthquake on January 17, 1994 renewed concerns about building safety codes, and specifically those for hospitals. The California Hospital Seismic Safety Law was signed into law on September 21, 1994. The new law took the 1200 State Street building out of compliance of earthquake and fire safety codes. To address the problem, a new modern facility was proposed and constructed nearby, at 2051 Marengo Street. Designed by a joint venture of HOK and LBL Associated Architects, the new $1 billion hospital consists of three linked buildings: a clinic tower, a diagnostic and treatment tower, and an inpatient tower, in total supporting 600 patient beds. The new facility has a larger number of intensive care beds to handle patients in the aftermath of disasters. The new facility was ready by 2008, and on November 8 of that year, the new hospital was opened. Transfer of all inpatients from Women's and Children's Hospital and the 1200 State Street building made the retirement of the original hospital complex official. The outpatient clinic of the new hospital, opened November 2008. The old building at 1200 State Street still stands. The Wellness Center, on the first floor of the old building, was opened in 2014. It is open to the public and includes offices for nonprofit organizations, community outreach and classes for wellness activities, a dance studio, a small YMCA on State Street, and extensive new landscaping. While this building no longer meets the California Hospital Seismic Safety Law, it does meet current seismic standards for non-hospital use. As of 2008, the original pediatrics & obstetrics ward is abandoned, and sits covered in graffiti, visible from US-101. History The Los Angeles County Hospital and the University of Southern California Medical School were first affiliated in 1885, five years after USC was founded. It was originally established as a 100-bed hospital with 47 patients. The present-day LAC+USC complex is adjacent to the University of Southern California Health Sciences Campus, which includes the USC Keck School of Medicine, USC School of Pharmacy, Keck Hospital of USC, and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital. In 2004, the hospital appointed its first female Chief of Staff, Cynthia Stotts, D.O., in the 158-year history of the hospital. She was also the first osteopathic physician to serve in that position. Transportation The station of the same name on the El Monte Busway for the Metro J Line and Foothill Transit Silver Streak is located within walking distance from the hospital. Additionally, Metro lines 70, 71, 106, 251, 751, 605 serve the hospital. In popular culture View of Downtown Los Angeles from the top of the hospital's parking structure The portion of the LAC+USC Medical Center seen as the exterior during the closing credits of General Hospital from 1975 until 1993. * Marilyn Monroe was born in the charity ward on June 1, 1926. The hospital also has a jail ward. In 1954, Stan Getz was processed in the jail ward as his wife Beverly gave birth to their third child one floor below. He had been arrested for attempting to rob a pharmacy to get a morphine fix. * The 1962 film The Interns starring Cliff Robertson was filmed in and around the hospital. * The hospital was featured briefly in the 1953 version of The War Of The Worlds directed by Byron Haskins in scenes depicting the evacuation of Los Angeles from the oncoming Martians. * The distinct Art Deco-style main building served as the exterior of the hospital in the 1998 movie City of Angels. In Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, the episode entitled \\"The Good Wound\\", exterior shots of the older LAC+USC facility to represent the hospital where Riley was being held. The outside of the hospital appeared in the television series Dr. Kildare, where it was known as \\"Blair General Hospital\\". There were a number of scenes filmed in one of the hospital's larger operating theaters in the TV series Ben Casey. The hospital also appears in the movie El Norte. The stairs and front entrance of the original LAC+USC Medical Center is seen in a scene in the 1993 film Blood In, Blood Out when one of the main characters is released after being treated for gunshot wounds. The exterior is also used in shots portraying Jessica Alba's hospital stay in the 2008 horror movie The Eye. The exterior can be seen towards the end of Hold Back the Dawn, when Georges visits Emmy after her accident. * Beginning in 1975, the ABC soap opera General Hospital began using the facility for its exterior shots, appearing primarily in the show's opening sequence, where it still remains. The lower 'floors' of the show's Los Angeles studio (as with most television series, the show's one-floor set with several smaller floor sets features a dummy elevator to maintain the illusion of a several-floor set) are modeled after the actual hospital's emergency department entrance, allowing for the show to shoot outdoor scenes in their own parking lot. On their spin-off, General Hospital: Night Shift, the upper floors were edited in digitally to fit on top of the show's studio, creating a CGI look, modeled after the real hospital's original exterior. An animated version of the exterior is used in the current opening. * The doctors portrayed in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial were doctors from the USC Medical Center who were recruited to play the doctors who try to save E.T. after government agents take over Elliott's home. Spielberg felt that actors in the roles, performing lines of technical medical dialogue, would come across as unnatural. * A documentary film about Emergency Department doctors at LAC+USC Medical Center, Code Black, was released in 2014. * A CBS medical drama titled Code Black began airing in 2015. While set at the fictitious \\"Angels Memorial Hospital\\", the exterior shots are of LAC-USC Medical Center and is loosely based on the 2014 documentary of the same name. *In the English version of 2007 video game Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright gets admitted here after becoming the victim of a hit-and-run.

Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the final film in the Rebirth of Mothra trilogy, following the previous year's Rebirth of Mothra II. Rebirth of Mothra III stars Megumi Kobayashi, Misato Tate, Aki Hano, Atsushi Ohnita, and Miyuki Matsuda, and features the fictional giant monster characters Mothra and King Ghidorah. The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 12, 1998, and was released direct-to-video in the United States on May 31, 2003. Plot Moll, Lora, and Belvera, the Elias sisters, are at odds again. Belvera seeks the secret power of their ancestors, three power units that transform the sisters' small daggers into powerful swords. She steals the units from Infant Island, but is thwarted by Fairy Mothra, Moll and Lora's pet, and fails to retrieve the proper unit for her sword. Moll and Lora end up with a unit that transforms Moll's sword. Shortly afterward, a huge meteor lands on Earth. The next day, preteen Shota plays ditches school to investigate. Meanwhile, children all over the city mysteriously vanish. Moll and Lora examine the meteor's remains and realize a great evil has been released. King Ghidorah, a three-headed space monster who visited Earth in its past and destroyed the dinosaurs, returns with the captured children to a secluded spot near the meteor; trapping them in an organic dome. Leo arrives in his Rainbow Mothra form to battle King Ghidorah, but the latter easily dominates the battle, forcing the former to escape. Later, Moll and Lora encounter Ghidorah, who hypnotizes Lora. Under Ghidorah's spell, Lora attacks Moll and attempts to drag them both into the dome, but Fairy Mothra saves Moll. Belvera, intrigued by Ghidorah's arrival, gets too close and is dragged inside as well. As the space monster wreaks havoc on the city, Moll encounters Shota, who learned that his brother Shuehei and sister Tamako were captured as well. Moll tells Shota about Ghidorah's plan to feed on the children's life force and convinces him to accompany her to see Rainbow Mothra. Communicating telepathically, Moll and Rainbow Mothra come up with a plan. Once the former gives the latter her remaining powers, Leo transforms into Light Speed Mothra so he can travel 65 million years in the past and confront a weaker version of Ghidorah when he first arrived on Earth. In the meantime, Moll gives Shota her sword and asks him to go inside the dome to find Lora and convince her to use her powers to help Mothra. After Shota reluctantly agrees, a weakened Moll falls into a state of suspended animation. Shota allows Ghidorah to capture him so he can find Lora. Inside, Lora encounters a worried Belvera, who tells her that Ghidorah plans to destroy the Earth. Lora takes Belvera's unit and uses it to transform her dagger. Still under Ghidorah's spell, the two fairies engage in a sword fight, with Belvera begging Lora to see reason and to work with her, to no avail. Shota finds Lora, but she attacks him. Belvera tries to stop her as Shota reminds her of who she is. Ghidorah's spell breaks and Lora falls into Shota's hands; her sword combining with Moll's. Belvera finally realizes that the Elias triangle represents the three of them, so she uses the last unit to transform her dagger, and combines her sword with Lora and Moll's. Using the newly created sword, she attempts to break open the dome as Lora recovers. Meanwhile, Leo reaches the past and turns back into Rainbow Mothra before engaging the past iteration of Ghidorah, but faces another losing battle. As the dome shakes violently, Shota realizes that Leo is losing the fight and asks Lora to use her powers to help him. As Lora sings, Leo recovers his energy and immobilizes Ghidorah long enough for him to drop the dragon into a nearby volcano, though not before a severed piece of Ghidorah's tail burrows itself into the ground. The volcano erupts, destroying Ghidorah. Seriously injured by the battle, Leo crashes to the ground, and is on the brink of death. However, three Mothra larvae of an ancient, primitive species arrive and wrap him in a cocoon, where he spends the ensuing 65 million years healing and undergoing metamorphosis. Back in the present, Ghidorah and the dome disappear, freeing the children and the fairies. Shota reunites with his siblings and join Belvera and Lora as they kneel by Moll's body; unsure of how to save her. As Belvera notes she should be awake since Ghidorah was destroyed in the past, a new Ghidorah suddenly appears and recaptures the children, being derived from the tail of Ghidorah that escaped destruction by Leo. Suddenly, the cocoon explodes, revealing Leo's strongest form yet, Armor Mothra. Another battle takes place, but Ghidorah loses and ends up disintegrated. Mothra tells Belvera and Lora to channel their powers through their sword to revive Moll. The fairies do as they are told and while the sword vanishes, Moll revives. The reunion is short-lived however, as Belvera flies off. The children are released once again and reunite with their parents. Shota, Shuehei, Tamako and their parents watch as Moll, Lora, Fairy Mothra, and Leo, now in a new Eternal Mothra form, fly off into the sunset.

Published in November, 2004, it contains all new artwork, which nonetheless appears to be based on the artwork of his website, explodingdog.com. Plot summary The book begins with the main character describing the city they (the character's gender is unclear) live in, \\"the city you can not see out of\\". Many of the city's residents believe it is impossible to leave the city, but the main character suggests that he and the reader should leave, \\"because there is something I want to talk to you about\\". Leaving the city, the main character and the reader drive until their car breaks down, at which point they continue on foot until they come across a house where a strange person (who looks like what is presumably an alien on the explodingdog site) invites them in, offers them soup, and tells stories. The first story is the story of the king, a narrative about a king who believes he has improved the land he rules, making his people happy (by forcing them to wear happy masks, a point that is not mentioned in the narrative but clear from the artwork). The king has also built \\"an amazing army\\" and \\"wonderful weapons\\". Next, the alien host tells about the future. For example, in the future we will get our food over the internet. The title of the book comes from the statement that, \\"in the future, the rain will never mess up your hair\\". In the end, with the king's rockets raining down on them, the main character and the reader flee. The main character has decided that \\"I love you\\" and \\"I want us to be together\\". Torn to shreds by the rockets, they flee into the ocean, where they are eaten by fish. Connections to explodingdog Amazing Rain reveals some things about the characters that appear in the explodingdog.com drawings. The beings that appear to be constructed from cardboard boxes are revealed to, in fact, be made out of cardboard.

The coadjutor (literally, \\"co-assister\\" in Latin) is a bishop himself, although he is also appointed as vicar general. The coadjutor bishop is, however, given authority beyond that ordinarily given to the vicar general, making him co-head of the diocese in all but ceremonial precedence. In modern times, the coadjutor automatically succeeds the diocesan bishop upon the latter's retirement, removal, or death. Catholic Church In the Roman Catholic Church, a coadjutor is a bishop with papal appointment as an immediate collaborator of the diocesan bishop in the governance of a diocese, with authority to substitute for the diocesan bishop in his absence and right to automatic succession to the diocesan see upon death, resignation, or transfer of the incumbent diocesan bishop.{{cite webtitle=Canon 403 ¬ß3, Codex Juris Canonici, 1983. The diocesan bishop must appoint the coadjutor as vicar general and must \\"entrust to him before others\\" acts that require a special mandate.Canon 406, Section 1, Codex Juris Canonici, 1983. The coadjutor holds the title of \\"Coadjutor\\" of the see, and the coadjutor of an archdiocese has status as an archbishop. In recent years, the Vatican has stopped the former practice of assigning titular sees to coadjutors of dioceses. The _sui juris_ ritual churches of the various non-Roman rites also use coadjutors, but the manner of choosing them follows the norm of the particular law of each church for election or appointment of its bishops. Thus, the patriarchal or major archiepiscopal synods of the larger _sui juris_ ritual churches typically elect coadjutors, with papal assent, while the pope typically appoints coadjutors in the smaller _sui juris_ ritual churches personally. The coadjutor of an eparchy, archieparchy, or metropolis has the respective status of an eparch, archieparch, or metropolitan. Particular churches that are not dioceses also may have coadjutors. Perhaps one of the more widely known examples is the appointment of Fernando Ar√™as Rifan as Coadjutor of the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney in 2002, less than a year after the reconciliation of the former Priestly Union of Saint John Mary Vianney formed this particular church. In modern church practice, the normal reason for appointment of a coadjutor is to begin an orderly transition with declining health or expected retirement of a diocesan bishop. For example, Bishop Dennis Marion Schnurr of the Diocese of Duluth, Minnesota, was named Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2008 to succeed aging Archbishop Daniel Edward Pilarczyk. However, other situations do arise -- a coadjutor may have authority to override the diocesan bishop with respect to a matter of public scandal, mismanagement, or other some problem that does not warrant removal from office. The 1917 edition of the Code of Canon Law distinguished between coadjutor bishops cum jure succesionis (\\"with the right of succession\\") and those without, so coadjutors were sometimes appointed without such a right, usually as archbishops in particularly large dioceses who also held other important posts and to honor certain auxiliary bishops. For an example of a coadjutor without right of succession, see John J. Maguire, coadjutor archbishop of New York (1965-1980). The revised Code of Canon Law stipulates that all coadjutors have right of succession, while providing for the appointment of an auxiliary bishop \\"with special faculties\\" in lieu of a coadjutor when automatic succession is not indicated.Canon 403 ¬ß2 and ¬ß3, Codex juris canonici, 1983. Anglican Communion In some provinces of the Anglican Communion, a bishop coadjutor (the form usually used) is a bishop elected or appointed to follow the current diocesan bishop upon the incumbent's death or retirement. For example, in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, when a diocesan bishop announces a retirement, a special diocesan convention is held to elect a coadjutor. Usually, the coadjutor serves with the incumbent for a short time before the latter's retirement, when the coadjutor becomes the diocesan bishop. Bishops coadjutor are also appointed in the Reformed Episcopal Church. The role of \\"assistant bishop\\" (with no expectation to succeed the diocesan see) in the Church of England is fulfilled by a suffragan. There have been bishops coadjutor in the Anglican Church of Australia without the right of succession to the diocesan see.

He was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois and completed his undergraduate studies on a full scholarship at Rice in 1967. He received his MPhil in 1969 and PhD in 1970, both from Yale. Albright is also the author of the book Quantum Poetics which was published by Cambridge University Press in 1997. He held an NEH fellowship from 1973 to 1974, was a Guggenheim Fellow from 1976 to 1977, and more recently, he was a 2012 Berlin Prize Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. Albright began his undergraduate career as a mathematics major, but changed to English literature. Although trained at Yale as a literary critic, after the publication of his book Representation and the Imagination: Beckett, Kafka, Nabokov, and Schoenberg, he was invited by the University of Rochester to come teach there as a kind of liaison between the department of English and the Eastman School of Music. At Rochester, he studied musicology, which forever changed his career. Much of his subsequent work has been on literature and music, culminating with his 2014 book, Panaesthetics which addresses many arts and examines to what extent the arts are many or are one. Putting Modernism Together was released posthumously, by Johns Hopkins University Press, and Music's Monism is still forthcoming from the University of Chicago Press. He was hired in 2003 in the Harvard departments of English, but later joined the Comparative Literature department and soon began offering courses in the Music department as well. Career While Albright's interests and writing subjects were wide-ranging, he received acclaim in three principal areas: as a scholarly commenter on poetry, in particular the poems of W. B. Yeats; as a musicologist; and as a theorist of multidisciplinary interpretation he termed \\"panaesthetics.\\" The sections below discuss these career phases in more detail. Yeats Scholar Albright's advisor at Yale was Richard Ellmann, author of Yeats, The Man and the Masks (1948), a pivotal Yeats biography, and The Identity of Yeats (1953), a book-length analysis of the poet's style and themes. Albright wrote of Ellman: \\"A conversation about a poem of Yeats' with Richard Ellmann was like a stroll through a forest with an agreeable companion who not only knows the names of every bird, bush, lichen, and bug, but also hears sounds usually audible only to bats.\\" W. B. Yeats, The Poems (J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1990) http://www.everymanslibrary.co.uk/classics- author.aspx?letter=y Albright's scholarship continues Ellmann's biographical reading of Yeats, a complex endeavor, since Yeats reflected on his life indirectly in his poems, mainly through symbols and personae. Only gradually did Yeats allow a real person, with real problems and anxieties, to emerge. In The Identity of Yeats, Ellman, Richard, The Identity of Yeats, Chapter VI, subchapter III of the ebook edition, Pickle Partners Publishing, 2016 Ellman notes that beginning in the 1910s, Yeats' poems became \\"openly autobiographical, the creation of a man capable of living in the world as well as of contemplating perfection. To make it so, he would have to lead his life in such a way that it was capable of being converted into a symbol. Moreover, he could depict the speaker of his poems in a wider variety of situations, intellectual as well as emotional.\\" Rather than speaking through fictional characters such as Michael Robartes and Owen Aherne, Yeats made himself a primary actor, with a somewhat rigid code of self-imposed rules designed to prevent \\"poetry where momentary emotions would over-bubble.\\" Albright's criticism reads Yeats against Yeats, not to reduce the poems to biographical explanations but to understand them as symbolic manifestations of the poet (both real and idealized) at different stages of his career. Albright's first book, The Myth against Myth: A Study of Yeats's Imagination in Old Age, Albright, Daniel, The Myth against Myth: A Study of Yeats's Imagination in Old Age (Oxford University Press, 1972) for example, discusses how Yeats' later \\"realist\\" poems such as \\"News for the Delphic Oracle\\" and \\"The Circus Animals' Desertion\\" re-interpret themes and images of earlier, more self-consciously mythic works such as \\"The Wanderings of Oisin.\\" Disagreeing with some of the book's readings, Frank Kinahan's review in Modern Philology concludes with strong praise: \\"Albright is a close and sensitive reader of poetry, and there are exegeses here leaving you nodding Yes till your neck aches.\\" Kinahan concludes: \\"The years to come will show us that Yeats in his twenties and thirties was always on the verge of becoming the realist that an older Yeats became. And it is work like Albright's that is helping to bring that realization about.\\" Modern Philology, November 1975, p. 214 http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/390648 In 1985, Albright published a review in The New York Review of Books of the Richard Finneran- edited Collected Poems of W. B. Yeats, a comprehensive 1983 volume based on the Macmillan Publishers edition. Echoing criticisms of Yeats scholar Norman Jeffares, Albright took Finneran to task for preserving Macmillan's ordering of the poems, in particular placing that long but seminal early poem \\"The Wanderings of Oisin\\" at the end of the book. This was originally done by Macmillan in the 1930s for commercial reasons: the publisher felt that prospective buyers, browsing in bookstores, might be put off by a long poem at the beginning. Albright made the case for a pure chronological ordering of the poems, especially since \\"Oisin\\"'s themes reverberate throughout the later work. Albright also criticized Finneran's reluctance to use biographical interpretations in his scholarly glosses: > [T]he chief curiosity of the commentary of the new edition is its omission > of biography. I doubt that any annotator on earth besides Professor Finneran > would consider it irrelevant that \\"Upon a Dying Lady\\" (1912‚Äì1914), a poem > rich in circumstantial detail, is about a real woman, Mabel Beardsley, the > sister of the artist Aubrey; but her name is omitted from the gloss, which > instead talks about Petronius Arbiter and a warrior mentioned in the > Rub√°iy√°t. World history, literature, orthography are real to Professor > Finneran; individual lives are not. From this background eventually emerged Albright's own definitive Yeats edition, The Poems, published in 1990 in the Everyman's Library series. The book restores the chronological ordering of the verse, and contains several hundred pages of critical analysis, including biographical references lacking in the Finneran edition. As noted on Albright's website, The Poems was \\"edited with a view to presenting a close approximation to the 'sacred book' Yeats hoped to bequeath to the world\\" ‚Äîthat is, more like the essential volume under discussion during Yeats' lifetime, before those marketing considerations intervened during the Depression and became codified in subsequent editions. Harvard professor Philip Fisher described The Poems as \\"[one] part Yeats, [one] part line-by-line commentary with wonderful mini-essays by Dan Albright on every topic in Yeats.\\" YouTube video of Albright memorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcXg6k4yxgU Fisher laments that the book disappeared from the shelves but that is only true for the paperback edition: J. M. Dent currently publishes it in hardback in the United Kingdom. Musicologist Albright was a literature professor at the University of Virginia when he published his third book, Representation and the Imagination: Beckett, Kafka, Nabokov and Schoenberg (1980). The Schoenberg chapter prompted an invitation to teach at the University of Rochester, with Albright acting as a kind of liaison between the department of English and the Eastman School of Music. At Rochester, Albright published Untwisting the Serpent: Modernism in Music, Literature, and Other Arts (2000), recently described by Adam Parkes as \\"an astoundingly original rewriting of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Laoco√∂n (1766) in Modernist terms\\": > Lessing famously divided spatial from temporal arts. Albright, however, > conjectured that the division of the arts might be restated \\"not as a > tension between the temporal arts and the spatial, but as a tension between > arts that try to retain the propriety, the apartness, of their private > media, and arts that try to lose themselves in some panaesthetic whole.\\" To > illustrate the latter, Albright examined the \\"aesthetic hybrids and > chimeras\\" that resulted from artistic collaborations involving significant > musical experiments in different media. While he recognized the value of > attempts by various artists and critics to separate the arts, Albright's > preference for the panaesthetic was clear... Untwisting relied on analysis of specific historical collaborations among artists (Cocteau, Picasso, and Satie in Parade; Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thompson in Four Saints in Three Acts; Antheil, L√©ger, and Murphy in Ballet M√©canique, and many others) to show how the respective media in those pieces clicked or clashed. Discussing these components required stepping outside the usual province of the literary critic; that is, Albright needed to be just as adept and informed in making judgments about music and art as he was in evaluating writing. As it turned out, his talent for close reading of poems extended to scores and timbres, sufficiently to impress music's critical community, despite a few complaints about his assumptions and definitions. \\"What the author refers to variously as fixed figures, fixed elements, ostinati, and pattern units -- all musical motives that repeat -- leap to the foreground of almost every analysis in this book,\\" Ruth Longobardi wrote in Current Musicology, \\"and yet Albright never explicitly explains how to tell the difference between repeating motives that are dissonant and those that are consonant, or between those that are mimetic and those that are abstract.\\" Nevertheless, she writes, \\"his inquiry into different types of artistic collaboration is extremely valuable to musicology, since what it offers that field, frequently insulated from other disciplines, is a new path by which to enter an interdisciplinary consideration of Modernist music dramas.\\" In Kurt Weill Newsletter, David Drew wrote: \\"Albright well understands that 'paying attention to the text' is a discipline whose exactions are multiplied in proportion to the complexity of the interdisciplinary context. And yet: 'this book tries to please by holding up to the light the fugitive but powerful creatures born from particular unions of music and the other arts.' It does please; or when it doesn't, it stirs things up, which is just as good.\\" Several reviewers were intrigued by Albright's discussion of surrealism in music, and his identification of Francis Poulenc as a key figure. \\"Before the recent publication of ... Untwisting the Serpent,\\" writes Jonathan Kramer in his book Postmodern Music, Postmodern Listening (2016), \\"there was little serious discussion of surrealism in music (although informally calling certain music surreal is certainly common enough). Music has been assumed not to have gone through much of a surrealist stage.\\" Kramer admires Albright's cross- disciplinary consideration of surrealism in musical theater, but believes Untwisting is \\"most useful....is in [its] discussions of Poulenc‚Äôs specifically musical surrealism.\\" He quotes these words of Albright's from Untwisting: > I understand Poulenc‚Äôs manner of quotation -- and he was a music thief of > amazing flagrancy -- not as a technique for making pointed semantic > allusions, but as a technique for disabling the normal semantic procedures > of music. ‚Ä¶ Poulenc is a composer of surrealizing misquotations.Untwisting > the Serpent, page 287 Oliver Charles Edward Smith's essay on Poulenc in Cogent quotes liberally from Untwisting as a \\"comprehensive study of surrealism in music\\" (while noting that Theodor W. Adorno was the first to apply the \\"ism\\" musically). Both Smith and Kramer favorably cite Albright's explanation of the apparent (incongruous) conservatism of surrealism in music, compared to its wilder embodiments in the other arts, noting these passages from Untwisting [Kramer's ellipses]: > Surrealism is a phenomenon of semantic dislocation and fissure. It is > impossible to disorient unless some principle of orientation has been > established in the first place. ‚Ä¶ In other words, you can‚Äôt provide music > that means wrong unless you provide music that means something. ‚Ä¶ The > surrealism of Poulenc and his fellows didn‚Äôt try to create a new language of > music -- it simply tilted the semantic planes of the old language of music. > Just as surrealist paintings often have a horizon line and a highly > developed sense of perspective, in order that the falseness of the space and > the errors of scale among the painted entities can register their various > outrages to normal decorum, so surrealist music provides an intelligible > context of familiar sounds in order to develop a system of meanings that can > assault or discredit other systems of meanings.Untwisting the Serpent, pp. > 289-90 Multi-Disciplinarian Untwisting the Serpent limited its cross- disciplinary analysis to specific examples where musicians, artists, and writers collaborated. In Albright's 2014 book Panaesthetics: On the Unity and Diversity of the Arts, he \\"developed a more expansive and philosophical version of his arguments by ranging across the entire history of the arts,\\" according to Adam Parkes. In his last book, Putting Modernism Together (2016), Albright renewed his pursuit of specifically Modernist forms of aesthetic hybridity. But whereas Untwisting deliberately cut across what Albright called the \\"various isms that both organize and perplex the history of twentieth- century art,\\" the final book \\"confront[ed] those isms head-on, and recalibrate[d] the earlier account accordingly.\\" Positions held * Assistant Professor, University of Virginia, 1970‚Äì75 * Associate Professor, University of Virginia, 1975‚Äì81 * Professor, University of Virginia, 1981‚Äì87 * Visiting Professor, Universit√§t M√ºnchen, 1986‚Äì87 * Professor, University of Rochester, 1987-2003 * Richard L.

Edgar Allan Poe served as an editor for a time (see below). After his departure, White resumed editorial duties before he hired Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury USN as editor from 1840 to 1843. Upon White's death in 1843, Benjamin Blake Minor served as editor and publisher from August 1843 to October 1847. The loss of writing and subscriptions led to the journal's cancellation in June 1864.

The Southern Literary Messenger featured poems, fiction, nonfiction, translations, reviews, legal articles, and Virginia historical notes. Each issue carried the subtitle \\"Devoted to Every Department of Literature and the Fine Arts\\" or some variation of it. The periodical was published approximately monthly, and it initially had subscribed mostly readers in the North but it picked up readers in the South and writers over time as more Southerners wrote articles to be published, as was stated in an 1840 issue of the Messenger. James E. Heath, the first editor of the Southern Literary Messenger wrote: > From our Northern and Eastern friends we have received more complimentary > notices than from any of our Southern brethren without the limits of our own > State. We say this not in a reproachful spirit, but in a somewhat sad > conviction of mind, that we who live on the sunny side of Mason and Dixon's > line are not yet sufficiently inspired with a sense of importance of > maintaining our just rights, or rather our proper representation in the > Republic of Letters. In February 1861, the Southern Literary Messenger defended the secession movement by publishing an article by William H. Holcombe, a doctor, entitled \\"The Alternative: A Separate Nationality, or the Africanization of the South.\\" Involvement of Poe Edgar Allan Poe was hired as a staff writer and critic in August 1835, possibly based on a recommendation to White from John Pendleton Kennedy. Just a month later, White fired Poe, allegedly for his drinking habits, but rehired him in October. By December, Poe was made editor of the journal. While working for the Messenger, Poe published 37 reviews of American and foreign books and periodicals, cementing his place as a premier critic in the United States.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. Checkmark Books, 2001. pp. 225-6. Poe was proud of his accomplishments with the journal and may have aided in a large jump in subscribers. In a letter years later, in 1844, Poe wrote that he began working when the Messenger had about 700 subscribers and left when it had 5,500 paying subscribers. Besides criticism, Poe published many first printings of his now famous works in the Messenger, including the controversial \\"Berenice\\", \\"Morella\\" and, in installments, parts of his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Poe left the magazine with the January 1837 issue but still contributed works even after White's death. See also December, 1835, Southern Literary Messenger, featured \\"MS.

Earlier versions were somewhat like a madrigal but lighter in style‚Äîbut by the 18th century, especially as it moved outside of Italy, the term came to mean a song for voice and accompaniment, usually in a light secular style.  Origins in Italy  In its earliest form, the canzonetta was closely related to a popular Neapolitan form, the villanella. The songs were always secular, and generally involved pastoral, irreverent, or erotic subjects. The rhyme and stanza schemes of the poems varied but always included a final \\"punch line.\\" Typically the early canzonetta was for three unaccompanied voices, moved quickly, and shunned contrapuntal complexity, though it often involved animated cross-rhythms. It was fun to sing, hugely popular, and quickly caught on throughout Italy, paralleling the madrigal, with which it later began to interact. The earliest books of canzonettas were published by Giovanni Ferretti in 1567 and Girolamo Conversi in 1572. By the 1580s some of the major composers of secular music in Italy were writing canzonettas, including Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi, who published his first set in 1584. Monteverdi was to return to the form with his ninth and final book of madrigals (published posthumously in 1651). Orazio Vecchi was another important composer of canzonettas in the 1580s. His canzonettas varied widely, and included some for dancing and some that parodied the excesses of the contemporary madrigal. Some composers, such as Roman School member Felice Anerio, adapted the form for a sacred purpose. Anerio wrote a set of sacred canzonette. By the end of the century most canzonettas were for four to six voices, and had become more similar to the madrigal. Some composers who studied in Italy carried the canzonetta back to their home countries, such as Hans Leo Hassler, who brought the form to Germany.  England  When the madrigal was imported into England in the late 16th century, the term canzonetta went along with it, anglicized to canzonet. Many compositions of the English Madrigal School were entitled canzonets, and although Thomas Morley referred to it specifically as a lighter form of madrigal in his writings, canzonets in England are almost indistinguishable from madrigals: they are longer than Italian canzonettas, more complex, and more contrapuntal.  Later developments  During the 17th century, composers continued to produce canzonettas, but the form gradually changed from a madrigalian, a cappella genre to something more akin to a monody, or even a cantata. Eventually, the canzonetta became a type of song for solo voice and accompaniment. A late example of the form can be seen in the two sets of six by Joseph Haydn for voice and piano, on English texts (1794-5). Sometimes the term canzonetta is used by composers to denote a songlike instrumental piece. A famous example is the slow movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. A more modern example is the Canzonetta for Oboe and String Orchestra (1979/1981) by Samuel Barber. The term has also been applied since the 17th century to mean \\"little Canzona\\" and has been used by such composers as Dieterich Buxtehude to apply to smaller Canzona-type keyboard works (often, like the Canzona, in fugue form and style). A good example of this is the Canzonetta in A minor, BuxWV 225.  Representative composers  Composers of canzonettas include: * Claudio Monteverdi * Lodovico Grossi da Viadana * Felice Anerio * Adriano Banchieri * Luca Marenzio * Pietro Cerone * Orazio Vecchi * Giovanni Artusi * Hans Leo Hassler * Giovanni Maria Nanino * Francesca Caccini * Salamone Rossi * Dieterich Buxtehude * Joseph Haydn  Popular Song  In 1871 George Cooper and J. R. Thomas wrote a Canzonet called \\"Dreaming, Still Dreaming\\" for Mrs. Zelda Sequin of the Parepa Opera Troupe.

Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, the film serves as a reboot for the fictional giant monster character Mothra, and is the first installment in the Rebirth of Mothra trilogy. It was the final kaiju film produced under the supervision of Tomoyuki Tanaka, who produced such films as the original Mothra, which was released in 1961, as well as every film in the Godzilla franchise up to this point. He died of a stroke several months after the film's release. Rebirth of Mothra stars Sayaka Yamaguchi, Megumi Kobayashi, Aki Hano, and Kazuki Futami. It was released theatrically in Japan on December 14, 1996, and was followed by Rebirth of Mothra II the following year. Plot Millions of years before time, a giant three-headed space dragon called Desghidorah arrives on Earth and battles a species of enormous and highly advanced moths. The moths are the protectors of the \\"Elias\\", a race of tiny, humanoid beings who inhabit the planet. After the ensuing battle, Desghidorah is defeated and sealed under the Earth. Only three Elias, Moll, Lora and Belvera, and one last moth, Mothra, remain. Moll and Lora are good- natured and benevolent, while Belvera has become vengeful and evil, eager to destroy the human race because she believes they will bring about the destruction of the Elias. To preserve her species, Mothra creates an egg in 1996; however, she becomes physically exhausted from the ordeal. Shortly thereafter, a logging company uncovers Desghidorah's subterranean prison and breaks the seal. Yuichi Goto, one of the workers, takes the seal home and gives it to his young daughter Wakaba as a souvenir. Seizing the advantage, Belvera controls Wakaba and uses her to torment her brother Taiki, reminding Belvera of her hatred towards her sisters. Moll and Lora, riding a smaller Mothra named Fairy, then battle Belvera for control of the artifact. Belvera prevails and manages to release Desghidorah from its rocky tomb to exact her warped plans for destruction of the human race. Mothra is summoned to halt the detestable dragon, which is absorbing the life out of the environment. She fights a long and difficult battle to repel her ancient adversary, and in response to her declining strength, her young son, named Mothra Leo, hatches prematurely to assist his mother. Though his energized silk seems to turn the tide of battle in the favor of the protectors, Desghidorah sinks the teeth of two of his heads deep into Leo and Mothra becomes desperate. She quickly airlifts her son to safety, and to keep Desghidorah at bay, lures the beast to a dam. With Desghidorah distracted by a wall of raging water, Mothra carries her son to safety. Mothra's wounds, age, and weariness are ultimately too much. Her strength fails, and after lowering her child carefully into the sea, she falls exhausted onto the waves and sinks to her death. The distraught larva attempts to save his beloved mother, but to no avail. Angered, the young moth creates a cocoon and began to change into his adult form. Desghidorah goes on a rampage, destroying everything in its path as the humans watch helplessly. Moll and Lora, who befriend Taiki and Wakaba, encourage them to have hope and remind them that Mothra would be reborn to save the Earth. Leo emerges into his adult form as a swarm of multi-colored butterflies. As the butterflies coalesce into one massive insect, Leo takes to the air and heads back towards Desghidorah, righteous fury burning in his wake. Arriving in a hail of energy beams, Leo relentlessly blasts the three-headed monster, throwing wave upon wave of searing beams and energy blasts at Desghidorah, who can only feebly attempt to defend himself against Mothra. Drawing upon an ancient legacy, Leo relentlessly assaults Desghidorah, eventually renewing the seal that bound the world destroyer beneath the soil of the earth; but his work is not done with the end of the fight. Drawing upon the power of life that filled his very being, Leo restores the balance to a blasted region that was deforested during the assault of Desghidorah. His work done for the time being, Leo travels to his ancestral home and planet Earth is once again safe from Desghidorah. Moll and Lora thank the children for helping them on their journey and return home to Infant Island with their pet Fairy, as Belvera, still vengeful, escapes into a hole in a tree.

Beginning in the mid-1950s, she and her brother, Larry Collins, performed as the Collins Kids. Early life Born in Creek County, Oklahoma, near Sapulpa, Collins and her brother Larry were individually musically talented as young children. Their parents relocated them to Southern California to further develop their music. They soon became paired as a musical duo. Career In the late 1950s, Collins was the girlfriend of television star and teen idol Ricky Nelson on both the Nelson family's top-rated show The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet and in private life. She made her debut on January 22, 1958 in an episode entitled \\"The Picture in Rick's Notebook\\" in which she played the dual role of twin sisters (one being David Nelson's girlfriend and the other Ricky's potential paramour). In this first episode, Nelson and Lorrie performed a duet of \\"Just Because\\", which had been one of the Collins Kids' signature songs (Lorrie played her own guitar and covered the name \\"Collins\\" on the neck with her left hand). A month later, her brother made a guest appearance on the show in an episode entitled \\"Who Is Betty?\\", which aired on February 19, 1958. In 1959, when Collins was 17, she married Stu Carnall, who was Johnny Cash's manager and twice her age. She continued acting and singing with Nelson on television and recording and touring with her brother until 1961 when she gave birth to her first child. The Collins duo continued to perform into the 1960s, appearing as regulars in the 1963 Canadian music series Star Route, and later made appearances on The Jackie Gleason Show and The Hollywood Palace as late as 1967. Many of their performances on Town Hall Party were released on DVD by Bear Family Records of Germany; a CD of their work on the show Rockin' on T.V. was released in 1993 on the Krazy Kat label in Europe. With her brother, Collins is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. She and her brother performed together again in 1992 and 1993, mostly at music festivals. Death Collins died on August 4, 2018 in Reno, Nevada from complications of a fall at the age of 76.

The title was used in the Byzantine Empire with varying functions, and remains in use in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Civil administration  The first known sakellarios was a certain Paul, a freedman appointed by Emperor Zeno (reigned 474‚Äì491). The sakellarios is hence usually assumed to have headed a sakellion (or sakella, sakelle), a term which appears in early Byzantine sources with the apparent sense of \\"treasury\\", more specifically of cash, as opposed to the vestiarion which was for goods. Despite the origin of the term, the sakellarioi of the early Byzantine period (5th‚Äì7th centuries) are not directly associated with financial matters. Rather they appear connected with the imperial bedchamber (koiton), bearing court titles such as spatharios or koubikoularios, while some holders of the office were entrusted with distinctly non-financial tasks: Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641) appointed the sakellarios Theodore Trithyrius to command against the Arabs, while another sakellarios conducted the examination of Maximos the Confessor under Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668). It is only in the early 8th century that sakellarioi are directly mentioned as treasurers. By the time of the Taktikon Uspensky of ca. 843, the sakellarios had become a general comptroller of the fiscal bureaux (the sekreta), with notaries reporting to him in each department. The actual head of the sakellion department from this period on became the chartoularios tou sakelliou. The post continues in evidence until at least 1196, although it may have for a time been subsumed into that of the megas logariastes under Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118). From the late 11th century, the prefix megas (\\"grand\\") was added to it.  Ecclesiastical administration  Imitating the practice of the imperial court, the Patriarchate of Constantinople had its own sakellion. Like his secular counterpart, the patriarchal sakellarios lost its function as treasurer by the late 11th century and took over the supervision of donations to and the administration of the monasteries of Constantinople. At the same time, it also acquired the prefix megas and replaced the megas skeuophylax as the second-most important official of the patriarchate. By the 13th century, the institution of megas sakellarios had been replicated in the provincial sees as well.

It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). It is well known for being the location of the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden, the IIEST Shibpur and the Hajar Hath Kali Temple. The famous Bengali linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji was born in Shibpur. During British Raj, its name was written as Seebpore. Recently, parts of administrative headquarters of the West Bengal government have been temporarily shifted to Mandirtala (Nabanna) in Shibpur. Shibpur is under the jurisdiction of Howrah Police Station, Shibpur Police Station, Chatterjeehat Police Station, B. Garden Police Station and Santragachi Police Station of Howrah City Police. History The Sanjher Attchala Estate The area was home to many royal landlords (zamindars) in Bengal. During the era of British rule in India, the landlords sold their possessions to build jute mills. These included the successful jute mills such as the Howrah Jute Mill and the Bengal Jute Mill. The proximity to Kolkata's southern district and the central business district which is just across the river brought many middle-class office goers to seek cheaper lodging in Shibpur. Some of the old zamindar house in Shibpur is like Roy Choudhury's. The family stayed in Shibpur for near about 500 years at Sanjher Attchala. Botanical Garden was a British determent area. Then after freedom, the Indian government took a long place from the garden and made the college. The oldest banyan tree is in the Shibpur B. Garden. Its original root has been destroyed many years ago and the tree sprayed a lot through its branches. This tree was taken from Africa by the British government. Char Mandir, Kazipara Batai Chandi Temple (considered an avatar of Goddess Kali) and Char Mandir are other notable places of Shibpur. Recent developments Before the Vidyasagar Setu project, a vast tract of land near used to be a marsh and was only dotted by few villages. This is in the distant past now after building the iconic bridge and the Kona expressway easily connecting the place with heart of Kolkata and the national highway and the industrial sector in Dasnagar. Notably, the Kolkata Port was connected to the rest of India easier than the other existing route through Howrah Bridge and Bally bridge which are famous for their congested rush hour traffic. As a result of that, the place has good attention recently all over again. The town saw an immediate rush for land after the proposal for the bridge. Now various important buildings of the district are located in the town, namely the water purifying plant at Padmapukur, the Dumurjala Indoor Stadium and a good number of women's hockey clubs. The first Garment Park of Eastern India, initiated by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) is coming up at the approach to Vidyasagar Setu.\\"Green Address for Garment Trade - Small-scale Sector Gets Manufacturing, Marketing and Distribution Hub.\\" N.p., n.d.

The hospital provides an aggregate of 41 services along with a cancer support cell, which aims to raise funds for cancer patients, physiotherapy, nutrition, preventive health checks, counselling, emergency services and trauma care. Shibpur is also geared towards luxury living with some big real estate projects like Ideal Grand, Clubtown Riverdale building up luxury apartments with plenty of open spaces and amenities of mini townships in old Tram Depot area and Shibpur market between G.T. Road and Foreshore Road. That place is currently occupied by dilapidated warehouses. Over the last ten years, Shibpur has developed into a popular residential community. Many multi-storied apartment complexes have been built (e.g. Shree Apartment - being one of the oldest, Vivek Vihar - the complex widely spread, Panchsheel Apartments) attracted by the location near the River Ganges, as well as by the easy connection to South Kolkata through the Vidyasagar Setu. Newly constructed roads have made access to the area very easy. Many parts have turned up as a transportation gateway to Kolkata. Heavyweight transportation businesses are also growing in the Shalimar area. Culture The Shibpur Public Library is one of the oldest libraries in Howrah The eminent novelist Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay lived in Baje Shibpur, alias Bajiye Shibpur, meaning the musicians Shibpur, north of Shibpur. The linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji was born in this place. Kisari Mohan Ganguli, the author of the first complete English translation of the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata (1883‚Äì1893), also lived in Shibpur. Shibpur is notorious for its narrow lanes and high density built uptown space. Shibpur has a chequered history in the field of culture. The residents of this place are well known for their interest in music, the arts and literature. Many luminaries of West Bengal in the fields of sports and athletics reside here. The only indoor stadium in Howrah, the Dumurjala Indoor Stadium, is located in the western fringe of Shibpur (Dumurjala) on Dr. Bholanath Chakraborty Sarani (Formerly Drainage Canal Road). The legacy of the late master sarod player Bahadur Hossain Khan is continued through the \\"Ustad Ayet Ali Khan Sangeet Niketon\\" (Ustad Ayet Ali Khan Memorial School of Music) - a music school in memory of his father Ayet Ali Khan - in Shibpur. Popular areas Avani Riverside Mall, Kazipara Being a largely populated city Shibpur has its share of areas and places that play the role of landmarks and \\"hangout\\" points, such as Mandirtala, the Shibpur entrance to the Vidyasagar Setu, a very popular jogging track and rendezvous point.

Directed by Alan Parker, it stars Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. Set in 1960s Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the film focuses on the friendship between two teenage boys, Birdy (Modine) and Al Columbato (Cage). The story is presented in flashbacks, with a frame narrative depicting their traumatic experiences upon serving in the Vietnam War. Parker initially turned down an opportunity to direct, believing that the complex book could not be successfully adapted for a feature film. The project resurfaced in 1982 when A&M; Films, a subsidiary of A&M; Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay. Upon reading the script, Parker returned as director, and the film continued development at Tri-Star Pictures. Principal photography began in May 1984 and concluded in August of that year. Filming took place on locations in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. The film is notable for being the first to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled camera system created by Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown. The score was composed by Peter Gabriel. Birdy opened in limited release on December 12, 1984. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing only $1.4 million against a budget of $12 million. The film received mostly positive reviews, and has an approval rating of 85% at Rotten Tomatoes. Birdy was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the Top Ten Films of 1984, and won the Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival. Plot In a 1960s working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a teenage boy nicknamed \\"Birdy\\" befriends his next-door neighbor Al Columbato, and relates to him his fascination with birds and their ability to fly. The two begin pursuing Birdy's hobby of catching pigeons and caging them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents' home. One night, they climb atop a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary. Birdy concedes to Al's wishes of pursuing another venture. After they purchase a 1953 Ford and restore it, Al's father registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an Atlantic City boardwalk, but they are arrested the next day after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that the car was not his to sell, and refuses a sum of money offered to him on principle. Birdy builds a new aviary in his bedroom and purchases two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses that he wants to die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood. Upon graduation, Al enlists and Birdy is drafted into the United States Army. During the Vietnam War, Birdy is placed in a mental hospital after being missing in action for a month. A flashback reveals that he was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility, his face heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an exploding bomb. Major Weiss, a military doctor, informs him that, although Birdy's injuries are relatively minor, he has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as dissociative behavior. Al suspects Birdy of feigning insanity to hide from the world, and expresses to him that he too wishes to hide due to his own injuries. Birdy unexpectedly responds by telling Al that he is \\"full of shit\\". Al alerts Weiss to Birdy's response, but when the doctor arrives, Birdy remains silent. Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside. After Weiss flees, two orderlies are sent in to subdue Al, who fights them off and takes Birdy to the roof of the hospital. Birdy rushes to the ledge, raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof as if he were about to fly. Al runs over to the ledge and finds Birdy on another level of the roof perfectly fine. Cast Cast taken from American Film Institute listing of Birdy. Production=Development Following publication of William Wharton's 1978 novel Birdy, Alan Parker received galley proofs of the book from his agent, who advised him that the novel was going to be optioned. Upon reading the novel, Parker discussed it with his colleague, producer Alan Marshall, before turning down the opportunity to direct a film adaptation. He explained, \\"So much of the story happened inside the boy's head, and the poetry of the book was literary. To make it cinematic - I didn't know if I could make the jump.\\" In September 1979, Orion Pictures optioned the novel for $150,000. In October 1982, A&M; Films, a newly established subsidiary of A&M; Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay. Kroopf and Behr made various changes from the novel, opting to focus primarily on the friendship between Birdy and Al Columbato. They also decided to set the story during the Vietnam War, as opposed to the novel, which is set during World War II. \\"We were in high school in the mid-1960s,\\" Behr explained, \\"so growing up then was our experience.\\" Structuring the film required Kroopf and Behr to create a nonlinear narrative, and manufacture much of its action and dialogue from Al's narrative in the novel. They spent one year trying to sell their script to various studios, without success. In 1983, Parker received the script from A&M; and, after reading it, signed on as director. He then discussed the adaptation with executives at Tri-Star Pictures. After the studio agreed to produce the film, Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with Kroopf and Behr to work on the script. Casting Parker and casting director Juliet Taylor held open casting calls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, New York City and Philadelphia. Matthew Modine originally auditioned for the role of Al Columbato, but Parker decided to cast him as Birdy, believing that the actor possessed an \\"introverted honest quality\\" that best suited the character. Modine said, \\"I was flabbergasted because I hadn't auditioned for Birdy. I had never imagined playing the part of Birdy. So, I had to really go through an extraordinary transformation in my mind of trying to bring this remarkable character to life. It was an incredible experience making the film.\\" Nicolas Cage was cast as Al Columbato. He reflected, \\"I was terrified of the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally.\\" For scenes in which Al's face is disfigured and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. \\"I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb,\\" he said. \\"It gave me a feeling of something I had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much.\\" Elizabeth Whitcraft had been working as a waitress in Philadelphia before she was cast as Rosanne, a teenage girl who makes out with Al. The film marked her feature film debut. Maude Winchester secured the role of Doris Robinson, a teenage girl who Birdy encounters, during auditions in San Francisco. Dolores Sage, also making her film debut, plays Birdy's mother. Danny Glover secured the role of Mr. Lincoln, a bird owner who befriends Birdy, but Parker had his scene removed from the final film, explaining that it \\"was rather misplaced within the framework of [the] story\\". FilmingPre-production= Parker originally planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations described in the novel. Upon arriving in Philadelphia, he and producer Alan Marshall set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. Location scouting began as Parker was holding casting calls in New York City. Location manager Rory Enke and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland visited run-down areas of Philadelphia, and offered suggestions to Parker on his weekend visits from New York. Parker made an arrangement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that permitted the British crew members to work alongside members of both the east and west coast union locals. He had to employ no less than four members of the two camera locals in order to allow his past collaboratorsdirector of photography Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and editor Gerry Hamblingto work on the film. =Principal photography= Filming was scheduled to start in December 1983, but was postponed for six months to accommodate Modine's shooting schedule for Mrs. Soffel (1984). Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California. Animal trainer Gary Gero employed the use of 80 different canaries for various scenes in the film, as well as pigeons, a hornbill, a cat, eighteen dogs and a seagull. A women's prison wing located in the Philadelphia House of Correction doubled for a scene set in an Atlantic City jail. A scene depicting Birdy and Al climbing an elevated railway was filmed at the 46th Street Station above the intersection of Farragut and Market Street in the Mill Creek neighborhood. The cast and crew then moved to Philadelphia City Hall, where Wilson Goode, the city's first African American mayor, visited the set and gave the production his blessing. After four weeks of filming in Philadelphia, the cast and crew moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a refinery building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang off the edge of the roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double. The production next filmed Birdy's flight on an ornithopter at the Newby Island landfill in Santa Clara County. The filming of the scene was considered to be a health concern among the cast and crew, due to the exposed garbage and smell of methane gas. The filmmakers originally planned to shoot Birdy landing in a reservoir thirty feet away from the landfill, but a test of the water had shown it to be hazardous. Parker said, \\"We experimented with a 100-foot wire hanging from a helicopter to allow us to 'fly' Birdy into a pond we'd constructed at the bottom of a hill of garbage.\\" The military hospital scenes were filmed at the Agnews Developmental Center, a psychiatric and medical care facility located in Santa Clara. A corner of the hospital was used to film scenes set in Birdy's bedroom. The production then moved to Stockton, California to depict a scene involving Al aboard a train. The Vietnam War sequences were filmed in Modesto, California, where the art department found difficulty in pinpointing filming locations, as the entire area was flooded. The use of helicopters during filming was the subject of frequent discussions with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), following an accident during the production of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983). The special effects department used fifteen 20-gallon drums of gasoline rigged with explosive charges to depict a napalm strike. A total of four cameras were used to film the explosions. Principal photography concluded in early August 1984. The film was the first to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer- controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown. =Cinematography= The film was the first to be partially shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung at the center of the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself as a bird flying, but they encountered difficulties, as the camera would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly, but the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly. Music Peter Gabriel, who scored the film. The score was written, co-produced and composed by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel, and marked his first work on a feature film. During post-production, Parker had been incorporating the percussive rhythms from Gabriel's solo albums into the film. He contacted the musician's manager David Geffen, who advised him that producing the soundtrack would be a slow process, as Gabriel was known for working at his own pace. While working on his fifth studio album So, Gabriel agreed to score Birdy after viewing a rough cut of the film. Recording sessions took place at the Ashcombe House in Somerset, England, from October to December 1984. Gabriel used tapes of previously recorded material from the past four years, which he and music producer Daniel Lanois remixed for select scenes in the film. The score \\"Close Up\\" originated from the song \\"Family Snapshot\\" (from Gabriel's third album), which was composed on a Yamaha CP-70 Electric Grand Piano. \\"The Heat\\", \\"Birdy's Flight\\", \\"Under Lock and Key\\" and \\"Powerhouse at the Foot of the Mountain\\" borrowed musical elements from the songs on his fourth album, which had been composed on a Fairlight CMI IIx, a music workstation with an embedded digital sampling synthesizer. The soundtrack album, entitled Birdy: Music from the Film, was released on March 18, 1985 by Geffen Records and Charisma Records. AllMusic's Tom Demalon awarded it four stars out of five, writing, \\"The fact that Birdy is all instrumentals means that listeners whose familiarity with Gabriel is limited to 'Sledgehammer' and 'In Your Eyes' will be largely disappointed. However, its meditative nature makes it fine, reflective listening for the more adventurous.\\" Release Tri-Star Pictures had planned to release the film using a platform technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run would generate strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A&M; Films prompted the studio to refocus the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy underperformed at the North American box office, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, against a budget of $12 million. Home media The film was released on VHS in mid-June 1985 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, and on DVD on February 15, 2000 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The DVD presents the film in optional fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen versions on both sides of the disc. Special features include the film's theatrical trailer, as well as trailers for other films starring Cage and directed by Parker, information on the cast and crew, and a booklet featuring production notes. Birdy was first released on the Blu-ray format in the United States on June 25, 2019. It was given a manufacture on demand release, with no extras other than the theatrical trailer.

Reception=Critical response Birdy received mostly positive reviews from mainstream film critics. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 27 reviews, and gave the film a score of 85%, with an average score of 7.4 out of 10. Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four stars out of four, writing, \\"Birdy ... tells a story so unlikely ... and yet a story so interesting it is impossible to put this movie out of my mind.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Parker has for the most part directed the film deftly and unobtrusively. Every so often, though, he introduces the kind of overstatement Birdy didn't need ... Fortunately, the heavy-handedness is in limited supply. Most of Birdy is enchanting.\\" Film critic Emanuel Levy called it \\"a powerfully dramatic chronicle of postwar trauma.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, felt that the film was \\"far better as an antiwar film than as a poetic tribute to flight\\". Pauline Kael of The New Yorker praised Modine and Cage's performance, but described that the film as being \\"morose and unrelieved\\". Variety wrote, \\"Belying the lightheartedness of its title, Birdy is a heavy adult drama about best friends and the after-effects of war, but it takes too long to live up to its ambitious premise.\\" Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film \\"takes a while to hook you into its story. This is one occasion we can afford the wait; Parker keeps us awake by repeatedly slapping us across the face visually.\\" Accolades Birdy received several awards and honors, with particular recognition for the film itself. The National Board of Review named it one of the Top Ten Films of 1984. Following its release, the film premiered at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, and on May 20, 1985, it won the Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury prize. In 1987, the film received an Audience Award at the Warsaw International Film Festival.

James Beverley, professor of Christian Thought and Ethics at the evangelical Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, says that Tolle's worldview \\"is at odds with central Christian convictions\\" and that \\"Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus\\". John Stackhouse, a professor of theology and culture at evangelical Regent College in Vancouver, says that he \\"gives a certain segment of the population exactly what they want: a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser, that is, established religions\\". Stackhouse has described him as one of several spiritual teachers who \\"purport to have investigated the world‚Äôs religions (quite a claim) and found them wanting, who routinely subject those religions to withering criticism, and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives\\". Conversely, Stafford Betty, teacher for Religious Studies at California State University, Bakersfield finds common ground between Tolle's worldview and that of Christian mystics.

It was backed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and its newspaper, the Deseret News. It opposed Utah's Liberal Party.  Beginnings  Daniel H. Wells was among the first officials to be elected under the People's Party The People's Party emerged in 1870 in response to the non-\\"Mormon\\" Liberal Party. In fact, the initial slate of candidates for the 1870 Salt Lake City election was approved on February 9 by citizens who had swarmed into the first meeting of Liberals in order to hijack and disrupt it. Daniel H. Wells, the incumbent mayor, easily won the first contested Salt Lake election 2301 to 321. Previously, political candidates ran without party affiliation, and Latter-day Saint candidates usually found themselves unopposed. With organized opposition to Latter-day Saint candidates, the Latter-day Saint leaders found having their own party expedient. Historian Ronald W. Walker states that the party's name was selected to combat the notion that Brigham Young, himself not an elected official since 1857, was a tyrant. The People's Party, as the name intentionally suggested, claimed to speak for the Latter-day Saints, vast majority of citizens, in Utah Territory.  History of success  With only a handful of defeats, the party was supported by an overwhelming majority in most elections. Championing women's suffrage, with the vote extended to women in the territory in 1870, helped the party emphasize its strength. Most non-Latter-day saints in the territory were men, often miners, and so the People's Party gained a distinct advantage. Throughout its history, People's Party candidates never lost a statewide election. Local elections were lost to the Liberals under dubious circumstances, such as with the \\"Tooele Republic,\\" and after harsh anti- polygamy legislation disqualified many Latter-day Saint voters in the 1880s before the 1890 Manifesto halted further Latter-day Saint plural marriages.  Dissolution  The party disbanded in June 1891 prior to elections for territorial legislature. Members joined the two national parties, with Latter- day Saint leaders striving to direct equal numbers toward each party. With Latter-day Saints Democrats and Republicans competing against Liberal candidates, the Deseret News characterized Liberals as a \\"bastard party\\". One political ad asked rhetorically \\"what is he who votes for a bastard ticket?\\" Nonetheless, Liberals captured one third of seats in the territorial legislature. Impetus for dissolving the party came from members of the national parties who believed the territory should follow national political lines before obtaining statehood. The Latter-day Saints Church could not favor either national party because the Latter-day Saints majority in the state would make the preferred party into a new de facto People's Party. Two years later Liberals, also eager for statehood, followed suit, and Utah became the 45th state in the Union on January 4, 1896. References *Walker, Ronald W. (1998).

King Kleagles are appointed as leaders of a region and have delegation to manage members and official affairs of that regions members. In the 2000s the role was modified, empowering King Kleagles in maintaining structural order and ensuring the safety and security of members. It was deemed necessary to adapt the role to including the safekeeping of data and online communications within the Ku Klux Klan as the significance of the internet and digital communications became targeted and was known to be intercepted by other groups and Government agencies. King Kleagles are provided the highest level of authority to ensure compliance, security and accountability of members and provide orders and instructions to Kleagles to carry out. There are approximately 10 King Kleagles in the southern United States.  Incentives and recruitment strategies  Kleagle members were typically paid by commission and received a portion of each new member's initiation fee, similar to multilevel marketing schemes in later years. KKK members were encouraged to recruit others by framing economic, political and social structural changes in favor of and in line with KKK goals. These goals promoted \\"100 percent Americanism\\" and benefits for white native-born Protestants. Informal ways Klansman recruited members included \\"with eligible co-workers and personal friends and try to enlist them\\".Goldberg, R. \\"The Ku Klux Klan in Madison, 1922‚Äì1927,\\" The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Vol. 58, No. 1 (Autumn, 1974), pp. 31‚Äì44, JSTOR, Wisconsin Historical Society,https://www.jstor.org/stable/4634926 Protestant teachers were also targeted for Klan membership.  Bloc recruitment  Particularly in the 1920s, the Klan used a technique referred to as bloc recruitment. This term was coined by sociologist Anthony Oberschall. Bloc recruitment refers to \\"the way in which social-movement organizers often recruit members and participants among groups of individuals already organized for some other purpose.\\" This strategy was advantageous to the Klan because it allowed them to recruit large groups of members from one source instead of being faced with the difficult task of recruiting individuals one by one. This strategy was also effective because it allowed the Klan to build upon the solidarity already in place from other organizations. The KKK usually targeted fraternal lodges and Protestant church members for bloc recruitment. Protestant ministers were offered free membership and powerful Chaplain status within the KKK. Recruitment also involved recruitment drives that toured the United States.Quarles, C. (1999)The Ku Klux Klan and Related American Racialist and Anti-Semitic Organizations: A History and an Analysis, McFarland and Company Inc. Publishing Members of organizations like churches and fraternal lodges, were easily accessible by Kleagles or Klan recruiters because they were already socially active in public issues through their involvement in these organizations. These recruitment efforts were very successful, as such Klan membership soared. A primary recruitment leader during the 1920s, Edward Young Clark, reported that the Klan had gained 48,000 members in just three months. Klan leaders took advantage of this success and used membership fees to finance large purchases such as the Klan Krest, a new home for Imperial Wizard Simmons (founder of the 2nd KKK).  Violence  In addition to recruitment drives and alliances with fraternal lodges and Protestant churches, the Klan also used controlled instances of violence to attract members. Violence was pronounced in areas of high KKK activity, intimidating opponents of the KKK and impressing future members. Violence was a method to demonstrate commitment to the Klan philosophy; however, its use was monitored closely by Klan Leaders to discourage government intervention and to \\"avoid a backlash from the general public that could damage recruiting efforts\\".  Charity work and recruitment  To off-set violent acts, the KKK participated in charitable activities. In 1922, the Klan \\"contributed $25 each to the Volunteers of America and to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an offer which Webster said proved that the Klan was not anti-black\\". The charitable activities demonstrated that the KKK was committed to the welfare of the nation and also \\"served as an effective public relations device by creating a more favorable opinion of the secret order and attracting new members\\".  Other recruitment factors  The allure of the \\"invisible empire\\" and its public anonymity were also appeals for potential Klansmen. In addition to the empowerment of membership in an empire that was secretive, Klansmen also enjoyed a kin-ship bond from membership. The activities and events Klan members were impressive to future recruits as they included family picnics and other social events that built solidarity. ;Kleagles * Edgar Ray Killen, a Mississippi Klansman long suspected of involvement in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner that were the subject of the movie Mississippi Burning (1988).

Sandal Castle is a ruined medieval castle in Sandal Magna, a suburb of the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England, overlooking the River Calder. It was the site of royal intrigue and the setting for a scene in one of William Shakespeare's plays. History=The Warennes William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (1081‚Äì1138) was granted the Sandal estates in 1107. The 2nd earl built the first Sandal Castle of timber. He supported Robert Curthose against Henry I and was banished from the kingdom for two years. Later he was given the Wakefield manor. William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (1119‚Äì1148) spent little of his time at Sandal, having taken crusading vows and joined the Second Crusade. He had one daughter, Isabel de Warenne (1137‚Äì1199), who married William of Blois, son of King Stephen, who became the 4th earl. He died in 1159 having no children. Isabel, his widow, next married Hamelin (1129‚Äì1202), the 5th earl. He was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and assumed the Warrene name on his marriage in 1164. Hamelin is thought to have built the early Norman stone fortifications at Conisbrough Castle and also begun to replace the wooden fortifications at Sandal with stone. William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey (1166‚Äì1240) married Maud Marshal in 1225. He was loyal to his cousin, King John and is one of the four nobles whose name appears in the Magna Carta for John. On King John's death in 1216 he supported Henry III. Maud de Warenne, William's widow, held the Wakefield Manor from 1240 until their son John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (1231‚Äì1304) came of age in 1252. John married Alice de Lusignan in 1247. In 1296 the 6th Earl was appointed warden for Scotland by Edward I and in 1299, the Earl and his royal master were triumphant over the Scots at the Battle of Falkirk. William de Warrene (1256‚Äì1286) was killed at a tournament in Croydon pre-deceasing his father. His son John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey (1286‚Äì1347) was born in the year of his death. John married Joan of Bar but lived adulterously with Maud de Nereford from a village near Castle Acre in Norfolk. In 1347, the 7th Earl died. His sons John and Thomas became Knights Hospitaller in the Holy Land, predeceasing their mother. The lands passed to Edward III. The Warennes had castles at Lewes in Sussex and Reigate in Surrey, Castle Acre Castle in Norfolk and Conisbrough in Yorkshire. The Dukes of York In 1347, Edward III granted Sandal to his fifth son Edmund of Langley who was six years old at the time. His elder brother John of Gaunt held Pontefract and Knaresborough Castles, Edmund was granted Wark Castle near Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, and in 1377 Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire which was to become his home, and for the next 75 years the family seems to have spent little time at Sandal, leaving it to the management of constables or stewards. In 1385 Edmund was made Duke of York as a reward for his support for his nephew, Richard II of England. He was succeeded by his son, also Edward who campaigned in Ireland and died at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Edward was succeeded by his nephew, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. The Battle of Wakefield Early in 1460, during the Wars of the Roses, Richard Plantagenet made a bid for the throne. He was initially not well-received, but an Act of Accord made in October 1460 recognised him as heir to the throne and named him Protector of the Realm. In December Richard went to Sandal Castle, either to consolidate his position or to counter Lancastrian dissent. He had an army of 3,000‚Äì8,000 men but on 30 December in the Battle of Wakefield, he was outnumbered and outmaneuvered by Queen Margaret's army, coming from nearby Pontefract. Richard suffered a crushing defeat and both he and his younger son Edmund, Earl of Rutland were killed (although only two months later Richard's eldest son Edward became king). Richard III The castle's last brush with royalty came in 1483 when Richard's eighth son (and twelfth child) Richard III chose it as a northern base and ordered some significant investments. This hope was short lived however as Richard was killed in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. After this the castle was maintained a little, but gradually declined, with the building of Wakefield Prison in the 1590s leaving it even less useful. The English Civil War During the English Civil War Sandal Castle was Royalist, although its neglected state left it out of the major conflicts. In 1645 however it was besieged at least three times by Parliamentarian troops. Butler recounts: :Having been assured that they would receive a safe passage to Welbeck House in north Nottinghamshire they surrendered the castle at 10 o'clock on 1 October 1645. The garrison was then 10 officers and 90 men with two of the men called \\"seniors\\" implying that they were professional soldiers rather than just non-commissioned officers. They also surrendered 100 muskets, 50 pikes, 20 halberds, 150 swords and two barrels of gunpowder: no pieces of artillery are mentioned. As a result of this capitulation only Bolton Castle in Wensleydale and Skipton Castle remained in Royalist hands in Yorkshire, but Sandal \\"was the most resolute of all the three northern garrisons\\" and its fall caused great rejoicing among the parliamentarian forces. By the end of this siege the castle was a ruin. The following year Parliament ordered that it be made untenable. The castle The motte at Sandal Castle. The castles built by William the Conqueror's followers were self-sufficient strongholds, some of which were tax-gathering points, some controlled the larger towns, river crossings or passes through hills. Two castles were built near Wakefield, one at Lowe Hill on the north bank of the Calder and Sandal on the south bank. The first castles were probably started and completed in the early 12th century by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey after he had been granted the manor of Wakefield by Henry I. Sandal and Lowe Hill were motte-and-bailey earthwork castles with wooden towers on the mound and baileys with timber palisades and deep ditches. Sandal is built on a natural sandstone ridge, the Oaks Rock. The motte was raised to with the deep moat surrounding it. Only Sandal survived and during the 13th century the keep, curtain wall and other buildings were rebuilt in stone probably started by either the sixth or seventh Earls Warenne. Timber motte and bailey castles were often converted into stone if they were in use for long periods; Sandal is a particularly good example of this. The stone keep was circular with four towers each four storeys high; two of them close together formed a gatehouse, and the east tower contained a well, deep. The double-walled keep would have had guardrooms, storerooms and servants' quarters on the ground floor, the main hall above and private apartments on the second floor. The tower rooms had garderobes, (lavatories) that discharged on the outer walls of the keep. The curtain wall was high with a wall walk along its length, it enclosed the bailey and crossed the moat twice to reach the keep. The barbican at Sandal was inside the bailey; it was a three-storey tower with a moat opposite two drum towers at the entrance to the keep all of which were constructed in the early 1270s. The barbican with its own gate and portcullis added an extra line of defence between the main entrance gate and the keep. Attackers entering the barbican had to make a right-angled turn to enter the keep which was protected by a drawbridge between the drum towers. A stairway from the barbican led to a sally port, a hidden entrance near the moat from which surprise attacks could be made. The bailey lay to the south-east of the keep with the main gatehouse on the north- east side. It was crescent shaped, about long and wide. Inside the bailey there was a deep well and two privy shafts, one of which is deep. The ruins The ruins were a source of stone for local building and became a place for locals to relax. They were depicted in the foreground of a drawing of Wakefield from the south by Samuel Buck in 1719 or 1722, and in 1753 an engraving was published of an Elizabethan survey drawing. The ruins were first excavated by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society in 1893. A more detailed project began in the summer of 1964 and was a partnership between Wakefield Corporation, Wakefield Historical Society and the University of Leeds. This project started as an experiment in adult education, but with the help of over a hundred local volunteers it grew into a complete and rigorous excavation that continued for nine years. Whilst excavating the bailey, archaeologists found remains of flint tools suggesting a Mesolithic encampment was there in about 5,000 BC. In 2003 a wooden walkway was provided to allow access to the summit of the motte without causing erosion subsequently closed as an unsafe access. A visitor centre was constructed about from the castle. There have been historical re-enactments and \\"living history\\" days, including commemoration of the Battle of Wakefield and the deaths of Richard Duke of York and his son Edmund. In February 2015 Wakefield Council announced that due to budget constraints they were considering plans to either close the visitor centre or reduce its opening hours. The centre has since closed The castle is a Scheduled Monument, which means it is a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade II* listed building. Literary and folk references Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 3 (Act 1, Scene 2) is set in Sandal Castle. It describes Richard's sons urging him to take the crown before news is brought of Margaret's approach. Act 1, scene 4 then depicts the death of Richard at the Queen's hands. This brief fictionalised account bears little resemblance to the history as we understand it today. The play is sometimes performed on the castle ruins.

In 1844, he was promoted to Captain. After the establishment of the Prussian Navy in 1849, he entered as an auxiliary officer, becoming a Kapit√§nleutnant (KL‚ÄîCaptain Lieutenant) in 1855 and a Korvettenkapit√§n (Corvette Captain) in 1859. From August to October 1858, he commanded the aviso . In 1861 he went to Berlin as the head of the Hydrographic Bureau in the Prussian War Ministry. In 1865, he became captain of the steam corvette , which was sent to the Mediterranean. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Henk was commander of the Prussian North Sea Fleet. Over the winter of 1866‚Äì1867, Henk commanded the steam frigate on a cruise to the Mediterranean, in company with the gunboat . Gazelle struck a merchant ship in Constantinople in February 1867; Henk had been asleep at the time of the collision and the investigation placed the blame for it on his executive officer, KL Johannes Weickhmann. The Admiralty recalled aGazelle in April due to the damage sustained in the accident.Sondhaus, p. 90 In 1867 was promoted to the rank of Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea). During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, he commanded the armored frigate , part of the North Sea squadron commanded by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann. The Prussian fleet sortied only twice to attack the French blockade fleet in the North Sea, in early August and 11 September 1870, but on both occasions the fleet failed to locate any French vessels. For much of the war, K√∂nig Wilhelm struggled with machinery problems that left her confined to port.Sondhaus, p. 95 After war's end became commander of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea naval station). In 1871, he was promoted to flag rank as Konteradmiraland was ordered to Berlin as Director of the Admiralty the following year, where he served as the deputy to Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Admiralty. Henk was chosen in large part to reduce the threat to the position of Stosch, a general of the Prussian Army with no naval experience. Henk was an officer of middle-class background, had initially served in the merchant marine before entering the navy, and though he had been exonerated by the investigation into the Gazelle collision, it nevertheless had damaged his reputation. Later in 1872, the idea for establishing a permanent \\"flying squadron\\" of cruising warships to respond to crises around the world was raised, but Henk rejected it on the grounds that it was excessively expensive; Stosch sided with Henk and the proposal came to nothing.Sondhaus, p. 119 For the majority of his tenure as Director of the Admiralty, Henk was restricted to technical matters after 1874 in a move by Stosch to further limit the challenge Henk might pose to him. As a result, he had authority only on matters of ship building, ordnance, and supply.Sondhaus, p. 105 He remained there until July 1879. During this time he was promoted further (1877) to Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral), and the following year was raised to the hereditary peerage. He retired in 1879 and was given a pension. Between 1890 and 1893, Henk served in the Reichstag as a member of the German Conservative Party, representing the electoral district of Ueckerm√ºnde-Wollin. He died in Berlin.

Gateways are distinct from routers or switches in that they communicate using more than one protocol to connect a bunch of networks and can operate at any of the seven layers of the open systems interconnection model (OSI). The term gateway can also loosely refer to a computer or computer program configured to perform the tasks of a gateway, such as a default gateway or router. Network gateway A network gateway provides interoperability between networks and contains devices, such as protocol translators, impedance matchers, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators. A network gateway requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between the networks using the gateway. Network gateways, known as protocol translation gateways or mapping gateways, can perform protocol conversions to connect networks with different network protocol technologies. For example, a network gateway connects an office or home intranet to the Internet. If an office or home computer user wants to load a web page, at least two network gateways are accessed‚Äîone to get from the office or home network to the Internet and one to get from the Internet to the computer that serves the web page. In enterprise networks, a network gateway usually also acts as a proxy server and a firewall. On Microsoft Windows, the Internet Connection Sharing feature allows a computer to act as a gateway by offering a connection between the Internet and an internal network. IP gate On an Internet Protocol (IP) network, IP packets with a destination outside a given subnet mask are sent to the network gateway. For example, if a private network has a base IPv4 address of 192.168.1.1 and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, then any data addressed to an IP address outside of 192.168.1.0 is sent to the network gateway. IPv6 networks work in a similar way. While forwarding an IP packet to another network, the gateway may perform network address translation. Internet-to-orbit gateway An Internet-to- orbit gateway (I2O) connects computers or devices on the Internet to computer systems orbiting Earth, such as satellites or manned spacecraft. Project HERMES, run by the Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency, was first to implement this kind of gateway on June 6, 2009. Project HERMES has a maximum coverage of 22,000 km and can transmit voice and data. The Global Educational Network for Satellite Operations (GENSO) is another type of I2O gateway. Cloud storage gateway A cloud storage gateway is a network appliance or server which translates cloud storage APIs such as SOAP or REST to block-based storage protocols such as iSCSI, Fiber Channel or file-based interfaces such as NFS or CIFS. Cloud storage gateways enable companies to integrate private cloud storage into applications without moving the applications into a public cloud, thereby simplifying data protection. IoT gateway An Internet of things (IoT) gateway provides the bridge between IoT devices in the field, the cloud, and user equipment such as smartphones. The IoT gateway provides a communication link between the field and the cloud, and may provide offline services and real-time control of devices in the field.Marvell Unveils Andromeda Box IoT Platform Made for Brillo Retrieved 13 Nov.2015Amazon Web Services Announces AWS IoT.

It is the sequel to Chaos and an ancestor of the popular X-COM series of games, also written by Julian Gollop. In Lords of Chaos each player controls a wizard who can cast various magic spells. The spells have various effects, for example summoning other creatures (which the player also controls), or damaging opposing creatures and wizards. The game can be played against a computer-controlled opponent or by up to four human players. Gameplay Before embarking on the game's levels, the player is asked to design a wizard. This is done by splitting experience points amongst mana, action points, stamina, constitution, combat, defense and magic resistance. Remaining experience points are spent on spells. Spells may be offensive in nature (Magic Bolt, Curse), potions (Speed Potion, Healing Potion), utility (Teleport, Magic Eye) or summoning (Goblin, Unicorn, etc.). These spells continue the theme from Chaos and include some of that game's more unusual elements (Gooey Blob, for example). After completing each scenario, the player may spend accumulated experience points to further improve their wizard. The aim of each level of the game is for a player's wizard to reach a portal which appears after a preset number of turns. To do this, the player's wizard and creatures move around a map composed of square tiles, each of which represents one of various terrain types (for example, forest or the wall of a building). During a player's turn, only the parts of the map which that player's wizard or creatures have previously seen are shown, thus leading to other human players having to look away from the screen during each turn to avoid learning information they \\"shouldn't\\" know. Points are awarded for a player's wizard reaching the portal, for holding items of treasure (for example, valuable gems) when the wizard reaches the portal, or for enemy creatures killed during the level. Each level ends when all wizards have reached the portal or been killed, or when the portal disappears after a fixed number of turns (in which case all the remaining wizards lose). During each turn, each creature has a fixed number of action points which it can use to accomplish actions, for example moving, fighting hand-to-hand or shooting ranged weapons. When a creature's action points are used up for the turn, it can take no further actions until all the players have had a turn. The game came shipped with three scenarios: \\"The Many Coloured Land\\" provided both indoor and outdoor environments; \\"Slayer's Dungeon\\" was a traditional monster- inhabited dungeon containing a powerful sword; and \\"Ragaril's Domain\\" was single-player only, set in a trap-filled palace. An expansion pack was also available if purchased directly from Mythos Games which contained two further scenarios: \\"Islands of Iris\\" and \\"Tombs of the Undead\\", the latter being single-player only. A demonstration scenario called \\"Escape From Zol\\" was released on the covers of Your Sinclair and Zero magazines. It was single- player only and very similar in style to \\"Ragaril's Domain\\" where the player had to escape from a trap-filled building. However, even if the player won, their wizard's experience could not be used in the other five scenarios. Release Lords of Chaos was released on both 8-bit and 16-bit platforms. The 8-bit versions (for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC) were released in April 1990, with the 16-bit versions (Atari ST and Commodore Amiga) following in August 1991. The prices were ¬£9.95 for the Spectrum/Commodore 64/Amstrad CPC tape, ¬£19.95 for the Atari ST disk and ¬£24.95 for the Commodore Amiga disk. An IBM PC version was scheduled for release but never emerged. Reception The Spectrum version of Lords of Chaos was reviewed in 1990 by Your Sinclair, awarding 90%, and by CRASH, awarding 80%. Both reviews highlighted the game's detailed, colourful graphics and the complexity and depth of the strategic gameplay. The game won the award for best adventure game of the year, as voted by the readers of Crash.http://www.crashonline.org.uk/87/awards.htm It was also voted number 21 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time.

The organisation was founded at a convention in Ernakulam in 1974. It included elements that had broken away from Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)).  Kerala, Vanguardism, and the CIC=Kerala, an Introduction The Center of Indian Communist (CIC) did not gain popularity within a vacuum, their platform manifested within the context of the greater population of Kerala, a district known for employing leftist values in their political decisions.Schoenfeld, Benjamin N. \\"Kerala in Crisis.\\" Pacific Affairs 32, no. 3 (1959): 235-48. In the elections of 1957, the people of Kerala gave the Communist Party of India thirty-five present of the vote, demonstrating strong communist values among the people.Ibid. 235 Vanguardism in Kerala and the CPI The Center of Indian Communist (CIC) distanced themselves from the Communist party of India (CPI) largely because they saw the peasantry as being the appropriate vehicle for revolution as opposed to the proletariat.Friedman, Edward. \\"Maoism and the Liberation of the Poor.\\" World Politics 39, no. 3 (1987): 408-28 This contrast is analogous to that of Maoism and Marxism, Mao focuses his literature on the peasantry while Marx stresses the importance of the proletariat.Gregor, A. James, and Maria Hsia Chang. \\"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective.\\" The Review of Politics 40, no. 3 (1978). 313. While both Revolutionary Vanguards utilize the ethos of class struggle as their main rhetorical strategy, the areas where they depart are consequential. The proletariat encompasses all of the working class, while the peasant is one who is under direct control of an individual, thus accentuating the dominance hierarchy on an interpersonal level.Roberts, B. R. \\"Peasants and Proletarians.\\" Annual Review of Sociology 16 (1990): 353-77 Naturally, a multi-varied equation would be necessary to plot the requisite conditions from which communist sympathies emerge, however, some political-scientist attribute communist acceptance in Kerala as being the result of a high population of agricultural workers and peasants.Zagoria, Donald S. \\"The Ecology of Peasant Communism in India.\\" The American Political Science Review 65, no. 1 This analysis is important when examining the Center of Indian Communist in contrast to the Communist Party of India. Demographic Kinship between Kerala and Mao's China The Center of Indian Communist (CIC) saw their propagation strategy as superior given the prominence of agricultural peasantry within the Keralan people. The (CIC) was a Maoist organization, one which developed under similar demographic conditions to that of Mao‚Äôs China.Roberts, B. R. \\"Peasants and Proletarians.\\" Annual Review of Sociology Maoism seemed like the perfect fit for the (CIC) because of the strong emphasis on what Mao described as the ‚Äúdeclassed intellectual elite‚Äù as the appropriate mechanism for revolution.Gregor, A. James, and Maria Hsia Chang. \\"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective.\\" The Review of Politics 40, no. 3 (1978): 318 Similar to Mao's description of China, the vast majority of the people in Kerala were very well educated, they enjoyed some of the highest literacy rates in all of India.Zagoria, Donald S. \\"The Ecology of Peasant Communism in India.\\" The American Political Science Review 65, no. 1 (1971): 145 Despite this, they also suffered from unemployment, and high levels of poverty.Schoenfeld, Benjamin N. \\"Kerala in Crisis.\\" Pacific Affairs, 236. As a result of the demographic Kinship shared with pre-revolutionary China, the Center of Indian Communist aimed to propagate a revolutionary Maoist political ideology to the people of Kerala. A Struggle for Traction: How Marxist Ideology Became the Primary Mediator of Revolutionary Discourse in India=Fundamentals of Marxism In his work, Karl Marx was deliberate in establishing the requisite industrial conditions under which his theory becomes applicable.Avineri, Shlomo. \\"Marx and Modernization.\\" The Review of Politics 31, no. 2 (1969): 172 These conditions included a normative class structure predicated on achievement, such as capitalism.Ibid 176 It also necessitated a high level of career mobility, a precursor for industrial development.Ibid 176 Marx cites that Western industrialized society often sees and increases in demand for a product without increasing production, thus leading to price inflation instead of industrial development.Ibid 177 Under this model goods become the tools of ostentation, the possession of land, technology, and even food become emblematic of economic achievement.Laski, Harold J. \\"Introduction to the Communist Manifesto.\\" Social Scientist 27, no. 1/4 (1999): 52 Marx argues that this system is only able to prevail under the lie of autonomy, an equation in which the only variable relative to fiscal success is the conscientiousness of the individual.Ibid 51 For Marx, a communist revolution of the people can only be achieved when the proletariat actualize the erroneous nature of this analysis, allowing the poor and middle class majority to rise up against the rich and powerful minority.Ibid 51 This model of revolution is widely applicable given the prominence of industrial workers throughout the world, and particularly within India.Nizami, Taufiq Ahmad. \\"Marxism and the Communist Party of India.\\" The Indian Journal of Political Science 29, no. 2 (1968): 113. British Imperialism, the Proletariat, and Massive Competition The broad appeal of Marxism in large part could explain why the Center of Indian Communist (CIC) were never able to create a substantial impact on a national scale.http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/INDIA_1977_E.PDF Their Maoist appeal to the peasantry and agricultural laborers was not as broad as the Marxist proletariat within the greater context of India.Kumar, Ashutosh. \\"Marx and Engles on India.\\" The Indian Journal of Political Science 53, no. 4 (1992): 499. Ashutosh Kumar cites British imperialism as being formative in the development of the Indian proletariat, potently serving as a catalyst for the uprising of Marxist political ideology throughout the country.Ibid 499 The British government obliged India to start producing goods for import such as cotton, wool, hemp, and indigo.Ibid 499 The strong and conscious proletariat left by the ashes of British imperialism almost universally lent support to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)).Nizami, Taufiq Ahmad. \\"Marxism and the Communist Party of India.\\" The Indian Journal of Political Science (1968): 110. As a result of their prominence on the national scale the (CPI(M)) was able to reach their influence to practically every corner of India including Kerala.M. Thomas Isaac. \\"Communist Movement in Kerala: In the Electoral Mirror.\\" Economic and Political Weekly 19, no. 5 (1984): 201 Given the demographic framework of Kerala juxtaposed with the Communist Center of India‚Äôs peasant tailored rhetoric, one could assume their local influence would be vast, however, British rule left India with a massive industrial proletariat, one that eventually precipitated the ideological dominance enjoyed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Emergency in India, and the Downfall of the Center of Indian Communist=Indira Gandhi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed The Center of Indian Communist (CIC) was able to exist peacefully up until what is now known as The Emergency took place in 1975. Indira Gandhi was the prime minister of India at the time, she recommended that president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a state of emergency caused by fear of growing communist sentiments.Schoenfeld, Benjamin N. \\"Emergency Rule in India.\\" Pacific Affairs 36, no. 3 (1963): 221-37. This effectively halted the democracy, suspending elections and imprisoning much of Ahmed‚Äôs political opposition.Ibid 221 Emergency rule also meant that any authority as high as the District Magistrate could detain any individual that they suspect as being hostile to the Indian government.Ibid 225 The proclamation of emergency also entailed widespread censorship of Indian news outlets and entertainment.Morris-Jones, W. H. \\"Whose Emergency ‚Äî India's or Indira's?\\" The World Today 31, no. 11 (1975): 451 During this period in India there was virtually no standard for individual freedoms from the government, not only would executive powers have free rein over the fate of the democracy, the public were not allowed to challenge their decisions in court.Schoenfeld, Benjamin N. \\"Emergency Rule in India.\\" (1963), 227 Article 352 Gandhi and Ahmed were able to change India‚Äôs political landscape within their legal bounds as a result of Article 352 of the Constitution of India.Ibid, 452 This article describes the process by with an emergency of national security is declared, a proclamation of emergency is to be used in order to protect Indian rule throughout their territory.‚ÄúThe Constitution of India‚Äù. Article 352, (1-9) Backlash Gandhi and Ahmed claimed that the emergence of various resistance movements across India were indicative of a threat to national security and eventually used article 352 as a means to eradicate dissenting thought.Frank, Andre Gunder. \\"Emergence of Permanent Emergency in India.\\" Economic and Political Weekly 12, no. 11 (1977): 463-75. However, many scholars argue that this was not a matter of national security, rather they cite high oil prices and deteriorating living conditions under Ahmed‚Äôs administration as being formative in changing India‚Äôs political landscape.Morris-Jones, W.H, (1975), 454. Naturally Ahmed grew fearful that he would lose his control over India, both Gandhi and Ahmed agreed that it would be beneficial to ban his political opponents, leaving himself as the only legal option for support.Ibid, 454 Indira Gandhi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed soured their reputation with much of the public considerably.Morris-Jones (1975), 460. On October 31, 1984 Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her own security team, afterward her son Rajiv Gandhi took over her position as prime minister.Bryjak, George J. \\"The Economics of Assassination: The Punjab Crisis and the Death of Indira Gandhi.\\" (1985): 32-34. These events came to pass well after the conclusion of the emergency in India, however, they demonstrate the level of political instability from witch the Communist Center of India emerged, eventually culminating in the assassination of their prime minister. The Downfall of the CIC Despite their best efforts to halt the spread of Communism across India, the very early stages of the emergency saw many resistance groups gain popularity as a result of growing fears surrounding the future of Indian democracy.Dash, Satya Prakash. ‚ÄúNaxal Movement and State Power‚Äù Sarup & Sons, 2006. 24 However, this growth was extremely short, Ahmed introduced the prohibition of several individual resistance groups throughout India, one of which was the CIC.Ibid 24. While this marked the end of the Center of Indian Communist it certainly did not stop the prominence of revolutionary discourse within the people of Kerala and the rest of India.Kozicki, Richard J. \\"The Demise of Indian Democracy.\\" Asian Affairs 2, no. 6 (1975), 355. The Center of Indian Communist and other analogous resistance groups are emblematic of the widespread inequality and government corruption that plagued India during the 70s.Zagoria, Donald S. \\"The Ecology of Peasant Communism in India.\\" The American Political Science Review (1971). 145 References Defunct communist parties in India Defunct Maoist organisations in India Banned communist parties Political parties established in 1974 1974 establishments in India Political parties disestablished in 1977 1977 disestablishments in India ","title":"Centre of Indian Communists"},{"id":"1338593","text":"Boynton Beach station is a Tri-Rail commuter rail station in Boynton Beach, Florida.

Early life Tom Keifer grew up in a musical family and began playing guitar at a young age. Keifer soon fell in love with the blues and was heavily influenced by this kind of music. Keifer joined his first rock band while in junior high school. He soon learned to play the electric guitar. The young musician struggled with drug and alcohol abuse in high school,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QQJ7ueD9fc and considered dropping out of school to pursue a music career. However, his mother Adrienne bribed her son to stay in school by promising him a Gibson Les Paul guitar upon graduation. Keifer graduated and received the coveted instrument. After graduating, Keifer played guitar in bands such as Saints in Hell, Telapath, and Diamonds. Early career Soon, Keifer conquered his addictions, and began to focus on a career as a musician. He had started writing original material. He also found financial support by walking race horses at tracks and delivering film to developing outlets. Keifer came closer to his dream of being a successful artist by forming the hard rock band Cinderella with good friend and bassist Eric Brittingham. Brittingham, who he met on Halloween night in 1980 in a bar bathroom, had also been in Saints in Hell. Despite being shy, Keifer took on the role of lead singer because they could not find anyone they liked to sing for the band. In articles, Keifer has said, \\"I don't feel comfortable when I'm up there singing and not playing guitar. I feel naked when it's just me and the microphone.\\" Discovery Cinderella was discovered initially by Gene Simmons of Kiss who unsuccessfully attempted to get the band signed.(2016 interview on the Pods & Sods podcast) It was then Jon Bon Jovi in 1985, at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that convinced his Mercury A&R; manager Derek Schulman to sign the band. Bon Jovi has been quoted as saying \\"I saw Tommy Keifer onstage delivering some pretty nifty, growling vocals. Then he whipped out this Les Paul and proceeded to lay into some astounding sounds. This guy struck me as a star right then and there.\\" Keifer and company experienced much success with their albums, Night Songs, Long Cold Winter, and Heartbreak Station. Keifer enjoyed the reputation of being a prolific songwriter with hits such as \\"Shake Me\\", '\\"Nobody's Fool\\", \\"Gypsy Road\\", \\"Don't Know What You Got\\", \\"Coming Home\\", \\"Shelter Me\\", and \\"Heartbreak Station\\". He also enjoyed spending time with his wife, Emily, whom he had married in 1987 after years of dating. She also designed the band's unique logo and often accompanied her husband on tour. Later years After the Heartbreak Station tour Keifer lost his voice. He underwent several operations to no avail. Eventually it was determined that he had paralysis of the left vocal cord. To make matters worse, his mother died of cancer. By 1994, Cinderella had managed to release their fourth album, Still Climbing, which received little attention. The band broke up in 1995. Keifer continued to undergo surgeries on his vocal cords. He also battled depression. He was forced to learn how to sing again because of the paralysis of his left cord, but he eventually began working on material for a solo album. He and Emily divorced, and he settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where he continued to work on his solo album. The album was put on hold after Cinderella reunited in 1997 and toured in 1998. They signed with Sony Music, but were dropped a few years later. They released a greatest hits album, Once upon a‚Ä¶ and a live album, Live at the Key Club. Cinderella toured the United States in 2000 and again in 2002. Keifer has a daily regimen, including warm- ups and exercises, that may last longer than some of his shows; however, Keifer feels that he has his condition \\"under control.\\" Touring Cinderella was the headliner of the 2005 Rock Never Stops Tour. Keifer and Cinderella completed their 20th anniversary tour with fellow rock veterans Poison in 2006, who were also celebrating twenty years in the music business. The tour was a rousing success and swiftly became one of the most successful tours of 2006, averaging about 12,000 people in attendance per night. Cinderella had planned to tour in 2008 with Warrant, Lynch Mob, and Lynam. Unfortunately the tour had to be postponed after Keifer's left vocal cord hemorrhaged again, thereby making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future. Keifer has recently worked with country artist Andy Griggs. He also appeared on an episode of Extreme Makeover, where he helped a fan write a song. Keifer has finished his solo album, which was released on April 30, 2013. As of May 2, 2013, Keifer has been touring his solo album The Way Life Goes, moving from California, to across the Midwest, culminating in Chicago. The tour also visited many countries, including Russia. On Sunday July 22, 2017 Keifer was an act featured in Loud-N-Lima's 3-Day Music Festival in Lima, Ohio f–µaturing many artists from the hair metal era's peak. Present-day The most recent news from Tom Keifer on an interview last November 23, 2009 with Metalzone said they have never really gone away. They've been kind of on a break because he injured his voice a few years back and has been trying to rehabilitate his vocal cords and train it back to where he can be able to perform a Cinderella show again. \\"I thought that I was there in the summer of 2008 for the tour for the States here, and we ended up having to cancel that tour because I re-injured my voice. Since then I've been working on trying to get it strong again, which I am glad to say it's very strong now and we're looking to be back out on the road in 2010.\\" When asked about his solo record, (as of April 2010) he said \\"It‚Äôs pretty much finished. I‚Äôm booking a mastering date, probably in May sometime, before we hit the road for the summer. Then I will be looking for a label for it\\". When asked about the possibility of a new Cinderella record, Tom said it is probable but the band would need to be all in for it, and the record label would need to be for it. In 2013, Keifer discussed the progress of his solo album, and was quoted saying the following: \\"The idea for a solo record started in the Nineties when the band parted ways and we left Universal,\\" said the frontman. \\"There was just a changing of the guard in the industry at that time and I started thinking about a solo record. I wrote for it for many years and the songs just kept going on the pile and I never got around to actually making a record... We started cutting tracks for this record in 2003 and I went to the pile of songs that had been building up and picked some that I liked and I've just been working on it ever since. It was produced independently of a label, because the idea from the beginning was to just work and record until I was happy with it. I wrote with a lot of different people ‚Äì my wife, Savannah, who's a great writer, co-wrote a lot of the songs on the record and also co- produced the record with me, and a good friend of ours, Chuck Turner, who's a great engineer and producer. So from the beginning, the attitude was, 'Let's have fun and just make a great record and it'll be done when it's done.' Little did we know it'd be nine years later... it's done and we went through some crazy stuff and mixed and remixed and reworked things over and over and probably made a lot of mistakes along the way, but finally got it where we were all happy with it, so here it is.\\" Personal life Keifer is married to singer-songwriter Savannah Snow. In February 2004, their first child, Jaidan, was born.

Bengtsson. The narrative is set in the late 10th century and follows the adventures of the Viking R√∂de Orm - called \\"Red\\" for his hair and his temper, a native of Scania. The book portrays the political situation of Europe in the later Viking Age, Andalusia under Almansur, Denmark under Harald Bluetooth, followed by the struggle between Eric the Victorious and Sven Forkbeard, Ireland under Brian Boru, England under Ethelred the Unready, and the Battle of Maldon, and then the Byzantine Empire and its Varangian Guard, Kievan Rus and its neighbors the Patzinaks - all before the backdrop of the gradual Christianization of Scandinavia, contrasting the pragmatic Norse pagan outlook with the exclusiveness of Islam and Christianity.The Paris Review The novel is divided into two parts, published in 1941 and 1945, with two books each. It used to be one of the most widely read books in Sweden. The first part was translated into English by Barrows Mussey as Red Orm in 1943, but later editions and newer translations by Michael Meyer use the title The Long Ships. The book has been translated into at least 23 languages. Characters=Main characters *Orm Tostesson: The son of a Scanian chieftain. *√Ösa: Orm's mother. The family matriarch. *Toke Grey-Gullsson (Toke Gr√•gullesson): An adventurer from Blekinge who joined Krok's company. He becomes the lifelong friend of Orm. *Father Willibald: A priest assigned as physician to King Harald's court. *Ylva Haraldsdotter: King Harald's daughter with an Obotrite slave-girl. Later Orm's wife. Secondary characters *Krok: The leader of the campaign to Spain. *Rapp: A Scandinavian galley slave. Later a retainer of Orm. *Gudmund: A landowner maintaining tense relations with Orm. *Olof Styrsson: An experienced chieftain from Finnveden. *Ludmilla Ormsdotter: Orm's restless daughter. Betrothed to Olof. Recurring characters *Solomon the Jew: A Sephardi silversmith rescued by Krok's company. *Lady Subaida: The young daughter of a Leonese margrave. This is the name given to her after she becomes a concubine of Almanzor. *The Erin Masters: Two jester brothers (Felimid and Ferdiad) from Ireland. *Rainald: A Lotharingian priest sent to Scandinavia to replace a priest held as a thrall. *Mirah: An Andalusian slave- girl at King Harald's court. Plot Orm and his Viking companions follow Almansur in his campaigns against the Christian kingdoms of the North. The first book covers the years 982 to 990. While still a youth, Orm is abducted by a Viking party led by Krok and they sail south. They fall captive to Andalusian Muslims and serve as galley slaves for more than two years, later becoming members of Almansur's bodyguard for four years, raiding Santiago de Compostela under his command. They return to Denmark to King Harald Bluetooth's court where Orm meets Ylva. Orm later returns to Scania with Rapp. Orm and Rapp join a Viking party raiding England again after a brief period of peace in that area following the reconquest of the Danelaw in the mid-10th century by King Edgar, Ethelred's father. Orm joins a party led by Thorkell the High in England and when he learns that Harald's daughter Ylva is staying in London, gets baptised and marries Ylva. They move to a neglected farm, his mother's inheritance in G√∂inge, northern Sk√•ne, near the border with Sm√•land. During the following years (992 to 995), Orm prospers, and Ylva gives birth to twin girls (Oddny and Ludmilla), a son, Harald, and later to another son (though possibly from Rainald), Svarth√∂fde (Blackhair in the Michael Meyer translation). Meanwhile, Orm also gets busy in converting the heathens in the district, with the help of Father Willibald. The year 1000 passes without Christ returning. In 1007, with Orm now forty-two, his brother Are returns from the east, bringing the news of a treasure (\\"Bulgar gold\\") he had hidden. Orm decides to travel to the Dnieper weirs in Kievan Rus for the gold, and together with Toke and the Finnveding chieftain Olof mans a ship. They recover the treasure and return home safely. But on their return they encounter an unexpected crisis at home - Rainald, the rather ridiculous failed German Christian missionary, had become a renegade, turned into a Pagan priest of the old Norse gods and the leader of a formidable band of robbers and outlaws, and causes great havoc before being finally overcome. Following this final crisis and from then on, Orm and Toke live in peace and plenty as good neighbours, and Svarth√∂fde Ormsson becomes a famous Viking, fighting for Canute the Great. The story ends with the statement that Orm and Toke in their old age \\"did never tire of telling of the years when they had rowed the Caliph's ship and served my lord Al-Mansur.\\" Writing process Frans G. Bengtsson in 1943 The Swedish writer Sven Stolpe reports that somebody asked author Frans G. Bengtsson \\"what intentions he had with The Long Ships\\", to which Bengtsson responded that he had no particular intentions. \\"I just wanted to write a story that people could enjoy reading, like The Three Musketeers or the Odyssey.\\" The research for the book was based largely on Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla and other old Icelandic literature, but also on medieval chronicles and contemporary research, and historic names, people and events were woven into the fiction. The language of the novel is modelled on the Icelandic sagas. Early in his career, Bengtsson had held a romantic view on the saga literature, promoting an elevated, almost sacral prose in translations, but when writing The Long Ships he instead made use of the saga's faculties for wisecracks and comic understatements. The main characters were written as likable anti-heroes, far from the romantic view of Vikings. Like the sagas, the book relies on verbs and nouns to drive the narrative, with only a minimum of adjectives and descriptive passages. In essays, Bengtsson expresses disgust with \\"psychological realism\\" in the literature of his day where the thoughts and feelings of the characters are discussed explicitly rather than indicated by actions and outward signs. In the Swedish original of The Longships, the grammar is deliberately slightly archaic. Joan Klein noted that \\"Within the 10th Century plot, the book's Viking protagonists never heard of Jews, and have a completely open mind about them - and when encountering a Jew who allies with the Vikings and leads them to treasure beyond their dreams, they are duly grateful (...). However, one can hardly overlook the fact that the book was actually written in a very specific part of the 20th Century - during the Second World War, a time when Nazi Germany was involved in a horrific persecution and massacre of Jews, while the Nazis claimed the Viking heritage for their monstrous version of German and Germanic Nationalism. Bengtsson in effect throws the Viking heritage back in the Nazis' face\\" Dr. Joan Klein, \\"A Distant Mirror - Historical Writing as a Method of Slyly Commenting on Contemporary Issues\\" in George Whitley-Smythe (ed.) \\"A Round-Up of Recent Essays in Twentieth Century Cultural Issues\\" Adaptations The 1964 British-Yugoslav film The Long Ships (starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier) very loosely based on the book, retaining little more than the title (of the English translation) and the Moorish settings. In the 1980s, there were plans for a large-scale Swedish screen adaptation. The film was supposed to be directed by Hans Alfredson and star Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Orm and Sverre Anker Ousdal as Toke. The project was cancelled for financial reasons, but Alfredson's script was reworked into radio theatre which was broadcast in 1990. A comic adaptation by Charlie Christensen was published in four volumes between 2000 and 2004. In 2011 the Swedish production company Fladen Film announced they had acquired the film rights for the book, and that an adaptation was under development. In May 2014, during the press conference of Swedish film company Film i V√§st at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Danish film producer Peter Aalb√¶k Jensen, from the Danish film company Zentropa, founded by Lars von Trier, said that he was going to produce an adaptation of the novel. Aalb√¶k said that he had Stellan Skarsg√•rd in mind as playing the old R√∂de Orm and his acting sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill and Valter playing R√∂de Orm at various stages in his life. This adaptation is planned to be split into two films and also as a TV-series in four parts. Hans Petter Moland from Norway will be directing. Stellan Skarsg√•rd has expressed interest in acting in the film if the script is good. Filming was expected to start in V√§stra G√∂taland in 2016, however Film i V√§st decided to end their collaboration with Aalb√¶k and the film project was cancelled. In 2017, the Royal Danish Theater made a screenplay based on The Long Ships, to be played not in the theater, but atop the recently built Moesg√•rd Museum. The play was held atop a giant constructed wooden stage resembling a crashed Viking ship with a dragon's head and was based on the second part of Bengtsson's book, after R√∏de Orm returns to Denmark with the bell. The play was directed by Henrik Szklany with Andreas Jebro playing R√∂de Orm (R√∏de Orm in Danish). In 2018 the show was brought to Ulvedalene in Dyrehaven park.

He was born in Callan, County Kilkenny, Ireland. O'Malley was a self-taught artist, having drawn and painted for pleasure from childhood. He worked as a bank offic√¨al until contracting tuberculosis in the 1940s. He began painting in earnest while convalescing and, though he did at first return to bank work, he continued to paint and in 1951 he began exhibiting his work.  Life and career  In 1955 O'Malley holidayed in St Ives, Cornwall, then an important center of abstract art, and home to the artists Peter Lanyon, Patrick Heron, and Bryan Wynter, who he met and worked with. He returned again in 1957 and in 1958 retired from the bank to paint full-time. Prompted by a mixture of frustration at the indifference shown in Ireland to his work, an attraction to the sense of freedom he felt among the artists in Cornwall, and an engagement with the attempt to represent natural forms current in their abstraction, he settled in St Ives in 1960. While he was strongly influenced by the St Ives artistic community, his relationship was one of engagement rather than direct participation. His painting never completely assimilated the rigour and formality of the British abstract painters; it retained a muscular extravagance which is central to his artistic identity. O'Malley explained: :\\"Not so much abstract as essence. I could not paint for the sake of the pigment of whatever, but I like abstract form in the painting which instills it with meaning and power. Abstraction does enable you to get under the surface, to get beyond appearance, and to express the mind. But abstraction for its own sake does not interest me.\\" Tony O'Malley adopted a sombre palette in the second half of the 1960s and many of his paintings are dedicated to the memory of his friend and mentor Peter Lanyon who was killed when the glider he was piloting crashed in 1964. In 1973 O'Malley married Jane Harris, and through the mid 70s they spent time in the Bahamas and in O'Malley's native Callan. During this period, his paintings became less sombre and the Bahamas paintings are extremely colourful and vibrant. In 1990 they moved back to Ireland. In 1993 Tony O'Malley was elected a Saoi of Aosd√°na. When he died in 2003 he was regarded as one of Ireland's leading painters.  Legacy  The Irish Museum of Modern Art displayed a major retrospective of his work in 2005. In 2010 under the guidance of Jane O'Malley the RHA established an artist's residency in the house where Tony O'Malley grew up in Callan, Co. Kilkenny. The studio residency is awarded to artists who work primarily in paint. Previous recipients of the Tony O'Malley Studio Residency Award include Magnhild Opd√∏l, Ciaran Murphy, Ramon Kassan, Mollie Douthit, David Quinn and Paraic Leahy.

It originally aired from September 6, 1975 to September 2, 1976. Reruns of the show aired from September 1976-December 1976 on The Krofft Supershow, and in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the \\"Krofft Superstars\\" package with six other Krofft series. Premise The Lost Saucer was about two friendly time-travelling androids from the year 2369 named Fi (Ruth Buzzi) and Fum (Jim Nabors) who land their flying saucer on present-day (1975) Earth. They good-naturedly invite a young boy named Jerry (Jarrod Johnson) and his babysitter Alice (Alice Playten) to check out the interior of their craft. As onlookers begin to gather though, the two androids become nervous about attracting attention and abruptly take off with Jerry and Alice. The flying saucer has the ability to travel through time, but the controls which allow the androids to specify an exact date were damaged, thus preventing the androids from returning Jerry and Alice to their rightful time and place. The series follows the foursome as the two androids (who bicker and argue incessantly with each other, neither seeming competent with the ship's controls) encounter various adventures while trying to get Jerry and Alice back home or return to their own home on planet ZR-3 where they hoped to make repairs with the help of their lookalike creators Doctor Locker (Nabors) and Professor Pringle (Buzzi dressed as her purse-wielding spinster character Gladys from Laugh-In). The adventures are usually set on Earth (or an Earth colony) either in the distant past or in the distant future hundreds (or even thousands) of years hence. Typically, episodes were blatant social commentaries dealing with extremes such as a world where names (and faces) were replaced with numbers, where machines were outlawed due to a global energy shortage, or a city where the population had grown lazy and obese because robots do all the physical work. Accompanying them on their adventures was a creature known as the Dorse (played by Larry Larsen) which was a half- dog, half-horse hybrid with the body of a large shaggy dog and the head of a small horse. There were 16 original episodes produced for the 1975‚Äì76 season. The first six episodes were later rerun in the first half of The Krofft Supershow's first season. Themes Each episode had a specific theme, usually a social or environmental one. \\"Fat Is Beautiful\\", for example, depicted a future in which people were grotesquely obese due to over- dependence on push-button conveniences, and leanness was in fact outlawed. In \\"Get a Dorse\\", two scientists kidnap the Dorse to use as a power source because the world's fuel supplies were finally used up.

Early Musical Career 1981 ‚Äì 1992 East comes from a thriving artistic community stretching between S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. May East's art, be it in film, video, installation or music, expressed a deep concern for Brazil's environment both in the major cities and the country's vast interior, specially the rainforests of the Amazon. As a musician, May East started her career as a singer in the band Gang 90 & Absurdettes in 1981. Their songs mixed new-wave with beatnik poetry and a female choir, inspired by the new-wave band The B-52s. Gang 90 is considered to be the predecessor of all Brazilian new-wave bands of the 80s. In 1982 she collaborated with the independent TVDO videoart group and in partnership with the producer Nelson Motta co-produced the TV program Mocidade Independente for TV Bandeirantes. In 1984 she released her first single, \\"Fire in the jungle/√çndio\\", in Brazil, The Netherlands and Japan with EMI. Fire in the Jungle became a soundtrack for the film Areias Escaldantes directed by the independent director Francisco de Paula. Some months later, her first album, Remota Batucada was launched. The music was an original brand of electronica, folk music, and new wave pop and was coined as \\"tribal ie-ie\\". East also released the albums Tabapora and Charites.

Powers The Board has power to: *Appoint the Director of the Department, *Acquire lands and waters in the Commonwealth, *Establish buildings, structures, dams, lakes, ponds, public landings, wharves, or docks, *Regulate or prohibit drilling, dredging or other operations on VDGIF property, *Conduct operations for the preservation and propagation of game birds, game animals, fish and other wildlife, *Introduce new species of game birds, game animals or fish to Virginia, *Publish and distribute educational matter pertaining to wildlife, *Collect user fees for admittance, parking, and hunting, *Delegate power to the Director of Game and Inland Fisheries, and *Regulate hunting, taking, capture, killing, possession, sale, purchase and transportation of wild birds, wild animals, and inland water fish. Rulemaking process The Board holds meetings every year to consider amendments to the Virginia Administrative Code. In even-numbered years, fish and aquatic regulations are reviewed. In odd numbered years, game and terrestrial nongame wildlife regulations are reviewed. Procedures for emergency situations had not yet been developed, as of 2004. Well-known regulations=Snakeheads A high-profile regulation issued by the Board is 4VAC15-30-40, which bans the importation of snakehead fish. Wild animals *4VAC15-30-10 bans possession of wild animals in Virginia. *4VAC15-20-50 defines a wild animal as \\"Any member of the animal kingdom, except domestic animals, including without limitation any native, naturalized, or nonnative (exotic) mammal, fish, bird, amphibian, reptile, mollusk, crustacean, arthropod or other invertebrate, and includes any hybrid of them, except as otherwise specified in regulations of the board, or part, product, egg, or offspring of them, or the dead body or parts of them.\\" The regulation then lists 26 domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses, etc.) which are exempt from the definition. Some Virginians, such as ferret and skunk enthusiasts, would like to see additional animals added to the list of allowed pets. References *29.1-102.

His father, Ramzi Beik Stino Hanna was the first Egyptian irrigation engineer to take over supervision duties for the entire Egyptian irrigation system under the British. At that time, Egypt was under British rule. His mother, Afefa Michael Gad, was the daughter of one of the most prominent Coptic landowners. Kamal was the eldest son. His five siblings were Moheb, Charles, George, Georgette and Madeline. Dr. Stino earned a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the University of California, Davis, and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. His field of study was plant cytogenetics. He worked for the USDA in Bathesda, Maryland, for one year as a post- doctorate internship. When he returned to Egypt, he joined the College of Agriculture, Cairo University, Department of Agronomy. He taught thousands of students that received their bachelor's degree from the College of Agriculture. He also developed a large graduate congregation of his students. More than 120 graduate students received their master's degree and more than 80 graduate students received their Ph.D.‚Äôs under his supervision. He published more than 160 scientific papers in reputable scientific journals. He also wrote 4 textbooks on vegetables. He developed more than 12 new varieties of sweet potato, yams, squash, watermelon, melon and eggplants. In 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt at this time, chose him to be the only Coptic Christian Minister (Secretary) of supply and trade in the Egyptian cabinet. He held this post for 14 years. He was also the Deputy Prime Minister for the last 6 years of his appointment. During his career, he developed several systems to help the Egyptian poor. He launched a program to sell food staples to the public at subsidized prices through government-owned stores. These stores are still in operation as of 2013. He also developed a system to offer ration cards to the poor. National Poultry Company His Excellency, Dr Kamal Ramzi Stino also initiated the development of the National Poultry Company that introduced the broilers for the first time in Egypt; the National Meat Company that tried to produce a larger buffalo veal in Egypt and the National Fishery Company that introduced raising fish commercially and that had the first high sea commercial fishing fleet in Egypt. In 1970 he was chosen to head the Center of Agriculture Research. In 1972, he was elected as the first Director General of the Arab Organization of Agriculture Development. Family His Excellency was married to Farida Hanem Shawki Shenouda and had his firstborn son, Farid, with her. When she died due to complications during delivery, he married her sister, Madeline, and had a son, Sherif, and a daughter, Maisie. In addition to being a prominent figure in Egyptian politics himself, Dr Stino's brother Moheb was also appointed as minister of tourism and aviation under Sadat. His other brother, Charles was vice-minister of industry and trade under Nasser.

The stadium has also hosted many England youth international matches, and one senior England friendly international match, against Croatia in 2003. It staged several other sporting events, including athletics meetings and international hockey matches, musical concerts and Christian events. The stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s, which increased the capacity from 22,600 to a current figure of 30,311, making it the largest-capacity football ground in East Anglia. Its four stands have since been converted to all-seater, following the recommendations of the Taylor Report. In October 2020, it was announced that Portman Road was going to be closed down at the end of the 2020/21 season due to structural concerns. The club announced that they are negotiating a ground-share agreement with Norwich City for the foreseeable future. Chairman Marcus Evans said this would likely be the case for ‚Äòa number of years‚Äô until money can be found to finance a new development in the club‚Äôs home town. History Ipswich played their early matches at Broomhill Park, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since. The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a pavilion, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there. The first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the \\"Chicken Run\\", was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906. This structure was sold in 1971 to the local speedway team, the Ipswich Witches, who installed it at Foxhall Stadium. In 1914, the ground was commandeered by the British Army for use as a training camp for the duration of the First World War. Control of Portman Road was not returned to the club until two years after the end of the war and significant work was required to repair damage to the ground caused by heavy machinery. The East of England Co-operative Stand, formerly known variously as the Pioneer Stand, the West Stand and the Britannia Stand, with turnstiles For a short period during the 1920s, Portman Road was host to a number of whippet races in an attempt to increase revenue, and in 1928 a small stand was built on the west side of the ground. The football club turned professional in 1936 and the cricket club were forced to move out, so work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern \\"Churchmans\\" end and 650 tip-up seats, bought from Arsenal, were installed. Portman Road was home to Ipswich Town's first Football League match on 27 August 1938, a 4‚Äì2 victory against Southend United in Division Three (South) witnessed by more than 19,000 spectators. The Supporters' Association funded a number of improvements at Portman Road; in 1952, concrete terracing replaced the wooden terraces at the cost of ¬£3,000 and another ¬£3,000 was used to re- terrace the North Stand in 1954, bringing the capacity of the ground to approximately 29,000. In 1957, the association raised ¬£30,500 towards the building of a new West Stand, increasing ground capacity to around 31,000. Floodlights were installed two years later; the result of ¬£15,000 raised by the association. The floodlights were switched on by club president Lady Blanche Cobbold for the first floodlit match at the ground, a friendly against Arsenal, in February 1960. Television cameras made their debut at Portman Road in 1962 as Anglia Television arrived for Match of the Week; Note that the reference says Match of the Week started in 1963; however according to Soccerbase , Ipswich's 3‚Äì2 loss to Wolves actually occurred in 1962. it was another six years before the BBC televised a match at the ground, Match of the Day visiting Portman Road for the first time in 1968 to witness Ipswich's league fixture against Birmingham City. Meanwhile, ground development continued with roofing enhancements to the North Stand and an increase in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council. Sir Bobby Robson Stand with club store The two-tier propped cantilever Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, providing 3,500 additional seats and increasing the capacity of the ground to approximately 37,000. Advertising appeared around the perimeter of the ground in the same year, while the following year saw the construction of the \\"Centre Spot\\" restaurant underneath the Portman Stand. Additional seating was added to the Portman Stand in 1974 and the ground saw its record attendance of 38,010 the following year in an FA Cup tie against Leeds United. Following success in the 1978 FA Cup, the club invested in 24 executive boxes in front of the Portman Stand and, as a result of the Safety of Sports Ground Act (1975), reduced the capacity in front by introducing seats, taking the overall capacity down to 34,600. Sir Alf Ramsey Stand Plastic seats replaced wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in the following year, the club announced a deal with electronics company Pioneer Corporation with the stand expanded at a cost of around ¬£1.3m, renamed as the Pioneer Stand and re-opened in 1983. However, the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players, and led to a decline in fortunes on the pitch. Safety barriers were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster and following the recommendations of the Taylor Report, the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all-seating. The Pioneer Stand was renamed as the Britannia Stand following a new sponsorship deal with the building society in 1999, and in the following year a statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way. Success for Ipswich Town in promotion to the Premier League in 2000 led to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending around ¬£22 million on redeveloping both the North and South stands. The complete renovation of the South Stand into a two-tier stand added 4,000 seats to the stadium. The subsequent demolition and reconstruction of a two-tier North Stand added a further 4,000 seats and brought the total capacity of the ground to more than 30,000. In 2001, local brewery Greene King took on the sponsorship of the updated South Stand and as such, the stand was renamed the Greene King stand until 2009, when the sponsorship deal ended and the name changed back to the original 'South Stand'. Following the death of former manager Bobby Robson in 2009, the club announced that the North Stand would be renamed as the Sir Bobby Robson Stand. The official unveiling took place at half time during the league match hosting Newcastle United, another of Robson's former clubs, on 26 September 2009. On 31 March 2012, the South Stand was renamed the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand in memory of Sir Alf Ramsey who guided Ipswich Town to the Old First Division title. The season was the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the old First Division title. On 10 July 2012, the Britannia Stand was renamed East of England Co-operative Stand following a sponsorship deal with the East of England Co-operative Society. Structure and facilities The pitch is surrounded by four all-seater stands, the Sir Bobby Robson Stand, the Cobbold Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co-operative Stand. All stands are covered and are multi-tiered. The Cobbold Stand was constructed in 1971, and originally known as the Portman Stand. With two tiers and a cantilever roof, it is used to accommodate away fans, with an allocation of up to 3,000 seats per game and for family seating. It also contains a number of executive boxes as well as regular seating for home fans. The Sir Alf Ramsey Stand is a two-tiered stand which has a match-day capacity of approximately 7,000. It also houses the \\"Sir Bobby Robson Suite\\" restaurant and \\"Legends Bar\\". The tunnel, from which the players emerge onto the pitch from their dressing rooms, is unusually located in the corner of the stadium between the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the East of England Co-operative Stand. The East of England Co-operative Stand, constructed in 1957, was updated to an all-seater stand in 1990 and currently has three tiers consisting of home fan seating and an additional family area. It also contains the directors' box, further executive boxes and the press area. Behind the stand is a full-size AstroTurf pitch which is often used on a casual basis by fans before home games. The Sir Bobby Robson Stand was completely rebuilt in 2001 and has a capacity of around 7,500. (subscription required to view full article) It is a two-tier cantilever stand which is divided into an adults-only lower tier \\"...traditionally for the 'hard core' Town fan...\\" and a mixed upper tier. Statue of Sir Alf Ramsey There are nine areas throughout the ground designated for disabled supporters, in the lower East of England Co-operative Stand, the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand and the Sir Bobby Robson Stand. These provide over 300 spaces to accommodate wheelchair users and ambulant disabled, together with their carers. The ground also provides 12 seats in the East of England Co- operative Stand for visually impaired spectators with commentary via individual radio headsets in each seat, provided by local radio station BBC Radio Suffolk. The former groundsman, Alan Ferguson, received a number of accolades, including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year, and the pitch was voted the best in the Championship for three consecutive seasons in 2003, 2004 and 2005. There are statues of Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson, both former Ipswich Town and England managers, outside the ground. Nearby Portman's Walk was renamed Sir Alf Ramsey Way in 1999. Other uses Statue of Sir Bobby Robson On 20 August 2003, Portman Road hosted its first and thus far only senior England fixture, a friendly against Croatia, the match finishing 3‚Äì1 to England in front of 28,700 spectators. The stadium has been used by England youth teams on a number of occasions, the first on 24 November 1971, saw the England U23 team draw 1‚Äì1 with Switzerland. England U21s drew in a UEFA European U21 Championship qualifying match there on 18 August 2006 against Moldova, in front of 13,556 spectators. During the years when Ipswich were members of the Amateur Football Alliance (AFA), Portman Road was a regular venue for showpiece matches, staging AFA Senior Cup Finals and matches against the Corinthians. It also hosted two AFA international representative matches in 1909 and 1910, with an England XI beating teams representing Bohemia (10‚Äì1) and France (20‚Äì0). In addition, a variety of other sports have been hosted at Portman Road, including athletics in 1927, an American football match in 1953, and several international hockey matches in the 1960s and 1970s. The stadium has also hosted several music concerts, including performances by Elton John, R.E.M., Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pink, Neil Diamond, Tina Turner, and Rod Stewart, among others. In March 2005, around 8,000 Christians attended a gathering at the stadium, the largest act of Christian worship in Suffolk, since American evangelist Billy Graham used Portman Road on part of his Mission England Tour in 1984. Records Average and highest attendances at the ground since Ipswich Town turned professional The highest attendance recorded at Portman Road is 38,010 for a match against Leeds United in the FA Cup sixth round on 8 March 1975. The record modern (all-seated) attendance is 30,152, set on 21 December 2003 against local rivals Norwich City in Football League Division One. The largest crowd for a non-competitive game at the ground was over 23,000 for Bobby Robson's testimonial where Ipswich, including George Best, played against an England XI. The highest seasonal average at the stadium since Ipswich turned professional was 26,431 in the 1976‚Äì77 season while Ipswich were playing in the First Division. The lowest average attendance at Portman Road was 8,741 in the club's inaugural league season, the 1936‚Äì37 season in Division Three (South). The highest total seasonal attendance was recorded during the 1980‚Äì81 season when the aggregate was more than 814,000 during a season in which Ipswich won the UEFA Cup Final and finished second in the First Division. Portman Road hosted Ipswich Town's first appearance in European football competition when they defeated Floriana of Malta 10‚Äì0, still a club record, in the European Cup in 1962. Since then, Ipswich Town remain undefeated at Portman Road in all European competitions, a total of 31 matches spanning 40 years, a record until it was surpassed by AZ Alkmaar in December 2007. AZ Alkmaar were defeated in the match after breaking the record total; this could allow the record to be regained by Ipswich Town should they qualify for Europe in the future and remain undefeated in their next two home games. Transport The stadium is approximately from Ipswich railway station, which lies on the Great Eastern Main Line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich. The stadium has parking nearby for supporters, and the streets around the ground are subject to a residents-only permit parking scheme, but there are several pay and display or park and ride car parks within a short distance of the ground.

Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is generative recursion which may lack a definite \\"direction\\" inherent in corecursion and recursion. Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as streams, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of finite steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-productive. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial. Corecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation, to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming, where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.  Examples  Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.  Factorial  A classic example of recursion is computing the factorial, which is defined recursively by 0! := 1 and n! := n √ó (n - 1)!. To recursively compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) itself with a different (\\"smaller\\" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the base case has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute fac(3), this recursively calls in turn fac(2), fac(1), fac(0) (\\"winding up\\" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with fac(0) = 1, and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame fac(3) that uses the result of fac(2) = 2 to calculate the final result as 3 √ó 2 = 3 √ó fac(2) =: fac(3) and finally return fac(3) = 6. In this example a function returns a single value. This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial corecursively, as an iterator, where one starts with the case of 1 =: 0!, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers 1, 2, 3... as in the above recursive definition with \\"time arrow\\" reversed, as it were, by reading it backwards as The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a stream of all factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both n and f (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as: :n, f = (0, 1) : (n + 1, f \\\\times (n+1)) or in Haskell, (\\\\\\\\(n,f) -> (n+1, f*(n+1))) \`iterate\` (0,1) meaning, \\"starting from n, f = 0, 1, on each step the next values are calculated as n+1, f \\\\times (n+1)\\". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the +1 emphasizes that the factorial values are being built up, going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, down to the base case, with a -1 decrement. The direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial n! values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index n in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed. There is a connection with denotational semantics, where the denotations of recursive programs is built up corecursively in this way. In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as: def factorial(n): if n  0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) This could then be called for example as \`factorial(5)\` to compute 5!. A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as: def factorials(): n, f = 0, 1 while True: yield f n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1) This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by: def n_factorials(k): n, f = 0, 1 while n <= k: yield f n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1) This could then be called to produce the factorials up to 5! via: for f in n_factorials(5): print(f) If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function, def nth_factorial(k): n, f = 0, 1 while n < k: n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1) yield f As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting \`return\` for the only \`yield\` there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion, unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.  Fibonacci sequence  In the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as: :a, b = (0, 1) : (b, a+b) Because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the (b, -) corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the (-, a+b) corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment): def fibonacci_sequence(): a, b = 0, 1 while True: yield a a, b = b, a + b In Haskell, map fst ( (\\\\\\\\(a,b) -> (b,a+b)) \`iterate\` (0,1) )  Tree traversal  Tree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion. Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure. If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal. Using recursion, a (post- order) depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) ‚Äì the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over. Using corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value, then breadth-first traversing the subtrees ‚Äì i.e., passing on the whole list of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) ‚Äì at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc. In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, n) was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of n!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically: :v, t = ([], [FullTree]) : (RootValues(v, t), ChildTrees(t)) meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, concatMap fst ( (\\\\\\\\(v, t) -> (rootValues v t, childTrees t)) \`iterate\` ([], fullTree) ) These can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a leaf node (at the bottom) as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and analyzes a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes ‚Äì actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off below). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a root node (at the top) as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being synthesized of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step ‚Äì the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off above). In the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines. Notably, given an infinite tree, the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures. In Python, this can be implemented as follows. The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as: def df(node): if node is not None: df(node.left) df(node.right) print(node.value) This can then be called by \`df(t)\` to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order. The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as: def bf(tree): tree_list = [tree] while tree_list: new_tree_list = [] for tree in tree_list: if tree is not None: yield tree.value new_tree_list.append(tree.left) new_tree_list.append(tree.right) tree_list = new_tree_list This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order: for i in bf(t): print(i) Definition Initial data types can be defined as being the least fixpoint (up to isomorphism) of some type equation; the isomorphism is then given by an initial algebra. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the greatest fixpoint of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final coalgebra. If the domain of discourse is the category of sets and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, non-wellfounded values, whereas initial types do not.Barwise and Moss 1996.Moss and Danner 1997. On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of complete partial orders and continuous functions, which corresponds roughly to the Haskell programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.Smyth and Plotkin 1982. Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary recursion recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.Gibbons and Hutton 2005. The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell.Doets and van Eijck 2004. The examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is. Discussion The rule for primitive corecursion on codata is the dual to that for primitive recursion on data. Instead of descending on the argument by pattern-matching on its constructors (that were called up before, somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. \\"fields\\"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its \\"destructors\\" (or \\"observers\\", that will be called afterwards, somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion creates (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion analyses (necessarily finite) data. Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate. Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite. In \\"Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes\\"Leclerc and Paulin-Mohring, 1994 we find hd (conc a s) = a tl (conc a s) = s (sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s) else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s)) hd (primes s) = (hd s) tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s)) where primes \\"are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)\\". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as :p, s = (0, [2..]) : (hd(s), sieve(hd(s),tl(s))) or in Haskell, (\\\\\\\\(p, s@(h:t)) -> (h, sieve h t)) \`iterate\` (0, [2..]) The authors discuss how the definition of \`sieve\` is not guaranteed always to be productive, and could become stuck e.g. if called with \`[5,10..]\` as the initial stream. Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time: fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs) This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation; elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming. This can be done in Python as well:Hettinger 2009. from itertools import tee, chain, islice, imap def add(x, y): return x + y def fibonacci(): def deferred_output(): for i in output: yield i result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3) paired = imap(add, c1, islice(c2, 1, None)) output = chain([0, 1], paired) return result for i in islice(fibonacci(), 20): print(i) The definition of \`zipWith\` can be inlined, leading to this: fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs where next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t This example employs a self- referential data structure. Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential functions, but does not accommodate self-referential data. However, this is not essential to the Fibonacci example. It can be rewritten as follows: fibs = fibgen (0,1) fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) This employs only self- referential function to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with non-strict list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list. Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queueAllison 1989; Smith 2009. is a particularly good example of this phenomenon. The following definition produces a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree in linear time: data Tree a b = Leaf a  Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b) bftrav :: Tree a b -> [Tree a b] bftrav tree = queue where queue = tree : gen 1 queue gen 0 p = [] gen len (Leaf _ : s) = gen (len-1) s gen len (Branch _ l r : s) = l : r : gen (len+1) s This definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees. This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result (\`gen len p\` produces its output \`len\` notches after its input back-pointer, \`p\`, along the \`queue\`). It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling.Jones and Gibbons 1992. The function \`label\` visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion, and replaces each label with an integer, each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite. label :: Tree a b -> Tree Int Int label t = t‚Ä≤ where (t‚Ä≤, ns) = go t (1:ns) go :: Tree a b -> [Int] -> (Tree Int Int, [Int]) go (Leaf _ ) (n:ns) = (Leaf n , n+1 : ns ) go (Branch _ l r) (n:ns) = (Branch n l‚Ä≤ r‚Ä≤ , n+1 : ns‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) where (l‚Ä≤, ns‚Ä≤ ) = go l ns (r‚Ä≤, ns‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) = go r ns‚Ä≤ An apomorphism (such as an anamorphism, such as unfold) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a paramorphism (such as a catamorphism, such as fold) is a form of recursion. The Coq proof assistant supports corecursion and coinduction using the CoFixpoint command.  History  Corecursion, referred to as circular programming, dates at least to , who credits John Hughes and Philip Wadler; more general forms were developed in . The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

He was beatified in 1920 and canonised in 1975, thus becoming the first new Irish saint for almost seven hundred years. Biography Oliver Plunkett was born on 1 November 1625 (earlier biographers gave his date of birth as 1 November 1629, but 1625 has been the consensus since the 1930s)Earlier biographers gave his date of birth as 1 November four years later, but since the discovery of an ancient reference to Oliver Plunkett‚Äôs birth in the Bodleian Library, Ashmolean, MS.436 which stated: \\"He was born on 1st. November 1625\\" biographers of Plunkett since the 1930s agree on 1625. These include: Hanly, O‚ÄôFiaich, Forristal, Curtis, O'Higgins, Walsh, Bennett, Stokes, Concannon, Carty, Matthews, Murphy, Nowak, Burns, Meagher and the St. Oliver web-site. in Loughcrew, County Meath, Ireland, to well-to-do parents with Hiberno-Norman ancestors. A grandson of James Plunket, 8th Baron Killeen (died 1595), he was related by birth to a number of landed families, such as the recently ennobled Earls of Roscommon, as well as the long- established Earls of Fingall, Lords Louth, and Lords Dunsany. Until his sixteenth year, the boy's education was entrusted to his cousin Patrick Plunkett, Abbot of St Mary's, Dublin and brother of Luke Plunkett, the first Earl of Fingall, who later became successively Bishop of Ardagh and of Meath. As an aspirant to the priesthood he set out for Rome in 1647, under the care of Father Pierfrancesco Scarampi of the Roman Oratory. At this time the Irish Confederate Wars were raging in Ireland; these were essentially conflicts between native Irish Catholics, English and Irish Anglicans and Protestants. Scarampi was the Papal envoy to the Catholic movement known as the Confederation of Ireland. Many of Plunkett's relatives were involved in this organisation. Portrait of Oliver Plunkett He was admitted to the Irish College in Rome and proved to be an able pupil. He was ordained a priest in 1654, and deputed by the Irish bishops to act as their representative in Rome. Meanwhile, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649‚Äì53) had defeated the Catholic cause in Ireland; in the aftermath the public practice of Catholicism was banned and Catholic clergy were executed. As a result, it was impossible for Plunkett to return to Ireland for many years. He petitioned to remain in Rome and, in 1657, became a professor of theology. Throughout the period of the Commonwealth and the first years of Charles II's reign, he successfully pleaded the cause of the Irish Catholic Church, and also served as theological professor at the College of Propaganda Fide. At the Congregation of Propaganda Fide on 9 July 1669 he was appointed Archbishop of Armagh, the Irish primatial see, and was consecrated on 30 November at Ghent by the Bishop of Ghent, Eugeen-Albert, count d'Allamont. He eventually set foot on Irish soil again on 7 March 1670, as the English Restoration of 1660 had begun on a basis of toleration. The pallium was granted him in the Consistory of 28 July 1670. After arriving back in Ireland, he tackled drunkenness among the clergy, writing: \\"Let us remove this defect from an Irish priest, and he will be a saint\\". The Penal Laws had been relaxed in line with the Declaration of Breda in 1660 and he was able to establish a Jesuit College in Drogheda in 1670. A year later 150 students attended the college, no fewer than 40 of whom were Protestant, making this college the first integrated school in Ireland. His ministry was a successful one and he is said to have confirmed 48,000 Catholics over a 4-year period. The government in Dublin, especially under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Duke of Ormonde (the Protestant son of Catholic parents) extended a generous measure of toleration to the Catholic hierarchy until the mid-1670s. Popish Plot Titus Oates, perpetrator of the \\"Popish Plot\\" On the enactment of the Test Act in 1673, to which Plunkett would not agree for doctrinal reasons, the college was closed and demolished. Plunkett went into hiding, travelling only in disguise, and refused a government edict to register at a seaport to await passage into exile. For the next few years he was largely left in peace since the Dublin government, except when put under pressure from the English government in London, preferred to leave the Catholic bishops alone. In 1678 the so-called Popish Plot, concocted in England by clergyman Titus Oates, led to further anti- Catholic action. Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin was arrested, and Plunkett again went into hiding. The Privy Council of England, in Westminster, was told that Plunkett had plotted a French invasion. The moving spirit behind the campaign is said to have been Arthur Capell, the first Earl of Essex, who had been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1672-77 and hoped to resume the office by discrediting the Duke of Ormonde. However Essex was not normally a ruthless or unprincipled man, and his later plea for mercy suggests that he had never intended that Plunkett should actually die. Trial Despite being on the run and with a price on his head, Plunkett refused to leave his flock. At some point before his final incarceration, he took refuge in a church that once stood in the townland of Killartry, in the parish of Clogherhead in County Louth, seven miles outside Drogheda. He was arrested in Dublin in December 1679 and imprisoned in Dublin Castle, where he gave absolution to the dying Talbot. Plunkett was tried at Dundalk for conspiring against the state by allegedly plotting to bring 20,000 French soldiers into the country, and for levying a tax on his clergy to support 70,000 men for rebellion. Though this was unproven, some in government circles were worried about the possibility that a repetition of the Irish rebellion of 1641 was being planned and in any case this was a convenient excuse for proceeding against Plunkett. The Duke of Ormonde, aware that Lord Essex was using the crisis to undermine him, did not defend Plunkett in public. In private however he made clear his belief in Plunkett's innocence and his contempt for the informers against him: \\"silly drunken vagabonds... whom no schoolboy would trust to rob an orchard\\". Westminster Hall, where Plunkett was tried Plunkett did not object to facing an all-Protestant jury, but the trial soon collapsed as the prosecution witnesses were themselves wanted men and afraid to turn up in court. Lord Shaftesbury knew Plunkett would never be convicted in Ireland, irrespective of the jury's composition, and so had Plunkett moved to Newgate Prison in London in order to face trial at Westminster Hall. The first grand jury found no true bill, but he was not released. The second trial has generally been regarded as a serious miscarriage of justice; Plunkett was denied defending counsel (although Hugh Reily acted as his legal advisor) and time to assemble his defence witnesses, and he was also frustrated in his attempts to obtain the criminal records of those who were to give evidence against him. His servant James McKenna, and a relative, John Plunkett, had travelled back to Ireland and failed within the time available to bring back witnesses and evidence for the defence. During the trial, Archbishop Plunkett had disputed the right of the court to try him in England and he also drew attention to the criminal past of the witnesses, but to no avail. Lord Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton addressing these complaints said to Plunkett: \\"Look you, Mr. Plunket, it is in vain for you to talk and make this discourse here now...\\" and later on again: \\"Look you, Mr. Plunket, don't mis-spend your own time; for the more you trifle in these things, the less time you will have for your defence\\". The Scottish clergyman and future Bishop of Salisbury, Gilbert Burnet, an eyewitness to the Plot trials, had no doubt of the innocence of Plunkett, whom he praised as a wise and sober man who wished only to live peacefully and tend to his congregation.Gilbert Burnet History of his Own Time Everyman Abridgment 1991, p. 182. Writing in the 19th century, Lord Campbell said of the judge, Pemberton, that the trial was a disgrace to himself and his country. More recently the High Court judge Sir James Comyn called it a grave mistake: while Plunkett, by virtue of his office, was clearly guilty of \\"promoting the Catholic faith\\", and may possibly have had some dealings with the French, there was never the slightest evidence that he had conspired against the King's life. Execution Map of Tyburn gallows and immediate surroundings Archbishop Plunkett was found guilty of high treason in June 1681 \\"for promoting the Roman faith\\", and was condemned to death. In passing judgement, the Chief Justice said: \\"You have done as much as you could to dishonour God in this case; for the bottom of your treason was your setting up your false religion, than which there is not any thing more displeasing to God, or more pernicious to mankind in the world\\". The jury returned within fifteen minutes with a guilty verdict and Archbishop Plunkett replied: \\"Deo Gratias\\" (Latin for \\"Thanks be to God\\"). Numerous pleas for mercy were made but Charles II, although himself a reputed crypto-Catholic,England's Wars of Religion Revisited, p. 286, Glenn Burgess and Charles W A Prior, Ashgate, 2013 thought it too politically dangerous to spare Plunkett. The French ambassador to England, Paul Barillon, conveyed a plea for mercy from his king, Louis XIV. Charles told him frankly that he knew Plunkett to be innocent, but that the time was not right to take so bold a step as to pardon him. Lord Essex, apparently realising too late that his intrigues had led to the condemnation of an innocent man, made a similar plea for mercy. The King, normally the most self-controlled of men, turned on Essex in fury, saying: \\"his blood be on your head ‚Äì you could have saved him but would not, I would save him and dare not\\". Plunkett was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn on 1 July 1681 (11 July NS), aged 55, the last Catholic martyr to die in England. His body was initially buried in two tin boxes, next to five Jesuits who had died previously, in the courtyard of St Giles in the Fields church. The remains were exhumed in 1683 and moved to the Benedictine monastery at Lamspringe, near Hildesheim in Germany. The head was brought to Rome, and from there to Armagh, and eventually to Drogheda where since 29 June 1921 it has rested in Saint Peter's Church. Most of the body was brought to Downside Abbey, England, where the major part is located today, with some parts remaining at Lamspringe. Legacy St Oliver Plunkett's head Oliver Plunkett was beatified in 1920 and canonized in 1975, the first new Irish saint for almost seven hundred years, and the first of the Irish martyrs to be beatified. For the canonisation, the customary second miracle was waived. He has since been followed by 17 other Irish martyrs who were beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1992. Among them were Archbishop Dermot O'Hurley, Margaret Ball, and the Wexford Martyrs. In 1920 a mosaic of him at Westminster Cathedral, London, was created by Boris Anrep. As a spectacle alone, a rally and Mass for St Oliver Plunkett on London's Clapham Common was a remarkable triumph. The Common was virtually taken over for a celebration of the 300th anniversary of Plunkett's martyrdom. Cardinal Tom√°s √ì Fiaich, twenty enrobed bishops and a number of abbots mounted a stage beneath a scaffolding shelter on 1 July 1981. √ì Fiaich had flown there in a helicopter with Plunkett's head. The occasion attracted thousands of pilgrims to the park. In 1997 Plunkett was made a patron saint for peace and reconciliation in Ireland, adopted by the prayer group campaigning for peace in Ireland, \\"St. Oliver Plunkett for Peace and Reconciliation\\".

It was located in modern New York State across the lake from modern Vermont at the town of Crown Point, New York. The fort, whose construction began in 1734, was never attacked, and was destroyed in 1759 before the advance of a large (more than 10,000 man) British army under General Jeffery Amherst. The British constructed the much larger Fort Crown Point next to the ruins of Saint- Fr√©d√©ric; the new fort also never came under attack. Its small garrison was captured in 1775 in the early days of the American Revolutionary War, after which Fort Crown Point also fell into ruin. The fort sites at Crown Point were preserved in the Crown Point State Historic Site in 1910, and both ruins are National Historic Landmarks.  History  Construction was started in 1734 by Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry. When complete, Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric walls were twelve feet thick and four stories high, with cannons on each level. It was manned by hundreds of officers and troops, principally from Les Compagnies Franches de la Marine.p. 18, Folwell, Elizabeth, and Amy Godine, Adirondack Odysseys, The Adirondack Museum, Blue Mountain Lake, New York, 1997, The fort gave the French control of the frontier between New France and the British colonies to the south. As the only permanent stronghold in the area until the building of Fort Carillon at Ticonderoga starting in 1755, many French raids originated there and it was a target of British operations in the French and Indian War. Constructed on the tip of a strategic peninsula at a narrows in the lake, the cannons of Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric and the later British Fort Crown Point were capable of halting all north-south travel on the lake. In 1759 when British forces moved against Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric during the war, the retreating French destroyed it.p. 19, Folwell, Elizabeth, and Amy Godine, Adirondack Odysseys, The Adirondack Museum, Blue Mountain Lake, New York, 1997, The British Army and provincial militia then built Fort Crown Point, a vast fortification just southwest of the ruins of the French fort, starting in the fall of 1759. At the same time they built a fleet to gain military control of Lake Champlain and the 77-mile-long Crown Point Road across the Green Mountains to reach the Connecticut River. Today Since 1910 the remains of both forts on the Crown Point peninsula are part of the Crown Point State Historic Site. Both are also U.S. National Historic Landmarks.

It was published from 11 May 1990 until December 1998. History Maxwell founded the paper in the fervour which immediately followed the destruction of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Iron Curtain: the name was a reflection of the feelings of pan-European unity which were brought on by the historic changes, an ideal which Maxwell wholeheartedly supported. According to Time magazine, Maxwell originally envisaged a daily with a circulation of 650,000, but by the launch date plans had been cut down to a more realistic weekly with a circulation of 225,000.Time, 15 May 1990. In the event, the circulation peaked at 180,000, over half of which was British. Following Maxwell's death, the Barclay brothers bought the newspaper in 1992, investing an estimated $110 million and in 1996 transforming it into a high-end tabloid format oriented at the business community edited by Andrew Neil. In 1996, The European had a staff of 70 in London, 3 in Brussels, 1 in Paris, 1 in Berlin, 1 in Moscow, as well as a network of 100 freelance writers throughout Europe.

Opening narrationPlot Oliver Crangle is an insane fanatic who lives in an apartment with his parrot Pete. He maintains records of people he believes to be \\"evil\\" and has convinced himself that the so called \\"evil\\" people (communists, subversives, thieves, murderers) are engaged in a world wide conspiracy and have taken over Washington. He makes phone calls to them and their employers at all hours, writes letters regarding their actions, demands their prompt firing, and threatens to involve higher authorities if they do not comply. Unsatisfied with the results of his anonymous calls and letters, he searches for a more effective way to eliminate evil from the world; he settles on the idea of shrinking all evil people to two feet tall. Throughout the episode, Crangle's parrot Pete periodically calls out \\"nut,\\" asking for a nut to eat, which Crangle gives him, not realizing that Pete is unintentionally calling Crangle a \\"nut.\\" His landlady Mrs. Williams arrives, whom he berates and treats horribly to make her leave. Mrs. Lucas also comes to Crangle's apartment and pleads for Crangle to leave her husband, a doctor, alone. Crangle is convinced that because her husband was unable to save the life of a woman in the ER who died from her injuries, that he is a murderer and evil. Due to Crangle's letter writing to the hospital, her husband has started to feel extremely guilty for the woman's death, and Mrs. Lucas wants Crangle to stop. Crangle simply believes that those people are also evil. Mrs. Lucas leaves, realizing that Crangle is insane. Crangle calls a number of government agencies, and Agent Hall of the FBI is sent to investigate. Crangle tells him of his plan to shrink every evil person at 4:00 that afternoon through sheer force of will, mentioning his belief about a global conspiracy involving the evil people of the world. He also mentions that he has tried such feats before (trying to turn wheels into triangle shapes due to believing that evil uses public transportation to move). He believes that by shrinking all evil people to two feet tall, that they will be unable to carry on their everyday lives and eventually become extinct. Hall asks Crangle if he has ever had any psychiatric help and tells Crangle that they do not need his kind of help because they have the law. Hall says that both support and help in upholding the law are appreciated, but what Crangle is doing is instead interference. Crangle accuses him of being in on the conspiracy. As Hall leaves, Crangle screams at him that he too will be two feet tall in just 20 minutes. When 4:00 rolls around, Crangle is horrified to find that he himself has been shrunk to two feet tall. He struggles in vain to get up to his window sill, and one last time Pete calls out the word \\"nut\\". In the radio adaptation starring Stan Freberg, the ending was altered to be more gruesome as Pete the parrot mistakes the now-shrunken Crangle for a \\"nut\\".The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas Vol. 4, Blackstone Audio, Inc., Closing narrationReferences *Zicree, Marc Scott: The Twilight Zone Companion.

A peculiar galaxy is a galaxy of unusual size, shape, or composition. Between five and ten percent of known galaxies are categorized as peculiar. Astronomers have identified two types of peculiar galaxies: interacting galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN). When two galaxies come close to each other, their mutual gravitational forces can cause them to acquire highly irregular shapes. The terms 'peculiar galaxy' and 'interacting galaxy' have now become synonymous because the majority of peculiar galaxies attribute their forms to such gravitational forces.  Formation  Scientists hypothesize that many peculiar galaxies are formed by the collision of two or more galaxies. As such, peculiar galaxies tend to host more active galactic nuclei than normal galaxies, indicating that they contain supermassive black holes. Many peculiar galaxies experience starbursts, or episodes of rapid star formation, due to the galaxies merging. The periods of elevated star formation and the luminosity resulting from active galactic nuclei cause peculiar galaxies to be slightly bluer in color than other galaxies. Studying peculiar galaxies can offer insights on other types of galaxies by providing useful information on galactic formation and evolution. Arp mapped peculiar galaxies in his 1966 Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. Arp states that \\"the peculiarities of the galaxies pictured in this Atlas represent perturbations, deformations, and interactions which should enable us to analyze the nature of the real galaxies which we observe and which are too remote to experiment on directly.\\"  Notation  Peculiar galaxies are notated by an additional \\"p\\" or \\"pec\\" (depending on the exact convention) after the Hubble type of the galaxy.

Career  Thingn√¶s was introduced to music at eight years old, when he started to play in a Sinsen school band. His first instrument was the trumpet, but in 1953 he took up the instrument he would come to be known for: the trombone. Due to his success at a young age, he was able to continue his musical education at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, where he met other rising musicians. From 1959 onward, Thingn√¶s met and performed with the bands of Bj√∏rn Jacobsen, Gunnar Brostigen, Mikkel Flagstad and Kjell Karlsen. Starting in 1961, he led his own quartet, which over time included Egil Kapstad, Terje Rypdal, Laila Dalseth, Espen Rud, Bj√∏rn Alterhaug and Per Husby. However, it was the Frode Thingn√¶s Quintet (including Henryk Lysiak, Jan Erik Kongshaug, Pete Knutsen, and Thor Andreassen) that was included on Norway's first jazz album, released in 1963. In 1967 Thingn√¶s was named best trombonist in the magazine 'Jazznytt musician vote' and in 1969 he led a Norwegian sextet at the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival. Although Thingn√¶s is best known for his role in the jazz community, he also made major contributions to many areas in Norwegian music. In 1960, he took the prestigious role of kapellmeister at Norway's most famous revue theater, Chat Noir. While there, he collaborated with entertainers including Einar Schanke, Alfred N√¶ss and actor Yngvar Numme. He also worked with the rock band Popol Ace and conducted the Norwegian Radio Orchestra. Together with Philip Kruse, Thingn√¶s wrote the music for the Norwegian Eurovision Song Contest entries \\"Hvor er du?\\" (1974, English title \\"The First Day of Love\\") and \\"Mata Hari\\" (1976), both performed by his former wife, Anne-Karine Str√∏m. Both Thingn√¶s and Str√∏m were members of the jury-member \\"Finn Eriksen's Orchestra\\" at the time. Other pop music collaborations include Wenche Myhre, Lill Lindfors and Svante Thuresson, as well as production credits for, among others, Bodega Band (1977). In addition, Thingn√¶s worked as a conductor at two Oslo theaters, the Forsvarets staff music corps and, for over thirty years, the Kampen Janitsjarorkester. He composed for the Melodi Grand Prix in 1974 \\"Hvor er du?\\" and the 1976 \\"Mata Hari\\" (both times for Anne-Karine Str√∏m). His Fl√•klypaballetten for symphony orchestra was performed at the Norwegian Opera in 1985. In the same year, Thingn√¶s created his \\"Sonnets to Sundry Notes\\" of Music for symphony orchestra, big band and choir, based on texts by Shakespeare. His most renowned original works may be Wheels and the Fl√•klypa ballet (1985), performed at the Norwegian National Opera. In his latter years, he led a quintet together with Harald Gundhus.

It is the second largest town in Pskov Oblast; population: Velikiye Luki is a City of Military Glory, an honor bestowed on it because of the courage and heroism its citizens displayed during World War II. History The ramparts of the former Velikiye Luki fortress It was first mentioned in a chronicle under the year of 1166 as Luki. From the 12th century, Luki was a part of the Novgorod Republic. After the construction of a fortress in 1211, Velikiye Luki gained strategic importance, defending the approaches to Pskov and Novgorod. It was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow by Ivan the Great in 1478. During the Livonian War, it played an important role. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Velikiye Luki was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). It was explicitly mentioned as one of the towns the governorate comprised. In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off, and in 1772, Pskov Governorate (which between 1777 and 1796 existed as Pskov Viceroyalty) was established. After 1777, Velikiye Luki was the seat of Velikolutsky Uyezd (later known as Velikoluksky Uyezd). At the beginning of the 20th century, it evolved into an important railway hub following the construction of the railway connecting Moscow with Riga. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Velikoluksky District was established, with the administrative center in Velikiye Luki. Pskov Governorate was abolished as well, Velikiye Luki was the center of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On June 17, 1929, the okrug was transferred to Western Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished. On January 29, 1935, Western Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Velikiye Luki became the center of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 4, 1938, the okrug was abolished again. From 19 to 21 July 1941 and again from 25 August 1941 to 17 January 1943, Velikiye Luki was occupied by German troops. During World War II, in 1941 and 1942, fighting took place in the vicinity between German and Soviet forces. During the Battle for Velikiye Luki (in late 1942), a German force of about 20,000 was surrounded in the town which had been turned into a fortress. After months of heavy fighting, the German defenders were finally defeated in January 1943. The town was almost completely destroyed. Significant part of the Soviet forces fighting on Velikiye Luki consisted of Estonians mobilized to the Red Army, and approximately 6000 of them died liberating the town.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed from 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, George F. Nafziger Publishing, 1996. On July 25, 1942, 7th Estonian Rifle Division had a total of 12,676 personnel; by February 1, 1943, in spite of reinforcements, it had just 6,142 officers and men remaining. (page 6). 249th Estonian Rifle Division entered combat in late November, 1942, but despite reinforcements in December, on February 1, 1943, it had only 4,213 officers and men left, representing 50% casualties in less than two months. (page 97) Many streets are named after the heroes of the War. One such street is named after Yelizaveta Chaikina. On August 22, 1944, Velikiye Luki Oblast was established, with the administrative center in Velikiye Luki. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Velikiye Luki was transferred to Pskov Oblast as the town of oblast significance. 850th celebration In 2016, Velikiye Luki celebrated the 850th anniversary of the town's first appearance on historical sources, which is dated to 1166. The town marked the event with festivals and historical exhibitions, as well as making long-term improvements. In 2013, town planners began the preparations to improve the infrastructure and quality of life for residents. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev offered federal support to the anniversary, and recommended the Ministry of Transport fund a much-needed overpass connecting the two busiest parts of Velikiye Luki. The majority (70%) of the buildings in the town, including the schools, were built in the 1950s and 1960s and needed modernisation. New sports and leisure facilities were needed. Town officials stated the overall aim is to preserve the historical aspects of the city. Among the improvements planned was the remodel of a large obelisk in Jubilee Square, which was erected on the city's 800th anniversary in 1966 but never finished (and had been dubbed a \\"white elephant\\"). A contest was held to solicit designs for the remodel of the obelisk, as well as logos and slogans for the festivities. The winning design for the obelisk features elements symbolising the town's history, including Viking and Greek features. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it serves as the administrative center of Velikoluksky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #833-oz As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Velikiye Luki‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Velikiye Luki is incorporated as Velikiye Luki Urban Okrug and serves as the administrative center of Velikoluksky Municipal District.Law #419-oz Economy=Industry Velikiye Luki is an industrial city, with several enterprises in machine building industry. They produce machines for timber industry, electrotechnical equipment, and batteries. There is a workshop to repair railway carriages and locomotives. There are also enterprises of timber, textile, and food industries, as well as production of brickstones. Food industry in 2010 was responsible for production of 24.8% of all industrial output, and electrotechnical industry produced 15% of the output. Transportation Kalinin Square Velikiye Luki is an important railway hub. One railway connects Moscow via Velikiye Luki with Riga and runs in the east-west direction. Another railway, running to the northwest, connects Velikiye Luki via Toropets and Ostashkov with Bologoye. One more railway connects Velikiye Luki to Nevel, where it splits into two railway lines, both running southeast into Belarus: One line to Vitebsk, and another one to Grodno via Polotsk and Molodechno. The M9 highway which connects Moscow and Riga bypasses Velikiye Luki, which has an access to the highway. Other roads connect Velikiye Luki with Novosokolniki, with Nevel, and with Porkhov via Loknya. There are also local roads. The town is served by the Velikiye Luki Airport. Culture and recreation The district contains seven objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of federal significance and thirty-three monuments of local significance. The federal monuments include the Kazan Church built in the 19th century, and the ramparts, the oldest of which originate from the 12th century. The two museums in Velikiye Luki are the Velikiye Luki Local Museum, which exhibits collections of local interest, and Ivan Vinogradov Museum-House, located in the house which belonged to the parents of mathematician Ivan Vinogradov. The house was restored in the 1970s with the help of Vinogradov himself. He lived here before moving to study in Saint Petersburg. Sports Velikiye Luki is notable for ballooning competitions, which are held in the town annually since 1996. Since 1999, the competitions have been internationally recognized. ClimateNotable people Velikiye Luki has been claimed as the birthplace of Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. The Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Matrosov is buried in this city. Modest Mussorgsky's memorial house in Kunyinsky District, standing on the bank of a large picturesque lake, is within easy range of the town.

It is served by Amtrak passenger rail and Tri-Rail commuter rail service. It is located at 203-209 South Tamarind Avenue, south of First Street/Banyan Boulevard. History The station under operation by the Seaboard Airline Railway The station officially opened to passengers in January 1925 as a Seaboard Air Line Railway depot. The building was designed by the Palm Beach architectural firm of Harvey & Clarke. Among other Seaboard trains, the station was served by the Orange Blossom Special until 1953, and the Silver Meteor beginning in 1939. Amtrak maintained Silver Meteor service to the station when it took over intercity passenger train service in 1971. Both the Silver Meteor and Amtrak's Silver Star continue to use the station. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 19, 1973. Tri-Rail service to the station began in 1989. The City of West Palm Beach, following a purchase of the building in 1988, tapped local architecture firm Oliver Glidden & Partnershttp://www.keystonerestoration.com/Page%2015.htm to head a $4.3 million restoration of the structure. The project was completed and the station rededicated in a ceremony attended by the Florida Governor in April 1991. Architect Robert D. Brown directed the restoration of ornamental cast stone elements, exterior masonry, doors, windows, and iron and tile work. The red clay tile roof was replaced, as were the electrical, lighting, plumbing and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Abatement of lead and asbestos was further required to bring the historic structure up to modern building code standards. The restoration effort earned the Florida Trust Award for Historic Preservation in 1994. In summer 2012, the city finished an improvement project that included the installation of new sidewalks and more than five dozen trees around the building. The improvements were funded with a $750,000 Transportation Enhancement grant from the Federal Highway Administration, to which the city provided a $150,000 local match. Since the 1997 closure of the Palm Beach Airport station closer to Palm Beach International Airport, Tri-Rail passengers access the airport via taxi and PalmTran's fixed bus route 44. Station layout A northbound Tri-Rail train departing the station The station has two side platforms, with access to the station on both sides. West of the southbound platform is a long loop of bus bays serving Palm Tran routes. East of the northbound platform is the station house, a small parking lot, and bus stops for Greyhound Lines buses and Tri- Rail shuttles.

The underground bulb is 1‚Äì2 cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main stem grows to 30‚Äì120 cm tall, bearing 2‚Äì4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2‚Äì5 cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract. The leaves are slender hollow tubes, 15‚Äì60 cm long and 2‚Äì4 mm thick, waxy texture, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. The inflorescence is a tight umbel surrounded by a membranous bract in bud which withers when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a pinkish-green perianth long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers are several yellowish-brown bulbils. The fruit is a capsule but the seeds seldom set and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants. Plants with no flowers, only bulbils, are sometimes distinguished as the variety Allium vineale var. compactum, but this character is probably not taxonomically significant.  Uses and problems  While Allium vineale has been suggested as a substitute for garlic, there is some difference of opinion as to whether there is an unpleasant aftertaste compared to that of common garlic (Allium sativum). It imparts a garlic-like flavour and odour on dairy and beef products when grazed by livestock. It is considered a pestilential invasive weed in the USA, as grain products may become tainted with a garlic odour or flavour in the presence of aerial bulblets at the time of harvest.Eric Block, \\"Garlic and Other Alliums: The Lore and the Science\\" (Cambridge: Royal Society of Chemistry, 2010)James L.

Biography=Early life and education Covian was born in Rufino, Santa Fe Province, Argentina, on September 7, 1913. He studied at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires, where, while a student, he worked also as a teaching assistant in the Chair of Physiology. He graduated in 1942 and soon thereafter started a full-time career in research on Physiology, initially in collaboration with Bernardo Houssay, the great Argentine physiologist, who later was awarded with the 1947 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his investigations on the interaction between the hypophysis and the pancreas in the control of glucose metabolism. From 1945 to 1948, Covian worked at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine of Buenos Aires, a private research institution which Houssay and co-workers had founded in 1944, due to his dismissal from the University due to political persecution by the dictatorial regime of Juan Per√≥n. There, he worked also with another eminent physiologist, Eduardo Braun-Men√©ndez, and presented his doctoral dissertation in 1948. Fellowship After his doctorate Covian went for a post-doctoral fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation, at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, United States. There he worked on the physiology of hemidecorticated animals and neurovegetative control, with several important physiologists, such as Phillip Bard, Carl Richter and Vernon Mountcastle. He returned three years later to Argentina, to continue his participation at the Institute of Experimental Biology and Medicine, where, in 1952, he established the first experimental laboratory of neurophysiology of Argentina. Research In 1955 Covian was already well known internationally for his research on the neurophysiology of the limbic system. He accepted an invitation from Dr. Zeferino Vaz to join the faculty of the recently founded School of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto of the University of S√£o Paulo, at Ribeir√£o Preto, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, as the chairman of the Department of Physiology, a post he held until 1974 and from 1978 to 1982. Under Covian's able and humane leadership, the Department would grow to become one of the main excellence centers of research and education in Latin America, with an excellent scientific staff, with prominent researchers such as Eduardo Krieger, Renato Migliorini, C√©sar Timo-Iaria, Jos√© Antunes Rodrigues, Jos√© Ven√¢ncio Pereira Leite and fellow Argentines Maria Carmelo Lico, Andr√©s Negro- Vilar and Ricardo F. Marseillan. Covian was involved in all aspects of scientific and educational progress in the physiological sciences. It was there too that Covian founded the first Brazilian laboratory of neurophysiology. Leadership Covian was extremely active as a scientific leader. He was one of the founders and a president of the Brazilian Society of Physiology. He also was a strong force behind the graduate programs of the School of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto, and an innovator in the use of new approaches to the teaching of physiology. He was active in the editorial boards of several international scientific journals, such as \\"Physiology & Behavior\\" and the monograph series of \\"Progress in Brain Research\\", a member to several international committees, the International Brain Research Organization and the Latin American Federation of Physiological Sciences. Systematic study Covian's main achievement in neurophysiology was the systematic study, with a large group of collaborators, of the neural basis of thirst, of neuroendocrine regulation of hydroelectrolytic homeostasis, and of appetitive behavior, i.e., the behavior which permit animals to seek and to ingest particular foodstuffs or diet components, an activity which depends on many external and internal factors. The animal model used by Covian's group was the selective ingestion of water versus salt water in albino Norwegian rats, which they investigated with many approaches and tools, such as after lesions and stimulations of the central nervous system, measurement of metabolic activity, manipulation of the activity of the endocrine system, the effect of several kinds of drugs, etc. He also studied the role of the limbic system (particularly the septal area) on many behaviors and functions, such as the control of blood pressure, the neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive behavior, etc. Humanist Covian was also a humanist, deeply interested in the history and philosophy of science, history of medicine, epistemology, religion, classical music and erudite art. He retired at the mandatory age of 70, as a professor emeritus, but continued to appear regularly his office in the department Death Honored by his many colleagues, pupils and friends, Covian died on February 5, 1992, following complications of a stroke.

A fast-paced story, Up at the Villa incorporates elements of the crime and suspense novel.  Plot  The action takes place in the late 1930s. 30-year-old Mary Panton, whose extraordinary beauty has always been one of her greatest assets, has been a widow for one year. Her late husband Matthew, whom she married at 21 because she loved him, turned out to be an alcoholic, a gambler, a womaniser, and a wife-beater. Mary endures all the hardship and pain inflicted on her by her husband (including his having sex with her while drunk). When he drinks and drives, he has a car accident. A few hours later, he dies in Mary's arms. This, she concludes, is a blessing for both of them. The Leonards (a couple who are not in the novel) offer Panton their 16th- century villa on a hill above Florence, Italy, for an extended stay. She gladly accepts the offer. The old villa is staffed by Nina, the maid, and Ciro, her husband and manservant‚Äîbut it is otherwise empty. Mary, whose parents are both dead, enjoys the solitary life up at the villa. Occasionally, she joins other residents of, and visitors to, Florence for a party or luncheon. She enjoys driving round the countryside in her car. So far as a widow she has not taken a lover. She says it has been an easy decision as she has never been tempted. During dinner at a restaurant with some of her acquaintances‚Äîamong them the old Princess San Ferdinando, an American who is said to have been a \\"loose woman\\" in her day‚Äîthey listen to a young man playing the violin. He is dressed in folkloric clothes and does not play well. At the end of the evening, the Princess tries to set Mary up with Rowley Flint, a young Englishman of independent means and risky reputation, by asking her to give him a lift back to his hotel. Flint makes a pass at her, but she rejects him, and laughs, even when he proposes to her. After she has dropped him off, Mary drives back home. On her way, although it is late at night, she stops to have a look at the scenery. She senses someone nearby and learns that it is Karl Richter, the fiddler from the restaurant, who is also admiring the view. They begin to talk, and Mary learns that he is a 23-year-old Austrian art student who has fled his country because of Nazi persecution. Without a passport or documents, he is staying as an illegal immigrant in a rented room near the Leonards' villa. Mary takes pity on Richter, and invites him to look at the paintings in the villa. Learning he had gone without dinner, Mary fixes him some bacon and eggs. They have wine with their improvised meal. They end up in bed. When Mary thinks it is time for Richter to leave and the latter, to her dismay, asks when he will be able to see her again, the idyll quickly deteriorates. Mary remembers the revolver her suitor, 54-year-old Sir Edgar Swift, has forced upon her as a means of protection. When Richter starts threatening her, she pulls it out and aims it at him. She cannot pull the trigger and advises him to try and escape to Switzerland. After she tells him she slept with him from pity, Richter attacks her verbally. He picks her up and throws her on her bed, before covering her face with kisses. She tries to get away from him but he overpowers her. Seized with remorse over what he sees as the impossibility of life since escaping his homeland, Richter says, \\"You asked me not to forget you. I shall forget, but you won't.\\" He shoots himself through the breast with Swift's gun. The maid Nina hears the shot and comes to the bedroom door. Mary panics and sends her away. She phones Flint and asks him to help her. Mary is prepared to accept full responsibility for her actions. But Flint suggests they try to dispose of the body. They put the body in the car and drive out into the country, where he dumps it. A car full of drunk Italians approaches and must slow to try to pass. When the party see Mary and Flint embracing each other as they pretend to be lovers, they start singing \\"La donna √® mobile\\" and drive on. The next morning, Flint returns and leaves the revolver with Richter's body. Mary sleeps almost until noon. She has an invitation for luncheon, and Flint has urged her not to show any signs of panic or fear, so she attends it. Her guilty conscience is her constant companion. Sir Edgar Swift, who has known her and her parents since she was a little child, arrives, planning to renew his suit since she was widowed. He had told her of an impending promotion to a high government post in colonial India and his need for a suitable wife. He proposes to Mary before a short trip to Cannes on urgent government business. Mary tells him she will give him an answer when he returns. Mary confesses everything when Swift returns. He says that he forgives her and that he still wants to marry her. But, he says he must give up the promised post because of the risk of her past being exposed. He suggests that he can retire, they will marry and move to the French C√¥te d'Azur. Mary, finally says that she does not love him and could not be around him all the time. After Swift has left, Flint turns up at the villa. When he mentions owning an estate in Kenya, and having read Dr Johnson, he appears more attractive. Agreeing with him that life is about taking risks, Mary decides to accept his proposal. Film version The novella was adapted as the 2000 film Up at the Villa, directed by Philip Haas. The movie starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi, and Sean Penn. In the film, subplots were added to expand the material to feature film length, which reviewers and cinemagoers criticised.  Manuscript  Somerset Maugham donated the manuscript of Up at the Villa to Rupert Hart-Davis to sell in 1960 to raise money for the London Library; it sold for ¬£1,100.Hart-Davis, Rupert: Halfway to Heaven p55, Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1998.

The game features unauthorized appearances by Nintendo's mascot Mario and the rest of the cast of Super Mario Kart in a port of Street Fighter II. Kart Fighter has received some media attention, including mostly positive reviews, in part because of its perceived similarity to the later Super Smash Bros. series. Gameplay Yossy (Yoshi) fights a miniskirt-wearing Princess Peach. Kart Fighter follows many of the rules and conventions already established for the fighting game genre by the time of its release. The player engages opponents in one-on- one close quarter combat. The object of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. Because it is an adaptation of Street Fighter II, the game controls resemble those of the Street Fighter series. The player uses the D-pad to move the character towards or away from the opponent or to jump. The A and B buttons perform punches and kicks, as well as jump punches and jump kicks when combined with movement. Additionally, each character has a selection of special moves performed by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands. Unlike Street Fighter II, nearly all characters have some form of projectile attack available as a special move, but the blocking system is more limited. Five difficulty levels are available for solo play. A second player can also select a character, allowing for two-player matches. However, because no indication of this feature appears in game, it can be easily overlooked. Characters All eight playable characters from Super Mario Kart appear in Kart Fighter, although several have been renamed or are Japanese versions of names‚Äì Mari (Mario), Luigi, Peach (Princess Toadstool), Yossy (Yoshi), Kupa (Bowser), Donkey (Donkey Kong Jr.), Nokonoko (Koopa Troopa), and Kinopio (Toad). Many of the characters' appearances are closely adapted from Super Mario Kart sprites, although they are not to scale. However, Donkey Kong Jr. has a substantially different appearance and Princess Peach appears in a miniskirt and boots, similar to Chun-Li from the highly praised Street Fighter II. Development During the 1980s and 1990s, production of pirate Famicom games in East Asia was commonplace, aided by the Famicom's absence of the 10NES lockout chip included in North American versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System. The commercial success of Street Fighter II made it a particularly frequent choice for unauthorized ports and adaptations. Kart Fighter was one such game, developed by a team known as Hummer Team or Gouder, and published by Hong Kong-based Ge De Industry, probably in 1993. Kart Fighter used character models from the 1992 Super Famicom Super Mario Kart. The use of art from a 16-bit platform on the 8-bit Famicom presented technical challenges, because sprites on the less powerful console were limited to four colors. The Kart Fighter developers overcame this limitation by assembling the characters from several smaller sprites, which move together to give the appearance of a single object. Art resources from other games were also pirated, including a stage background taken from Little Nemo: The Dream Master. The same development team responsible for Kart Fighter also created other unauthorized Street Fighter II adaptations. One such game was included on the 1998 Super HIK 4 in 1 12M multicart, in which Mario appeared alongside characters from the Street Fighter franchise. The developers also modded Kart Fighter itself to produce the Sailor Moon-themed AV Bishoujo Senshi Girl Fighting. Legacy Several years after its release, Kart Fighter received critical attention for its similarities to the Super Smash Bros. series. Reviews were generally positive, especially in the context of fighting games on the NES or unauthorized NES games, categories viewed as having typically poor quality. Reviews cited its originality, music, and relative lack of bugs, with several considering it one of the best unauthorized games of its era, meeting or exceeding the quality of similar licensed games such as TMNT: Tournament Fighters. However, Complex considered Kart Fighter the worst fighting game ever made. Other reviewers remarked negatively on the screen flicker resulting from the game's sprite system, poor AI, missing menu options, and lack of a proper ending.

Early years Mislan (birth name: √Ångel Mislan Huertas) was born in San Sebasti√°n, Puerto Rico where he was raised and educated. The small town is located in the western part of Puerto Rico. His father was a music teacher who gave private lessons on the use of musical instruments. Mislan learned from his father how to play the clarinet and the euphonium (the latter is essential in the performance of Puerto Rican danzas). When he was very young he went to Spain to further his musical training by learning composition and harmony.La Danza Musical career In 1886, when Mislan was 24 years old, he returned to Puerto Rico and settled down in Arecibo. There he joined the Military Band of the Third Battalion of Volunteers; eventually, he became the director of that band. During this period he wrote his two best known danza compositions, \\"Sara\\" and \\"Tu y Yo\\" (You and I). His style differed from that of Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez and Juan Morel Campos in that his danzas were typically shorter and humorous. In 1898, Mislan returned to his hometown where he became the director of the Municipal Band. This was an important position, held in high regard by the society of the time. In 1906, he met a young musician by the name of Juan F. Acosta and took him under his wing. The older performer taught Acosta music composition and harmony and, when Mislan moved from San Sebastian to the town of Barceloneta, he recommended that Acosta replace him as the new director of the San Sebastian Municipal Band. Legacy Mislan died in the town of Barceloneta, Puerto Rico on February 1, 1911. Besides writing danzas, Mislan also wrote Puerto Rican folk music, waltzes and marches. Most of his works are safeguarded in the Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±a (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture). In 1948, Puerto Rican singer Julita Ross recorded the danzas of √Ångel Mislan. The City of San Sebasti√°n honored Mislan's memory by naming a school after him and by placing a bust of his image in the center of its plaza.

The line was constructed in 1859 by the Northern Railroad of New Jersey to connect the New York and Erie Rail Road's Piermont Branch terminus in Piermont, New York, to Erie's Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City. The line was then extended to Nyack, New York in 1870 and provided passenger service until 1966. Ownership of the line passed into the hands of Conrail upon the its formation in 1976. The line survives as two separate but connected sections. The Northern Running Track is an approximately two-mile- long freight railroad line in Hudson County, New Jersey. It runs from the Passaic and Harsimus Line at Marion Junction in western Jersey City via a short connection known as the Marion Running Track north to the North Bergen Yard and the CSX Transportation (CSX) Rivers Subdivision, At its southern end the running track provides a connection to Norfolk Southern Railway's Croxton Yard and junctions with the National Docks Secondary. North of the rail yard the Northern Branch (which was part of Conrail until 1998) diverges from the CSX River Subdivision and continues north to the New York state line as minor spur. The Northern Branch Corridor Project is New Jersey Transit proposal to restore passenger service on the line as an extension of the Hudson‚ÄìBergen Light Rail from the current Tonnelle Avenue terminus in North Bergen to Tenafly.  History = Northern Railroad of New Jersey  Passenger service shifted Exchange Place to Pavonia in 1860s and from Pavonia to Lackawanna in 1950s The Northern Railroad of New Jersey was chartered in 1854. When it opened on May 28, 1859, it was the second railroad in modern Bergen County (following only the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad) with stage connections to Hackensack and other points. The northern terminal was Piermont, New York, on the New York and Erie Rail Road, which had opened in 1841. After running on the Erie for one mile, trains reached the Northern's own line at Sparkill, New York, and ran for 21 miles to another junction with the Erie at Croxton in Jersey City, New Jersey. From there trains ran on the Erie and the New Jersey Railroad for two and a half miles to the terminal later called Exchange Place. Passengers could continue by ferry to Chambers St in Manhattan. Because of its running over the Erie, the Northern was built to the same 6-foot broad gauge. By September 1859, there were three passenger trains in each direction, with one express running from Piermont to Jersey City in 70 minutes. Sometime in the 1860s the Northern began running service westward from Sparkill on the Erie's Piermont Branch as far as Monsey, New York.Northern Railroad of New Jersey (The Next Station Will Be..., vol 4). Railroadians of America, 1976 The southern terminal was moved to the Erie's Jersey City Terminal late in 1868, about six months before the Northern Railroad's formal lease to the Erie. At that time the company had six locomotives, 21 passenger and baggage cars, and 30 freight cars. Not long after, a nominally separate company, the Nyack and Northern Railroad, built from Nyack south to meet the Northern at Sparkill, and from its opening in May 1870 Nyack became the northern terminal for most Northern Railroad trains. The Northern track was changed to standard gauge along with the rest of the Erie system in 1878. For five miles in Hudson County, Croxton to Granton, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway ran parallel to the Northern Railroad. Joint stations were constructed between the railroads with platforms on each side. By the time the Susquehanna was leased by the Erie in 1898, the companies operated the parallel section as one multi-track railroad, with the Northern Railroad's tracks used mostly for northbound trains. Although the Erie lease ended in 1940, the track-sharing continued to the late 1950s.Robert E. Mohowski (2003). The New York Susquehanna & Western Railroad. The Johns Hopkins University Press. The Northern Railroad was mainly a commuter and local line, with significant freight business only near its southern end. Business dropped off in the 1930s, and in 1942 the company's property was sold off to its long-term lessor, the Erie. From that time it was the Northern Branch.  Erie and Erie Lackawanna  Before re-routing to Hoboken Terminal, Northern Branch trains passed under DL&W; bridge near the western portals of the Long Dock Tunnel and later, Bergen Arches. By 1954, the Northern Branch had only three rush hour passenger trains each way.Erie Railroad Company employee timetable number 48, September 26, 1954 Between 1956 and 1958, the allied Erie and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;) consolidated their diminishing passenger services at the Lackawanna's Hoboken Terminal. During transition Erie trains continued to use the Erie Pavonia Terminal for about an hour in each rush hour, to distribute the heaviest crowds.Erie Railroad Suburban Timetables / Main Line, October 13, 1956 A Northern Branch train was the very last to leave Pavonia Erie Terminal in 1958. Two years later, the Pavonia Terminal was razed in 1961.Jersey City Past and Present: Erie Railroad Terminal The two companies merged in 1960 to form the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad. The Northern Branch ran from Hoboken for only eight years. Operation was complicated by the lack of a direct connection. Trains leaving Hoboken had to run out over the new connection (1956) to the former Erie Main Line, and then back up about two miles on the former route to the Erie terminal, and then proceed forward again into the Northern Branch. The move added 15 to 20 minutes to running time.Erie- Lackawanna Railroad Company employee timetable number 4, October 28, 1962 Because commuter services cost more to run than they earned in fares, the Erie-Lackawanna ended passenger service on several branches in 1966. On the Northern Branch, the entire railroad north of Sparkill was abandoned in January and passenger service on the rest of the branch was eliminated in October. The last timetable, April 24, 1966, shows three rush hour trains each way taking 60 minutes to run from Hoboken to Sparkill, only 10 minutes longer than 1954 schedules because of some station closings. Although freight service on the line continued, service into New York state stopped in the late 1970s after the Continental Can Company in Piermont closed.  Conrail & CSX  Single running track under the Pulaski Skyway connects to the Passaic and Harsimus Line at Marion Junction. ROW previously also connected to Bergen Hill Cut and Exchange Place Rebuilt Northern Running Track (left) along ROW where western slope of Bergen Hill descends to the Meadowlands. Parallel line originally developed as Hudson Connecting Railway, now NYS&W.; By the consolidation of Erie Lackawanna and Penn Central (among others) into Conrail in 1976, both the West Shore Railroad and the Northern Branch fell under the control of Conrail. As trains accessing the Northern Branch in Jersey City had to go to Journal Square and reverse direction, and the connection included a grade crossing of Newark Avenue, freight trains typically used the New Jersey Junction Railroad and West Shore Railroad, renamed as Conrail's River Line, to go through northern New Jersey. Around 1994, a short elevated track, known as the Marion Running Track, was built to connect the Passaic and Harsimus Line towards Kearny with the Northern Branch. This provided the Northern Branch with a direct connection to other lines heading west and south at Marion Junction. After the breakup of Conrail in 1999, the Northern Branch was divided. Conrail Shared Assets Operations retained the tracks from Marion Junction to the CSX yard in North Bergen, known as the Northern Running Track. CSX was given the remaining section north to Northvale, in addition to the West Shore Railroad running through the yard, known as the Bergen Subdivision of the River Line. With New Jersey Transit's 2000 creation of the Hudson‚ÄìBergen Light Rail on the River Line east of the CSX North Bergen Yard, freight trains needed an alternate route to get to the CSX Albany Division. Trains were re-routed via the Northern Running Track to access the Bergen Subdivision and this part of the Northern Branch became major CSX rail corridor from Upstate New York. At that time, the Northern Running Track was improved to handle the heavier traffic that had formerly used the River Line on the east side of the New Jersey Palisades. New Jersey Transit paid for the project, which included double-tracking the line, changing Marion Junction and Bergen Junction, and building overpasses on Secaucus Road and Paterson Plank Road. The rest of the Northern Branch continues north to the New York state line, and is a minor spur.  Route guide  Northern Branch passes under the River Line at Babbitt, North Bergen A map of the Northern Branch and surrounding railroads. The Northern Branch is the light blue line running almost straight from near the bottom of the map towards the top. The Marion Running Track is a short elevated track connecting the Passaic and Harsimus Line towards Kearny with the Northern Branch. It was built around 1994; prior to its opening, trains accessing the Northern Branch had to go to Journal Square and reverse direction, and the connection included a grade crossing of Newark Avenue (which the new connection overpasses). For these reasons, most freight trains instead used the River Line, passing through the Palisades in tunnels twice. Another grade crossing still exists at Saint Paul's Avenue, under the Pulaski Skyway and Truck US 1-9. This is now the only grade crossing on the Northern Running Track. Just north of this crossing, a second track begins; the line is double-tracked from here to the north end. North of there, the line passes under the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, now part of New Jersey Transit's Hoboken Division in the middle of West End Junction. These bridges were built in 1907, before which the tracks crossed at grade. Just north of the NJ Transit overpasses, the line enters Bergen Junction, and two tracks split to the west from the main line, which heads northwest to Croxton Yard. Soon the line passes over County Road on a rather old bridge. It then passes under Secaucus Road, whose bridge opened on May 20, 2002. The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway begins at the Land Bridge Terminal, just north of Secaucus Road, and parallels the Northern Running Track, just to the west, all the way to its end. The next three overpasses, over which pass the Northeast Corridor, Route 3, and Route 495, have never been grade crossings. The next overpass, Paterson Plank Road, opened on April 22, 2002. The Northern Running Track ends at North Bergen Yard, at what has been called Granton Junction, and is now CP 2. From here, it splits into two CSX lines, the Bergen Subdivision (which was part of Conrail's River Line until most of Conrail's assets were split), and CSX's Northern Branch. The Bergen Subdivision soon becomes the River Subdivision, and leads along the west side of the Hudson River towards Albany, New York. Beginning at CP 2, the CSX-owned Northern Branch is a lightly used freight spur that passes through eastern Bergen County, New Jersey, terminating at the state line in Northvale.

A Virginia hunting license was established as one of the primary sources of funding as the agency is fully self-sufficient and receiving no financial support from the state treasury. From 1903 until this point the Game Wardens had been administered by each locality. In 1920, the first Virginia State Game Farm of 1200 acres was established at Windsor Shades in New Kent County. In 1923, Mrs B. M. Miller and Mrs. C. E. Sykes are recognized among Virginia's first women game wardens. In 1926, the Department was separated from the Commission of Fisheries and reorganized into the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries chaired by A. Willis Robertson. In 1928 the Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries was given sole authority to shorten hunting seasons, removing the privilege from the localities to adjust their own season. In 1982, Virginia Game Wardens were given full law enforcement authority. In 1987, the Commission's name returns to become the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.

It takes its name from the stream which originally flowed where modern Epuni Street is. The stream's MƒÅori name was originally Wai-Mapihi, but it was commonly called Te Aro Stream due to it running through the Te Aro flat.  Geography  The Aro Valley is 126 hectares running between the hills of Brooklyn to the south, Kelburn to the north, with the area of Karori to the west and Te Aro, the city centre to the east. Much of Wellington consists of the remnants of an old peneplain, a flat expanse that rose from the sea about 20 million years ago. This land was heavily dissected by watercourses from that time and today the tops of the hills around Wellington indicate the general height of that eroded peneplain.Fundamentals of Geomorphology Richard J Huggett 2007 During this time massive faults appeared that are still active today. Aro Valley formed from fault activity. One kilometre to the west of Aro Valley is the Wellington Fault running north-east along the foot of the Tinakori Hills and beyond. A series of splinter faults branch off from the Wellington Fault. Activity along these faults over millions of years caused tilting of the land to create valleys, including Aro Valley, south-east of the main fault. Aro Valley, and its tributary valleys, are well sheltered from the wind and have soil enriched by past alluvial deposits. The valley walls are steep in places and house sites are correspondingly uneven, in typical Wellington fashion. The valley comprises part of the bed of the Wai-Mapihi Stream. Aro Street runs through the whole valley, from Willis Street in the east to Raroa Road in the west; major side-streets include Devon Street, Epuni Street, Adams Terrace, Mitchelltown's Holloway Road and Taitville's Norway Street. Parks Cardboard houses set up in Aro Valley Park A prominent feature of Aro Valley is Aro Park, which is the site of the former Matauranga School, which was itself on the site of the original Catholic school ‚Äì St Mary of the Angels. The Park was formerly known as Seed's Hill after an early (1864) resident, Mr. Wm. Seed. The Park has been extended and landscaped in recent years and is a focus for community recreation, especially on summer nights and weekends; the Aro Valley Community Centre stands on part of the park. in 2017 Wellington Council purchased a considerable area of land to the north west border of Aro Park which will form part of the Wellington Town Belt. Aro Valley is almost surrounded by parkland the Aro Park to the north, Polhill Gully Recreation Reserve to the Northwest and Tenera Reserve & Central Park to the Southeast.  Polhill Gully  Polhill Reserve on the western end of Aro Street, which is meant to have been named for an early Cornish (Cornwall in the UK) surveyor. In the mid-1840s a garrison of British troops was stationed on the upper ridges of this Gully, to protect the southern flank of the settlement from hostile Maori. The force grew to some 200 officers and men by 1845/6. By 1870 British troops had left the country, to encourage colonial 'self reliance'. In the early 1900s the gully, sometimes referred to as Polhill's Gully contained a man made reservoir. By the 1960s Victoria University was considering Polhill Gully and Holloway Road as potential sites for its own expansion and began buying houses but by the 1970s the plans were being actively challenged by a new generation of Mitchelltown residents who felt the houses and the neighbourhood were worth saving, and by others who envisaged the restoration of Polhill Gully for wildlife habitat and recreational use. Discussion, disagreement and protest went on for years, and the university finally abandoned its plans in the early 1980s. Polhill Gully became a City Council Recreation Reserve in 1989. Today the reserve is an attractive amenity used by more than a thousand cyclists, runners and walkers a week. It is also frequented by birds, including‚Äîthanks to the proximity of the Zealandia wildlife sanctuary‚Äîmany tui and kaka, and the occasional bellbird, grey warbler, North Island robin and saddleback.  History  The Aro Valley today is a largely untouched remnant of old Wellington, with the majority of its dwellings dating from the first two decades of the twentieth century, and a significant number from the nineteenth. The Wellington City Council notes: \\"The Valley projects a strong sense of place due to its geographical separation from other parts of the city, the enclosure of the valley walls and the relative consistency of development within.\\"  Nineteenth century  Early tribal occupants of the Aro Valley included NgƒÅti Mutunga, NgƒÅti Ruanui, Mua≈´poko and NgƒÅti Mamoe. In the 1830s Taranaki iwi Te ƒÄti Awa settled at its western end. The stream itself was an important food source for MƒÅori. It was called Waimapihi ‚Äì in Maori, \\"the stream or bathing place\\" of Mapihi, a local chieftainess of Mua≈´poko and NgƒÅti Mamoe descent. These small communities adapted as best they could to the influx of British settlers that began in 1840, but they took a blow in 1855 when an earthquake raised the low-lying land draining the marshes and cutting off their main source of both food and flax for trading. This misfortune, combined with widespread illness, migration back to Taranaki to settle land disputes, and pressure from settlers for land, gradually saw the MƒÅori population of Te Aro dwindle. 205 & 207 Aro Street. Built by George Baker, circa 1897. Historic Place Category 2 The land was part of the New Zealand Company purchase in 1839. It was first developed by settler Wellingtonians as a working-class residential suburb in around 1860, the Aro Valley featured small, narrow sections with closely built wooden or corrugated-iron houses. In the 1840 Plan of Wellington, the Aro Valley consisted of Wordsworth, Aro and Epuni Streets, as well as St John Street, which connected Aro Street and what became known as The Terrace. Of the 13 freehold acres available for European settlers, nine were in Epuni Street. European settlement grew as Maori left the area, including Te ƒÄti Awa who returned to Taranaki in the 1850‚Äì60s. Also, in 1855, the opening of the Old Bullock Track meant the valley became an access route for Karori settlers. The only other route to Karori followed what is now Glenmore Street from Thorndon. Devon Street in the north of Aro Valleys principal developer, William Adams and Elizabeth Adams, came from the Southern UK county of Devon. He purchased land here in 1885 and some of the houses built were occupied by his son and daughter in law Maxwell and Lila Adams.  Twentieth century  The opening of the William Booth Memorial Training College in 1914 (now Philosophy House). A route of the Wellington tramway system was opened in 1904, connecting Aro Street to the Wellington railway station via the city center; it closed in 1957. In the 1960s, The Evening Post described Holloway Road (a street originally known as Mitchelltown on the western edge of Aro Valley) as \\"sagging stairways with most of the tread rotted away\\", leading to \\"sagging, open doors and damp, musty rooms where glass from broken windows crunches underfoot\\". Matauranga School was a progressive primary school set up by Marie Bell and parents of Aro Valley in 1963 and was a pioneer for the 'free-play' method of pre-schooling within New Zealand. In 1967 it became a full primary school. The school closed in 1982 after Marie Bell and another teacher left the school. Gentrification has been ongoing in Aro Valley from the 1970s, boosted by urban-renewal planning (the Comprehensive Urban Renewal Area or CURA) after the rejection of a proposal to turn the valley into a main arterial road route: it became a desirable suburb, seen as close to the centre of Wellington and boasting notable community spirit. The Aro Valley Community Council was established in 1978 and was followed by the building of the Aro Valley Community Center. In 1974, the Aro Street public toilets were the scene of a Russian spy drama, when economist, historian and writer Bill Sutch was caught and charged with attempting to pass classified information to the Soviet Union. (Sutch was later acquitted.) The area's heritage value derives from the fact it contains the largest collection of unaltered working-class homes in Wellington, some built by local tradesmen for employees, many put up by professional builders and developers as speculative investments. Many of the buildings used as shops along Aro Street and a number of houses on Aro Street and Holloway Road are protected by designation on Wellington City Council Heritage List.http://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/your-council/plans-policies-and- bylaws/district-plan/volume01/files/v1chap21app.pdf?la=en WCC district plan  Sociology  Aro Valley also adjoins parts of Victoria University (mainly to the north), and a large number of Valley residents study there or at Massey University to the east. Despite the gentrification sometimes known as \\"yuppification\\" of the suburb, it keeps its reputation as a home to politico- social radicals. The area has a strong community council campaigning on a variety of issues such as eliminating plastic bag use in local shops. Alexandra Hollis writes in Salient that \\"although Aro is this liberal, artsy enclave, it is also very aware of this reputation.\\" Illustrating this artiness young film-makers based in Wellington in the late 90s and 2000 were dubbed the Aro Valley movement, they made feature-length narrative dramas, which they edited and assembled on computer editing suites. Politics James Shaw speaking at the 2014 Aro Valley candidates meeting. Shaw also lives in Aro Valley. Politically, Aro Valley has become a stronghold or \\"spiritual home\\" of the Green Party. In the 2011 general election, the Aro Valley Community Centre was the polling station with the most number of ballots for the Green Party in the country (619), and also was amongst the top polling stations in terms of percentage support for the Greens (at 44%). Before every general election the Aro Valley candidates meeting is held in the Aro Valley community hall. The atmosphere of the meetings can make them intimidating for candidates, who often face heckling from the audience.

History The St. Louis Car Company was formed in April 1887 to manufacture and sell streetcars and other kinds of rolling stock of street and steam railways supporting the traction industry. In succeeding years the company built automobiles, including the American Mors, the Skelton, and the Standard Six. The St. Louis Aircraft Corporation division of the company partnered with the Huttig Sash and Door company in 1917 to produce aircraft. During the two world wars, the company manufactured gliders, trainers, alligators, flying boats, and dirigible gondolas. Among their most successful products were the Birney Safety Car and the PCC streetcar, a design that was very popular at the time.Andrew D. Young and Eugene Provenzo, The History of the St. Louis Car Company (Howell North Books 1978) The firm went on to build some of the vehicles used in the transit systems of New York City and Chicago, as well as the FM OP800 railcars manufactured exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939. The St. Louis Car Company was headed by the late Edwin B. Meissner, Sr., who died at age 71 on Sept. 12, 1956. Meissner was president of the company, one of the nation‚Äôs largest manufacturers of railroad and light rail cars, and the St. Louis Aircraft Corporation. He was active for many years on the Jewish Federation Board of Directors, and served for over 20 years as President of Congregation Shaare Emeth. The St. Louis Car Co., later known as General Steel Industries, manufactured not only St. Louis streetcars and trolleys but cars for such far- flung transit systems as the Metro in Paris, France. Meissner‚Äôs son, Edwin B. Meissner, Jr., succeeded his father as head of the company, and continues to be an active member of Congregation Shaare Emeth. Streetcars held sway in St. Louis and its suburbs from the 1880s until the mid- and late 1940s. Andrew Young records that new state-of-the-art buses began to encroach on the streetcars domain. New streamlined streetcars were brought into service in 1946 to replace older cars, some dating back to 1903. In 1960, St. Louis Car Company was acquired by General Steel Industries. In 1964, St. Louis Car completed an order of 430 World's Fair picture-window cars (R36 WF) for the New York City Subway and was building 162 PA-1s (110 single units, 52 trailers)\\"An Ode to PATH's PA-1s\\", Philip G.

It was initially created as a reimagining of Toho's Godzilla but was later re-branded as a separate character. Patrick Tatopoulos designed it after iguanas with a slim theropod appearance as opposed to the bulky erect theropod designs of Toho's Godzilla. TriStar's Godzilla, both the film and character, were negatively received by fans and critics. In 2004, it was featured in Toho's Godzilla: Final Wars as \\"Zilla\\". Afterwards, Toho trademarked new incarnations as Zilla, with only the iterations from the 1998 film and animated series retaining the Godzilla copyright/trademark. The trademark for Zilla was cancelled in 2019. Overview=Name Toho's and Sony's trademarks for TriStar's Godzilla and Baby Godzilla. Toho's former trademark for later incarnations of TriStar's Godzilla. Initially, during production of Godzilla: Final Wars, director Ryuhei Kitamura asked producer Sh≈çgo Tomiyama whether or not they were allowed to include TriStar's Godzilla in the film, whereupon Tomiyama checked Toho's contract with Sony and saw they were allowed to use it, Tomiyama stated: \\"Kitamura asked me if it was possible for us to use the American Godzilla in Final Wars, so I checked our contract with Sony Pictures and found out we could use it. Since this was the 50th anniversary film, I thought ‚ÄòWhy not include the American Godzilla?'\\" This incarnation of TriStar's Godzilla was named \\"Zilla\\". This decision was made because they also felt that Emmerich's film had taken the \\"God\\" out of \\"Godzilla\\" by portraying the character as a mere animal. The name \\"Zilla\\" was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on counterfeit Godzilla products that use \\"Zilla\\" as a suffix. The \\"Zilla\\" name was trademarked by Toho in 2008 (subsequently cancelled in 2019) and this name change has been reflected in subsequent official products featuring the character since 2004, though \\"Godzilla\\" continues to be used on products that predate the name change, such as home media re-releases of the 1998 film and Godzilla: The Series. Matt Frank (co-writer and illustrator of Godzilla: Rulers of Earth) further clarified the name change, stating, \\"Toho makes zero distinction between \\"Zilla\\" and \\"Godzilla 1998\\" with the exception of title alone. Ever since 2004, Toho's official stance has been that any future incarnations of the character be referred to hereafter as 'Zilla'.\\" Keith Aiken (co-editor of SciFi Japan) also clarified that \\"Zilla is a variation of the 1998 Godzilla\\" but stressed that only the incarnations from the 1998 film and the animated series retain the Godzilla copyright and trademark. Development Kurt Carley in the adult Godzilla suit. During the production of the 1998 film, special effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos was contacted by director Roland Emmerich and asked to create a new design for the Godzilla character. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast. Emmerich intended to depict the character as an animal rather than a monster. Godzilla was originally conceived by special effects director Eiji Tsubaraya, special effects designers Akira Wantanabe and Teizo Toshimitsu and director Tomoyuki Tanaka as a robust, erect-standing, plantigrade reptilian sea monster, played by an actor in a rubber-latex full-body suit. Based on the instructions Emmerich gave him, Tatopoulos reimagined it as a lean, digitigrade bipedal iguana that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via computer animation. The monster's distinctive facial features include a prominent lantern jaw, inspired by the fictional tiger Shere Khan from Disney's animated adaptation of The Jungle Book. TriStar's Godzilla color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment. At one point, it was planned to use motion capture to create the movements of the computer-generated monster, but it ended up looking too much like a man in a suit. The Baby Godzilla scenes utilized a combination of CGI and purpose built costumes donned by actors. Kurt Carley portrayed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla in the 1998 film while Frank Welker provided the sound effects for both the adult Godzilla as well as the Baby Godzillas. Upon pending approval for the design, at the time, Sh≈çgo Tomiyama commented on the new look, saying \\"It was so different we realized we couldn't make small adjustments. That left the major question of whether to approve it or not.\\" Though TriStar's Godzilla was referred to by the film's characters as a \\"he\\", Patrick Tatopoulos stated on a DVD audio commentary that the effects crew sculpted female genitalia into the CG model of the creature.Patrick Tatopoulos; Godzilla 1998 Region 1 DVD special features, \\"Special FX Supervisor Commentary\\" (Scene 14: \\"He's pregnant.\\") Early concept artwork depicting the showdown between Godzilla and Zilla in Godzilla: Final Wars. In the 1998 film and animated series, TriStar's Godzilla is portrayed as a territorial, piscivorous, tall mutated lizard. Atypical of Toho's giant monster characters, TriStar's Godzilla is not immune to conventional weaponry, and instead relies on its cunning and athleticism to outflank its enemies. It can travel long distances over land and sea, burrow underground and reproduce via parthenogenesis, and is able to lay over 200 eggs, unlike its offspring in the animated series which was unable to reproduce. It possesses an ignitable radioactive breath weapon called \\"Power Breath\\", although its offspring could breathe a green atomic Power Breath in the animated series (where also the parent, resurrected as a cyborg called Cyber-Godzilla, possessed a blue version), in which it was pitted against a rogues gallery of original monsters, after the producers were unable to secure the rights to adapt Toho's classic monsters. It was also featured in advertisements alongside the Taco Bell chihuahua. TriStar's Godzilla was featured in the 2004 Toho film Godzilla: Final Wars as \\"Zilla\\"; this name would continue to be used and trademarked for later incarnations. A 3D scan of the Trendmasters \\"Ultimate Godzilla\\" toy was used as reference for Zilla. In the film, Zilla engages Toho's Godzilla in a battle intended \\"to show which Godzilla is stronger\\". Zilla would fight Godzilla again in a slightly longer battle, and even team up with Godzilla to fight other monsters, in the comic series by IDW Publishing titled Godzilla: Rulers of Earth running between 2013-2015. Reception The design and characterization of TriStar's Godzilla was negatively received. Film critic Richard Pusateri of G-Fan Magazine coined the acronym GINO (\\"Godzilla In Name Only\\") to distinguish it from Toho's Godzilla. while some fans referred to it as the \\"American Godzilla\\". The major points of criticism were centered around the character's radical deviation from the traditional Godzilla design, how it was portrayed fleeing from the military, how it did not breathe the traditional atomic heat ray, how it laid eggs, and was killed by missiles during the film's climax, as well as its departure from all the thematic elements, regarding nuclear warfare, of the original.\\"It Came from Japan!\\" Animal Planet documentary, 2005 These sentiments were echoed by veteran Godzilla suit actors Haruo Nakajima and Kenpachiro Satsuma, and by Shusuke Kaneko, director of the '90s Gamera films. Nakajima ridiculed the character design, stating: \\"Its face looks like an iguana and its body and limbs look like a frog\\". Satsuma walked out of the film, saying \\"it's not Godzilla, it doesn't have his spirit\\". Kaneko opined \\"[Americans] seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms\\", and later alluded to the character in his film Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack as a monster that Americans mistook for Godzilla. Thomas Tull (producer of Legendary's Godzilla series) criticized the design of TriStar's Godzilla, stating, \\"I‚Äôm always puzzled as a fan when you take things so far it‚Äôs unrecognizable.\\" Toho publicist Yosuke Ogura later called TriStar's design a \\"disaster.\\" The animated version of the character was more positively received than its live-action predecessor, due to being closer in line with the spirit of Toho's Godzilla, possessing the ability to breathe atomic fire, battle monsters, and withstand attacks. However, the negative response to both Emmerich's Godzilla as well as the Disney remake of Mighty Joe Young released that same year, had caused giant monster movies to fall out of vogue for several years after, with films such as Peter Jackson's King Kong remake being postponed until 2005. Poor merchandise sales for the film led to a cancellation of a toy line based on Godzilla: The Series, and resulted in significant financial losses for toy manufacturer Trendmasters. Nicholas Raymond from Screen Rant described Toho's subsequent treatment of TriStar's Godzilla as \\"a clear sign that Toho doesn't regard the 1998 Godzilla as the King of the Monsters. It would appear that to them, he's just a giant lizard.\\" Appearances TriStar's Godzilla featured in the game Godzilla Trading Battle. Zilla featured in Godzilla: Rulers of Earth #2. TriStar's Godzilla has only made two film appearances in Godzilla and Godzilla: Final Wars and was vaguely referenced in Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All- Out Attack. A trilogy of films were originally planned, and a treatment by Tab Murphy for Godzilla 2 was written, but the project was abandoned due to the poor reception of the 1998 film and TriStar let their license to Godzilla expire in 2003. An animated television series, Godzilla: The Series, was produced instead and served as a sequel to the 1998 film. It featured the surviving offspring from the 1998 film as the new Godzilla, as well as a reanimated cyborg version of its parent, named \\"Cyber-Godzilla\\". For the video games Godzilla: Save the Earth and Godzilla: Unleashed, developer Simon Strange decided not to include Zilla due to the character's unpopularity among fans. Strange received criticism from fans for not including Zilla in Godzilla: Unleashed.

Stickley's design philosophy was a major influence on American Craftsman architecture. Early life One of eleven children of German √©migr√©s Leopold and Barbara Schlager Stoeckel, Gustav Stickley was born Gustavus Stoeckel on March 9, 1858, in Osceola, Wisconsin. The eldest surviving son, Stickley experienced the rigors of life growing up on a small Midwestern farm, forgoing his formal education in 1870 to continue work in his father‚Äôs field of stonemasonry and help support his struggling family. By early 1876, Stickley‚Äôs mother and siblings moved to Brandt, Pennsylvania, where Gustav worked in his uncle‚Äôs chair factory ‚Äì his first formal training in the furniture industry. Early Career With his brothers Charles and Albert, Gustav formed Stickley Brothers & Company in 1883, the same year he married Eda Ann Simmons.Renn, Melissa. \\"Gustav Stickley.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified May 13, 2016. Within five years, the company was dissolved and Stickley‚Äôs ambitions led him to partner with Elgin Simonds, a salesman in the furniture trade, to form the firm Stickley & Simonds in Binghamton, New York. During the 1890s, Stickley divided his efforts between his new enterprise and the Auburn State Prison. At the prison he and his brother Leopold served as a foremen of furniture operations. In 1898, he orchestrated the removal of his business partner and formed the Gustave Stickley Company (he dropped the use of the \\"e\\" from his first name in 1903). In the summer of 1900, he worked with Henry Wilkinson and, possibly, LaMont A. Warner (soon his first staff designer) to create his first Arts and Crafts works in an experimental line called the New Furniture. In 1901, he changed the name of his firm to the United Crafts, issued a new catalogue written by Syracuse University professor Irene Sargent, and began to offer middle class consumers a host of progressive furniture designs in ammonia-fumed quartersawn white oak, as well as other mostly native woods. The Craftsman In October 1901, Stickley published the first issue of The Craftsman magazine, an important vehicle for promoting Arts and Crafts philosophy as well as the products of his factory within the context of articles, reviews, and advertisements for a range of products of interest to the homemaker. Lead articles in the first two issues paid tribute to two influencers of Stickley and Sargent's design philosophies: William Morris and John Ruskin. Nearly all of the first three issues of The Craftsman were written by Sargent, who thereafter wrote each issue's lead article, acted as the managing editor and designed the magazine's layouts.Zipf, Catherine W. Professional Pursuits: Women and the American Arts and Crafts Movement. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2007, pp. 143‚Äì48. The magazine also featured articles by libertarian socialists. Furniture design Adjustable- Back Chair No. 2342, Gustav Stickley, 1900. Stickley's new furniture reflected his ideals of simplicity, honesty in construction, and truth to materials. Unadorned, plain surfaces were enlivened by the careful application of colorants so as not to obscure the grain of the wood and mortise and tenon joinery was exposed to emphasize the structural qualities of the works. Hammered metal hardware, in armor-bright polished iron or patinated copper emphasized the handmade qualities of furniture which was fabricated using both handworking techniques and modern woodworking machinery within Stickley's Eastwood, New York, factory (now a part of Syracuse, New York). Dyed leather, canvas, terry cloth and other upholstery materials complemented the designs. Craftsman Farms Those ideals ‚Äì simplicity, honesty, truth ‚Äì were reflected in his trademark, which includes the Flemish phrase Als Ik Kan inside a joiner's compass. The phrase is generally translated 'to the best of my ability.' His firm's work, both nostalgic in its evocation of handicraft and the pre- industrial era and proto-modern in its functional simplicity, was popularly referred to as being in the Mission style, though Stickley despised the term as misleading. In 1903 he changed the name of his company again, to the Craftsman Workshops, and began a concerted effort to market his works ‚Äì by then including furniture as well as textiles, lighting, and metalwork ‚Äì as Craftsman products. Ultimately, over 100 retailers across the United States represented the Craftsman Workshops. In 1902, the later world-renowned sculptor Jerome Connor was hired to head up Stickley's metal work department.https://www.pbs.org/wned/elbert-hubbard/jerome-connor.php In May 1903 Stickley hired Rochester architect Harvey Ellis. Although Ellis died only a few months later, in January 1904, he had an immediate and profound effect upon design of The Craftsman magazine, its architectural offerings, and the furnishings Stickley was producing, reinforcing the connections between Stickley's work and that of English and Glaswegian designers. During this year Stickley's furniture evolved from solid, monumental forms to lighter shapes, relieved by arches, tapering legs, and ‚Äì in a new experimental line ‚Äì inlay as decoration. Within a year the inlay designs would be all but dropped from production save special orders, but the broader emphasis on less massive forms would remain. In keeping with this new emphasis, Stickley also began offering furniture in willow to complement the heavier oak designs. Furthering the development of his concept of the Craftsman home, in late 1903 he announced the formation of the Craftsman Home Builders Club to provide architectural plans from The Craftsman to its subscribers. The homes were offered in a number of archetypes familiar to American public ‚Äì the farmhouse, town house, cottage, and bungalow, among others. Natural materials and soft colors predominated and interiors were invariably prescribed to include simplified moldings, stained wood, and characteristic features such as built-in cabinets and fireplaces with inglenooks for seating. Although these homes were only rarely innovative in terms of progressive style, designs reflected current approaches to open floor plans, economy of function, and use of novel materials for walls, roofs, and surface treatments. Craftsman Farms Stickley moved his headquarters to New York City in 1905 and by 1907 began to acquire property to establish a boarding school for boys in Morris Plains, New Jersey (what is now Parsippany, New Jersey). Craftsman Farms was designed to include vegetable gardens, orchards, dairy cows and chickens.Mark Alan Hewitt, Gustav Stickley's Craftsman Farms: The Quest for an Arts and Crafts Utopia, Syracuse Univ. Press, 2001, Chapter 3. The main house there is constructed from chestnut logs and stone found on the property. As he wrote in The Craftsman: > There are elements of intrinsic beauty in the simplification of a house > built on the log cabin idea. First, there is the bare beauty of the logs > themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open > charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and > ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture. > ... The quiet rhythmic monotone of the wall of logs fills one with the > rustic peace of a secluded nook in the woods. Although the main house at Craftsman Farms was initially conceived of as a clubhouse for students, lack of interest in the school prompted Stickley to live there with his family instead. The planned school never became a reality. By 1913, changing tastes and the financial strain of his new twelve-story Craftsman Building in Manhattan, conceived as a department store, began to take their toll; in 1915 he filed for bankruptcy, stopping publication of The Craftsman in December 1916 and selling Craftsman Farms in 1917. Legacy Gustav Stickley died on April 21, 1942. He is buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York. In recent decades, Stickley and his work have become popularly recognized once again. It is particularly his early furniture, produced between 1900 and 1904, that is often seen as appealing to collectors. In 1988, Barbra Streisand paid $363,000 for a Stickley sideboard from the Gustav Stickley House in Syracuse; magazines such as Style 1900Style 1900 (out of print as of January 2013) and American BungalowAmerican Bungalow cater to those interested in the Arts and Crafts movement. A major touring exhibition organized by the Dallas Museum of Art, Gustav Stickley and the American Arts & Crafts Movement, opened at the Newark Museum on September 15, 2010. The exhibition then opened at the Dallas Museum of Art on February 18, 2011, and remained on view until May 8, 2011, before opening at the San Diego Museum of Art on June 18, 2011, subsequently closing on September 11, 2011. Gustav's brothers Leopold Stickley (Lee), Albert Stickley, Charles Stickley and John George Stickley also produced Arts and Crafts furniture. Although no longer held by the Stickley family, the successor firm to the L. & J.G. Stickley Company continues to operate in Manlius, New York, producing a variety of styles, including many original Gustav Stickley Arts and Crafts designs. The Company operates a museum, located in the original L & J. G. factory build. It features the work of the Stickley brothers and is located near its current factory site.Stickley Museum website See also * Arts and Crafts movement * Craftsman Farms, Parsippany, New Jersey * Gustav Stickley House, Syracuse, New York ReferencesFurther reading * Cathers, David M.

Although the theme is not particularly shocking in the present day, at the time it was considered quite scandalous; it even caused the author to lose his Legion of Honour. It has been adapted into a film four times, the most notably in 1936.

The season officially started on June 15, when the United States Weather Bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity; the season officially ended on November 15. It was the first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on the United States; as Hurricane How was the only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season. As in the 1950 season, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used to name storms this season. The first hurricane of the season, Able, formed prior to the official start of the season; before reanalysis in 2015, it was once listed as the earliest major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. It formed on May 16 and executed a counterclockwise loop over the Bahamas; later it brushed the North Carolina coastline. Hurricane Charlie was a powerful Category 4 hurricane that struck Jamaica as a major hurricane, killing hundreds and becoming the worst disaster in over 50 years. The hurricane later struck Mexico twice as a major hurricane, producing deadly flooding outside of Tampico, Tamaulipas. The strongest hurricane, Easy, spent its duration over the open Atlantic Ocean, briefly threatening Bermuda, and was formerly listed as one of a relatively few Category 5 hurricanes on record over the Atlantic Ocean. It briefly neared Category 5 status and interacted with Hurricane Fox, marking the first known instance of a hurricane affecting another's path.

Ships recorded moderate gales up to in connection with the new surface low, which formed several hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda. While initially lacking tropical attributes, the cyclone headed southeast for two days before curving southwestward. As it did so, the temperature of the system warmed in its lower levels, causing the cyclone to evolve into a more barotropic system. Late on January 4, the system shrank in size and began developing an inner core; reanalysis determined that the system became a tropical storm at this time, though it would have likely been considered subtropical beginning in the early 1970s. Hurricane Able The origins of the first hurricane of the season were from a trough that exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12\\\\. A low-pressure area developed on May 14, and two days later it developed into a tropical cyclone about 300 miles (480 km) south of Bermuda. It formed beneath an upper-level low, and initially was not fully tropical. The depression followed the low, initially toward the northwest and later the southwest. Moving over the Gulf Stream, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Able on May 16. The storm turned to the south, and Hurricane Hunters reported that Able strengthened to hurricane status on May 17 off the coast of Florida. The outer rainbands of Able produced light rainfall and high seas along the Florida coastline. It later moved through the northern Bahamas early on May 18, where it produced hurricane-force winds of . The hurricane later turned to the north, gradually strengthening through May 21\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Able passed about 70 miles (110 km) east of Cape Hatteras before turning east and reaching its peak of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on May 22. Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides but little damage. Able maintained hurricane intensity for two more days before weakening to a tropical storm early on May 24\\\\. Able rapidly dissipated that same day, though originally it was assessed as having evolved into an extratropical cyclone on May 23. Until 2015, Able was listed as having peak winds of and was analyzed to have been the earliest major hurricane on record. Such a storm would be a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, a system developed and introduced in the 1970s. Able was also the strongest hurricane outside of the current hurricane season (June 1 through November 30). However, reanalysis by scientists in 2015 determined that Able was in fact far weaker than originally listed in HURDAT, the official database containing information on storm tracks and intensities in the Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific regions. It also lost its distinction as the strongest preseason cyclone on record, the record being held by a Category 2 hurricane in March 1908. The hurricane was one of four North Atlantic hurricanes on record to exist during the month of May, the others occurring in 1889, 1908, and 1970. Tropical Storm Baker On August 2, an easterly wave spawned a tropical depression about 680 miles (1095 km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northwestward, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Baker. Early on August 3, the storm attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), and the next day passed about 275 mi (445 km) east of Bermuda. At its peak intensity, the gale- force winds extended 100 miles (160 km) to the north of the center. After attaining its peak, Baker quickly weakened on August 4 and turned to the northeast. Early the next day, it regained some of its former strength before losing its identity. Baker never affected land. Hurricane Charlie The third tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 12 from a tropical wave, 930 miles (1,495 km) east-southeast of Barbados. After a few days without further development, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Charlie on August 14, and subsequently crossed through the Lesser Antilles a day later with winds of . Shortly after entering the Caribbean Sea, the storm intensified to hurricane status early on August 16\\\\. Passing south of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, Charlie then underwent rapid deepening beginning late that day, its winds increasing in 24 hours. As it neared the island of Jamaica early on August 18, Charlie became a major hurricane and shortly afterward struck just south of Kingston with winds of ‚Äîequivalent to a strong Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, making Charlie, along with Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the strongest ever to hit the island. On the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall up to . The combination of strong winds and the rains left around $50 million (1951 USD, $380 million 2005 USD) in crop and property damage. Across the country there were 152 deaths, 2,000 injuries, and 25,000 people left homeless; as a result, it was considered the worst disaster in the country in the 20th century until Hurricane Gilbert produced even costlier damage, though with fewer reported fatalities.Pan American Health Organization Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Relief Coordination Program. (1999-02-20) \\"The Hurricane and its Effects: Hurricane Gilbert - Jamaica\\" . Centro Regional de Informaci√≥n sobre Desastres Am√©rica Latina y El Caribe. Retrieved 2012-03-04. After making landfall, Charlie weakened in its passage over the mountainous center of Jamaica, and by the time it left the island, its winds had diminished to . Charlie later passed south of the Cayman Islands, with Grand Cayman reporting peak wind gusts of . As it did so, the storm began to undergo yet another period of rapid intensification beginning on August 19\\\\. It regained major hurricane status late that day, and early on August 20 Charlie peaked at 130 mph (215 km/h), equivalent to low-end Category 4 status. Maintaining its strength, the hurricane then made landfall on the southern tip of Cozumel and hit the Mexican mainland near Akumal on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The strong winds destroyed 70% of the crops along its path, although no deaths were reported in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Several homes were wrecked in the region. As it moved inland, Charlie weakened rapidly over land, reaching the Bay of Campeche as a minimal hurricane early on August 21\\\\. Once over water, it failed to re- intensify for a full day, but began doing so early on August 22\\\\. As it did so, it rapidly re-intensified for a third and final time, reaching peak winds of before striking near the city of Miramar, just north of Tampico. It dissipated on August 23\\\\. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the region, flooding rivers and causing dams to burst. Hundreds of people were killed in the Mexican mainland, and across Charlie's entire path, damage was estimated at over $75 million (1951 USD, $ USD). The outer fringes of the storm increased surf along the Texas coast. Hurricane Dog A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 27 southwest of Cape Verde. It moved westward, eventually intensifying into a tropical storm early on August 31\\\\. The next day, the storm was first observed by Hurricane Hunters, several hundred miles east of Barbados, and it was named \\"Dog\\". By that time, its winds were around , and the storm continued intensifying as it approached the Lesser Antilles. On September 2, Dog attained hurricane status, reaching its peak of 90 mph (150 km/h) as it passed between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique. The storm, then quite small in diameter, produced strong wind gusts of up to at the airport in Fort-de-France on Martinique. However, this peak was short-lived, for upon entering the eastern Caribbean Sea Dog began a slow but steady weakening trend. On September 4, Dog weakened to tropical storm status to the south of Hispaniola, and the next day dissipated in the western Caribbean. In northern Saint Lucia, the combination of flooding and high winds destroyed 70% of the banana crop. Two sailing vessels were destroyed, and another one damaged. Across the island, Hurricane Dog killed two people from drownings. Damage was heavier on Martinique, located on the north side of the storm. The hurricane's winds destroyed 1,000 homes and the roofs of several others. Downed trees blocked roads and disrupted power lines. The winds also destroyed 90% of the banana crop and 30% of the sugar cane. Throughout Martinique, Dog left $3 million in damage (1951 USD, $ USD) and killed five people from drownings. It was considered the \\"most violent storm\\" in Martinique in 20 years. Initially the hurricane was expected to strike Jamaica, prompting hurricane warnings for the country, as well as along the southern coast of Hispaniola. Jamaica was struck by Hurricane Charlie a few weeks prior, and the threat from Dog prompted coastal evacuations and the closure of an airport. Ultimately, Dog dissipated and produced only light rainfall on the island. Hurricane Easy Hurricane Easy, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season, was a powerful and long-lived Cape Verde-type hurricane that originated as a tropical depression on September 1 between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Moving generally west-northwestward, the depression deepened into a tropical storm late that day, and further to hurricane status by September 3\\\\. On September 5, the cyclone reached its first peak of , but failed to continue strengthening. Its winds fluctuated through the early morning on September 6, but then resumed strengthening, reaching major hurricane status by that evening. During this period, Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to monitor its progress, recording a minimum pressure of on September 6 to the north of the Lesser Antilles. The next day, an aircraft was unable to penetrate the center, estimating winds of south of the eye. On this basis, Easy was once classified as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; A reanalysis in 2015 lowered the peak winds to 150 mph (240 km/h) on September 8\\\\. This was based on the Hurricane Hunters reporting a pressure of on the previous day, and a ship reporting winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). By the time Easy attained peak intensity, it had turned to the north and northeast while beginning a steady weakening trend. It interacted with the small Hurricane Fox to the east; this was the first observed instance of a hurricane affecting another's path. Easy then turned to the northeast, passing a short distance southeast of Bermuda on September 9 with winds of . Easy evolved into an extratropical cyclone late on September 11, while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The remnants lost their hurricane-force winds on September 12, only to briefly regain them two days later. On September 14, Easy lost its identity over the northern Atlantic Ocean after it was absorbed by another extratropical storm to the north. The Weather Bureau advised Bermuda to take precautionary measures in advance of the storm; tourists and residents \\"worked feverishly\\" to complete preparations, and the United States Air Force issued \\"a formal warning at noon.\\" Numerous hotels and homes were shuttered. Heavy traffic snarled evacuations, and 100 tourists were stranded on the island without \\"roundtrip reservations.\\" Air Force aircraft returned to the United States, and personnel secured various facilities at the island's base. On Bermuda, the hurricane produced winds of only , which downed a few banana trees. In addition to affecting Bermuda, the strong winds of the hurricane damaged a few ships along its path. Hurricane Fox Around the same time as Easy was forming, a new tropical depression developed in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. Moving generally westward, it passed south of the Cape Verde islands, quickly strengthening into Tropical Storm Fox early on September 3; by that time, its motion turned to the west-northwest. On September 5, Fox attained hurricane status, around the same time as it was first observed by ships. Two days later, Hurricane Hunters reported peak winds of , making it a major hurricane, albeit one of very small extent. Around that time, Fox interacted with Hurricane Easy to its northwest. After maintaining peak winds for 12 hours, Fox began a steady weakening trend, accelerating to the north and northeast ahead of Easy and passing to the east of Bermuda. On September 10, Fox, while still of hurricane force, became extratropical between the Azores and Greenland in the far north Atlantic. It turned towards the north and dissipated on September 11 off the southwest coast of Iceland. Although a few ships were affected by the hurricane's winds, there were no reports of any damage. Tropical Storm George Tropical Storm George developed in the Bay of Campeche on September 19\\\\. Moving west-northwestward, it quickly attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h late on the next day, as reported by the Hurricane Hunters. George later made landfall on September 21 in Mexico about 55 mi (90 km) south of Tampico as a moderate tropical storm. Before it moved ashore, the storm spread rainfall along the coast and increased waves, causing one drowning death. George quickly dissipated upon making landfall, and there were no reports of damage. Hurricane How An easterly wave spawned a tropical depression in the western Caribbean Sea on September 29\\\\. It moved north-northwestward for a few days before turning eastward in the central Gulf of Mexico. Based on Hurricane Hunter reports, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm How late on September 30, and it continued to strengthen as it approached Southwest Florida. On October 2, How attained its first peak of just before making landfall near Boca Grande, and within the day it crossed southern Florida. At the time, the storm was not well organized, and its strongest winds were confined to squalls in the Florida Keys and the southeast coast. Wind damage was minor, although heavy rainfall was reported, peaking at 15.7 inches (40 cm) near where it moved ashore. The precipitation caused significant street flooding, while about of tomato and bean fields were deluged. The storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean between Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, quickly intensifying to hurricane strength by October 3\\\\. Turning northeastward, How reached its second and strongest peak of on October 4 as it passed near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides and minor damage. Subsequently, the hurricane briefly weakened, only to recover its peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) on October 5\\\\. It passed southeast of Cape Cod before turning more to the east-northeast, causing road closures due to high tides. Offshore, the hurricane sank a ship, killing 17 people. While still of hurricane force, How became an extratropical storm on October 6, and a few days later it curved to the northeast. The extratropical cyclone later struck Iceland with hurricane-force winds on October 9\\\\. A couple of days later, the remnants of How dissipated in the far northern Atlantic. Overall, Hurricane How caused about $2 million (1951 USD, $ USD) in damage. Tropical Storm Item A tropical depression formed southwest of Jamaica on October 12\\\\. A small system, it moved northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Item on October 13\\\\. It turned toward the north, and the next day attained peak winds of after moving through the Cayman Islands. Based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters, Item was upgraded to hurricane status in real time, although a reanalysis in 2015 lowered the peak winds to 65 mph (100 km/h. Item lost tropical storm status on October 16 as it drifted to the northwest. Continuing a slow weakening trend, it passed just east of the Isla de la Juventud before striking western Cuba as a tropical depression on October 17\\\\. Later that day it dissipated in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The threat of the hurricane prompted precautions to be made in parts of Cuba. Additionally, storm warnings were posted in the Florida Keys, southern mainland Florida, as well as the Bahamas. However, no damage was reported. Hurricane Jig One of the last tropical cyclones of the season formed on October 15 just northeast of the Bahamas. Although listed as a tropical storm, it would have likely been classified as a subtropical cyclone beginning in the 1970s, but was unable to be classified as such given the lack of satellite imagery to prove its status. Given the name \\"Jig\\", it moved northeastward, quickly attaining hurricane status with winds of 75 mph 120 km/h), which it maintained for a full day. On October 16, Jig began a slow weakening trend, weakening below hurricane force and turning sharply northeastward. During this time, the storm made its closest approach to the southeastern United States while passing well southeast of Cape Hatteras. While offshore, the storm increased surf along the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines, prompting storm warnings. Early October 18, Jig became extratropical with winds of and began a counterclockwise loop over the western Atlantic. The next day it turned to the southeast before dissipating about south of Bermuda on October 20. Hurricane Twelve In early December, a cold front passed north of Bermuda. A disturbance along the front began rotating on December 2, developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on the next day. By late on December 3, the storm attained hurricane-force winds, and it increasingly became the dominant system within the broad frontal region. A ridge to the east turned this storm to the southwest. The winds diminished below hurricane-intensity on December 5, and concurrently the inner structure became more tropical as the frontal features dissipated. During this time, ships in the region reported strong winds, mostly to the north. Increasing water temperatures fueled atmospheric instability, likely causing an increase in convection, and the system was potentially a subtropical cyclone on December 6, while located about 1,015 mi (1,635 km) east-northeast of Bermuda. A nearby ship recorded a minimum pressure of around that time. After the storm turned to the southeast, a ship in the region reported winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) near the center and a pressure of , while a weather station indicated that the system had a warm core. The data suggested that the system became a fully tropical hurricane by 12:00 UTC on December 7, and that it likely had evolved into a tropical storm six hours earlier. By 18:00 UTC that night, the hurricane attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). On December 8, the hurricane turned to the east and weakened into a tropical storm, steered by an approaching trough. Over the next day, the storm accelerated to the east- northeast toward the Azores. Late on December 10, the storm moved through the Azores as a tropical storm, although it was reverting to an extratropical storm at the time. By 06:00 UTC on December 11, the system was extratropical again after it rejoined with a nearby cold front. It likely merged with another nontropical storm to its east on December 12, although it is possible the former hurricane remained a distinct system. A building ridge near Spain forced the extratropical system to the southeast, eventually dissipating after coming ashore in Morocco on December 15.  Storm names  These names were used to name storms during the 1951 Atlantic hurricane season.

Biography Masson emigrated from the Burgundy region of France in 1878 (at the age of 19) to California, United States, where he met Charles Lefranc (owner of the Almaden Vineyard and Wine Company), one of a number of French immigrants who had expanded the viticulture introduced into the Santa Clara Valley by the Catholic mission fathers. Masson went back to France in 1880 to finish school at The Sorbonne. After college he returned to San Jose, California due to the depression in the French wine industry caused by the Phylloxera plague and became the winemaker at Almaden. After the death of Lefranc, Paul purchased 573 acres in Saratoga, California, which he named La Cresta. He set about to plant 60 acres, mainly Pinot Noir and Chardonnay with cuttings from Burgundy and re-named the new winery the Paul Masson Champagne Company, now known as The Mountain Winery. According to the Paul Masson company web site, in 1892 Masson's first sparkling wine under the name \\"champagne\\" was introduced at Almaden, and Masson eventually became known as the \\"Champagne King of California\\" after winning at the Paris Expo in 1900. He was appointed to California's Board of State Viticultural Commissioners on August 30, 1913. Masson died at his home in San Jose on October 22, 1940, and is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park. Winery Label, Paul Masson Champagne Company, Oeil de Perdix Masson shifted part of his production to the Santa Cruz Mountains above Saratoga, California and built his \\"chateau\\" on a knob overlooking the Santa Clara Valley in 1905. Now known as \\"The Mountain Winery\\", the Paul Masson Mountain Winery is on the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places, though it ceased making wines in 1952. Instead, it serves as a conferencing and events venue - various events are held at the winery, such as concert series, weddings, and other special events. A famous chess tournament was held there annually for a number of years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Paul Masson Mountain Winery National Park Service. Retrieved from on 2004-12-28 Around 2000, the then-current owners of the site hired winemaker Jeffrey Patterson to restart winemaking on site. The vineyards were reestablished at the Mountain Winery in 2004. Advertising Orson Welles presented a series of distinctive ads for Paul Masson from 1978 to 1981. The Paul Masson brand is best remembered for its 1978-1981 marketing association with actor-director Orson Welles, who promised for Masson: \\"We will sell no wine before its time.\\" An infamous, widely circulated and much-parodied outtake for one commercial from the campaign features Welles attempting to deliver his lines while severely inebriated. Welles was eventually fired as a spokesman for the brand in 1981, after answering a question about Paul Masson on a TV chat show, saying that he was now on a diet and so no longer drank wine; he was (briefly) replaced as spokesman by Sir John Gielgud. Despite the ads' success at the time, the Paul Masson brand has suffered from a long-term image problem, particularly since its founder's death in 1940, in being synonymous with low-end wines. As The New York Times observed in 1990: \\"While many consumers know them - who can forget Orson Welles's breathy incantation of 'We will sell no wine before its time' for Masson - they lack cachet.\\" Paul Masson and NASA In the 1970s NASA bought Masson Rare Cream Sherry for a Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a \\"zero-G\\" aircraft. Unfortunately, the smell quickly permeated the cabin making astronauts physically sick, and public pressure over taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon their plans. Ownership After the death of his wife, Louise Lefranc, Masson put the winery up for sale. Mentored by Paul Masson, Martin Ray (a pioneer, dedicated to crafting single varietal, region-specific wine from 1943 through 1972 in Saratoga, in the heart of the Santa Cruz Mountains), purchased the winery and vineyards. Six years later, Martin Ray sold The Paul Masson winery and brand to The Seagram Company, Ltd, the global wine and spirits company (along with minority share owners). In the 1980s, Seagram also acquired the Taylor California Cellars brand (and production facilities) from Coca-Cola, based on the premise promoted by then Seagram Strategic Planning head, Mary Cunningham, that the only way to succeed in the wine business was to approach Gallo's massive sales volume. Over the next twenty years, the wine industry would dramatically segment itself with, essentially, all the large volume brands falling by the wayside. Internal competition and resulting cannibalization dramatically reduced the combined sales of Paul Masson and Taylor (as it did with Almaden and Inglenook, also owned by a single parent company). These changes resulted in the Paul Masson brand being sold to Vintners International in 1987. Vintners was in turn purchased by the Centera Wine Company (formerly \\"Canandaigua\\") of New York in 1993, as part of Vintner's bankruptcy proceedings. Canandaigua was then renamed Constellation Brands in 2000. In 2008, Wine Group LLC of San Francisco purchased the Paul Masson winery, which had ceased making wine in 1952, and now serves as a conferencing and events center.

The lake is situated near in the Limestone Coast region of South Australia, and is one of four crater lakes on Mount Gambier maar. Of the four lakes, only two remain, as the other two (Leg of Mutton and Brown) have dried up over the past 30 to 40 years as the water table has dropped. Conflicting dates have been estimated for its last eruption, of 4,300 years ago, of 28,000 years ago, and most recently, a little before 6,000 years ago. If the youngest date is correct, this could be the most recent volcanic eruption on the Australian mainland. Blue Lake is thought to be of an average depth of , but in places reaches deep (but some unconfirmed values mention a maximum depth due to a natural cave section). The crater rim measures , but the lake itself measures . The bottom of the lake is below the level of the main street of the nearby town. The Blue Lake supplies the town with drinking water. Studies Bathymetric surveys located the deepest point in the lake at in 1967. Major diving exploration of the lake first occurred in 1985. Cave diver Peter Horne conducted temperature and visibility studies and made discoveries of a freshwater sponge species and other invertebrates. This exploration also discovered the Stromatolite Field, a collection of hollow rock formations that are found along the north-eastern perimeter down to a depth of . In 2008, permission was granted by SA Water for another diving exploration of the central and deepest parts of the lake. On this dive, core samples from the calcite-silt covered lake bed were collected where water temperature drops to .  Annual colour change During December to March, the lake turns to a vibrant cobalt blue colour, returning to a colder steel grey colour for April to November. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still a matter of conjecture, but likely it involves the warming of the surface layers of the lake during the summer to around , causing calcium carbonate to precipitate out of the solution and enabling microcrystallites of calcium carbonate to form. This results in scatter of the blue wavelengths of sunlight. During winter, the lake becomes well mixed, and recent research indicates that during this phase of the colour cycle, the lake is somewhat murkier due to the redistribution of tannins and calcium carbonate particles throughout the lake. Solar elevation has also been found to influence the perceived colour of the lake. The movement of planktonic life forms within the lake during the seasons and during the day may additionally play a part in the colour change. Gordon's Leap In July 1865, Adam Lindsay Gordon performed the daring riding feat known as Gordon's Leap on the edge of the Blue Lake. A commemorative obelisk erected there has an inscription which reads: > This obelisk was erected as a memorial to the famous Australian poet. From > near this spot in July, 1865, Gordon made his famed leap on horseback over > an old post and rail guard fence onto a narrow ledge overlooking the Blue > Lake and jumped back again onto the roadway.

A throne room or throne hall is the room, often rather a hall, in the official residence of the crown, either a palace or a fortified castle, where the throne of a senior figure (usually a monarch) is set up with elaborate pomp‚Äîusually raised, often with steps, and under a canopy, both of which are part of the original notion of the Greek word thronos. Function A throne room is an impressive setting for a monarch to preside 'in majesty' over official ceremonies, to hold council, to grant audiences, to receive homage, to award high honors and offices, and to perform other official functions. Any of these could just as well be transferred, even on a permanent basis, to one or more other rooms, even outside the palace or ambulant. It can also be where the royal court can gather. A common misconception is that kings and other ruling princes governed their lands seated on a throne for most of the working day. This may have been true in earlier times, for some rulers who actually presided over their council; yet often, another room was used, but only in peacetime. Many others were almost constantly on the move with an ambulant court. It could even have been that the crown did not have an effective capital, as in England during most of the time before the Norman conquest. Or it could have been that the crown had, rather, a series of alternative residences, as did the Holy Roman Emperors. In their case, these developed into palatinates under the Habsburg Dynasty when they also acquired extensive crown lands outside Germany and Austria, and their court often travelled on an almost continental scale. Other monarchies frequently changed their capital, but then they would have used a mobile throne, possibly in addition to the permanent one used for enthronement and/or coronation. There are cases in Africa and Asia where the very name of the 'capital' is not a fixed place, but was the place wherever a king settled for a few years. In some climates court migrated annually between a summer and a winter capital. It has also common to spend quite some time, without need for practical reason, in secondary residences, not in the least hunting lodges. Even when their capitals were fixed, English and French Renaissance kings used to travel extensively, and maintained many royal castles, in addition to paying visits to grandees of the realm. Henry VIII's most frequently used residence was, in fact, at Hampton Court, which was then outside London. Even when in the main or only palace, the monarch often spent much time in other parts of the residence, such as the dining hall, the chapel, private quarters (for rest and family life), possibly a separate presence room, the council chamber, ballroom, gardens, court, theatre, and other recreational facilities. Nowadays, throne rooms are only used for occasional grand ceremonies. Paperwork is done in an office, and most guests are received in a salon. Notable examples The following are notable throne rooms. Others are listed in the article on thrones. AustriaHofburg= Once the seat of the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire for over 600 years, the Hofburg Imperial Palace's throne room now serves as a conference centre, used by the Austrian Congress and for other international events. Canada The chamber of the Senate of Canada in Centre Block, which takes many of its design cues from the chamber of the British House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster, contains three thrones at its head. These thrones are used for the annual Speech from the Throne, which can be seen as a form of royal audience for Parliament, and thus the Senate chamber can be seen as a throne room in the royal presence. China The principal imperial throne of China, in the Hall of Supreme Harmony In the Forbidden City, China's last imperial palace, the principal throne rooms are the three halls of the Outer Palace: the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Preserving Harmony, of which the Hall of Supreme Harmony was the most important. DenmarkRosenborg= 200px The throne in the throne room at Rosenborg Castle (now a museum) in Copenhagen was commissioned by King Frederik III in about 1663, and used by the absolutist kings of Denmark from 1671 to 1840 for the anointing ceremony. It was probably created by Bendix Grodtschilling. It was inspired by King Solomon's throne which, according to the Bible, was made of ivory and had six steps with lion figures on each. Tooth of Narwhal was chosen as the material, both because it was found in Danish waters and owing to its mythical associations with the unicorn; twelve lions were also commissioned, three of which, in silver, have been preserved in the room. =Christiansborg= The throne room actually used for receiving ambassadors is at Christiansborg. The Throne Room at Christiansborg is where foreign ambassadors present their credentials to the Queen. FranceVersailles= The throne was commissioned by King Louis XIV and was in use until 1789. In 1837, the Ch√¢teau de Versailles became a national museum. As part of the greater Versailles museum, the room is open to the public. Compare: Lit de justice. =Fontainebleau Palace= Preferring Fontainebleau over Versailles, Emperor Napol√©on I had King Louis XV's bedroom converted into an Imperial throne room, and it was here that Napol√©on abdicated. The palace was last used by Napol√©on III; it was later declared a national monument in 1871, after the collapse of the French Empire. Monaco: Prince's Palace, For over 700 years, the Grimaldi family have ruled Monaco, and it is in this throne room that many historic festivals and ceremonies have taken place since the 16th century. It is also where most civil marriages of the Princely Family occur, before then having a religious ceremony elsewhere. Germany Thrones of the King and Queen, Residenz of Munich, Bavaria =Residence of Munich= The Residenz of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria has one celebration room, which was the former throne-room, but completely destroyed by the bombing of Munich during the Second World War. It is now reconstruated and again visitable; the (smaller) throne room was rebuilt in the classicism style of the 19th century. Once, bronze figures of twelve rulers of the house of Wittelsbach stood there, between corinthic columns on a rostrum. These were the honourable monarchs of Bavaria for centuries. =Neuschwanstein= Note that the throne room of this beautiful, dream-like castle, Neuschwanstein, does not have a throne in it - the reason being that Ludwig II of Bavaria, its commissioner, did not live to see Neuschwanstein's completion, therefore one was never installed. Iolani Palace throne room Warsaw Royal Castle, Poland Hawaii ªIolani Palace= The throne room at  ªIolani Palace was used by King David KalƒÅkaua, his wife Queen Kapi ªolani, and his successor Queen Liliuokalani. KalƒÅkaua and his wife actually disliked sitting on the thrones, instead preferring to stand in front of them while receiving guests. King KalƒÅkaua held formal audiences, diplomatic receptions, and state balls, receiving and entertaining guests from all walks of life, from royalty and diplomats to writers, entertainers, and sportsmen. Following her overthrow, the trial of Queen Lili ªuokalani also occurred in this room where she was found guilty and imprisoned within the palace by the Republic of Hawaii. The throne room, like the rest of the palace, is open to the public. Portugal Ajuda National Palace Throne Room Palacio Real de Madrid Throne Room Grand Throne room in Peterhof Palace =Ajuda Palace, Lisbon= The Portuguese Throne room (pt. Sala do Trono) is in the Piano nobile of the Ajuda National Palace (Pal√°cio Nacional da Ajuda) in Lisbon. The present decoration is from the 19th century, with walls covered with crimson velvet, gold gilded French mirrors and a major Tabriz carpet from the 18th century in the precious wood floor. The ceiling is covered with M√°ximo dos Reis allegorical fresco and a huge crystal chandelier.http://www.pnajuda.imc-ip.pt/ The thrones are from Portuguese fabric, second half of the 18th century with the Portuguese coat of arms on the top handled by two angels.

This throne was in Silver-gilt, with winged dragons, the heraldic symbolf of the House of Braganza, and the arms of Portugal supported by two allegorical statues, Europe and America. The Throne room is still used for state events of the Portuguese Republic. PolandRoyal Castle, Warsaw= The Senators' Chamber is one of the most sumptuous rooms in the Castle. It was here that the Constitution was enacted on 3 May 1791. The interiors were destroyed after the fall of the November Uprising and it has now been reconstructed based on earlier drawings. The royal throne and fragments of the backdrop and canopy are original. The throne was reconstructed according to a design by Andrzej Grzybowski, and the painted decorations are the work of Andrzej Bertrandt. The armchairs and chairs for the senators and ministers have been arranged strictly according to the rules of etiquette governing the proceedings of the Polish Sejm (parliament).http://www.zamek-krolewski.pl/en/your-visit/the-interiors-of-the- castle-and-its-surroundings/the-sejm =Wawel Castle, Krak√≥w= The Senator's Hall, the largest room in the castle was originally designated for sessions of the Senate, important state and court ceremonies, royal weddings, theatre performances and balls. The first royal wedding, that of Sigismund I the Old to Bona Sworza, took place here in 1518. The walls are decorated with large figural tapestries with biblical themes from Sigismund Augustus‚Äô collection. A Classicist armchair has replaced the throne.https://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=6 RussiaPeterhof= Used by the Tsars of Russia, the dais and throne of the Peterhof Palace dominate the eastern wall with a large picture presenting Catherine II on her horse. The room also holds numerous oil paintings and eleven chandeliers. =Winter Palace= Regarded as the throne of Russia, the throne of St. George's Hall (or large throne room) is set atop the seven- stepped dais with a proscenium arch above and the symbol of the Imperial Family behind (the two-headed eagle). Peter I's Room (the smaller throne room) is modest in comparison to the former. The throne was made for Empress Anna Ivanovna in London and the picture behind displays Peter the Great with Minerva. SpainRoyal Palace of Madrid= The Palacio Real de Madrid (Royal Palace of Madrid) was the official residence of the Spanish monarch. The throne room is unique, as it retains the original decor from the days of Carlos III. The sumptuous room has gold garnishing with crimson-velvet wall coverings complemented by a Tiepolo ceiling, lit by a rock crystal chandelier. Adorning the room are huge mirrors made in the royal glass factory of La Granja. The Royal Family does not reside in the palace, instead choosing a smaller, more modest palace, the Palacio de la Zarzuela, on the outskirts of Madrid. However, the Palacio Real de Madrid remains the official residence of the Spanish monarchy and is used for state occasions. SwedenStockholm Palace= The Silver Throne in the Hall of State. The throne located in the Hall of State at the Stockholm Palace is called the Silver Throne and was commissioned for the coronation of Queen Kristina in 1650. It was last used by the present king, Carl XVI Gustaf, on his accession to the throne in 1973 and at the State Opening of Parliament in 1974. Throne in the Lovisa Ulrika audience chamber at Stockholm Palace. For the coronation of king Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrica in 1750 two coronation thrones were made. Both are placed at the Stockholm palace, and one is on display in the Lovisa Ulrica audience chamber. United KingdomBuckingham Palace= The throne room of Buckingham Palace, residence of the British Monarch in the capital city of London, is used for court gatherings and as a second dancing room. It is dominated by a proscenium arch supported by a pair of winged figures of 'victory' holding garlands above the two thrones, which are originals from the Queen's coronation in 1953. It is in the throne room that the Queen, on special occasions, receives loyal addresses. Another use of the throne room has been for formal wedding photographs. Apart from the Thrones in the room actually named Throne Room, there is also a pair of Thrones in the Buckingham Palace Ballroom, that is a larger multi-purpose hall within the Palace. The ballroom is also used for investiture ceremonies in the UK's honours system. =St James's Palace= Although British monarchs have resided in Buckingham Palace since the days of Queen Victoria, St. James's Palace remains the senior palace of the British monarchy.The Royal Residences > St James's Palace St James's remains a busy working palace, and also retains an important ceremonial function: it still is the place where the Accession Council customarily meets to proclaim the new sovereign and to receive from them the required oath. St. James's Throne Room is used for official occasions. For instance it is in this room that the lord mayor and councillors of the City of Westminster usually present an address of welcome to visiting heads of state on state visits. While the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace has two thrones, one for the reigning king or queen and another for the monarch's consort, the Throne Room at St. James's Palace contains only one throne, pertaining to the sovereign. As in the case of Buckingham Palace, the throne is placed under a canopy. The velvet cloth behind the throne is dominated by the coat of arms of the United Kingdom. This room was the setting for the announcement of the engagement of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton. =Palace of Westminster= Although the primary purpose and reputation of the Palace of Westminster is as the seat of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, it is also officially a royal residence. While the Palace has no throne room per se, the Lords Chamber contains at its head a throne, used by the monarch for addressing Parliament in the Speech from the Throne, arguably making the Chamber something of a throne room. Clerks and officers of the House of Lords bow to the throne when crossing the chamber. The Palace of Westminster also has a second throne under a canopy in the Robing Room, a room of the Palace that remains under the authority of the Crown (and not of either House of Parliament), under the direction of the Lord Great Chamberlain, and that is used by the monarch to robe and to unrobe before and after the State Opening of Parliament. =Windsor Castle= Windsor Castle has a Throne Room known as the Garter Throne Room, where the investiture of new Knights of the Garter takes place once a year. The room accommodates two rows of chairs for all Knights of the Garter, with the sovereign's Throne at the head.The current throne housed in the Garter Throne room is the Indian Throne, an elaborate throne carved from ivory which was gifted to Queen Victoria as the empress of India. =Colloquial usage= In British English, \\"throne room\\" is also used as a euphemism for \\"lavatory\\". IrelandDublin Castle= Throne Room in Dublin Castle, Ireland Located in the State Apartments, the Throne Room in Dublin Castle is preserved intact from the period when Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, when both Lords Lieutenant and visiting monarchs from Britain would use the room during important ceremonies held in the Castle. These included the investing of a new Lord Lieutenant every five years, the presentation of d√©butantes to the Lord Lieutenant during the Castle Season held leading up to St. Patrick's Day, and the presentation of subjects to visiting monarchs on official State visits to Ireland. The throne canopy dates to the late 18th century, while the throne was made for the visit of George IV to Ireland in 1821, and was last used by George V in 1911. The Throne Room no longer has any role in modern-day State ceremonial. However Dublin Castle still plays an important role in this respect, serving as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland every seven years. This takes place in the much larger and grander St. Patrick's Hall, the 18th century ballroom of the Viceregal Court, positioned almost adjacent to the Throne Room. Malaysia Malaysia's head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (commonly glossed as \\"King\\"), is a position rotated every five years among the nine royal houses of its nine hereditary states. Each has separate palaces and throne rooms for each of the individual states, while the King resides in the Istana Negara (National Palace) in Kuala Lumpur. This and the old palace both had throne rooms called the Balai Rong Seri (Royal Audience Hall), where several state ceremonies including the King's Installation occur.

All MEL engines had wedge-shaped combustion chambers formed between a flat head surface and an angle milled block deck (10 degrees off square with the bore axis), with the piston top determining the compression ratio and combustion chamber shape, similar to the Chevrolet Big-Block 348 combustion chamber, also introduced in 1958, and the later 409 and 427. Unlike the Chevrolet, which had staggered valves and scalloped or M shaped valve covers, the MEL valves were inline with shaft mounted rocker arms like the FE model Ford engines which were introduced at the same time. As with the previous generation V8s, an open runner intake manifold was used, requiring the use of a stamped steel lifter valley cover similar to that of the Pontiac V8 engines. Also, the intake manifold provided no exhaust crossover passage to warm the air-fuel mixture. Further MEL engines employed two individual thermostats, aimed to improve the regulation of the engine's coolant temperature. The MEL bore some mechanical similarities with the Ford FE, utilizing similar components such as the oiling system, bolt patterns, and valve stems; however, the MEL was a Lincoln-specific engine and was even larger in displacement capacity. The main bearings were , while the rod bearings were . The connecting rod beam had a unique triangular shape with the shoulders for the bolts sitting low toward the cap mating surface . There was one major difference between the MEL and FE engines besides their size and weight; the valves on MEL engines were arranged in alternating fashion (I-E-I- E-I-E-I-E) and not in the manner of the FE (E-I-E-I-I-E-I-E) where the I indicates an intake valve and the E indicates an exhaust valve. The MEL was one of three new engine families introduced by Lincoln and Ford in 1958. The others were the FE (Ford Edsel) and SD (super duty), the latter being large and extra powerful, slow-turning (revving) engines engineered for heavy-duty work trucks. The FE engine saw its use in the Edsel, a model which was introduced to the vehicle lineup by Ford, described as a car which blended design features of the Ford and Mercury lines combining them with its own individual styling. Further several new Lincoln vehicles, such as the Continental luxury sedan and coupe, as well as the all-new four-seat Thunderbird of the same year, which were brought to market utilizing the new engines. 383 The Marauder was the smallest member of the family. Produced from 1958 through 1960, it was only used in Mercury vehicles. It used a bore and stroke. Output began at , both with a four-barrel carburetor. The was the only output for 1959, and power dropped to for the final year. 410 The MEL engine was the only engine offered in the 1958 Edsel Citation and Corsair models. It was rated at and . Bore and stroke were 4.30 and 3.70 inches respectively. It was not an option on the Pacer, Ranger or station wagon models, which exclusively used the FE 361 engine. There were no other Ford Motor Company applications for this engine such as in Ford and Mercury cars and Ford Trucks. The MEL engine range also included 383 (exclusive to Mercury), 430 (Thunderbird, Mercury, Lincoln, Continental, and Lincoln Continental) and a engine that was exclusive to Lincoln Continentals. In 1965 Ford produced a 410 version of the FE engine that was exclusive to Mercury but there is no relation between the two engines other than displacement. 430 The engine was produced from 1958 through 1965. It was the standard engine on all 1958 to 1960 Lincolns and Continentals. Power was in 1958, in 1959, in 1960, in 1961 and in 1964. It was an optional engine on all Mercurys from 1958 to 1960 but Mercury models had a little less horsepower than the Lincolns and Continentals. The 430 was also an optional engine in 1959 and 1960 Ford Thunderbirds. It was commonly referred to as the \\"bulldozer\\" of the MEL series engines. The 1958 Super Marauder version used 3 two-barrel carburetors to generate , the first American production car to reach this figure. It was an option on all 430 equipped 1958 Mercurys and all 1958 Lincolns and Continentals. This engine featured the tripower intake manifold, which was cast for Ford by Moon products. Three Holley 2300 carburetors were used. The 430 had a 4.30 bore (same as the 383) and shared the stroke of the 410. The compression ratio started at 10.5:1 for , , and , but was reduced to 10.0:1 the following year. These 1959 engines produced , but power was down to for 1960. Some 1958 Continental Mark IIIs came brand new with the Holley 4150 four-barrel carburetor. New pistons and a four-barrel carburetor were added for 1963; the 10.1:1 compression brought output back to . The 430 engine in particular had a limited but storied history in hot-rodding. The first Miami to Nassau race won by Bertram Yachts (which subsequently helped establish their name) featured a boat powered by twin 430 MEL engines. In the 1959 NASCAR season, Holman Moody campaigned a number of Thunderbirds, at least some of which were powered by 430s. At least one car survives. The cars were ponderous handlers because of the heavy engine, but successful runners. The Holman Moody 430 Thunderbirds caught the attention of Ford after one of them, driven by Johnny Beauchamp, finished a close second to Lee Petty at the 1959 Daytona 500. Houston's Rodney Singer and crew chief Karol Miller used a GMC supercharged Lincoln-powered dragster to win the 1959 NHRA Nationals Top Eliminator. Theirs was the first supercharged TE in NHRA history, starting a string which has continued through the present. Because of the changing nature of heads, intakes and piston designs, as well as a limited life span, not many aftermarket speed parts were made for the MEL line of engines. Edelbrock made a 6X2 intake manifold and a set of water-cooled marine exhaust manifolds (M4) and Weiand made a drag start 8X2 manifold as well. Oversize pistons for early drag racers or blown 430s were made, including sets by Jahns Pistons at 13:1 and over standard bore. Other speed parts have been rumored, but they are difficult to find. 462 The 430 was replaced by the engine in 1966. Bore and stroke were entirely different at 4.38 and the 462 MEL engine produced and as much as of torque. This engine was fitted with hydraulic lifters and a four-barrel Carter AFB carburetor. This large torquey engine was used only in Lincoln Continentals, from 1966 until mid-year in 1968 when it was replaced by the 385-series 460. Production ended after 1968. The production facilities in Lima were converted to produce the new Ford 385 engine family.

Set in the near future, its premise is that human boxing has been banned and replaced by android boxing. The story follows a once-famous human boxer who works as a manager for an antiquated android while struggling to come to grips with his career having been taken over by machines. The episode is based on the 1956 short story by Richard Matheson. Opening narrationPlot This episode is set in August 1974, almost eleven years in the future at the time that this episode was made. As boxing between human fighters was criminalized in 1968, the sport is dominated by fighting robots. Former boxer Steel Kelly (played by Lee Marvin) manages a B2-model robot called \\"Battling Maxo\\". Maxo is an older model that is no longer in demand. Kelly and his partner, Pole, have used the last of their money to get to the fight venue. They are being given this chance because one of the scheduled fighters was damaged in transport. Kelly has to assure the fight promoter that Maxo will be able to fight. After the fight promoter leaves, Kelly and Pole argue about Maxo's fitness. Kelly feels that Maxo should be able to go through with the fight despite its age and condition. Pole tests Maxo's functions and an arm spring fails. They do not have the parts or the money to fix him. Kelly decides that he will disguise himself as Maxo in order to collect the money necessary for repairs. Despite a valiant effort, he is unable to damage the B7 robot he is fighting, even when he lands an unblocked punch directly in the back of its head. He is nearly killed but manages to last a little under three minutes. The crowd jeers and boos at Maxo's performance, not knowing that it is a human doing the fighting. Afterwards, the fight promoter will only give them half the prize money because of \\"Maxo's\\" poor performance; Kelly dares not protest, or the promoter will recognize him as \\"Maxo\\" and renege entirely. Kelly, bruised but stubborn as ever, tells Pole that they will use the money to get the parts to fix Maxo. Closing narrationProduction notes This was the first episode sponsored by Procter & Gamble (alternating sponsorship with American Tobacco), who usually \\"pitched\\" Crest toothpaste, Lilt Home Permanent, and Prell shampoo, among their other products. Serling was not required to endorse any of P&G;'s products at the end of their episodes. Serling, in his narration, had predicted that professional boxing would be outlawed within five years of the episode's airing; at the time, the sport was mired in controversy after Emile Griffith killed his opponent Benny Paret in a nationally televised and particularly brutal 1962 match. With Paret's death at Griffith's hands, as well as the death of Davey Moore from an inadvertent neck injury sustained in a March 1963 contest, the specter of the sport being outlawed was a realistic possibility at the time \\"Steel\\" was broadcast. Serling's prediction did not come to fruition; although boxing declined in popularity in the succeeding years, it has never been outlawed.

A flagon is typically of about in volume, and it has either a handle (when strictly it is a jug), or (more usually) one or two rings at the neck. Sometimes the neck has a large flange at the top rather than rings. The neck itself may or may not be formed into one, two or three spouts. The name comes from the same origin as the word \\"flask\\". Christian use As a Roman Catholic term of use, the flagon is the large vessel, usually glass and metal, that holds the wine. Before March 2002, a flagon may have also been used to hold the wine during the consecration of the Eucharist and then be poured into many chalices. This pouring of sacramental wine from flagon to chalice was eliminated. A smaller container called a cruet is used for the priest's chalice, usually identical to the cruet of water, which is mingled with the wine before consecration. The cruets do not remain on the altar after the preparation of the gifts. In the Anglican Church, the flagon is the vessel that contains the wine to be consecrated. If more than one chalice is used during the administration of Communion, the flagon (or an additional cruet filled with wine and water) is placed on the altar at the Offertory, and other chalices are brought to the altar after the Breaking of the Bread. There should be only one chalice on the altar during the Great Thanksgiving. New Zealand In New Zealand, a flagon refers to a glass vessel filled with beer available in public bars or bottle stores. Drinkers could take their own washed flagons or swap their empties for those pre-filled, corked, and ready for sale. The flagon was followed by the half-gallon (2.27 l) jar and was preceded by the square rigger and the bluey. These were commonly used during the period of six-o'clock closing of bars. A flagon can hold different volumes of beer or wine and is thought to have originated from an amendment to the licensing laws, which took effect in 1881. The amendment allowed winemakers to sell wine from their vineyards for off-license consumption, so long as the quantity was 2 gallons (9 liters) or more (hence the \\"2 g\\" flagon). Before this change winemakers could only sell wine from hotels. A half-gallon flagon was a common volume used for beer. Ireland In modern Ireland, a flagon usually refers to a two-litre bottle of cider.

The novel's narrator is Ovid, the Roman poet, and this apocryphal work is rather similar to Marguerite Yourcenar's M√©moires d'Hadrien in which Yourcenar writes the Roman emperor Hadrian's m√©moires. In God Was Born in Exile, \\"Ovid\\" covers the last eight years of his life, when he was exiled to Tomis, an Ancient Roman colony in Scythia Minor. This novel adopts the form of a diary, divided into eight chapters (each of which corresponds to a year of exile) that reveal the steps of a progressive \\"maturation,\\" or a conversion of sorts. The novel's universe is linked together around a primordial axis whose two poles are Roman society and the Dacian world, respectively. This dichotomy generates a rich range of metaphors, but perhaps this novel's most important attribute is the way in which both worlds are constructed, and their importance as \\"chronotopes\\" in the narrative. Ovid's spiritual journey resolves itself between both symbolic universes whose antagonistic characters become interwoven during a chiasm, in order to rise up again at the end of the radically metamorphized narration.

Many of the structures are included in the Federal Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Other structures are included in the Federal Hill South Historic District, listed in 2003. Location The neighborhood is named for the prominent hill that is easily viewed from the Inner Harbor area, to which the neighborhood forms the physical south boundary. The hillside is a lush green and serves as a community park. The neighborhood occupies the northwestern part of a peninsula that extends along two branches of the Patapsco River--the Northwest Branch (ending at the Inner Harbor) and the Middle Branch. This peninsula is generally referred to as the South Baltimore Peninsula, and includes the neighborhoods of Federal Hill, Locust Point, Riverside, South Baltimore, and Sharp-Leadenhall. While not physically a part of the peninsula, Otterbein is also included in the collection of neighborhoods which make up greater South Baltimore. Traditionally, Federal Hill was roughly triangular, bordered by Hanover Street to the west; Hughes Street, the harbor, and Key Highway to the north and east; and Cross Street to the south. Amenities The Cross Street Market, a historic marketplace built in the 19th century, continues to serve residents and is the primary social and commercial hub for the neighborhood. As of late 2016, the City of Baltimore has entered into an agreement with Caves Valley Partners to renovate Cross Street Market. The multimillion-dollar rebuild is anticipated to break ground during Spring 2017. The primary business district is bounded by Montgomery, Ostend, Light, Charles and Hanover Streets, and is home to a large number of restaurants of a wide range of taste, quality, and price, and many small shops as well as a few larger, more practical stores. The neighborhood is a popular destination for tavern goers and music lovers, with street festivals several times a year. These are organized through a very active neighborhood organization and business organization, as is the annual Shakespeare on the Hill series of summer performances in the park atop the actual Federal Hill. The neighborhood is also home to the American Visionary Art Museum and Maryland Science Center. Significant and historic houses of worship include Christ Lutheran Church, Church of the Advent-Episcopal, Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church, Light Street Presbyterian Church, Lee Street Baptist Church, Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, and St. Mary's Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church. Federal Hill is served by Federal Hill Elementary School, Thomas Johnson Elementary Middle School, Francis Scott Key Elementary and Middle School, and Digital Harbor High School. The public library is the Light Street Branch of the famous Enoch Pratt Free Library. Federal Hill is also home to many popular retail, dining, and entertainment options all within walking distance for most neighborhood residents. With most daily needs covered by businesses within a few blocks of the community center, Federal Hill has emerged as a premier neighborhood for the increasing number of people choosing an urban lifestyle. Transportation Federal Hill is located conveniently to Interstate 95, Interstate 395, the Baltimore- Washington Parkway, and Charles and Light Streets, which provide the major north-south surface route through Baltimore. The western portions of the neighborhood are within walking distance of the Hamburg Street and Camden Yards stops on the Baltimore Light Rail. The Charm City Circulator is a free bus system that services central Baltimore and consists of four separate routes. Two of the routes, the Purple Route which runs from Penn Station to Federal Hill, and the Banner Route which runs from the Inner Harbor to Fort McHenry, service Federal Hill. Early history Early in the colonial period the area known as Federal Hill was the site of a paint pigment mining operation. The hill has several tunnels beneath its present parklike setting. On occasion a part of a tunnel will collapse causing the need to infill the area if the depression is near the surface of the edges of the hill. From early in the history of the city, the hill was a public gathering place and civic treasure. The hill itself was given the name in 1789 after serving as the location for the end of a parade and a following civic celebration of the ratification of the new \\"Federal\\" constitution of the United States of America. For much of the early history of Baltimore, the hill was known as Signal Hill because it was home to a maritime observatory serving the merchant and shipping interests of the city by observing the sailing of ships up the Patapsco River and signalling their impending arrival to downtown businesspeople. On the night of May 12, following the Baltimore riot of 1861, the hill was occupied in the middle of the night by a thousand Union troops and a battery under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler, who had entered the city, under cover of darkness and during a thunderstorm, from Annapolis via the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.Allan Nevins, The War for the Union: The Improvised War, 1861‚Äì1862 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), p. 87. During the night, Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the United States government (with the implicit threat of force, should it have been necessary). This fort and the Union army presence persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannons, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history. Recent history In the 20th century, Federal Hill was a working-class neighborhood, and by the late 1970s was yet another struggling Baltimore inner city neighborhood, with increasing crime, racial tension, depressed property values, and an aging and decaying housing stock. Many of the industrial jobs, particularly in the shipyards and factories along the south shore of the Patapsco River, which had long provided the main source of employment for neighborhood residents were in the process of disappearing. The Bethlehem Steel shipyards on the east side of the hill were one of the last to close, in the early 1980s. The nationally recognized urban homesteading program in nearby Otterbein, begun in 1975, helped spur interest among individuals and businesses in rehabilitating homes in Federal Hill, and it soon became a hotbed of investment and rehabilitation, particularly by young professional baby boomers who had grown up in the suburbs but worked downtown. The investment and growth throughout downtown and especially at the Inner Harbor through the 1980s and 1990s only increased the popularity of Federal Hill living over the decades following the initial reinvestment period. A second period of intense investment and rising property values began in the mid 1990s. This second stage of neighborhood investment has included not just single-family home rehabilitation but increasingly large development projects on former industrial sites, particularly on the edges of the neighborhood around the water's edge. Within the core of the neighborhood itself, there has been an influx of new restaurants and shops. The city's population grew 0.6% in 2006 for the first time since the 1950s with much of the growth focused in Federal Hill. Streets that used to have vacant houses on every block have now been fully renovated. Many families have moved into these houses. Panorama of the Inner Harbor taken at night from Federal Hill Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,400 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Federal Hill was 87.3% White, 9.0% African American, 0.2% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.6% from other races, and 1.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.3% of the population. 55.6% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 8.8% of housing units were vacant. 82.5% of the population is employed and 4.0% is unemployed, with the remainder not in the labor force. The median household income was $62,466. About 1.0% of families and 7.0% of the population were below the poverty line. 21.8% of Federal Hill residents walked to work.

In 1968, with his wife, Louise Huber, he founded Astrological Psychology Institute, which became an internationally renowned school of Astrology. It was run according to humanist and psychological principles, based on Dr. Roberto Assagioli's theory of Psychosynthesis. The school initially offered personal teaching, and then professional Diploma training from 1973. Huber schools were subsequently established in UK and Spain. The Hubers‚Äô teachings were gradually crystallised into books, which have subsequently been translated into many languages. Their holistic method of Astrological Psychology has a worldwide following. Early life and marriage The young Bruno Huber had a voracious interest in astrology, psychology and philosophy, but became disillusioned with the practice of astrology at that time. In 1952 he met astrologer and esotericist Louise, discovering an immediate common bond. They married a year later and lived in Z√ºrich. Astrological career In 1956 they were involved for two years with setting up a branch of the Arcane School in Geneva. In Florence In 1958, Huber was invited to Roberto Assagioli‚Äôs Psychosynthesis Institute in Florence, which led to the pair spending three years there assisting with running of the Institute and the documentation of Assagioli's psychosynthesis. During this period Bruno was able to perform extensive research into the horoscopes and psychological profiles of Assagioli's patients, and eventually he developed theories on horoscope interpretation that became the basis for Astrological Psychology, or Huber Astrology. Work in Z√ºrich In 1963, the couple returned to Z√ºrich. In 1968, Huber and his wife Louise began to give seminars on the results of their researches, and the Astrological Psychology Institute was founded. A following soon developed in Zurich, and the teaching activities developed apace, going further afield in Switzerland and Germany, and then at international conferences, and in USA, UK, Spain and Brazil. By the early 2000s tens of thousands of students had been through the courses, and equivalent courses were available in Spain and in UK. The Hubers were also heavily involved in organising and presenting at three-yearly World Astrology Conferences in Switzerland. Publications In 1974 Huber formed a publishing company was formed, and a series of books gradually emerged; most have subsequently been published in English and in Spanish. The astrological psychology magazine Astrolog was established in 1981 and continues to this day. Health decline and death In 1991 Huber had a heart attack, though he continued working.

The school was renamed St. Patrick's High School, a full fledged secondary school in 1986. St. Patrick's High School remained at the 1485 Heron Road site until 1993. In 1988, it moved to 2525 Alta Vista Drive, previously the location of the former Charlebois High School of the French Catholic School Board.Historical Profile - St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa) In World War II (1939‚Äì45) 86 former students of St. Patrick's gave their lives in service.Historical Profile - St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa) In 1968 St. Patrick's College became affiliated with Carleton University. St. Patrick's College High School relocated to the Campanile Campus at 1485 Heron Road, where St. Patrick's shared the location with Notre Dame High School, run by the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame. In 1968, the school change its name from St. Patrick's College High School to St. Patrick's High School. In September 1989, the ‚ÄúSt. Pat‚Äôs Fighting Irish‚Äù hit the field for the first time since 1975, defeating Laurentian High School in the process. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2004. To mark the occasion, a video was produced by Roy Ketcheson.Historical Profile - St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa) Dress Code The student dress code at St. Patrick's High School consists of black dress pants, white dress shirt or polo shirt with the St. Patrick's name, green plaid kilt or black skirt, green sweat shirt with plaid letter ‚ÄúP,‚Äù green cardigan or pullover with St. Patrick's crest, green blazer with St. Pat's crest, green rugby shirt with St. Pat's and the letter ‚ÄúP.‚Äù St. Patrick's student ambassadors, who are senior students, wear green blazers with the school crest.Historical Profile - St. Patrick's High School (Ottawa) Principals *Albert Meereboer, O.M.I.

It is concerned with generalizations of the concept of holomorphic function to functions defined and taking values in complex Banach spaces (or Fr√©chet spaces more generally), typically of infinite dimension. It is one aspect of nonlinear functional analysis. Vector-valued holomorphic functions defined in the complex plane A first step in extending the theory of holomorphic functions beyond one complex dimension is considering so-called vector-valued holomorphic functions, which are still defined in the complex plane C, but take values in a Banach space. Such functions are important, for example, in constructing the holomorphic functional calculus for bounded linear operators. > Definition. A function f : U ‚Üí X, where U ‚äÇ C is an open subset and X is a > complex Banach space is called holomorphic if it is complex-differentiable; > that is, for each point z ‚àà U the following limit exists: > :f'(z)=\\\\lim_{\\\\zeta\\\\to z} \\\\frac{f(\\\\zeta)-f(z)}{\\\\zeta - z}. One may define the line integral of a vector-valued holomorphic function f : U ‚Üí X along a rectifiable curve Œ≥ : [a, b] ‚Üí U in the same way as for complex- valued holomorphic functions, as the limit of sums of the form :\\\\sum_{1 \\\\le k \\\\le n} f(\\\\gamma(t_k)) ( \\\\gamma(t_k) - \\\\gamma(t_{k-1}) ) where a = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = b is a subdivision of the interval [a, b], as the lengths of the subdivision intervals approach zero. It is a quick check that the Cauchy integral theorem also holds for vector-valued holomorphic functions. Indeed, if f : U ‚Üí X is such a function and T : X ‚Üí C a bounded linear functional, one can show that :T\\\\left(\\\\int_\\\\gamma f(z)\\\\,dz\\\\right)=\\\\int_\\\\gamma (T\\\\circ f)(z)\\\\,dz. Moreover, the composition T o f : U ‚Üí C is a complex-valued holomorphic function. Therefore, for Œ≥ a simple closed curve whose interior is contained in U, the integral on the right is zero, by the classical Cauchy integral theorem. Then, since T is arbitrary, it follows from the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem that :\\\\int_\\\\gamma f(z)\\\\,dz=0 which proves the Cauchy integral theorem in the vector-valued case. Using this powerful tool one may then prove Cauchy's integral formula, and, just like in the classical case, that any vector-valued holomorphic function is analytic. A useful criterion for a function f : U ‚Üí X to be holomorphic is that T o f : U ‚Üí C is a holomorphic complex-valued function for every continuous linear functional T : X ‚Üí C. Such an f is weakly holomorphic. It can be shown that a function defined on an open subset of the complex plane with values in a Fr√©chet space is holomorphic if, and only if, it is weakly holomorphic. Holomorphic functions between Banach spaces More generally, given two complex Banach spaces X and Y and an open set U ‚äÇ X, f : U ‚Üí Y is called holomorphic if the Fr√©chet derivative of f exists at every point in U. One can show that, in this more general context, it is still true that a holomorphic function is analytic, that is, it can be locally expanded in a power series. It is no longer true however that if a function is defined and holomorphic in a ball, its power series around the center of the ball is convergent in the entire ball; for example, there exist holomorphic functions defined on the entire space which have a finite radius of convergence. Holomorphic functions between topological vector spaces In general, given two complex topological vector spaces X and Y and an open set U ‚äÇ X, there are various ways of defining holomorphy of a function f : U ‚Üí Y. Unlike the finite dimensional setting, when X and Y are infinite dimensional, the properties of holomorphic functions may depend on which definition is chosen. To restrict the number of possibilities we must consider, we shall only discuss holomorphy in the case when X and Y are locally convex. This section presents a list of definitions, proceeding from the weakest notion to the strongest notion. It concludes with a discussion of some theorems relating these definitions when the spaces X and Y satisfy some additional constraints. Gateaux holomorphy Gateaux holomorphy is the direct generalization of weak holomorphy to the fully infinite dimensional setting. Let X and Y be locally convex topological vector spaces, and U ‚äÇ X an open set. A function f : U ‚Üí Y is said to be G√¢teaux holomorphic if, for every a ‚àà U and b ‚àà X, and every continuous linear functional œÜ : Y ‚Üí C, the function :f_{\\\\varphi}(z) = \\\\varphi\\\\circ f(a+zb) is a holomorphic function of z in a neighborhood of the origin. The collection of G√¢teaux holomorphic functions is denoted by HG(U,Y). In the analysis of Gateaux holomorphic functions, any properties of finite- dimensional holomorphic functions hold on finite-dimensional subspaces of X. However, as usual in functional analysis, these properties may not piece together uniformly to yield any corresponding properties of these functions on full open sets. =Examples= *If f ‚àà U, then f has Gateaux derivatives of all orders, since for x ‚àà U and h1, ..., hk ‚àà X, the k-th order Gateaux derivative Dkf(x){h1, ..., hk} involves only iterated directional derivatives in the span of the hi, which is a finite-dimensional space. In this case, the iterated Gateaux derivatives are multilinear in the hi, but will in general fail to be continuous when regarded over the whole space X. *Furthermore, a version of Taylor's theorem holds: ::f(x+y)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\widehat{D}^nf(x)(y) :Here, \\\\widehat{D}^nf(x)(y) is the homogeneous polynomial of degree n in y associated with the multilinear operator Dnf(x). The convergence of this series is not uniform. More precisely, if V ‚äÇ X is a fixed finite-dimensional subspace, then the series converges uniformly on sufficiently small compact neighborhoods of 0 ‚àà Y. However, if the subspace V is permitted to vary, then the convergence fails: it will in general fail to be uniform with respect to this variation. Note that this is in sharp contrast with the finite dimensional case. *Hartog's theorem holds for Gateaux holomorphic functions in the following sense: > If f : (U ‚äÇ X1) √ó (V ‚äÇ X2) ‚Üí Y is a function which is separately Gateaux > holomorphic in each of its arguments, then f is Gateaux holomorphic on the > product space. Hypoanalyticity A function f : (U ‚äÇ X) ‚Üí Y is hypoanalytic if f ‚àà HG(U,Y) and in addition f is continuous on relatively compact subsets of U. Holomorphy A function f ‚àà HG(U,Y) is holomorphic if, for every x ‚àà U, the Taylor series expansion :f(x+y)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\widehat{D}^nf(x)(y) (which is already guaranteed to exist by Gateaux holomorphy) converges and is continuous for y in a neighborhood of 0 ‚àà X. Thus holomorphy combines the notion of weak holomorphy with the convergence of the power series expansion. The collection of holomorphic functions is denoted by H(U,Y). Locally bounded holomorphy A function f : (U ‚äÇ X) ‚Üí Y is said to be locally bounded if each point of U has a neighborhood whose image under f is bounded in Y. If, in addition, f is Gateaux holomorphic on U, then f is locally bounded holomorphic. In this case, we write f ‚àà HLB(U,Y).  References  * Richard V. Kadison, John R.

He was the nephew of Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, with whom Anne Boleyn had a romantic association before she became the wife of King Henry VIII. When Thomas was eight years old his father, Sir Thomas Percy, was executed at Tyburn (2 June 1537) for having taken a leading part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, and he also is considered a martyr by many.

In reward he was granted the title of Earl of Northumberland and the Baronies of Percy, Poynings, Lucy, Bryan, and Fitzpane were restored to him, on 1 May 1557. He was installed at Whitehall with great pomp, and soon after was named Warden General of the Marches, in which capacity he fought and defeated the Scots. Life under Elizabeth's Reign On Queen Elizabeth I's accession the earl, whose loyalty to the Catholic Church was known, was kept in the North while the anti-Catholic measures of Elizabeth's first Parliament were passed. Elizabeth continued to show him favour, and in 1563 gave him the Order of the Garter. He had then resigned the wardenship and was living in the South. But the systematic persecution of the Catholics rendered their position most difficult, and in the autumn of 1569 the Catholic gentry in the North, stirred up by rumours of the approaching excommunication of Elizabeth, were planning to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, possibly with a view putting her on the English throne, and to obtain liberty of worship. Earl Thomas with the Earl of Westmorland wrote to the pope asking for advice, but before their letter reached Rome circumstances hurried them into action against their better judgment.

Franco and his colleagues suggest the \\"Polymeal\\" as a natural alternative to the \\"Polypill\\", a multi- drug-based strategy for reducing heart disease. The researchers used the same technique in the polypill paper: a statistical \\"meta-analysis\\" which combined the results of many previous studies. The paper, appearing in the BMJ's traditionally light-hearted Christmas issue, may be regarded as somewhat satirical, as noted in responses in the journal. The study claims that adherence to the polymeal diet would delay the average onset of heart attack by nine years among men and by eight years among women. Because cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in first-world nations, this delay of heart failure would increase the average lifespan of men by six years and women by 5.5 years. The researchers combined several food items already known to reduce the risk of heart disease: * Red wine, which contains the antioxidant resveratrol, and alcohol, which some researchers think may help to reduce atherosclerosis by reducing clotting. * Dark chocolate without dairy products * Almonds * Garlic * Fish, particularly oily fish, which are sources of the Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. * Fruits and vegetables They suggest a person should consume, every day: * 150 mL of red wine (about one glass) * 100 g of dark chocolate * 400 g of fruits and vegetables * 2.7 g of garlic * 68 g of almonds as well as 118 g of fish per day four times each week. Since the Polymeal is based on principles of combating inflammation, this diet could be extended to the following foods: * fruits and vegetables (as the staple) * ginger root * potatoes * fish (other than catfish and tilapia) * grass-fed beef (as opposed to grain-fed) * chicken and eggs * herbs and spices * olive oil * butter (ghee) * coconut oil * nuts * dark chocolate (at least 85% chocolate) * much water * green tea * red wine (dry and aged) * turmeric (Curcuma longa) Academic references * Franco OH, Bonneux L, de Laet C, Peeters A, Steyerberg EW, Mackenbach JP.

He was chosen as a consensus All-American in 2000 while playing college football for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Philadelphia Eagles selected him in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft, and he spent four seasons as a member of the Eagles, culminating in an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX following the 2004 NFL season. A four-sport athlete at Kathleen High School, Mitchell committed to UCLA to play football for the Bruins. In his collegiate debut in 1998, he had four receptions for 108 yards, including a 79-yard touchdown from Cade McNown, as well as a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon. Mitchell broke his femur the following week against Houston and missed most of the season. Limited by a knee cartilage injury throughout the 1999 season, he finished with 38 receptions for 533 yards. As a junior in 2000, Mitchell was a Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) honors at the conclusion of the season. In the 2000 Sun Bowl, he had nine catches for a Sun Bowl record of 180 yards. He declared for the 2001 NFL Draft following the 2000 season and finished his college career with 77 catches for 1,494 yards and nine touchdowns. Mitchell was drafted by the Eagles with the 25th selection in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He began the 2001 season as the fourth wide receiver, but surpassed Na Brown to become the team's slot receiver in week eight. When the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman before the 2002 season, Mitchell became the fourth receiver again and caught twelve passes the entire year. Mitchell became the slot receiver once again during the 2003 season, after Freeman left. In the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Green Bay Packers, with the Eagles facing a 4th and 26 situation, he caught a 28-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to help lead the team to a win in overtime. He finished the 2003 season with a career-high 35 catches for 498 yards and two touchdowns. The presence of Terrell Owens in 2004 led to limited opportunities for Mitchell to catch passes and he showed his frustration on and off the field. When Owens went down with an ankle injury towards the end of the season, Mitchell replaced him as the starter and had a two-touchdown performance in the Divisional Playoff Game against the Minnesota Vikings. After the game, Mitchell said, \\"I just want to thank my hands for being so great.\\" In the week prior to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, he created controversy by offending members of the Patriots' secondary, including Rodney Harrison. He caught one pass for 11 yards in the Super Bowl and was released by the Eagles on May 6, 2005. The Kansas City Chiefs signed him shortly after, but he declined to have arthroscopic surgery on his injured knee and he was released before the start of the season. After his NFL career ended, Mitchell bought a barbecue restaurant in Lakeland in 2008, but the venue was closed in September 2009. Mitchell served time in prison for tax fraud from 2013 to 2016. Early years Mitchell grew up as the son of a pastor in Lakeland, Florida. He attended Kathleen High School in Lakeland, where he lettered in cross country, baseball, football, and basketball. In baseball, Mitchell was used as a pinch hitter and played outfielder. He played in the Polk County East‚ÄìWest Senior All-Star Game in 1997 for the West squad. He had a .388 batting average, three home runs, and eleven runs batted in (RBI). Mitchell was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 47th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft after graduating from Kathleen. He had brief contract negotiations with the Devil Rays, but decided to attend college instead of signing with a professional team. He was a guard in basketball, and scored 11 points in the 1997 Class 4A boys' high school basketball state championship for Kathleen as the Red Devils won their first ever title. Mitchell, who had three steals in the game, was called for a technical foul after he went out-of-bounds and punched a cooler. In football, he contributed as a wide receiver, kick returner, punt returner, holder for kicker Paul Edinger, and defensive back. Mitchell earned The Ledger second-team all-Lakeland area honors as a utility player following the 1995 season. Mitchell visited the University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of Miami, and Michigan State University before he committed to the University of California, Los Angeles to play football for the Bruins. He chose to play on the West Coast mainly because of the opportunities presented for his career after football. College career While attending the University of California, Los Angeles, Mitchell played for the UCLA Bruins football team from 1997 to 2000. He sat out the 1997 season by taking a redshirt and subsequently lengthening his college football eligibility. In his first game, a 49‚Äì31 win over Texas on September 12, 1998, Mitchell threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon and had four catches for 108 yards and one touchdown pass (79 yards) from quarterback Cade McNown. He had one rushing attempt for 30 yards on a reverse, 78 yards on three kickoff returns, and 17 yards on three punt returns. He was named the Pacific-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts in the game. On September 19, Mitchell had surgery on his left femur after suffering a fracture at the end of a kickoff return in the first quarter of a 42‚Äì24 win over Houston the same day. Mitchell was expected to miss the rest of the season. However, after a \\"remarkable\\" recovery, according to a member of the UCLA medical staff, Mitchell was able to play for eleven snaps in the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1999. He threw a 61-yard touchdown pass to Durell Price on a flea flicker play in the first quarter of the loss to Wisconsin. In the summer prior to the 1999 season, Mitchell and Poli-Dixon trained with Minnesota Vikings receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter in Florida. Mitchell, Poli-Dixon, Danny Farmer, and the rest of the UCLA receiving corps called themselves \\"The Birds\\" for their ability to \\"fly all over the field.\\" Mitchell was hampered by a knee cartilage issue throughout his redshirt sophomore season. In his first career start, replacing the injured Farmer in the season-opener against Boise State, Mitchell had one catch for 11 yards from Drew Bennett, one kickoff return for 15 yards, and four punt returns for 33 yards. In the next week in a loss against the Ohio State Buckeyes, Mitchell again started in place of Farmer and gained 31 yards on two reverses, had four kickoff returns for 73 yards and completed a pass for 18 yards. In a 35‚Äì21 win over Fresno State on September 18, Mitchell, again starting in place of Farmer, caught nine passes for 149 yards, both career-highs. Mitchell caught 10 passes for 103 total yards in the next four games. He led the team in receiving for three consecutive weeks to follow: in his sixth start of the season, a 55‚Äì7 blowout loss to Oregon State, he caught five passes for 58 yards; in the Bruins' third-straight loss, this time to Arizona, he had 42 yards on four receptions; and in a 23‚Äì20 win in overtime against Washington, he successfully received four passes for 82 yards, including a 43-yard pass from Ryan McCann. In the final game of the season, against USC, Mitchell caught five passes for 88 yards. He had a total of 38 catches for 533 yards with no touchdowns and six starts in 1999, and finished 15th in the Pac-10 in receptions with 3.5 per game and 17th in receiving yards with 48.5 per game. Mitchell played baseball for the Bruins in the offseason prior to the 2000 football season. He was teammates with future Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Chase Utley and introduced Utley to his future wife, Jennifer Cooper. Mitchell was drafted in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft in the 50th round by the Chicago White Sox. Utley said of Mitchell's decision not to play baseball professionally, \\"he chose the right sport in football, that's for sure. He was a good batting practice hitter‚Äîthat's about it. He wasn't quite the same once the game got going.\\" The Bruins earned the Pac-10 Conference Championship with Mitchell as a member in 2000. Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from The Sporting News and Lindy's Sports before the 2000 season as he prepared to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer's graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the best wide receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season- opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91 yards in the upset win. In the 24‚Äì21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58 yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell's catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137 yards in the 23‚Äì20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, in the third quarter of a 29‚Äì10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that \\"I knew it was a touchdown, you knew it was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref[eree] knew it too because he looked at me like he was sorry.\\" On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158 yards. In a 38‚Äì31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80 yards, and had four total catches for 125 yards in the game. On October 14, in a triple-overtime loss to California, Mitchell made eight receptions for 167 yards and caught a 35-yard touchdown from Paus in the fourth quarter. Mitchell was named to the BCSfootball.com Midseason All-America team after posting 38 receptions for 736 yards and six touchdowns midway through the season. Over the next four games, Mitchell recorded 26 catches for 438 yards, including a seven-catch, 185-yard game against Stanford on November 4. He caught a 41-yard touchdown pass from Paus in the game. In a 38‚Äì35 loss to USC on November 18, Mitchell broke Farmer's single-season record of 1,274 yards in 1998 with 1,314 yards. He made four receptions for 140 yards and a four-yard touchdown in the game, and threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon. Mitchell was named a semi-finalist for the Biletnikoff Award in late October. He was named a finalist for the award in late November alongside Antonio Bryant of Pittsburgh and Marvin Minnis of Florida State, but lost out to Bryant. Mitchell earned first-team All-America honors by the Walter Camp Football Foundation following the season, as well as first-team All-Pac-10 honors. He earned CNNSI.com honorable mention All- America honors. He was named a winner of UCLA's Henry R. \\"Red\\" Sanders Award for Most Valuable Player, the winner of the George W. Dickerson Award for Outstanding Offensive Player against USC, and a winner of the Team Captain Award at the UCLA football award banquet. In the 2000 Sun Bowl against Wisconsin on December 29, Mitchell made nine receptions for a Sun Bowl-record 180 yards, including a 64-yard touchdown catch. Though the Bruins lost the game 21‚Äì20, Mitchell said Badgers cornerback Jamar Fletcher \\"couldn't stop [him].\\" Mitchell was called for two taunting penalties on Fletcher, but still won MVP honors following the game. Mitchell finished the season with 77 catches for 1,494 yards and nine touchdowns. In October 2000, Mitchell told the Eugene Register-Guard, a newspaper in Eugene, Oregon, that he was \\"definitely returning\\" for his senior season. By mid-November, however, he told the Associated Press that he was \\"leaning to staying, but nothing's firm.\\" Mitchell instead chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NFL Draft in early January 2001. He stated, \\"I have had a great time, but it's time for me to give something back to my family.\\" Mitchell said he would be quieter in the NFL: \\"You won't hear no more trash talking from Freddie Mitchell, those are the big boys, I'm just a little kid again. I'm humble.\\" He had 119 catches for 2,135 yards and 10 touchdowns in his career as a Bruin. Professional career=Pre-draft After Mitchell declared for the 2001 NFL Draft, one NFL scout told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel in February, \\"I don't think he's as fast as people in the press try to say he is. He's absolutely fearless over the middle but he prefers to trap the ball instead of to extend for it. I don't think he has nearly the explosion to be considered a first.\\" Mitchell was also criticized by scouts for his small frame and potential character issues. Draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. rated Mitchell as the 16th-best prospect in the draft following the NFL Scouting Combine in which he ran a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, and called him a player on the rise. Kiper also rated him as the fifth-best wide receiver in the draft and projected Mitchell to be drafted in the mid-first round following his performance at the Combine. In rating players several times leading up to the draft, Kiper re-watched game film of each player and adjusted their rankings accordingly. In his March 5 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the tenth overall selection. He ranked Mitchell as the 18th-best player in the draft on March 30. NFLDraftScout.com projected Mitchell to be drafted in the second round and rated him as the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft. Kiper ranked him the fourth-best wide receiver in the draft on April 2. In his April 10 mock draft, Kiper projected Mitchell to be drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 24th overall selection. Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranked Mitchell as the sixth-best wide receiver in the draft. Mitchell hired Tom Condon of IMG Football as his agent leading up to the draft. Philadelphia Eagles Mitchell in a 2004 preseason game =2001 season= Mitchell was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round (25th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. He was the fifth wide receiver taken in the draft. He worked out with his new quarterback Donovan McNabb in Arizona and Los Angeles before mini-camp started. Because of NCAA rules regarding graduation, Mitchell was unable to attend the Eagles' mini-camp until after UCLA's senior class graduated. He studied the Eagles' playbook in the meantime. He asked the NFL for an exemption, but the league refused, and he arrived for his first practice on June 18, 2001. Mitchell signed a five-year, $5.5 million contract with the Eagles on July 26, in time for the start of training camp. During training camp, Mitchell practiced as a backup behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. Special teams coordinator John Harbaugh asked Mitchell if he was willing to practice as a kickoff returner in practice, but Mitchell declined, citing the fracture of his femur on a kickoff return in college. Nonetheless, he still practiced on the kickoff coverage team, and on the punt coverage team as a gunner. Mitchell suffered a hip pointer during the morning session on July 31, but returned for the afternoon session without limitation. A hamstring injury limited him at the end of training camp. Before the start of the 2001 season, head coach Andy Reid said, \\"Mentally, [Mitchell is] right there. He's picked everything up, he's a smart kid. He's wide-eyed, ready to learn. He's done a nice job when he's been in there.\\" Mitchell began the season as the team's fourth wide receiver behind Thrash, Pinkston, and Na Brown. Mitchell's difficulty in learning the complex playbook, as well as the lingering hamstring injury, limited him in the Eagles' first six games of the season. In his first career NFL game, a week one matchup against the St. Louis Rams on September 9, Mitchell played in a few snaps but was not thrown to. Mitchell was listed as \\"questionable\\" due to his hamstring injury before the start of the week two game against the Seattle Seahawks on September 23, and was not activated. Against the Dallas Cowboys in week three on September 30, Mitchell returned to the field and caught his first pass, which went for no gain. In weeks four and six, against the Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants, respectively, Mitchell recorded no catches. In week seven against the Oakland Raiders, he made a catch for 15 yards. Due to Brown's ineffective play, Mitchell replaced him as the Eagles' slot receiver in week eight against the Cardinals and had four receptions for 62 yards. In a week nine game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 11, Mitchell caught three passes for 38 yards and had one rushing attempt for 12 yards. He caught two passes for 15 yards and had one rush for a loss of 16 yards in week ten against the Cowboys. Mitchell was listed as \\"probable\\" on the team's injury report due to a shoulder injury before a week eleven game against the Washington Redskins, but did not record any catches in the game. He made three receptions for 60 yards in a week twelve win over the Kansas City Chiefs on November 29, and Reid said, \\"Every week we're giving Freddie a little bit more responsibility and he's coming along very well right now.\\" In a week thirteen game against the San Diego Chargers, Mitchell caught one pass for five yards and attempted a pass off of a reverse that was knocked down. Against Washington in week 14, Mitchell caught his first career touchdown pass, a four-yard reception in the second quarter. He had two catches for 27 yards in the game. Mitchell caught two passes in each of the next two games for a total of 61 yards. Mitchell made his first two career starts in week seventeen and in a wild card playoff game win against the Buccaneers. He did not record any receptions in either game. Against the Chicago Bears in a divisional playoff game win on January 19, Mitchell caught two passes for 14 yards. In the NFC Championship Game against the Rams on January 27, Mitchell caught one pass for two yards. A pass intended for him on a fourth-down play was intercepted by Rams defensive back Aeneas Williams to clinch the win for St. Louis. Mitchell finished the season with 21 receptions for 283 yards and one touchdown. =2002 season= After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to a one-year contract in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen weeks of the season, Mitchell caught a total of six passes for 53 yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17 yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35 yards. Mitchell only caught twelve passes for 105 yards over the entire season. It was after this dismal performance, despite having the benefit of Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb passing to him, that Mitchell began to be labeled as a \\"bust.\\" =2003 season= Mitchell (second from left) backstage at a country music concert in May 2003 with country singer Neal McCoy (far left) and Eagles teammate Jon Runyan (far right) Mitchell competed with rookie Billy McMullen for the third wide receiver position in 2003 after Freeman left the Eagles following the 2002 season. He eventually beat out McMullen for the slot receiver job. Eagles staff, players, and media called Mitchell one of the most improved players in training camp. Donovan McNabb commented that Mitchell's \\"offseason workouts as well as his mindset has been a whole lot different.\\" In the first four weeks of the season, Mitchell caught six passes for 55 yards. Mitchell had one catch for 29 yards against the Redskins on October 5, and he recovered a Redskins onside kick to clinch the win for the Eagles. He had one reception for 27 yards in a game against the Cowboys in week six. Mitchell started in week seven in place of Pinkston against the Giants but recorded no catches. Against the New York Jets in week eight, he had two catches for 29 yards. In week nine against the Atlanta Falcons, Mitchell caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from McNabb and finished with two catches for 43 yards. He made seven receptions in the next two games for 83 yards. Against the New Orleans Saints in week twelve, Mitchell started and made two receptions for 24 yards. In weeks thirteen and fourteen, he had a combined six catches for 98 yards. On December 15, in a week fifteen game against the Miami Dolphins, Mitchell threw his first touchdown pass, a 25-yard pass to Brian Westbrook, and caught two passes for 30 yards in the 34‚Äì27 win. Against the San Francisco 49ers in week sixteen on December 21, Mitchell made two catches for 23 yards and caught an eight- yard touchdown pass in the second quarter of a week seventeen game against the Redskins on December 27. He had four catches for 47 yards in the game. Mitchell's most significant play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard pass for a first down. The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nine yards in the game. In the NFC Championship Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38 yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498 yards and two touchdowns in 2003. =2004 season= New York Giants on September 12, 2004 With the Eagles' acquisition of wide receiver Terrell Owens and the departure of Thrash, Mitchell kept his role as the slot receiver in 2004. Peter King said Mitchell had \\"a great training camp\\" and that he \\"might be having the best camp of any player I've seen this summer.\\" He made seven receptions in the first four weeks of the season for a total of 118 yards receiving, including three catches for 71 yards against the Detroit Lions in week three. He started against the Panthers on October 17 in week six but did not record any catches. In the following three weeks, Mitchell only had two receptions for 31 yards, with both catches coming against the Cleveland Browns in week seven. His most notable catch of the season was a 60-yard reception during the Eagles' November 15, 2004, Monday Night Football game against the Cowboys. This catch is remembered primarily for the manner in which McNabb extended the play by eluding the Cowboys' pass rush for 14.1 seconds before eventually throwing to Mitchell. Over the subsequent four weeks, Mitchell had one reception in each game for a combined 54 yards. He began to openly voice his frustration over the limited role he continued to play in the Eagles' offense due to Owens' prominence. At one point during the season, after he made a catch, Mitchell would point to his wrist as if to say \\"it's about time.\\" In a week fifteen game against the Cowboys, Owens suffered an ankle injury and was expected to miss the remainder of the season. Mitchell, who suffered a quad contusion during the game, did not make a catch against Dallas, but was named the starter in Owens' place opposite Pinkston. Against the Rams in week sixteen, Mitchell caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from McNabb in the first quarter and finished the game with two receptions for 28 yards. In the final game of the regular season against the Cincinnati Bengals, Mitchell had six receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown. He finished the season with only 22 catches. In a divisional playoff game against the Vikings on January 16, 2005, Mitchell caught a two-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter and celebrated by feigning to pull his pants up, a reference to the touchdown celebration by Vikings' wide receiver Randy Moss, who pretended to pull his pants down to moon Green Bay fans the week before and was heavily criticized for doing so. Mitchell recovered an L. J. Smith fumble in the endzone for a touchdown in the second quarter, and finished the game with a team-high five receptions for 65 yards. In a press conference after the game, Mitchell said, \\"I just want to thank my hands for being so great.\\" He had two receptions for 20 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game on January 23. In the game, Mitchell sported a well-publicized frohawk. Super Bowl controversy The Eagles finished the 2004 season with a 13‚Äì3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC champion New England Patriots. During the week leading up to the game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. Asked to identify the members of the Patriots' secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. Finally, he said he \\"had something\\" for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a \\"jerk.\\" The normally tight-lipped Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, \\"[a]ll he does is talk. He's terrible, and you can print that. I was happy when he was in the game.\\" Mitchell caught only one pass for 11 yards in the 24‚Äì21 loss. After the Super Bowl, Mitchell continued to criticize the Patriots, as well as Belichick, saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of \\"little girls.\\" Later career Mitchell held out from the Eagles' mini-camp in late April 2005, with Andy Reid stating, \\"I did not want him here.\\" Mitchell was released from the team on May 6. He finished his career with the Eagles with 90 receptions for 1,263 yards and five touchdowns. Mitchell worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs on June 6, 2005, following his release from the Eagles. He signed with the Chiefs on June 17 after Az-Zahir Hakim decided against signing with the team. Mitchell did not receive a signing bonus. He began practicing with the team on the last day of mini-camps, June 18, and received extra practice with the coaches the following week. He suffered a knee injury during practice on July 30 and was scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery the following week, but declined to go through with it. He was released on September 2 due to concerns about his knee. Mitchell elected to have knee surgery on September 6 following his release. Mitchell worked out for several teams after his release from the Chiefs, but did not sign a contract with any of them. He worked out for the Green Bay Packers on October 25, 2005, the Dallas Cowboys on August 6, 2006, the Cleveland Browns on October 11, 2006, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League on February 11, 2007, the Tennessee Titans on July 26, 2007, and the Baltimore Ravens on May 29, 2008. The Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League expressed interest in signing Mitchell in January 2006, but president Ron Jaworski, a former Eagles quarterback, had difficulties contacting him. Personal Mitchell (right) in 2003 Mitchell's first cousin is former running back Rod Smart, who played on the Eagles with Mitchell in 2001. Mitchell enjoys country music. Mitchell had several nicknames during his tenure in Philadelphia. These included \\"Fast Freddie,\\" the \\"Sultan of Slot,\\" \\"First Down Freddie,\\" \\"FredEx\\" (claiming he \\"always delivers\\"), the \\"People's Champ,\\" and \\"Hollywood.\\" While with the Eagles, Mitchell was a resident of Moorestown, New Jersey. Mitchell appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno while on UCLA's campus, deliberately answering questions incorrectly. He appeared on A Dating Story, a reality television show, in May 2002. In the episode, Mitchell took Tiffany Schmid, a model in the Philadelphia area, to Great Adventure Amusement Park for their date. Mitchell, as well as several other NFL players, received threatening hate mail in 2003, apparently due to his appearance on the reality show with Schmid as a mixed-race couple at the time. In January 2011, Mitchell appeared on Bravo's The Millionaire Matchmaker, a dating show in which Patti Stanger sets millionaires up to find love. Mitchell's fianc√©e left him after Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005 after they had been together for two years. In 2008, Mitchell returned to Lakeland and bought a local barbecue restaurant called \\"Brothers' Bar-B-Que.\\" In February 2009, Mitchell was under investigation when a package containing of marijuana was delivered to his business. Mitchell was briefly detained, but was not charged. The restaurant was closed briefly in June for violations, but reopened shortly thereafter. On September 3, 2009, the restaurant was closed and Mitchell was named in a suit for failure to make payments on the business. Mitchell officially lost the restaurant in September 2009 after a court ruling. In December 2009, Mitchell was pulled over for speeding in suburban Philadelphia. Due to an outstanding warrant for failure to pay child support, he was arrested on charges of being a fugitive from justice, and was later released on $250,000 bail. Mitchell during one of his Ready For Life charitable appearances Mitchell turned himself in to authorities on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell filed a lawsuit against a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he had headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, 2013, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6, 2013. On May 4, 2012, Mitchell participated in a charity golfing event to benefit the Palm Beach State College Foundation. He rang the ceremonial Liberty Bell in Philadelphia before the start of a National Basketball Association game between the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors on December 22, 2018.

Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels ‚Äì The Falcon Cuts In, 1937, and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938 ‚Äì and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen's short story \\"Gay Falcon\\" (aka \\"A Man Called Falcon\\"), which was originally published in 1940 in Town & Country magazine. The story opens with the words \\"Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them\\". Arlen's Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter ‚Äì a man who makes his living \\"keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.\\" Film appearances  Arlen's Falcon was quickly brought to the screen by RKO. The 1941 movie The Gay Falcon redefined the character as a suave English gentleman detective with a weakness for beautiful women. The film was intended to establish a replacement character for Leslie Charteris' Simon Templar, aka The Saint, who had appeared in a popular RKO film series. To that end, George Sanders, star of The Saint series, was cast in the Falcon role. Though Gay Falcon was the character's name in Arlen's original story, the character was renamed Gay Laurence for the film. (The surname was spelled \\"Lawrence\\" in subsequent films.) Thus \\"The Falcon\\" became an alias, or nickname (√† la \\"The Saint\\"). In later outings, in various media, the character had a variety of \\"real names,\\" while still being known as The Falcon. Neither in films nor on radio was the nickname ever explained. Sanders appeared in the first three Falcon films, which followed the \\"Saint\\" pattern so closely that author Charteris sued RKO for plagiarism. (Charteris pokes fun at The Falcon in his 1943 novel The Saint Steps In, with a character making a metafictional reference to the Falcon being \\"a bargain-basement imitation\\" of The Saint.)Charteris, Leslie. The Saint Steps In (1943) (1980 Charter Books edition, p. 153) The Falcon is almost always accompanied in his travels by a wisecracking sidekick, portrayed variously by Allen Jenkins (in the first three Sanders films), Cliff Edwards, Don Barclay, Edward Brophy, and Vince Barnett. When Sanders tired of B leads, he bowed out of the series in The Falcon's Brother (1942). In the film, Gay Lawrence's brother, Tom Lawrence, became the new Falcon, and was portrayed by Sanders' actual brother, Tom Conway. After The Falcon's Brother, Conway starred in nine more Falcon films through 1946. As with other series of B mystery films, the plot of a Falcon movie generally revolved around a particular locale that the detective was visiting. An oft-used gimmick in the Falcon series was to tack \\"teaser\\" epilogues onto the ends of films. In a teaser, a previously unseen character would approach the Falcon, usually in comic fashion, and signal the title and locale of his next movie. A teaser rarely had anything to do with the plot of the upcoming film, since that film had not yet been produced. The Falcon was revived for three more films, all made in 1948, but these featured the earlier \\"Michael Waring\\" character as created by Drexel Drake. However, he was referred to as \\"Watling\\" and the credits still claimed he was based on a character created by Michael Arlen. Actor-magician John Calvert played \\"The New Falcon\\" in three low-budget features produced by Film Classics. The character went on to appear (as Michael Waring) in radio and television ‚Äì Charles McGraw portrayed the Falcon in the 39-episode syndicated television series Adventures of the Falcon (1954‚Äì55).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047704/http://ctva.biz/US/Adventure/Falcon.htmhttp://www.thrillingdetective.com/falcon.html Film series *Starring George Sanders as Gay Lawrence **The Gay Falcon (1941) **A Date with the Falcon (1942) **The Falcon Takes Over (1942) (based on Raymond Chandler's Farewell, My Lovely) *Starring George Sanders and Tom Conway as the Lawrence brothers; Gay is murdered and Tom Lawrence, his brother, becomes The Falcon **The Falcon's Brother (1942) *Starring Tom Conway as Tom Lawrence **The Falcon Strikes Back (1943) **The Falcon in Danger (1943) **The Falcon and the Co-eds (1943) **The Falcon Out West (1944) **The Falcon in Mexico (1944) **The Falcon in Hollywood (1944) **The Falcon in San Francisco (1945) **The Falcon's Alibi (1946) **The Falcon's Adventure (1946) *Starring John Calvert as Michael Waring **Devil's Cargo (1948) **Appointment with Murder (1948) **Search for Danger (1949) NotesExternal links *The Falcon *On the Trail of Drexel Drake's Falcon: An On-going Investigation by Frank Derato Fictional detectives Film series ","title":"The Falcon (film character)"},{"id":"1339148","text":"Mar Athanasius College of Engineering (MACE) is a government aided engineering college located in Kothamangalam, Kerala state, India.

It was a near normal Atlantic hurricane season, although it was the least active since 1946. The season officially started on June 15; however, a pre-season unnamed storm formed on Groundhog Day, becoming the only storm on record in the month of February. The other six tropical cyclones were named using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, the first of which formed on August 18\\\\. The final storm of the season dissipated on October 28, two and a half weeks before the season officially ended on November 15.

The first hurricane, named Able, struck South Carolina with winds of , causing heavy damage near the coast and widespread power outages. It moved up most of the East Coast of the United States, leaving 3 deaths and widespread damage. As a developing tropical cyclone, Hurricane Charlie caused damaging flooding and landslides in southwest Puerto Rico. The final and strongest of the season, Hurricane Fox, struck Cuba with winds of ; it killed 600 people and left heavy damage, particularly to the sugar crop, reaching $10 million (1952 USD, $ USD).

It moved quickly north- northwestward and acquired gale-force winds as it brushed the northern coast of Cuba. Early on February 3, the storm struck Cape Sable, Florida and quickly crossed the state. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68 mph (110 km/h) during its passage. The winds damaged windows and power lines, catching residents and tourists off-guard. The cyclone also dropped 2‚Äì4 inches (50‚Äì100 mm) of precipitation along its path, causing crop damage in Miami-Dade County. After leaving Florida, the storm briefly transitioned into a tropical storm on February 3, the only tropical or subtropical storm on record in the month. The storm continued rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). On February 4 it evolved into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February 5 dissipated after crossing into Maine. The storm caused scattered power outages and gusty winds across New England. Hurricane Able Over six months after the previous storm dissipated, a tropical depression developed just off the west coast of Africa on August 18\\\\. It moved generally west- to west-northwestward for much of its duration, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 24 east of the Lesser Antilles. The next day, Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of Tropical Storm Able. Passing north of the islands, the storm attained hurricane status on August 27\\\\. On August 30, Able turned to the north- northwest due to an approaching cold front, and the next day made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane with peak winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). The town was heavily damaged, and was briefly isolated after winds downed power and telephone lines. Across South Carolina, the hurricane caused two indirect deaths, as well as moderate damage totaling $2.2 million (1952 USD, $ USD). As Able turned north and northeastward over land, the winds quickly weakened to tropical storm force, although it retained gale force winds through North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland; this was due to remaining over the flat terrain east of the Appalachian Mountains, as well as retaining a plume of tropical moisture from its south. It left light damage in North Carolina, some of it due to a tornado. In Maryland, heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which washed out the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore. In Ellicott City, Maryland, the rains flooded several houses, forcing families to evacuate. Two tornadoes were also reported in the region, and damage in the Washington, D.C. area reached $500,000 (1952 USD, $ USD). Further northeast, the storm continued to produce heavy rainfall, causing flooding, as well as one indirect death in Pennsylvania. After moving through New England, Able dissipated on September 2 near Portland, Maine. Tropical Storm Three A cold front was located north of the Bahamas on August 26, with a broad area of cyclonic turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00 UTC on August 27\\\\. Based on the structure, it is estimated that the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). There was very dry air on the west side of the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115 mi (185 km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00 UTC on August 28\\\\. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35 mph (55 km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August 28 over eastern Kentucky. Hurricane Baker The third tropical cyclone of the season developed on August 31 a short distance east of the northern Lesser Antilles. Its presence was reported by a ship the next day that encountered rough seas and gale force winds. As a result, the Weather Bureau sent the Hurricane Hunters to investigate the system, which reported a strengthening hurricane moving northwestward. Given the name Baker, the hurricane passed north of the Lesser Antilles, reaching peak winds of late on September 3\\\\. For several days, the Hurricane Hunters reported similar winds, along with gusts up to . With a large anticyclone located over the Ohio Valley, Baker turned to the northeast on September 5, passing about halfway between Bermuda and North Carolina. The hurricane slowly weakened as it moved through the north Atlantic Ocean, just missing Newfoundland while maintaining winds of . Wind gusts on Avalon Peninsula reached , and heavy fishing damage was reported in Lower Island Cove. After affecting the island, Baker transitioned into an extratropical storm, which lasted another day before dissipating south of Greenland. Tropical Storm Five A dissipating cold front stalled across the northeastern Atlantic Ocean on September 7, northeast of the Azores. That day, a closed circulation developed and quickly became independent of the front. Based on a uniform thermal structure, as well as ship reports in the region of gale-force winds near the center, it is estimated that the system became a tropical storm early on September 8\\\\. Forming at a latitude of 42.0¬∞N, this system is notable for being the northernmost forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic hurricane database, dating back to 1851. The system moved west-southwestward, atypical for cyclones in that region during September. On September 9, the storm turned to the southeast, reaching estimated peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), based on ship observations. Moving slowly through the northern Azores, the storm produced winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) along Terceira Island. It slowly weakened, and by late on September 10 the system degraded into a tropical depression. By the next day, the system was interacting with an approaching cold front, indicating that the depression had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Around 20:00 UTC, the storm moved ashore the southwestern tip of Portugal with gale-force winds. The storm turned to the northwest through the Iberian Peninsula, dissipating on September 14 over southwestern France. Hurricane Charlie On September 22, a tropical wave moved into the eastern Caribbean Sea, spawning a tropical depression near Hispaniola early on September 24\\\\. As it tracked west-northwestward, the low dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at in Christiansted, United States Virgin Islands, as well as in Garzas, Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, the rains caused landslides that affected seven towns, notably Ponce, the island's second-largest city. There, at least 14 buildings were destroyed. The floods left more than 1,000 people homeless, 300 of whom took refuge in a Red Cross shelter. Overall, the flooding on the island killed four people and left moderate damage of around $1 million (1952 USD, $ USD). After affecting Puerto Rico, the low continued to organize, and subsequently struck the Dominican Republic on September 23\\\\. The circulation became disrupted while crossing Hispaniola, although it reorganized near the Turks and Caicos Islands and became Tropical Storm Charlie before reaching those islands. On September 25, Charlie attained hurricane status,, and due to its continued northwest motion, the Weather Bureau advised small craft to remain at port in the southeastern United States coast. However, the hurricane turned to the north and northeast on September 26, during which the Hurricane Hunters recorded peak winds of . It briefly threatened Bermuda, prompting the United States Air Force to evacuate its fleet of airplanes from Kindley Air Force Base. Charlie ultimately northwest of Bermuda, and later began weakening. On September 29 it turned eastward, and later that day transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants lasted two more days before dissipating southeast of Newfoundland. Tropical Storm Dog On September 18, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa, which spawned a tropical cyclone east of the Lesser Antilles on September 24\\\\. The system quickly intensified and was given the name Dog. The storm moved northwestward for its entire duration. On September 26, Hurricane Hunters observed winds of , with gusts to 100 mph (160 km/h), although they were unable to locate a closed center of circulation. Operationally, Dog was upgraded to hurricane status, but a reanalysis in 2015 downgraded the storm to a peak intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h), making it a strong tropical storm. Dog began weakening on September 27, and over the next few days the circulation lost its definition. On September 29, Dog weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated the next day. The Weather Bureau advised ships to avoid the storm, but overall Dog did not affect land. Tropical Storm Eight On September 24, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa. It is estimated that a closed circulation developed on the next day, suggesting the formation of a tropical depression. On September 26, Santiago island within Cape Verde recorded winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) as the system was passing to the southwest. A minimum pressure of and ship reports of 35 mph (55 km/h) winds indicate that the system reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), or a minimal tropical storm. It turned to the north on September 27 and likely weakened, although observations were sparse. By September 30, the system lost its circulation and degenerated into an open trough. Hurricane Easy On October 6, a tropical depression formed about east of Antigua, near where Tropical Storm Dog developed a week prior. The depression proceeded northward, and was detected by the Hurricane Hunters on October 7 as a strengthening tropical storm. On that basis, the storm was named Easy. On October 8, the Hurricane Hunters observed a 26 mi (46 km) eye and wind gusts to 115 mph (185 km/h). On that basis, Easy was upgraded to a hurricane with peak winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). By that time, the hurricane had turned sharply to the east, and later began to move toward the south. As quickly as it strengthened, Easy began to weaken, and an aircraft reported winds of only on October 9\\\\. The storm headed southwest, ultimately dissipating on October 11 about southwest of where it formed. Easy never affected land. Hurricane Fox The strongest tropical cyclone of the season formed on October 20 in the Caribbean Sea off the northwest coast of Colombia, believed to have been from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It moved northwestward, intensifying into a tropical storm on October 21 and a hurricane the following day. Fox subsequently turned to the north, intensifying to a major hurricane as it passed west of the Cayman Islands. Late on October 24, the cyclone struck the small island of Cayo Guano del Estes in the Archipelago de los Canarreos, south of Cienfuegos, Cuba. It struck the island with peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), and the island reported a minimum pressure of 934 mbar (27.59 inHg). Shortly thereafter, Fox crossed the mainland coast of Cuba west of Cienfuegos, and it weakened while crossing the island. Hurricane Fox crossed Cuba in a rural area dominated by sugar plantations, with heavy damage reported to 36 mills. In one town, the hurricane destroyed about 600 homes and damaged over 1,000 more. Across the island, the strongest winds downed large trees and washed a large freighter ashore. Heavy rainfall affected all but the extreme eastern and western end of the island, with a peak of near Havana. The rains flooded low-lying areas and caused rivers to exceed their banks. Throughout Cuba, Hurricane Fox killed 600 people, and left behind heavy damage totaling $10 million (1952 USD, $ USD). Fox was among the strongest hurricanes to strike the country. After crossing Cuba, Fox emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of , crossing central Andros and turning eastward though the Bahamas. On New Providence, the hurricane dropped of rainfall, Strong winds caused severe crop damage, leaving 30% of the tomato crop destroyed. After briefly restrengthening to a major hurricane, Fox began a steady weakening trend. It turned abruptly to the north-northwest, followed by another turn to the northeast. On October 28, Fox was absorbed by a cold front west-southwest of Bermuda. Tropical Storm Eleven A cold front stalled north of the Virgin Islands on November 23, spawning an extratropical storm the next day. The system strengthened while moving northward, attaining gale force winds on November 25\\\\. It was a large system, and a ship in the vicinity reported a pressure of . The observation, within a warm environment and in concurrence with gale force winds, suggested that the system became a tropical storm on November 26, although the system likely was a subtropical cyclone due to the structure. Turning to the west- northwest along a dissipating cold front, the storm reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on November 27\\\\. Another front in the region steered the storm to the south and east in a counterclockwise circle. Weakening slightly, the system briefly transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 30 before dissipating later that day within the front.

Throughout his life he kept extensive secret diaries, journals and statistics of his sex life. He lived most of his adult life in Chicago, where he tattooed sailor-trainees from the US Navy's Great Lakes Naval Training Station (as well as gang members and street people) out of a tattoo parlor on South State Street. He later moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where he spent the late 1960s as the official tattoo artist of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. Life and career Steward was born in Woodsfield, Ohio and began attending Ohio State University in Columbus in 1927. He taught English at OSU in from 1932 until 1934 as a university fellow.Student Directories, Ohio State University Archives His first year-long post was as an instructor of English in 1934 at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In 1936 he was summarily dismissed from his second teaching position, at the State College of Washington at Pullman, as the result of his sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute in his well-reviewed comic novel Angels on the Bough. He subsequently moved to Chicago, where he taught at Loyola University until 1946. After leaving Loyola to help re-write the World Book Encyclopedia, he subsequently taught at DePaul University. Born into a Methodist household, Steward converted to Catholicism during his university years, but had long since abandoned the Catholic Church by the time he accepted his teaching position at Loyola. From the mid-1930s until 1949 he was deeply alcoholic, but he managed to overcome his addiction to alcohol with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. Steward gained an introduction to Gertrude Stein in 1932 through his academic advisor Clarence Andrews, and so began a long correspondence with Stein which resulted in a warm friendship. He paid visits to her rented country home in France during the summers of 1937 and 1939. During the 1937 trip, he also met with many other literary figures, including Thornton Wilder, Lord Alfred Douglas (the lover of Oscar Wilde), Thomas Mann, and Andr√© Gide. He detailed these encounters, some of them sexual, in his brief memoir, Chapters from an Autobiography. He also described his friendship with Stein and Alice B. Toklas in his Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. Steward met famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in late 1949 and subsequently became an unofficial collaborator with Kinsey's Institute for Sex Research. During his years of work with the Institute, Steward collected and donated sexually themed materials to the Kinsey archive, gave Kinsey access to his lifelong sexual records, introduced him to large numbers of sexually active men in the Chicago area, and provided him with large numbers of early sex Polaroid photographs which he took during the frequent all-male sex parties he held in his Chicago apartment. He also allowed Kinsey to take detailed photographs of that sexually-themed apartment. He ultimately donated large numbers of drawings, paintings and decorative objects that he himself had created to the Institute. In spring of 1950, at Kinsey's invitation, he was filmed engaging in BDSM sex with Mike Miksche, a New York-based erotic artist also known as Steve Masters. After Gertrude Stein, Kinsey was Steward's most important mentor; he later described Kinsey not only \\"as approachable as a park bench\\" but also as a god-like bringer of enlightenment to humankind, thus giving him the nickname, \\"Doctor Prometheus.\\" While making the transition from professor to tattoo artist during the 1950s, Steward befriended a number of gay artists and writers including Paul Cadmus, George Platt Lynes, Julien Green, Fritz Peters, and Glenway Wescott. At Kinsey's specific request he also kept highly detailed journals and diaries of his daily sexual activities, and chronicled them in a secret card catalogue he referred to as his \\"Stud File.\\" Starting in 1957, he began contributing short stories based on his many sexual encounters to the Zurich-based homophile magazine Der Kreis (\\"The Circle\\"), to which he also contributed essays, reviews, and homophile journalism. During his final years in Chicago, Steward befriended Chuck Renslow, coowner of Kris Studio, and Renslow's partner Dom Orejudos, the homoerotic illustrator also known as \\"Stephen\\" and \\"Etienne.\\" Renslow and Orejudos would later go on to open the Gold Coast, Chicago's first leather bar, and to found International Mr. Leather, a yearly gathering of leathermen from around the world. In the 1960s Steward began writing and publishing his erotica under the name of Phil Andros, initially doing so with the Danish magazine Eos/Amigo. Some of his early works described his fascination with rough trade and sadomasochistic sex; others focused on the power dynamics of interracial sexual encounters between men. In 1966, thanks to changes in American publishing laws, he was able to publish his story collection $TUD with Guild Press in the United States, under the pseudonym Phil Andros. By the late 1960s, Steward started writing a series of pulp pornographic novels featuring the hustler Phil Andros as narrator. As a leading tattoo artist of the 1950s and '60s, Steward was mentored by Milwaukee-based master tattooist Amund Dietzel. Steward in turn mentored Cliff Ingram, aka Cliff Raven, and Don \\"Ed\\" Hardy, later known simply as Ed Hardy, encouraging both to practice the Japanese-style tattooing he himself most admired. After retiring from tattooing in 1970, Steward wrote a social history of American tattooing during the 1950s and '60s, which was ultimately published as Bad Boys and Tough Tattoos. Death In his later years Steward's abilities as a writer were compromised by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a barbiturate addiction. He died at the age of 84 in Berkeley, California. Reception and scholarship In 1972, Jack Fritscher became the first gay writer to unearth and interview Steward; his Steward audiotapes were referenced in Justin Spring's biography of Steward. Starting in 2001, Justin Spring tracked down Steward's archive and began writing the biography Secret Historian: The Life and Times of Samuel Steward, Professor, Tattoo Artist, and Sexual Renegade, which was ultimately published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2010. The book was the recipient of many literary honors, and was a finalist for the National Book Award. In 2018 Jeremy Mulderig edited The lost autobiography of Samuel Steward : recollections of an extraordinary twentieth-century gay life. (Chicago : The University of Chicago Press, 2018.) In 2012, 2014, and 2018, Seth Eisen of Eye Zen Presents created the play \\"Homo File\\" depicting the life and times of Steward, as part of a project to unearth and spread gay history from when homosexuality \\"could not speak its name\\". Honors In 2012 Steward was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. Steward was honored in 2017 along with other notables, named on bronze bootprints, as part of San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley.

It is based on E. C. Segar's comics character of the same name. It was written by Jules Feiffer and stars Robin Williams as Popeye the Sailor Man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. Its story follows Popeye's adventures as he arrives in the town of Sweethaven. The film premiered on December 6, 1980 in Los Angeles, California. It grossed $6.3 million in its opening weekend and $49.8 million worldwide, against a budget of $20 million. It received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Popeye, a strong sailor, arrives at the small coastal town of Sweethaven while searching for his missing father. He rents a room at the Oyl family's boarding house where the Oyls plan to have their daughter Olive become engaged to Captain Bluto, a powerful, perpetually angry bully who runs the town in the name of the mysterious Commodore. However, on the night of the engagement party, Olive sneaks out after discovering that the only attribute she can report for her bullying fianc√© is size. She encounters Popeye, who failed to fit in with the townsfolk at the party. The two eventually come across an abandoned baby in a basket. Popeye and Olive adopt the child, naming him Swee'Pea after the town Sweethaven, and the two return to the Oyls' home. Bluto, whom Olive had stood up, finds out about this encounter, which results in him declaring heavy taxation for the Oyls' property and possessions out of rage. A greedy taxman follows up on Bluto's demand, but Popeye helps the Oyls' financial situation by winning a hefty prize from defeating a boxer named Oxblood Oxheart. The next day, Popeye discovers that Swee'Pea can predict the future by whistling when he hears the correct answer to a question. Wimpy, the constantly hungry local mooch and a petty gambler, also notices this and asks Popeye and Olive to take Swee'Pea out for a walk. However, he actually takes him to the \\"horse races\\" (actually a mechanical carnival horse game) and wins two games. Hearing of this, Olive and her whole family decide to get in on the action and use Swee'Pea to win, but an outraged Popeye finds out and takes Swee'Pea away. Later, after Popeye throws the taxman into the sea (simultaneously earning the respect of the town), Wimpy then kidnaps the child at Bluto's orders. Wimpy informs Popeye about the kidnapping, after being threatened by Olive. Popeye goes to the Commodore's ship, where he finds out that the Commodore, who has been recently tied up by Bluto, is indeed Popeye's father, Poopdeck Pappy, who accepts that Popeye is his son after exposing Popeye's hatred of Spinach. Meanwhile, Bluto kidnaps Olive and sets sail with her and Swee'Pea to find buried treasure promised by Pappy. Popeye, Pappy, Wimpy and the Oyl family board Pappy's ship to chase Bluto to Scab Island, a desolate island in the middle of the ocean. Popeye catches up to Bluto and fights him, but despite his determination, Popeye is overpowered. During the fight, Pappy recovers his treasure and opens the chest to reveal a collection of personal sentimental items from Popeye's infancy, including a few cans of spinach. A gigantic octopus awakens and attacks Olive from underwater (after Pappy saves Swee'Pea from a similar fate). With Popeye in a choke hold, Pappy throws him a can of spinach; Bluto, recognizing Popeye's dislike for spinach, force-feeds him the can before throwing him into the water. The spinach revitalizes Popeye and boosts his strength, helping him to defeat both Bluto and the giant octopus. Popeye celebrates his victory and his new-found appreciation of spinach while Bluto swims off, having literally turned yellow.

According to James Robert Parish, in his book Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, the idea for the Popeye musical had its basis in the bidding war for the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Annie between the two major studios vying for the rights, Columbia and Paramount. When Robert Evans found out that Paramount had lost the bidding for Annie, he held an executive meeting in which he asked about comic strip characters which the studio held the rights to which could also be used in order to create a movie musical, and one attendee said \\"Popeye\\". At that time, even though King Features Syndicate (now a unit of Hearst) retained the television rights to Popeye and related characters, with Hanna-Barbera then producing the series The All-New Popeye Hour under license from King Features, Paramount had long held the theatrical rights to the Popeye character, due to the studio releasing Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios, respectively, from 1932 to 1957. Evans commissioned Jules Feiffer to write a script. In 1977, he said he wanted Dustin Hoffman to play Popeye opposite Lily Tomlin as Olive Oyl, with John Schlesinger directing. Hoffman later dropped out due to creative differences with Feiffer. Gilda Radner, then a hot new star as an original cast member of Saturday Night Live, was also considered for the Olive Oyl role.https://www.vulture.com/amp/2012/03/the-lost-roles-of-gilda-radner.html However, Radner's manager Bernie Brillstein later wrote how he discouraged her from taking the part due his concerns about the quality of the script and worries about her working for months on an isolated set with Evans and Altman (both known for erratic behavior and unorthodox creative methods). In December 1979, Disney joined the film as part of a two-picture co-production deal with Paramount which also included Dragonslayer. Disney acquired the foreign rights through its Buena Vista unit; the deal was motivated by the drawing power that the studio's films had in Europe. Principal photography commenced on January 23, 1980.https://popeyemalta.com/about-us.html The film was shot in Malta. The elaborate Sweethaven set was constructed beyond what was needed for filming, adding to the cost and complexity of the production, along with a recording studio, editing facilities, and other buildings related to the production, including living quarters. Filming wrapped on June 19, 1980, three weeks over schedule due to rough weather. The set still exists, and it is a popular tourist attraction known as Popeye Village. According to Parish, Robin Williams referred to this set as \\"Stalag Altman\\". Parish notes a variety of other production problems. Feiffer's script went through rewrites during the production, and he expressed concern too much screen time was being devoted to minor characters. He also disliked Nilsson's songs, feeling they weren't right for the film. The original inflatable arms designed for the muscle-bound Popeye did not look satisfactory, so new ones were commissioned and made in Italy, leaving Altman to film scenes not showing them until the new ones arrived. Altman also had the cast singing their musical numbers live‚Äîcontrary to standard convention for a movie musical where songs are recorded first in a studio and lip-synched‚Äîcausing sound quality problems. Williams also had to re-record his dialogue after running into trouble with his character's mumbling style, a by-product of talking with a pipe in his mouth, and his affinity for ad-libs also led to clashes with the director. The final battle involving the octopus led to more headaches when the mechanical beast failed to work properly. After the production cost rose beyond $20 million, Paramount ordered Altman to wrap filming and return to California with what he had.  Release  Popeye premiered at the Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on December 6, 1980, two days before what would have been E. C. Segar's 86th birthday.  Box office  The film grossed $6 million on its opening weekend in the U.S., and made $32,000,000 after 32 days. The film earned US$49,823,037 at the United States box office ‚Äî more than double the film's budget ‚Äî and a worldwide total of $60 million. Film Comment later wrote \\"Before the film's release, industry wags were calling it 'Evansgate'\\" but \\"Apparently the film has caught on solidly with young children.\\" Although the film's gross was decent, it was nowhere near the blockbuster that Paramount and Disney had expected, and was thus written off as a disappointment.Prince, Stephen (2000) A New Pot of Gold: Hollywood Under the Electronic Rainbow, 1980‚Äì1989 (p. 222). University of California Press, Berkeley/Los Angeles, California.  Home Media  Popeye has been released to several home media formats including VHS, Betamax, CED, Laserdisc, DVD, and through digital services in SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) video resolution. On Sept. 18, 2020 Paramount Home Entertainment announced the first Blu-ray Disc edition of Popeye will be released on Dec. 1, 2020 in honor of its 40th Anniversary.  Critical response  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 61% based on reviews from 33 critics, with the critical consensus stating [that] \\"Altman's take on the iconic cartoon is messy and wildly uneven, but its robust humor and manic charm are hard to resist.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 64 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing that Duvall was \\"born to play\\" Olive Oyl, and with Popeye Altman had proved \\"it is possible to take the broad strokes of a comic strip and turn them into sophisticated entertainment.\\" Gene Siskel also awarded 3.5 out of 4, writing that the first 30 minutes were \\"tedious and totally without a point of view\\", but once Swee'pea was introduced the film \\"then becomes quite entertaining and, in a few scenes, very special.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 12, 1980). \\"First-rate fairy tale for adults\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 3. Richard Combs of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"In its own idiosyncratic fashion, it works.\\" Other critics were unfavorable, such as Leonard Maltin, who described the picture as a bomb: \\"E.C. Segar's beloved sailorman boards a sinking ship in this astonishingly boring movie. A game cast does its best with an unfunny script, cluttered staging, and some alleged songs. Tune in a couple hours' worth of Max Fleischer cartoons instead; you'll be much better off.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181219171531/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1989-11-16-8903100044-story.html Quote: Even so, Maltin considers the film a bomb, calling it astonishly boring in his annual guide. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a thoroughly charming, immensely appealing mess of a movie, often high-spirited and witty, occasionally pretentious and flat, sometimes robustly funny and frequently unintelligible. It is, in short, a very mixed bag.\\" Variety wrote that all involved \\"fail to bring the characters to life at the sacrifice of a large initial chunk of the film. It's only when they allow the characters to fall back on their cartoon craziness that the picture works at all.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"While there are things to like in this elaborately stylized, exasperating musical slapstick fantasy ... they emerge haphazardly and flit in and out of a precarious setting.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \\"rarely uninteresting but seldom entirely satisfying\\", and thought that the adult tone of the dialogue left it \\"uncertain what the film's target audience is intended to be.\\"Champlin, Charles (December 12, 1980). \\"A Miscalculated Voyage With 'Popeye'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 1, 10.  Soundtrack = Original release  The soundtrack was composed by Harry Nilsson, who took a break from producing his album Flash Harry to write the score for the film. He wrote all the original songs and co-produced the music with producer Bruce Robb at Cherokee Studios. The soundtrack in the film was unusual in that the actors sang some of the songs \\"live\\". For that reason, the studio album did not quite match the tracks heard in the film. Van Dyke Parks is credited as music arranger. In the U.S. trailer for the film, which contained the song \\"I Yam What I Yam\\", the version heard of the song was from the soundtrack album, not the film. \\"I'm Popeye the Sailor Man\\" was composed by Sammy Lerner for the original Max Fleischer cartoon. The song \\"Everything Is Food\\" was not included on the album, while the song \\"Din' We\\" (which was cut from the film) was included. In 2016, a vinyl-only limited-edition version of the album was released with two bonus tracks by Var√®se Sarabande for Record Store Day Black Friday.  2017 deluxe edition  In 2017, Var√®se Sarabande released a deluxe edition that places the songs into the original order of the film, reinstates \\"Everything Is Food\\", and includes a second disc of demo versions of the songs sung by Nilsson and the cast.http://undertheradarmag.com/reviews/harry_nilsson_popeye_deluxe_edition_music_from_the_motion_picture_varese_sahttps://www.varesesarabande.com/products/popeye- deluxe-edition ; Disc 1 ; Disc 2  References  Further reading  *  External links   * 1980 films 1980 romantic comedy films American adventure comedy films American musical comedy films American romantic comedy films American films American romantic musical films English-language films Films based on comic strips Films directed by Robert Altman Films produced by Robert Evans Films shot in Malta Films with screenplays by Jules Feiffer Harry Nilsson Live-action films based on animated series Live-action films based on comics Paramount Pictures films Pirate films Popeye Seafaring films Walt Disney Pictures films 1980 comedy films ","title":"Popeye (film)"},{"id":"1339189","text":"Walter Louis Garland (11 November 1930 ‚Äì 27 December 2004) professionally Hank Garland, was an American guitarist and songwriter. He started as a country musician, played rock and roll as it became popular in the 1950s, and released a jazz album in 1960. His career was cut short when a car accident in 1961 left him unable to perform. 2007 saw the release of the Hank Garland biopic Crazy. Biography Born in Cowpens, South Carolina, Garland began playing guitar at the age of six. He appeared on local radio shows at 12 and was discovered at 14 at a South Carolina record store. He moved to Nashville at age 16, staying in Ma Upchurch's boarding house, where he roomed with Bob Moore and Dale Potter. At age 18, he recorded his million-selling hit \\"Sugarfoot Rag\\". He appeared on the Jubilee program with Grady Martin's band and on The Eddy Arnold Show. Garland is perhaps best known for his Nashville studio work with Elvis Presley from 1958 to 1961 which produced such rock hits as: \\"I Need Your Love Tonight\\", \\"A Big Hunk o' Love\\", \\" I'm Coming Home\\", \\"I Got Stung\\", \\"A Fool Such As I\\", \\"Stuck on You\\", \\"Little Sister\\", \\"(Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame\\", and \\"I Feel So Bad\\". He worked with many country music rock and roll musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s, such as Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Mel Tillis, Marty Robbins, The Everly Brothers, Boots Randolph, Roy Orbison, Conway Twitty, and Moon Mullican. Garland's guitar drove such classic recordings as Little Jimmy Dickens' \\"I Got a Hole in My Pocket\\"; Benny Joy's \\"Bundle of Love\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Move\\"; Jimmy Lloyd's (recorded under pseudonym of (Jimmie Logsdon) \\"You're Gone Baby\\" and \\"I've Got a Rocket in My Pocket\\"; Lefty Frizzell's \\"You're Humbuggin' Me\\"; Simon Crum's \\"Stand Up, Sit Down, Shut Your Mouth\\"; and Johnnie Strickland's (1935-1994) \\"She's Mine\\"; plus, seasonal staples \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" with Bobby Helms, and Brenda Lee's seasonal \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\". Don Gibson's \\"Sweet Sweet Girl\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me Your Troubles\\"; Patsy Cline's \\"Let the Teardrops Fall\\"; Ronnie Hawkins' \\"Jambalaya\\"; and Faron Young's \\"Alone with You\\" spotlighted Garland's guitar work. He played with George Shearing and Charlie Parker in New York and went on to record Jazz Winds from a New Direction with Gary Burton on vibraphone, Joe Benjamin on double bass, and Joe Morello on drums. At the request of Gibson Guitar company president Ted McCarty, Garland and guitarist Billy Byrd influenced the design of the Byrdland guitar, which derived from the Gibson L-5, having a slimmer body and shorter scale for ease of playing. In September 1961, a car crash left Garland in a coma. He regained consciousness and recovered with the help of his wife, Evelyn and two daughters, but not sufficiently to return to the studios. After Evelyn died at the age of 38 in a car crash in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on December 2, 1965, Garland's parents took care of him until their deaths. Garland suffered from constant ill health in his later years and died in Orange Park, Florida on December 27, 2004 of complications from a staph infection. He was 74 years old. He is interred in Jacksonville Memory Gardens in Orange Park. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Hank Garland among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It was developed by Saber Interactive and published by Ubi Soft. It received polarized review, with scores of 90s down to 20s, and some likened the title to a poorer version of Serious Sam. In Will Rock, the player takes on the persona of the title character Willford Rockwell, an archeology student, who is faced with the aftermath of a fanatical group called the Olympian Restoration Army (ORA), who have managed to bring back to life a host of mythological creatures from Ancient Greece, including Zeus, king of the Gods, who has abducted Will's girlfriend Emma. Will is recruited by Prometheus, the Greek Titan of fire and craft, to destroy Zeus and his minions‚Äîand rescue his girlfriend. There are ten levels in the single player and coop versions. Many reviewers noted the massive numbers of enemies, prompting IGN to remark that it \\"elevates the experience to a kind of inspired lunacy.\\" Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Release Notes With the aid and powers of the titan Prometheus, Will Rock rampages through Lost Olympus, seeking the safe return of his love, Emma, and revenge for the murder of his mentor, Dr. Headstrong.

An action is of the form \\"IF is true, THEN do \\". An action axiom tests a condition (antecedent) and, if the condition has been met, then (consequent) it suggests (mandates) an action: from knowledge to action. A decision model may also be a network of connected decisions, information and knowledge that represents a decision-making approach that can be used repeatedly (such as one developed using the Decision Model and Notation standard). Excepting very simple situations, successful action axioms are used in an iterative manner. For example, for decision analysis, the sole action axiom occurs in the Evaluation stage of a four-step cycle: Formulate, Evaluate, Interpret/Appraise, Refine. Decision models are used to model a decision being made once as well as to model a repeatable decision-making approach that will be used over and over again. Formulation Formulation is the first and often most challenging stage in using formal decision methods (and in decision analysis in particular). The objective of the formulation stage is to develop a formal model of the given decision. This may be represented as a network of decision-making elements, as a decision tree or in other ways depending on the specific situation. The formulation may be conceptual or may include all the necessary decision logic (business rules) required to define the decision-making. Evaluation Evaluation is the second and most algorithmic stage in using formal decision methods. For a decision being made once, the objective of the evaluation stage is to produce a formal recommendation (and its associated sensitivities) from a formal model of the decision situation. For a repeatable decision evaluation occurs each time the decision is made by applying the decision model that has been developed. Appraisal Appraisal is the third and most insightful stage in using formal decision methods. The objective of the appraisal stage is for the decision maker to develop insight into the decision and determine a clear course of action. Much of the insight developed in this stage results from exploring the implications of the formal decision model developed during the formulation stage (i.e., from mining the model). Central to these implications is the formal recommendation for action calculated during the evaluation stage. Other implications include various forms of Sensitivity of the recommendation to various components of the decision model. Insight may also result from discussion of the key aspects of the reasoning that led to the formal decision model (i.e., by justifying the model). Possible actions following the appraisal stage include implementing the recommended course of action, revising the formal model and reevaluating it, or abandoning the analysis and doing something else. Justifying a decision model entails exploring and explaining the reasoning that led to the formulation of particular aspects of the decision model. Mining a decision model entails extracting information (e.g., sensitivity, value of prediction, and value of revelation) from a given decision model. Refinement Refinement is the fourth and most critical stage in using formal decision methods. The refinement stage responds to the insights obtained during the Appraisal stage. Effective refinement activities include opportunities to test possible decision model changes to see their implications and suggest better ways to modify the decision model.

Zipcar provides automobile reservations to its members, billable by the minute, hour or day; members may have to pay a monthly or annual membership fee in addition to car reservations charges. Zipcar was founded in 2000 by Antje Danielson and Robin Chase. On March 14, 2013, Avis Budget Group acquired Zipcar for approximately million. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed and passed the reins to a new company president, Mark Norman. In early 2014, Kaye Ceille took over as Zipcar's North American President. In the summer of 2016, Kaye Ceille became a managing director of Avis Budget Group International. In September 2016, Zipcar announced that it had 1 million members across 500 cities in 9 countries, and offers nearly 10,000 vehicles. Members can reserve vehicles with Zipcar's mobile app, online, or in some places by phone at any time, either immediately or up to a year in advance. Zipcar members have automated access to the cars using an access card which unlocks the door; the keys are already located inside. Alternatively, members can use Zipcar's Android or iPhone app to locate a Zipcar by honking its horn as well as to unlock the doors. Zipcar charges a one-time application fee, an annual fee, and a reservation charge. Fuel, parking, insurance, and maintenance are included in the price. In the third quarter of 2007, Zipcar merged with Seattle-based rival Flexcar to create a nationwide car rental company. The company's IPO was in April 2011. Zipcar common stock traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol \\"ZIP\\" until it was acquired by Avis in 2013. History Zipvan vehicle in London Zipcar was co-founded by Antje Danielson and Robin Chase based on existing German and Swiss companies in January 2000. In June 2000, the first Zipcars hit the road around Boston, Massachusetts. In January 2001, Antje was fired after Robin Chase petitioned Zipcar's board for the ability to make hiring and firing decisions without consulting them. In September 2001, the Washington, D.C. office opened, with the branch in New York City following in February 2002. In February 2003, after difficulties in securing additional rounds of funding, the Zipcar board replaced Robin Chase as CEO with Scott Griffith. In July 2005, Zipcar secured $10 million in funding led by Benchmark Capital. In August 2005, San Francisco office opened. In May 2006, the Toronto office opened. In May 2006, General Electric's Commercial Finance Fleet Services () gave Zipcar $20 million in lease line financing. In September 2006, Toronto market was named fastest growing new market in company history. In November 2006, London office opened. In April 2007, Vancouver office opened. In October 2007, Zipcar and Flexcar executives announced a merger of the two companies, with the Zipcar brand and headquarters replacing that of Flexcar. On 23 January 2008, the merged Zipcar/Flexcar canceled service for the Southern California cities of Los Angeles and San Diego without providing advance notice to customers in those areas, although Southern California college operations were left intact. On July 11, 2008, Zipcar announced it doubled membership in past year, including the Flexcar members it acquired, and now had 225,000 members. On August 28, 2008, Rice University announced its introduction into the program in their goal of achieving the lowest possible carbon footprint while providing additional transportation options for employees that carpool. In June 2009, the company announced an iPhone application at the Apple World Wide Developer Conference; the application is capable of honking the horn and unlocking some Zipcars. Following impressive third-quarter results, previous CEO Scott Griffith announced that 2012 would mark Zipcar's \\"first full year of profitability on a US GAAP basis\\". Scott Griffith stepped down on March 15, 2013 following Avis Budget Group's acquisition of Zipcar. Mark Norman remained as President until February 2014, when Avis Budget Group announced that Kaye Ceille was appointed president of Zipcar, and \\"Mark Norman would step down in order to pursue another career opportunity.\\" In July 2016, Kay Ceille stepped down as president of Zipcar to become the managing director of Avis Budget Group International, Australia. On January 5, 2017, Zipcar announced that after a 6-month search they appointed Tracey Zhen as its new president. Zhen came over from TripAdvisor where she had been a vice president and general manager. Zipcar saw a significant swing in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a falloff in demand in March 2020 and a surge in May. Having taken cars off the road, the company had trouble keeping up with demand, causing a backlog at the customer service center.Zipcar confronts surge in interest after lockdowns eased Some customers arrived at the time of their reservation to find no car in the parking spot. Some customers reported being stranded without transportation and unable to reach customer service to complain or cancel their membership.Zipcar's customer service outrages its users, draws backlash President Tracey Zhen apologized in June, saying the company was adding cars and customer service employees. By that month, she reported membership applications in New York City 70% above June 2019. An anonymous employee told CNN that the problems were exacerbated by laying off more than 20% of its employees, and changing call centers.

A member can reserve and use a Zipcar in any Zipcar city. Fees Zipcar parking in Pittsburgh Zipcar was sued in 2009 and again in 2011 by customers alleging that they charged excessive or hidden fees. The suit cited several hidden charges, including a charge to talk to a customer service representative even when customers call to report a problem that cannot be handled through the website or automated phone system, additional fees on top of the cost of a parking ticket even if the ticket was overturned in court, late fees starting at $50, a fee to retrieve items left in cars, and an inactivity fee. According to the complaint, many customers may not even be aware of the charges because Zipcar does not send monthly statements. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2010, after U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton found that every penalty except an inactive-user charge is legal. In August 2016, Zipcar agreed to settle a case involving allegations of charging New York consumers illegal damage fees for rental vehicles. According to New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, New York State law mandates if rental car companies mean to pursue charges for damages to their vehicles, they must give consumers the opportunity to dispute the complaint. Schneiderman's office alleges Zipcar failed to follow this requirement. The company sometimes purportedly charged consumers damage fees before notifying them of the charges. As a settlement, Zipcar will refund any damage charges assessed against consumers who disputed their responsibility for the damage. Additionally, the company will pay the Attorney General's Office $35,000 for fees and costs. In addition, Zipcar is barred from charging customers for damage unless those customers agree they are liable or the company obtains a legal determination‚Äîfor example, from a court‚Äîthat the driver is responsible. As of September 25, 2018, the business is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau and averages a one-star review from the BBB from numerous complaints alleging deceptive business practices.https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/boston/profile/auto-renting-and- leasing/zipcar-inc-0021-90415 University, organization and business partnerships Zipcar launched its Zipcar for Business program in early 2004 to provide companies with discounts on Monday-Friday driving. Since the launch of the program, Zipcar has signed 10,000 small, medium, and large sized businesses, as companies are increasingly adopting Zipcar's on demand car rental model as a cost-saving alternative for employee travel. Zipcar has partnered with over 600 colleges and universities across North America. Zipcar fleet The Chevrolet Volt Plug-in hybrid is available to Zipcar members in Chicago. Zipcar offers more than 50 makes and models of vehicles. Each vehicle has a home location: a reserved parking space located on a street, driveway, or neighborhood parking lot in the member's area, to which it must be returned at the end of the reservation. The locations of all Zipcars and models available at those locations are available at the Zipcar website. Zipcar currently (2019) has a fleet of 12,000+ vehicles. The makes and models of Zipcar vehicles available vary by location (for example, on college campuses, most Zipcar vehicles are economy, hybrid, and full-size cars), though members are able to choose the exact make and model of vehicle they wish from the list of available vehicles online or in the Zipcar smartphone application. Most Zipcar vehicles will feature decals with the Zipcar logo. Each vehicle has a \\"name\\" that help the renter to identify their specific vehicle. Zipcar offers vehicles in different categories, such as economy cars, electric vehicles (EV's), hybrid vehicles, full-size cars, luxury vehicles (such as those from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and other luxury manufacturers), SUV's, pickup trucks, and cargo vans. A Zipcar vehicle will not unlock for the renter until their exact reservation time. Renters unlock their vehicle (both at the beginning of the reservation and throughout the rental) by either holding their Zipcar membership Radio Frequency Identification RFID card or smartphone against the upper corner of the vehicle's windshield. The vehicle's keys are always tied to the steering column of the vehicle, and stay inside the vehicle at all times. A Zipcar \\"Copilot\\" guide is located in the driver's side sun visor, and includes a complimentary refueling card (gasoline card), insurance information, the vehicle registration card, and information about both the vehicle, as well as rental policies and procedures. Embedded technologies Zipcars have RFID readers located on the windshield that communicates with the card to lock and unlock the doors of the vehicle. Each vehicle records hours of usage and mileage, which is uploaded to a central computer via a wireless data link. The location of the vehicles is not tracked during a reservation for privacy reasons but is trackable, and all cars are equipped with a \\"kill\\" function that allows the company to prevent the car from starting in the event of theft. Zipcar also offers the embedded Information Technologies it has installed in its fleet as a fleet optimization service through its FastFleet service. During a rental, a Zipcar member can interface with their rented vehicle using the Zipcar smartphone app, which includes the ability to locate the vehicle in a parking lot (including GPS location and the ability to sound the vehicle's horn and flash the lights) and unlock or lock the vehicle. Clean fuel vehicles Among its fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles, and through an agreement between Honda and Zipcar, the program offers clean fuel and low-emission vehicles that include the Insight hybrid, Civic Hybrid, and Honda Fit EV all-electric car. Vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius are also available. Zipcar Flex In the United Kingdom, some vehicles are branded \\"Zipcar Flex\\" which means that they can be left anywhere within a designated zone, rather than in a specific parking space. The remaining vehicles are branded \\"Zipcar Roundtrip\\".Fleet News https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/07/10/zipcar-flex- one-way-drive-and-drop-car-club-service-launched-in-london Expansion On October 31, 2007, Zipcar and Flexcar announced their intentions to merge. The merged company retained the name \\"Zipcar\\" and was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Zipcar's chief executive, former Seattle-based Boeing engineer Scott Griffith, became Chairman and CO, while Flexcar CEO Mark Norman became President and Chief Operating Officer. The merger combined Zipcar's fleet of 3,500 vehicles in 35 markets with Flexcar's 1,500 cars in 15 markets. In December 2009, Zipcar announced their participation in a round of financing with Avancar, the largest on-demand car rental company in Spain, based in Barcelona. Under the terms of the agreement, Zipcar acquired a minority interest in Avancar, a Zipcar executive joined Avancar's board and Zipcar was given a year option to increase the company's ownership stake. Later on in April 2010, Zipcar announced that it had acquired London-based car-sharing club Streetcar. In December 2010, Zipcar extended their option for another year through the end of 2011, and provided a monetary loan to Avancar, which is convertible into equity if Zipcar chooses to exercise the option. On October 17, 2012, Zipcar announced the completion of its Avancar integration. On January 22, 2019 Zipcar (Avancar) members received notification that the service would no longer be available as of midnight, February 28, 2019. On Facebook and Instagram, the company cited a decision made by Avis to discontinue the service in the Spanish city. Since 2014, Zipcar has started services in cities in North America, Europe, and Asia. Insurance Zipcar drop off/pick up area in downtown Washington, D.C. Zipcar provides liability coverage of $100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, and $25,000 property damage per accident for members over 21 years of age who joined after March 1, 2015. Members at fault are responsible for the first $1,000 of costs related to the repair, recovery, and loss of use of any Zipcar vehicle. However, members can purchase no-liability insurance for an additional $79 a year. Members involved in accidents where fault is not determined (such as in a hit and run) must pay the first $1000 of these costs. For members under 21, Zipcar provides insurance coverage at state-mandated levels. Zipcar has received some scrutiny for their low coverage limits. Insurance coverage may vary depending on the region of use. For example, Canadian members in Toronto, Ontario, are provided with $1,000,000 in liability coverage. Vancouver, BC members are provided with $2,000,000 in liability coverage. Both regions in Canada also include comprehensive and collision coverage in addition to liability insurance. Previously, Zipcars traveling into Canada from the U.S. required members to obtain a special insurance card from Zipcar. As of February 2018, however, it appears that this is no longer the policy. Canadian Zipcars traveling into the U.S. do not need the extra insurance card. Similar to members of Zipcar U.S., members of Zipcar London, UK, require a special 'vehicle on-hire' certificate when traveling abroad, which can be obtained from Zipcar.

It is the principal town and seat of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang. Name Tashkurgan means \\"Stone Fortress\\" or \\"Stone Tower\\" in the Turkic languages. The historical Chinese name for the town was a literal translation (, Sh√≠touch√©ng). The official spelling is Taxkorgan, while Tashkorgan and Tashkurghan appear occasionally in literature. The town's name is written in the Uyghur Arabic alphabet as and in the Uyghur Latin alphabet Tashqurghan baziri. Historically, the town was also called Sarikol () or Sariqol () or the traditional spelling (ÿ≥ÿßÿ±ŸäŸÇ ŸÇŸàŸÑ). History The fortress in 1909. Ruins of Tashkurgan Fort in 2011. Stone Tower\\" of Ptolemy, where caravans from the West met to trade with those from China. Tashkurgan has a long history as a stop on the Silk Road. Major caravan routes converged here leading to Kashgar in the north, Yecheng to the east, Badakhshan and Wakhan to the west, and Chitral and Hunza to the southwest (modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan). About 2000 years ago, during the Han dynasty, Tashkurgan was the main centre of the Kingdom of Puli () mentioned in the Book of Han and the Book of the Later Han. Later it became known as Varshadeh.Hill (2009), Note 20.2, pp. 394-401. Mentions in the Weil√ºe of the Kingdom of Manli () probably also refer to Tashkurgan.Hill, John E. 2004. The Peoples of the West from the Weil√ºe by Yu Huan : A Third Century Chinese Account Composed between 239 and 265 CE. Draft annotated English translation... Link Some scholars believe that a \\"Stone Tower\\" mentioned by Ptolemy and by other early accounts of travel on the Silk Road refers to this site. This tower is said to have marked the midway point between Europe and China. Other scholars, however, disagree with this identification, though it remains one of the four most probable sites for the Stone Tower. Many centuries later Tashkurgan became the capital of the Sarikol kingdom (), a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains, and later of Qiepantuo () under the Persian Empire. At the northeast corner of the town is a huge fortress known as the Princess Castle dating from the Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368 CE) and the subject of many colourful local legends. A ruined fire temple is near the fortress. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang passed through Tashkurgan around 649 CE, on his way to Khotan from Badakhshan, as did Song Yun around 500 CE. When Aurel Stein passed through the town in the early twentieth century he was pleased to find that Tashkurgan matched the descriptions left by those travellers: discussing Qiepantuo, Xuanzang recorded (in Samuel Beal's translation), \\"This country is about 200 li in circuit; the capital rests on a great rocky crag of the mountain, and is backed by the river ≈öit√¢. It is about 20 li in circuit.\\" Xuanzang's discussion of Qiepantuo in book twelve of Great Tang Records on the Western Regions recounts a tale which might explain the name of the Princess Castle: A Han Chinese princess on her way to marry a Persian king is placed on a high rock for safety during local unrest. She becomes pregnant from a mysterious stranger, ultimately giving birth to a powerful king and founding the royal line ruling at the time of Xuanzang's visit. Stein records a version of this, current at the time of his visit, in which the princess is the daughter of the Persian king Naushƒ´rvƒÅn. Aurel Stein argued that, judging from the topography and remains found around Tashkurgan, the fort and associated settlements had clearly been central to the broader Sarikol area, controlling routes from the Oxus to the oases of southern Turkestan. Xuanzang describes a substantial Buddhist site with tall towers, leading Stein to speculate as to whether the pilgrimage site dedicated to ShƒÅh Auliya, several hundred yards to the northeast of the town site, and in use at the time of his visit, might have seen continuous but changing local use as a holy site down the centuries. In 1959, Tashkurgan Commune () was established. In 1984, Tashkurgan Commune became Tashkurgan Town. In 2010-11, the residential communities of Bulakegale () and Xudong () were added to the town and Kuonabazha () and Yingshahai'er () were removed. In 2016-7, the residential community Xingfu () was added to the town. In 2017-8, the residential community Hongqi () was added to the town. In 2018-9, the residential community Shajilin () was added to the town. Museum Caravanserai between Dafdar and Tashkurgan In Tashkurgan there is a museum that houses a few local artifacts, a photographic display and, in the basement, two mummies ‚Äì one of a young woman about 18 and another of a baby about three months old who was not hers. They are labelled as dating from the Bronze Age to the Warring States period (475‚àí221 BCE). The mummies were discovered in the nearby Xiabandi Valley on the old caravan route to Yarkand. The valley has now been flooded for a hydro-electric project. Geography Tashkurgan is the seat of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County. It is situated at an altitude of on the borders of both Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and close to the borders of Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan. Tashkurgan is a market town for sheep, wool and woollen goods, particularly carpets, and is surrounded by orchards. The majority population in the town are ethnic Mountain Tajiks. The majority of people in the region speak Sarikoli. There is also a village of Wakhi speakers. Mandarin Chinese and Uyghur are also spoken. The Tashkurgan River begins just north of the Khunjerab Pass and flows north along the Karakoram Highway to Tashkurgan. Just north of Tashkurgan it turns east and flows through a gorge to the Tarim Basin where it joins the Yarkand River. Climate Tashkurgan has a cold desert climate (K√∂ppen BWk), influenced by the high elevation, with long, very cold winters, and warm summers. Monthly daily average temperatures range from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . An average of only of precipitation falls per year. Administrative divisions , the town included six residential communities (Mandarin Chinese pinyin-derived names): * Kashigale (), Bulakegale (), Xudong (), Xingfu (), Hongqi (), Shajilin () As of 2009, there were three residential communities: * Kashigale (), Kuonabazha (), Yingshahai'er ()  Transportation  As the area is remote from populated regions, a hot and high airport is under development and scheduled to complete by 2022, with 3800 meter runway. It will be China's closest airport to Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. Karakoram Highway Overview of the Karakoram Highway Today Tashkurgan is on the Karakoram Highway which follows the old Silk Road route from China to Pakistan. Accommodation is available and it is a recommended overnight stop for road travellers from China to Pakistan, in order to have the best chance of crossing the snow-prone Khunjerab Pass in daylight. Special registration with the police must be made before entering Tashkurgan, and Chinese citizens must receive written permission from their local police department before entering the region. Travelling from Xinjiang, it is about south of Kashgar and is the last town before the border with Pakistan. It is over the Khunjerab Pass from Sust, which is the Pakistani border town. Passenger road service between Tashkurgan and the Pakistani towns of Sust and Gilgit has existed for many years, and road service between Kashgar and Gilgit (via Tashkurgan and Sust) started in summer 2006. However, the border crossing between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Pass (the highest border of the world) is open only between May 1 and October 15. During winter, the roads are blocked by snow.

Founded in 1981 by Atari, Inc. and Mattel expatriates, its best-selling titles were Atlantis, Cosmic Ark, and Demon Attack. Imagic also released games for Intellivision, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit family, TI-99/4A, IBM PCjr, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and Magnavox Odyssey¬≤. Their Odyssey¬≤ ports of Demon Attack and Atlantis were the only third-party releases for that system in America. The company never recovered from the North American video game crash of 1983 and was liquidated in 1986. History Imagic was the second third-party publisher for the Atari 2600, formed after Activision. Founders included Bill Grubb, Bob Smith, Mark Bradlee, Rob Fulop, and Denis Koble from Atari, Inc., Jim Goldberger, Dave Durran and Brian Dougherty from Mattel. Grubb previously servied as the vp of sales and marketing for Atari for 18 months. to form Imagic. Before that, he was with the marketing department at Black and Decker for 11 years. It was Grubb's goal to take Imagic public and to eventually overtake Activision as the number one third-party video game publisher. Atari sued Imagic over Demon Attack because of its resemblance to Phoenix, to which Atari had the exclusive home-version rights. The case was settled out of court. Despite initial success and sales greater than projections, the company's fortunes reversed after the stock market dumped videogame stocks in late 1982, scuttling Imagic's initial plan to become a publicly traded company.http://www.livevideo.com/video/151AF95D9F4D4AD0B23A7123E2B65C0C/making- of-atlantis-video-game-part-3-imagic.aspx Fan club During its height, Imagic ran a fan club for their games, the Numb Thumb Club, which published an annual newsletter.

Joe Wiesenfelder, Portable Audio, Spin, Vol 11 No. 7, Oct. 1995, page 100 Technology When the buffering circuitry is in operation, the compact disc is read at a fixed read speed or CAV and the content is buffered (with optional ADPCM compression) and fed to RAM within the player. The audio content is read from RAM, optionally decompressed, and then sent to the digital-to-analog converter. When the disc reading is interrupted, the player momentarily reads the data stored in RAM while the tracking circuitry finds the passage prior to the interruption on the CD. Another method has the disc rotating at variable or CLV speed (the normal rotation method for a CD player), but at a slightly higher speed than with the buffer feature switched off. The buffer method is the same as before. History The technology surfaced around 1995 as a physically smaller alternative to the bulky rubber shock absorbers utilized in portable players at the time. It reduced the size of the hitherto bulky players designed for use in moving cars, in particular. Small rubber shock absorbers are still used, but are less effective than the larger pre-1995 ones. When first introduced, 3 seconds was the maximum buffering time. In 2006, the time generally ranged from 10 seconds to \\"skip-free\\", where the player will rarely skip. Due to the nature of the ATRAC compression scheme, and to ensure uninterrupted playback in the presence of fragmentation, all MD decks and portables buffered at least 10 seconds when the format was introduced in 1992. , MD units have much bigger buffers. Flash-based MP3 players with no moving parts do not require electronic skip protection. Pros *Interruption-free performance. Cons *On older players (1992‚Äì1997), battery life is shortened due to the fixed (CAV) read speed of the disc and power required by the memory.

It is the 14th book in the Redwall series. Plot summary His birth was a long- awaited legend full of mystery and promise, among the outlaw Juska tribes along the western shore. Denoted by a unique mark on his right paw, the Taggerung is a fearsome fighter (In the story, the word 'Taggerung' literally means a warrior of unbeatable strength, courage, and savagery), a warrior the likes of which has not been seen for many seasons.(Sawney Rath's father was the most recent). When a seer from one tribe predicted his birth at Redwall Abbey, Sawney Rath, leader of the Juskarath, sets out to capture the Taggerung. In Mossflower Woods, Rillflag an otter from Redwall is completing a birth ritual with his newborn son, Deyna, when Sawney Rath and his tribe of vermin ambush him. Vallug Bowbeast, a deadly ferret archer of the Juska Tribe murders Rillflag and captures the legendary infant. Sawney renames the young otter Zann Juskarath Taggerung or \\"Tagg\\" for short, determined to raise him as his own son, and to bring the Taggerung under his control. US cover of Taggerung depicting Tagg with an Icelandic tail-cap. As Tagg begins to grow older, he finds himself at odds with his fellow tribe members. He refuses to become violent and soon finds himself as the only member of the tribe who has never killed for fun, or at all. When Sawney orders him to skin a runaway fox named Felch, Tagg refuses, enraging Sawney. Finding the roles reversed, Tagg flees and finds himself pursued by the ferret leader of the Juskarath. Unfortunately for Rath, his chase is short-lived, as he is soon murdered by the ambitious stoat Antigra with a slingstone. Antigra hates Sawney Rath because she wishes her son, Gruven to be named as the Taggerung, and because of that, Sawney Rath had murdered her husband. Sawney's death enables her bumbling son Gruven Zann to take control of the newly renamed Juskazann tribe. The vixen seer Grissoul tells Gruven he must hunt down the former Taggerung and bring back his head. Only then will some other ambitious Juska warriors accept him as their leader. To aid him in his quest, Gruven recruits a small band of vermin including Vallug Bowbeast, the deadly assassin, and Eefera, a high-ranking weasel, to continue the hunt for the Taggerung. Unfortunately for Gruven, his band of vermin would rather kill him than follow his orders, if only the opportunity presented itself. They are too accustomed to following Sawney's orders to listen to the newly appointed chief. Tagg runs away to find a pear tree, which he eats from and is reprimanded by two voles. They decide he won't hurt them and invite him back to their home to eat stew and meet their nice friends. He enjoys this very much and would love to stay, but sadly, he knows that the Juskarath are chasing him. He bids them a bittersweet goodbye and sets off in a boat they give him. In his travels, Tagg befriends a similarly mysterious (and, unlike Tagg, prone to telling lies) harvest mouse named Nimbalo the Slayer, by saving him from a deadly snake from the mountains. Finding themselves in the company of a pygmy shrew colony, they rest until they are attacked by Gruven and his slowly-diminishing band of vermin. Gruven and his band start a landslide, killing and burying many pygmy shrews. As Tagg chases the attackers of his newfound companions, the vermin scatter, leaving only one unfortunate member behind. Under the harsh gaze of Tagg, and the threat of being thrown to the pygmy shrews who lost loved ones in the landslide, the long-time member of Rath's old tribe reveals all, including the name of Tagg's true home: Redwall Abbey. At the same time, Eefera the weasel and Vallug Bowbeast, the most rebellious and intelligent vermin under Gruven's command, decide to desert Gruven, deciding that him and the other two remaining hordebeasts would die in the mountain. They, being better trackers than Gruven, decide to follow the Taggerung and kill him, to bring his head back to the tribe and claim leadership over the Juskas. But they are both silently trying to find an opportunity to kill the other; Vallug is the more dangerous as a killer, but Eefera is a better tracker and more cunning. When Tagg arrives at Redwall, he's mistaken for one of the members of the band of Juska supposed to be hunting him, knocked out and locked up in the cellars. He's then released on impulse by the assistant cook Broggle when the Juska, Eefara and Vallug, who have now captured Gruven and the other vermin, are threatening to kill Nimbalo, but then their plans go wrong. Tagg goes out to fight, and slays Vallug and Eefara, at the same time getting shot with an arrow by Vallug Bowbeast while Nimbalo goes after another rat. Then, Filorn, Tagg's mother, recognises her son. Cregga Rose Eyes, the ancient blind badgermum, after being shot in the chest with an arrow, appoints Deyna's sister, Mhera, as the new Abbess of Redwall, succeeding the now deceased Abbess Songbreeze, and then dies shortly after. Rukky Garge, a local otterfixer, manages to remove the distinguishing mark of the Taggerung from Deyna's paw, remove his tattoos, and remove the arrow. Deyna's quest is not quite over, however, as the fox Ruggan Bor, now commanding the remnants of the Juskazann tribe as well as followers of his own, the Juskabor, shortly arrives to attack the stronghold of Redwall Abbey. Due to Gruven's bragging on his return, they now believe the Taggerung is dead and seek to confirm this rumour. As chance may have it, however, the badger ruler of Salamandastron, Russano the Wise, arrives in time to fend off Bor's attack, sending him and his vermin crew crawling on their bellies off into the sunset. Russano then takes a medal from around his neck and drapes it over Cregga Rose Eyes's grave, as she was his adoptive mother many seasons before this terrible battle happened. This had been his reason for travelling to Redwall in the first place.

It is the 11th book published and 13th chronologically in the Redwall series. Marlfoxes are an unusual breed of anthropomorphic foxes, which serve as the main antagonists in the book. Plot summary The wandering Noonvale companions travel to Redwall, where they wish to mount a show. On the way, however, they learn that the Marlfoxes will attempt to seize Redwall, and hasten onward to warn them, while Guosim from another part of Mossflower do the same. The Marlfoxes consist of High Queen Silth and her brood. They are different from other foxes in their fur, which gives them the ability to blend into almost any surrounding, invisible to all but the keenest eye. This ability has given rise to the false rumour that the Marlfoxes are magic, which they are not. However, Marlfoxes are highly agile and skilled with axes. Castle Marl, home of the Marlfoxes, is situated in the middle of an enormous inland sea, on the island that was once home to Badger Lord Urthwyte the Mighty. The Marlfoxes command a vast army of water rats, and they travel around the country seeking rare and priceless artifacts. US cover of Marlfox The Marlfoxes, backed by an army of water rats, mount a successful invasion of Redwall and steal the tapestry of the long dead hero, Martin the Warrior. The Marlfox Ziral is slain, however, and the remaining Marlfoxes swear revenge on the citizens of Redwall. Mokkan, one of the Marlfoxes, escapes with the tapestry, leaving his siblings behind. Three young Redwallers, Songbreeze Swifteye, Dannflor Reguba, and a Guosim shrew named Dippler set out after Mokkan, trying to retrieve the tapestry. They meet Burble, a water vole, and have many adventures and meet many friends who help them on their journey, such as the gigantic hedgehog Sollertree, who lost his daughter Nettlebud to the Marlfoxes and water rats, and the Mighty Megraw, a large osprey who used to live by the Marlfox island but was driven away in an ambush by magpies. Meanwhile, the remaining Marlfoxes lay siege to Redwall. After a series of battles, Songbreeze's father Janglur Swifteye, Dannflor's father Rusvul Reguba, Cregga Rose Eyes, and many others fight off the remaining army, killing the remaining Marlfoxes and restoring peace to Redwall. The surviving rats are divided into eight groups, with each group sent in a different direction. Song, Dann, Dippler and Burble meet some new friends and set out into the great lake to the island. Mokkan finds that Silth has been killed by one of his sisters, Lantur. He promptly kills her by pushing her into the lake full of pike, proclaiming himself King. However, the companions arrive and overthrow the water rat army. Mokkan escapes in a boat, but an escaped slave, whom we find out is Nettlebud, throws a chain at him and knocks him into the lake, where he is eaten by pike. The surviving water rats are left on the island to become peaceful creatures and farm the land, and the companions return home to Redwall, where Songbreeze Swifteye is named Abbess and Dannflor Reguba is named Abbey Champion by Cregga Rose Eyes, Redwall's blind badgermum. Dippler is named Log-a-log, and Burble is named Chief of the Watervoles. At the end of the novel is a note, stating that the entire tale was made into a drama, edited by one Florian Dugglewoof Wilffachop.

The attack was carried out by British and Australian troops and was subsidiary to the Battle of the Somme. General Headquarters (GHQ) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had ordered the First and Second armies to prepare attacks to support the Fourth Army on the Somme, to the south, to exploit any weakening of the German defences opposite. The attack took place from Lille, between the Fauquissart‚ÄìTrivelet road and Cordonnerie Farm, an area overlooked from Aubers Ridge to the south. The ground was low-lying and much of the defensive fortification by both sides consisted of building breastworks, rather than trenches. The operation was conducted by XI Corps of the First Army with the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and the 5th Australian Division, Australian Imperial Force (AIF) against the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, supported by the two flanking divisions of the German 6th Army. Preparations for the attack were rushed, the troops involved lacked experience in trench warfare and the power of the German defence was significantly underestimated, the attackers being . The advance took place in daylight, on a narrow front, against defences overlooked by Aubers Ridge, with German artillery on either side free to fire into the flanks of the attack. Another attack by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division early on 20 July was cancelled, after it was realised that German counter-attacks had already forced a retirement by the Australian troops to the original front line. On 19 July, General Erich von Falkenhayn, head of (OHL, the German army supreme headquarters) judged Fromelles to be the offensive he expected against the 6th Army. The attack gained no ground but inflicted some casualties; next day the failure was evident and a captured operation order from XI Corps revealed the limited nature of the operation. In 2012, a study of German records showed that no German division opposite XI Corps moved until four to nine weeks later; Falkenhayn sent divisions from the Souchez‚ÄìVimy area, south instead, which had been misinterpreted in earlier accounts. The attack was the of the AIF on the Western Front and the Australian War Memorial described it as \\"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history\\". Of suffered by the 5th Australian Division; the Germans lost and Background On 5 July, during the Battle of the Somme November 1916) GHQ informed the three other British army commanders that the German defences on the Somme might soon fall. The First and Second army commanders were required to choose places to penetrate the German defences, if the attacks on the Somme continued to make progress. Gaps were to be widened to exploit weakness and disorganisation of the German defence. The Second Army commander, General Herbert Plumer was occupied by preparations for an offensive at Messines Ridge but could spare a division for a joint attack with the First Army at the army boundary. On 8 July, General Charles Monro (First Army) ordered the XI Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Richard Haking , to plan a two-division attack; Haking proposed to capture Aubers Ridge, Aubers and Fromelles but the next day Monro dropped Aubers Ridge from the attack, as he and Plumer thought that no great objective could be achieved with the troops available. On 13 July, after receiving intelligence reports that the Germans had transferred about nine infantry battalions from the Lille area from 9 to 12 July, GHQ informed the two army commanders that a joint attack was to be carried out around 18 July, to exploit the depletion of the German defenders. Haking was ordered to begin a big preliminary bombardment to simulate a large offensive and conduct a local infantry attack on the German front line. On 16 July, discussions about the attack resumed, as the need for diversions to coincide with operations on the Somme had diminished when the Germans had not collapsed after the British success at the Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14 July 1916). Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, did not want the attack unless it could succeed and Monro and Haking opposed a postponement or cancellation. The weather had been dull on 15 July and next day, soon after Monro and Haking made the decision to go ahead, it began to rain. Zero hour for the main bombardment was postponed because of the weather and at Haking delayed the attack for at least ; after having second thoughts, Monro postponed the operation until 19 July. Prelude=Offensive preparations The Second Army provided the 5th Australian Division, the artillery of the 4th Australian Division and heavy guns and trench mortars to XI Corps, for an attack from the Fauquissart‚ÄìTrivelet road to La Boutillerie, with the 31st Division and 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. Lack of artillery, training and experience in the Australian divisional artilleries and some of the heavy batteries, led to the attack front being reduced to between the Fauquissart‚ÄìTrivelet road and Delangre Farm. The ground was waterlogged, flat and visible from Aubers Ridge, behind the German front to the south. The 39th Division and 31st Division moved their boundaries north as the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division concentrated along the Fauquissart‚ÄìTrivelet road to Bond Street. The 20th (Light) Division moved its boundary south to Cordonnerie Farm on the left of the 5th Australian Division, which concentrated from Bond Street to Cordonnerie Farm. The twelve attacking battalions were supported by more artillery than the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, more ammunition was available and there were trench mortars for wire cutting. With support from First Army artillery to the south, guns and guns were ready, which gave a greater concentration of heavy artillery than that of the Fourth Army on the first day of the Somme. After several postponements for rain, visibility was better on 18 July and the artillery bombardment proceeded. The shelling of the German front at La Bass√©e was repeated and the German artillery retaliated. Plan The German salient at Fromelles contained some higher ground facing north-west, known as the Sugarloaf. The small size and height of the salient gave the Germans observation of no man's land on either flank. The 5th Australian Division (Major-General James McCay) was to attack the left flank of the salient by advancing south as the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division attacked on the right flank from the west. Each division was to attack with three brigades in line, with two battalions from each brigade in the attack and the other two in reserve, ready to take over captured ground or to advance further. Haking issued the attack orders on 14 July, when wire cutting began along the XI Corps front. It was intended that the bombardment would inflict mass casualties on the German infantry, reducing them to a \\"state of collapse\\". The British infantry were to assemble as close to the German lines as possible, no man's land being wide, before the British artillery fire was lifted from the front line; the infantry would rush the surviving Germans while they were disorganised and advance to the German second line. Heavy artillery began registration and a slow bombardment on 16 July and two days of bombardment began either side of La Bass√©e canal as a diversion. The main bombardment was to begin at midnight on for seven hours (more rain forced a postponement). Over the final three hours, the artillery was to lift and the infantry show bayonets and dummy figures several times, to simulate an infantry advance, then the artillery was to resume bombardment of the front line to catch the German infantry out of cover. German preparations General Erich von Falkenhayn, the German Chief of the General Staff, had ordered a construction programme on the Western Front in January 1915, to make it capable of being defended indefinitely by a small force against superior numbers. An elaborate, carefully sited and fortified front position was built behind fields of barbed wire, with camouflaged concrete machine-gun nests and a second trench () close behind the front trench (), to shelter the trench garrison during bombardments. Communication trenches were built to evade Allied artillery-fire intended to obstruct the movement of reinforcements from the new rear defences. The front position was to be held at all costs as the main line of resistance but in May 1915, Falkenhayn ordered a reserve position to be built along the Western Front, behind the front position, out of range of enemy field artillery. To contain a breakthrough, the second position was to be occupied opposite a sector broken into and serve as a jumping-off point for counter-attacks. If the front line could not be recovered, the rear position could be connected to the remaining parts of the front line on either side to contain the break-in. The construction programme was a huge undertaking and was completed in the autumn 1915. The fortification programme had several opponents, notably the 6th Army commander Crown Prince Rupprecht, who claimed that a rear position would undermine the determination of soldiers to stand their ground. The front of the 6th Army had been quiet since the Battle of Loos (25 September ‚Äì 14 October 1915) and in July 1916, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division held a stretch of the front with four regiments, from east of Aubers village, north to a point near Bois-Grenier, each regiment having one battalion in the front line, one in support and one in reserve. On one regimental front there were with of concrete protection. After a British gas attack opposite Neuve Chapelle and Fauquissart late on 15 July, German artillery bombarded the British front line and a raid on the Australian lines by of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21, caused nearly taking three prisoners, for a loss of Attack=First Army Patrols during the night reported no movement in the German lines, which appeared to be weakly held. German covering parties stopped Australian raiders on the right flank of the 5th Australian Division front, where the wire appeared to be intact except on the left. It was hazy early on 19 July but the artillery zero hour was fixed for ready for the attack at A special heavy artillery bombardment began on the Sugarloaf at by which time a German counter-bombardment was falling all along the attack front, causing casualties to the Australians and the field gunners of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division at Rue Tilleloy. Several ammunition dumps were exploded and the decoy lifts by the British artillery failed to deceive the Germans. The Australian and British infantry began to move into no man's land at In the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division area, infantry of the 182nd Brigade on the right flank, began to move into no man's land through sally ports but some were under German machine-gun fire and became death traps. Two companies of the right-hand battalion managed to get within of the German parapet, with few casualties, then rushed the breastwork as the artillery lifted, finding the wire cut and the Germans incapable of resistance. Uncut wire held up the advance to the second line and German machine-gun fire from the right flank caused many casualties as the survivors reached the objective. Reinforcements reached the front trench but German flanking fire caused many casualties and German artillery began to bombard the captured area. The left-hand battalion lost more men in no man's land and then found that the wire at the Wick salient was uncut. The few infantry to get through the wire were shot down short of the front trench; reinforcements were also caught in no man's land and pinned down. In the centre, the 183rd Brigade was bombarded before the advance began and Shrapnel shell-fire prevented the infantry from using the sally ports. After climbing the parapet, both battalions were shot down in no man's land, only a few men getting close to the German wire before being killed or wounded. On the left, the attacking battalions of the 184th Brigade had been in the front line under German artillery-fire all morning. On the right, the sally ports were under fire and only a few troops reached the German wire, finding that is was uncut, before falling back. The attack of the left-hand battalion towards the Sugarloaf salient (which was beyond trench-mortar range) was stopped by German fire on the sally-ports; the British tried to exit along \\"Rhondda Sap\\", which was under shrapnel bombardment. Most of the battalion was destroyed but some troops reached the north-east part of the salient and tried to enter the German breastwork, until all became casualties. On the 5th Australian Division front, the troops attacked over the parapet, suffering fewer casualties than the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. The 15th (Victoria) Brigade advanced next to the British 183rd Brigade towards the junction of the German line and Layes Brook, which ran diagonally across no man's land. The right battalion advance was stopped by machine-gun fire from the Sugarloaf after and the left hand battalion ran into uncut wire, both battalions suffering many casualties as the survivors dug in. In the Australian centre the 14th (NSW) Brigade had fewer casualties, reached the German front line and took a number of prisoners. When the Australians pressed on they found only flat fields and ditches full of water. A line was selected for consolidation and ten machine- guns were sent forward. The 8th Australian Brigade battalions attacked through machine-gun fire from the front and flanks. A mine was blown on the outer flank to make a crater lip to screen the attacking infantry but when the Australians reached the German breastwork they kept going, finding the same terrain as the 14th Australian Brigade. The 32nd Australian Battalion, on the eastern flank, suffered many casualties while attacking a German stronghold in the ruins of Delangre Farm and elements of the 14th Australian Brigade reached a main road south of the German line before withdrawing to the ditch. The 8th and 14th Australian Brigades had gained their objectives, capturing about of the German front line. A line was selected for consolidation and a strong point built at the end of the , a German communication trench. Reinforcements with equipment and tools went forward and work began on a communication trench across no man's land in the midst of a German artillery barrage and movement attracting machine-gun fire. By accurate reports reached Major-General Colin Mackenzie, commander of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, of the success on the right, along with erroneous reports of limited success in the centre and a small lodgement on the Sugarloaf on the left. At Haking ordered Mackenzie to attack the Sugarloaf again to assist the Australians, before it was discovered that the 184th Brigade had been held up short of its objective. The 15th Australian Brigade was asked to co-operate with the British attack and the 58th Australian Battalion was sent forward. A renewed bombardment continued as preparations were made to attack all along the front at when at Haking cancelled the attack and ordered that all troops were to be withdrawn after dark. Reinforcements for the 182nd Brigade received the order in time but the troops in the German line were overwhelmed, only a few wounded and stragglers getting away. Troops pinned down in no man's land withdrew under cover of the bombardment and parties went out to rescue wounded. More discussion between Mackenzie and Haking, led to the corps commander ordering the 184th Brigade to attack the Sugarloaf overnight, after a ten-minute hurricane bombardment; German shelling on the British front line then caused a postponement until the morning. The postponement failed to reach the 58th Australian Battalion, which attacked with some of the 59th Australian Battalion and was stopped in no man's land with many casualties, survivors from three battalions finding their way back after dark. Despite reinforcements, the situation of the 14th Australian Brigade in the German lines became desperate. Artillery-fire and German counter-attacks from the open right flank forced a slow withdrawal in the dark. On the left flank, more troops were sent forward, with ammunition, to the 8th Australian Brigade at dusk and at every soldier who could be found was sent forward. Consolidation in the German lines was slow as the troops lacked experience, many officers had become casualties and there was no dry soil to fill sandbags, mud being a poor substitute. German counter-attacks on the front and flanks, with machine- gun fire from Delangre Farm, De Mouquet Farm and The Tadpole, began at on 20 July, forcing a retirement to the German first line and then a withdrawal to the original front line; many Australians were cut off and captured. News of the retirement by the 8th Australian Brigade reached McCay while at a meeting with Mackenzie, Haking and Monro, to plan the new attack by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. Monro ordered the 14th Australian Brigade to be withdrawn and at the artillery began a box-barrage around the brigade. At the order to retire arrived, although it was not received by some parties. German troops had got well behind the right flank and fired at every sign of movement, forcing the Australians to withdraw along the communication trench dug overnight. By the remnants of the 53rd, 54th and 55th Australian battalions had returned; many wounded were rescued but only four of the machine-guns were recovered. Artillery-fire by both sides diminished and work began on either side of no man's land to repair defences; a short truce was negotiated by the Germans and Australians to recover their wounded. Air operations From 14 July the Illies‚ÄìBeaucamps road, behind the German front line, was kept under air observation by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 16 July 16 Squadron joined 10 Squadron on the attack front along with a kite balloon section, bringing the I Brigade RFC squadrons supporting the attack up to three corps squadrons and two army squadrons. The corps aircraft photographed and reconnoitred the area before the attack and flew artillery- observation and contact patrols during the battle. Army squadrons flew further afield and denied German reconnaissance aircraft view of British troop movements, particularly behind the XI Corps front. On 19 July, aircraft from two squadrons patrolled the area towards Lille and had numerous air engagements, in which two Fokker E.Is and a British DH.2 were shot down. Bombing raids on German army billets, supply dumps and the railways from Lille to Lens, Douai, Cambrai and Valenciennes also took place. German 6th Army Opposite the British right, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 17 lost a switch trench facing Trivelet, a second line was overrun and the garrison was lost. Troops on the left of III Battalion to the south of the Trivelet road bombed to its right and part of I Battalion attacked frontally and from the right, taking On the Australian flank, III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was pushed back in the centre and on its right, forming a defensive flank at the and in front of Delangre Farm. The right flank of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 repulsed the 15th Australian Brigade and was then reinforced by the II Battalion from Rue Delaval, which joined with the left of III Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21. A counter-attack ordered by the divisional commander at , fell into confusion in the dark, under British artillery-fire and an attack on the 8th Australian Brigade, by part of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 was stopped by Australian small-arms fire. Later on, two other companies attacked up the as I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 and half of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 20 attacked from the flank, reaching the old front line at on 20 July. The right flank of the 14th Australian Brigade was counter-attacked by most of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16, which joined the II Battalion and recaptured the front line step-by-step until dawn, when a pause was ordered due to exhaustion and lack of ammunition and grenades. When the attack resumed, the troops met those of Bavarian Reserve Regiment 21 at around German artillery support was less extensive than that available to the attackers but managed to \\"smother the British trenches with fire\\" as the artillery of the 50th Reserve Division and 54th Reserve Division fired from the flanks \\"thus the backbone of the British (sic) attack was broken before it left the trenches at \\". Aftermath=Analysis Neither division was well prepared for the attack; the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division had disembarked in France in late May 1916, after delays in training caused by equipment shortages and being milked for drafts to the 48th (South Midland) Division. The British entered the front line for the first time on 13 June and every man not due to participate in the attack spent from 16 to 19 July removing poison gas cylinders from the front line after the discharge planned for 15 July was suspended due to the wind falling; were removed before the work was stopped because the men were exhausted. The 5th Australian Division had arrived in France only days before the attack and had relieved the 4th Australian Division on the right flank of the Second Army by 12 July. The Australian divisional artillery and some of the heavy artillery had no experience of Western Front conditions and as I Anzac Corps prepared to move south to the Somme front, a considerable shuffling of divisions had taken place, which hampered preparations for the attack. The limited nature of the attack quickly became obvious to the German commanders. A German report on 30 July, recorded that captured officers said that the Australians made a fundamental mistake in trying to hold the German second trench, rather than falling back to the front trench and consolidating. When the 15th Australian Brigade was pinned down in no man's land, the continuity of the attack broke down and lost protection against flanking fire from the right, which enabled German troops to counter-attack, regain the first trench and cut off the Australian troops further forward. A German assessment of 16 December, called the attack \\"operationally and tactically senseless\\" and that prisoner interrogations revealed that the Australian troops were physically imposing but had \\"virtually no military discipline\\" and \\"no interest in soldiering as it was understood in Europe\\". A communiqu√©, released to the press by British GHQ, was not favourably received by the Australians. \\"Yesterday evening, south of Armenti√®res, we carried out some important raids on a front of two miles in which Australian troops took part. About prisoners were captured\\". Australian casualties and doubts about the judgement of higher commanders, damaged relations between the AIF and the British, with doubts about the reliability of British troops spreading in Australian units. In 2008, Jeffrey Grey wrote that McCay also made errors in judgement that contributed to the result, citing McCay's order not to consolidate the initial gains and that poor planning, ineffective artillery support and Australian inexperience of Western Front conditions, contributed to the failure. A number of senior Australian officers were removed after the and the recuperation of the 5th Australian Division took until late summer, when it began trench- raiding. In October, the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, with morale high after the defensive success at Fromelles, was sent to the Somme front and never recovered from the ordeal; Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 spent ten days in the line and suffered . In 2012, Michael Senior wrote that the objective of the attack was contained in the First Army Operational Order 100 (15 July), Haking had ordered that the troops due to attack were to be told that Senior wrote that historians generally judged the attack to have failed in its objective, to prevent German troops being transferred to the Somme. Wilfid Miles, the British official historian, wrote that the IX Reserve Corps and the Guard Reserve Corps had been moved to the Somme. In his 2012 biography of Haking, Senior wrote that he had only consulted the official history volume 1916 II for his earlier book and had changed his mind after studying German records. Peter Pedersen wrote that the Germans knew that Fromelles was a decoy and sent reserves to the Somme; in the Australian official history Charles Bean wrote that the attack showed the Germans that they were free to withdraw troops. In 2007, Paul Cobb wrote that the Germans were not deterred from sending troops to the Somme. Senior wrote that there was evidence that the transfer of troops to the south was delayed by the attack on Fromelles; a German intelligence officer of the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division wrote on 20 July, A Bavarian document discovered in 1923 contained information that Charles Bean wrote in 1930 that the Bavarians might have been sceptical that the British would sacrifice as a decoy. The IX Reserve Corps and Guard Reserve Corps had been moved from the Souchez‚ÄìVimy area, from Fromelles, well outside the sector opposite the British XI Corps. Troops kept in the Loos‚ÄìArmenti√®res sector, opposite XI Corps, for four weeks after 19 July were held back as a precaution. German records showed that eight divisions were in the line between Loos and Armenti√®res on 1 July and that two were sent to the Somme by 2 July, long before the Fromelles attack; the other six divisions stayed opposite XI Corps for five to nine weeks after 19 July. Had divisions moved earlier, the Battle of Pozi√®res might have cost I Anzac Corps far more than the that it suffered. Senior concluded that because of the Attack at Fromelles, German troops had been retained opposite XI Corps as intended. Casualties The battle caused one of the greatest numbers of Australian deaths in action in 24 hours, surpassed only at the Battle of Bullecourt in 1917. The 5th Australian Division suffered in the 8th Australian Brigade, of the 15th Australian Brigade, in the 14th Australian Brigade and from the divisional engineers. Two battalions had so many casualties that they had to be rebuilt. Of from the 60th Australian Battalion, only one officer and ranks survived unwounded and the 32nd Australian Battalion suffered The 31st Australian Battalion had and the 32nd Australian Battalion lost The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division was understrength before the battle and contributed only half as many men as the 5th Australian Division and suffered The 6th Bavarian Reserve Division suffered casualties of Australian and British soldiers killed in the area that was re-taken by the Germans, were buried shortly after the battle. The burial pits were photographed from a British reconnaissance aircraft on 21 July but marked as dugouts or trench-mortar positions. On 22 July, the bodies were taken by narrow gauge trench railway and buried in eight pits. Commemoration=New cemetery Most war graves on the Western Front were discovered by official surveys during the 1920s; British and Empire dead were reburied in Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries. Four hundred unidentified Australian soldiers killed in the Attack at Fromelles were re-buried at the V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial, north-west of Fromelles (the only large exclusively Australian cemetery in France). Mortal remains of those killed in no man's land were recovered after the war and buried at V.C. Corner British Cemetery. In 2002, Lambis Englezos was inspired by Don't Forget Me Cobber (Corfield, 2000), to search for an unmarked mass grave near Fromelles. The site was found by Englezos and other researchers near Fromelles at , (Pheasant Copse/Pheasant Wood) to the Germans, (). The researchers believed that the pits had not been found after the war and gained support for an exploration of the site from the Australian Army and the British All Party Parliamentary War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group. In 2007, a geophysical survey was commissioned by the Australian government. The survey indicated that the pits had been undisturbed since the war and contained the remains of 337 soldiers. From 23 May to 13 June 2008, an exploratory dig found human remains, personal effects, webbing, brass fitments, uniform badges, buttons and British .303 ammunition in five of six pits, which were then refilled. Exhumations took place from May to September 2009, which recovered the mortal remains of approximately 173 being Australian, from whom DNA samples were taken. The original burial site was unsuitable and a new CWGC war cemetery was built about away. On 30 January 2010, the first body was interred at Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery and the remaining bodies were buried in individual ceremonies by the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and the Australian Army. In March 2010, it was reported that soldiers killed at Fromelles had been identified from DNA. On 19 July 2010, the 94th anniversary of the battle, the last soldier (who remained unidentified) was buried. The cemetery was dedicated in a broadcast public ceremony. Memorials and museum There are several memorials in the Fromelles area commemorating the battle. The V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial was built in the early 1920s, the Australian Memorial Park opened in 1998 and the Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery was completed in 2010. There are other small cemeteries in the area with burials from the battle. In Fromelles Town Hall, there is a museum () run by the (ASBF). A new is under construction. The plaque in it pays tribute to the pioneering work of Robin Corfield and Lambis Englezos in gaining wider attention to the battle and the loss of life of so many Australians, as well as British soldiers.

Noted for her supporting work in comedies when a teenager, she has since expanded to leading roles in independent dramas and film franchises, receiving such accolades as an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe. Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019. Born in Sacramento, California, Larson was homeschooled. At age six, she became the youngest student admitted to a training program at the American Conservatory Theater. She soon relocated to Los Angeles and began her acting career in 1998 with a comedy sketch on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She appeared as a regular in the 2001 sitcom Raising Dad and briefly dabbled with a music career, releasing the album Finally Out of P.E. in 2005. Larson subsequently played supporting roles in the comedy films Hoot (2006), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and 21 Jump Street (2012), and appeared as a sardonic teenager in the television series United States of Tara (2009‚Äì2011). Larson's breakthrough came with a leading role in the acclaimed independent drama Short Term 12 (2013), and she continued to take on supporting parts in the romance The Spectacular Now (2013) and the comedy Trainwreck (2015). For playing a kidnapping victim in the drama Room (2015), Larson won the Academy Award for Best Actress. The 2017 adventure film Kong: Skull Island marked her first big-budget release, after which she starred as Carol Danvers in the 2019 Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero films Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame. Larson has co-written and co-directed two short films, and made her feature film directorial debut with the independent comedy-drama Unicorn Store (2017). For producing the virtual reality series The Messy Truth VR Experience (2020), she won a Primetime Emmy Award. A gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors, Larson is vocal about social and political issues.  Early life  The American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where Larson was the youngest student admitted Larson was born Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers on October 1, 1989, in Sacramento, California, to Heather (Edwards) and Sylvain Desaulniers. Her parents were homeopathic chiropractors who ran a practice together, and they have another daughter, Milaine. Her father is French Canadian, and in her childhood, Larson spoke French as her first language. She was mostly homeschooled, which she believed allowed her to explore innovative and abstract experiences. Describing her early life, Larson has said that she was \\"straight-laced and square\\", and that she shared a close bond with her mother but was shy and suffered from social anxiety. During the summer, she would write and direct her own home movies in which she cast her cousins and filmed in her garage. At age six, she expressed interest in becoming an actress, later remarking that the \\"creative arts was just something that was always in me\\". That same year, she auditioned for a training program at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where she became the youngest student admitted. Larson experienced trauma when her parents divorced when she was seven. She had a dysfunctional relationship with her father; she has recalled, \\"As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation. But he didn't do himself any favors. I don't think he ever really wanted to be a parent.\\" Soon after their split, Heather relocated to Los Angeles with her two daughters to fulfill Larson's acting ambition. They had limited financial means and lived in a small apartment near Hollywood studio lots at Burbank. Larson described her experience, \\"We had a crappy one-room apartment where the bed came out of the wall and we each had three articles of clothing.\\" Even so, Larson has recounted fond memories of that period and has credited her mother for doing the best she could for them. As her last name was difficult to pronounce, she adopted the stage name Larson from her Swedish great- grandmother as well as an American Girl doll named Kirsten Larson that she received as a child. Her first job was performing a commercial parody for Barbie, named \\"Malibu Mudslide Barbie\\", in a 1998 episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She subsequently took on guest roles in several television series, including Touched by an Angel and Popular. In 2000, she was cast in the Fox sitcom Schimmel, which was canceled before airing when its star, Robert Schimmel, was diagnosed with cancer.  Career = Comedies and music career (2001‚Äì2008)  Larson's first major role came as Emily, the younger daughter of Bob Saget's character, in the WB sitcom Raising Dad, which aired for one season during the 2001‚Äì02 television schedule. Hal Boedeker of Orlando Sentinel criticized the program and wrote that its cast members were \\"merrily joking through the show\\". She was next hired for the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith, but she and some other cast members were replaced after an unaired pilot. In 2003, she starred alongside Beverley Mitchell in the Disney Channel movie Right on Track, based on the junior drag race star sisters Erica and Courtney Enders, and played minor roles in the 2004 comedies Sleepover and 13 Going on 30. Larson developed an interest in music at age 11 when she learned to play the guitar. A music executive encouraged her to write her own songs, and she began self-recording and uploading tracks to her own website. After failing to get cast as Wendy Darling in the 2003 film Peter Pan, Larson penned and recorded a song named \\"Invisible Girl\\", which received airplay on KIIS-FM. She soon signed a recording deal with Tommy Mottola of Casablanca Records; she and Lindsay Lohan were the only artists signed by the label at that time. In 2005, she released the album Finally Out of P.E., in which she also co-wrote songs with other songwriters, including Blair Daly, Pam Sheyne, Lindy Robbins, and Holly Brook. She named it after a gym teacher she disliked and has said that the songs she wrote were mostly about failed job opportunities. One of her singles, \\"She Said\\", was featured in the MTV series Total Request Live, was listed by Billboard in their weekly listings of the most-played videos in the channel, and peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot Single Sales. Larson went on tour with Jesse McCartney for Teen Peoples \\"Rock in Shop\\" mall concerts, opened for him during his Beautiful Soul tour, and also performed in New York City at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Even so, the album was not a success, selling only 3,500 copies. Larson later admitted to being disillusioned with her music career, saying, \\"I wanted to write all my own songs, and [the recording company] were afraid of that. I wanted to wear sneakers and play my guitar‚Äîthey wanted heels and wind blown hair.\\" In 2006, Larson was cast alongside Logan Lerman and Cody Linley in the comedy film Hoot, about young vigilantes trying to save a group of owls. It received poor reviews, but Ruthe Stein of San Francisco Chronicle was appreciative of Larson and Linley for bringing \\"a dash of Indiana Jones to their roles\\". She had a small part, the following year, in the Amber Heard-starring drama Remember the Daze, and she launched an arts and literature magazine, named Bunnies and Traps, for which she wrote her own opinion columns and accepted submissions from other artists and writers. Larson has said that she frequently considered giving up acting at that time, as she found it difficult to find much work, blaming it on filmmakers' inability to typecast her. She was particularly discouraged when she lost out on key roles in the films Thirteen (2003) and Juno (2007). To support herself, Larson worked as a club DJ.  United States of Tara and film breakthrough (2009‚Äì2014)  Larson at the London premiere of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World in 2010 In 2009, Larson began playing Kate Gregson, the sardonic teenage daughter of Toni Collette's character, coping with her mother's dissociative identity disorder, in the Showtime comedy-drama series United States of Tara. Portia Doubleday was initially cast in the role but was replaced with Larson after filming the pilot episode. Reviewing the first season for The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley took note of how well Larson played a \\"real teenager\\" and Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle credited her for finding nuance in her role. Larson has said that her character's journey to find meaning in life mirrored that of her own, and she was upset when the show was canceled after three seasons in 2011. Also in 2009, she starred alongside Rooney Mara in Tanner Hall, a coming-of-age film about four girls in boarding school. Despite disliking the film, Betsy Sharkey of Los Angeles Times commended Larson for providing \\"one of the film's funniest bits\\". In her two other film releases that year, she played a scatterbrained cheerleader in House Broken and a popular high schooler in Just Peck. At the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2010, Larson appeared in a stage production of Thornton Wilder's play Our Town. Directed by Nicholas Martin, it featured her in the role of Emily Webb, a precocious young girl. Reviewing the play for The Boston Globe, Louise Kennedy thought that the production had glossed over the play's darker themes and bemoaned the lack of tragic arc in Larson's character. In film, she featured in Noah Baumbach's comedy-drama Greenberg and Edgar Wright's comedy Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. A journalist for Slant Magazine opined that these films helped raise her profile, and Larson has said that the latter film, in which she played a rock star named Envy, marked a turning point in her career. In it, Larson performed the song \\"Black Sheep\\" with the band Metric. Although it did not do well commercially, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has since developed a cult following. She next played the troubled daughter of a corrupt cop (played by Woody Harrelson) in the drama Rampart (2011), an emotionally intense part she found herself unable to detach from. A confrontation scene between Harrelson and her proved upsetting for her; the director was surprised by how well it turned out and tweaked the script to further explore the father-daughter relationship. In 2012, Larson expanded into filmmaking by co-writing and co-directing the short film The Arm with Jessie Ennis and Sarah Ramos. The film, about societal expectations in the near future, won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. She featured as a seductive teenager in the critically panned drama The Trouble with Bliss, after which she played Molly, a high school student, in 21 Jump Street, an adaptation of the 1980s police procedural television series, co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Larson found her acting style to be more rigid than Hill's approach and was challenged by scenes that required her to improvise with him. Dana Stevens of Slate labeled Larson \\"a find of major proportions\\", adding that \\"she's not only beautiful but funny, with a scratchy contralto voice, and unlike the usual female in a buddy movie, she comes across as a real person\\". With worldwide earnings of over $200 million, 21 Jump Street proved to be Larson's most widely seen film to that point. Larson at the premiere of Short Term 12 at the 2013 South by Southwest Following an appearance in the sitcom Community, Larson collaborated with Dustin Bowser to co-write and co-direct Weighting (2013), a short film about a strained relationship, which was screened at South by Southwest. Larson's breakthrough came in the same year when she starred in Destin Daniel Cretton's critically acclaimed independent drama Short Term 12, which marked the first leading role of her career. Set in a group home for troubled teenagers, the film featured her as Grace, the emotionally distressed supervisor of the institution. To prepare, Larson interacted with staff in a children's home and watched online interviews of people with similar jobs. The film had a production budget of under $1 million, and she was pleased with its intimate and collaborative work environment. Larson's performance was acclaimed. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found her \\"terrific\\" and \\"completely persuasive\\", and Ian Freer felt that she \\"builds into a whirling dervish of a performance, making Grace strong but scarred, damaged but compassionate\\". Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph predicted that it would \\"[mark] her out for a stellar career\\". Larson received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead; she later remarked that the film prompted directors to offer her a wide variety of parts, but she turned down roles of the unidimensional love interest. Also in 2013, Larson had supporting roles in two romantic dramas, Don Jon and The Spectacular Now. In the former, written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, she played the sister of Don Jon (played by Gordon-Levitt). Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film's exploration of sexual themes and considered Larson to be \\"terrific\\" in it. In The Spectacular Now, starring Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, she was cast as Cassidy, the ex-girlfriend of Teller's character. Larson was drawn to the project due to the realism she found in its depiction of high school experiences. Writing for New York magazine, David Edelstein called upon viewers to admire \\"the shading and intelligence she brings to Cassidy\\". The 2014 crime drama The Gambler, based on the 1974 film of the same name, featured Larson as a literature student who has an affair with her professor (played by Mark Wahlberg), a gambling addict. The director Rupert Wyatt felt that the role was underwritten and cast Larson to lend heft to it. Even so, Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that the \\"talented Larson is given little to do, other than react\\".  Room and Marvel Cinematic Universe (2015‚Äìpresent)  Larson at the Japan premiere of Kong: Skull Island in 2017 Larson had three film releases in 2015. Her first appearance was in Digging for Fire, a largely improvised ensemble comedy-drama featuring Jake Johnson in the lead role. Filming took place without a script and Larson made several on-set decisions regarding her character's choices, including the removal of a planned romantic subplot involving her and Johnson. She next played the sister of Amy Schumer's character in the comedy Trainwreck, which was loosely based on Schumer's own life. Larson modeled her role on Schumer's sister, who served as an associate producer on the film. Tim Grierson of Screen International labeled the film \\"a deft blend of laughs, romance and poignancy\\" and found Larson to be \\"lively, [but] slightly underused\\". Trainwreck earned over $140 million against a $35 million budget. Larson next starred in Room, a film adapted from the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue. It featured her as Ma, a young woman held in captivity, who bears a child of rape. The role was physically and emotionally taxing for her, and she modeled it on her mother's struggle as a single parent. A large portion of the film was shot inside a 10 ft √ó 10 ft shed created in a studio, and Larson prepared herself by spending a month isolated in her apartment. She interacted with specialists on sexual abuse and researched the lack of nutrition that a person in captivity would suffer. To achieve the look, she stayed away from sunlight, modified her diet, and exercised extensively to lose weight. Larson collaborated closely with Jacob Tremblay, who played her son, and spent time performing activities that mirrored those of their characters. Room received acclaim, particularly for Larson and Tremblay's work. Los Angeles Timess Kenneth Turan called her performance \\"astonishing\\", adding that the \\"reality and preternatural commitment she brings to Ma is piercingly honest from start to finish, as scaldingly emotional a performance as anyone could wish for\\". She won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe and BAFTA in the same category. Following the success of Room, Larson played a leading role in Free Fire (2016), an action-comedy about a shootout in a warehouse. She agreed to the project to bring attention to gun violence. Eric Kohn of IndieWire remarked on how different Larson's role was from that of Room and added that her \\"businesslike demeanor once again proves her ability to command a scene with a single glare\\". Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $7 million investment. She had filmed a part in Todd Solondz's comedy Wiener-Dog, but it was cut out when Solondz found her character inessential to the story. The following year, Larson starred in the second installment of the MonsterVerse franchise, entitled Kong: Skull Island, co- starring Tom Hiddleston and Samuel L. Jackson. Filmed in Vietnam, the film featured her as a photojournalist in the 1970s. It marked her first big-budget project, and though she was glad to play a role not defined by her looks, she bemoaned the lack of female co-stars. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the film's visual effects and thought that \\"Larson manages to hold her own with very little to do\\". Kong: Skull Island was a commercial success, earning over $566 million worldwide. Larson promoting Captain Marvel in 2019 Later in 2017, Larson portrayed Jeannette Walls in The Glass Castle, an adaptation of Walls' memoir, which reunited her with Destin Daniel Cretton. It tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her nonconformist parents (played by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts). Larson was attracted to the complex depiction of a parent-child relationship and identified with its theme of forgiveness. She collaborated closely with Walls and her siblings and observed their mannerisms. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian disliked the film's sentimentality but noted that \\"it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson's presence\\". Also poorly received was the India-set musical romance Basmati Blues, a project she had filmed back in 2013, which received criticism on social media for its white savior narrative. The 2017 Toronto International Film Festival marked the release of Larson's feature film directorial debut, the comedy-drama Unicorn Store, in which she also starred. It was later picked for digital distribution by Netflix in 2019. She played a disillusioned art student fascinated with unicorns. Larson had unsuccessfully auditioned in 2012 to star in the film when Miguel Arteta was attached to direct. After the production was stalled, Larson was offered to direct and star in it. She was drawn towards the fanciful narrative and found a connection between her character's journey and her experience as a director. David Ehrlich of IndieWire disliked the film but took note of Larson's potential as a filmmaker. After a year-long absence from the screen, Larson starred as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film Captain Marvel (2019), which marked Marvel Studios' first female-led film. Though initially skeptical about taking on such a high- profile role, she agreed after viewing it as a platform to empower young women and found a connection with the character's flaws and humanity. In preparation for the role, she undertook judo, boxing, and wrestling training for nine months, and interacted with service personnel at the Nellis Air Force Base. Stephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that \\"Larson, a perceptive, low-key actor, carries the whole affair capably\\" and took note of how much she stood out in the film's quieter moments; David Sims of The Atlantic bemoaned the lack of depth in her role but commended the actress for effectively portraying her character's struggle for independence from authoritarian men. Larson reprised her role in Avengers: Endgame, which she had filmed before Captain Marvel. Endgame earned $2.79 billion worldwide to rank as the highest-grossing film of all time, and Captain Marvel became the first female-led superhero film to collect over $1 billion worldwide. Also in 2019, Larson teamed with Destin Daniel Cretton for the third time in Just Mercy, based on Bryan Stevenson's memoir about death row inmate Walter McMillian's wrongful conviction, starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx. She agreed to take on the supporting part of Eva Ansley, an advocate for the Equal Justice Initiative, to lend her support to Cretton's storytelling. Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman noted how well she channeled her character's \\"antsy, cigarette-smoking defensiveness.\\" The following year, Larson produced and appeared in an episode of The Messy Truth VR Experience, a virtual reality series, for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Interactive Program. =Upcoming projects= Larson has committed to reprise her role as Danvers in a sequel to Captain Marvel. She also has three upcoming projects for streaming television. She will serve as the producer and star as Victoria Woodhull, the first female presidential candidate in American history, in an eponymous biopic produced by Amazon Studios. Larson will also star in an Apple TV+ drama series based on the life of CIA officer Amaryllis Fox, and the Netflix film Lady Business, about challenges faced by female entrepreneurs.  Advocacy  Crystal + Lucy Awards in 2018 Larson is a gender equality activist and an advocate for sexual assault survivors. She uses her celebrity to speak on political and social issues, saying, \\"I'd put it all on the line and be an activist for the rest of my life because it doesn't feel right to me to be quiet\\". Following a performance by Lady Gaga at the 88th Academy Awards, in which several survivors of sexual abuse appeared with the singer, Larson hugged all of them as they exited the stage. At the following year's ceremony, Larson presented Casey Affleck with the Best Actor Award, but due to sexual harassment allegations against him in the past, she did not clap for him during a standing ovation from the audience; however, she did hug him; she later stated that her action spoke for itself. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. In the same year, she became one of the first actors to incorporate an inclusion rider provision in her film and press tour contracts. In an interview with Marie Claire, Larson spoke about diversity among film critics and journalists as she found them to be \\"overwhelmingly white male\\" and supported inclusivity. This comment led to trolling and review bombing of the Captain Marvel page on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2014, Larson teamed with Alia Penner to launch Women of Cinefamily, a monthly program to bring attention to films directed by and starring women, for the non-profit cinematheque Cinefamily, in which Larson served as an advisory board member. Following allegations of sexual assault against two of the company's male executives, she issued a statement in support of the victims and asked for action to be taken against the men. Larson became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2016, and was later among the finalists for the organization's board of governors. In 2017, she was one of several celebrities to raise funds for the Motion Picture & Television Fund, a charity that offers assistance to elderly members of the industry, and co-hosted an event for the Women in Film organization, during which she urged filmmakers to be vocal against the presidency of Donald Trump. She took part in the Women's March on Washington and criticized Trump's policies on transgender rights. At the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards in 2018, where she was honored, Larson bemoaned the lack of diversity among film reporters and called for better representation of minority voices in film criticism. She announced a 20 percent quota for underrepresented journalists at the Sundance and Toronto International Film Festival. In 2019, Larson served as a guest editor for Stylist magazine, and used the platform to bring attention to diversity and social inclusion. At the Women in the World Annual Summit, she spoke against the gender pay gap in Hollywood. Also in 2019, Variety honored her for her work with the Equal Justice Initiative. In 2020, Larson endorsed the defund the police movement. Personal life and media image Larson at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival Larson is reluctant to speak about her personal life and refuses to answer questions in interviews that make her uncomfortable. When asked about her desire to be private, she has said that she fears being judged for her flaws and has added that the privacy allows her to play a wide variety of roles without being typecast. Larson began dating Alex Greenwald, a musician and lead singer of the band Phantom Planet, in 2013, and they were engaged from 2016 to 2019. The couple lived together in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. She had credited Greenwald for creating a safe space for her and for empowering her to take risks in her work. Describing Larson's off-screen persona, Holly Millea of Elle wrote in 2016 that she \\"carries herself like an athlete, lean and solid, surefooted [and] yet her energy is warm and familial, literally embracing\\". Anne Helen Petersen of BuzzFeed finds her \\"incredibly warm\\" and adds that she is \\"a serious nerd, with the endlessly tunneling knowledge of a homeschooler\\". Jennifer Dickison of Porter writes that Larson's \\"fully formed\\" personality made it difficult to categorize her into a conventional slot. Larson has said that she is interested in films that illustrate the \\"human condition\\" and which \\"make people feel more connected to themselves [and] the rest of the world\\". She is drawn to roles that differ from her own personality and which involve themes of social activism. Fan Zhong of W magazine has identified a theme of \\"sex appeal, inner torment, and a quick, playful wit\\" in her characters. Lenny Abrahamson, who directed Larson in Room, believes that her craft has \\"none of that showy intensity that sometimes gets all the attention\\" and has said that her \\"awareness of tougher lives\\" empowers her performances. Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed her in Short Term 12 and The Glass Castle, has praised her ability to improvise, saying, \\"I never know what's going to happen, and often she doesn't know what's going to happen.\\" Larson maintains an active social media presence and uses it as a platform to share opinions and posts that she writes herself. In 2020, she started her own YouTube channel. She was featured by Forbes in their 30 Under 30 list of 2016 and was included by People magazine in their annual beauty list in 2016 and 2019. In 2018, she was named among the best American actors under 30 by IndieWire. In 2019, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax statue of Larson as Captain Marvel. In the same year, Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Acting credits and awards According to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes and the box-office site Box Office Mojo, Larson's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films are Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), 21 Jump Street (2012), Short Term 12 (2013), Don Jon (2013), The Spectacular Now (2013), Trainwreck (2015), Room (2015), Kong: Skull Island (2017), Captain Marvel (2019), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).

It is the third book in the Redwall series. It is also one of the three Redwall novels to be made into a TV series. Plot summary=Slagar the Cruel Mattimeo is a direct sequel to Redwall and Mossflower, taking place eight seasons (two years) after the events of the first novel. The peaceful woodland creatures of Redwall Abbey are busy preparing for a feast during the summer equinox. Matthias and Cornflower have had a son named Mattimeo, who has been generally spoiled throughout his life by the inhabitants of Redwall. Meanwhile, the masked fox Slagar the Cruel and his gang of slavers are planning to enter Redwall Abbey during one of their feasts. Slagar, a villainous fox craving revenge for a crime never committed against him, intends to capture slaves from Redwall and take them to an underground kingdom ruled by a mysterious, god-like figure named Malkariss to be sold as slaves. After drugging the Abbey residents, he kidnaps Mattimeo, Tim and Tess Churchmouse, Cynthia Bankvole, and Sam Squirrel. They meet Auma, (a young badger maid) and Jube, (a hedgehog), who were also kidnapped by Slagar the Cruel. Upon discovering the children missing, Matthias, Basil Stag Hare and Jess Squirrel with the help of a few friends, leave the Abbey to hunt down Slagar and return the children back home. They encounter Cheek, an ottercub Matthias describes as \\"Cheek both by name and by nature\\". US cover of Mattimeo On their journey, they meet up with Orlando the Axe, the father of Auma, and Jabez Stump, the father of Jube. As they journey, they find the Guerrilla Union of Shrews in Mossflower (Guosim), and convince them to aid the travellers on their quest. General Ironbeak Meanwhile, at the Abbey, a horde of rooks, magpies, and crows led by General Ironbeak have come to conquer it. They instantly capture most of Redwall, starting from the top and working their way down. Then, Baby Rollo, Cornflower and Mrs. Churchmouse get kidnapped by the rooks, but the remaining Abbeydwellers manage to capture the Magpie brothers Quickbill, Diptail and Brightback with drugged strawberries, courtesy of Sister May. When the magpies went to forage for food for Ironbeak's crew, they ate the strawberries. The two forces then negotiate a hostage exchange. After that, the Abbey's residents take refuge in a basement called Cavern Hole, stocked with many supplies. Then Cornflower has an idea to dress up as a ghost and scare the rooks; they succeed, but General Ironbeak doesn't fall for the trick. He traps Constance in the gatehouse, then slips his army through the barricade. Malkariss After a long journey up cliffs, fighting a horde of archer rats, and crossing a desert and a gorge, Matthias's gang finally arrive at the underground kingdom of Malkariss, where Slagar has been trading his slaves. There, the heroes fight the massive army of rats, while Matthias frees the slaves held there and is reunited with his son. Then while they fight Matthias fights a large fiend called the Wearet and is thrown off a walkway into a pit where he confronts Malkariss who is revealed to be an ancient and somewhat repulsive polecat. Malkariss is about to kill Matthias with his own sword when the tyrant's slaves appear and destroy their master by pelting him with the stones and rocks which they had been using to build. Matthias frees the slaves and a great battle ensues during which Malkariss' kingdom is destroyed and his minions defeated. Later, Slagar reappears and kills Vitch, a rat slaver he worked with. Matthias and Orlando attempt to kill Slagar, who flees, only to plunge to his death down a well shaft.

Biography Irit Linur was married to Alon Ben David, Senior Defense Correspondent for Israel Channel 10 and Middle East Correspondent for Jane's Defence Weekly. Literary career Linur started her writing career as a satirical columnist in local newspapers. Her first full-length novel was The Siren's Song, a best-selling romantic comedy set on the background of the Scud missile attacks on Tel-Aviv during the Gulf War in 1991. In 1994, the book was adapted into a feature-length film directed by Eytan Fox. The title refers to the air-raid sirens which sounded almost every night during the six weeks of the war. It is the story of an assertive professional woman who experiences emotional growth and romance. At the same time, the book is critical of Tel Aviv's superficial lifestyle. Linur's second novel, Two Snow Whites, is about a photographer who finds herself involved in a murder case. Sandler Ella, her third novel, depicts the glamorous life of media broadcasters. Her fourth novel, The Brown Girls, was adapted as a popular television mini-series. Linur has also published a book of humorous essays, The Secret Blonde. Linur is a co-host on the radio show \\"The Final Word\\" on Galei Zahal, Israel's Military Radio. The show would initially pair a liberal and a conservative who'd discuss current events, with Linur playing the liberal part. However, in recent years she has expressed views hostile to liberal groups, left-wing politicians and minorities in Israel. In 2002, Linur called for a boycott of Haaretz newspaper until it fires left-wing journalists Amira Hass and Gideon Levy. In April 2019, Linur apologized on the air after she and her co-host insinuated that a journalist's wife, a public attorney, was the source behind his news reports concerning PM Netanyahu's investigations. In May 2019, referring to a protest, which featured both Jewish and Muslim speakers, including Israeli Arab politician, MK Aymen Odeh, Linur commented offensively on the air that the protest would have been better off, had Aymen Odeh been replaced by two gas station workers as the representatives of the Israeli Arab public.

Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley before becoming a group leader during the Manhattan Project. He was born in 1907 in Harvard, Illinois. He graduated with a BS from the University of Illinois in 1929 and received his PhD in physics from the University of Michigan 1934. He was a lecturer at Columbia University and later professor at the University of Illinois from 1937 to 1942. He married Kathleen (Kay), and had two daughters: Kim Manley of Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Kathleen Manley of Greeley, Colorado By the time World War II broke out, Manley was at the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory. In 1942, his friend and colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, held a meeting with several leading theorists at UC Berkeley. The topic of the meeting: develop preliminary plans to design and build a nuclear weapon. Manley, one the attendees, was tasked with learning more about the properties of fast neutrons. Less than a year later, the center of the project had shifted to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Manley received a personal call from Leo Szilard to move from the Metallurgical Laboratory to Los Alamos and on April 4, 1943, Manley arrived at the laboratory. Manley spent his first days in Los Alamos working with other newcomers on the construction of laboratory buildings. He also installed a Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator, which he had brought with him from Urbana. Throughout the war Manley served as one of Oppenheimer's principal aides, with particular responsibility for laboratory management. His wife Kay moved to Los Alamos in June 1943, following the birth of their second daughter. She was hired as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division but then quit after six months to focus on raising their children. After the war, Manley left Los Alamos to serve as executive secretary of the general advisory committee for the Atomic Energy Commission, a federal agency charged with managing the nation's atomic assets. After leaving the AEC, he returned to Los Alamos as assistant director for research. In 1946, Manley served as associate professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis for a semester. From 1951 to 1957, Manley taught physics at the University of Washington. He retired in 1974, and died in 1990 in Los Alamos at age 82. See also * Lawrence Badash, J.O. Hirschfelder, H.P.

It officially began on June 15, and lasted until November 15, although activity occurred both before and after the season's limits. The season was active with fourteen total storms, six of which developed into hurricanes; four of the hurricanes attained major hurricane status, or a Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Carol, although by the time it struck Atlantic Canada it was much weaker. Both hurricanes Barbara and Florence struck the United States; the former crossed the Outer Banks and impacted much of the east coast, and Florence struck a sparsely populated region of the Florida Panhandle without causing much damage. Bermuda was threatened by three hurricanes within two weeks. In addition to the hurricanes, Tropical Storm Alice developed in late May and left several fatalities in Cuba. The final hurricane of the season, Hazel, produced additional rainfall in Florida after previous flooding conditions. There were several unnamed storms, the last of which dissipated on December 9\\\\.

After weakening over land, Alice re-intensified over the western Caribbean, moving over western Cuba on May 21 with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). On June 1, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and later executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba. Alice quickly weakened due to a cold front, and advisories were discontinued by June 3. While near Cuba, Alice produced drought-breaking rainfall that caused flooding and several unofficial drowning deaths. After passing near Cuba, Alice turned to the north and restrengthened to peak winds of , possibly even stronger to hurricane intensity. Alice again weakened before making landfall near Panama City Beach on June 6 as a minimal tropical storm, and dissipating shortly thereafter. Alice brought heavy rainfall to Florida, peaking at in Lake Placid. Near where it made landfall, the storm dropped light rainfall, and there were no reports of damage in the state. Alice was the first North Atlantic tropical cyclone to have a female name. It was also one of 22 tropical or subtropical cyclones on record in the month of May. Tropical Storm Two A tropical depression developed over southwestern Florida on July 11\\\\. It moved northeastward toward a trough across northern Florida. The depression intensified into a tropical storm on July 12 and reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). On July 15, the storm began interacting with a nearby cold front, signaling that it transitioned into an extratropical storm. On the next day, the storm brushed Nantucket with 31 mph (50 km/h winds before the storm was absorbed by the front. Hurricane Barbara A tropical wave developed into Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August 11\\\\. It intensified as it moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane by the next day, and reaching peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) just south of Cape Hatteras on August 13\\\\. Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August 15\\\\. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August 16. Before Barbara struck the Outer Banks, officials ordered evacuations for a few islands, and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the region. Wind gusts reached at Hatteras and Nags Head. Torrential rainfall fell across the state and extended northward into Virginia, peaking at near Onley along the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Across the region, the hurricane left flooding and downed trees, some of which survived the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944. Monetary damage from Barbara was estimated around $1.3 million (1953 USD, $ USD), mostly from the crop damage. Newspaper reports indicated there were seven deaths in the country; two additional deaths occurred offshore Atlantic Canada when a dory sunk. Hurricane Carol On August 28, a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near Cape Verde. After moving west-southwestward, it turned to the northwest, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 31 and into a hurricane on September 2\\\\. Passing northeast of the Lesser Antilles, Carol rapidly intensified to Category 5 intensity, reaching peak winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) on September 3, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened, bypassing Bermuda on September 6 and producing high waves. Carol later turned to the north-northeast, brushing Cape Cod and causing boating accidents across New England. Four people were killed in the region. Fishing losses totaled around $1 million (1953 USD, $ USD). After bypassing New England, Carol brushed western Nova Scotia before moving ashore near Saint John, New Brunswick as a minimal hurricane. As it moved ashore, it produced hurricane conditions in eastern Maine, one of only six Atlantic hurricanes to do so. In Nova Scotia, several boats were wrecked or washed ashore, with one drowning death reported. High seas caused coastal flooding, while strong winds downed large areas of trees. Heavy losses to the apple crop occurred in Annapolis Valley, totaling $1 million (1950 CAD, $ USD). Carol later dissipated southwest of Greenland on September 9\\\\. Tropical Storm Five On August 29, a tropical storm developed over southern Florida. While moving through the state, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, reaching at Fort Lauderdale Beach; similar rainfall was observed in the northern Bahamas. Described by one Weather Bureau forecaster as \\"wide and flat\\", the storm gradually organized over the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 31, the storm turned to the northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The system weakened to a tropical depression before moving ashore near Savannah, Georgia on September 1\\\\. It dissipated that day over land. Hurricane Dolly The origins of Dolly were from a tropical wave that moved through the eastern Caribbean Sea, producing in Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The rains closed schools and government buildings around San Juan, Puerto Rico, and flooding was reported in Guayama, Yabucoa, and Patillas. On September 8, a tropical storm developed north of Puerto Rico, which moved slowly west-southwestward before turning to the north. It quickly intensified, and after Hurricane Hunters reported an eye, Dolly reached hurricane status on September 9\\\\. At that time, hurricane warnings were issued in the Bahamas, although the storm turned away from the archipelago. It intensified to peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) on September 10, as reported by aircraft. Dolly weakened as it accelerated northeastward, although it still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds. As a result, the United States Air Force ordered all of the planes on the island to fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September 11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September 12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September 17\\\\. Hurricane Edna Shortly behind Dolly, another tropical wave spawned a tropical depression over the Lesser Antilles on September 15. As it moved through the region, it produced unsettled conditions across the northeast Caribbean. Edna quickly intensified as it tracked northwestward, attaining hurricane status on September 15 and peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) the next day. After peaking, the hurricane turned to the northeast and maintained most of its intensity for a few days. It passed just north of Bermuda early on September 18 with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), before beginning a steady weakening trend as it accelerated. By September 19, Edna completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone, lasting another day before dissipating west of Ireland. Before Edna struck Bermuda, the islanders were well-prepared due to being previously impacted by hurricanes Carol and Dolly, and they boarded up their homes. The hurricane caused \\"considerable damage\\", with wind gusts reaching . The winds downed trees, blocking roads, and also caused disruptions to the power and water services. During its passage, Edna produced heavy rainfall and also damaged several roofs. There were three injuries on the island. Tropical Storm Eight A tropical depression formed in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 15 and moved northeastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats. The storm reached peak winds of 50 mph (75 km/h) while moving in a small clockwise loop southeast of Louisiana. The storm weakened into a tropical depression on September 17, but re-intensified to a tropical storm three days later. On September 20, the storm moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and dissipated the next day over the state, bringing of rainfall to coastal areas. Hurricane Florence Florence developed on September 23 near Jamaica from a tropical wave. While passing that island, it produced heavy rainfall that blocked roads. It intensified to hurricane status on September 24 while passing through the Yucat√°n Channel, and while doing so left heavy damage in western Cuba. After turning north and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Florence quickly intensified to peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). It gradually weakened before making landfall on September 26 as a minimal hurricane in a sparsely populated region of the Florida Panhandle. Before Florence hit the United States Gulf Coast, about 10,000 people evacuated Panama City, Florida, and the Weather Bureau issued timely warnings that was credited in preventing any deaths or major injuries. Winds reached at Eglin Air Force Base, and the heaviest rainfall was in Lockhart, Alabama. The combination of winds and heavy rainfall left crop damage in the Florida panhandle and southeastern Alabama, although coastal damage was not severe. Overall, 421 houses were damaged and another three were destroyed, with monetary damage estimated around $200,000 (1953 USD, $ USD). After landfall, Florence quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and as it continued across the southeastern United States it produced moderately heavy rainfall. It dissipated on September 28 southeast of New England. Hurricane Gail On October 2, a tropical wave spawned a tropical depression about 815 mi (1310 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gail, and the next day, a ship encountered the storm, reporting a minimum pressure of 986 mbar (29.12 inHg). As the ship crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status. Initially, the Weather Service believed that Gail dissipated and a new storm formed in the same region on October 5, but a reanalysis in 2015 indicated that they were the same storm. The confusion resulted from Gail turning to the northeast on October 4, steered by an approaching trough. On October 6, Gail turned back to the west-northwest, remaining a moderate tropical storm for several days. On October 11, the cold front that absorbed Hurricane Hazel turned Gail to the north, and absorbed it the next day in the central Atlantic. Tropical Storm Eleven On October 3, a tropical storm developed near the southern coast of Cuba. It moved northwestward, crossing the island before turning to the northeast. Early on October 5, the storm brushed southeastern Florida, producing gusty winds and rainfall. The threat of the storm prompted small craft warnings from the Florida Keys through South Carolina. As it accelerated northeastward, the storm strengthened slightly to maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h), before becoming extratropical on October 6\\\\. Two days later, the remnants moved over Atlantic Canada with winds of 70 mph (120 km/h), producing flooding rainfall that washed out several roads. The storm caused two deaths after it wrecked a boat in Broad Cove, Nova Scotia. Later, the cyclone passed south of Greenland before dissipating southwest of Iceland on October 10\\\\. Hurricane Hazel The twelfth tropical storm and the final hurricane of the season formed in the Yucat√°n Channel on October 7\\\\. Given the name Hazel, the storm tracked north-northeastward, then northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico while gradually intensifying. On October 9, Hazel strengthened into a hurricane made landfall just north of Fort Myers, Florida at its peak intensity of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm crossed the state in about six hours, during which it weakened slightly back to a tropical storm. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, Hazel re-intensified to its peak winds, although by late on October 10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm between North Carolina and Bermuda. The remnants continued northeastward, dissipating southeast of Newfoundland on October 12. On Sable Island, the storm produced heavy winds and rain. Due to the fairly light winds across Florida, damage from Hazel was minor, estimated around $250,000 (1953 USD, $ USD). During its passage, the storm spawned a tornado in St. James City that destroyed several homes, and there were indications of another tornado in Okeechobee City. The primary impact from Hazel was from its rainfall, peaking at in Daytona Beach. The rains added to previous flooding conditions across the state, causing a record flood stage along the St. Johns River that flooded of highway. Overall flooding damage was estimated up to $10 million (1953 USD, $ USD), but it was impossible to determine how much was due to Hazel. Tropical Storm Thirteen A tropical storm developed from a dissipating cold front on November 23, about 460 mi (740 km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on November 24\\\\. It later turned sharply to the west as it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November 26 about 450 mi (725 km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land. Tropical Storm Irene The final tropical cyclone of the season developed on December 7 about 705 mi (1735 km) east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles, from the end of a dissipating cold front. Given the name Irene, the storm moved to the northwest and later to the west. Based on ship observations, it is estimated that Irene intensified to a peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) on December 8, before weakening the next day. Late on December 9, Irene dissipated about 270 mi (435 km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Storm names These names were used to name storms during the 1953 season. The list was the same for the 1954 season as well. Initially, all female names were used; it was not until the 1979 season that male and female names were used in alternating order. Names that were not assigned are marked in . All storm names were named for the first time. No names were retired, because the World Meteorological Organization only started to retire storm names in the next year, 1954. { style=\\"width:80%;\\"  *Alice *Barbara *Carol *Dolly *Edna *Florence *Gail *Hazel  *Irene    } See also *List of Atlantic hurricanes *List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes ReferencesExternal links * Monthly Weather Review * On the formation of Tropical Storm Alice, 1953 Articles which contain graphical timelines ","title":"1953 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"1339290","text":"The Coltzin petroglyph, located approximately 65 km north of Mazatl√°n, Mexico, is approximately 8 m in diameter, carved into a cliff.

The martial prowess of the young warrior greatly impressed Ding Yuan, who made him Chief Secretary and kept him close at side. In 189, Emperor Ling died. The General-in-Chief He Jin then summoned Ding Yuan into the capital Luoyang with his regional troops to assist in the power struggle against the eunuch faction. Before Ding Yuan arrived, however, the eunuchs assassinated He Jin. Dong Zhuo, a warlord from Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û; present-day western Gansu) who was also summoned by He Jin, arrived in Luoyang ahead of Ding Yuan and defeated the eunuchs, grasping military control of the capital. After Ding Yuan arrived, Dong Zhuo managed to buy over L√º Bu, who killed Ding Yuan and presented the latter's head to Dong Zhuo. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms A Qing dynasty illustration of L√º Bu murdering Ding Yuan. The 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a romanticisation of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. In Chapter 3, Ding Yuan becomes a rival of Dong Zhuo after he opposes the latter's plan to depose Emperor Shao in favour of Emperor Xian. However, Dong Zhuo refrains from killing Ding Yuan on the spot because Ding Yuan's foster son, the formidable warrior L√º Bu, is protecting him. Li Su, an official under Dong Zhuo who is from the same commandery as L√º Bu, then volunteers to persuade L√º Bu to defect to Dong Zhuo's side. Bringing along a famous steed named Red Hare and other luscious gifts, he meets L√º Bu at his camp outside the city. Attracted by the gifts and feeling convinced by Li Su, L√º Bu agrees to betray his foster father and defect to Dong Zhuo's side. That very night, L√º Bu barges into Ding Yuan's tent, decapitates him and brings his head as a present to Dong Zhuo the following day.

Said to be the largest such facility in the world, it is located northwest of Minneapolis-St. Paul near the town of Albertville along Interstate 94 (I-94). Minnesota is a good site for such a project, as the state experiences some of the largest seasonal swings in temperature in the United States, and has a spring freeze‚Äìthaw cycle that can heavily damage roadways. More than 4,500 sensors are embedded in and under the road surfaces to measure stresses while the test segments are in use. The facility was constructed from 1990 through 1993 at a cost of $25 million and opened in 1994. It earned an Award of Merit in the Federal Highway Administration's 1996 Excellence in Highway Design competition. A stretch of the Interstate is redirected onto test pavement at the site, and a test track simulating a low- volume rural roadway loops through the facility. Real highway traffic is used for this mainline test area, but traffic is simulated on the low-volume road by a semi-trailer truck. A bypass is available to shift traffic off the mainline testing area so researchers can closely examine the pavement without disrupting flow on the highway. Many different organizations have partnered with Mn/DOT to conduct research at the facility, ranging from partners such as the University of Minnesota, Federal Highway Administration, and Wisconsin Department of Transportation to others like the National Road Administration of Finland.

Biography=Early life Charles L. Grant was born in Newark, New Jersey. He received a B.A. from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1964 and taught for four years. Then, from 1968 to 1970, Grant served in the U.S. Army military police in Vietnam and was awarded a Bronze Star. Career From 1973 to 1977, Grant was Secretary of Science Fiction Writers of America. In 1987-1988, he served as President of the Horror Writers Association. Grant won a World Fantasy Award for his novella collection Nightmare Seasons, a Nebula Award in 1976 for his short story \\"A Crowd of Shadows\\", and another Nebula Award in 1978 for his novella A Glow of Candles, a Unicorn's Eye, the latter telling of an actor's dilemma in a post-literate future. Grant also edited the award- winning Shadows anthology, running eleven volumes from 1978-1991. Contributors include Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, Al Sarrantonio, R.A. Lafferty, Avram Davidson, and Steve Rasnic and Melanie Tem.

Grant wrote twelve books (eight novels and four collections of four related novellas each, with interstitial material) set in the fictional Connecticut town of Oxrun Station. Three of these were intentionally pastiches of classic Universal and Hammer horror films, and feature a vampire, a werewolf, and an animated mummy.

Taxonomy The African manatee was officially declared a species under the Trichechus senegalensis taxon in 1795 by naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. No subspecies of this taxon are known. Although African manatees live in both coastal areas and isolated inland areas, genetic evidence suggests no significant differences between the two populations. The African manatee falls under the genus Trichechus with only two other species, the Amazonian manatee and the West Indian manatee, which are also sirenians. Range and habitat African manatees can be found in West African regions: Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Manatees are found in brackish waters to freshwater: in oceans, rivers, lakes, coastal estuaries, reservoirs, lagoons, and bays on the coast. African manatees rarely inhabit waters with a temperature below Manatees have been found as far as offshore, where there are shallow coastal flats and calm mangrove creeks filled with seagrass. Inland lakes where manatees dwell include Lake Volta, the Inner Niger River Delta in Mali, Lake L√©r√©, and Lake de Tr√©n√©. Due to fluctuating flow rates and water levels in rivers, some of these permanent lakes serve as refuges for manatees in connecting rivers during the dry season. From north to south, the river systems that contain manatees include: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mans√¥a, Geba, Buba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavalla, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Como√©, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Katsena Ala, Bani, Akwayafe, Rio del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logon√©, Mit√©m√©l√©, Gabon, Ogou√©, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Congo, Dande, Bengo, and Cuanza. Manatees move up these rivers until they are unable to proceed because of shallow waters or strong waterfalls. The areas with the highest manatee populations are Guinea-Bissau, the lagoons of C√¥te d'Ivoire, the southern portions of the Niger River in Nigeria, the Sanaga River in Cameroon, the coastal lagoons in Gabon, and the lower parts of the Congo River. As part of a study completed in C√¥te d'Ivoire to assess where the majority of African manatees favor living, a sample of African manatees was radio-tagged and tracked. The tracking observed most of the sample in coastal lagoons, mangroves, and other herbaceous growths. They were also found in the grassy estuaries of big rivers with mangroves and in protected coastal spots with less than of water containing both mangroves and marine macrophytes. Diet Manatees are herbivores; however, they also eat clams, mollusks, and fish found in nets.Keith Diagne, Lucy. (2014). Phylogenetics And Feeding Ecology Of The African Manatee, Trichechus senegalensis. The percentage of the diet that is composed of non-plant material varies based on location, with manatees living off the coast having a lifetime average of 50% non-plant material. The West African manatee is the only sirenian that seems to intentionally consume non-plant material. A majority of the African manatee's diet is made up of a variety of flora found above or hanging over the water. African manatees that inhabit rivers mostly eat the overhanging plants growing on the river banks. The diet of African manatees living in estuaries consists solely of mangrove trees. Each day, the African manatee eats about four to nine percent of its body weight in wet vegetation. Microorganisms within the African manatee's large intestine, which measures up to in length, aid it in digesting the large quantity and variety of vegetation that it consumes daily. Description African manatee on land Skull of an African manatee The African manatee's body is widest at the middle, and its tail resembles a paddle. The manatee is gray in color with small, colorless hairs that cover its body. However, algae and other tiny organisms often grow on an African manatee's body, so its body sometimes appears brown or greenish in color. Calves are darker in color when they are very young. African manatees measure up to in length, and weigh about . African manatees are typically extremely slow, moving between 4.8 km and 8.0 km (3 and 5 mi) per hour, although when scared by predators they can travel at speeds of about per hour. The African manatee's large forelimbs, or flippers, are used to paddle and to bring food to its mouth. Vegetation is then chewed by the manatee's strong molars, which are its only teeth. When the manatee is born, each jaw has two vestigial incisors, which the manatee loses as it matures. If the African manatee's molars happen to fall out, new molars grow in their place. The manatee's flippers, which have nails, are also used to graze other manatees. The African manatee does not have any hind limbs. From the exterior, the African manatee looks very similar to the American manatee; however, the African manatee is different from the Amazonian manatee, which has characteristic white markings on its abdomen. Evolution and legends The West African manatee is a descendant of trichechids found in coastal South America during the Pliocene Epoch. Although they tend to stay in freshwater, theory suggests that, through transoceanic currents, the species reached West Africa during the late Pliocene. The West African manatee's appearance is thought to be the result of these currents and species movement. The African manatee's ancestors passed down advantageous migration and food traits. The African manatee is not restricted to a certain area, and does not have to rely heavily on only one ecosystem for support. This evolution of the African manatee's diversity may be part of its key attribute to survival. They are more diverse than other manatees due to their ability to survive in salt water, although they do need access to fresh water for drinking purposes. According to people of western Africa, Maame Water (also spelled Mami Wata), a recurring character in many coastal legends, is a goddess of the sea and a symbol of wealth and beauty. Maame Water also flips over canoes and entices their occupants to visit her kingdom. Scientists from the Institute of Aquatic Biology of the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Wildlife Department in Ghana have concluded that Maame Water is not a sea goddess, but actually the West African manatee. According to Dr. Mamaa Entsua-Mensah, who performs research for CSIR, when female African manatees surface for air, they resemble goddesses. Entsua-Mensah explains that the female manatee's breasts create the illusion of a woman-fish. Among the Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, the manatee is regarded as sacred and highly respected, because in the Serer creation myth, it is viewed as the guardian of the secrets of the future.Senghor, L√©opold S√©dar, \\"Chants d'ombre\\" [in] \\"Selected poems of LEOPOLD SEDAR SENGHOR\\", CUP Archive, pp. 103, 125 Behavior The African manatee is nocturnal. They tend to travel silently, eat, and be active towards the end of the day and during the nighttime. During the daytime, the African manatee dozes in shallow (1 to 2 meter deep) water. In countries such as Sierra Leone, African manatees migrate upstream when flooding occurs in June and July. This flooding can lower the availability of food for the manatees as well as lower the salinity of waterways. African manatees live in groups of 1 to 6. They have very few natural predators, two of which are sharks and crocodiles. They are also very social, spending a majority of their day bonding by touch, verbal communication, and smell. This creates a deep bond between them. When it is time to migrate due to a weather change, manatees will travel in larger groups to find warmer water and food. Reproduction The sex of an individual African manatee can only be determined by close examination of the manatee's underside. The only visible distinction between males and females is the genital openings. However, males tend to be smaller than females. Some female African manatees are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age, and they give birth every 3 to 5 years of their estimated 30-year lifespan. Males take a longer time to mature (about 9 to 10 years) and can rarely fertilize an egg at the age of 2 or 3 years. African manatees breed year-round. When males and females mate, it is not monogamous; multiple males will usually mate with one female. When the opportunity to mate with a female is at stake, males will fight with each other by pushing and shoving. Female African manatees give birth to one calf at a time after about a 13-month pregnancy. Calves can swim on their own at birth. Although the African manatee's social organization is not well understood, research shows the most common and tightly knit bonds are between a mother and her calf. Threats The African manatee is a vulnerable species because of its meat, oil, bones, and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. Specifically they are used to make walking sticks and toy spinning tops. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and they are sometimes shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries will notice manatee meat being sold on the streets and in marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement protects the poachers from punishment. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. There are even more threats to the African manatees' habitat and life: urban and agricultural development, increased damming, and increased use of hydroelectric power in the rivers of countries like C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The building of dams has led to genetic isolation of some populations. There is little data to show if this has any negative long-term effects on the population as a whole. At several hydroelectric dams including the Kanji dam on the Niger River and the Akosombo dam on the Volta River manatees have been caught and killed in the turbines and intake valves. Thick congestion of boats in waterways may cause the manatees to have deadly run-ins with the vessels. However, even natural occurrences, such as droughts and tidal changes, can often strand manatees in unsuitable habitats. Some are killed accidentally by fishing trawls and in nets which are intended for catching sharks. Some behaviors of African manatees provoke humans to hunt them. When manatees become tangled in fishing nets, they can damage them. People in countries such as Sierra Leone believe that killing the manatees to reduce the species size lowers the chances of the fishing nets requiring expensive repairs. In addition, African manatees can destroy rice crops by drifting into fields during the rainy season. Many of the African manatees that venture up the Niger River starve to death. At certain times each year, the Niger River dries up due to the hot temperatures and lack of rain. Many manatees migrate there during the rainy season. When the water dries up the manatees are unable to get to other bodies of water. Conservation From November 2004 until December 2007, the West African Manatee Conservation Project completed Phase I. During this phase, residents of six African countries (Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone) created a database of previously unknown information about the species (such as population, economic value, and habitat range) by conducting surveys in their countries. Other African countries also contributed reports that broadened the collective knowledge of the African manatee. Because of the work done during this phase, the general public, young children, and experienced scientists alike are receiving better information than ever before as to how to protect the African manatees. Phase I also allowed for up-close examination of the African manatee's way of life through field work. Due to the large-scale success of Phase I, a Phase II is to be enacted by Wetlands International. During Phase II, the information collected in Phase I will be even more widely distributed around the areas in which the African manatee lives. Phase II will focus on furthering the existing research and adjusting legislation and education. According to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the African manatee is endangered. CITES states that trade in any species on the list, including the African manatee, is to be carefully monitored and terminated. Laws exist to protect the African manatee in every country in which it lives, but these laws are not well enforced. Due to this mass lack of enforcement and minimal education, the African manatee population is being steadily depleted.

Bluefields was the capital of the protectorate. Bluefields is the capital of the South Caribbean Autonomous Region in Nicaragua. It was also the capital of the former Zelaya Department, which was divided into North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions. It is located on Bluefields Bay at the mouth of the Escondido River in the municipality of the same name. Bluefields was named after the Dutch pirate Abraham Blauvelt who hid in the bay‚Äôs waters in the early 17th century. It has a population of 87,000 (2005) and its inhabitants are mostly Mestizo. Minority groups include Afro-descendant Creoles, and indigenous Miskitu, as well as smaller communities of Garifuna, White People, Chinese, Mayangnas, Ulwas, and Ramas; that is the reason why English is the most spoken language in the city's urban area. Bluefields is the chief Caribbean port, from which hardwood, seafood, shrimp and lobster are exported. Bluefields was a rendezvous for English and Dutch buccaneers in the 16th and 17th century and became capital of the English protectorate over the Mosquito Coast in 1678. During United States interventions (1912‚Äì15, 1926‚Äì33) in Nicaragua, US Marines were stationed there. In 1984, the United States mined the harbor (along with those of Corinto and Puerto Sandino) as part of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Bluefields was destroyed by Hurricane Joan in 1988 but was rebuilt. History The origin of the city of Bluefields is connected with the presence of European pirates on the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast, subjects of powers at the time hostile to Spain. These pirates used the Escondido River to rest, to repair damages and to be provisioned. By then, the territory of the present municipality was populated by the native towns of Kukra and Branch. In 1602 one of these soldiers of fortune chose the bay of Bluefields as his center of operations due to its tactical advantages, a Dutchman named Blauvelt, and from him originates the name of the municipality. Black Africans first appeared in the Caribbean coast in 1641, when a Portuguese ship that transported slaves wrecked in the Miskito Cays. From the original settlement the bay began to be populated; the English subjects burst in 1633 and from 1666 they were already organized into colonies, and by 1705 there were authorities established. In 1730 the Kingdom of Mosquitia came to depend on the British government of Jamaica. For this, an alliance with the Miskito people was decisive, and the British provided them with armaments that allowed them to subdue the other ethnic groups of the Caribbean coast‚Äîthe Afro-descendant Creoles and the indigenous Mayangnas, Ulwas, and Ramas. In 1740 the Miskitos yielded to British sovereignty over the territory, and in 1744 a transfer of British colonists was organized from Jamaica to the Mosquito Coast; they brought along with them black slaves. French citizens were also installed. The area was a British Protectorate until 1796, when Britain recognized the sovereignty of Spain on the Mosquito Coast; the British subjects also abandoned the islands, but the Spaniards did not take firm positions in them. With the independence of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the area of the Mosquito Coast became part of Gran Colombia until its dissolution in 1831. Thereafter it became part of the Republic of New Granada, now Colombia, until, through the Esguerra-B√°rcenas Treaty, the Colombian state formally ceded the territory to Nicaragua. The Moravian Church was installed in 1847, and in 1860 the Miskito Reserve was created in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, by an agreement between the British and American governments in which Nicaragua as a country did not have part, and the British crown intervened again, putting it under its protection. The city of Bluefields was declared capital of that Reserve. On the other hand, slaves originating in Jamaica that sought freedom on the Nicaraguan coast continued arriving during the greater part of the 19th century. The plan of ‚ÄúEuropeanization‚Äù of the natives was completed by the 1880s, when British and Americans expanded the production of bananas and wood, creating an enclave economy; by the 1880 Bluefields was already a city of cosmopolitan character, with an intense commercial activity. Economic growth also brought a marked process of social differentiation, by which the races and ethnic groups were distributed spatially and in terms of work: the white population represented the interests of the foreign businesses; those of mixed race worked as artisans and in working-class occupations; the darker-skinned Creoles had their niche in physical work, and the native population were employed as servants and for other smaller works. In 1894, the government of Nicaragua incorporated the Miskito Reserve into the national territory, extinguishing the Miskito monarchy, and on October 11, 1903, Bluefields was proclaimed capital of the Department of Zelaya. In recent years, however, due to US Coast Guard patrols attempting to intercept Colombian drug smugglers, cocaine (often referred to locally as \\"white lobster\\") has become an important part of the local economy. When threatened with potential boarding by US Coast Guard ships, cocaine smugglers try to dispose of their illegal cargo by throwing it overboard, simultaneously lightening their load for a faster escape and eliminating the evidence in case of capture. A percentage of the cocaine bales used to be carried by ocean currents into the lagoon around Bluefields. Residents may find the bales washed up on the beach or seek them by boat in the lagoon or at sea. In recent years this is not that common any more due to stricter legislation. Bluefields remains a deeply impoverished city with extremely high rates of unemployment.  Climate  According to K√∂ppen climate classification, Bluefields features a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen Af). There is a drier period from February to April, but the trade winds ensure that unlike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, rain still falls frequently during this period. For the rest of the year when tropical low pressure dominates rainfall is extremely heavy, helped by the coast being shaped in such a manner as to intercept winds from the south as prevail during the northern summer. Districts The city is located beside the eponymous bay; consisting of 17 neighborhoods including the port of El Bluff, located on a peninsula of the same name. Due to gradual erosion, the peninsula is becoming a true island that closes the Bay of Bluefields on the east side. El Bluff has an extension of 1.29 km¬≤ and it is about 8 km from Bluefields.

Education There are currently two universities in Bluefields. One is the Bluefields campus of the University of the Autonomous Regions of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast, and the other is the Bluefields Indian and Caribbean University (BICU).bicu.edu.ni/ Transportation and infrastructure Until recently, there was no road access to Bluefields from the west coast of Nicaragua. There is now a highway from Nueva Guinea with regular bus service. The road was completed in May 2019, and was financed with loans from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. The road was formally declared open by President Daniel Ortega. Visitors usually either fly in to Bluefields Airport or take a bus from Managua and other cities or take a Panga down the Rio Escondido from the city of El Rama, which itself is accessible from Managua by bus. In the town, taxis are readily available at a fixed price of 14 cordobas per person (2020) and work on a shared basis. The municipal wharf is the home of commercial boat traffic to Corn Island, LaBarra and many other locations which are only accessible by boat. Car ownership is very limited in Bluefields. The municipal government does not provide all necessary services, so additional services related to water, energy, and sanitation are provided by non-governmental organization BlueEnergy.

Frye, a member of the Republican Party, spent most of his political career as a legislator, serving in the Maine House of Representatives and then U.S. House of Representatives, before being elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served for 30 years; dying in office. Frye was a member of the Frye political family, and was the grandfather of Wallace H. White, Jr. and the son of John March Frye. He was also a prominent member of the Peucinian Society tradition. Fry was a leader of the \\"Old Guard\\" faction of conservative Republicans, exerting his weight on such important committees as Rules, Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Commerce. He was best known for supporting the shipping industry, but repeatedly failed to obtain government subsidies. He also supported high tariffs, expansion that sought additional territory and the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. He favored the annexation of Hawaii and the acquisition of the Philippine Islands in 1898. President William McKinley appointed him to the peace commission it negotiated the end of the Spanish-American war.Lewis L. Gould, \\"Frye, William Pierce\\" American National Biography (1999) Biography Mrs. William P. Frye Frye was born in Lewiston, Maine, in Androscoggin County. He attended public schools there and graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick in 1850. Frye studied law and was later admitted to the bar. He began practicing in Rockland, Maine in 1853 but later returned to Lewiston, and practiced law there. Frye played a role in founding Bates College in Lewiston and served as a longtime trustee of the College. Frye received a LL.D. from Bates in 1881. Frye served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1861 to 1862 and again in 1867. He was later elected as the mayor of Lewiston, holding that position from 1866 to 1867, when he became the state attorney general. Frye left the attorney general post in 1869. He was elected as a Republican in 1870 to the U.S. House of Representatives. Frye served in the 42nd Congress and the five succeeding Congresses from March 4, 1871, to March 17, 1881, when he resigned after being elected Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James G. Blaine. He served over 30 years in the Senate (March 18, 1881 ‚Äì August 8, 1911), and was reelected in 1883, 1889, 1895, 1901, and 1907. During his tenure in the Senate, Frye served as its President pro tempore from the 54th‚Äì62nd Congress. The Vice Presidency was vacant twice during that time: November 21, 1899‚ÄìMarch 4, 1901, following the death of Garret Hobart, and September 14, 1901‚ÄìMarch 4, 1905, after Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency. Frye resigned as president pro tempore due to ill health a couple of months before his death. Electing his successor proved difficult for the Senate, as the Republicans, then in the majority, were split between progressive and conservative factions, each promoting its own candidate. It took several months for a consensus way forward to emerge. At the time of his resignation he had served longer in that position then anyone else, 15 years, 2 months, 21 days. Frye was also the chairman of the Rules Committee (47th‚Äì49th Congress). Frye also was a member of the Commerce Committee (50th‚Äì62nd Congress) and a member of the commission which met in Paris in September 1898 to adjust the Treaty of Paris between the United States and Spain, ending the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Senator Frye was a charter member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution when it was founded in 1890. Frye died in Lewiston in 1911.

It takes place in a fantasy world where humans have been suffering from the attacks of the demon-like Vandels. (\\"Vandel\\" is a portmanteau of \\"vampire and \\"devil\\".\\"On the Beet.\\" Sh≈çnen Jump Volume 2, Issue 11. November 2004. Viz Media. 8.) Humans can fight back by becoming a Vandel Buster, a paid monster and Vandel assassin. The protagonist of the story, Beet, is a young boy who becomes a Vandel Buster to be like his heroes, the Zenon Warriors. The manga was published in Shueisha's Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump in Japan from 2002 until September 2006, when Inada became ill. On December 17, 2015, it was reported that the manga will resume in the Spring 2016 issue of Jump SQ.Crown. The manga ran in Jump SQ. Crown until October 2016 and it is currently published in Jump SQ.Rise. Viz Media published the first twelve volumes in English. An anime adaption was produced by Toei Animation and Dentsu and aired on TV Tokyo. It ran for 52 episodes, followed by a sequel, Beet the Vandel Buster: Excellion, which ran for 25 episodes. The anime was licensed in North America by Illumitoon Entertainment, who only released one DVD containing 4 episodes with an English dub track. Conception and development Sanjo and Inada described the partnership as a \\"50/50 between the know-how from the long years we've been a team, and tackling new difficulties.\\" Story The story is set in the \\"Dark Ages\\", a term referring to the time since Vandels appeared and started attacking humans. Beet is a boy who dreams of joining the \\"Zenon Warriors\\", a group of \\"Vandel Busters\\" who are considered to be the strongest on the continent. When the group comes to protect his village from the Vandel, Beltorze, Beet tries to join them but is rejected. When Beltorze appears, the Zenon Warriors seem to have the upper hand until Beet cheers them on, causing the Vandel to notice his presence. Beltorze attacks Beet, and the Zenon Warriors are forced to break formation to help him. Beltorze uses that moment to attack again, which mortally wounds all of them. Hidden in the smoke, the Zenon Warriors decide to rescue Beet‚Äôs life by putting their life force into their ‚ÄúSaiga‚Äù and giving them to Beet. When Beet complains and asks them why they are doing this, it is revealed that Zenon is Beet‚Äôs brother. The now weaponless Zenon Warriors then emerge from the smoke and continue to attack Beltorze. When Beet regains consciousness, both Beltorze and the Zenon Warriors are gone. Guilt-ridden and sad, he cries and vows to destroy all the Vandels and end the Dark Ages. He then goes on a three-year training expedition. His childhood friend, Poala, who Beet keeps impressing that she is going to marry him, later joins Beet and they form the ‚ÄúBeet Warriors‚Äù. As the story continues more is learned about the fight between the Zenon Warriors and Beltorze and the fantasy world of Beet is expanded on. The manga series had been on hiatus since September 2006 because of Koji Inada's sickness. It went off hiatus and starting published again in spring 2016 but went on hiatus again later that year.  Main characters  ; Beet: The fifteen-year-old protagonist of the story, Beet is the leader of his own group of Vandel Busters, called the Beet Warriors. His dream is to end the dark century, and to kill all the vandels so they will stop killing humans. At the beginning of the series, he received five Saiga from the members of the Zenon Warriors, which are his major weapons in fighting vandels. He is strong when fighting monsters and Vandels but is weak when fighting humans. He also keeps mentioning that Poala will be his future wife. ; Poala: Beet's childhood friend, and the second person to join the Beet Warriors. She is a beautiful girl mentioned by Kissu and some other busters. Though beautiful, she is also an intelligent and wise girl, but often lets her anger towards others get the best of her. Poala is shown to be quite good with fire tengeki, but has trouble controlling its raw power. She is fairly skilled in tengeki. She is also known among Vandel Busters as Beet's future wife. ; Slade: Slade is a Vandel Buster and a rival of Beet's whom he has known since his training journey. Like Beet, he is highly skilled in the use of spears, which has been developed by the 120 bouts he and Beet have fought. His main weapon is Wind Tengeki, which makes up his saiga, the Silent Grave. Despite his outward attitude towards Beet, he cares for him, but also believes he is too naive. He is also a friendly rival with Beet and hopefully a new member for the Beet Warriors. ; Milfa: Milfa is a Broad Buster (BB) who is very upbeat, big fan of the Zenon Warriors and has a dream to either marry Zenon, Beet, or Kissu. She may even become a new addition to the Beet Warriors. She is especially skilled in the Lightning Tengeki, which also makes up her saiga, the Lightbolt Grasper. ; Kissu: An old friend of Beet. He is a genius and master of tengeki, using his abilities to rival even the strongest busters. He is trying to redeem himself in his eyes and the eyes of Beet for teaming up with a Vandel, and Beet's biggest enemy, Grunide. ; Zenon: Beet's older brother and leader of the Zenon Warriors. His saiga is the holy Excellion Blade, which was passed onto Beet. Upon meeting Cruss, Beet learns that Zenon used \\"the power beyond saiga\\" to handle Beltorze before being sucked into a dimensional rift. His current state and whereabouts are unknown. ; Laio: Member of the Zenon Warriors. Laio's fiery saiga is the Burning Lance, which was passed onto Beet. Taught Beet how to fight with the spear. After the encounter with Beltorze, his whereabouts became unknown. ; Cruss: Member of the Zenon Warriors. Handsome and skilled with the power of water, uses the saiga 'Crown Shield' which he passed onto Beet. He had lost his memory until after the battle with the Vandel Garownewt. Told Beet what he remembered about the fight with Beltorze and helped him sharpen his skills with the Crown Shield saiga. ; Bluezam: Member of the Zenon Warriors. To match his immense size, he wields the Boltic Axe, which was passed onto Beet. After the encounter with Beltorze, his whereabouts became unknown. ; Alside: Member of the Zenon Warriors. His saiga is the Cyclone Gunner, which was passed onto Beet. After the encounter with Beltorze, his whereabouts became unknown. ; The Winged Knight: A buster who saves Beet's life when he encounters Garownewt. He also teaches Beet how to properly wield the saiga within him. His presence is an enigma, yet he seems to know the Zenon Warriors somehow. Terms ; Busters : Vandel Busters are often called Busters. To become a Buster, one applies at the Buster \\"house\\" to get a brand that indicates their level. Elders have the special ability to scan a buster's eye to prove kills and advance levels. Levels are similar to RPG game level systems in that the more monsters or Vandels one kills, the higher one's level. Levels are represented in Roman numeral like characters that represent numbers, with each line representing a level. The buster's level is more a reflection of how much they have done, rather than how strong they are. Elders also give monetary rewards for slaying Vandels and Monsters, allow for the formal formation of groups, and give information. Each \\"house\\", in each town, is under the jurisdiction of the Busters Association. (Similar to the vandel hotel) : Busters can work either individually or in groups. Buster are policed by a group known as the Broad Busters, commonly referred to as BB, and must have at least a minimum level of 40. Busters fight with Divine attack (energy in the forms of Air, Fire, Light, Thunder, and Water), or their own individual Saiga (A magic weapon made of divine energy), the ultimate weapon used to fight evil. Normally, a Buster is not able to produce a Saiga until they have mastered a certain level of divine attack. ; Tengeki : Tengeki (called \\"Divine Power\\" in the English manga) is the main weapon that only vandel busters can use. It is described as \\"the ability to grasp heaven\\" because no one else besides busters can use it. The ability to use tengeki is activated when one first becomes a buster and receives their buster branding. Tengeki is assorted in five categories: fire, water, wind, lightning, and light. Each element is more powerful than another but weak against another. The order goes water puts out fire, fire \\"burns\\" through wind, wind cuts through lightning, and lightning shocks water. Light isn't included in this because light is its own separate element and does not exist in the natural world. Below is a list of each tengeki and a summary of them overall. :Fire Tengeki: The Divine Power of Fire is characterized by its explosiveness and ability to burn through anything. Common attacks are fireballs, long bursts of flame, and focusing the flame into various shapes. Fire can also be focused through weapons to extend the user's reach of where the flame hits. The highest level of attack, called \\"burst end,\\" focuses and compresses the fire tengeki into a ball that causes an enormous explosion when hit against something. Divine Fire is the best style for close range attackers, and it is the most commonly seen style among busters. Examples of Fire Saiga are Beet and Laio's Burning Lance and Jiiku's Blaster Edge. Most Fire Saigas are regular weapons that focus fire around the weapon, increasing the damage it can cause. :Wind Tengeki: The Divine Power of Wind is characterized by two things: its ability to cut and slice through vandels, and its ability to blow away monsters. Common attacks are creating blades of air focused to various degrees, which can slice through objects. Another common attack is to create tornadoes and hurricanes, which can blow opponents away. Wind Tengeki can also be focused through a weapon, either increasing its cutting ability or extending its reach. A high level attack, called Linear Gust, focuses Wind Tengeki to a great degree and the tengeki pushes through a monster's body, piercing it and exploding from within its body. Divine Wind can also be focused by skilled users around the body, which results in a shield of wind all around the user. A high level defense technique is to focus the Wind in the normal way of a shield, but is focused so that when a vandel comes within reach of the shield, the air will slice up the vandel. Wind is mainly used in mid to long range attacks, but it can also be used at close range. Wind Saigas are commonly shown to compress air for attacks, like Alside's Saiga Cyclone Gunner, which uses compressed balls of air for ammo. A close range example would be Slade's Saiga Silent Gaive. Silent Gaive is a spear compressed to the limits, so it can cut through virtually any vandel. Wind is the second most common element seen. :Water Tengeki: The Divine Power of Water is very flexible and flowing. The most common attack for Divine Water is to focus the water into ice, and fire it at opponents, which leaves them frozen. Afterwards, they can be smashed into smaller pieces. Ice is also commonly focused into different shapes, like knives or needles, which are thrown at the opponent. A very high level attack associated with this is to focus the water in the air above the monster into needles, which can drop on the opponent. Another common attack is to focus and compress water into various shapes (most commonly seen is a stream of water) and fire it at opponents. This will either push the opponent back, or if focused enough, grind through the opponent. A high level attack, developed by Kissu, is called Frozen Wave of Divine Blue, which is a highly compressed arrow of ice tengeki. When it hits an opponent, it goes right through them, freezing them completely and destroying them in the process. Less commonly seen techniques, only associated with water, are healing powers. By focusing the water tengeki on a wound, highly skilled users can heal injuries. An example of a Water Saiga is Cruss's and Beet's Saiga Crown Shield. This shield is called \\"strongest shield in the world,\\" and it deserves that reputation. It can block many powerful attacks, and like water, it flows from offense to defense. If the user needs to attack (which is not very often, considering that it is a shield saiga), it can transform into a ball with a very very long chain attached to it, which can pound vandels into the dirt. Beet used this technique to kill the Phantom Beltorze. Another side technique associated with the crown shield is that it can cure poison by using water tengeki to push poison out of the body. Because of these techniques, water can be used for close range and long range attacks. However, it is mainly used for midrange attacks. Divine Water is the 4th most commonly seen tengeki. :Lightning Tengeki: The Divine Power of Thunder is characterized by its supersonic speed, repulsion/attraction of the electromagnetic force, eye blinding brightness and unpredictable movement. Common attacks include focusing lighting in the hand and throwing it like a ball, or conducting it through a weapon to increase its damage. Skilled users can focus their lighting tengeki in the air, causing lighting to hit opponents. A unique defensive technique shown by Milfia is to conducting lighting on yourself, super charging your body. This createa a rather nasty shock when anyone touches you, be it friend or foe. This technique is dangerous for those who are not very skilled, because if one messes their control of lighting it could go throw your body and stop your heart. Like other elemental saiga, lighting saiga have more than one side to them. For example, Beet's and Bluezam's Boltic Axe appears to be just a giant golden axe, but there is more to the saiga than that. The axe is easily capable of cutting through bedrock, which makes it handy for killing vandals. When Beet swings the axe, he is capable of letting out a condensed form of lighting tengeki that can cut through hard boulder. However, its greatest ability lies in the axe itself. When Beet's life is in mortal peril, a seal in the axe opens up, and begins to suck anything and everything in the area into the void, acting as a black hole. This technique is so powerful, it drove off three seven star vandels from the area in seconds. Another example of a lighting saiga is Milfia's Lightbolt Grasper. Basically a giant pair of pinchers, this saiga is able to grasp enemies and hold them down, making it easier for teammates to attack. In extreme situations, Lightingbolt Grasper is able to clamp onto enemies and drive stakes from the saiga into the ground. Then, Milfia fires off an incredibly condensed ball of electricity, which can be controlled to move vandels hundreds of feet into the sky. ; Vandels : The Vandels are creatures that have a demonic appearance and whose sole purpose seems to be terrorizing humanity. Vandels have a base called the vandel hotel located at the end of the world. The dark house of sorcery is responsible for creating Monsters for the Vandels who order them as well as giving money and marble shaped ‚ÄúStars‚Äù for killing humans and destroying towns. They also provide fortress construction for Vandels, luxuries, etc. The Vandels pay for monsters that they order and other things through dark currency (Humans use MG coins). : Vandels can use dark attacks to attack. Like Divine attacks, they can come in several forms: fire, water, wind, lightning, and sorcery. Vandels control the dark power with their horns, which is the hardest part of the vandel's body. If the horn of a powerful vandel is severed, the uncontrolled dark power will accumulate inside his body. The moment the vandel dies, it cause an explosion that is five times as powerful as a first-class dark attack. : Vandels start out with one ‚ÄúStar‚Äù and like levels, more work is required to gain one Star if the Vandel already has several. Supposedly, the first Vandel to obtain eight Stars will become the new leader of the Vandels. The stars shatter when a Vandel is killed. : Each Vandel's body is different, granting them all manner of unique abilities; weapon generation, monster storage, and being able to regrow an entire body from a golf ball sized \\"core\\" just to name a few. There is also much more variation in the first class dark attacks then in their divine counterpart. Rozzgoat's version of Inferno looks like a giant centipede of fire with one eye but another Vandel's Inferno would look completely different. : \\"The Eyes of Darkness\\" are the gods and creators of the Vandels. Outside of Shagi and some of the other workers at the vandel hotel, their existence appears to be unknown. ; Encyclopedia of Monsters : All the monsters a Vandel can order are listed in this encyclopedia. It is also divided into sections like trees, caves, bogs, etc. The stronger the monster the more expensive it is. Low level monsters are like animals in both intelligence and appearance. They do not take instruction. They just obey instinct. Higher level monster are much smarter and/or stronger but do not reproduce naturally. They must either develop from weaker monsters, or be purchased. : In the past, Vandels could make their own monsters. Grineed, \\"The Clever Honcho of Deep Green\\" rediscovered the lost knowledge of creating monsters so that he no longer had to buy them from the Vandel Hotel. He died before passing on his knowledge. : Monsters can be \\"special ordered\\". This means that they have abilities beyond what is normal for that kind of monster. An example is Dangol, a protector bug with human speech and intelligence, who served Grineed as a personal assistant and punching bag/stress release device. Another is Hazan, Beltorze's Hound Knight, who was created in response to a demand for \\"a strong monster who will not be a burden.\\" : There are two basic philosophies on monsters. Some Vandels like to buy large numbers of cheap monsters while others prefer a small number of powerful monsters. ;Saiga :Saiga are the trademark weapons of Vandel Busters. They are created from a Vandel buster's divine force, and are generally gained in levels 30 and up. A Saiga is a Vandel Buster's soul, and is best wielded by the owner or another who wields said Saiga with the whole of their soul. A Vandel Buster's Saiga can be transferred to another Vandel Buster, or even a normal human to save their life. Upon it being transferred, that person can wield the Saiga at their own will, regardless of their prior training as a Vandel Buster, or lack thereof. Each Vandel Buster can only have one Saiga from their soul, unless the Saiga of another Vandel Buster is transferred to him or her. The Saiga reflects the owner's fighting style, abilities, and overall soul. It also seems to represent the imagination and cleverness of the user. For example, in episode, a seemingly dumb man used a divine fire saiga in the shape of a sword, which doesn't have any unique properties besides a regular fire saiga. On the other hand, Slade's saiga represents his cleverness by making it invisible and being incredibly thin. Saiga can have several different forms, which can allow a Vandel Buster to fight in many different situations. For example, Cruss' Saiga Crown Shield is a shield, which can turn into a flail- like weapon for offense. Another example is Alside's Saiga Cyclone Gunner, which can change into different forms: a regular gun, a sniper mode, and a blade for close combat. : The five saiga of the Zenon Warriors are: :* The axe \\"Boltic Axe\\", the saiga of Bluezam, :* The shield \\"Crown Shield\\", the saiga of Cruss :* The sword \\"Excellion Blade\\", the saiga of Zenon, :* The spear \\"Burning Lance\\", the saiga of Laio :* The gun \\"Cyclone Gunner\\" the saiga of Alside Reception As of April 4, 2018, the first 13 volumes of the manga had 4 million copies in print.

The agency's major activities are grouped into two programs, the Federal-aid Highway Program and the Federal Lands Highway Program. Its role had previously been performed by the Office of Road Inquiry, Office of Public Roads and the Bureau of Public Roads. History=Background The organization has several predecessor organizations and a complicated history. The Office of Road Inquiry (ORI) was founded in 1893. In 1905 that organization's name was changed to the Office of Public Roads (OPR) which became a division of the United States Department of Agriculture. The name was changed again to the Bureau of Public Roads in 1915 and to the Public Roads Administration (PRA) in 1939. It was then shifted to the Federal Works Agency which was abolished in 1949 when its name reverted to Bureau of Public Roads under the Department of Commerce. With the coming of the bicycle in the 1890s, interest grew regarding the improvement of streets and roads in America. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded everywhere. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal-aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the Bureau of Public Roads, in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair high-priority item. Concrete was first used in 1893, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s. Federal aid began in 1917. From 1917 through 1941, 261,000 miles of highways were built with federal aid, and cost $5.31 billion. Federal funds totaled $3.17 billion, and state-local funds were $2.14 billion. Creation The FHWA was created on October 15, 1966. In 1967 the functions of the Bureau of Public Roads were transferred to the new organization. It was one of three original bureaus along with the 'Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety' and the 'National Highway Safety Bureau' (now known as National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Functions The FHWA's role in the Federal- aid Highway Program is to oversee federal funds used for constructing and maintaining the National Highway System (primarily Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways and most state highways). This funding mostly comes from the federal gasoline tax and mostly goes to state departments of transportation. FHWA oversees projects using these funds to ensure that federal requirements for project eligibility, contract administration and construction standards are adhered to. Under the Federal Lands Highway Program (sometimes called \\"direct fed\\"), the FHWA provides highway design and construction services for various federal land-management agencies, such as the Forest Service and the National Park Service. In addition to these programs, the FHWA performs and sponsors research in the areas of roadway safety, congestion, highway materials and construction methods, and provides funding to local technical assistance program centers to disseminate research results to local highway agencies. The FHWA also publishes the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is used by most highway agencies in the United States. The MUTCD specifies such things as the size, color and height of traffic signs, traffic signals and road surface markings. Organization The Federal Highway Administration is overseen by an administrator appointed by the President of the United States by and with the consent of the United States Senate. The administrator works under the direction of the Secretary of Transportation and Deputy Secretary of Transportation. The internal organization of the FHWA is as follows: *Administrator **Executive Director ***Office of Infrastructure ***Office of Research, Development, and Technology ****Public Roads magazine ***Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty ***Office of Policy and Government Affairs ***Office of the Chief Financial Officer ***Office of Administration ***Office of Operations ***Office of Safety ***Office of Federal Lands Highway ***Office of Chief Counsel ***Office of Civil Rights ***Office of Public Affairs Long-Term Pavement Performance Program Long- Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) is a program supported by FHWA to collect and analyse road data. The LTPP program was initiated by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Research Council (NRC) in the early 1980s. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) with the cooperation of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) sponsored the program. As a result of this program, FHWA has collected a huge database of road performance. FHWA and ASCE hold an annual contest known as LTPP International Data Analysis Contest, which is based on challenging researchers to answer a question based on the LTPP data.  Every day counts initiative  The Every day counts initiative (EDC) of the FHWA planned in 2009 and started in 2011 is designed as the United States road infrastructure project of the 2010s decade to identify and deploy innovation aimed at reducing project build delivery time, enhancing safety and protecting the environment. It also made a positive impact in accelerating the deployment of innovations. Five steps were scheduled from 2012 to 2020 and include various technologies and methods to improve travel time, safety, project and contract management, saving energy, risks, cost and environment resources. It started with reducing fuel consumption and improving travel time reliability by Adaptive traffic control, continued with implementing alternative intersections design and several money savings and anti-corruption strategies like independent reviewing of construction plans before construction is paid, also time saving strategies like right-of-way, on site bridge constructions as rapid bridge replacement.

Franzese was enrolled in a pre-med program at Hofstra University, but dropped out to make money for his family after his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967. He eventually helped implement a scheme to defraud the federal government out of gasoline taxes in the early 1980s. By the age of 35, in 1986, Fortune Magazine listed Franzese as number 18 on its list of the \\"Fifty Most Wealthy and Powerful Mafia Bosses\\". Franzese had claimed that at the height of his career, he was making up to $8 million per week. In 1986, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges, released in 1989, rearrested in 1991 for a parole violation, and ultimately released in 1994. Soon after, he retired to California and is now a motivational speaker and writer.  Early life  Franzese was born on May 27, 1951, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, to John \\"Sonny\\" Franzese, a Colombo crime family underboss, and Cristina Capobianco-Franzese, although Michael had initially questioned his actual biological father. Franzese had initially believed that he had been adopted by John after his mother divorced Frank Grillo, who Franzese thought to be his biological father. Michael claims he had gone by the name \\"Michael Grillo\\" until he was 18 years old. However, it was later discovered that John, already married with three children, had gotten the 16-year-old Capobianco, a cigarette girl at the Stork Club in Manhattan, pregnant with Michael, so Capobianco married Grillo to avoid having a scandal surrounding having a child out of wedlock. After the mob allowed John to divorce his first wife, Grillo disappeared, and he married Capobianco. Franzese later moved to Long Island. After finishing high school, Franzese entered a pre-med program at Hofstra University in 1969; his father originally did not want him to be involved in organized crime. However, in 1971, Franzese decided to drop out of college to help his family earn money when his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967. Franzese became acquainted with his father's friends such as Joseph Colombo, and later became inducted as a made man on Halloween night 1975. Franzese took the blood oath alongside friend Jimmy Angelino, Joseph Peraino Jr., Salvatore Miciotta, Vito Guzzo Sr., and John Minerva ‚Äî all of whom died violently over the next 20 years.COLOMBO ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILY ACTING BOSS, UNDERBOSS, AND TEN OTHER MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES INDICTED\\" Department of Justice press release June 4, 2008 Although Franzese recounts this ceremony had taken place in 1975, the membership books reportedly were not reopened until 1976 (they had been closed since 1957). Franzese was briefly mentored by Colombo soldier Joseph \\"Joe-Joe\\" Vitacco (1927‚Äì1980). During the late 1970s, Franzese met with Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, who was then a soldier. Angelo Ruggiero was also present. Franzese was contacted by a flea market owner who complained that his partner was using and selling drugs at the market in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Franzese agreed to frighten him and become the new partner. Franzese sent Colombo soldier-turned informant Anthony Sarivola and another member who remains unidentified. Gotti however claimed that the scared-off partner was an associate of his. After several meetings, Franzese proposed to buy Gotti out. Gotti replied, \\"Buy me out? I buy you out,\\" and handed over $70,000. Franzese later expressed admiration for Gotti, citing his strict gangster lifestyle and his overwhelming ego. In 1980, Franzese had become a caporegime of a crew of 300.  Gasoline bootlegging  In 1980, Franzese was contacted by Lawrence Salvatore Iorizzo, who initially thought of a scheme to defraud the federal government out of gasoline taxes. Iorizzo was being hassled by associates of another crime family and promised Franzese a percentage if he would defend and solve the issue. The pair set up 18 stock-bearer companies based in Panama. Once authorities suspected one company of fraudulent activity, Franzese would move onto the next company. Under law at the time in Panama, gasoline could be sold tax-free from one wholesale company to the next. Iorizzo, who later turned informant and testified against Franzese, craved power. As a result of Iorizzo slapping around Shelly Levine over $270,000 debt, Franzese had to cut in Genovese family soldier Joseph \\"Joe Glitz\\" Galizia into his operation. He partnered with the Russian Mafia in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in the gas scheme. The family would collect the state and federal taxes, but keep the money instead. At the same time, they were often selling the gas at lower prices than at legitimate gas stations. In 1986, Fortune Magazine listed Franzese as number 18 on its list of the \\"Fifty Most Wealthy and Powerful Mafia Bosses\\". Franzese had claimed that at the height of his career, he was making up to $8 million per week. He bought a home in Delray Beach, Florida.  Entertainment, sports management and other businesses  During the 1970s, he began to enter the world of legitimate business and by the mid 1980s Franzese had a stronghold on various businesses such as car dealerships, leasing companies, auto repair shops, restaurants, nightclubs, a contractor company, movie production and distribution companies, travel agencies and video stores. By 1980, Franzese was a partner with booking agent Norby Walters in his firm. Franzese's role was to intimidate existing and prospective clients. In 1981, Franzese successfully extorted a role for Walters in the US tour by singer Michael Jackson and his brothers. In 1982, the manager for singer Dionne Warwick wanted to drop Walters as an agent; Franzese met with the manager and persuaded him to keep Walters. In 1983, the FBI launched an investigation into boxing promoter Don King's organized crime connections and targeted Franzese to introduce an FBI undercover agent, using the alias Victor Quintana, to King. Franzese, who had never met King, says he was introduced to him by civil rights leader Al Sharpton. Franzese claimed he first met Sharpton through Genovese crime family mobster, Daniel Pagano. Quintana was to give the impression that he was buying his way into the boxing world in order for King to reveal his criminal associations, however the investigation subsequently collapsed after Quintana failed to follow through with several hundred thousand dollars. In 1985, Walters set up a sports management agency with Franzese as a silent partner. At a meeting he agreed to hand over $50,000 in return for a 25 percent interest from the sports agency.  Indictment and prison  In April 1985, Franzese was acquitted of racketeering charges. In December 1985, Franzese was one of nine people indicted on 14 counts of racketeering, counterfeiting and extortion from the gasoline bootlegging racket, and on March 21, 1986, pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of tax conspiracy. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and ordered to pay over $14 million in restitution, agreeing to sell his mansion in Old Brookville, New York and use proceeds from the 1986 film he produced, Knights of the City. Franzese had met his future wife Camille Garcia while shooting the film in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, in 1984. In 1989, Franzese was released from prison on parole after serving 43 months. On December 27, 1991, Franzese was sentenced in New York to four years in federal prison for violating the probation requirements from his 1989 release. Franzese had been arrested in Los Angeles on a tax fraud accusation and was sent back to New York for the probation hearing. In court, prosecutors complained that Franzese had only started paying the balance of his court- ordered restitution payments earlier that year. Franzese was also later subpoenaed to testify at Walters' trial in 1989, as Walters had invoked his name to frighten college athletes into signing management contracts, including Maurice Douglass, allowing him to get a reduced sentence. Prosecutors have said that Franzese was not considered by the government to be a federal cooperating witness. While imprisoned in 1991, Franzese became a born-again Christian after he was given a Bible by a prison guard. He also spent time in solitary confinement. He was ultimately released on November 7, 1994, retiring from the mob in 1995 by moving to California with his wife and children; the relocation was also a result of receiving multiple death threats and contracts on his life, including one approved by his father.  Motivational speaker and writer  In 1992, Franzese co-authored his first book, an autobiography, Quitting the Mob. In the book, Franzese discusses his criminal activities, life with his father, and meeting his second wife Camille Garcia. Since his release in 1994, Franzese has publicly denounced the life of organized crime, and became a motivational speaker for youth, at schools, and other venues. He also frequently speaks at Christian conferences and churches, including helping the Willow Creek Community Church, in November 2016, to give each of the 70,000 inmates in the state of Illinois a Christmas package. Franzese also speaks at prisons throughout the world, such as Pentonville Prison in England. In 2016, he vowed to help Christian refugees fleeing the Middle East. Franzese has also been interviewed on several radio, TV and online platforms. On July 23, 2002, while appearing on the HBO television program Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, Franzese claimed that during the 1970s and 1980s, he persuaded New York Yankees players who owed money to Colombo loansharks to fix baseball games for betting purposes. The Yankees organization immediately denied Franzese's accusations. In 2003, Franzese published Blood Covenant, an updated and expanded life story. He appeared in the 2013 Inside the American Mob, a National Geographic documentary. As of 2017, Franzese lives in Anaheim, California and is the father of seven children. As of 2020, he is the author of six books: Quitting the Mob (1992), Blood Covenant (2003), The Good, the Bad and the Forgiven (2009), I'll Make You an Offer You Can't Refuse (2011), From the Godfather to God the Father (2014), and Blood Covenant: The Story of the \\"Mafia Prince\\" Who Publicly Quit the Mob and Lived (2018).  Media appearances  Franzese was portrayed by Joseph Bono in the Martin Scorsese film Goodfellas (1990). In April 2013, a documentary called The Definitive Guide To The Mob was released by Lionsgate, with Franzese as commentator. In June 2013, the National Geographic Channel released a six-part series called Inside the American Mob, in which, as among other story lines, Franzese's climb up the ranks in the Colombo family is chronicled. His biopic, God the father, was released in theaters and cinemas across the United States on October 31, 2014. In March 2015, he appeared in a two-part documentary on the American Mafia with television presenter and reporter Trevor McDonald. He spoke about his wealth, but also the impact of being a member of the Colombo crime family had on his family, and that was why he turned away from organized crime. Franzese hosted a stage musical, A Mob Story, at the Plaza Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. The show opened in October 2018 and was created and directed by Jeff Kutash. In July 2020, he appeared in the Fear City: New York vs The Mafia Netflix docuseries.

At their height in 1920, they constituted 43% of Hawaii's population. They now number about 16.7% of the islands' population, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. The U.S. Census categorizes mixed-race individuals separately, so the proportion of people with some Japanese ancestry is likely much larger.US Census 2000: .  History =Final voyage of the Inawaka-maru The first known arrival of Japanese to the Kingdom of Hawaii came on May 5, 1806, involving survivors of the ill-fated ship Inawaka- maru who had been adrift aboard their disabled ship for more than seventy days. The Inawaka-maru, a small cargo ship built in 1798 in Osaka, was owned by Mansuke Motoya. The Inawaka-maru started its final voyage from Hiroshima to Edo (modern Tokyo) on November 7, 1805. The ship had been chartered by the Kikkawa clan to deliver mats, horse feed, and two passengers, Kikkawa officials. Her crew consisted of Captain Niinaya Ginzo, Master Ichiko Sadagoro, Sailors Hirahara Zenmatsu, Akazaki Matsujiro, Yumori Kasoji, and Wasazo, a total of eight aboard. The Inawaka-maru had to turn back, and restarted her journey on November 27. She arrived in Edo on December 21, started back to her home port stopping in Kanagawa, Uraga, and Shimoda, and left on her final leg ‚Äì from Shimoda across the Enshunada Sea ‚Äì on January 6, 1806. The Inawaka-maru was caught by a snowstorm that turned to rain and winds battered the ship eastward into the Pacific Ocean. On January 7 the crew cut down the mast because of the strong winds. On January 11 two rocky islands were sighted but no attempt was made toward them. These would be the last land before the Hawaiian Islands. On January 20 the water stores were empty, but the men collected rain water to survive. On February 28 the rice provisions ran out. On March 15 a flying fish landed in the ship and the men fished to sustain themselves. On March 20 the Tabour, an American ship Captained by Cornelius Sole, rescued the men of the Inawaka-maru. He found them begging for food by gesturing to their stomachs, mouths and bowing, found the galley empty, and understood their ordeal. He had the possessions of the survivors brought aboard his ship and salvaged parts and items aboard Inawaka-maru. Captain Sole had the survivors fed, over a span of five days, small portions to a progression to three normal meals a day, the remedy for starvation. On May 5, 1806, the Tabour docked in Oahu, Hawaii. Captain Sole left the eight Japanese in the care of King Kamehameha I. Captain Sole also left the anchor of the Inawaka-maru, 40 axes, and other items as payment for the Kingdom's hospitality. The King delegated the responsibility for the Japanese to Kalanimoku who had 50 men construct a house on May 6 for the Japanese. It took four days to build and a cook and two guards assigned to the house, which attracted crowds to these men of a different ethnicity. On August 17 the Japanese left Hawaii aboard the Perseverance to Macau on October 17. From there they took a Chinese ship to Jakarta on December 25. In Jakarta they fell ill and five died there or on the voyage to Nagasaki where they arrived on June 17, 1807, where another died. At the time of the Sakoku it was illegal to leave Japan and the remaining two survivors were jailed and interrogated. One committed suicide and the remaining survivor Hirahara Zenmatsu eventually made it home November 29, 1807 but was summoned by Asano Narikata, The Daimy≈ç of Hiroshima, to recount his odyssey of an experience titled Iban Hyoryu Kikokuroku Zenmatsu. Hirahara Zenmatsu died six months later. Gannenmono In 1866, Eugene Miller Van Reed, a Dutch American, went to Japan as a representative of the Hawaiian Kingdom. He failed to establish a formal Hawaii-Japan relationship, but continued to stay there as a merchant and obtained a permission of Japanese emigration from the Edo Shogunate. As he started recruiting, the new Meiji Government that came into power in 1867, the first year of the Meiji period, nullified all the Edo Shogunate's treaties. (One of the reasons of the new government's rejection is said to be the rumor that Van Reed was engaged in slave trade. For example, Korekiyo Takahashi, whose study in the U.S. was arranged by Van Reed, ended up being sold by the host family as a slave,Takahashi Korekiyo Memorial Park in Yokohama\\"Gannenmono\\" in the October‚ÄìNovember, 2018, issue of Wasabi, published by Japanese Daily Sun of Honolulu but managed to get back to Japan, and eventually became the 20th Prime Minister.) Van Reed, however, proceeded without the new government's permission to send 153 Japanese to Hawaii to work on the sugar plantations. They sailed from Yokohama to Honolulu from May 17 to June 19, 1868, on the Scioto. This first official group of Japanese immigrants were called the Gannenmono (), meaning the \\"people of the first year (of the Meiji period)\\", and the 150th anniversary of their arrival was celebrated in Hawaii in 2018. There were 142 men and 6 women in this initial group, so many of them married Hawaiians after they arrived in Hawaii. They worked on sugar plantations on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and Lanai. Two or three months after arriving, many complained of contract violations since the working conditions and pay did not match with what they were promised. At least four of the six women and 50 men returned to Japan in 1870. Seven had died before their contracts ended. Among the Gannenmono were several people who would become legends among the Japanese Americans in Hawaii: Tomitar≈ç Makino from Miyagi, the leader of the group; the youngest Ichigor≈ç Ishimura, 13 years old; Sentar≈ç Ishii, a samurai from Okayama, who was 102 years old when he died in Maui; Tokujir≈ç \\"Toko\\" Sat≈ç from Tokyo, who lived in Waipio Valley with his Hawaiian wife, Clara; and Tar≈ç And≈ç, who would become Japan's first consul general to the Kingdom of Hawaii.Âú®„Éõ„Éé„É´„É´Êó•Êú¨ÂõΩÁ∑èÈ†ò‰∫ãÈ§®ÂçîË≥õ ‰∏ªÂ©¶„ÇΩ„Çµ„Ç®„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„Éª„Ç™„Éñ„Éª„Éè„ÉØ„Ç§Á∑è‰ºöÈñãÂÇ¨Ôºà‰∏âÊæ§Â∫∑Á∑èÈ†ò‰∫ã„ÅÆ„Çπ„Éî„Éº„ÉÅ„ÄÅ2016Âπ¥Ôºâ (in Japanese) Subsequent immigration Between 1869 and 1885 Japan barred emigration to Hawaii in fear that Japanese laborers would be degrading to the reputation of the Japanese race. In 1881 King David KalƒÅkaua visited Japan to strengthen relations between the two nations. KalƒÅkaua offered not to request extraterritoriality of Japan, an act that departed from the norm of western nations. On March 10 Kalakaua met Meiji to propose a marriage between Princess Victoria Kaiulani and Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito. A few days later the proposal was denied, but the ban on immigration was eventually lifted in 1885.Jan ken po by Dennis M. Ogawa, p. 94 The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on February 8, 1885, as contract laborers for the sugarcane and pineapple plantations.Kuykendall, Ralph S. (1967): The Hawaiian Kingdom: Volume 3 - The Kalakaua Dynasty, 1874-1893, University of Hawaii Press, pp. 164-165, . Many more Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii in the following years. Most of these migrants came from southern Japan (Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, etc.) due to crop failures in the region.  Okinawan immigration  In 1900, the first group of Okinawan laborers arrived in Hawaii after Japan lifted its emigration ban on Okinawa Prefecture. These laborers were helped by Kyuzo Toyama, who is considered to be the \\"father of Okinawan emigration\\". Kyuzo Toyama himself led the second group of Okinawans, who arrived on 1903. By 1920, nearly 20,000 Okinawans and their descendants lived in Hawaii. Today, Okinawans in Hawaii form a distinct community from the Japanese in Hawaii due to cultural and linguistic differences. Annexation of Hawaii by the United States The political environment shifted with the onset of a new era known as the Hawaiian Revolutions. In 1887 the settlers ended absolute rule by the king by forcing him to accept the Bayonet Constitution and agreeing to constitutional government with a powerful parliament. The new constitution gave voting rights only for Hawaiians, Americans, and Europeans, and thus denied rights for Japanese and other Asians. The Japanese commissioner worked to pressure the Kingdom to restore the rights of Japanese by amending the constitution. In 1893 the Hawaiian Monarchy was overthrown, Tokyo responded by appointing Captain T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç to command the Japanese naval activities in Hawaii. The HIJMS Naniwa was sent immediately to Hawaii to rendezvous with the HIJMS Kong≈ç which had been on a training mission. Captain T≈çg≈ç had previously been a guest of KalƒÅkaua, and returned to Hawaii to denounce the overthrow of Queen Lydia Lili ªuokalani, sister and successor to the late king and conduct ‚Äúgunboat diplomacy‚Äù. T≈çg≈ç refused to salute the Provisional Government by not flying the flag of the Republic. He refused to recognize the new regime, encouraged the British ship to do the same and protested the overthrow. The Japanese commissioner eventually stopped T≈çg≈ç from continuing his protest, believing it would undo his work at restoring rights to Japanese. Kat≈ç Kanji wrote in hindsight that he had regretted they had not protested harder and should have recruited the British in the protest. The continued presence of the Japanese Navy and Japan's opposition to the overthrow led to a concern that Japan might use military force to restore Lili ªuokalani to her throne as a Japanese puppet. Anti-Japanese sentiment heightened. After April 30, 1900, all children born in Hawaii were American citizens at birth. () Most of the Japanese children had dual citizenship after their parents registered them. The Japanese settlers set up the first Japanese schools in the United States. By 1920, 98% of all Japanese children in Hawaii attended Japanese schools. Statistics for 1934 showed 183 schools taught a total of 41,192 students.Harada 1934: 43M. Takagi 1987: 18Asato 2005 Today, Japanese schools in Hawaii operate as supplementary education (usually on Friday nights or Saturday mornings) which is on top of the compulsory education required by the state. Today, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities. It is taught in private Japanese-language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese subtexts are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese-language newspapers and magazines; however, these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the local (Hawaii-born) Japanese population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the U.S., many Nisei and Sansei intentionally avoided learning Japanese.Morimoto, (1997) Notable people * Sanji Abe * Bernard Akana * Earl I.

At the age of 11, he left for Berdichev (Berdychiv, Ukraine), where he trained as a meshoyrer (choir singer) in the renowned synagogue choir of cantor Nisan Belzer. In 1881, he emigrated with his family to the United States, and just a year later, while still a teenager, he was largely responsible for the first performance of Yiddish theatre in New York City, in what was to become the Yiddish Theater District. He has been credited as the pioneer of Borscht Belt entertainment. Although Thomashefsky left Imperial Russia at a time when Yiddish theater was still thriving there (it was banned in September 1883), he had never actually seen it performed prior to the 1882 performance he brought together in New York. Thomashefsky, who was earning some money by singing on Saturdays at the Henry Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, was also working as a cigarette maker in a sweatshop, where he first heard songs from the Yiddish theater, sung by some of his fellow workers.\\"Boris Thomashefsky\\". Jewish Virtual Librtary. www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org. Retrieved 2016-12-26. He managed to convince a local tavern owner to invest in bringing over some performers. The first performance was Abraham Goldfaden's Yiddish operetta ◊ì◊ô ◊û◊õ◊©◊§◊î (The Witch). The performance was a bit of a disaster: pious and prosperous \\"uptown\\" German Jews opposed to Yiddish theater did a great deal to sabotage it. Thomashefsky's performing career was launched partly because part of the sabotage consisted of bribing the soubrette to fake a sore throat: Thomashefsky went on in her place. Shortly after, the teenaged Thomashefsky was the pioneer of taking Yiddish theater \\"on the road\\" in the United States, performing Goldfaden's plays in cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Boston and Chicago, all in the 1880s; for much of the 1880s, Chicago was his base. After Yiddish theater was banned in Russia, his tours came to include such prominent actors as Siegmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, and Jacob Adler, with new plays by playwrights such as Moses Ha-Levi Horowitz. [Adler, 1999, 312-314] In 1887, playing in Baltimore, he met 14-year-old Bessie Baumfeld-Kaufman, when she came backstage to meet the beautiful young \\"actress\\" she had seen on stage, only to discover that \\"she\\" was Boris. Bessie soon ran away from home to join the company, and eventually took over the ingenue roles, as Boris moved on to romantic male leads. They were married in 1891. In 1891, with Mogulesko, Kessler, and Adler all engaged in starting the Union Theater, Moishe Finkel brought the still relatively unknown Thomashefsky back to New York to star at his National Theater, where Thomashefsky became such an enormous popular success in Moses Halevy Horowitz's operetta David ben Jesse as to force the Union Theater temporarily to abandon its highbrow programming and compete head on. [Adler, 1999, 318 (commentary)] After Adler recruited Jacob Gordin as a playwright and found a way to draw the masses to serious theater with Gordin's The Yiddish King Lear, and then turned to Shakespeare's Othello, Thomashefsky decided to show that he could compete on that ground as well, and responded with the first Yiddish production of Shakespeare's Hamlet, in which, by all reports, he acquitted himself excellently. [Adler, 1999, 329, 330] His production of \\"Hamlet\\" was more than just a direct translation. The story was also tweaked to make it more accessible to a devout European Jewish audience. At the start of the play, young Hamlet has been away at Rabbinical college, and his uncle has seduced the Queen Mother away from King Hamlet, breaking the old man's heart. There are sectarian jokes regarding communication with angels. Claudius spreads a rumor that Prince Hamlet has succumbed to nihilism while away, but his scheme is discovered and the traitor is sent to Siberia in his nephew's stead. The play ends early, with Hamlet ceremonially marrying Ophelia at her funeral then dying of a broken heart. These types of edits were not uncommon in the Yiddish-language theatre scene. Some critics view it as a step away from immigrant assimilation, others as one step further towards common ground between the new residents and their American neighbors. These productions ushered in what is generally seen as the first great age of Yiddish theater, centered in New York and lasting approximately until a new wave of Jewish immigration, in 1905--1908 once again resulted in a vogue for broad comedy, vaudeville and light operettas, which the Thomashefskys embraced wholeheartedly, especially in performing Leon Kobrin's plays about immigrant life. [Adler, 1999, passim, 359 (commentary)] Other notable Thomashefsky productions included Yiddish versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Goethe's Faust and, unlikely as it may seem, Wagner's Parsifal. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, in an adaptation of Hamlet called Der Yeshiva Bokher (The Yeshiva Student), \\"a wicked uncle smears [a] rabbinic candidate‚Äôs reputation by calling him a nihilist and the young man dies of a broken heart.\\" (They don't say whether this was the production that went head to head with the Adler/Kessler Othello.) By 1910, Thomashefsky owned a 12-room home on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, plus a bungalow by the sea, and 20 acres (81,000 m¬≤) in Hunter, New York which included an open-air theater, Thomashefsky's Paradise Gardens. Each of his three sons had an Arabian horse. [Adler, 1999, 359 (commentary)] However, in 1915, Thomashefsky filed for bankruptcy, listing assets of $21,900 and debts of $76,297.65. In 1935, late in his career, Thomashefsky was an actor/singer in Henry Lynn's Yiddish film, Bar Mitzvah,Bridge of Light (Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds), page 191n, J. Hoberman, Museum of Modern Art, Published by Shocken Books, 1991, YIVO translations in which he played a melodramatic role with gusto and co-produced the film. He sang, Erlekh Zayn (Be Virtuous), a song from a 1924 Yiddish play, Bar Mitzvah. With his wife, actress Bessie Thomashefsky, he had three sons, as well a daughter who died when she was six years old. The third son, Theodore, changed his name to Ted Thomas and became a stage manager. One of Ted Thomas's sons is the noted conductor Michael Tilson Thomas. The first son, Harry, went on to direct his father in the films Bar Mitzvah and The Jewish King Lear, and later moved with his mother to Los Angeles. The second son, known as Mickey, had affairs with two women at the same time, which led to a dramatic murder- attempt/suicide in 1931, reminiscent of his Aunt Emma Thomashefsky Finkel's notorious 1904 affair. Both Mickey and his Aunt Emma were left paralyzed by the attempted murders by jealous mates and both later died of complications related to their wounds; Emma, many years later, in 1929, and Mickey, five years after in 1936. Boris Thomashefsky carried on a long-term affair with Yiddish actress Regina Zuckerberg, who modeled herself on Bessie in dress, speech, style and acting‚Äîexcept that she was twenty years younger. This caused a separation between Boris and Bessie, who both went on to successful but separate careers, until Boris became a pauper in the 1930s.The Thomashefskys: Music, Memories and Life in the Theater Both Thomashefskys did much to shape the world of modern theatre from the follies to Broadway and gave a start to many actors, composers and producers who went on to start and own theaters and movie studios. Even the Gershwin brothers had their start with the Thomashefkys. The Thomashefskys were also prominent in addressing controversial social issues of the day and in teaching the Greenhorns how to be Americans. They not only founded theaters and production companies, but had publishing houses and many other successful business adventures. Boris Thomashefsky even founded and funded a Jewish Army which he sent to Israel and was named after him. The unit later became a unit in the British Army. Thomashefsky is buried with his wife, who, though separated from him by 1911, never divorced him, in the Yiddish theater section of the Mount Hebron Cemetery. In the third Marx Brothers movie, Monkey Business, Groucho Marx (in defending his right to hide in a gangster's moll's closet) exclaims, \\"That's what they said to Thomas Edison, mighty inventor, Thomas Lindbergh, mighty flyer, and Thomashefsky, 'mighty like a rose'!\\" Tribute was also paid in Mel Brooks' 1968 film The Producers when Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) attributes his acumen as a Broadway producer to the tutelage of \\"the great Boris Thomashefsky\\"; the line is also present in the stage musical and film musical versions, in the song \\"The King of Broadway\\". In 2011 Shuler Hensley portrayed Boris Thomashefsky in The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater, a concert stage show celebrating the Thomashefskys and the music of American Yiddish theatre hosted by their grandson the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas. The show aired on the PBS series Great Performances in 2012.

He was particularly prominent as a madrigalist, one of the few among the Venetians other than Monteverdi and Andrea Gabrieli.  Life  He was born in Chioggia, a fishing town on the Adriatic coast south of Venice, the same town as Gioseffo Zarlino, and he came to Venice early, becoming a member of the boy's choir at St. Mark's under Zarlino's direction by the time he was eight years old. Zarlino evidently found him in a choir in Chioggia Cathedral, and recruited him for St. Mark's.Arnold, p. 35 Croce may have been a parish priest at the church of Santa Maria Formosa, and he took holy orders in 1585; during this period he also served as a singer at St. Mark's. He evidently maintained some connection, probably as a director of music, with Santa Maria Formosa alongside his duties at St. Mark's. After the death of Zarlino, he became assistant maestro di cappella; this was during the tenure of Baldassare Donato. When Donato died in 1603 Croce took over the principal job as maestro di cappella but the singing standards of the famous St. Mark's cathedral declined under his direction, most likely due more to his declining health than his lack of musicianship. He died in 1609; the position of maestro di cappella went to Giulio Cesare Martinengo until 1613, at which time Monteverdi took the job.  Music and influence  Croce wrote less music in the grand polychoral style than Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, although he left a grand mass for four choirs, composed for Ferdinand of Austria (the future Emperor Ferdinand II) and several triple-choir Psalm settings (only one of which has survived), and as a result his music has not maintained the same fame to the present day; however he was renowned as a composer at the time, and had a large influence on music both in Italy and abroad. As a composer of sacred music he was mostly conservative, writing cori spezzati in the manner of Adrian Willaert, and parody masses more like the music composed by the members of the contemporary Roman School. However, later in his career he wrote some music in a forward-looking concertato style, which attempted to combine the innovations of Viadana with the grand Venetian polychoral manner. This posthumous collection, the Sacre Cantilene Concertate of 1610, is for 3, 5 or 6 solo voices, continuo and a 4-voice Ripieno which can be multiplied ad lib (presumably in different parts of the church). Most of Croce's sacred music is for double-choir: this includes three masses, two books of motets, and sets of music for Terce, Lauds and Vespers. Although most of his sacred music was written for the professional singers of St Mark's (including several pieces written for their participation in a freelance company of musicians under Croce's direction, who performed for the Scuole Grande of Venice) much of his music is technically simple: for that reason much of it, especially the secular music, has remained popular with amateurs. One collection, the motets for 4 voices of 1597, is clearly designed for less ambitious church choirs. Croce is also credited with the first published continuo parts, many of his double-choir collections being issued either with a 'Basso per sonare nell'organo' or a 'Partidura' (or Spartidura) which indicated both choirs. Stylistically, Croce was more influenced by Andrea Gabrieli than his nephew Giovanni, even though they were exact contemporaries; Croce preferred the emotional coolness, the Palestrinian clarity and the generally lighter character of Andrea's music. Croce was particularly important in the development of the canzonetta and the madrigal comedy, and wrote a large quantity of easily singable, popular, and often hilarious music. Some of his collections are satirical, for example setting to music ridiculous scenes at Venetian carnivals (Mascarate piacevoli et ridicolose per il carnevale, 1590), some of which are in dialect. Croce was one of the first composers to use the term capriccio, as a title for one of the canzonettas in his collection Triaca musicale (musical cure for animal bites) of 1595. Both this and the Mascarate piacevoli collections were intended to be sung in costumes and masks at Venetian carnivals. His canzonettas and madrigals were influential in the Netherlands and in England, where they were reprinted in the second book of Musica transalpina (1597), one of the collections which inaugurated the mania for madrigal composition there. Croce's music remained popular in England and Thomas Morley specifically singled him out as a master composer; indeed Croce may have been the biggest single influence on Morley. John Dowland visited him in Italy as well.  Media  References and further reading  * Articles \\"Giovanni Croce, Canzonetta\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Band history McCaughey formed the band in 1993 as a side project with Buck, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow of The Posies. Buck had moved to the Seattle area in 1992; the other principals were longtime fixtures of the Seattle music scene. The four musicians had numerous personal and professional connections: both the Posies and McCaughey's The Young Fresh Fellows had recorded at Conrad Uno's Egg Studios and released albums on Uno's PopLlama Records label. The Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies were fixtures of Seattle's Crocodile Cafe, owned and managed by Buck's then-girlfriend (later wife) Stephanie Dorgan. The Young Fresh Fellows were the opening band at a Kevn Kinney gig at the Croc On July 4, 1992; Buck backed Kinney along with R.E.M.'s Mike Mills and Bill Berry. The band's name is a nod to classic-rock quintets such as The Count Five, MC5 and The Dave Clark Five and part of a trend of intentionally-misnamed groups such as Ben Folds Five and Pizzicato Five which had fewer than five members. The use of a negative number in the band name is typical of the self-deprecating humor pervasive in the then grunge-saturated Seattle music scene. The song titles of the group's earliest output‚Äîamong them, \\"Loser So Supreme,\\" \\"Drunkard's Lullaby,\\" and \\"Brotherhood Of Pain\\"‚Äîare indicative of the downbeat nature of the band's initial output. Themes of alcoholism, death, and self-hatred are recurrent in each subsequent Minus 5 release. \\"McCaughey realized he had a dumptruck-load of songs that the Young Fresh Fellows would either never get around to, or would wisely choose not to,\\" read one press release. \\"[Buck, Stringfellow and Auer] were quick to volunteer to help Scott capture his 'Let The Bad Times Roll' vision.\\"  Hello Recording Club EP  The band assembled at Uno's Egg Studio in summer 1993 and recorded their debut EP for the Hello CD of the Month Club, a subscription-only mail order club run by John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants. For this EP the band were supplemented by NRBQ members Tom Ardolino and Terry Adams and Young Fresh Fellows bassist Jim Sangster. McCaughey's darkly humorous lyrics and minor key compositions meshed seamlessly with Buck's bright guitar hooks. The band's aesthetic is defined by opener \\"Loser So Supreme,\\" which pairs the chiming mandolin licks Buck popularized on \\"Losing My Religion\\" with downbeat observations like \\"No one can reveal what has always been revealed/No one can invent a world that already exists.\\" Auer and Stringfellow, known more for their power-pop inflected vocal harmonies and guitar solos, added cacophonous textures on piano, keyboards and guitar. For this release only the band's name was stylized as 'The Minus Five'; all subsequent releases have used a numeral. The EP was sent to subscribers as the December 1993/January 1994 release.  Live debut and 1994 recording sessions  The Minus 5 made their live debut at the Crocodile Cafe on November 9, 1993 on a bill supporting jangly indie heroes The Silos. As Auer and Stringfellow were in Europe touring behind the Posies' Frosting On The Beater, the Minus 5 performed as a duo with backing from The Silos' Walter Salas- Humara, Tom Freund and Manuel Versoza for the last three songs. The set included lively covers of Johnny Cash's \\"I Still Miss Someone\\" and Neil Young's \\"Barstool Blues\\" as well as four freshly-written McCaughey compositions. At the time, it was widely assumed that the Minus 5 was a one- off proposition that might not record again, and certainly never tour due to the primary obligations of the principal musicians. However, McCaughey continued to record at various Seattle studios including Egg, Down In The Hole and Private Radio throughout 1994. NRBQ's Ardolino and Adams contributed to two more cuts; The Walkabouts' Carla Torgerson and Chris Eckman added cello and guitar; legendary Seattle street performer Richard Peterson played various horns. McCaughey also recorded Young Fresh Fellows' Temptation On A Saturday EP during this period using some of the same musicians. Due to recording duties on R.E.M.'s Monster, Buck was away from Seattle for much of 1994, returning only briefly for the birth of his twin daughters. When mixing on R.E.M.'s album was complete, Buck turned his attention to McCaughey's new songs. The Minus 5 played their second show at the Crocodile Cafe on September 15, 1994, just a week before Monster's release. For this gig McCaughey, Buck and Stringfellow were joined by The Model Rockets' John Ramberg. By fall 1994, McCaughey was caught up in the promotional blitz behind Monster, making his live debut with R.E.M. on Saturday Night Live November 12, 1994. McCaughey was subsequently recruited to join R.E.M. on their worldwide tour which kicked off in January 1995. The Minus 5's cover of Johnny Cash's \\"I Still Miss Someone\\" was released on a 1994 German compilation titled Love Is My Only Crime ‚Äì Part Two. The CD also featured rare or previously unreleased songs from The Young Fresh Fellows and future McCaughey collaborator Steve Wynn.  Old Liquidator  In April 1995, R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm, causing more than two months of planned tour dates to be abruptly cancelled. In the unexpected downtime, McCaughey and Buck put the finishing touches on what would become the Minus 5's debut LP‚Äîat the time titled Last Call, Corporal. The finished product, hastily retitled Old Liquidator, was at first a hard-to-find, low-key release on German indie label Glitterhouse. Though pressed in modest numbers and at first only available in the U.S. as an import, the cache of being an 'R.E.M. side project' in 1995 was an irresistible lure to thirsty collectors. It wasn't long before Minneapolis distributor East Side Digital released the album in the U.S. as well. Old Liquidator is haunted by the unexpected Christmas 1994 death of McCaughey's friend Jimmy Silva, who had collaborated with Young Fresh Fellows, Stringfellow, Uno and members of The Smithereens. \\"Worse,\\" the second track on the album, was co-written with Silva. Other cuts such as \\"Story\\" are influenced by the surrealist imagery of mid-60s Bob Dylan, invoking fictional misadventures of figures including Franz Kafka. Another inspiration is Nick Lowe, whose obscure 1979 B-side \\"Basing Street\\" is smothered here in the squealing distortion Buck patented on \\"Country Feedback.\\" Elsewhere, Buck's exotic bouzouki and dulcimer textures proved welcome departures from Monster's fuzzed-out glam riffs. The Byrds-influenced Rickenbacker jangle of single \\"Emperor Of The Bathroom\\" is unmistakably Buck. Auer and Stringfellow are more tangible on this album, harmonizing amiably on opener \\"Winter Goes Away\\" and closing singalong \\"When It Comes My Way.\\" Old Liquidator begins The Minus 5's custom of numbering their releases, including singles, in chronological order. On the back cover, the subtitle \\"The Minus 5 No. 2 Record\\" is prominently displayed above the musicians' names. A CD single for \\"The Emperor Of The Bathroom\\" was released in fall 1995 with alternate versions of three album cuts, a country-fried outtake called \\"Heartache For Sale\\" and a cover of the Fantastic Baggys' \\"This Little Woody.\\" When the Monster tour resumed in summer 1995, R.E.M. began recording what would later become the New Adventures In Hi- Fi album using recordings of new songs made in concert, at soundchecks, in dressing rooms and even on the tour bus. McCaughey, again called along for the ride, contributed significantly to these recordings playing piano, organ, synths and autoharp. Between R.E.M. gigs on June 1, 1995, The Minus 5 played their first show outside of Seattle at the Lounge Ax in Chicago. Without Auer and Stringfellow, Buck and McCaughey were supported by Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy, R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills, and Mark Greenberg. New songs \\"Moonshine Girl\\" and \\"Wouldn't Want To Care\\" were debuted alongside Johnny Cash, Nick Lowe, Gram Parsons and Porter Wagoner covers. During another tour hiatus, The Minus 5 played gigs at the Tractor Tavern and Crocodile Cafe in Seattle at the end of August 1995. New song \\"Bullfight\\" was debuted at these shows, which featured Young Fresh Fellows and Fastbacks guitarist Kurt Bloch in addition to McCaughey, Buck and Auer. In December 1995, The Minus 5 played two nights at the Crocodile Cafe in support of Kevn Kinney, supplemented by Screaming Trees' Barrett Martin on upright bass. The Minus 5 and Kevn Kinney also played at the Aladdin Theater in Portland as The Barrett Martin Quartet.  Hollywood Records deal and The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy  The modest success of Old Liquidator and continued cultural cache of R.E.M. brought The Minus 5 a great deal of attention in 1996. Not only were the group signed to Disney- affiliated Hollywood Records, but the label agreed to finance a follow-up record and even reissue some of McCaughey's back catalog. Moreover, McCaughey was given his own label imprint, Malt Records, with distribution through Hollywood. Though the bulk of recording for New Adventures In Hi-Fi had taken place on the road, Buck was occupied through early 1996 with recording and mixing the new R.E.M. album. Nonetheless, McCaughey and Buck continued to record in piecemeal sessions with Avast! engineer Kevin Suggs, Conrad Uno, John Keane, and Water Music's Rob Grenoble. In late summer, The Minus 5 played KISW's Pain In The Grass concert in support of The Posies, who were busy touring behind their 1996 release Amazing Disgrace. New songs \\"Cross Every Line\\" and \\"Empty Room\\" were premiered by a lineup including McCaughey, Buck, Auer, Stringfellow and John Ramberg. New Adventures In Hi-Fi was released September 10, 1996. With no tour planned to promote the album, Buck was free to explore other musical pursuits. In early fall 1996, Buck embarked on two new musical collaborations: the instrumental supergroup Tuatara with Barrett Martin, and a collaborative album with American Music Club's Mark Eitzel. Martin joined the Minus 5 for a Crocodile Cafe gig on October 7, 1996 where new songs \\"Hate Me More\\" and \\"Dear Employer (The Reason I Quit\\") were debuted. McCaughey's then-wife Christy McWilson also joined the group for this show. The following week, Tuatara made their live debut at the Croc. In December 1996, Buck booked a week with engineer Ed Brooks at Ironwood in Seattle to record Eitzel's West album. McCaughey, Martin, and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready were all on hand for the sessions. At the end of the sessions, The Minus 5 opened for Eitzel at the Crocodile Cafe. Martin and Eitzel both joined The Minus 5 for several songs and McCaughey premiered new song \\"Boeing Spacearium.\\" The second Minus 5 full-length, dubbed The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy, was completed at Ironwood shortly thereafter. The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy, cobbled together from McCaughey's many 1996 sessions, featured an impressive roster of guests including Guided by Voices' Robert Pollard, The Presidents of the United States of America, McWilson, Barrett Martin and Mike McCready. Unlike previous releases, each song was credited equally to McCaughey and Buck. In the liner notes each player was assigned a \\"role\\" as in a rock opera, with McCaughey himself playing \\"Buck McCoy\\" and others assuming roles like \\"Admiral Boot,\\" \\"The Constable\\" and \\"Ancient Roomer.\\" In reference to the creative process of the album, the liner notes provide a synopsis: \\"Little Buck McCoy wakes up born in the middle of a wheatfield. He decides to carry on alone, despite his many acquaintances, until dying years later.\\" The songs did not actually constitute a narrative or refer to these characters at all. Critics took note of the haphazard nature of the proceedings, which included Small Faces pastiche \\"Popsycle Shoppe\\" and a cover of John Lennon's harrowing \\"My Mummy's Dead.\\" No Depression called the album \\"Surprisingly bitter froth...Most of the record's 12 songs quake with the severely compressed intimacy and hazy chamber-ballad tension of recent R.E.M. (no surprise) and John Lennon.\\" Hollywood Records did not release a single to promote the album.  The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States tour  In early 1997, R.E.M. began the process of writing demos for a new album both in Athens in February and Buck's Hawaiian residence in April. The three albums Buck had contributed to in 1996 were all released within weeks of one another. Tuatara's Breaking The Ethers was released March 1, 1997, followed by Eitzel's West and The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy on the same day: May 5, 1997. A U.S. tour was assembled that would allow Buck to tour both coasts with all three acts, under the title The Magnificent Seven vs. The United States. The Magnificent Seven referred to McCaughey, Stringfellow, Eitzel, Martin and the three remaining members of Tuatara‚Äîthough counting Buck there were actually eight. American Music Club bassist Dan Pearson later joined the tour to augment Eitzel's sets. For this tour The Minus 5 consisted of Buck, McCaughey, Stringfellow, Martin, and Tuatara's Justin Harwood. The tour kicked off May 1, 1997 with two hometown gigs at the Crocodile. Each show featured Tuatara and Eitzel performing two sets each, with a short Minus 5 set between and occasionally McCaughey performing solo. The 22-date tour continued for two months, with many media appearances along the way. Buck and Eitzel performed on KFOG in San Francisco, Late Night With Conan O'Brien and then on WBCN radio in Boston. All three groups played Morning Becomes Eclectic on KCRW in Santa Monica and Idiot's Delight on WNEW in New York. Near the end of the tour all three groups played a free in-store at New York record mecca Other Music. The East Coast leg of the tour was peppered with surprise guests: Pearl Jam's Mike McCready and John Wesley Harding showed up in New York, Mike Mills joined The Minus 5 in Philadelphia and Atlanta, and Michael Stipe joined his R.E.M. bandmates for a four-song encore in Atlanta. Reaction to the tour was mixed. None of the three records sold particularly well, and the critics' approval was tepid: \\"A three-hour marathon that was simply too much to absorb,\\" Sara Scribner wrote in the Los Angeles Times. \\"The Minus 5, despite some catchy, jangling tunes from its new album...never got its footing.\\" Geoffrey Himes wrote in The Washington Post: \\"Genuinely amusing when the tunes were bouncy and catchy, but the slow numbers didn't have the humor or melody to justify the dreary pacing.\\" In June 1997, Buck recorded some tracks with Robyn Hitchcock for his album Jewels For Sophia in Seattle. After the session, McCaughey joined Hitchcock and Buck for a Crocodile Cafe gig under the name \\"Popscyle Shoppe Incident: Viva Sea Tac II.\\" Tim Keegan and Kurt Bloch joined in the set, and Young Fresh Fellows were the opening act.  Hollywood Records deluxe reissues  In August 1997, Hollywood Records reissued Old Liquidator and, curiously, McCaughey's 1989 solo album My Chartreuse Opinion in deluxe editions with bonus tracks. My Chartreuse Opinion, a Conrad Uno- recorded affair which featured cameos from Jimmy Silva and Christy McWilson, was now credited to \\"The Minus 5 of Scott McCaughey.\\" The reissue actually featured fewer bonus tracks than the now out-of-print original release, which featured four unrelated Silva recordings at the end. Nonetheless, it was a great way of drawing attention to McCaughey's back catalog and much easier to find than the initial release. Old Liquidator was also expanded, adding two songs from the Hello Recording Club EP, \\"Heartache For Sale\\" from the \\"Emperor of the Bathroom\\" single, and two short instrumentals. These would prove to be The Minus 5's final releases on Hollywood. Just weeks before the release of The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy, longtime Hollywood Records president Bob Pfeifer resigned. Under a reorganization plan, Disney acquired established indie Mammoth Records for $25 million in an attempt to diversify its roster. Mammoth founder Jay Faires was now charged with breaking The Minus 5 to a larger audience, but industry watchers such as Variety's Adam Sandler questioned why Disney didn't focus on \\"pop music, which is a better fit with its TV and film programming, rather than indie-inspired repertoire.\\"  McCaughey joins R.E.M. and Tuatara in the studio  While R.E.M. was in Georgia recording demos for what would become Up, The Minus 5 played its first two shows without Buck: at Chicago's Lounge Ax on August 16, 1997 the band consisted of McCaughey, Stringfellow, Jason Finn and Dharma Bums' Jim Talstra. The raucous gig was by far the band's longest to date: an 11-song McCaughey solo set followed by a 22-song Minus 5 powerhouse that included unreleased songs, several nuggets from My Chartreuse Opinion and covers of John Lennon and The Modern Lovers. The following week, McCaughey played a gig with John Wesley Harding at the Croc in Seattle which included a handful of Minus 5 tunes and as-yet-unreleased Young Fresh Fellows songs. In October 1997, Bill Berry announced he was leaving R.E.M. Having completed more than eight months of writing and recording demos for Up, R.E.M. made the decision to continue as a three-piece. As the recording process continued in 1998, McCaughey became an important contributor in the studio, usually on keyboards. Ken Stringfellow and Barrett Martin were also recruited for some of these sessions. McCaughey was also roped into Tuatara in 1998, contributing three tracks to sophomore album Trading With The Enemy. Near the end of 1997, The Minus 5 played the two-night Crocodile Cafe's An Evenings In Edenbrook Forest event, with a lineup that included McCaughey, Buck, Martin and John Ramberg. A special double CD compilation was given away at the shows which included The Minus 5's cover of The Modern Lovers' \\"Government Center\\" and rare or unreleased cuts from Young Fresh Fellows, The Lowe Beats (McCaughey's Nick Lowe cover band), The Model Rockets, Fastbacks and others. The CD was the inaugural release of Book Records, a new label McCaughey started for extremely limited or tour-only releases. In 1999, the group accepted an invitation to participate in a tribute album to Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill with cancer, for the purpose of raising funds to assist with medical expenses.See More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album. Since McCaughey had made The Minus 5 his primary musical outlet, new material from The Young Fresh Fellows had slowed to a trickle. In 1994 and 1995 the group had released three singles and an EP. Nonetheless, McCaughey often recorded new songs with the Fellows and by summer 1999, had enough to release as an album. A Tribute To Music was released on Spanish indie label Rock and Roll Inc. and never released in the U.S. Though most of the tracks were originals, the Fellows made an unremarkable pass at R.E.M.'s rocker \\"Circus Envy\\" on the LP. Considered a minor release by both fans and critics, A Tribute To Music left many wondering if McCaughey was saving his best tunes for his other band. \\"There's a tossed-off feeling to the record,\\" Bart Bealmear wrote for AllMusic. \\"[Most of the songs] are missing the group's unique mix of humor, energy, spirit, and melody.\\"  In Rock  On January 9, 2000 The Minus 5 played a secret show at Lounge Ax in Chicago, opening for Wilco (billed as \\"Summer Teeth\\") for 300 lucky fans. This was a farewell gig as the beloved Lincoln Park venue would shut its doors just one week later. For this gig the Minus 5 was just McCaughey fronting Wilco, with frontman Jeff Tweedy playing bass. The group raced through a handful of brand-new, unrehearsed songs alongside covers of influences as diverse as Mott The Hoople, Johnny Cash and Neutral Milk Hotel. A few weeks later (January 20) a more conventional Minus 5 lineup (McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Chris Ballew and R.E.M. session drummer Bill Rieflin) premiered eight of these new songs at the Crocodile Cafe back in Seattle. John Wesley Harding and Kurt Block sat in on a few numbers. In early February McCaughey and Stringfellow joined R.E.M. in Georgia to record instrumental demos for the Reveal album. On February 25, McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg and Rieflin played another Minus 5 gig at the Crocodile, premiering new tracks \\"Over The Sea\\" and \\"Beyond The Sea\\" alongside more recent compositions. On March 13, 2000 McCaughey assembled a skeleton crew of himself, Buck, Ramberg and R.E.M. session drummer Bill Rieflin at Jupiter Studios in Seattle and recorded ten of his latest compositions in one day. The session included spirited takes on the Nightcrawlers' power-pop anthem \\"The Little Black Egg\\", an ode to the demise of the Lounge Ax (\\"The Night Chicago Died (The Death of The Minus 5)\\") and even a tribute to Dr. Evil, the villain in the Austin Powers film series. On April 25, 2000 The Minus 5 played another Croc show with a lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Barrett Martin. John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson and The Long Winters' John Roderick sat in on the set, which included Bee Gees, Wings and Rolling Stones covers. The Minus 5 returned to the Croc on June 8 with McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, Rieflin and John Wesley Harding playing a set which included some improvised one-off songs, Faces and Paul McCartney covers. Despite a rigorous recording schedule for R.E.M. with sessions in Georgia and Dublin, Ireland, Buck was nonetheless available for Minus 5 gigs on July 7 at Tractor Tavern at September 2 at Bumbershoot Festival at Memorial Stadium. The Minus 5 were a last-minute replacement for a band that dropped out of the fest and for this show consisted of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, John Wesley Harding, Robert Lloyd (of Harding's band) and members of the Walkabouts. McCaughey pressed 1,000 copies of the March session as a surprise album, titled In Rock. Because it was made as a limited-edition, tour-only CD McCaughey released it on his Book label. The CD was only available at Minus 5 shows at first, though it was later sold through the R.E.M. fanclub. The CD was sold for the first time at an October 14, 2000 Crocodile Cafe show with McCaughey, Buck, Stringfellow, Ramberg and Rieflin. A Sonics cover band (The New Original Sonic Sound) featuring members of Mudhoney, Tuatara, and Gas Huffer with McCaughey on keyboards also played. In October 2000 McCaughey and Stringfellow returned to Georgia to record with R.E.M. During the sessions, McCaughey, Stringfellow and Mike Mills joined local group The Possibilities for a loose set that included Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Chris Bell, Joni Mitchell and Gram Parsons covers. The Minus 5's cover of the band's \\"You Don't Mean It\\" would be released as a radio single just a few months later. The Minus 5 closed out an eventful year with a Croc set on December 8, 2000 with the lineup of McCaughey, Buck, Ramberg, and Rieflin with guests John Wesley Harding, Sean Nelson, Britt Speakman, Carla Tongerson and Peter Blackstock. A number of new songs were debuted at this show including \\"A Thousand Years Away\\" and \\"You Don't Mean It.\\"  Let the War Against Music Begin  In 2001, the Minus Five and the Young Fresh Fellows, another McCaughey project, released a split double album, Let the War Against Music Begin/Because We Hate You; the \\"Let the War Against Music Begin\\" half was the Minus 5 submission. After a change of guard at Hollywood Records, the Minus 5 found themselves releasing music via independent channels, with the Return to Sender label releasing a collection of outtakes from Let the War Against Music Begin called I Don't Know Who I Am before McCaughey signed the band to the Yep Roc label for his collaboration with Wilco, Down With Wilco. Yep Roc later issued an EP dominated by Down With Wilco outtakes, At the Organ, and reissued In Rock, a collection of tunes McCaughey recorded in a single day in 2000. In 2002, the band contributed a track, \\"Girl I Never Met\\" to Rami Jaffee, Pete Yorn, and Marc Dauer's Trampoline Records release: Trampoline Records Volume I. The band's seventh album, self-titled (but known as The Gun Album), was released early 2006, and features, along the regular line-up, guest appearances by Wilco, Kelly Hogan and The Decemberists' singer/songwriter Colin Meloy, among others. Buck and McCaughey went on to play in The Baseball Project together in 2008. Buck and McCaughey playing with The Baseball Project/The Minus 5/Steve Wynn IV in 2009 The Minus 5 appeared on John Wesley Harding's 2009 release, Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead and released Killingsworth later that year. In 2012 recorded a version of the 1976 hit single by the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver \\"Arms of Mary\\" for a fund raising CD titled \\"Super Hits Of The Seventies\\" for radio station WFMU. The band played at SXSW in 2013. In January 2017 The Minus 5 joined Alejandro Escovedo for a short tour. For each concert Scott McCaughey, Kurt Bloch, Peter Buck, and John Moen played one set as the Minus Five, and then a second set backing Escovedo, sometimes with Kelly Hogan, too. All of them had also performed on Escovedo's 2016 album Burn Something Beautiful, for which Escovedo, McCaughey, and Buck co-wrote the songs.

It provides assistance to disaster-affected regions for up to 40 days. DART's headquarters is located in Kingston, Ontario. DART was created by the Canadian government in 1996 in the aftermath of the inadequate response to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, when Canada's aid arrived after the peak of a cholera epidemic. The government determined that it would be of the utmost importance in many disasters if it was able to rapidly deploy a group of people until long-term aid arrived. DART has an annual budget of , although during specific incidents the Parliament of Canada can choose to temporarily allocate millions of dollars to DART to fund their response effort. For example, Operation Torrent, the aid mission to Turkey in the wake of the 1999 earthquake which left 17,000 people dead, saw used by DART in the response. Goals DART has four goals: #To provide basic medical care: To serve, with its medical platoon of 40 staff, up to 250 outpatients and 10 inpatients per day. Although the medical station will not perform surgery, it treats minor injuries and attempts to prevent the spread of disease. The aid station includes a laboratory, a pharmacy, limited obstetrics services and rehydration and a preventative medicine section. #To produce safe drinking water: Water purification staff can produce up to 60,000 liters of drinking water a day, as well as chlorinating local wells and monitoring water supplies. #To repair basic infrastructure: Engineers can fix roads and bridges, repair electrical and water supply systems and build refugee camps. #To make communications easier: DART sets up facilities to make communications easier between everyone involved in the relief effort, including the afflicted country, non- governmental organizations and UN aid agencies. Missions The Canadian government decides whether or not to send DART after a request from a country or the United Nations. Typically, upon a request from the government of the affected country, the Canadian government will dispatch its four to seven- person Canadian Disaster Assessment Team (CDAT). The CDAT members are from Global Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence (DND). For all humanitarian assistance/DART missions Global Affairs Canada is the lead department representing the Government of Canada. The CDAT will assess the situation and submit its recommendations back to the Government (of Canada), who will decide if the DART can or cannot be of assistance. If it agrees to provide assistance, it will dispatch an additional group of 12-19 personnel who form the Humanitarian Assistance Reconnaissance Team (HART) who will make preparations to receive the remainder of the team into the affected area. Critiques Although DART's goals may be well-intended there have been critiques of this program. It is costly, which comes with the nature of military intervention. Furthermore, although it does align with Canada's foreign policy of the three Ds (defence, diplomacy, and development) it does not help with the global health inequity. Operation Central (Honduras), 1998 In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch, a category-5 hurricane, struck Central America over a period of three days. As a result, 6,000 people died and over a million were missing or made homeless. DART situated themselves in the middle of the Rio Aguan Valley, in north-central Honduras. Because there were many isolated communities that were connected only by then-broken roads and bridges, DART was supported by four CH-146 Griffon helicopters from Canadian Forces Base Petawawa. By the end of the mission in mid-December 1998, DART had delivered 250,000 pounds of food and medical supplies throughout the valley. They also produced thousands of litres of clean drinking water and chlorinated local wells supporting approximately 15,000 people. Working with the medical personnel in Honduras, DART treated about 7,500 patients for ailments such as respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, skin infections, diarrhoea, parasitic infections and intestinal infections. It also helped repair roads, bridges and electrical systems. Operation Torrent (Turkey), 1999 DART responded to a 7.4-magnitude earthquake that hit north-western Turkey on August 17, 1999. DART was deployed on the following day and set up a camp in Serdivan, a suburb of Adapazarƒ±, which had 180,000 people. During this mission, DART personnel assisted in cleaning up a school, restoring electricity and designing and constructing a tented camp which could hold 2,500 people. This camp also had washroom and shower facilities. DART treated 5,000 patients and produced 2.5 million litres of bulk water. Operation Structure (Sri Lanka), 2004 DART responded to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that occurred on December 26, 2004. The reconnaissance team left for Colombo, Sri Lanka on December 30, 2004. A commercial plane carried a reconnaissance crew with representatives from Foreign Affairs Canada (three), Canadian International Development Agency (two), Public Health Agency (one), and DART itself (six). Prime Minister Paul Martin announced his plans to send DART into the region on January 2, 2005. Four days later, a plane carrying 150 DART members departed for Ampara, Sri Lanka. On January 8, 2005, 50 more members arrived. Sri Lanka suffered tremendously as a result of the earthquake, the Canadian government stated that their relief efforts were to be concentrated there. They set up their main camp in a former sugar factory. Ampara is cited as being one of the most affected by the tsunami. The Canadian government estimates that 105,560 out of the 600,000 people living in the city had been forced to seek temporary shelter. An estimated 10,400 deaths occurred as a result of the earthquake. The DART team brought four water purification units, which can provide up to 200,000 litres of clean water per day. It also provided primary medical care, some special engineering capabilities, and communications between DART, Sri Lanka and other relief organizations. The mission was expected to last six weeks. Their first task was to supply hospitals with potable water, (which they hoped to achieve by using their water purification units, which can purify 150,000 to 200,000 litres per day). Thus far, DART has treated 5,800 patients and produced more than 2.5 million litres of purified water. They have also helped repair schools, clear rubble, build temporary shelters and repair fishing boats and water mains in Sri Lanka. The lack of an immediate response by what was supposed to be a rapid- response unit aroused significant criticism. Although the DART team was ready to leave within 24 hours of when the disaster struck, the government took two days to announce that the team would be dispatched, and it took nearly two weeks for DART to actually leave for Sri Lanka, due to a lack of available air transport. These delays notwithstanding, the DART chief, Michael Voith, commended DART's work, saying: \\"What I can tell you after this mission is the organization of the DART that we have right now ... is a sound organization, it brings an incredible capability to a disaster area\\". John Watson of CARE Canada, responded by calling the operation an \\"amateur\\" response. Voith dismissed these remarks, saying that the team filled a \\"critical void.\\" DART supporters have also noted that the initial response (i.e. digging people out of collapsed buildings, providing surgery/immediate serious trauma care for the injured), is not a DART responsibility. This is apparent from the fact that they do not have trauma surgeons, SAR assets, firefighters or other professionals who would be of critical importance during the very first days after a disaster. Rather, the job of DART is to mitigate the impact of the lack of critical infrastructure after a disaster. Operation Plateau (Pakistan), 2005 DART responded to the magnitude 7.6 2005 Kashmir earthquake on October 8, 2005. On October 14, three days after a nine-member Canadian delegation left to assess the situation, Prime Minister Paul Martin announced that DART would be going to the Muzaffarabad region of Pakistan. The reconnaissance team arrived on October 16, the main force two days later. By December 9 all DART personnel had returned to Canada. DART distributed 500 tonnes of humanitarian aid supplies and purified and distributed 3,811,535 litres of drinking water.DND/CF  Backgrounder  Operation PLATEAU: The DART deployment in Pakistan The team also provided medical treatment for 11,782 people, including: #7,000 who received care from mobile medical teams airlifted by helicopter to their isolated communities. #2,637 who received care at the DART clinic in Gahri Dupatta. #2,145 who were immunized against a variety of contagious diseases. The value of the operation, as well as its cost-effectiveness, was criticized for its excessive emphasis on technological solutions rather than on broader local primary-care needs - a type of criticism that Canada's emergency response has received as early as its relief operations in 1985 following the Mexico City earthquake and more specifically in regards to the belated deployment of DART in 2004 to the Asia-Pacific tsunami disaster (see Operation Structure (Sri Lanka), 2004). It is suggested that rapidly deploying human resources in order for health to reach victims in the shortest possible time would have been the most efficient and most cost- effective form of response.Jerry M. Spiegel & Robert Huish (2009): Canadian foreign aid for global health: Human security opportunity lost, Canadian Foreign Policy Journal, 15:3, 60-84 Operation Hestia (Haiti), 2010 DART deployed to Haiti to assist in the recovery effort after a massive earthquake hit the country in January 2010. While there, they worked in tandem with 12,000 US MINUSTAH and 2,000 Canadian troops, mainly from 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group). Following an initial assessment and relief work near Port-au-Prince, the DART team began to concentrate their efforts on the area surrounding Jacmel on January 18, 2010. Operation Renaissance 13-01 (Philippines) 2013 On November 11, 2013, DART sent 43 members to assist in the relief effort to the Philippines to assist in the relief effort after Typhoon Haiyan and 54 more members are on the way. Deployment of the DART was completed on December 18. DART capabilities included engineering road clearance, medical assistance through Medical Mobile teams (MMT) and water purification. Operations are concentrated on Panay Island. Operation Renaissance 15-1 (Nepal) 2015 On April 26, 2015, DART deployed 200 personnel to assist with the engineering, medical aid and mapping in Nepal after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck.

Route 15 consists of four distinct sections: the Merritt Parkway, the Wilbur Cross Parkway, the Berlin Turnpike, and part of the Wilbur Cross Highway. The unified designation was applied to these separate highways in 1948 to provide a continuous through route from New York to Massachusetts. Route description=Merritt Parkway Signage at the state line in Greenwich Route 15 begins at the New York border, where the Hutchinson River Parkway continues southwest towards New York City, at the New York State Route 120A interchange in the village of Rye Brook, in the town of Rye, New York. The highway comes into the state of Connecticut, continuing as the Merritt Parkway, a four lane limited-access parkway with low bridges, sharp curves, and a tree-filled median, that passes through the affluent urbanized areas of southern Fairfield County. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on this section of Route 15. The parkway heads into the town of Greenwich, where it passes a service plaza in both directions and curves north-northwest, before heading northeast and meeting interchanges at Round Hill Road, providing access to Downtown Greenwich, and at Lake Avenue. From there, Route 15 turns northeast, and reverse turns through its interchange with North Street, which provides another outlet into Downtown Greenwich. Past this interchange, the parkway enters the city of Stamford, where it crosses over the Mianus River within the Mianus River State Park, before reaching an interchange with Route 104 in the residential areas of North Stamford, providing access to Downtown Stamford and the University of Connecticut Stamford Campus. Route 15 continues to an interchange with Route 137 before the route leaves Stamford. The parkway comes into the town of New Canaan, where it crosses the Noroton River within its interchange with Route 106, adjacent to the Talmadge Hill station on the New Canaan Branch of the Metro- North Railroad's New Haven Line, located to the southeast of the interchange. Afterwards, Route 15 passes under the New Canaan Branch and curves around to meet an interchange for Route 124 before reaching the New Canaan Service Plaza. After crossing the Fivemile River, the parkway enters the city of Norwalk and immediately comes to an interchange with Route 123, which provides access to the Norwalk Community College. Just past its crossing of the Silvermine River, Route 15 meets the U.S. Route 7 (US 7) freeway at an incomplete interchange before it crosses over the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Line just south of the Merritt 7 station, and the Norwalk River and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Main Avenue which provides the missing movements between the parkway and US 7. From there, Route 15 continues northeast through residential areas in the neighborhood of Cranbury before it leaves Norwalk, after crossing over Route 53 without an interchange. Merritt Parkway in Fairfield The parkway enters the town of Westport, where it crosses over the Saugatuck River, and comes to right-in/right-out interchanges with Route 33, just east of the town line. Route 15 turns to the northeast again, upon reaching its interchange with Route 57, that has a park and ride lot serving the town of Westport in its northwest corner. Immediately after this interchange, the parkway crosses over Route 136 with no access and enters its longest stretch without exits, where it passes more wooded residential areas and comes into the town of Fairfield, where it meets its next interchange, five and a half miles later, at Route 58, which also has a park and ride lot, located in its southeastern corner. Route 58 provides access to both Fairfield Center and the campus of Fairfield University. Route 15 crosses the Mill River, passes service plazas in both directions, and then meets Route 59 at a pair of right-in/right-out interchanges. Route 59 provides access to the headquarters of General Electric. The parkway turns east-northeast and enters the town of Trumbull at its interchange with Park Avenue, which provides access to the campus of Sacred Heart University just to the southwest of the road, as well as the campus of the University of Bridgeport in the adjacent city of Bridgeport. Route 15 then reaches a single-point urban interchange with Route 111, adjacent to the Westfield Trumbull shopping mall, in its southwestern corner. The parkway meets the Route 25 freeway at an incomplete turbine interchange, which provides access to the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport, and the route crosses the Pequonnock River within the interchange. Past Route 25, Route 15 reaches a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Route 127 and then a full interchange for Route 108, in tandem with stack interchange with the Route 8 freeway. Route 15 comes into the town of Stratford through more wooded suburban areas, and reaches an interchange with Route 110 at the northeastern edge of town. Past this interchange, the parkway runs due east to cross the Igor Sikorsky Memorial Bridge over the Housatonic River where it leaves both Stratford and Fairfield County. Route 15 enters both Milford and New Haven County, coming to a modified trumpet interchange with the Milford Parkway which provides access to both the I-95 freeway and US 1, north of Downtown Milford. At this point, the Merritt Parkway ends and Route 15 turns northeast again through the wooded residential areas of southwestern New Haven County. Wilbur Cross Parkway The next component of Route 15, the Wilbur Cross Parkway, begins at the Milford Parkway junction. The Wilbur Cross Parkway follows the same general configuration and landscape as the Merritt Parkway, continues with the Merritt Parkway's exit numbers, and excludes commercial vehicles from its use, too. A few miles after the Milford Parkway, Route 15 comes into the town of Orange, where it passes a bi-directional service plaza, and meets Route 121 at a pair of right-in/right-out ramps, which provides access to the Orange campus of the University of New Haven. Now running north-northeast, Route 15 continues to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 34 which provides access eastbound to the Yale Bowl, in the city of New Haven. The parkway crosses the Wepawaug River, where it turns northeast and enters the town of Woodbridge, passing under Route 114 without access. Route 15 again crosses a boundary and comes into New Haven, where it meets an interchange with Route 69/Route 63 that provides access to the campus of Southern Connecticut State University, in the neighborhood of Amity, crossing the West River within the interchange. Wilbur Cross Parkway approaching Heroes Tunnel From here, the parkway briefly crosses back through the southeastern corner of Woodbridge, before coming back into New Haven, and entering Heroes Tunnel which passes under West Rock Ridge. Immediately after exiting the tunnel, Route 15 comes into the town of Hamden, where it heads into a mix of residential and commercial areas around its interchange with Route 10, that also provides access to the Paier College of Art. The parkway then enters the town of North Haven, where it crosses the Mill River and passes under the Route 40 freeway as the only freeway crosspath in the state without an interchange, over East Rock. A short distance later, the parkway meets an interchange with Route 22 and continues northeast to the last pair of service plazas on the route. Past the plazas, Route 15 turns north-northeast along the western edge of the Quinnipiac River State Park, where the route enters the town of Wallingford. In Wallingford, the parkway has exits to Quinnipiac Street providing access to Gaylord Specialty Healthcare and the Wallingford station on Amtrak and ConnDOT's Hartford Line, as well as Route 150 that provides access to the Masonicare Health Center. Route 15 crosses the Quinnipiac River and turns northeast, where it comes to an interchange for US 5, where it also crosses the Hartford Line. Route 15 continues northeast into the city of Meriden and passes entrances to the ConnDOT maintenance facilities. The parkway continues a short distance before reaching an interchange complex on the east side of town. First, Route 15 crosses over the I-91 freeway, where it turns north to reach a southbound exit and northbound entrance, before meeting East Main Street, which provides access to the Wesleyan University campus, where the Interstate Highway begins to run inside the median. The parkway widens to six lanes through here, then reaches the next exits for northbound I-91 with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrance to and from the westbound direction of the I-691 freeway, where there is also access from westbound I-691 to the northbound Wilbur Cross Parkway. Past I-691, Route 15 narrows back to four lanes, and turns north-northwest before heading north-northeast again, where the Wilbur Cross Parkway ends and northbound US 5 merges with northbound Route 15 to head toward the suburban areas of Greater Hartford. Berlin Turnpike Berlin Turnpike Route 15 continues onto a four-lane divided surface highway concurrent with US 5, known as the Berlin Turnpike, running between Silver Lake to the west and Lamentation Mountain to the east. Here, it passes along a commercial strip before passing areas of residence. The highway enters the city of Berlin and Hartford County, and briefly forms the western edge of Lamentation Mountain State Park, before heading back into commercial areas. An old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike, splits to the west, while US 5/Route 15 reverse curve to their interchange with the Route 9 freeway and Route 372, in which all access besides the ramps from US 5/Route 15 to southbound Route 9 and from southbound Route 9 to US 5/Route 15 is made via Route 372. North of Route 9, the old alignment of the Berlin Turnpike rejoins the new road briefly, before splitting again, this time to the east. The highway crosses the Mattabesset River before intersecting the western terminus of Route 160. US 5/Route 15 passes rows of shopping centers, as it comes into the town of Newington, intersecting the southern terminus of Route 173, which heads north towards the town of West Hartford. The highway continues to its junction with the southern terminus of Route 176, which heads north towards the center of Newington. A park and ride lot is located in the northeastern corner of this intersection, with Griswoldville Avenue. From here, US 5/Route 15 passes the ConnDOT headquarters on the east, prior to reaching the intersections with Route 287. The highway leaves Newington at its interchange with Route 175, which heads west towards the center of town and east towards the town of Wethersfield. After the Route 175 interchange, US 5/Route 15 enters Wethersfield and passes more commercial areas before reaching the partial interchange with Route 314. The Berlin Turnpike splits and continues north-northeast along Route 314, narrowing to a two-lane undivided road, until it reaches the Hartford city line, continuing into that city as Maple Avenue. US 5/Route 15 exits onto a four-lane freeway that heads northeast towards I-91 as a limited-access outlet into Hartford. Wilbur Cross Highway Past Route 314, US 5/Route 15 continue onto the Wilbur Cross Highway, a four-lane freeway with a jersey barrier in the middle. The highway passes through wooded urbanized areas, to the southeast of the Connecticut Department of Labor headquarters, before it comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of Route 99, in which the overpass that carries the two routes over that route and the Providence and Worcester Railroad's Connecticut Valley Railroad line is called the Clinton \\"Jiggs\\" Hughes Memorial Bridge. Next, US 5/Route 15 comes into Hartford, turns north-northeast at an interchange with I-91, where there are ramps from northbound and southbound US 5/Route 15 to southbound I-91, and from northbound I-91 to northbound I-91 to southbound US 5/Route 15. The next interchange at Brainard Road/Airport Road with access to Hartford-Brainard Airport, has no southbound exit. The highway continues through industrial areas and comes exits from the southbound Wilbur Cross Highway to Southbound I-91, as well as an exit from the northbound Wilbur Cross Highway and northbound I-91 that also provides access to westbound I-84. Route 15 southbound in Hartford From here, US 5/Route 15 cross over the Connecticut River on the Charter Oak Bridge, where the routes enter the town of East Hartford. On the other side of the bridge, there is an interchange serving Route 2, where northbound US 5 splits and exits Route 15 onto Main Street, which runs north through the center of East Hartford. Route 15 reverse curves to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Silver Lane, before the highway reaches its northern terminus and merges onto eastbound I-84 and US 6. A dedicated connection also exists between Route 15 and I-84/US 6's high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The Wilbur Cross Highway continues northeast along I-84 towards Interstate 90/Massachusetts Turnpike in Sturbridge, Massachusetts.Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles: Registering a Pick-up Truck with Passenger Plates History The Route 15 designation was created as part of the 1932 state highway renumbering and originally ran from New Haven through Middletown, East Hartford and Stafford Springs to the Massachusetts state line in Union. The original route used the pre-expressway alignment of modern Route 17 to Glastonbury, Main Street to East Hartford center, U.S. Route 5 to the junction with Route 30, then modern Route 30 to Stafford, then modern Route 190 to Union, and modern Route 171 to the Massachusetts state line.kurumi.com - Route 15 In 1943, a newly constructed two-lane highway (now the Wilbur Cross Highway) between Tolland and Union was opened to traffic. Route 15 was relocated on this new highway and the former Route 15 between Route 74 and Route 190 (then part of Route 20) was redesignated as Route 30\\\\. By 1948, the rest of the old two-lane Wilbur Cross Highway to East Hartford had also opened, connecting to the Charter Oak Bridge and the Hartford Bypass. In 1948, the State Highway Department decided to relocate Route 15 to a series of roadways, namely the Merritt Parkway, Wilbur Cross Parkway, Berlin Turnpike, Hartford Bypass, Charter Oak Bridge, and the new Wilbur Cross Highway, creating a modern, high-speed throughway from the New York state line to the Massachusetts state line. The Route 15 designation was applied to the previously unnumbered parkways from Greenwich to Meriden, then overlaid with U.S. Route 5 through East Hartford, then designated on the southern half of the Wilbur Cross Highway to Tolland, connecting with the portion previously designated as Route 15 five years before. The former Route 15 between South Windsor and Tolland was reassigned as an extension of Route 30, and the former Route 15 between New Haven and Glastonbury became redesignated as Route 17. In 1948, a portion of the Wilbur Cross Parkway between Route 34 and Whitney Avenue had still been under construction. Route 15 was temporarily routed along Route 34, Sherman Avenue (former Routes 5 and 10), Henry Street/Munson Street/Hillside Place/Edwards Street (former Route 5), and Whitney Avenue (former Route 10A). By 1949, the Wilbur Cross Parkway was completed and the temporary Route 15 designation was removed from the surface streets. Further improvements in the Wilbur Cross Highway took place over the next several years and the road became a four-lane divided highway by 1954. In 1968, most of the Wilbur Cross Highway was designated as I-86 and further upgrades to the road were implemented. Route 15 and I-86 overlapped from the current 15/84 junction in East Hartford to the Massachusetts state line. In 1984, the overlap was removed, truncating Route 15 to its current northern end, while at the same time I-86 was redesignated as I-84.Larry Larned, \\"Route 15: The Road to Hartford\\", (Arcadia Publishing, 2002) Exit listReferencesExternal links *CT 15 (Greater New York Roads) 015 Transportation in Fairfield County, Connecticut Transportation in New Haven County, Connecticut Transportation in Hartford County, Connecticut U.S. Route 5 ","title":"Connecticut Route 15"},{"id":"1339512","text":"Frederick B.

US Congressman Martin Frost. During his campaign he advanced the idea of working with Mexico to develop Mexico's oil and gas resources with US technology and financial support, arguing that this would help bring down the cost of fuel, expand the economy in both countries and serve to decrease illegal immigration to the US. Mexico is believed to have the fifth largest untapped reserves of natural resources and is also the fifth largest oil and gas producer in the world.NASCO/Mineta NORTH AMERICA‚ÄôS SUPERHIGHWAY COALITION TRANSPORTATION FORUM / FORT WORTH, TX ReferencesExternal links For more on Lico Reyes' political and community activity 1946 births 2019 deaths University of Texas at Arlington alumni Texas Democrats Texas National Guard personnel American politicians of Mexican descent People from Durango People with acquired American citizenship Male actors from Texas ","title":"Lico Reyes"},{"id":"1339515","text":"Location of Sentinel Range in Western Antarctica.

Created in 1951, the district serves the communities of New Lenox, Frankfort, Mokena, Manhattan, and small portions of Tinley Park and Orland Park. Three high schools comprise Lincoln-Way Community High School District 210: Lincoln-Way Central, Lincoln-Way East, and Lincoln- Way West. Lincoln-Way Central and Lincoln-Way West are located in New Lenox; Lincoln-Way East is located in Frankfort. District 210 offices are located at Lincoln-Way Central. Effective since the 2016-2017 school year, due to financial troubles, Lincoln-Way Community High School District 210 consolidated to a three school district. The three schools comprising the district are Lincoln-Way Central, Lincoln-Way East, and Lincoln-Way West.  History  Each year the Lincoln-Way district continues to grow, gaining an average of 250 students per annum. Both Lincoln-Way Central and Lincoln-Way East are built to accommodate 3,750 students. While Lincoln-Way North and Lincoln-Way West are built to accommodate 2,500 students. During the 2007-2008 school year, Lincoln-Way East had over 4,100 students: causing massive overcrowding issues in classrooms and hallways. On March 21, 2006, voters approved - by 20% - a proposal to build 2 new schools in the next three years. Lincoln-Way North opened to Freshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors in 2008. North is located in Frankfort at the corner of Vollmer Road and Harlem, serving Frankfort Square, parts of Mokena and Tinley Park. The mascot is the Lincoln- Way North Phoenix. Their colors are Vegas gold and black. Lincoln-Way West opened to the same classes in 2009 in New Lenox at Illinois Highway and Gougar Road. Their mascot is the Lincoln-Way West Warriors, with their new colors being orange and black.

It stars Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, and Tom Sizemore. Set in the last two days of 1999, the film follows the story of a black marketeer of recordings that allow a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations as he attempts to uncover the truth behind the murder of a prostitute. Blending science fiction with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and voyeurism. Although the story was conceived by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration after incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. The film was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles Area over a period of 77 nights. Some of the film's scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A major box-office bomb, Strange Days almost derailed Bigelow's career, making little more than a sixth of its $42 million production cost. Upon release, the film polarized film critics; some reviewers praised its gritty atmosphere and the performances by Fiennes and Bassett, while others criticized it for failing to comment on its violence. Nevertheless, the film's critical standing has improved over the years, with many fans feeling that the film has been overlooked by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award. Plot In the last two days of 1999, Los Angeles has become a dangerous war zone. As a group of criminals rob a Chinese restaurant, the event is recorded by a robber wearing a SQUID, an illegal electronic device that records memories and physical sensations directly from the wearer's cerebral cortex onto a MiniDisc-like device for playback. Lenny Nero, a former LAPD officer turned black marketeer of SQUID recordings, buys the robbery clip from his main supplier, Tick. Elsewhere, a prostitute named Iris, who is a former friend of Lenny's ex-girlfriend Faith Justin, is being chased by LAPD officers Burton Steckler and Dwayne Engelman. Iris escapes on a subway car but Engleman pulls off her wig, revealing a SQUID recorder headset. Lenny pines for Faith and relies on emotional support from his two best friends: bodyguard and limousine driver Lornette \\"Mace\\" Mason and private investigator Max Peltier. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from when he was still a cop and stepped in as a dependable father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max are drinking together at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car before it is towed away. Mace picks Lenny up and takes him to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. There, Lenny receives a SQUID disc from a contact and unsuccessfully tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, Philo Gant. Gant is a music industry mogul who managed the recently-slain rapper Jeriko One. While in the car with Mace, Lenny plays the disc the contact gave him and watches Iris being brutally raped and murdered by an attacker at the Sunset Regent hotel. As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, they take the disc to Tick, who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left. Mace takes Lenny to her brother's house and they watch Iris's disc, showing Iris was with Jeriko One when Steckler and Engleman pulled him over and murdered him because his anti-police lyrics and activism incited protests against the LAPD. The two return to Tick, whom Max reveals has been rendered brain-dead from forceful exposure to amplified SQUID signals. Lenny fears Iris' attacker covered his tracks by \\"killing\\" Tick and will come after Faith. Back at the nightclub, Lenny and Mace confront Faith, who reveals that Philo is afraid Iris' disc would reveal that he kept his artists under surveillance. Lenny and Mace disagree over whether to trade the disc to Philo for Faith's freedom or release it publicly, which could incite a citywide riot. As midnight approaches, Lenny and Mace sneak into a private party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel that Philo is hosting for the city's wealthy elite. Lenny has a change of heart and tells Mace to give the disc to deputy police commissioner Palmer Strickland. In Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds Philo brain-dead on the floor and another disc, revealing that Max and Faith are lovers, and that Max \\"fried\\" Philo's brain with an amplified recording of them feigning rape. Faith explains to Lenny that Philo hired Max to kill Iris, but when Philo wanted Faith dead as part of the coverup, Max decided to frame Lenny for the murders. Lenny and Max struggle in a fight, which culminates with Lenny throwing Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the crowded streets, Mace subdues Steckler and Engelman but other officers take down Mace. Strickland arrives and orders Mace's release and to arrest Steckler and Engelman for murder. Engelman commits suicide; Steckler threatens Mace but the officers gun him down. Lenny then finds Mace and the two share a kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century. CastProduction=Development Producer James Cameron conceived the story of Strange Days around 1986. The story of Strange Days was originally conceived by producer James Cameron around 1986. He eventually presented it to his former wife and director Kathryn Bigelow, who immediately found it impressive. According to her, \\"These two characters on the eve of the millennium, with one character trying to get the woman who loves him to help him save the woman he loves. It's this great emotional matrix.\\" After a series of dialogues, Cameron and Bigelow developed the film's society and political element. Cameron focused more on the romantic side, while Bigelow centered more on \\"the edginess, the grit\\" part of the film, which was something she was always interested in. Cameron later wrote a 90-page treatment based on these dialogues, stating that \\"It was practically a novel, but it was unwieldy; it needed structure.\\" The treatment was then presented to screenwriter Jay Cocks, who turned it into a script. Cameron felt that the resulting script was very well structured and only did a dialogue polish on top of it. Bigelow was motivated to start work on Strange Days shortly after a series of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, \\"I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live.\\" She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make \\"valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression.\\" The film was named after the 1967 song of the same name by The Doors. Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million. Casting Although the script for Strange Days was completed in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role \\"required somebody who had a tremendous amount of intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply.\\" Cameron, however, felt that a \\"glibber and slicker\\" actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny \\"a sexier character‚Äîa guy you can care about very much.\\" In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated because the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching. Filming The shooting for Strange Days was originally intended to start on May 12, 1994, but was delayed to June 6, 1994 because the full cast list was incomplete. Bigelow said that the O. J. Simpson murder case \\"[echoed] the film events\\", adding that Strange Days was filmed during the Summer and Fall of that year. The film was entirely shot in the Greater Los Angeles Area over a period of 77 nights. Producer Steven-Charles Jaffe said that the city was generally very cooperative, except for the subway scene as the team only had four hours a night to film it. Jaffe, however, remarked that Bigelow \\"was so well prepared that what would have taken another director several weeks to do, she did in a matter of days.\\" The production team also received permission from the West Hollywood film commission to film on Sunset Boulevard for a two-day period, which required the shut down of several lanes of traffic. The scene where the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century at the end of the film was shot at the corner of the 5th and Flower streets, between the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and the Los Angeles Public Library. Over 50 off-duty police officers were hired to control an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, who had to pay $10 in advance to attend the event. The film-makers also hired rave promoters Moss Jacobs and Philip Blaine to produce performances featuring Aphex Twin, Deee-Lite, as well as \\"all the cyber-techno bands they could garner\\". It was reported that a total of $750,000 was spent on the event, and half of the 1,300 rooms in the Bonaventure were rented out. The event started at 9 p.m. on a Saturday night and ended shortly before its scheduled end at 4 a.m., as five people were hospitalized for suffering overdoses of the drug Ecstasy. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce the effect of looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially \\"a stripped-down Arri that weighed much less than the smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses.\\" Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to co-ordinate and has hidden cuts. For example, the jump was filmed with a helmet camera, while the run up a stair escape required a Steadicam. According to Cameron, \\"We designed transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical.\\" The sequence where Iris runs in front of a speeding freight train was shot backwards, with the train backing up. The footage was then reversed during editing. Music International music was chosen as the primary music style of Strange Days due to its variety of sounds and instruments. According to music supervisor Randy Gerston, who previously worked on True Lies, this type of music helped the film-makers create a futuristic atmosphere, noting that \\"the world is shrinking and people are getting acclimated to strange languages being part of the pop vernacular.\\" Michael Kamen was the first composer hired to create a score for the film. Michel Sanchez and √âric Mouquet, the French duo known as Deep Forest, were then hired to replace Kamen's work. In addition to their score, Deep Forest teamed with Peter Gabriel to write an original song for the film's end credits, titled \\"While the Earth Sleeps\\". Australian composer Graeme Revell, fresh off writing an acclaimed score for The Crow, was then hired to replace most of Deep Forest's work, and he wrote the electronic-driven score used in the finished film. Revell also teamed with singer-songwriter Lori Carson to write an original song that appears over the film's final scene, titled \\"Fall In The Light\\". Bigelow was a fan of English musician PJ Harvey, and chose two of her songs, \\"Rid of Me\\" and \\"Hardly Wait\\", to be performed onscreen by Lewis. Alternative rock band Skunk Anansie appeared in the film, performing at the New Year's Eve event, and were encouraged to jam between takes, so Bigelow could record them live and give the rave greater authenticity. Although the band would have a live sound on the film, they ultimately had to lip-sync. Other musicians featured on the soundtrack included British trip hop artist Tricky, Belgian electronic group Lords of Acid and American heavy metal band Prong. A soundtrack album was released on October 3, 1995. In addition, 60,000 promotional CD-ROMs, which contained production material from the film and music clips from the soundtrack, were made available only through the \\"College Special\\" issue of Rolling Stone magazine that was sold at record stores. Themes Although Strange Days is generally classified as a science fiction thriller, the film uses multiple dramatic and narrative elements, including film noir conventions like the femme fatale (Faith Justin). The terms \\"techno- thriller\\", \\"tech-noir\\", and \\"futuristic erotic thriller\\" have also been used. In 2001, cultural critic Steven Shaviro compared Strange Days to Cameron's earlier films, stating that the film \\"has characters that the viewer is supposed to identify with, and a plot full of thrills, exciting action sequences and unexpected twists. But at the same time, Strange Days is very much an experimental film, one that questions and inverts the traditional and Hollywood structures of identification and involvement, in ways that are consonant with the ideas that have been put forward by feminist film criticism over the last thirty years.\\" The film's dystopian society and use of SQUID technology, which has been compared to the \\"simstim\\" technology in William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, were also considered cyberpunk concepts. The film explores controversial themes such as racism, abuse of power, and rape. Voyeurism is also a major element due to the protagonist's extensive use of SQUID technology. The fact that the film was directed by a woman was even more controversial, with film critic Michael Mirasol noting that had Strange Days been directed by a man, these scenes would likely have been criticized as sexist and misogynistic. Nevertheless, Bigelow insisted that the film does not glorify violence and that it has a positive purpose. According to her, \\"I wanted to treat 'the system' fairly, because if it's the enemy, then we're the enemy, since by not changing it we're reproducing it... The film ends in a strong insistence on hope. Ultimately it's humanity - not technology - that takes us into the next century and the next millennium.\\" In 2015, The Washington Post editor Sonny Bunch felt that Strange Days was still relevant, comparing the imagery captured by the SQUID units to that of first-person shooters or cellphone videos on YouTube. He added that events such as Jeriko One's murder and the subsequent coverup of the crime contribute to activist movements like Black Lives Matter, and that their media documentation amplifies their reception and consequences. Mace was seen as a strong yet very feminine female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the \\"hard-edged, reality-based\\" component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, \\"This is your life! Right here! Right now! It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time to get real, not playback!\\" The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries. Bigelow considered Strange Days her most personal film, claiming that \\"It's a synthesis of all the different tracks I've been exploring, either deliberately or unconsciously, ever since I started making art.\\" Release=Box office Strange Days premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 6, 1995, grossing $31,062 on that weekend. It expanded a week later on October 13, 1995 in 1,691 theaters and grossed $3,656,012 on its opening weekend. The film's poor performance at the box office was compared to Jade and The Scarlet Letter, which opened at the same time and had a similar budget. Overall, the film went on to make $7,959,291 in North America, little more than a sixth of its $42 million production cost. As a result, Strange Days was considered a commercial failure, due in part to the poor marketing strategy and lack of audience understanding. The film almost derailed Bigelow's career, as five years would pass before she directed her next film, The Weight of Water. Critical reception Upon release, Strange Days polarized film critics. Roger Ebert, who gave the film four out of four stars, described it as \\"a technical tour de force\\" and highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that \\"Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience to deal with the screen reality, instead of allowing us to process it as routine 'action.'\\" The film's technical aspects were also praised by Variety editor Todd McCarthy, who remarked that no other film since Lady in the Lake in 1947 had \\"experimented so extensively with the subjective camera\\". In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B-\\" rating, concluding that Strange Days \\"has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that \\"Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well- reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts.\\" New York magazine writer David Denby called the rape scene \\"the sickest sequence in modern movies\\". The performances of the lead characters were highlighted very positively. Writing for Chicago Tribune, film critic Michael Wilmington praised Fiennes' performance because it captures \\"the weaselly, pleading side of Lenny\\", while noting \\"the slight formality of his diction\\", which he felt gives the character depth. Similarly, in her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that Fiennes \\"gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing there is something about this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary.\\" As for Bassett, she felt that the character \\"looks great and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's \\"magnum opus\\" and credited Bassett's \\"standout\\" performance, describing her as \\"fierce, funny and heart rending\\". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award. Retrospectively, the film's critical standing has improved. Roger Ebert's correspondent Michael Mirasol felt that Strange Days had some obvious weaknesses, including a dialogue that is too polished for its setting, but nevertheless judged its \\"devotion to its characters, its remarkable use of POVs to create its consistent atmosphere of apprehension and excitement, and most of all, its fearlessness.\\" In 2009, Drew Morton of the Pajiba website considered Strange Days an \\"extremely underappreciated film\\" and \\"the best piece of cyberpunk to grace celluloid since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.\\" Strange Days also garnered a small cult following, who felt that the film has been overlooked by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on reviews from 45 critics, with an average rating of 6.09/10. The website's consensus states: \\"Strange Days struggles to make the most of its futuristic premise, but what's left remains a well-directed, reasonably enjoyable sci-fi fantasy.\\" Home media Strange Days was released on VHS in the United States by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on April 2, 1996. A special widescreen THX LaserDisc was released in the United States on May 22, 1996. The LaserDisc's special features included a 1-hour lecture about how the opening scene was filmed, two deleted scenes, a music video for \\"Selling Jesus\\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the original teaser and theatrical trailers, and photo galleries of storyboards and production stills. On September 28, 1999, the film was released on DVD in the United States, containing all the features from the LaserDisc version, except for the music video and photo galleries.

It transmits on a 5,000-Watt signal that can be heard in seven U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. KFYR also broadcasts on translator K259AF (99.7 FM) in Bismarck. 99.7 FM was previously a simulcast of KQDY 94.5 FM before 2011. KFYR boasts an enormous coverage area. It can be heard across almost all of North Dakota during the day, as well as in parts of Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nebraska. This owes to a combination of its position only one channel from the bottom of the North American AM dial, the height and power of its transmitter, and North Dakota's flat land. On the AM band, lower frequencies have longer waves, which tend to travel farther across terrain. This is especially true for stations that operate at 5,000 watts or more. Additionally, the flat landscape of the prairies makes for near-perfect ground conductivity, giving KFYR a coverage area comparable to that of a full-power FM station. At night, two towers are used in a directional pattern to protect CBK, the CBC Radio One outlet for most of Saskatchewan, which operates on nearby 540 AM. Even with this restriction, it still covers almost all of North Dakota at night. KFYR is the primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System in both North and South Dakota. It has been claimed that KFYR has the largest land coverage area in the United States of any AM radio station during daytime hours. A similar claim can be made for WNAX in Yankton, South Dakota, which transmits on 570AM. History KFYR was founded in 1925 by Phillip J. Meyer and his wife, Etta Hoskins Meyer. It is Bismarck's oldest radio station. For many years, it was an NBC radio affiliate. In December 1953 it spawned a television station (KFYR-TV, western North Dakota's NBC television affiliate, and its three semi- satellites) and in 1966, KFYR-FM at 92.9 (now KYYY) began operation. At one time, the roster also included AM radio stations in Billings and Great Falls, Montana, as well as an FM station in Minot, North Dakota. The station group was known as \\"The Meyer Broadcasting Company\\" and remained under the ownership of the Meyer family until 1998. KFYR began operation with programming for only a few hours daily, signing off between shows. By 1950, the station had expanded its schedule to an 18-hour broadcast day. Early programming included live studio musicians, transcribed music and programs, and live feeds from the NBC Radio Network. Many popular \\"soap operas\\", sporting events, religious broadcasts, children's programs, and musical performances were part of the regular schedule. The station carried NBC's Monitor on weekends, and Nightline on weeknights. Other programming included local news, weather, and sports, locally originated variety programs such as \\"What's The Weather\\" weekday mornings and \\"The Northwest Farmfront\\" weekdays at noon. Mike Dosch, an established musician from Strasburg, North Dakota (Lawrence Welk's hometown) was featured on several of the live shows and had his own late-night program of organ music for many years. There were also shows hosted by staff announcers who played recorded popular music by such artists as Nat King Cole, Doris Day, The Ames Brothers, Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians, and orchestras including Mantovani, Percy Faith, and Frank Chacksfield. Facing stiff competition from less formal local stations along with regional outlets in Fargo, Minot, and Jamestown, North Dakota and Winnipeg, Canada, KFYR began to see its dominance and audience decline in the early 1960s and switched to a Top 40 format. It was very popular with teenagers by virtue of its \\"torrid twenty\\" countdown show, which featured the twenty popular hits of the week. In the 1960s and 1970s, teenagers from South Dakota to parts of Canada enjoyed listening to \\"their\\" music on KFYR every evening (along with KOMA from Oklahoma City, KAAY from Little Rock, WLS from Chicago, and KSTP from St Paul). KFYR gained brief national notoriety in 1979, when it was sued in federal court by the Pointer Sisters and Elektra Records, for KFYR's remix of their cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Fire\\" with \\"K-Fire\\" dubbed into the chorus where \\"fire\\" would be said; the suit was settled out of court. KFYR once broadcast in AM stereo, beginning with the Harris system in the mid-1980s, and later switching to the Motorola C-QUAM system. KFYR discontinued broadcasting in AM stereo around the turn of the millennium.https://web.archive.org/web/20011207073537/http://users.hfx.eastlink.ca/~amstereo/offenders.htm The AM STEREO Page - Offenders of The Faith Today, KFYR runs a News/Talk format, with a mix of Adult Contemporary music on weekends, with Saturday Night at the Oldies from 6pm-12am.

Acting as an umbrella organization for 180 local NGOs across 105 communities in the country, Latet provides for the basic needs of populations living in poverty and food insecurity. The organization operates a national food bank and runs several aid and educational programs. Among its core activities, Latet distributes $30 million worth of food annually to 60,000 families in need and 1,000 Holocaust survivors living in poverty.  Mission  Latet was established in order to reduce poverty, for a better and more just society, by providing assistance to populations in need on a universal basis, mobilizing Israeli civil society towards mutual responsibility and leading change in national priorities.  History  When it was established, in addition to combatting poverty in Israel, Latet specialized in sending emergency aid delegations and humanitarian assistance abroad following wars and natural disasters : Kosovo and Rwanda after the civil wars in 1997 and 1999, India after the earthquake in 1999, Sri Lanka after the tsunami in 2005 and Haiti following the earthquake in 2010. After the emergency delegation to Haiti, the organization changed its course of action to focus on reducing poverty and providing assistance in Israel only.  Organization's purpose  According to a 2016 official report by the Israeli National Insurance Institute, 462,000 families (that is 1,802,000 individuals) live in poverty in Israel, of which 838,500 are children. Furthermore, nearly 955,000 families live in food insecurity (18% of the general population). In its efforts to relieve poverty and alleviate food insecurity, Latet has developed an operating model that enables the annual distribution of $30 million worth of food to 60,000 families in need across the country. Believing that Israeli civil society is an inherent part of the solution for reducing poverty, Latet carries out numerous annual initiatives to raise awareness among the general public: public displays, food drives and a national telethon. Moreover, the organization relies on more than 19,000 volunteers who annually join Latet's activities, providing 400,000 hours of voluntary service. Latet considers the government to be the main factor responsible for reducing poverty, as does 75.6% of the general public, according to a public survey published in Latet's Alternative Poverty Report. The organization regularly lobbies the government to bring change to the national agenda. Latet publishes an annual Alternative Poverty Report which takes the human factor of poverty into account and organizes an annual conference discussing poverty.  Values  Latet is a non-governmental, non-political, non-partisan and non-profit organization. The organization defines its core values as : * Equality and universality: equivalent aid is given to all areas of the country and to all sectors of the population, regardless of religion, race, gender and culture. * Professionalism and operational efficiency: the organization has developed a sustainable model of action through strategic partnerships and pooling of resources with leaders in the food industry and other NGOs. Latet also uses measures of effectiveness and has received the Midot Seal of Effectiveness . * Low overhead: strict adherence to 6% overhead. * Transparency: all financial data regarding the operation of the organization can be found on Latet's website, including the annual financial audits conducted by Kost, Forer, Gabbay and Kasierer (Ernst & Young) .  Areas of action = The nutritional security initiative  The initiative consists of rescuing and distributing food nationwide. With three logistic centers located in the north, center and south of Israel, Latet is one of the leading food banks and operates as an umbrella organization for 180 local NGOs across 105 communities, providing them with food products on a regular basis. These local associations then redistribute the food to people in need. 60,000 families receive assistance from Latet every month. Every year, Latet rescues and distributes between $25-$30 million worth of food. The organization primarily rescues and distributes dry food products (canned food, rice, pasta, oil, sugar, flour, and more) and over the past five years has also started distributing dairy products and poultry. The modus operandi of the organization relies on long-lasting partnerships with leading companies in the food industry (Osem, Strauss, Tnuva, Coca-Cola, Unilever, etc). Since 2015, Latet has been working in cooperation with the Manufacturers Association of Israel's Association of Food Industries to encourage, regulate and expand food rescue in Israel among food companies. This collaboration has led to more than 20 new food companies joining the food salvaging circle in 2016-2017. These partnerships have social (assist families in need), economical (save food destruction costs) and environmental (avoid food waste) advantages. Along with the food rescue, food purchasing takes place regularly in order to provide all the necessary products for the basic food package Latet distributes.  Aid for Life ‚Äì Holocaust survivors  According to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims in Israel, 45,000 out of the 189,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel live below the poverty line. Latet's Aid for Life program was created in 2007 with the goal of giving direct assistance to Holocaust survivors in need. The program provides the most impoverished Holocaust survivors with a holistic aid package tailored to their needs: * A monthly food box is delivered at the survivor's home every month and is built in cooperation with nutritionists to adapt to elderly people's needs. * Ongoing social support: each survivor is partnered with an individual volunteer who visits him on a regular basis. Latet also hosts festive dinners for Jewish holidays and social events throughout the year. In 2018, 1,300 volunteers kept the survivors company on an ongoing basis and brought them to dozens of events that were organized across the country. * Emergency Fund: the fund was created to supply medical and paramedical items and services such as eyeglasses, incontinence products, dental care, emergency alert systems, and household maintenance. These are expensive products most survivors in need cannot afford. The emergency fund helps them resolve issues quickly and allows the survivors to regain their independence. * Home restorations: some survivors live in run-down apartments that often lack accessibility. This project has been implemented since 2014 to ensure survivors‚Äô homes are safe and secure. The restorations are managed by Latet staff and led by a professional contractor, at no cost to the survivors. Within 4 years, the project has renovated 1,550 apartments, improving the survivors' quality of life and personal security.  Latet Youth organization  Latet Youth is an organization recognized by the Israeli Ministry of Education that is dedicated to the nurturing of Israeli teens as caring citizens guided by values of volunteering and mutual responsibility. The teenagers spend time visiting and volunteering in different places (schools, community centers, retirement homes, etc.). During the last year of the three-year program, the youth implement social micro-initiatives within their own communities, developing their entrepreneurial and leadership skills. The youth organization operates nationwide and brings together 2,500 participants from all backgrounds. 40% of the participants are defined as \\"at-risk youth\\" and 70% come from a disadvantaged socioeconomic background. Every year, Latet Youth's members carry out 150 social micro-initiatives. Some of these initiatives have received national media coverage, like the \\"Thank You Day\\" and the \\"Gift Room at the Soroka Medical Center\\".  Advocacy and Awareness  The project's aim is to bring about change in Israel's national priorities and to raise social awareness about poverty and food insecurity. Year long, Latet is committed to carrying out various activities in order to fulfill this goal: * Alternative Poverty Report: this is an annual report which sheds light on the most up-to-date trends in poverty and nutritional insecurity in Israel. The report is published by Latet in collaboration with the ERI research institute. This report is a multidimensional analysis of what poverty means and presents alternative numbers in contrast to the narrower definition of poverty by the National Insurance Institute of Israel. * Poverty conference: this annual conference is one of the most prominent events related to poverty and social gaps, while discussing solutions for reducing poverty. The conference molds the public discourse and gathers associations' directors, academics, economists, politicians, private companies' directors, artists, etc. * Public fundraising campaigns: twice a year, around the holidays (Rosh Hashanah and Passover), Latet runs extensive fundraising and awareness campaigns. As part of these activities, the organization organizes food drives in the largest supermarket chain Shufersal in order to collect food products from customers. In 2017, 36,500 food boxes (containing dozens of food products) were collected from the supermarket chain. For Rosh Hashanah, Latet holds an annual telethon on national television in partnership with leading live TV shows, like Master Chef Israel, during which the organization raises hundreds of thousands of Holiday meal for people in need. * Large-scale public displays are held in important public places in order to raise the awareness of the general population to the poverty issue.  Partnerships and impact on Israeli society  Latet receives wide public support from Israeli society and estimates that since its creation in 1996, nearly 2,000,000 Israelis have donated time, money and food products to support Latet's efforts and more than 100,000 volunteers have participated to the organization's activities. Latet is one of the most well-known organizations in Israel and has been recognized as a \\"Super Brand\\" by the Superbrands organization, along the Mossad and the IDF. 98% of Israelis know Latet (98% brand recognition and 52% brand recall). 90% of Latet's budget comes from Israeli society (general public, private sector and foundations) and 7% from abroad (foundations, federations and private donors). Some of Latet's largest supporters are UJA-Federation of New York, Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, Fondation pour la M√©moire de la Shoah, and FSJU.

Designed by J. O'Neill and W.H. Byrne and built in the French Gothic style of local limestone ashlar in 1884. The church is famous for its tall west gable, rose window and for containing the national shrine of St. Oliver Plunkett. History The view of the nave looking north to the altar During the time of the Penal Laws, Catholic chapels were barred within a town's walls. Therefore, Drogheda's Catholic chapel was outside the Westgate and was inadequate for the needs of the populace. A plot of land on a suitable site in West Street (Drogheda's main street) was persistently refused by the corporation. Eventually, through the influence of a Mr. Chester, who was a wealthy Catholic, a lease was finally secured. A ceremony was held for all to witness Richard O'Reilly, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all-Ireland laying the foundation stone. Although the occasion was marred by an unseemly interruption, when the Mayor and Drogheda corporation arrived at the ceremony wearing their official regalia, with the Mace and Sword of state being borne before them, to confront the Archbishop. They warned him that a 'Popish Chapel' would not be tolerated within the town walls. Sir Edward Bellew of Barmeath Castle, a Catholic, stepped forward and convinced the mayor and corporation and their fellow travelers to withdraw. The proceedings continued without further ado and the foundation stone was duly laid.Drogheda Corporation, Minute Book, fol. 9669 The first Church on the site was completed in 1793 to a design by Francis Johnston (who designed the spire of the nearby Church of Ireland of the same name) to a cost in the region of ¬£12,000.Drogheda: its place in Ireland's history.

It is one of the most notable buildings on West Street in the town centre of Drogheda. The building from 1793 was partly incorporated into the present building. The tower of the church is very similar to that of St. Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone. A detail image of that building is held at the Highlanes Gallery, illustrated on a mid 19th Century (ca. 1861) map of the town created by Isaiah Rowland CE. The Church is famous for housing the National Shrine to St. Oliver Plunkett, who was martyred at Tyburn in 1681. The shrine is most elaborate and contains the preserved head of the saint. Another showcase displays his shoulder blade and other bones as relics. Also on exhibit is the cell door of Newgate prison in which he spent his last days.

Development=AQM-37 In 1959, the US Navy and US Air Force issued a joint request for a new high-speed expendable target. Beechcraft won the competition, and the result was a small delta-winged drone with wingtip fins and a liquid rocket motor, originally designated XKD2B-1 but now known as the AQM-37. The type first flew in May 1961, entered service with the US Navy in 1963, and remains in service. The original version was the AQM-37A or Beech Model 1019. The AQM-37A was followed by a confusing list of subvariants, some of which were new production, others which were modifications of existing AQM-37s. These variants were intended to simulate different classes of threats, such as sea-skimming antiship missiles or high-altitude naval attack missiles, or provide better performance. One high-performance variant with improved thermal protection attained a speed of Mach 4.7 and an altitude of over 112,000 feet (34 kilometers) on a ballistic trajectory. The final US Navy variant was designated AQM-37C. After an evaluation of the AQM-37A in the late 1960s, the US Army bought a small initial batch of Model 1100/1101 AQM-37As that, unlike other variants, were recoverable, using a parachute system. Some of this batch were intended for low-altitude operation and fitted with a radar altimeter, and others were intended for high-altitude operation and had a barometric altimeter. The Army later ordered over 400 improved non-recoverable Model 1102 variants of the AQM-37A. The USAF evaluated the AQM-37 in the early 1970s but was slow to adopt it. Records of USAF procurement of the type are sketchy, but it does seem to be currently part of the Air Force target inventory. Small quantities of AQM-37s were also sold to Italy, Israel, and France, while Britain bought several hundred of the type. The Meteor company of Italy built a number of AQM-37s under license. All variants are air- launched, with the US Navy traditionally using the F-4 Phantom for the job and the British using the Canberra. More than 5,000 AQM-37 targets of all variants have been delivered since the early 1960s. The AQM-37C/D is still in limited production for the U.S. Navy. The AQM-37's engine is built by Rocketdyne, though in some sources it is credited to Harley Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, which appears to be due to a sequence of company buyouts. The engine uses \\"storable\\" liquid propellants, in contrast to cryogenic propellants like liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen that have to be loaded up just before launch lest they evaporate away. The problem is that the storable propellants in common use are corrosive, highly toxic, and \\"hypergolic\\", meaning that the propellants spontaneously ignite when mixed together. This tends to make them troublesome to deal with. AQM-81A Firebolt An AQM-81A Firebolt Model 305 high altitude, high speed target (HAHST) drone. As a result, in the late 1960s the Air Force investigated an alternate propulsion scheme for the AQM-37 under project \\"Sandpiper\\". The program involved fitting a few AQM-37As with \\"hybrid\\" engines that used solid fuel with storable nitric acid oxidizer. The tests were judged promising, and so the Air Force went on to establish a \\"High Altitude Supersonic Target (HAST)\\" program in the 1970s. HAST suffered various difficulties, and it wasn't until 1979 that a contract was awarded to Teledyne Ryan for the Model 305 / AQM-81A Firebolt. The first Firebolt flew on 13 June 1983, launched from an Eglin AFB, Florida, F-4D Phantom II.Wagner, William, with Sloan, William P., \\"Fireflies and Other UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)\\", Aerofax, San Antonio, Texas, 1992, Library of Congress card number 92-072598, , pages 127, 129. The new target looked very much like the AQM-37, but had the hybrid rocket engine. The flight test program was completed, but then the HAST effort stalled completely, and the AQM-81A never went into production.

Traditionally, intuitive notions of area are formalized as a classical, countably additive measure. This has the unfortunate effect of leaving some sets with no well-defined area; a consequence is that some geometric transformations do not leave area invariant, the substance of the Banach-Tarski paradox. A Banach measure is a type of generalized measure to elide this problem. A Banach measure on a set is a finite measure on , the power set of , such that for every . A Banach measure on which takes values in } is called an Ulam measure on . As Vitali's paradox shows, Banach measures cannot be strengthened to countably additive ones. Stefan Banach showed that it is possible to define a Banach measure for the Euclidean plane, consistent with the usual Lebesgue measure. The existence of this measure proves the impossibility of a Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox in two dimensions: it is not possible to decompose a two-dimensional set of finite Lebesgue measure into finitely many sets that can be reassembled into a set with a different measure, because this would violate the properties of the Banach measure that extends the Lebesgue measure..

It is specifically used for second-stage disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense when the central nervous system is involved. For Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, eflornithine or fexinidazole is usually preferred. It is effective in about 95% of people. It is given by injection into a vein. Melarsoprol has a high number of side effects. Common side effects include brain dysfunction, numbness, rashes, and kidney and liver problems. About 1-5% of people die during treatment. In those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, red blood cell breakdown may occur. It has not been studied in pregnancy. It works by blocking pyruvate kinase, an enzyme required for aerobic metabolism by the parasite Melarsoprol has been used medically since 1949. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In regions of the world where the disease is common, melarsoprol is provided for free by the World Health Organization. It is not commercially available in Canada or the United States. In the United States, it may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in Canada it is available from Health Canada. Medical uses People diagnosed with trypanosome-caused disease should be treated with an anti- trypanosomal. Treatment is based on stage, 1 or 2, and parasite,T. b. rhodesiense or T. b. gambiense. In stage 1 disease, trypanosomes are present only in the peripheral circulation. In stage 2 disease, trypanosomes have crossed the blood brain barrier and are present in the central nervous system. The following are considerable treatment options: Melarsoprol is a treatment used during the second stage of the disease. So far, it is the only treatment available for late-stage T. b. rhodesiense. Due to high toxicity, melarsoprol is reserved only for the most dangerous cases. Other agents associated with lower toxicity levels are used during stage 1 of the disease. The approval of the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) in 2009 for the treatment of T. b. gambiense limited the use of melarsoprol in the treatment of second-stage T. b. rhodesiense. Failure rates of 27% in certain African countries have been reported. This was caused by both drug resistance and additional mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated. Resistance is likely due to transport problems associated with the P2 transporter, an adenine- adenosine transporter. Resistance can occur with point mutations within this transporter. Resistance has been present since the 1970s. Side effects Although melarsoprol cures about 96% of people with late stage disease, its toxicity limits its use. About 1-5% of people die during treatment. As a toxic organic compound of arsenic, melarsoprol is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection under the supervision of a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as \\"arsenic in antifreeze\\". Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions are associated with melarsoprol. It is known to cause a range of side effects including convulsions, fever, loss of consciousness, rashes, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. In approximately 5-10% of cases, it causes encephalopathy. Of those, about 50% die due to encephalopathy-related adverse reactions. Additional potentially serious side effects of melarsoprol include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure. Cautions Numerous warnings must be examined before melarsoprol treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating of the heart or arrhythmias, any damage to the heart muscles and potential signs of heart failure), preexisting nervous system disorders, and any signs of leprosy. Routine laboratory testing is needed before and after melarsoprol initiation. Laboratory parameters for both therapeutic effects and toxic effects need to be evaluated. Blood analysis is used to detect the presence of trypanosomes. An evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture is also used to determine an individual's white blood count and level of protein. These are diagnostic criteria such that the presence of trypanosomes, an elevated white blood count greater than five per microliter, or a protein content greater than 40 mg are considered abnormal and initiation should be considered. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be repeated every six months for at least three years in individuals that have undergone melarsoprol treatment. To assess potential concerns related to toxicity, the following should be completed: a complete blood count, an assessment of electrolyte levels, liver and kidney function tests, and a urinalysis to detect the appearance, concentration and content of the urine. Melarsoprol should be given using glass syringes (if they can be reliably sterilised). The propylene glycol it contains is capable of dissolving plastic. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Currently, melarsoprol is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The World Health Organization suggests that treatment be deferred until immediately after delivery since the effects of the medication on the developing fetus have not yet been established. Lactation guidelines associated with melarsoprol have not yet been established. Mechanism of action Melarsoprol is a prodrug, which is metabolized to melarsen oxide (Mel Ox) as its active form. Mel Ox is an phenylarsonous acid derivative that irreversibly binds to sulfhydryl groups on pyruvate kinase, which disrupts energy production in the parasite. The inability to distinguish between host and parasite PK renders this drug highly toxic with many side effects. Mel Ox also reacts with trypanothione (a spermidine-glutathione adduct that replaces glutathione in trypanosomes). It forms a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) that competitively inhibits trypanothione reductase, effectively killing the protist. Dosage Two arsenic-containing stereoisomers exist in a 3:1 molar ratio. Since melarsoprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% propylene glycol intravenous injection. To avoid the risk of injection site reactions, melarsoprol must be given slowly. Melarsoprol used for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis with CNS involvement is given under a complicated dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for children and adults is 2‚Äì3.6 mg/kg/day intravenously for three days, then repeated every seven days for a total of three series. To monitor for relapse, follow-up is recommended every six months for at least two years. Pharmacokinetics The half-life of melarsoprol is less than one hour, but bioassays indicate a 35-hour half-life. This is commonly associated with pharmacologic agents that have active metabolites. One such metabolite, Mel Ox, reaches maximum plasma levels about 15 minutes after melarsoprol injection. Melarsoprol clearance is 21.5 ml/min/kg and the Mel Ox half-life is approximately 3.9 hours. Society and culture Melarsoprol is produced by Sanofi-Aventis and under an agreement with the WHO, they donate melarsoprol to countries where the disease is common.

Stopping power contrasts with lethality in that it pertains only to a weapon's ability to make the target cease action, regardless of whether or not death ultimately occurs. Which ammunition cartridges have the greatest stopping power is a much debated topic. Stopping power is related to the physical properties and terminal behavior of the projectile (bullet, shots or slug), the biology of the target, and the wound location, but the issue is complicated and not easily studied. Although higher-caliber ammunitions usually have greater muzzle energy and momentum and thus traditionally been widely associated with higher stopping power, the physics involved are multifactorial, with caliber, muzzle velocity, bullet mass, bullet shape and bullet material all contributing. Despite much disagreement, the most popular theory of stopping power is that it is usually caused not by the force of the bullet but by the wounding effects of the bullet, which are typically a rapid loss of blood causing a circulatory failure, which leads to impaired motor function and/or unconsciousness. The \\"Big Hole School\\" and the principals of penetration and permanent tissue damage are in line with this way of thinking. The other prevailing theories focus more on the energy of the bullet and it's effects on the nervous system, including hydrostatic shock and energy transfer, which is similar to kinetic energy deposit. History The concept of stopping power appeared in the 19th Century when colonial troops (e.g. American in the Philippines during the 1899‚Äì1913 Moro Rebellion, British during the 1845‚Äì72 New Zealand Wars) at close quarters found that their pistols were not able to stop charging native tribesmen. This led to the introduction or reintroduction of larger caliber weapons (such as the older .45 Colt and the newly developed .45 ACP) capable of stopping opponents with a single round. During the Seymour Expedition in China, at one of the battles at Langfang, Chinese Boxers, armed with swords and spears, charged the British and Americans, who were armed with guns. At point-blank range, one British soldier had to fire four .303 Lee-Metford bullets into a Boxer before he ceased to be a threat. The American Captain Bowman McCalla reported that single rifle shots were not enough: multiple rifle shots were needed to halt a Boxer. Only machine guns were effective in immediately stopping the Boxers. In the Moro Rebellion, Moro Muslim Juramentados in suicide attacks continued to charge against American soldiers even after being shot. Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising had to be shot dozens of times before he died. This forced the Americans to phase out revolvers with .38 Long Colt caliber ammunition with Colt .45 Colt against the Moros. British troops used expanding bullets against native tribesmen in the Northwest Frontier of India, and in the Sudan (see The River War by Winston Churchill). Britain voted against a prohibition on their use at the Hague Convention of 1899, although the prohibition only applied to international warfare. In response to addressing stopping power issues, the Mozambique Drill was developed to maximize the likelihood of a target's quick incapacitation. \\"Manstopper\\" is an informal term used to refer to any combination of firearm and ammunition that can reliably incapacitate, or \\"stop\\", a human target immediately. For example, the .45 ACP pistol round and the .357 Magnum revolver round both have firm reputations as \\"manstoppers\\". Historically, one type of ammunition has had the specific tradename \\"Manstopper\\". Officially known as the Mk III cartridge, these were made to suit the British Webley .455 service revolver in the early 20th century. The ammunition used a cylindrical bullet with hemispherical depressions at both ends. The front acted as a hollow point deforming on impact while the base opened to seal the round in the barrel. It was introduced in 1898 for use against \\"savage foes\\",This refers to the potential of blocking a very brutal sudden assault, such as that of a huge feline (tigers). but fell quickly from favor due to concerns of breaching the Hague Convention's international laws on military ammunition, and was replaced in 1900 by re-issued Mk II pointed- bullet ammunition. Some sporting arms are also referred to as \\"stoppers\\" or \\"stopping rifles\\". These powerful arms are often used by game hunters (or their guides) for stopping a suddenly charging animal, like a buffalo or an elephant. Dynamics of bullets A bullet will destroy or damage any tissues which it penetrates, creating a wound channel. It will also cause nearby tissue to stretch and expand as it passes through tissue. These two effects are typically referred to as permanent cavity (the track left by the bullet as it penetrates flesh) and temporary cavity, which, as the name implies, is the temporary (instantaneous) displacement caused as the bullet travels through flesh, and is many times larger than the actual diameter of the bullet. These phenomena are unrelated to low-pressure cavitation in liquids. The degree to which permanent and temporary cavitation occur is dependent on the mass, diameter, material, design and velocity of the bullet. This is because bullets crush tissue, and do not cut it. A bullet constructed with a half diameter ogive designed meplat and hard, solid copper alloy material may crush only the tissue directly in front of the bullet. This type of bullet (monolithic-solid rifle bullet) is conducive to causing more temporary cavitation as the tissue flows around the bullet, resulting in a deep and narrow wound channel. A bullet constructed with a two diameter, hollow point ogive designed meplat and low-antimony lead-alloy core with a thin gilding metal jacket material will crush tissue in front and to the sides as the bullet expands. Due to the energy expended in bullet expansion, velocity is lost more quickly. This type of bullet (hollow-point hand gun bullet) is conducive to causing more permanent cavitation as the tissue is crushed and accelerated into other tissues by the bullet, causing a shorter and wider wound channel. The exception to this general rule is non-expanding bullets which are long relative to their diameter. These tend to destabilize and yaw (tumble) soon after impact, increasing both temporary and permanent cavitation. High velocity bullet fragmentation Bullets are constructed to behave in different ways, depending on the intended target. Different bullets are constructed variously to: not expand upon impact, expand upon impact at high velocity, expand upon impact, expand across a broad range of velocities, expand upon impact at low velocity, tumble upon impact, fragment upon impact, or disintegrate upon impact. To control the expansion of a bullet, meplat design and materials are engineered. The meplat designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; hollow pointed which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow punched hole in the end of a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze with tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight. Some bullets are constructed by bonding the lead core to the jacket to promote higher weight retention upon impact, causing a larger and deeper wound channel. Some bullets have a web in the center of the bullet to limit the expansion of the bullet while promoting penetration. Some bullets have dual cores to promote penetration. Bullets that might be considered to have stopping power for dangerous large game animals are usually 11.63 mm (.458 caliber) and larger, including 12-gauge shotgun slugs. These bullets are monolithic-solids; full metal jacketed and tungsten steel insert. They are constructed to hold up during close range, high velocity impacts. These bullets are expected to impact and penetrate, and transfer energy to the surrounding tissues and vital organs through the entire length of a game animal's body if need be. The stopping power of firearms when used against humans is a more complex subject, in part because many persons voluntarily cease hostile actions when shot; they either flee, surrender, or fall immediately. This is sometimes referred to as \\"psychological incapacitation\\". Physical incapacitation is primarily a matter of shot location; most persons who are shot in the head are immediately incapacitated, and most who are shot in the extremities are not, regardless of the firearm or ammunition involved. Shotguns will usually incapacitate with one shot to the torso, but rifles and especially handguns are less reliable, particularly those which do not meet the FBI's penetration standard, such as .25ACP, .32 S&W;, and rimfire models. More powerful handguns may or may not meet the standard, or may even overpenetrate, depending on what ammunition is used. Fully jacketed bullets penetrate deeply without much expansion, while soft or hollow point bullets create a wider, shallower wound channel. Pre-fragmented bullets such as Glaser Safety Slugs and MagSafe ammunition are designed to fragment into birdshot on impact with the target. This fragmentation is intended to create more trauma to the target, and also to reduce collateral damage caused from ricocheting or overpenetrating of the target and the surrounding environments such as walls. Fragmenting rounds have been shown to be unlikely to obtain deep penetration necessary to disrupt vital organs located at the back of a hostile human. Wounding effects=Physical Permanent and temporary cavitation cause very different biological effects. A hole through the heart will cause loss of pumping efficiency, loss of blood, and eventual cardiac arrest. A hole through the liver or lung will be similar, with the lung shot having the added effect of reducing blood oxygenation; these effects however are generally slower to arise than damage to the heart. A hole through the brain can cause instant unconsciousness and will likely kill the recipient. A hole through the spinal cord will instantly interrupt the nerve signals to and from some or all extremities, disabling the target and in many cases also resulting in death (as the nerve signals to and from the heart and lungs are interrupted by a shot high in the chest or to the neck). By contrast, a hole through an arm or leg which hits only muscle will cause a great deal of pain but is unlikely to be fatal, unless one of the large blood vessels (femoral or brachial arteries, for example) is also severed in the process. The effects of temporary cavitation are less well understood, due to a lack of a test material identical to living tissue. Studies on the effects of bullets typically are based on experiments using ballistic gelatin, in which temporary cavitation causes radial tears where the gelatin was stretched. Although such tears are visually engaging, some animal tissues (but not bone or liver) are more elastic than gelatin. In most cases, temporary cavitation is unlikely to cause anything more than a bruise. Some speculation states that nerve bundles can be damaged by temporary cavitation, creating a stun effect, but this has not been confirmed. One exception to this is when a very powerful temporary cavity intersects with the spine. In this case, the resulting blunt trauma can slam the vertebrae together hard enough to either sever the spinal cord, or damage it enough to knock out, stun, or paralyze the target. For instance, in the shootout between eight FBI agents and two bank robbers in the 1986 FBI Miami shootout, Special Agent Gordon McNeill was struck in the neck by a high- velocity .223 bullet fired by Michael Platt. While the bullet did not directly contact the spine, and the wound incurred was not ultimately fatal, the temporary cavitation was sufficient to render SA McNeill paralyzed for several hours. Temporary cavitation may similarly fracture the femur if it is narrowly missed by a bullet. Temporary cavitation can also cause the tearing of tissues if a very large amount of force is involved. The tensile strength of muscle ranges roughly from 1 to 4 MPa (145 to 580 lbf/in2), and minimal damage will result if the pressure exerted by the temporary cavitation is below this. Gelatin and other less elastic media have much lower tensile strengths, thus they exhibit more damage after being struck with the same amount of force. At typical handgun velocities, bullets will create temporary cavities with much less than 1 MPa of pressure, and thus are incapable of causing damage to elastic tissues that they do not directly contact. Rifle bullets that strike a major bone (such as a femur) can expend their entire energy into the surrounding tissue. The struck bone is commonly shattered at the point of impact. High velocity fragmentation can also increase the effect of temporary cavitation. The fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. The main mass of the bullet can then cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched. Whether a person or animal will be incapacitated (i.e. \\"stopped\\") when shot, depends on a large number of factors, including physical, physiological, and psychological effects. Neurological The only way to immediately incapacitate a person or animal is to damage or disrupt their central nervous system (CNS) to the point of paralysis, unconsciousness, or death. Bullets can achieve this directly or indirectly. If a bullet causes sufficient damage to the brain or spinal cord, immediate loss of consciousness or paralysis, respectively, can result. However, these targets are relatively small and mobile, making them extremely difficult to hit even under optimal circumstances. Bullets can indirectly disrupt the CNS by damaging the cardiovascular system so that it can no longer provide enough oxygen to the brain to sustain consciousness. This can be the result of bleeding from a perforation of a large blood vessel or blood-bearing organ, or the result of damage to the lungs or airway. If blood flow is completely cut off from the brain, a human still has enough oxygenated blood in their brain for 10‚Äì15 seconds of wilful action,Wound Ballistic Workshop: \\"9mm vs. .45 Auto\\", FBI Academy, Quantico, VA, September 1987. Conclusion of the Workshop. though with rapidly decreasing effectiveness as the victim begins to lose consciousness. Unless a bullet directly damages or disrupts the central nervous system, a person or animal will not be instantly and completely incapacitated by physiological damage. However, bullets can cause other disabling injuries that prevent specific actions (a person shot in the femur cannot run) and the physiological pain response from severe injuries will temporarily disable most individuals. Several scientific papers reveal ballistic pressure wave effects on wounding and incapacitation, including central nervous system injuries from hits to the thorax and extremities. These papers document remote wounding effects for both rifle and pistol levels of energy transfer. Recent work by Courtney and Courtney provides compelling support for the role of a ballistic pressure wave in creating remote neural effects leading to incapacitation and injury. This work builds upon the earlier works of Suneson et al. where the researchers implanted high-speed pressure transducers into the brain of pigs and demonstrated that a significant pressure wave reaches the brain of pigs shot in the thigh. These scientists observed neural damage in the brain caused by the distant effects of the ballistic pressure wave originating in the thigh. The results of Suneson et al. were confirmed and expanded upon by a later experiment in dogs which \\"confirmed that distant effect exists in the central nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity. A high-frequency oscillating pressure wave with large amplitude and short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a high-energy missile ...\\" Wang et al. observed significant damage in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus regions of the brain due to remote effects of the ballistic pressure wave. Psychological Emotional shock, terror, or surprise can cause a person to faint, surrender, or flee when shot or shot at. There are many documented instances where people have instantly dropped unconscious when the bullet only hit an extremity, or even completely missed. Additionally, the muzzle blast and flash from many firearms are substantial and can cause disorientation, dazzling, and stunning effects. Flashbangs (stun grenades) and other less-lethal \\"distraction devices\\" rely exclusively on these effects. Pain is another psychological factor, and can be enough to dissuade a person from continuing their actions. Temporary cavitation can emphasize the impact of a bullet, since the resulting tissue compression is identical to simple blunt force trauma. It is easier for someone to feel when they have been shot if there is considerable temporary cavitation, and this can contribute to either psychological factor of incapacitation. However, if a person is sufficiently enraged, determined, or intoxicated, they can simply shrug off the psychological effects of being shot. During the colonial era, when native tribesmen came into contact with firearms for the first time, there was no psychological conditioning that being shot could be fatal, and most colonial powers eventually sought to create more effective manstoppers. Therefore, such effects are not as reliable as physiological effects at stopping people. Animals will not faint or surrender if injured, though they may become frightened by the loud noise and pain of being shot, so psychological mechanisms are generally less effective against non-humans. Penetration According to Dr. Martin Fackler and the International Wound Ballistics Association (IWBA), between 12.5 and 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) of penetration in calibrated tissue simulant is optimal performance for a bullet which is meant to be used defensively, against a human adversary. They also believe that penetration is one of the most important factors when choosing a bullet (and that the number one factor is shot placement). If the bullet penetrates less than their guidelines, it is inadequate, and if it penetrates more, it is still satisfactory though not optimal. The FBI's penetration requirement is very similar at 12 to 18 inches (305 to 457 mm). A penetration depth of 12.5 to 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) may seem excessive, but a bullet sheds velocity‚Äîand crushes a narrower hole‚Äîas it penetrates deeper, so the bullet might be crushing a very small amount of tissue (simulating an \\"ice pick\\" injury) during its last two or three inches of travel, giving only between 9.5 and 12 inches of effective wide-area penetration. Also, skin is elastic and tough enough to cause a bullet to be retained in the body, even if the bullet had a relatively high velocity when it hit the skin. About 250 ft/s (76 m/s) velocity is required for an expanded hollow point bullet to puncture skin 50% of the time. The IWBA's and FBI's penetration guidelines are to ensure that the bullet can reach a vital structure from most angles, while retaining enough velocity to generate a large diameter hole through tissue. An extreme example where penetration would be important is if the bullet first had to enter and then exit an outstretched arm before impacting the torso. A bullet with low penetration might embed itself in the arm whereas a higher penetrating bullet would penetrate the arm then enter the thorax where it would have a chance of hitting a vital organ. Overpenetration Overpenetration of a projectile through a synthetic ordnance gelatin. Overpenetration occurs when a bullet passes through its intended target and out of the other side, with enough residual kinetic energy to continue flying and risk causing collateral damages to objects or persons beyond. This happens because the bullet has not released all its energy within the target, according to the energy transfer hypothesis. Other hypotheses These hypotheses are a matter of some debate among scientists in the field: Energy transfer The energy transfer hypothesis states that for small arms in general, the more energy transferred to the target, the greater the stopping power. It postulates that the pressure wave exerted on soft tissues by the bullet's temporary cavity hits the nervous system with a jolt of shock and pain and thereby forces incapacitation. Proponents of this theory contend that the incapacitation effect is similar to that seen in non-concussive blunt-force trauma events, such as a knock-out punch to the body, a football player \\"shaken up\\" as result of a hard tackle, or a hitter being struck by a fastball. Pain in general has an inhibitory and weakening effect on the body, causing a person under physical stress to take a seat or even collapse. The force put on the body by the temporary cavity is supersonic compression, like the lash of a whip. While the lash only affects a short line of tissue across the back of the victim, the temporary cavity affects a volume of tissue roughly the size and shape of a football. Giving further credence to this theory is the support from the aforementioned effects of drugs on incapacitation. Pain killers, alcohol, and PCP have all been known to decrease the effects of nociception and increase a person's resistance to incapacitation, all while having no effect on blood loss. Kinetic energy is a function of the bullet's mass and the square of its velocity. Generally speaking, it is the intention of the shooter to deliver an adequate amount of energy to the target via the projectiles. All else held equal, bullets that are light and fast tend to have more energy than those that are heavy and slow. Over-penetration is detrimental to stopping power in regards to energy. This is because a bullet that passes through the target does not transfer all of its energy to the target. Lighter bullets tend to have less penetration in soft tissue and therefore are less likely to over-penetrate. Expanding bullets and other tip variations can increase the friction of the bullet through soft tissue and stop over-penetration. Non-penetrating projectiles can also possess stopping power and give support to the energy transfer hypothesis. Notable examples of projectiles designed to deliver stopping power without target penetration are Flexible baton rounds (commonly known as \\"beanbag bullets\\") and the rubber bullet, types of reduced-lethality ammunition. The force exerted by a projectile upon tissue is equal to the bullet's local rate of kinetic energy loss, with distance \\\\mathrm{d}E_k/\\\\mathrm{d}x (the first derivative of the bullet's kinetic energy with respect to position). The ballistic pressure wave is proportional to this retarding force (Courtney and Courtney), and this retarding force is also the origin of both temporary cavitation and prompt damage (CE Peters). Hydrostatic shock Hydrostatic shock is a controversial theory of terminal ballistics that states a penetrating projectile (such as a bullet) can produce a sonic pressure wave that causes \\"remote neural damage\\", \\"subtle damage in neural tissues\\" and/or \\"rapid incapacitating effects\\" in living targets. Proponents of the theory contend that damage to the brain from hydrostatic shock from a shot to the chest occurs in humans with most rifle cartridges and some higher-velocity handgun cartridges. Hydrostatic shock is not the shock from the temporary cavity itself, but rather the sonic pressure wave that radiates away from its edges through static soft tissue. =Knockback= The idea of \\"knockback\\" implies that a bullet can have enough force to stop the forward motion of an attacker and physically knock them backwards or downwards. It follows from the law of conservation of momentum that no \\"knockback\\" could ever exceed the recoil felt by the shooter, and therefore has no use as a weapon. The myth of \\"knockback\\" has been spread through its confusion with the phrase \\"stopping power\\" as well as by many films, which show bodies flying backward after being shot. The idea of knockback was first widely expounded in ballistics discussions during American involvement in Philippine insurrections and, simultaneously, in British involvement in the Caribbean, when front-line reports stated that the .38 caliber revolvers carried by U.S. and British soldiers were incapable of bringing down a charging warrior. Thus, in the early 1900s, the U.S. reverted to the .45 Colt in single action revolvers, and later adopted the .45 ACP cartridge in what was to become the M1911A1 pistol, and the British adopted the .455 Webley caliber cartridge in the Webley Revolver. The larger cartridges were chosen largely due to the Big Hole Theory (a larger hole does more damage), but the common interpretation was that these were changes from a light, deeply penetrating bullet to a larger, heavier \\"manstopper\\" bullet. Though popularized in television and movies, and commonly referred to as \\"true stopping power\\" by uneducated proponents of large powerful calibers such as .44 Magnum, the effect of knockback from a handgun and indeed most personal weapons is largely a myth. The momentum of the so- called \\"manstopper\\" .45 ACP bullet is approximately that of a mass dropped from a height of .Momentum is different from kinetic energy; an equivalent kinetic energy [855 ft¬∑lbf (1159 J)] of a typical .45 ACP bullet is that of a 60 pound (27 kilogram) mass dropped from a height of 14 feet (4.3 meters) or that of a 57-mph baseball. Such a force is simply incapable of arresting a running target's forward momentum. In addition, bullets are designed to penetrate instead of strike a blunt force blow, because, in penetrating, more severe tissue damage is done. A bullet with sufficient energy to knock down an assailant, such as a high-speed rifle bullet, would be more likely to instead pass straight through, while not transferring the full energy (in fact only a very small percentage of the full energy) of the bullet to the victim. Sometimes \\"knockdown power\\" is a phrase used interchangeably with \\"knockback\\", while other times it's used interchangeably with \\"stopping power\\". The misuse and fluid meaning of these phrases have done their part in confusing the issue of stopping power. The ability of a bullet to \\"knock down\\" a metal or otherwise inanimate target falls under the category of momentum, as explained above, and has little correlation with stopping power. One-shot stop This hypothesis, promoted by Evan P. Marshall, is based on statistical analysis of actual shooting incidents from various reporting sources (typically police agencies). It is intended to be used as a unit of measurement and not as a tactical philosophy, as mistakenly believed by some. It considers the history of shooting incidents for a given factory ammunition load and compiles the percentage of \\"one-shot-stops\\" achieved with each specific ammunition load. That percentage is then intended to be used with other information to help predict the effectiveness of that load getting a \\"one-shot-stop\\". For example, if an ammunition load is used in 10 torso shootings, incapacitating all but two with one shot, the \\"one-shot-stop\\" percentage for the total sample would be 80%. Some argue that this hypothesis ignores any inherent selection bias. For example, high-velocity 9 mm hollow point rounds appear to have the highest percentage of one-shot stops. Rather than identifying this as an inherent property of the firearm/bullet combination, the situations where these have occurred need to be considered. The 9 mm has been the predominantly used caliber of many police departments, so many of these one-shot-stops were probably made by well-trained police officers, where accurate placement would be a contributory factor. However, Marshall's database of \\"one-shot-stops\\" does include shootings from law enforcement agencies, private citizens, and criminals alike. Critics of this theory point out that bullet placement is a very significant factor, but is only generally used in such one-shot-stop calculations, covering shots to the torso. Others contend that the importance of \\"one-shot stop\\" statistics is overstated, pointing out that most gun encounters do not involve a \\"shoot once and see how the target reacts\\" situation. Proponents contend that studying one-shot situations is the best way to compare cartridges as comparing a person shot once to a person shot twice does not maintain a control and has no value. Since 2006, after the conviction of retired school teacher Harold Fish in Arizona for second degree murder during a self-defense shooting, some CCW holders in the United States have elected to switch from carrying hollow-point bullets, and especially 10mm Auto caliber weapons with perceived higher one- shot stopping power, to carrying smaller caliber weapons. Fish's conviction for killing a homeless man with a history of dangerous violent behavior and mental instability who attacked Fish while hiking on a remote trail, was obtained through a jury trial by stressing that Fish overreacted, through choosing to use the increased stopping power of 10 mm hollow point bullets. State law in Arizona has subsequently been changed, such that the state now has the burden to prove that a self-defense shooting was not in self-defense, whereas the burden previously, before the Fish incident, was that the shooter on trial had to prove that the shooting was in fact, done in self-defense. The conviction has since been thrown out by the Arizona Court of Appeals. CCW training classes often advise the use of bullets that are identical to those used by local police, in type (FMJ or hollow point) and caliber, to prevent an overreaction prosecution. Big hole school This school of thought says that the bigger the hole in the target the higher the rate of bleed-out and thus the higher the rate of the aforementioned \\"one shot stop\\". According to this theory, as the bullet does not pass entirely through the body, it incorporates the energy transfer and the overpenetration ideals. Those that support this theory cite the .40 S&W; round, arguing that it has a better ballistic profile than the .45, and more stopping power than a 9√ó19mm Parabellum. The theory centers on the \\"permanent cavitation\\" element of a handgun wound. A big hole damages more tissue. It is therefore valid to a point, but penetration is also important, as a large bullet that does not penetrate will be less likely to strike vital blood vessels and blood-carrying organs such as the heart and liver, while a smaller bullet that penetrates deep enough to strike these organs or vessels will cause faster bleed-out through a smaller hole. The ideal may therefore be a combination; a large bullet that penetrates deeply, which can be achieved with a larger, slower non-expanding bullet, or a smaller, faster expanding bullet such as a hollow point. In the extreme, a heavier bullet (which preserves momentum greater than a lighter bullet of the same caliber) may \\"overpenetrate\\", passing completely through the target without expending all of its kinetic energy. So-called \\"overpenetration\\" is not an important consideration when it comes to wounding incapacitation or \\"stopping power\\", because: (a) while a lower proportion of the bullet's energy is transferred to the target, a higher absolute amount of energy is shed than in partial penetration, and (b) overpenetration creates an exit wound. Other contributing factors As mentioned earlier, there are many factors, such as drug and alcohol levels within the body, body mass index, mental illness, motivation levels, body part strike (e.g., \\"armpit hold\\") which may determine which round will kill or at least catastrophically affect a target during any given situation.

The clubs are able to keep prices low due to the no-frills format of the stores. In addition, customers may be required to pay annual membership fees in order to shop. Membership in a warehouse club superficially resembles that in a consumers' cooperative, but lacks key elements including cooperative ownership and democratic member control. The use of members' prices without cooperative ownership is also sometimes used in bars and casinos. History A BJ's Wholesale club in Virginia In 1971, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P;) opened their very first Warehouse Economy Outlet (WEO), a warehouse format that only lasted a few years. In 1976, Sol Price (who in 1954 founded FedMart, an early US discount store) and his son Robert Price founded Price Club in San Diego, as their first warehouse club. In 1982, the discount pioneer John Geisse founded The Wholesale Club of Indianapolis, which he sold to Sam's Club in 1991. In 1983, James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman opened the first Costco warehouse in Seattle. Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart. Also in 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations, after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with Sam's Club. Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies. The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16billion in annual sales. PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but in 1994, the Price brothers left the company to form Price Enterprises, a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco. In 1983, Kmart's Pace Membership Warehouse (later sold to Sam's Club) started operations. That same year, Sam Walton opened the first Sam's Club on April 7, in Midwest City, Oklahoma. In 1984, former The Wholesale Club executives founded BJ's Wholesale Club, owned by Zayre. In 1997, Costco changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded , the three largest warehouse club chains operating in the United States are BJs, Costco, and Sam's Club. BJ's Wholesale Club is one of the smaller competitors, with stores located primarily in the Eastern United States. Costco and Sam's Club are the largest chains. Costco has locations in seven other nations including Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, claims a membership base of 47 million persons and 602 stores across the United States (as of June 2019). On July 16, 2020, it has been announced that Price Club will be returning to San Diego with new locations. https://patch.com/california/san-diego/price-club-returning-san- diego-nodx Examples * BJ's Wholesale Club, operates in the U.S. only * City Club, operates in Mexico only * Costco, operates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the UK, Iceland, Australia, Spain, France, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan * Makro, operates in Europe, South Africa, Thailand and South America; previously operated in the U.S., Indonesia & the Philippines. * PriceSmart, operates in Central America and Caribbean; previously operated in Asia-Pacific region * S&R; Membership Shopping, operates in the Philippines only * Sam's Club, operates in the U.S., Mexico and other countries * Wholesale Club, operates in Canada only and Jamaica Defunct * American Wholesale Club (1986‚Äì1989) * Buyers Club, a Denver-based independently owned chain * Club Wholesale, turned into office supplies stores, then folded * Fedco, bankruptcy in 1999 (most stores were bought by Target Stores) * GEM & GEX Membership Department Stores (required membership like a warehouse club) * Gemco, 1959‚Äì1986, owned by Lucky Stores * HomeClub, a home improvement warehouse, later became HomeBase and then folded in 2000 * Max-Club, owned by SuperValu (United States) * PACE Membership Warehouse, owned by Kmart, merged with Sam's Club * Price Club, merged with Costco in 1993 * Price Savers Wholesale Club, merged with PACE Warehouse Club, then merged with Sam's Club * Sam's Club, in Canada 2003‚Äì2009 * SourceClub, owned by Meijer, from 1992 to 1994.

Theoretically, a bandwidth-limited signal can be perfectly reconstructed if sampled at the Nyquist rate or above it. The Nyquist rate is defined as twice the bandwidth of the signal. Oversampling is capable of improving resolution and signal-to- noise ratio, and can be helpful in avoiding aliasing and phase distortion by relaxing anti-aliasing filter performance requirements. A signal is said to be oversampled by a factor of N if it is sampled at N times the Nyquist rate. Motivation There are three main reasons for performing oversampling: Anti-aliasing Oversampling can make it easier to realize analog anti- aliasing filters. Without oversampling, it is very difficult to implement filters with the sharp cutoff necessary to maximize use of the available bandwidth without exceeding the Nyquist limit. By increasing the bandwidth of the sampling system, design constraints for the anti-aliasing filter may be relaxed. Once sampled, the signal can be digitally filtered and downsampled to the desired sampling frequency. In modern integrated circuit technology, the digital filter associated with this downsampling are easier to implement than a comparable analog filter required by a non-oversampled system. Resolution In practice, oversampling is implemented in order to reduce cost and improve performance of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) or digital-to-analog converter (DAC). When oversampling by a factor of N, the dynamic range also increases a factor of N because there are N times as many possible values for the sum. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases by \\\\sqrt{N}, because summing up uncorrelated noise increases its amplitude by \\\\sqrt{N}, while summing up a coherent signal increases its average by N. As a result, the SNR increases by \\\\sqrt{N}. For instance, to implement a 24-bit converter, it is sufficient to use a 20-bit converter that can run at 256 times the target sampling rate. Combining 256 consecutive 20-bit samples can increase the SNR by a factor of 16, effectively adding 4 bits to the resolution and producing a single sample with 24-bit resolution. The number of samples required to get n bits of additional data precision is :\\\\mbox{number of samples} = (2^n)^2 = 2^{2n}. To get the mean sample scaled up to an integer with n additional bits, the sum of 2^{2n} samples is divided by 2^n: :\\\\mbox{scaled mean} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sum\\\\limits^{2^{2n}-1}_{i=0} 2^n \\\\text{data}_i}{2^{2n}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits^{2^{2n}-1}_{i=0} \\\\text{data}_i}{2^n}. This averaging is only effective if the signal contains sufficient uncorrelated noise to be recorded by the ADC. If not, in the case of a stationary input signal, all 2^n samples would have the same value and the resulting average would be identical to this value; so in this case, oversampling would have made no improvement. In similar cases where the ADC records no noise and the input signal is changing over time, oversampling improves the result, but to an inconsistent and unpredictable extent. Adding some dithering noise to the input signal can actually improve the final result because the dither noise allows oversampling to work to improve resolution. In many practical applications, a small increase in noise is well worth a substantial increase in measurement resolution. In practice, the dithering noise can often be placed outside the frequency range of interest to the measurement, so that this noise can be subsequently filtered out in the digital domain‚Äîresulting in a final measurement, in the frequency range of interest, with both higher resolution and lower noise. Noise If multiple samples are taken of the same quantity with uncorrelated noise added to each sample, then because, as discussed above, uncorrelated signals combine more weakly than correlated ones, averaging N samples reduces the noise power by a factor of N. If, for example, we oversample by a factor of 4, the signal-to- noise ratio in terms of power improves by factor of 4 which corresponds to a factor of 2 improvement in terms of voltage. Certain kinds of ADCs known as delta-sigma converters produce disproportionately more quantization noise at higher frequencies. By running these converters at some multiple of the target sampling rate, and low-pass filtering the oversampled signal down to half the target sampling rate, a final result with less noise (over the entire band of the converter) can be obtained. Delta-sigma converters use a technique called noise shaping to move the quantization noise to the higher frequencies. Example Consider a signal with a bandwidth or highest frequency of B = 100 Hz. The sampling theorem states that sampling frequency would have to be greater than 200 Hz. Sampling at four times that rate requires a sampling frequency of 800 Hz. This gives the anti-aliasing filter a transition band of 300 Hz ((fs/2) ‚àí B = (800 Hz/2) ‚àí 100 Hz = 300 Hz) instead of 0 Hz if the sampling frequency was 200 Hz. Achieving an anti-aliasing filter with 0 Hz transition band is unrealistic whereas an anti-aliasing filter with a transition band of 300 Hz is not difficult. Reconstruction The term oversampling is also used to denote a process used in the reconstruction phase of digital-to-analog conversion, in which an intermediate high sampling rate is used between the digital input and the analogue output. Here, digital interpolation is used to add additional samples between recorded samples, thereby converting the data to a higher sample rate, a form of upsampling. When the resulting higher-rate samples are converted to analog, a less complex and less expensive analog reconstruction filter is required. Essentially, this is a way to shift some of the complexity of reconstruction from analog to the digital domain. Oversampling in the ADC can achieve some of the same benefits as using a higher sample rate at the DAC.

He made 380 appearances and scored 44 goals in the Football League and Premier League. He was an attacking left back who could also play further up the field or even as a winger and was a dead ball specialist. Career=Playing career An experienced player, his career started in 1989 at Colchester United, where he made 37 league starts between July 1992 and October 1993, before moving on to Brentford on 21 October for a fee of ¬£60,000. He was a first-team regular throughout his time at the club, making 100 league starts and scoring 12 goals. He joined Birmingham City on 25 March 1996, and quickly became an inspirational player due to his continued consistency and ability from set-pieces. He picked up the Player of the Season award for 1999‚Äì2000, and played for Birmingham in the 2001 Football League Cup Final loss to Liverpool, missing one of the spot kicks in the shootout. As Birmingham continued to improve in the First Division, and eventually earned promotion into the Premiership, Grainger's playing time became limited. He failed to appear for Birmingham due to injury during the first half of the 2003‚Äì04 season, and in February he was loaned to Coventry City, for whom he made seven league appearances. On 18 March 2004, he was recalled to Birmingham's team due to an injury crisis, and got on the scoresheet in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Manchester United, but was himself injured and failed to appear in any matches for the rest of the season. Grainger retired from football on 1 January 2005, having spent 13 years as a player. His goal-scoring appearance against Manchester United, on 10 April 2004, proved to be his final professional fixture. In the years following his retirement, Grainger has continued to be a popular figure amongst supporters of Birmingham City. Managerial career In January 2008, Grainger was appointed manager of Southern League Premier Division club Cheshunt, but left the post after less than a week. In their only game during his tenure, Cheshunt lost 4‚Äì0 to Hemel Hempstead Town. Personal life After leaving professional football, Grainger worked as a delivery driver and a chauffeur, and in 2015 was training to be a train driver. His son Charlie also became a professional footballer, playing as a goalkeeper. He joined Leyton Orient in 2009, turned professional in 2014, and has represented England at under-18 level.

He was a skillful all-rounder, being a right arm bowler and right- handed batsman.  Background  Born Unaarrimin (he was given the name 'Mullagh' to identify him with his place of birth), a member of the Jardwadjali people, on Mullagh Station, about sixteen kilometres north of Harrow, Victoria, Mullagh learned to play cricket at the Edgar's Pine Hills agricultural property in Harrow. He was given the name \\"Black Johnny\\" to distinguish him from a \\"White Johnny\\".  Cricketing career  Mullagh played 47 matches on the 1868 England tour, scoring 1698 runs at an average of around 20 on pitches that were often treacherous.Johnny Mullagh, CricInfo. Retrieved 2018-03-06. He also bowled 1877 overs, 831 of which were maidens, and took 245 wickets at 10 apiece. If this wasn't enough, he would occasionally don wicket- keeping gloves, achieving four stumpings. Nineteenth-century Australia witnessed severe discrimination against indigenous peoples. Many of those chosen to tour England were left to obscure futures and early deaths once the venture had concluded. One player, King Cole, died on the trip and of those who returned, seven spent time on a reserve, two vanished and the fate of two others is not clear from the surviving records. \\"Few contemporary cricketers better merited the title of all-rounder\\", according to the historian D. J. Mulvaney. Mullagh's performances were impressive enough for him to join the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) as a professional for party of the 1869-70 season. His appointment was terminated shortly afterwards, reportedly because of a severe illness when he was on the verge of inter-colonial selection. In 1870 Mullagh first played in a match for the Western District, appearing for Apsley against Harrow, but for the rest of his career he played mostly for Harrow. Mullagh was both an independent person and a passionate advocate of indigenous rights, refusing to dwell on state-controlled reserves. His political stance was revealed during a game at Apsley, when, as the players went to lunch, a white participant asked, \\"What about the nigger?\\" The captain replied, \\"Let him have his dinner in the kitchen; Mullagh refused to eat in the kitchen, and sat outside the hotel in protest. Mullagh never appeared in inter-colonial cricket although he did represent Victoria against a touring England side in 1879, top scoring with 36 in the second innings. He was then 38 years old, and instead of going in first-wicket-down as he did for his club, batted at nine and 10. Maintaining his independence and dignity to the end, Mullagh spent his last days living in a rabbitter's shack. He continued to play cricket until a few months before his death at Pine Hills Station in 1891, one day after his 50th birthday. The Hamilton Spectator described him in his obituary as \\"the [W.G.] Grace of aboriginal cricketers\\", while another writer referred to Mullagh as \\"Victoria's premier batsman\\".Old 'un, \\"An Old Time Team of Darkies\\", Euroa Advertiser, 2 April 1897, p. 3.  Legacy  A memorial was built to honour Mullagh in Harrow, Victoria where the local sports ground is Johnny Mullagh Oval and a local indigenous tournament created to vie for the Johnny Mullagh Memorial Trophy. In February 2012, the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Jeanette Powell, announced Mullagh as one of the 20 inaugural inductees to the Victorian Indigenous Honour Roll. Cricket Australia announced plans for a medal to be awarded to the best player of the Boxing Day Test match, named in honour of Johnny Mullagh.

It is often seen in lupus erythematosus but is not pathognomonic - it is also seen in other diseases such as pellagra, dermatomyositis, and Bloom syndrome. While some literature has described the slapped-cheek rash of fifth disease as a malar rash, it differs slightly in that the nose is typically spared. The malar rash of lupus is red or purplish and mildly scaly. Characteristically, it has the shape of a butterfly and involves the bridge of the nose. Notably, the rash spares the nasolabial folds of the face, which contributes to its characteristic appearance. It is usually macular with sharp edges and not itchy. The rash can be transient or progressive with involvement of other parts of the facial skin. A malar rash is present in approximately 46‚Äì65% of people with lupus and varies between different populations. There are numerous other conditions which can cause rashes with a similar appearance. Where lupus is suspected, further medical tests (usually an ANA as a screening test which is not specific for systemic lupus erythematosus) and a detailed history and examination are necessary to differentiate it from other conditions.

In the serial, the ancient evil force Fenric uses the vampiric Haemovores, the descendants of humanity from the future, to attack a World War II naval base in England and orders them to destroy life on Earth by poisoning it with chemicals. Unusually, two further versions of this story exist: the 1991 video release incorporated about six minutes of extra material into the original narrative, and the 2003 DVD included a 'Special Edition' edited into a single movie- length feature, with new special effects, re-editing of some scenes, and 12 minutes of unbroadcast footage. Plot The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive at a British naval installation near Maiden's Point on the Northumberland coast during World War II. Befriending the base personnel, they learn that the base, run by Commander Millington, is being used as a listening post to intercept and translate German coded messages using the Ultima supercomputer and to stockpile a supply of a lethal nerve gas. Meanwhile, wheelchair-user Dr. Judson has also been using Ultima to help decipher Viking runes found in catacombs beneath the base, warning of a being called Fenric, which has attracted Millington's attention, he believing that he can gain Fenric's power. Outside the base, the Doctor and Ace discover a covert squad of Soviet commandos, led by Captain Sorin, who are seeking to capture Ultima; the Doctor warns them to lie low, while Ace and Sorin become smitten with each other. A Haemovore, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience The Doctor and Ace find a glowing oriental vase, a treasure captured by the Vikings and left in the catacombs, but it is taken by Millington when they return to the base. As Millington and Judson prepare to use Ultima to decipher the writings on the vase, vampire-like Haemovores begin to emerge from the sea, attack and convert the English and Soviet troops and other residents into more Haemovores. When Judson runs Ultima with the vase, energy strikes him and he becomes infused with Fenric. Fenric begins to give orders to the Ancient One, an old Haemovore in control of the other monsters, to continue to assault anyone in their path and to destroy all humans by poisoning the Earth with chemicals at the installation. Ace is able to warn one of the WRNS, Kathleen, in time for her to escape with her newborn child, Audrey. The Doctor reveals he has faced Fenric, an ancient evil since the dawn of time, besting him by challenging him at a chess problem. Arranging another chess problem in the same room where the nerve gas has been stockpiled, the Doctor is able to delay Fenric, while he runs off to seek a more permanent solution. Sorin, the last remaining member of his squad, enters the room and prepares to shoot Fenric, but Fenric reveals that Sorin is one of his \\"wolves\\", having descended from the Vikings that carried the cursed vase to the English shores and takes over his body. When Ace returns to the room, she unwittingly helps Fenric, in Sorin's body, to solve the chess problem. The Doctor arrives too late, as Fenric can no longer be stopped. Fenric orders the Ancient One to attack the Doctor but a psychic barrier created by Ace's trust in the Doctor prevents the Ancient One from acting. The Doctor is forced to reveal to Ace that she too is one of Fenric's pawns, as it was he that created the time storm that transported her to the alien colony Iceworld. Furthermore, by saving Kathleen and Audrey, she has assured that the cycle remain unbroken, as Audrey will grow up to become Ace's mother whom she despises. Ace's faith is shattered, causing the psychic barrier to drop but, instead of attacking the Doctor, the Ancient One grabs Fenric, pulls him into a sealed chamber and releases a lethal dose of the gas. The chamber explodes, killing them both. As the Doctor and Ace recover along the shore, Ace takes a moment to contemplate why she hates her mother and to celebrate overcoming her irrational fear of the water, before she and the Doctor return to the TARDIS. Continuity The Doctor chants the names of his former companions to ward off the Haemovores. Most of the names he chants are inaudible, but a few can be made out, including Susan, Barbara, Vicki and Steven, all companions of the First Doctor. Ace mentions an old house in Perivale. This was originally intended as a foreshadowing of Ghost Light; the resequencing of the broadcast schedule, however, altered it into an apparent reference to a past story. Similarly, the Doctor's new wardrobe for season 26 was hidden throughout part one by a long duffel coat, setting up a dramatic revelation when he removed the coat. Sylvester McCoy, however, has stated that he was given the coat to shelter from the cold weather on location, and was permitted to retain it on-screen. Production=Pre-production Writer Ian Briggs based the character of Dr Judson on Alan Turing. In an interview for the DVD release of this story, Briggs said that since at that time it was not considered appropriate to depict a character's struggle with homosexuality in a family programme, he transformed Turing's frustration at being unable to express his true sexual identity into Judson's frustration at being disabled. In the same interview, Briggs stated that he intended to suggest that both Judson and Millington were gay and had a shared past, although this was not realised in the finished programme. This story was originally going to be titled The Wolves of Fenric (and before that, Wolf-Time). Fenric does refer to his servants as his \\"wolves\\" (and wolves play a strong role in Norse mythology, especially the monster Fenrir). However, Nathan-Turner felt that as the \\"wolves\\" connection was not revealed until quite late in the story, the title would not initially make sense to the audience. Although there are several references in the story to the Norse belief in a final battle at the end of the world, the word Ragnarok was removed from the script to avoid confusion with the Gods of Ragnarok from the previous season's The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. This story is the second in what some have called the \\"Ace Trilogy\\", a three-story arc that explores elements of Ace's past before she met the Doctor. This was not an intentional trilogy, since Fenric was originally intended to start the season. Fenric was moved to third in the season because its horror themes were seen as more fitting for airing in October. Production The Curse of Fenric was originally to have been shot, as with most Doctor Who serials, as a mixture of studio interiors and location exteriors. However, after reading the script, director Nicholas Mallett persuaded producer John Nathan-Turner that given the settings involved, the serial could be made more effective and realistic by shooting the entire production on location, to which Nathan-Turner eventually agreed. Shooting on the serial went over-length to such a degree that consideration was briefly given to editing the story into five rather than four episodes. However, Ian Briggs strongly opposed this, feeling that the narrative flow would be badly disrupted. The exact setting of the story is disputed as either Northumberland or near Whitby, North Yorkshire, although Reverend Wainwright's mention of Dracula coming ashore there indicates the latter. The scenes set in the fictional location of Maiden's Point were shot on location at Lulworth Cove in Dorset. The production also visited Kent and filmed at Lillesden Manor which doubled as the laboratory under the church, Roses Farm in Hawkhurst, which doubled as Mrs Hardaker's Cottage and St Lawrence Church in Hawkhurst which doubled as St Judd's Church.

Henfrey returned to the series as Mrs. Pitt in the Twelfth Doctor episode \\"Mummy on the Orient Express\\". * Sylvia Syms was originally offered the part of Miss Hardaker but played the character Mrs Pritchard in another story of the season, Ghost Light. Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping described the serial as \\"something special\\" with \\"many magical scenes\\" in The Discontinuity Guide (1995).\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the direction and horror. In 2012, Mark Braxton of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five. He wrote that there was \\"much to enjoy and admire\\" and suggested it as an influence on the revived Doctor Who in terms of companions. However, he felt that it was \\"as if three scripts have been rewritten as one\\", considering the plot was too convoluted and observing that the special effects were \\"a mixed bag\\". Christopher Bahn, reviewing the serial for The A.V. Club, also commented on its influence on the modern series, but felt it hadn't \\"aged well visually\\" and \\"often looks cheap and feels cheesy, but the way it takes chances and stretches the boundaries of what Doctor Who was about is admirable, even if that might have been too- little-too-late for a show that would be off the air in two months.\\" He also believed it \\"starts strongly and has some terrific moments, but gets convoluted and confusing toward the finale.\\" He criticised the \\"less-than- graceful dialogue\\" and special effects, and felt that Fenric and the Haemavores lacked sufficient background. Commercial releases=In print A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Briggs, was published by Target Books in November 1990. The novel features additional character information absent from the serial and an epilogue featuring an older Ace after she has left the Doctor. This formed part of the basis for Ace's departure in Kate Orman's Virgin New Adventures novel Set Piece, where she chooses to stay in Paris to monitor a time rift and at some point has a relationship with one of Captain Sorin's ancestors. Home media The Curse of Fenric was released on VHS in 1991. The release included about six minutes' worth of the extra scenes. This story was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in October 2003 in a two-disc set as part of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary Celebration releases. This consisted of the original four broadcast episodes, with an additional DVD commentary recorded by Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred and Nicholas Parsons, plus a 'Special Edition' edited into one movie-length adventure including 12 minutes of unbroadcast material. This version has reworked special effects and music arranged by Mark Ayres based on notes written up by himself and the late Nicholas Mallett; it also sees several scenes re-edited to produce a more coherent narrative. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 39 on 30 June 2010.

She is known for her long-standing role as a panelist on the television game show What's My Line?, on which she regularly appeared for 25 years, from 1950-1975 on both the network and syndicated versions of the show. Early life Francis was born on October 20, 1907, in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Leah (n√©e Davis) and Aram Kazanjian. Her Armenian father was studying art in Paris at the age of 16 when he learned that both his parents had died in one of the massacres perpetrated by the Turkish government in Turkey between 1894 and 1896, known as the Hamidian Massacres.Francis, Arlene, with Florence Rome, pp. 4‚Äì5. He immigrated to the United States and became a portrait photographer, opening his own studio in Boston in the early 20th century. Later in life, Kazanjian painted canvases of dogwoods, \\"rabbits in flight\\", and other nature scenes, selling them at auction in New York.Francis, Arlene, with Florence Rome, pp. 11‚Äì13. When Francis was seven years old, her father decided that opportunities were greater in New York and moved the family to a flat in Washington Heights, Manhattan.Francis, Arlene, with Florence Rome (1978), p. 14. She remained a New York resident until she entered a San Francisco nursing home in 1993. Career Arlene Francis, circa 1950 After attending Finch College, Francis began a varied career as an entertainer based in New York City. She became an accomplished stage actress, performing in many local theatre and off-Broadway plays, and compiling 25 Broadway plays to her credit through 1975. In 1932, she made her film debut in Universal's Murders in the Rue Morgue. She appeared in films sporadically until the 1970s. Francis became a well-known New York City radio personality, hosting several programs. In 1938 she became the female host of the radio game show What's My Name?; although several men appeared as co-hosts over the years, Francis was the sole female host throughout the program's long run (on ABC, NBC and Mutual networks) until it ended in 1949. In 1940, Francis played Betty in Betty and Bob, an early radio soap opera broadcast. In 1943, she began as host of a network radio game show, Blind Date, which she hosted also on ABC and NBC television from 1949‚Äì52. She was a regular contributor to NBC Radio's Monitor in the 1950s and 1960s, and hosted a long-running midday chat show on WOR-AM that ran from 1960 to 1984. The What's My Line? panel in 1952. From left: Dorothy Kilgallen, Bennett Cerf, Arlene Francis, and Hal Block; newscaster John Daly was host of the show. Francis (left) with Cerf, Kilgallen, and Daly on What's My Line? in 1965. Francis was a panelist on the weekly game show What's My Line? from its second episode on CBS in 1950 until its network cancellation in 1967, and in its daily syndicated version from 1968‚Äì75. The original show, which featured guests whose occupation, or \\"line,\\" the panelists were to guess, became one of the classic television game shows, noted for the urbanity of its host and panelists. She appeared on other game shows, including Match Game, Password, To Tell the Truth, and other programs produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, including a short-lived hosting stint on Goodson-Todman show By Popular Demand replacing original host Robert Alda. According to TV Guide, Francis was the highest-earning game show panelist in the 1950s, making $1000 (equal to $ today) per show on the prime time version of What's My Line? By contrast, the second-highest paid panelists on TV, Dorothy Kilgallen and Faye Emerson, received $500 (equal to $ today) per appearance.TV Guide January 8‚Äì14, 1954 page 6. Retrieved February 21, 2017 Francis was the emcee on the last episodes of the short-lived The Comeback Story, a 1954 reality show on ABC in which mostly celebrities shared stories of having overcome adversities in their personal lives. Francis was a pioneer for women on television, one of the first to host a program that was not musical or dramatic in nature. From 1954-57, she was host and editor-in-chief of Home, NBC's hour-long daytime magazine program oriented toward women, which was conceived by network president Pat Weaver to complement the network's Today and Tonight programs. Newsweek put her on its cover as the \\"first lady of television\\". She hosted Talent Patrol in the mid-1950s. She acted in a few Hollywood films, debuting in the role of a streetwalker who falls prey to mad scientist Bela Lugosi in Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932). In her memoir, Francis said she was cast for the movie even though her only acting experience at the time was in a small Shakespearean production in a convent school she had attended. Some sixteen years later, she appeared in the film version of Arthur Miller's play, All My Sons (1948) with Edward G. Robinson. In the 1960s Francis made three films: she played the wife of James Cagney in One, Two, Three (1961), directed by Billy Wilder and filmed in Munich. She made The Thrill of It All (1963) with James Garner and, in 1968, the television version of the play Laura, which she had played on stage several times. Her final film performance was in Wilder's Fedora (1978). She wrote an autobiography in 1978 entitled Arlene Francis: A Memoir with help from longtime friend Florence Rome. She wrote That Certain Something: The Magic of Charm in 1960 and a cookbook, No Time for Cooking, in 1961. She was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1980-82. Francis also guested on television programs, including Mrs. G. Goes to College in 1962 in the episode \\"The Mother Affair\\". Personal life Francis was married twice. Her first marriage, from 1935 to 1945, was to Neil Agnew, an executive of Paramount Pictures; they divorced in 1945. She wrote of this experience in her 1978 autobiography: > Having made the actual physical break, it was easier for me than I had > thought to explain to Neil some of what I felt, what I had been feeling for > so long a time. Not all, of course. There were areas which I couldn't > discuss even then, which would be too hurtful to him, I felt. I saw him > fairly often, and he courted me as though we had just met, but I was > building up strengths which enabled me to resist not only his blandishments > (including a lovely little house which he bought in New York as an > enticement to get me to change my mind) but those of my parents, who also > would have given anything to see me go back to the status which had been > quo. Francis's second marriage was to actor and producer Martin Gabel, from 1946 until his death in 1986. Gabel was a frequent guest panelist on What's My Line? The couple, who often exchanged endearments on the show, had a son, Peter Gabel, born January 28, 1947, a legal scholar associated with New College of California in San Francisco. Peter Gabel was an associate editor of Tikkun, a Jewish community, commentary magazine. While working as a tour guide at the 1964 New York World's Fair, Peter surprised his mother as a contestant on What's My Line?YouTube; retrieved July 29, 2013. Francis and her husband settled a lawsuit for $185,000 in June 1962 that had been filed by the widow of a Detroit man who was killed when a dumbbell fell from the Gabel family‚Äôs eighth-floor Ritz Tower apartment and struck him on the head while he was visiting New York for medical treatment. Francis, Gabel and their son Peter were vacationing in Connecticut when the 1960 incident happened. Francis had instructed their maid to shampoo the carpet while they were away. The maid kept windows open for a long time to minimize the smell of the shampoo. The dumbbell was part of the equipment that Francis used for her regular exercise of weightlifting. On May 26, 1963, Francis was involved in a serious car accident while driving alone from a theater on Long Island to the Manhattan studio where she was expected for a live telecast of What's My Line?. The force from a car that struck her car caused her to skid on the wet surface of the Northern State Parkway, jump the highway's concrete divider and collide with a car containing five passengers, one of whom was killed. Francis suffered a broken collarbone, a concussion and many cuts and bruises. Francis was known for wearing a heart-shaped diamond pendant, a gift from Gabel, which she wore on nearly all of her What's My Line appearances. A mugger robbed her of the pendant as she was leaving a New York City taxi in 1988. Death Francis died at the age of 93 on May 31, 2001 in San Francisco, California from Alzheimer's disease and cancer. She was interred in Roosevelt Memorial Park in Trevose, Pennsylvania.

His exploits propelled him to local fame and infamy, with his name briefly adorning the village that would one day become Minnesota's capital city.  History  Sources disagree about Parrant's exact history before settling in the Minnesota Territory, but most indicate that he was of French Canadian origin (or perhaps M√©tis) and born near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, around 1777. For most of his adult life Parrant made his living as a fur trapper while working for a company called McKenzie and Chouteau. During his days as a fur trapper \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant, so called because he was blind in one eye, started to gain a somewhat dubious reputation with law enforcement, most likely due to his dabbling as a bootlegger. With the onset of age and the fur trade's decline Parrant began seeking new endeavors to earn a living. His search brought him to a fledgling new settlement near a military outpost called Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory.  Pierre Parrant in Minnesota  Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant, namesake of Pig's Eye Beer Arriving at Mendota in 1832, Parrant began to carve out a new life for himself while residing in a squatter's colony near Fort Snelling. His new career found him distilling liquor, which he sold to other squatters, the indigenous people of the area, and even the soldiers at the fort. This new business served \\"Pig's Eye\\" (French: L'≈íil de Cochon) until 1838, when the squatters were forced off the land surrounding the fort due to their strain on surrounding resources. It was at this time that the 60+-year-old Parrant made a claim on a tract of land at the entrance of what was known as Fountain Cave. This cave was situated on the east bank of the Mississippi River just upstream from what is now Downtown Saint Paul. Then, around June 1, 1838, Parrant completed a small shack that, according to an 1892 publication by Albert A. Jones, became \\"the first habitation, and the first business house of Saint Paul.\\" Thus Parrant became the first inhabitant of the future city of Saint Paul. That such a distinction belongs to a man with Parrant's reputation has irked some historians, such as J. Fletcher Williams, who lamented: > Such was the man on whom Fortune, with that blind fatuity that seems to > characterize the jade, thrust the honor of being the founder of our good > city! Our pride almost revolts at the chronicling of such a humiliation, and > leads us to wish that it were on one worthier and nobler that such a > distinction had fallen. But history is inexorable, and we must record facts > as they are. Fountain Cave, site of the first saloon in Saint Paul, Minnesota, operated by Pierre \\"Pig's Eye\\" Parrant Fountain Cave was an excellent location for Parrant's claim, as the spring inside it provided a steady water supply for his still. It was at Fountain Cave that Parrant opened a tavern that became wildly popular with the surrounding community. The bar, known as \\"Pig's Eye\\" or \\"Pig's Eye Pandemonium\\", was easily accessible to local residents, riverboat crews working on the river, and the soldiers from nearby Fort Snelling. Parrant had become so popular, in fact, that when a nearby resident named Joseph R. Brown sent a letter to a friend in 1839 he gave the return address simply as \\"Pig's Eye.\\" Not long after, Brown received correspondence at the address he had given. As a result, the growing community around Pierre's bar became known as \\"Pig's Eye.\\" The city's name might have remained Pig's Eye had it not been for the arrival of a Catholic priest named Lucien Galtier. So aghast was Galtier that the village on the river derived its name from a man of such ill repute that, when he built his small chapel in the area in 1841, he reportedly stated, \\"Pig's Eye, converted thou shalt be, like Saul; Arise, and be, henceforth, Saint Paul!\\" It is disputed whether Galtier actually said those words, but the story is part of the city's folklore. In 1844, Parrant lost his claim at Fountain Cave and was forced to vacate the land. It is not clear why. Some sources indicate that he was involved in a border dispute with a neighbor; others say he was forced to sell his claim because of mounting debts.  Life after Saint Paul  What happened to Parrant after he left Saint Paul is mysterious. Some sources say he was so upset about losing his claim that he decided to leave the Minnesota area and return to Sault Ste. Marie, only to die along the way in 1844. Others say he eventually settled near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where he died between 1872 and 1886. The latter account is unlikely since it would mean he lived to be 100, which was extremely rare at that time.

Biography Altschul, having initially taught himself to play drums, studied with Charlie Persip during the 1960s. In the latter part of the decade, he performed with Paul Bley. In 1969 he joined with Chick Corea, Dave Holland and Anthony Braxton to form the group Circle. At the time, he made use of a high- pitched Gretsch kit with add-on drums and percussion instruments. In the 1970s, Altschul worked extensively with Anthony Braxton's quartet featuring Kenny Wheeler, Dave Holland, and George Lewis. Braxton, signed to Arista Records, was able to secure a large enough budget to tour with a collection of dozens of percussion instruments, strings and winds. In addition to his participation in ensembles featuring avant-garde musicians, Altschul performed with Lee Konitz, Art Pepper and other \\"straight ahead\\" jazz performers. Altschul also made albums as a leader, but after the mid-1980s he was rarely seen in concert or on record, spending much of his time in Europe. Since the 2000s, he has become more visible, with two sideman appearances on the CIMP label with the FAB trio (with Billy Bang and Joe Fonda), the Jon Irabagon Trio recording \\"Foxy\\", and the bassist Adam Lane. Altschul has played or recorded with many musicians, including Roswell Rudd, Dave Liebman, Barre Phillips, Denis Levaillant, Andrew Hill, Sonny Criss, Hampton Hawes, and Lee Konitz.

He is known as a co-author of the paper which presented the Bailey‚ÄìBorwein‚ÄìPlouffe algorithm (discovered by Simon Plouffe) for computing œÄ. First interest in mathematics Borwein was born into a Jewish family. He became interested in number theory and classical analysis during his second year of university. He had not previously been interested in math, although his father was the head of the University of Western Ontario's mathematics department and his mother is associate dean of medicine there. Borwein and his two siblings majored in mathematics. Academic career After completing a Bachelor of Science in Honours Math at the University of Western Ontario in 1974, he went on to complete an MSc and Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia. He joined the Department of Mathematics at Dalhousie University. While he was there, he, his brother Jonathan Borwein and David H. Bailey of NASA wrote the 1989 paper that showed a proof for computing one billion digits of œÄ. They won the 1993 Chauvenet Prize and Hasse Prize. In 1993, he moved to Simon Fraser University, joining his brother Jonathan in establishing the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics (CECM) where he developed the Inverse Symbolic Calculator.  Research  In 1995, the Borweins collaborated with Yasumasa Kanada of the University of Tokyo to compute œÄ to more than four billion digits. Borwein has developed an algorithm that applies Chebyshev polynomials to the Dirichlet eta function to produce a very rapidly convergent series suitable for high precision numerical calculations, which he published on the occasion of the awarding of an honorary doctorate to his brother, Jonathan. Peter Borwein also collaborated with NASA's David Bailey and the Universit√© du Qu√©bec's Simon Plouffe to calculate the individual hexadecimal digits of œÄ. This provided a way for mathematicians to determine the nth digit of œÄ without calculating preceding digits. In 2007 with Tam√°s Erd√©lyi, Ronald Ferguson, and Richard Lockhart he settled Littlewood's Problem 22.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 11, 1993. The plot revolves around Homer Simpson becoming president of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's trade union and leading the workers of the plant in a strike in order to restore their dental plan so that he does not have to buy braces for Lisa. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode contains several cultural references and Dr. Joyce Brothers guest stars as herself. \\"Last Exit to Springfield\\" received widespread acclaim from both fans and critics and has frequently been cited as one of the best episodes of the entire series. Plot Mr. Burns sits in his office awaiting the arrival of Chuckie Fitzhugh, the leader of the Springfield chapter of the \\"International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians\\" trade union, who has mysteriously disappeared after promising to clean up the union. While perusing Fitzhugh's proposed contract, Burns becomes disgusted with its demands and reminisces about simpler times in which disgruntled workers were simply walled up in coke ovens. Burns then decides to challenge the union by arbitrarily revoking their proposed dental plan. Meanwhile, at Painless Dentistry, the Simpson children are getting their teeth checked. It is discovered Lisa needs braces. When Marge informs Homer, he tells her not to worry, as the dental plan the union had won during a previous strike will cover the cost. Later, at a union meeting, Carl announces that the newest contract requires them to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer, much to the surprise of Homer, who slowly comprehends that giving up their dental plan would require him to pay for Lisa's braces and jumps into action, reminding everyone how their dental plan has helped them all. Carl proposes that Homer be the new union president and he is promptly elected by a nearly unanimous vote. Burns watches Homer on his hidden camera, and is intimidated by his energy. Burns invites Homer to his office with the intent of bribing him, but Homer misconstrues Mr. Burns' sly innuendos as sexual advances. Homer declares that he is not interested in \\"backdoor shenanigans\\" and promptly leaves, which Burns misinterprets for Homer being honest and incorruptible. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson house in order to take Homer back to his manor to negotiate. While Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the restroom. Homer asks Burns where the restroom is and leaves, but his delayed attempts to find it lead Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Burns. The union misinterprets his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded. Later, Burns and Smithers march to a secret room in the Power Plant and turn off the power for the entire town. The strikers do not lose hope and begin to sing. Burns, confident he has broken the union's spirit, steps out on his balcony to hear their reaction but is disarmed by their unity and optimism. Burns finally calls a meeting with Homer to concede to their demands on one condition: that Homer resign as union president. Homer celebrates madly, leading Burns to finally realize that Homer is not the \\"brilliant tactician\\" he thought he was. With the Simpson family insured again, Lisa gets her perfect new braces and she, the Simpson family, and the dentist gather and laugh due to the room filling with nitrous oxide.\\"Last Exit to Springfield\\" The Simpsons.com. Retrieved on February 13, 2007 Production The idea for this episode came from Mike Reiss, who thought it would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. During the production of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny. The producers originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood to provide the voice of the dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be O. J. Simpson, but he turned it down, much to the relief of the writers when Simpson was later tried for murder. Cultural references Yellow Submarine'. Everything in the sequence had to be slightly changed for copyright reasons. The title of the episode is an homage to Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, one subplot of which involves the corruption and downfall of a union leader during a strike. The body of the union president, Chuckie Fitzhugh, is seen buried under a football field, an homage to the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa and his alleged burial at New Jersey's Giants Stadium. Mr. Burns' outfit in the flashback to his childhood is based on Buster Brown. Homer's imagination of a life of organized crime is based on Don Fanucci's first appearance in The Godfather Part II, accepting donuts rather than a necklace and an orange. Lisa has a nitrous oxide-induced hallucination that echoes The Beatles film Yellow Submarine, which Al Jean says had to be changed slightly for legal reasons. This included changing the name of the short sequence to \\"purple submersible\\"; Paul McCartney calls her \\"Lisa in the Sky\\", while George Harrison notes \\"no diamonds though\\". The scene where Lisa acquires her monstrous braces, laughs maniacally and breaks her mirror is based on a scene from the 1989 Tim Burton film Batman where Jack Napier discovers his transformation into the Joker. When Homer is escorted by the hired goons into what appears to be Burns' conservatory, a Burns-headed bird (presumably a vulture) is sitting in front of the screen, which then flies away. This is a reference to the cockatoo in Citizen Kane. The episode features an incidental music, a sample of \\"Classical Gas\\" by Mason Williams played by Lisa on a request from Lenny. The sequence of Mr. Burns and Smithers going through multiple doors to get to the main power switch, and the music accompanying it, is a parody of the opening credits of Get Smart. Before Mr. Burns shuts off the power to the town in response to the strike, he says, \\"From Hell's heart I stab at thee\\" which is a reference to Captain Ahab's curse, from the novel Moby-Dick. The workers' resistance to the power outage, and Mr. Burns's response, is a parody of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Last Exit to Springfield\\" finished 19th in ratings for the week of March 8‚Äì14, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.7, equivalent to approximately 12.8 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. This episode is generally ranked as being one of the best of all time and is on a number of Top 10 lists; the BBC stated it is \\"frequently cited as the show's best-ever episode\\". An Entertainment Weekly article from January 2003 looking back at the top 25 episodes of the series chose this episode as the show's greatest episode, saying \\"this episode is virtually flawless, the product of a series at the height of its creative powers -- when the satire was savage and relevant\\" and \\"the stuff of syndication legend: Burns facing down brilliant labor kingpin Homer Simpson; Homer Simpson facing down his own brain (DENTAL PLAN!/Lisa needs braces!); Grampa rattling on about wearing onions on his belt. Last Exit is a glorious symphony of the high and the low, of satirical shots at unions.\\" In 2020, Al Jean acknowledged \\"Last Exit to Springfield\\" as an episode many consider to be a favorite. In his book, Planet Simpson, Chris Turner calls it the best episode of the series, saying \\"Episode 9F15 of The Simpsons should be taught in schools, in history, economics, social studies, literature and art class. It's flawless\\". He also called it \\"the funniest half-hour in TV history\\", and provided a full analysis of the episode, only criticizing the chalkboard and couch gags. He maintains that he chose the episode as best ever before Entertainment Weeklys list was published. In 2003, to celebrate the show's 300th episode, USA Today published a top 10 chosen by the webmaster of The Simpsons Archive, which had this episode in first place. The BBC website says, \\"This fine episode contains several of our favourite sequences ... A classic, and the series' most marked expedition into the surreal - up to this point.\\" MSNBC, who listed the episode as their favorite, stated, \\"This is the episode that every self-respecting Simpsons geek must be able to recite verbatim.\\" Michael Moran of The Times ranked the episode as the sixth-best in the show's history. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the fourth season and the second greatest episode of The Simpsons (behind \\"Homer's Enemy\\"). Director Mark Kirkland considers this episode to be one of the most surreal episodes that he has worked on because it has a lot of story crammed into it, many parodies and contains several visual sequences. Al Jean has also called this one of the \\"craziest\\" episodes. Homer's line \\"uh... Yeah\\" after being asked if he found the bathroom is one of Jay Kogen's favorite Simpsons jokes. The episode's parody of Batman was named the 30th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film. Legacy The scene in the episode in which Mr. Burns shows his room with a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters, a reference to the infinite monkey theorem, has inspired a real-life experiment about the theorem. The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to \\"examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show\\", and to figure out what it is \\"trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies.\\" Throughout the episode, Lisa is seen playing a guitar and singing alongside the power plant workers. The song, named Union Strike Folk Song and originally written by Jeff Martin, has been adapted and sung for actual protests in Argentina in 2017, particularly during a controversy between employees from the Clar√≠n Group and CEO H√©ctor Magnetto.

The song was later released as the B-side of the US single \\"Nowhere Man\\", and then as the tenth track on the North America-only album Yesterday and Today. It is the only song by the band credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney‚ÄìStarkey. The song reached number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1966. Composition The original version of the song was written by John Lennon in the Quarrymen days and considered as a follow-up to \\"Please Please Me\\" in early 1963. A demo of this version featuring Lennon and Paul McCartney was recorded in 1963, but the song was not used until 1965 as Ringo Starr's vocal piece for Rubber Soul.\\"Unreleased 1963 Beatles Demo Up for Sale on eBay: Listen to a Snippet\\" . Steve Marinucci. billboard.com. September 21, 2017. According to Lennon, \\"it was resurrected with a middle eight thrown in, probably with Paul's help\\" for Rubber Soul. Barry Miles also claimed that McCartney and Starr combined for the middle eight. There is no formal middle eight in the song, though one chorus and one verse are extended; Ian MacDonald believes those longer sections were written by McCartney. Starr contributed to the lyrics, his first-ever composing credit on a Beatles song. However, when asked what his contribution was to the song, Starr jokingly stated, \\"About five words, and I haven't done a thing since.\\" The first pressing of the single accidentally omitted \\"Starkey\\" in the songwriting credit. Recording An early version was considered as a follow-up to \\"Please Please Me\\", and the Beatles hoped to record it on 5 March 1963, but there was only time for the other songs recorded that night: \\"From Me to You\\", \\"Thank You Girl\\", and an early version of \\"One After 909\\". The Rubber Soul version was recorded in one take, with overdubs, on 4 November 1965. In the verse before the lead break after Starr sings \\"tell me why,\\" Lennon can be heard saying \\"We already told you why!\\" in reference to the Beatles' \\"Tell Me Why\\" from A Hard Day's Night. During this session the Beatles recorded a long (6:36) instrumental tune called \\"12-Bar Original\\" for lack of a better name. \\"12-Bar Original\\" was not included on Rubber Soul, and was not commercially available until 1996 when an edited version of take 2 of this song was included on the Anthology 2 album.

Revoluci√≥n\\" (Disco Libre)  Early years  Brown's father was an American naval officer and his mother a native of Puerto Rico. Brown was raised during turbulent times in the United States. Among the important issues of those days were racism, the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. Most of these events went on to form an important part in his ideals and his way of thinking. In the late-1960s, Brown enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico. He enjoyed writing poems and while he was a student, he became actively involved in groups against the Vietnam War, poor living conditions, and specially in favor of the independence movement of Puerto Rico. Brown was also involved in the student disturbances which spread throughout the university, by participating in the protest and picket lines.  First Recordings  During this period he recorded two albums, Yo Protesto (1970) and Basta Ya... Revoluci√≥n. During that decade he also recorded: Roy Brown III, La Profec√≠a de Urayo√°n and Distancias. Brown's personal life started to suffer because of his political beliefs. He got into trouble with the police, his father and brother didn't want anything to do with him and he was fired from his job in the university. His mother was also dying. In the late-1970s, Brown moved to New York City and formed a group called Aires Bucaneros, with fellow musicians Zoraida Santiago, Carl Royce, Pablo Nieves, and Rucco Gand√≠a, among others. The group traveled and performed in many countries such as Greece, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, Cuba, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. He recorded Aires Bucaneros (1979), Casi Alba (1980), Nuyol (1983), √Årboles (1987) and Balada de Otro Tiempo (1989). Arboles was produced by Silvio Rodr√≠guez, in Cuba.  Return To Puerto Rico  In 1988, Brown returned to Puerto Rico and held a concert at the University of Puerto Rico which completely sold out. The first time he held a concert alone at the same place in the 1970s, only thirteen people showed up. Among Brown's recordings in the 1990s were: Distancias en Vivo (1990), Nocturno (1991), Poetas Puertorrique√±os (1992), and En Fuga (1995). In 1996, he released a two-disc album called Colecci√≥n (1996) containing the best of his musical trajectory through the Puerto Rican music scene. In 1997, Silvio Rodr√≠guez visited Puerto Rico and held a concert with Brown at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, with a soldout audience of 19,000 people. Recording with Zoraida Santiago In 2000 Brown reunited with his Aires Bucaneros partner, Zoraida Santiago. Together they released the album, Bohemia. Showing signs of musical growth, Roy continued to release quality albums in the late-1990s and early-2000s with Poeta en San Juan (1999), Noche de Roy Brown (1999), Album (2000) and Balcon del Fin del Mundo (2004). On June 7, 2003, Brown let WPKN FM of Bridgeport, Connecticut record his set in the historic Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n in Lares, Puerto Rico. WPKN also recorded Roy's \\"Ofelia\\" live from the Nuyorican Cafe in Old San Juan. On February 8, 2004, Brown held a concert in the Antonio Paoli Hall at the Luis A. Ferr√© Center of the Fine Arts in San Juan to celebrate his 35 years of music trajectory and the shows were all sold-out. Brown performs regularly in the Claridad festival, honoring Claridad, a Puerto Rican newspaper which advocates independence. Joan Manuel Serrat, Susana Baca, Fiel a la Vega, Cultura Prof√©tica, Celia Cruz and Lucecita Ben√≠tez are among the many artists that have recorded songs written by Roy Brown Ram√≠rez. Recent events In 2006 Brown recorded an album, titled Que Vaya Bien, with Tao Rodr√≠guez-Seeger from The Mammals and Tito Auger, the frontman for Puerto Rican rock group Fiel A La Vega. A single from this record, \\"El Banquete de Los S√°nchez\\" (whose lyrics were based on an essay by Puerto Rican writer Luis Rafael S√°nchez), was censored by some Puerto Rican radio stations due to the use of the slang term \\"chicho\\" (a love handle in Puerto Rican Spanish, but erroneously interpreted in this case as a verb tense for the slang term for sexual intercourse, \\"chichar\\"). Public backlash against the censorship attempt guaranteed radio airplay and good sales for the record (reportedly 30,000 copies in two months) during late 2006. After marrying Puerto Rican former tennis player Emilie Viqueira, Brown moved to Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico (Viqueira's birthplace), where he currently resides.

The River Line is a rail corridor located between Jersey City, New Jersey and Selkirk, New York, running along the west side of the Hudson Palisades and after passing through a tunnel at Haverstraw, New York, along the west bank of the Hudson River. A parallel track, which was operated as part of the River Line from Jersey City to Weehawken, New Jersey, was known as the Weehawken Branch. The River Line has since been split into several sections, following the 1999 division of Conrail assets between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation. The current name for this line is now CSX River Subdivision. The section south of CP 2 at CSX's North Bergen Yard is now owned by New Jersey Transit and used as part of the Hudson- Bergen Light Rail. CSX owns the remainder of the line. The section from CP 2 north to CP 7, a point in Bogota, New Jersey, was the Bergen Subdivision and incorporated into the River Subdivision. At CP 2, the former Bergen Subdivision connects to the ex-Conrail Northern Branch, which now carries trains that had used the River Line south of CP 2. At Selkirk, the River Subdivision ends at the Castleton Subdivision, with the Port Subdivision continuing towards Albany. The Castleton Sub was built as part of a bypass for through trains around Albany. Conrail's defunct River Line and Weehawken Branch The River Line ran at the foot of the Bergen Hill parallel to the Hudson River until the former Weehawken Terminal where it veered west under the Hudson Palisades through a tunnel to North Bergen Yard. The River Line began at CP Waldo, at a junction with the Passaic and Harsimus Line (P&H;). The P&H; Line runs west through what was the Pennsylvania Railroad's Bergen Hill Cut, just north of PATH, through a re-aligned Marion Junction. At CP Nave, the River Line junctioned with the National Docks Secondary, which still runs south on the east side of the Hudson Palisades, with the Nave-Croxton Running Track running west through the old Erie Railroad's Long Dock Tunnel. The junction only allowed trains coming to/from the south on the National Docks to continue to/from the north on the River Line. North of CP Nave, the River Line entered Hoboken; it is now used for the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) north of this point. The HBLR runs around the west and north sides of Hoboken and into Weehawken, where it turns west through a tunnel to CSX's North Bergen Yard, originally part of the New York Central's West Shore Railroad. From that point north, the River Line is still in use, but as CSX as the River Subdivision, north towards Albany, New York. The Weehawken Branch was just east of the River Line, from somewhere in Jersey City north of CP Nave to Baldwin Avenue in Weehawken. It was operated by Conrail as a second track of the River Line. The River Line was abandoned east and south of the Tonnelle Avenue overpass at the North Bergen yard. The short connection between the National Docks Secondary and the River Line was also abandoned, as was the Weehawken Branch. History The first bit of the River Line, splitting from the P&H; Line and passing over the National Docks, was built fairly recently as a connecting track. North of there, the line was the New Jersey Junction Railroad to the Weehawken tunnel. Through the tunnel, it was the West Shore Railroad. Both of these lines were owned by the New York Central Railroad. The Weehawken Branch was built and owned by the Erie Railroad. It originally passed through the middle of Hoboken, but was later realigned to the west side, right next to the New Jersey Junction Railroad.

The mission of BHSEC is to provide an academically rigorous liberal arts and sciences program that emphasizes thinking through writing, discussion, and inquiry. This alternative to the traditional high school is founded on the belief that many young people are ready and eager to do serious college work at age sixteen. Based on the premise that these young adults‚Äô ambition to learn must be taken seriously, the BHSEC model allows highly motivated, scholastically strong and intellectually curious students to begin their college studies two years early, graduating with a Bard College Associate in Arts degree in addition to their high school diploma. Students complete their high school studies in the ninth and tenth grade, after which point they begin taking credit-bearing college courses under the same roof. Unlike some dual-enrollment programs, students stay on the same campus for all four years, and both high school- and college-level courses are taught by the same faculty. Teachers at the Bard High School Early Colleges are both certified public school teachers as well as experienced academic scholars, often holding terminal degrees in their areas of study. The original campus, Bard High School Early College Manhattan, opened in New York City in 2001 as a partnership between Bard College and various local public school systems. There are currently six Bard High School Early College campuses across the country: BHSEC Manhattan, which opened in 2001, is located in the Lower East Side, Manhattan; BHSEC Queens, which opened in 2008, is located in Long Island City; BHSEC Newark, which opened 2011, is located in Newark, New Jersey; BHSEC Cleveland and BHSEC Cleveland East, which opened in 2014 and 2017, respectively, are located in Cleveland, Ohio; and BHSEC Baltimore, which opened in 2015, is located in Baltimore, Maryland. The Bard High School Early Colleges are part of a larger network of Bard College-run early college programs, called the Bard Early Colleges, which also include half-day programs in New Orleans, Louisiana; in partnership with the Harlem Children's Zone in New York City; and in Hudson, New York. Admissions BHSEC's admissions processes are extremely competitive, having an overall acceptance rate of 2.5%. Applicants are required to sit for a special BHSEC-only entrance exam. Based on their performance from the exam, and the school's own academic requirements, students are called for one on one interviews. As of 2020, there were 40 applicants per seat. All of the Bard High School Early Colleges are tuition-free, public high schools. Each campus has its own admissions practices, but all employ an open-ended writing assessment and an in-person interview. Admissions guidelines for each campus can be found on the schools' websites. Exam preparation for the assessment is also not available. History Founded in 2001 as a partnership of the New York City Department of Education and Bard College and funded in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bard High School Early College Manhattan was the first public Bard Early College. However, the early college model and many of the teaching philosophies employed across the Bard Early Colleges were primarily developed at Bard College at Simon's Rock, the oldest early college entrance program and only accredited four-year early college to date. BHSEC Manhattan was the first school in the Gates Foundation's Early College High School Initiative, which aims to improve education, in the United States, by introducing smaller public high schools which help remove the barriers to a college education by offering students a college education in a high school setting. As of June 2016, over 2,500 A.A. degrees have been awarded across all BHSEC campuses. The schools boast a 98% high school graduation rate and a 95% A.A. degree attainment rate. Many graduates of BHSEC transfer their 60+ college credits to another college or university and finish their Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in two more years; others opt to study for three or four years in their subsequent institutions. According to the National Student Clearinghouse, the six-year B.A. attainment rate for the classes of 2005-2009 was 98%. School structure=High school (9th & 10th grades) In the BHSEC program, students spend what is traditionally ninth and tenth grade finishing the bulk of their high school work. Students are encouraged to take all required state testing by the end of 10th grade, when possible ‚Äì in New York City, students take the five Regents exams required for the High School Regents diploma, which they receive in addition to the Associates of Arts degree from Bard College. Unlike most public high schools, however, BHSEC does not offer courses tailored to prepare students for state tests, nor are there any Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses offered (as the last two years are already spent in an accredited college program). In order to complete the high school curriculum in two years, courses are taught at an accelerated pace. BHSEC does not rank its students and does not honor titles such as Valedictorian, nor does it implement a Dean's list. Early College Program (11th & 12th grades) The two years spent, in the college program, are denoted \\"Year 1\\" and \\"Year 2.\\" As a college program, students may select their courses based primarily on their academic interests and preferences for certain professors; however, they must also meet the college program's core requirements. These requirements include four semesters of the Bard Seminar, in which students read and discuss seminal works of western thought, from Plato and the classics through Shakespeare and ending in postmodernism. Students are also required to complete two semesters of math, two semesters of laboratory science, one semester of a U.S. history course, one semester of a world history course, two semesters of literature, and two semesters of a foreign language (at least one at intermediate level) and three arts credits. Students may also create their own courses with the independent study program, provided that a faculty member is knowledgeable in the subject, awarding 1 to 3 credits, depending on the amount of college-level reading completed. Every semester, a student must take 14-18 credits. With permission from the dean, students may take more than 18 credits in a semester. Students can also transfer credits from other universities to meet their requirements for the college program. BHSEC's college program offers classes that are more specialized than in the high school program, such as linear algebra, reason and politics, novels of Dostoyevsky, philosophy of religion, physics of sound and music, the social contract and its critics, criminal law through literature, and culture and history of food. These courses are taught by college professors, many of whom have published books and articles in their fields. Across campuses, college course offering are based on the interest and expertise of the faculty members.  Writing and Thinking Workshop  Across all of Bard College's campuses and programs, the school year begins with a week-long Writing and Thinking Workshop. Students spend each day engaging in critical reading, writing, and thinking exercises, which are employed in the classroom throughout the school year. It is an opportunity to introduce new students to and re-familiarize current students with BHSEC's academic environment. Across disciplines, teaching at the Bard Early Colleges employs practices developed at the Bard Institute for Writing and Thinking to advance the philosophy that ‚ÄúWriting is both a record of completed thought and an exploratory process that supports teaching and learning across disciplines. At all levels writing allows the writer to discover what she or he wants to say.‚Äù Students and their teachers write together using various classroom exercises and teaching methods to respond to texts reflecting diverse genres, voices, and perspectives. This written dialog then becomes the basis for classroom discussion.

Islamic Relief offices and partners A 2018 map of where Islamic Relief works Controversies In June 2014, Israel added Islamic Relief to a list of organisations banned from operating in Israel, for allegedly funding Hamas. The charity's West Bank offices were raided and their computers were destroyed, files were confiscated, and an office safe was forcibly opened.. In late 2014, Islamic Relief claimed that an audit carried out by an unnamed \\"leading global audit firm\\" found no evidence of any link to terrorism. The Israeli government responded by claiming its decision to declare Islamic Relief illegal was \\"based on information that has been accumulated over years, that the fund is a central player in financing of Hamas\\". The organisation has challenged the decision in the Israeli courts. Subsequently, on 15 November 2014, the United Arab Emirates placed Islamic Relief on a list of proscribed organisations due to alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.Price, Matthew (2014-12-12). \\"Audit 'clears Islamic Relief' of terror funding claim\\".

The organisation denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood citing the organisation's neutral stance and humanitarian nature. In 2016, it was reported that the banking group HSBC decided to sever ties with Islamic Relief over concerns that \\"cash meant for humanitarian aid could potentially end up with terrorist groups abroad\\". HSBC invited Islamic Relief to \\"end the relationship\\", which the bank did in any case at the end of 2014, as it has with other aid and civil society organisations.

Times of Israel. Islamic Relief refutes these allegations and continues its work across Bangladesh, where it has been present for over 25 years. In 2019 the German government allege they have \\"significant personal ties\\" with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was strongly denied by Islamic Relief. In July 2020, Islamic Relief's director Heshmat Khalifa resigned after The Times discovered he had made antisemitic remarks on his Facebook page in 2014 and 2015.

There are, however, several regional differences.  The New Zealand experience  New Zealand is a country that is isolated from much of the rest of the world geographically, culturally, socially and gastronomically. New Zealanders are predominantly of European ancestry, although there exists a notable number of Asians and Polynesians, including indigenous MƒÅori. It is perhaps not surprising that these two situations lead to a humour that often has as a basis the newcomer trying to assimilate themselves with the new country. The intermingled strands of MƒÅori, British, mainland European, Polynesian, and Asian that have made the country their home each look at the land and each other in a different way, and these differences are often the focal point of humour. Comedians from minority groups (such as Raybon Kan and Jacob Rajan) often use these differences in their routines. New Zealand's remote and agricultural nature is also a regular comedy catalyst, especially the well-known ratio between people and sheep in the country. The pioneering, backwoods spirit is also commonly used in comedy, as in the stereotypical farmer, Fred Dagg,Wit & humour, John Clarke, NZ Listener, 1‚Äì7 August 2009 and the yarns spun by New Zealand writer Barry Crump. Urban/suburban themes were explored by Ginette McDonald with her Lynn of Tawa persona.  The trans-Tasman rivalry  Australians are the butt of Kiwi humour (and vice versa) ‚Äî even at the highest diplomatic level. During the 1980s, then‚ÄìPrime Minister of New Zealand Rob Muldoon was asked about the increasing exodus of New Zealanders leaving the country to work in Australia. His comment was that by doing so, they were raising the average IQ of both countries.\\"Migration to Australia\\", Te Ara\\"Ditching the big brother thing\\", Bruce Munro, 10 Feb 2013, ODT The joke derives from the Will Rogers phenomenon. In general terms, Australians are stereotyped in New Zealand humour as being brash, boorish and lazy. New Zealanders, in return, are seen by Australians as being behind the times and mocked as \\"South Seas Poms\\" on account of their supposedly closer ties with Britain ('Pom' is a slang word for 'British person', which is used by New Zealanders and Australians). Sheep jokes There are a large number of (mainly crude) sheep jokes. As befitting the trans-Tasman rivalry, Australians tell said jokes about New Zealanders, and New Zealanders tell them about Australians. In the UK on the other hand sheep jokes are usually reserved for the Welsh, or within Scotland in reference to people from Aberdeen. Some sheep jokes also take differences in the accent into account. In one example, a farmer who is having unnatural relations with a sheep is asked if he should rather be shearing the sheep, to which he replies \\"I'm not ' s-h-e-a-r-i-n-g ' this sheep with anyone!\\" Here shearing is taken have the same pronunciation as sharing, as it does in New Zealand English. Other sheep jokes (or \\"ewe-phemisms\\") include puns on song titles which contain the word ewe. For example, a performing band may announce they are playing the song \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\", and follow up by saying that it is particularly bad news for any Australians in the audience. While other people make jokes about New Zealanders and sheep, New Zealanders themselves are not averse to a bit of sheep humour. In mid-2000, Grant Gillon, then a New Zealand Member of Parliament, caused controversy when he asked the following question during a debate on genetic engineering: > \\"I want to ask the minister whether, no pun intended, it's appropriate in > this case for a woman's body parts to be inserted into a sheep when that has > normally been the domain of Tory males?\\" Commonly used insults that Australians use are the terms \\"Sheep-shagger\\" & \\"Ram-Rooter\\". Accents The difference between the accents of the two countries is a constant source of amusement. New Zealanders and Australians gain a great deal of enjoyment out of the perceived similarity between the others' pronunciation of the words 'six' and 'sex'. New Zealanders also often mock Australians by speaking the Australian accent in a stereotypically Steve Irwin fashion. Australians also often poke fun at New Zealanders' pronunciation of the words \\"fish and chips\\" becoming \\"fush en chups\\".  Regional humour  Many regional stereotypes have arisen over the years and jokes are told about other regions based on these stereotypes.  Auckland  Auckland is New Zealand's largest city and Aucklanders are regarded by many as boorish and insular. Aucklanders are often referred to as JAFAs or \\"Just Another Fucking Aucklander\\" and jokes are made about their out-of-touch, soft, city lifestyle and Nouveau riche practices, such as inappropriate use of Pajeros and other 4x4s exclusively on city streets. This tendency is not helped by the perception of Aucklanders not believing that civilization exists south of the Bombay Hills. During and after the 1998 Auckland power crisis there were many jokes made about it: * Q: If there are power shortages, which will you keep running, the cappuccino machine or the air conditioner? A: Both. * Q: What did Aucklanders use before they had candles? A: Electricity.  Wellington  Wellington, NZ's capital city, is in the Roaring Forties and has geography that intensifies the effects of the prevailing winds leading to its nickname \\"Windy Wellington\\". Other New Zealanders making jokes about Wellington concentrate on this aspect. Wellingtonians make jokes about the wind too, with one example being the Wellington Blown Away sign on the hill by the airport.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/7361432/Finally-Wellington-gets-the- sign Comedians  Some of New Zealand's best known comedians spent a large portion of their careers in Australia. This included John Clarke, known to New Zealanders as Fred Dagg, who played the stereotypical farmer with precision and style. His wit later allowed him to extend his repertoire to a series of biting satires, particularly of politicians. He also found an outlet in television series such as The Games and films such as Death in Brunswick. Other examples include Tony Martin of 1980s sketch show, The D-Generation fame. Three compilations of the Australian national radio program Martin/Molloy earned him ARIA awards. He has also written and directed the movie Bad Eggs. Pamela Stephenson was born in New Zealand, made her name in Australia, went to Britain and starred in the sketch comedy Not the Nine O'Clock News and currently lives in America with her husband Billy Connolly. However it was Billy T James who was to dominate New Zealand comedy through the 1980s. His first major role being the lead in TVNZ's Radio Times. James went on to gain his own self-titled show. Loved and hated for his irreverent portrayal of Maori, his characters, along with John Clarke's Fred Dagg were, until very recently, to set the benchmark for New Zealand comedy. Alan Brough appeared on Spicks and Specks as a writer and team captain. In 2004 he was one third of the radio show Tough Love with Mick Molloy. He has also appeared in several movies such as Bad Eggs For several years during the 1970s and 1980s, New Zealand television featured a satirical send-up of current affairs entitled A Week of It. This series, and particularly its two main stars, David McPhail and Jon Gadsby, became for several years a mainstay of New Zealand comedy. One of New Zealand film director Peter Jackson's first films was Meet the Feebles, a riotous sexual puppet romp. Some more recent New Zealand comedians worthy of mention are: *Rhys Darby, stand-up comedian most notorious for his portrayal of Flight of the Conchords manager 'Murray'. *Raybon Kan, former journalist and lawyer turned comedian. *Cal Wilson, appearing on Thank God You're Here several times and performing at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival numerous times. Her career in Australia extended to a regular drive-time radio show and weekly coverage of Australian Idol. *Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement form the partnership Flight of the Conchords, their work including the HBO television series, which followed \\"the trials and tribulations of a two-man, digi-folk band from New Zealand as they try to make a name for themselves in their adopted home of New York City\\". *Taika Waititi (also known as Taika Cohen), Academy Award nominated film director and stand- up comedian. *Jarred Christmas is an ex-pat New Zealand comic, who makes his living in the United Kingdom. He does much work with the BBC, and won the Chortle comedy award for Best Compere. *Madeleine Sami is a Fijian Indian/Irish comedian from Auckland.

It was founded in 1973 by University of California, Santa Barbara alumni Doug Otto and Karl F. Lopker. In 1975, the company was incorporated in California under the name Deckers Corporation. In October 1993, Deckers initiated a public offering of stock in its company. Deckers portfolio of brands includes: UGG, Teva, Sanuk, Hoka One One and Koolaburra. Deckers Brands products are sold in more than 50 countries and territories through select department and specialty stores, 138 Company-owned and operated retail stores, and select online stores, including Company-owned websites. History=Milestones Some key milestones include: In 1973, Karl Lopker began his career making and selling flip-flops at craft fairs along the West Coast of the United States. In 1975, Doug Otto visited Hawaii on business and found that locals referred to his sandals as \\"deckas\\", a slang word based on their striped layered construction that resembled a \\"deck\\" of stacked wood. Liking the name, Lopker and Otto named the brand Deckers. In 1985, Deckers expanded its range of sandals when it entered into a licensing agreement to produce and distribute Teva sandals. In 1993, Otto renamed his company Deckers Outdoor Corporation when it went public on the NASDAQ, and Deckers purchased Simple Shoes. In 1995, Deckers purchased UGG Holdings. In 2002, Deckers purchased Teva's patents, trademarks, and other assets. In 2003, Decker's UGG boots became well known after Oprah Winfrey included the boots on The Oprah Winfrey Show's Favorite Things segment. In 2010, Deckers acquired MOZO Shoes, a brand that produced footwear for the culinary industry. In 2011, Deckers acquired Sanuk shoes. In 2012, Deckers acquired Hoka One One.

A pair of Teva sport sandals Geophysicist Mark Thatcher invented Teva (, pronounced \\"teh-vah\\" not \\"tee-vah,\\" Hebrew for \\"nature\\"). While working as a rafting guide in 1982 he noticed the lack of proper shoes for river activities. Sneakers would become heavy when wet and would take days to dry, and flip-flops would slide off feet very easily. Thatcher added a nylon ankle strap to a traditional thong-style sandal, thus creating the first sports sandal. Thatcher patented his invention and signed an agreement with the shoemaker California Pacific to manufacture the shoes, while he marketed the \\"amphibious utility sandals\\" as their salesman, selling 200 pairs the first year. Although it was effective water sports footwear, it proved less effective for regular sports, as the first Teva users often complained of blisters between the first and second toes caused by the thong- style strapping system. However, in 1984 a sudden high demand of Teva sandals arose as young Americans found the sandal fashionable. California Pacific then claimed rights over the Teva name and patent, stating that Thatcher was merely an employee of their company. Thatcher sued California Pacific and won his case the following year, severing links with California Pacific. He then started the Tevas company in Flagstaff, Arizona. In late 1985, Thatcher set up an exclusive licensing agreement with Deckers Corporation to manufacture and distribute Teva sandals. Deckers eventually obtained exclusive rights to Teva, including US patent #4,793,075 for the basic design and a trademark for the brand name. The sandal was redesigned, creating the Universal Strapping System. The first model, called \\"Hurricane\\", is the basis of all Teva sandals. On November 25, 2002, Deckers Outdoor Cooperation acquired the worldwide Teva patents, trademarks, and other assets from Mark Thatcher. Teva sandals are currently manufactured in China and Vietnam. Construction The basic model consists of a 2-layer sole: *The inner sole is softer and serves as the footbed, and most of the models come with arch support and Microban Zinc, a technology that reduces odor and kills bacteria. *The outer sole is harder and is formulated to have a good grip on wet surfaces. The Universal strapping system consists of 3 parts: *The toe post: a strap that goes on the front of the sandal, across the toes and between the inner and outer sole. *The heel strap: Goes around the ankle to prevent the sandal from sliding off. *The side strap: Connects the toes post and the heel strap on the outer side of the sandal, this prevents the sandal from stretching in awkward positions where injury could occur. Each strap is connected to the others by triangular \\"rings\\"; each strap goes around one side of the ring. UGG Australia UGG brand boots, known as UGG Australia in Australia and New Zealand, have a sheepskin upper with a wool inner lining and a tanned outer surface worn by men and women. Surfing helped popularize the boots outside of Australia and New Zealand, when surfer Brian Smith started selling the boots in the US through UGG Holdings, Inc. in 1979. Impact of the UGG brand on performance Deckers is considered a niche market supplier due to the dominance of the brand boots, a fashion luxury item, in its sales, and as such the company is more reliant than traditional clothing manufacturers on its products remaining fashionable.Deckers Outdoor 10-K 2010 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Deckers Outdoor Form 10-K In the economic downturn of 2008, Deckers continued to show earnings and sales growth. In 2010, UGG boots were Deckers' primary source of revenue, accounting for 77% of net sales and 80% of the company's revenue. In 2012, Deckers raised prices on its UGG boots stated to be to cover the rising cost of materials. However, the resulting decline in sales volume over the first half of 2012 led to a price reduction, which stimulated sales. UGG boots accounted for 87% of the company's revenue with some analysts expressing concern that UGG was losing its appeal. While 2012 annual revenue remained approximately the same as in the prior year, profit was down 36.1% from 2011, and share prices dropped 62%.For Deckers, it's Ugg or Bust! Leo Sun March 3, 2013Deckers Rallies on New Takeover Buzz investorguide.com November 27, 2012Deckers Collapses 11% on Weak Guidance investorguide.com February 27, 2012 Trademark dispute UGG is a registered trademark in the US, Europe and many other countries. There have been various disputes within Australia, Europe, and the United States about the validity of Ugh/Ugg trademark. Deckers trades as Ugg Holdings, Inc. in Australia,Samantha Joseph, \\"\\", ART+law, Arts Law Centre of Australia, June 2004 where it is known for a trademark dispute over the use of the widely used term \\"ugg boots\\"(sometimes called uggs). In 1971, Australian surfer Shane Steadman began selling ugg boots and registered the name Ugh-boots as a trademark in Australia. In 1979 Brian Smith, another Australian surfer, brought several pairs of Australian-made sheepskin boots to the US and began selling them in New York and California. He set up Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1985 registered a US trademark on a rams head logo with the words \\"Original UGG Boot UGG Australia. He later acquired the Australian mark from Steadman. In 1995, he sold his interest to Deckers Outdoor Corporation. In 1996 Deckers registered a trademark for \\"UGG\\" in the US. In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent cease and desist letters to Australian manufacturers but did not press the issue beyond that. In 2005, the validity of the UGG trademark was challenged in Federal Court in California; the court ruled for Deckers, stating that consumers in the United States consider Ugg to be a brand name.Koolaburra Decision In his final order, the judge hearing the case stated that, although the defendants had provided anecdotal evidence of the term being used generically, Deckers had countered this by \\"submitted ... declarations from four footwear industry professionals, each of whom states that 'UGG' is widely recognized in the industry as a brand-name and not a generic term\\" and that the defendants' evidence \\"fails to demonstrate that the term 'UGG' is generic.\\" In his finding the judge did not consider whether or not \\"ugg\\" was a generic term in Australia or New Zealand, as the doctrine of foreign equivalents only relates to non-English speaking countries. A similar challenge was also rejected by a Dutch court. (PDF) It was only in the early 2000s, when demand for ugg boots was soaring, partly as a result of several celebrity endorsements of the UGG brand, and Australian manufacturers began selling uggs over the Internet, that Deckers' law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt Australian companies from using the word \\"ugg\\" in their salesefforts. In 2004, Deckers sent cease and desist letters to 20 Australian manufacturers, and Mortels Sheepskin Factory was prevented from selling uggs on eBay or from using the word in domain names. In response to these actions by Deckers, Australian manufacturers formed the Ugg Boot Footwear Association to fight the corporation's claim, arguing that \\"ugg\\" is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots. They further argued that Australian manufacturers had been making and trading this style of boot for decades, including in the US. In 2003, Bruce and Bronwyn McDougall, owners of Uggs-N-Rugs, a Western Australia-based manufacturer, started legal action alleging that Deckers had not actively used the UGH-BOOT registration in Australian commerce for the past three years. Their action was successful in 2006, and the UGH-BOOT registration was removed from the Australian Trademark Registry.Decision of a delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks with reasons published by IP Australia January 16, 2006 The officer who heard the case stated that the \\"evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods.\\" The ruling only applies in Australia, with Deckers still owning the trademarks in all other jurisdictions, including the US, China, Japan and the European Union. Counterfeit products Deckers has also been challenged by the marketing of counterfeit products, principally from China. According to the Glasgow Evening Times in July 2010, > Gangs of criminals have flooded Glasgow with fake footwear. ... Authorities > across the west of Scotland have seized hundreds of pairs of the must-have > footwear ... Neil Coltart, at Glasgow City Council, said: \\"These boots come > in boxes that look like the real thing, with tags and labels. But the > product clearly isn't the quality you'd expecty from Ugg.\\" ... Out of their > slick packaging, the boots were clearly not made of Ugg's comfy sheepskin, > but a cheap man-made fur.

Holding up a pair, [Coltart] said: \\"I think most > people would be pretty disappointed if they bought Ugg boots and brought > these home.\\"Leask, David. \\" 'Fuggs' flood the city's market in fake goods.\\" > Glasgow Evening Times, July 31, 2010, p. 9. In 2009, US customs agents confiscated 60,000 pairs of fake UGG boots, and the company took action against 2500 websites that were selling fraudulent products, as well as some 170,000 listings on eBay, Craigslist and similar sites.Clifford, Stephanie. \\"Economic Indicator: Even Cheaper Knockoffs.\\" The New York Times, July 31, 2010.

The Fairchild F-27 was similar to the standard Fokker F27, while the FH-227 was an independently developed stretched version. Design and development Air South in 1974, showing the shorter fuselage of this version. The Fokker F27 began life as a 1950 design study known as the P275, a 32-seater powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops. With the aid of Dutch government funding, the P275 evolved into the F27, which first flew on November 24, 1955. The first prototype was powered by Dart 507s and would have seated 28. To correct a slight tail- heaviness and to allow for more seats, the second prototype (which first flew in January 1957) had a fuselage, which would allow seating for 32. A Fairchild Hiller FH-227B of the defunct Mohawk Airlines circa 1970 By this stage, Fokker had signed an agreement that would see Fairchild build Friendships in the U.S. as the F-27. The first aircraft of either manufacturer to enter service in the U.S. was, in fact, a Fairchild-built F-27, with West Coast Airlines in September 1958. Other Fairchild F-27 operators in the U.S. included Air South, Air West and successor Hughes Airwest, Allegheny Airlines, Aloha Airlines, Bonanza Air Lines, Ozark Air Lines, Pacific Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989), Northern Consolidated Airlines and successor Wien Air Alaska. Fairchild subsequently manufactured a larger, stretched version of the F-27 being the Fairchild Hiller FH-227 which was operated by U.S. based air carriers Delta Air Lines, Mohawk Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989) and Wien Air Alaska. Fairchild F-27s differed from the initial Fokker F27 Mk 100s in having basic seating for 40, heavier external skinning, a lengthened nose capable of housing a weather radar, and additional fuel capacity. They also incorporated a passenger airstair door in the rear of the aircraft, operated by a flight attendant, which eliminated the need for separate stairs on the ground. Developments were the F-27A with more powerful engines and the F-27B Combi aircraft version. The F-27B Combi mixed passenger/freight version was operated in Alaska by Northern Consolidated Airlines and Wien Air Alaska. Fairchild independently developed the stretched FH-227, which appeared almost two years earlier than Fokker's similar F27 Mk 500. The FH-227 featured a 1.83 m (6 ft) stretch over standard length F27/F-27s, taking standard seating to 56, with a larger cargo area between the cockpit and the passenger cabin.

The aircraft continued up the hill and onto the airport, coming to rest 6 feet beyond the threshold and 50 feet from the right edge of the runway. A layer of dense fog was obscuring the runway threshold and about half of the approach lights. Visual conditions existed outside the fog area. All three crew members and thirty-two of the thirty-four passengers perished. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the accident on an \\"unrecognized loss of altitude orientation during the final portion of an approach into shallow, dense fog.\\" The disorientation was caused by a rapid reduction in the ground guidance segment available to the pilot at a point beyond which a go-around could be successfully effected.http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full- text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR69-06.pdf * On 25 October 1968 Northeast Airlines Flight 946, an FH-227, crashed on Moose Mountain near Hanover, New Hampshire on approach to Lebanon Municipal Airport.

Notable uses  The 1955 Looney Tunes cartoon, The Hole Idea, presents a fictional account in which Calvin Q. Calculus invents the device. The theme was repeated in The Beatles' 1968 movie, Yellow Submarine, where Ringo picks up a hole from the Sea of Holes, stores it in his pocket, and uses it later to release Sgt. Pepper's Band from captivity. In 1988, Who Framed Roger Rabbit again used a portable hole as a plot device. Detective Eddie Valiant is able to escape being crushed by a steamroller by using one, echoing the 1955 Looney Tunes gag. In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, a portable hole is a circle of cloth made from phase spider webs, strands of ether and beams of starlight. When deployed, it creates an extradimensional space six feet in diameter by ten feet deep. Folding the cloth causes the entrance to this space to disappear, but items placed inside the hole remain there. Sufficient air is contained in the hole to support life for up to ten minutes. In the novelization of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Elliott uses a portable hole when the lead characters are playing Dungeons & Dragons. In episode 695 of the Final Fantasy-based comic 8-Bit Theater, Fighter, after buying some items and a portable hole with Red Mage, decides to work smarter, not harder, and put all the items into the portable hole. He then proceeds to fold the portable hole into itself.http://www.nuklearpower.com/2006/05/13/episode-695-physics- are-for-other-people/ In Rajiv Joseph's play, Guards at the Taj, one of the characters, Humayun, invents a transportable hole. Humayun describes it as a hole one can carry and attach to anything to make a hole in it.  Other uses of the term  A 1933 newspaper described John Williamson's underwater photography apparatus as a portable \\"hole in the sea\\". It was a bendable tube from the ship to the sea bottom for a photographer to descend. A 1949 newspaper column by Truman Twill speculates on a prefabricated underground storage unit described as \\"a portable hole to be sunk in the ground at a desirable location\\". Gramicidin A has been described as a portable hole; it is a polypeptide with a helical shape. When it forms a dimer, it can embed itself in cellular bilayer membranes and form a hole through which water molecules can pass. The Museum of Modern Art has a work by Ben Vautier titled, The First Portable Hole (Le Premier trou portatif). In Shari Lewis presents 101 magic tricks for kids to do, a trick named \\"the portable hole\\" is described. A card trick titled Acme Portable Hole is available commercially.

In Central America and South America, it is the most widely distributed pygmy owl and is probably one of the most numerous owl species in those areas. It is found in a wide range of semi-open wooded habitats in these areas. Taxonomy This species is a part of the larger family Strigidae of owls, known as typical owls. This family contains most species of owls. Trinidad, as well as other localities, have endemic subspecies of the Glaucidium brasilianum owl. Recent genetics work has found substantial differences in ferruginous pygmy owls from different regions and members of the northern ridgwayi group are sometimes considered a separate species, the Ridgway's pygmy-owl (Glaucidium ridgwayi). Description This species is crepuscular, but often hunts by day. It hunts a variety of birds, lizards, mammals, and insects. The flight is often undulating in motion, similar to that of many woodpecker species. It can be readily located by the small birds that mob it while it is perched in a tree (up to 40 birds of 11 species have been recorded mobbing one owl). Appearance Glaucidium brasilianum in Mexico The ferruginous pygmy owl is small, typically , and stocky with disproportionately large feet and talons. The crown has elongated white/buff streaks, the wing coverts have white spots, and the underparts are heavily streaked white. There are prominent white supercilia above the facial disc. There are dark two spots on the nape, often termed \\"false eyes\\" by birders. Otherwise, its overall color is highly variable, ranging from grey-brown with a black-and-white barred tail to rich rufous with a uniform rufous tail. Sexes are similar with females slightly larger and often more reddish. Call The call is a whistled hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, usually in E flat. It is easily imitated, and is used by birdwatchers to attract small birds intent on mobbing the pygmy owls. Breeding and incubation The Glaucidium brasilianum mating season is from late winter to early spring. It is a cavity nesting bird (tree and columnar cactus cavities), laying 1-7 white eggs. Incubation is 28 days, with 27‚Äì30 days to fledging. Conservation The northernmost subspecies, G. b. cactorum, commonly called the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, was a listed Endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This protected it in south-central Arizona from loss of habitat and buffel grass fires. Buffel grass catches fire very easy, which spreads to cacti, burning the owl's primary habitat. Its range extends over the border into Sonora, Mexico. Glaucidium brasilianum was delisted in 2006.

It is operated by OCLC, Inc. The subscribing member libraries collectively maintain WorldCat's database, the world's largest bibliographic database. The database includes other information sources in addition to member library collections. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as resource sharing and collection management). WorldCat is used by the general public and by librarians for cataloging and research. History OCLC was founded in 1967 under the leadership of Fred Kilgour. That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971. In 2003, OCLC began the \\"Open WorldCat\\" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries' collections. In October 2005, the OCLC technical staff began a wiki project, WikiD, allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record. WikiD was later phased out, although WorldCat later incorporated user-generated content in other ways. In 2006, it became possible for anyone to search WorldCat directly at its open website, not only through the subscription FirstSearch interface where it had been available on the web to subscribing libraries for more than a decade before. Options for more sophisticated searches of WorldCat have remained available through the FirstSearch interface. In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million \\"identities\\", which are metadata about names‚Äîpredominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles. In 2017, OCLC's WorldCat Search API was integrated into the cite tool of Wikipedia's VisualEditor, allowing Wikipedia editors to cite sources from WorldCat easily. Beginning in 2017, OCLC and the Internet Archive have collaborated to make the Internet Archive's records of digitized books available in WorldCat. As of July 2020, WorldCat contained almost 500 million bibliographic records in 483 languages, representing over 3 billion physical and digital library assets, and the WorldCat persons dataset (mined from WorldCat) included over 100 million people. Model WorldCat contains records in MAchine Readable Cataloging (MARC) format contributed by library catalogers worldwide who use OCLC as a cataloging tool, and these MARC format records can also be downloaded into other libraries' local catalog systems. This allows libraries to find and download records for materials they are adding to their local catalog, without having to undergo the lengthy process of creating a new catalog entry from scratch for each new item. WorldCat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model. That is, WorldCat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real- time or every day. Consequently: * WorldCat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library but does not provide that library's call number. * WorldCat does not indicate whether an item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons (thereby forcing interested patrons to submit a retrieval request and wait). * Furthermore, WorldCat does not show whether a library owns multiple copies of a particular title. As an alternative, WorldCat allows participating institutions to add direct links from WorldCat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status. However, this still requires users to open multiple Web pages, each pointing to a different online public access catalog with its own distinctive user interface design (which places item status in a different portion of the Web browser display), until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library. Library contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program, which was introduced in 2001; its predecessor, OCLC Passport, was phased out in May 2005.

Without a GUI builder, a GUI must be built by manually specifying each widget's parameters in source-code, with no visual feedback until the program is run. User interfaces are commonly programmed using an event-driven architecture, so GUI builders also simplify creating event-driven code. This supporting code connects widgets with the outgoing and incoming events that trigger the functions providing the application logic. Some graphical user interface builders, such as e.g. Glade Interface Designer, automatically generate all the source code for a graphical control element.

It is linked by Karnare Col to Mount Strybing in the southern Sentinel Range. The ninth-highest mountain in Antarctica was first climbed in January 1992. The name Mount Craddock was originally recommended by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1965 for the present-day Craddock Massif but subsequent maps limited Mount Craddock to the massif's southernmost peak, a position that became established over years. To avoid confusion and to fix the position of the name, US-ACAN redefined Mount Craddock in 2006 to apply to the southernmost peak described above.USGS GNIS The mountain was named by US-ACAN for J. Campbell Craddock (1930‚Äì2006), leader of a University of Minnesota expedition (1962‚Äì63) that made geological investigations and cartographic surveys in the Sentinel and Heritage Ranges of the Ellsworth Mountains. During 1960‚Äì61, Craddock led a Minnesota geological expedition in examining the Jones Mountains. Mount Craddock is the second- highest point of the Craddock Massif which includes Mount Rutford (highest point), Rada Peak, and Bugue√±o Pinnacle. Rutford was named for R. H.

He is currently serving ten years in federal prison for stealing millions of dollars in order to fuel his gambling habit. Early life A native of Bloomingburg, Ohio, Schlichter was a star at Miami Trace High School; he never lost a game as a starter. His gambling habit began in high school with a visit to Scioto Downs, a harness racing track near Columbus. He and several friends pooled their resources to bet on a race at Scioto Downs, and won. He quickly became a regular, and Scioto Downs remained his favorite track over the years. Schlichter was a four-year starter at Ohio State University. He was the last starting quarterback for legendary Buckeyes coach Woody Hayes. Schlichter threw the interception that led to Hayes' assault on Clemson linebacker Charlie Bauman in the 1978 Gator Bowl, an act that led to the coach's firing the next day.Scorecard. Sports Illustrated, January 8, 1979. Schlichter finished in the top six of Heisman Trophy balloting during his last three years‚Äîfourth as a sophomore, sixth as a junior and fifth as a senior. In his sophomore year, 1979, he led the Buckeyes to an undefeated regular season. They had a chance to win at least a share of the national championship in the Rose Bowl, but lost to USC by a single point. In his four years as a Buckeye, 1978 through 1981, Schlichter tallied 7,547 passing yards and 50 touchdown passes, with 46 interceptions. He also rushed for 1,303 yards and 35 touchdowns. At the time, he was Ohio State's all-time leader in total offense. In 1981, sports writer Ritter Collett published a biography of Schlichter, Straight Arrow. During his college career, Schlichter was frequently spotted at Scioto Downs with a big-time Ohio gambler. Although the Columbus and OSU police departments became suspicious, the athletic department felt it lacked enough evidence to go to the NCAA about the matter. By his junior year, he had lost several thousand dollars gambling on college and professional sports. On several occasions he was seen at the track with Hayes' successor as head coach, Earle Bruce, a fact which helped cover up early problems emerging while Schlichter was at Ohio State. Professional career Schlichter was picked fourth in the 1982 NFL Draft (in the same class that included Jim McMahon of Brigham Young University and Marcus Allen of the University of Southern California) by the Baltimore Colts (who moved to Indianapolis two years later). Expected to be the starter, he lost the job to Mike Pagel, the Colts' fourth-round pick in that year. However, he was expected to be the Colts' quarterback of the future. His gambling continued unabated; he blew his entire $350,000 signing bonus by midseason. His gambling spiraled out of control during the 1982 NFL strike; he lost $20,000 betting on college football. By the end of the strike, he had at least $700,000 in gambling debts. Years later, he said his massive losses stemmed from desperate efforts to make good his previous losses. After losing $20,000 in the first week of the strike, he doubled up the next week and lost again‚Äîstarting a cycle that would continue for over a year. In the winter of 1982 and the spring of 1983, Schlichter lost $489,000 betting on basketball games, and his bookies threatened to expose him if he did not pay up (the NFL forbids its players from engaging in any kind of gambling activity, legal or otherwise). Schlichter went to the FBI in March 1983, and his testimony helped get the bookies arrested on federal charges. He also sought the help of the NFL because he feared the bookies would force him to throw games in return for not telling the Colts about his activities. The league suspended him indefinitely. Schlichter was the first NFL player to be suspended for gambling since Alex Karras and Paul Hornung were suspended in 1963 for betting on NFL games. He was reinstated for the 1984 season, but later admitted that he'd gambled during his suspension (though not on football). He was released five games into the 1985 season in part because the Colts heard rumors he was gambling again. As it turned out, he lost a significant amount of money over the spring and summer while playing golf, and wrote one of his golfing partners a check for $2,000. The check was to be cashed after the season started. However, when the golfing partner called the Colts to see if the check was good, team and league officials feared Schlichter had relapsed. The league wanted him to take a lie-detector test, but the Colts had already seen enough and released him. It would be Schlichter's last meaningful action in the NFL. He signed as a free agent with the Buffalo Bills in the spring of 1986. However, his tenure in Buffalo effectively ended when the United States Football League collapsed. Jim Kelly, the Bills' 1983 first-round pick, had bolted to the USFL instead, but signed with the Bills when the USFL lost its antitrust lawsuit. The Bills had intended all along for Kelly to be their quarterback of the future; with Kelly now firmly in the Bills fold, Schlichter's services were no longer necessary. He sat out the 1986 season after no other team expressed interest. In January 1987, Schlichter was arrested in New York City for his involvement in a multimillion-dollar sports betting operation. He pleaded guilty to illegal gambling in April, and was sentenced to probation. That arrest came back to haunt him that summer. The Cincinnati Bengals saw enough promise in him that they were willing to bring him on as Boomer Esiason's backup. However, Commissioner Pete Rozelle would not approve the deal, citing the January arrest. He let it be known that he would not approve any NFL contract for Schlichter, costing him valuable work when the NFL players' union went on strike that year. He made another bid for reinstatement in 1988, but was turned down. That same year, he filed for bankruptcy to shield himself from creditors. In parts of three seasons, Schlichter played only 13 games, primarily in backup or \\"mop-up\\" roles. He made only six starts, losing them all. He threw 202 passes and completed 91 of them. He threw three touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. He amassed a quarterback rating of only 42.6, and is considered one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history. In 2007, Schlichter was listed as the #7 all-time draft bust on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Busts episode. In an updated list aired on April 16, 2010, Schlichter was moved to the #4 draft bust of all time, and in a video listing the top 10 quarterback draft busts of all time, Schlichter was listed #3, behind #2 JaMarcus Russell and #1 Ryan Leaf. Years later, Schlichter said that he was distracted for much of his NFL career. He went through a messy breakup with his girlfriend before his rookie season, and the ensuing depression led him to gamble more. He believed that accolades he received after his sophomore year at Ohio State diminished his drive, and the pressure of living up to that praise led him to gamble more. Schlichter briefly signed a contract with the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League. He was named the starter out of camp, and saw his first meaningful game action in three years. However, he suffered broken ribs after a brutal hit, and was waived midway through the season. He played for the Arena Football League for the Detroit Drive in 1990 and 1991, leading them to a third consecutive league title in 1990 as the league's MVP. He was traded to the expansion Cincinnati Rockers before the 1992 season, and helped lead them to the playoffs in their inaugural season. However, he announced he would not return to the team in 1993, intending instead to focus on curing his gambling addiction, although other reasons have surfaced since then (referenced in the \\"extent of addiction\\" section below). Radio career While co-hosting a Rockers-focused radio show on WSAI, he did well enough that he became the station's afternoon drive-time host. During this time, he appeared on The Phil Donahue Show, talking about his addiction. In 1994, he moved to KVEG in Las Vegas, but was fired after a few months for stealing checks from the station's owner in order to get money to gamble. Extent of addiction Over the years, Schlichter has, by his own count, committed more than 20 felonies. He gambled away much of his NFL, Arena League and radio salaries. Whenever he ran low on money to support his gambling, he stole and conned it from friends and strangers. He also passed bad checks. When he started gambling, casinos still took personal checks. He would write a check to the casino and use the money to gamble, believing he would win enough money to pay the casino back and keep the profit. However, he almost always lost. In a 2007 interview for ESPN's Outside the Lines, he estimated that he'd stolen $1.5 million over the years, if not more. Between 1987 and 1992, Schlichter was arrested three times in Ohio for passing a total of $50,000 in bad checks. In part because he was still remembered for his stardom at OSU, he received probation or suspended sentences each time. He moved to Las Vegas in 1989 soon after marrying longtime girlfriend Mitzi Shinaver‚Äìironically, in hopes of getting treatment for his addiction. However, his gambling continued unabated. He ran up massive gambling debts while playing for the Detroit Drive, though general manager Gary Vitto helped pay some of them off. Soon after arriving in Cincinnati, he was arrested in July for passing a bad check. He admitted suffering a relapse, but the Rockers were willing to stand by him. They worked out a deal with Schlichter in which they put most of his paycheck into an account to pay his gambling debts, except for $300 which they gave to Mitzi. However, by the end of the 1992 season, the Rockers were losing patience with him, and asked him to take a substantial pay cut if he wanted to return for the 1993 season. In a 2020 interview, former AFL commissioner Joe O'Hara claimed that Schlichter was forced out of the AFL when he was actually caught betting on AFL games. The habit took a considerable toll on his marriage. Mitzi did her best to protect herself and their two children. For instance, she never allowed Art to have a checkbook. However, soon after they moved back to Las Vegas in 1994, he took a box of old checks from her sister and used them to get money to gamble. He lost it all, and when it was apparent he couldn't pay it back, the bank reported him to the FBI. Mitzi lost patience with him and took her two daughters back to Indiana. After losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, along with virtually all he owned, he went back to Indiana as well in hopes of reconciling with Mitzi. Soon afterward, in October, he was charged with fraud for passing $175,000 in bad checks at Las Vegas casinos, many of which he'd stolen from KVEG's owner. He'd passed most of the checks at Treasure Island. When he pleaded guilty, federal prosecutors were initially willing to go easy on him and offer a deal that would let him self-report to a federal prison camp for a sentence of 15 months. However, when prosecutors learned that he'd been passing bad checks in Indiana as well, they persuaded a judge to remand him to custody. In January 1995, he was sentenced to two years in prison. Prosecutors later discovered Schlichter had passed $500,000 in bad checks in Indiana, Nevada, and his native Ohio. He was released in April 1996 after serving 16 months, only to be arrested again that fall for stealing checks from his employer and using them to get $8,500 to gamble. This time, he was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. Mitzi formally divorced him soon afterward, in 1998. He was released on probation in 1999 after serving 13 months. He returned home to Bloomingburg, where he told friends that he still had connections to get prime tickets for Buckeye football games. He told others that if they fronted him the money to buy the tickets, he would share the profits. As it turned out, it was a scheme to get more money to gamble. He ultimately stole $500,000 from a dozen individuals‚Äîincluding his own father‚Äîbefore he was arrested, pled guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. All told, between 1995 and 2006, he served the equivalent of ten years in 44 different county jails and federal prisons. Counting time served while awaiting sentencing, he spent all but 358 days between November 1994 and June 2006 behind bars. Even then, he was so consumed by his habit that he had his public defender smuggle a cell phone into prison so he could place bets. He later said that he hit rock bottom in 2004, after he was caught gambling in prison and placed in solitary confinement. He was originally supposed to spend four months there. However, he was released after 100 days for good behavior. He was released from prison on June 16, 2006, and resided with his mother in Washington Court House, Ohio. By one estimate, he owed half a million dollars in restitution. Schlichter founded a non-profit organization, Gambling Prevention Awareness, to educate others about the perils of compulsive gambling, including college and NFL players. He told ESPN that he started gambling because the pressure of being Ohio State's starting quarterback was too much on him, and he wanted to be just a regular guy. In late 2009, Schlichter and his mother appeared in TV ads opposing an Ohio casino statewide ballot issue. He also wrote an autobiography, Busted, with sportswriter Jeff Snook. Also in 2009, he began working at Columbus radio station WTVN, joining longtime host John Corby on Wednesdays. 2011 arrest Around the same time, Schlichter reunited with Anita Vatko Barney, a Columbus heiress and the widow of the former CEO of Wendy's. Her son, Alan Vatko, had been gravely injured in a 1981 plane crash that killed his father and three others; Barney believed that Alan's recovery was due in large part to Schlichter visiting his bedside. Over the next two-plus years, Schlichter conned over a million dollars out of Barney, nearly depleting her fortune. On February 9, 2011, reports emerged that Schlichter was under investigation for fraud. It subsequently emerged that Schlichter had conned thousands of dollars under the pretense of buying prime seats at Ohio State football games. Schlichter was charged with a first-degree felony in connection with the theft of more than $1 million on February 14, 2011. Prosecutors later said that Schlichter started gambling again almost as soon as he left prison. They discovered he'd visited gambling dens in Nevada, West Virginia, Indiana, and casino riverboats along the Ohio River. He relaunched his ticket-buying scheme as early as 2009. Corby recalled that in that year, Schlichter suggested that he had connections to get Buckeye basketball tickets. Corby almost went along, but thought better of it after his wife noticed it was very similar to a scheme Schlichter described in his book. As it turned out, Schlichter got tickets from ticket brokers across central Ohio, often paying four times face value. As the scheme went along, he forced Barney to solicit her wealthy friends for money and help him buy tickets. By late 2010, Schlichter sensed he was nearing the end of his tether. In a desperate attempt to stem the tide, he promised to get tickets for Super Bowl XLV. However, when that scheme collapsed, Schlichter turned himself in on February 9, 2011. He subsequently admitted that he \\"probably\\" used part of the money to gamble. On September 15, 2011, Schlichter pleaded guilty to state charges of theft and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. He was sentenced to 10 years in state prison. A month later, on October 11, he pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud, bank fraud and filing a false tax return. He admitted to using the money he obtained from the ticket scam to either gamble, pay back previous debts, or buy personal items. He also admitted to falsifying his 2008 tax return and hiding almost $38,500 in income from the government.Press release announcing federal plea deal While under house arrest awaiting assignment to a state prison, Schlichter tested positive for cocaine while serving house arrest on federal charges resulting from the same case (and while still on probation from his Indiana sentence) on January 19, 2012. On May 4, 2012, as a result of the positive drug test, Schlichter was sentenced to 10 years, 7 months in federal prison (up from an original 8 years, 4 months sentence originally agreed to on the fraud case) to be served concurrently with the Ohio sentence, plus $2.2 million in restitution; the Indiana probation was canceled with the federal sentence. Barney admitted her role in the scheme, and cooperated with prosecutors and law enforcement to bring Schlichter down. She was later sentenced to three years' probation. She was also ordered to pay $400,000 in restitution, forcing her to auction off nearly all she owned and give up her house. In 2015, Barney published a book, Quarterback Sneak, recounting her experiences with Schlichter. She believes that Schlichter set his sights on her soon after they met at a church in Westerville, Ohio, where he was speaking about his addiction. As of December 2017, Schlichter is listed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as being incarcerated at FCI Williamsburg in Salters, South Carolina, with a release date of August 18, 2020. Health issues Doctors have diagnosed Schlichter with Parkinson's disease and dementia‚Äîthe side effects of numerous concussions (between 15 and 17, depending on the source) suffered over 20 years of football at the junior high, high school, college and professional levels. His public defender in the 2011 case, Steven Nolder, said that Schlichter has been diagnosed with \\"deficits\\" in his frontal lobes, which have been linked to depression, impulsivity and impaired judgment. According to Snook, doctors believe that Schlichter has chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease caused by repeated blows to the head. Protective equipment (especially helmets) was inferior during much of Schlichter's high school, collegiate and NFL days, and head injuries were simply considered part of the game. In popular culture Schlichter was mentioned in the 2006 Prison Break episode \\"By the Skin and the Teeth\\", and in 2017 was the subject of Season 11, Episode 14 of American Greed titled \\"Art Schlichter, All American Fraud.\\" See also * 1978 Ohio State Buckeyes football team ‚Äî 1978 Gator Bowl * 1979 Ohio State Buckeyes football team ‚Äî 1980 Rose Bowl * 1980 Ohio State Buckeyes football team ‚Äî 1980 Fiesta Bowl * 1981 Ohio State Buckeyes football team ‚Äî 1981 Liberty Bowl ReferencesFurther reading External links * Arena football statistics * Ohio State statistics at Sports Reference 1960 births Living people American people of German descent Players of American football from Ohio People from Washington Court House, Ohio American football quarterbacks Ohio State Buckeyes football players Baltimore Colts players Indianapolis Colts players Detroit Drive players Cincinnati Rockers players American players of Canadian football Canadian football quarterbacks Ottawa Rough Riders players American people convicted of theft Criminals from Ohio Prisoners and detainees of Ohio American sportspeople convicted of crimes ","title":"Art Schlichter"},{"id":"1339913","text":"Samuel Udoka Oji (born 9 October 1985) is an English semi-professional footballer who plays as a centre back for club Highgate United.

Written by Arthur H. Singer (based on a story by Gene Roddenberry) and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast on June 3, 1969. In the episode, a woman switches bodies with Captain Kirk and then tries to take over command of the Enterprise. Originally scheduled to air at 10pm on Friday, March 28, 1969, NBC pre-empted it with a special report on former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died earlier that day. On June 3, 1969, after an absence of 2 months, Star Trek was brought back on a new night and time: Tuesdays at 7:30pm. \\"Turnabout Intruder\\" was the only first-run episode to be shown in this new time slot. This was the last original episode of Star Trek to air on NBC, and was the only episode of the series produced even partly in 1969. The very last material filmed for Star Trek was the story's opening sequence, committed to 35mm film on January 3, 1969. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise answers a distress call from the planet Camus II, the site of an archaeological expedition. Among the survivors are Dr. Janice Lester, with whom Captain Kirk was once intimately involved, and the expedition's physician, Dr. Arthur Coleman. Coleman claims that Lester is suffering from radiation exposure. Dr. Coleman, Science Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy leave to tend to the other survivors, leaving Lester and Kirk alone. Kirk explores the room, and as he examines an alien machine, she activates it, paralyzing him. She then joins Kirk in the machine and activates it again. From each of their bodies a ghostly image emerges and then disappears into the other's body. The person appearing to be Kirk then declares that Janice Lester has taken the place of Captain Kirk, and begins to strangle the person appearing to be Lester. Spock and McCoy return before ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù can finish the job, and he orders the landing party and the remaining survivors back to the Enterprise. Once there, he gives Dr. Coleman full authority for treatment of ‚ÄúJanice Lester‚Äù, over McCoy's protests. Alone, Coleman and ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù discuss the situation. It is revealed that the two conspired to kill the expedition's personnel. Lester has now achieved her lifelong goal of commanding a starship. Spock becomes suspicious when ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù orders a course change to the Benecia Colony to drop off ‚ÄúLester‚Äù for medical attention, despite the fact that Benecia's medical facilities are comparatively primitive, and that it would unnecessarily interfere with their current mission. McCoy invokes his authority to order a medical examination of the captain, including a personality test. ‚ÄúLester‚Äù regains consciousness and seeks help from Spock and McCoy. ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù slaps her back into unconsciousness, and orders her to be put in isolation. Spock interviews ‚ÄúLester‚Äù and is somewhat skeptical of her story. ‚ÄúLester‚Äù suggests that he use his telepathic abilities to learn the truth, and he is convinced. Spock tries to free ‚ÄúLester‚Äù but is stopped by a security team led by the impostor Kirk, who accuses Spock of mutiny and orders a court-martial. Once on trial, Spock argues that Captain Kirk is really in the body of Dr. Lester. ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù suggests that Spock's real goal is to take command himself and offers to drop charges if Spock will desist. Spock refuses, and ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù flies into a hysterical rage. Shocked by Kirk's behavior, McCoy and Chief Engineer Scott confer secretly in the corridor. Scott believes that if Spock is acquitted, the \\"captain\\" won't let the decision stand, making it necessary to mutiny. ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù, having monitored their conversation, declares McCoy, Scott, Spock, and ‚ÄúLester‚Äù guilty of mutiny and condemned to death. On the bridge, Chekov and Sulu, having witnessed the trial, determine to resist the ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù, and refuse to obey his orders. Loudly accusing them of mutiny, ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù falls into his chair, and an image of Lester emerges from his body, only to return again. ‚ÄúKirk‚Äù runs to Coleman, who tells him that the transfer is reversing itself, and that Kirk, in Lester's body, must die in order to prevent it. The two head to the brig intending to inject ‚ÄúLester‚Äù with a toxic substance. ‚ÄúLester‚Äù resists, and the reversal now completes itself. The hysterical Lester begs Coleman to kill Kirk. Coleman then pleads with Kirk to allow him to care for her. The Enterprise proceeds on its mission. Production and reception The episode drew Nielsen ratings of only 8.8, in contrast to rival shows Lancer on CBS and The Mod Squad on ABC, which gained ratings of 14.7 and 15.2 respectively, a drop of over fifty percent since the show premiered. Cultural theorist Cassandra Amesley states that this episode is \\"agreed to be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever shown\\" by Star Trek fans. Brenton J. Malin sees the episode as a reactionary response to the radical feminism of the late 1960s. Dr. Lester is a \\"caricature and condemnation of the feminism of the late '60s, evoking a fear of powerful, power-hungry women.... The message seems clear: women want to kill men and take their jobs, but ultimately they can't handle them.\\"Malin, Brenton, American Masculinity Under Clinton: Popular Media and the Nineties \\"crisis of Masculinity\\", Peter Lang, 2005, p.113. David Greven has a more positive view of the episode, even referring to it as \\"moving\\". He calls it the \\"infamous last episode\\" of the original series, in part because of the \\"campiness\\" of Shatner's performance when portraying himself as a female in a male's body, but also because of the sexist premise that \\"female desire for power was a clear sign of insanity\\". While accepting that \\"the sexism of the episode is indisputable\\", he argues that the exploration of the idea that man can inhabit a woman's body, and vice versa, gives the episode a \\"radical\\" dimension, which he claims implies the interchangeability of gender and sexual identity.David Greven, Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek: Allegories of Desire in the Television Series and Films, McFarland, 2009, pp.30-33. In 2015, W.I.R.E.D. magazine recommended skipping this episode in their binge-watching guide for the original series. In 2016, CNET ranked this episode as the 4th worst episode of all Star Trek, based on rankings between an audience and discussion hosts at a 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas. In 2017, this episode was rated the 4th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise including later spin-off series, by ScreenRant. A ranking of every episode of the original series by Hollywood, placed this episode in last place. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the 7th worst Star Trek episode of the original series.The 15 Best Worst Episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series ReferencesExternal links \\"Turnabout Intruder\\" Story outline dated May 8, 1968; Report and analysis by Dave Eversole Star Trek: The Original Series (season 3) episodes 1969 American television episodes American television series finales Fiction about body swapping ","title":"Turnabout Intruder"},{"id":"1339955","text":"\\"The Savage Curtain\\" is the twenty-second episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek. Written by Gene Roddenberry and Arthur Heinemann (based on an original story by Roddenberry) and directed by Herschel Daugherty, it was first broadcast on March 7, 1969. In the episode, aliens force Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock to join forces with beings who appear to be Abraham Lincoln and Surak to battle villains in a contest between good and evil. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the volcanic planet of Excalbia to conduct a geological survey. Impossibly, sensors detect carbon-based life on the planet's surface. The image of Abraham Lincoln drifts toward the ship on the viewscreen. Though skeptical that the figure is the real president, Kirk extends full presidential honors as he transports aboard the ship. Lincoln is human, has no knowledge of technology past the 19th century, but is somehow familiar with the Vulcan philosophy of Nom (meaning \\"all\\"). Lincoln invites Kirk and Spock to accompany him down to the planet where an area has appeared with Earth-like conditions. Despite the possibility that the livable conditions are an illusion, Kirk accepts, reasoning that the Enterprises mission demands they accept any offer of contact with new life. Once on the planet, Kirk and Spock discover their tricorder and phasers did not transport with them. They are met by Surak, \\"the father of Vulcan civilization\\", who died centuries before. A rock-like being with clawed hands and glowing eyes atop a bulbous head, named Yarnek, announces that the inhabitants of the planet wish to conduct an experiment to determine which human philosophy is stronger: good or evil. In this experiment, Earth warlord Colonel Phillip Green, Klingon warlord Kahless, a practitioner of unethical experiments on humanoids named Zora, and Genghis Khan, together representing evil, will be pitted against Kirk, Spock, Lincoln, and Surak (representing good) in a fight to the death. Colonel Green offers Kirk an alliance against the Excalbians so that they can all safely return to where they came from, but this is only a distraction for a surprise attack. Kirk and his companions fend off their opponents and run for cover. Kirk and his companions remain resolved that the Excalbians are the true enemy. Kirk attacks Yarnek, but the alien's body is too hot to touch. To force them to fight, Yarnek breaks down the shielding between the matter and anti-matter on the Enterprise, ensuring the ship will explode unless Kirk's force emerges victorious in four hours. Kirk and the others begin to manufacture spears. Surak, whose life experiences have taught him that persistent efforts at peace are the best course, obtains permission to go alone to the enemy camp and negotiate. Green's group kills Surak and lures the others in by mimicking Surak crying for help. Lincoln offers to sneak around and free Surak while Kirk and Spock provide a diversion. When Lincoln arrives, he finds Surak's corpse and the waiting Kahless and Green, who kill him. Though now outnumbered two-to-one, when Kirk and Spock confront Green's group in battle, they quickly flee. Despite the conditions of a fight to the death remaining unfulfilled, Yarnek announces that the experiment is over. He concludes that evil retreats when confronted, and that the methods and goals of the two philosophies are the same. Kirk demands that Yarnek justify his toying with other beings; Yarnek responds that he identifies with the same thirst for knowledge that led Kirk to beam down to Excalbia. The Excalbians allow Kirk and Spock to return to the Enterprise. Though the mystery of Lincoln and Surak remains unsolved, Spock offers the conjecture that the Excalbians, using their apparent ability to reform matter, reformed other living beings into the likenesses of Lincoln and Surak, and tapped Kirk and Spock's minds to create the personalities which they imagined those historical figures had. Reception In 2017, Screen Rant ranked this episode the 12th worst episode of the Star Trek franchise and in 2018 ranked it as the 9th worst. Legacy The costume created for Colonel Phillip Green was thought to have been recycled later as Mork's red spacesuit (but with the white triangle) on both Happy Days and Mork & Mindy.

The episode was written by Arthur Heinemann, based on a story by Heinemann and D. C. Fontana (using the pen name \\"Michael Richards\\"). It was directed by David Alexander, and first broadcast on February 21, 1969. In the episode, the Enterprise is hijacked by a hippie- like group obsessed with finding a mythical paradise. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is in pursuit of the stolen space cruiser Aurora. In trying to escape, the Aurora overloads its engines and its six passengers are safely beamed aboard the Enterprise just as the Aurora explodes. The group consists of Tongo Rad, son of the Catullan ambassador; Irina Galliulin, an acquaintance of Ensign Chekov; Dr. Ton Sevrin, a noted Tiburonian electronics, acoustics, and communications researcher; Adam, a musician; and two other women. In responses to Kirk's questions, Dr. Sevrin says their destination is the planet \\"Eden\\", which Kirk responds is a myth. The group refuses to co- operate with Kirk, but are impressed by First Officer Spock, who is familiar with their movement. They are persuaded to go to Sickbay for a medical examination which reveals the party to be in good health, except for Dr. Sevrin, who is a carrier of a bacterium that is a product of artificial environments. Sevrin is quarantined in the brig, and tells Spock that the planet Eden will somehow \\"cleanse\\" him. Spock attempts to reason with Sevrin and offers to help him find Eden in exchange for his cooperation, but concludes that Sevrin is not sane. The rest of the group plan to take over the ship. After putting on a music concert, during which Tongo Rad frees Sevrin, the group takes over Auxiliary Control and puts the Enterprise on course for Eden. On arrival at the planet, Sevrin renders all Enterprise crew unconscious with an ultrasonic frequency broadcast through the intercom. When the crew regain consciousness, they discover that Sevrin and his followers have stolen a shuttlecraft. Kirk deactivates Sevrin's sonic device, and then joins Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chekov in a search for the group. The planet surface is lush and beautiful. However, all the plant life secretes a powerful acid, as Chekov discovers when he touches a flower. The team soon finds Adam, lying dead from poisonous fruit. Sevrin and the other survivors are then found in the shuttlecraft, all with burns on their feet. Kirk says they must leave, but Sevrin runs from the shuttle, bites into one of the fruits, and dies. Back on the Enterprise, Irina comes to the bridge to say goodbye to Chekov. Spock advises her and her friends not to give up their search for Eden, as he believes they will either find it, or create one for themselves. Production Originally, the teleplay was titled \\"Joanna\\", and was written by D. C. Fontana, the title character being Dr. McCoy's daughter, who would become romantically involved with Captain Kirk. Later, she was changed to Irina, and Chekov was made her foil.Joanna the precursor to \\"The Way to Eden\\" report & analysis by Dave Eversole Fontana's script was so heavily rewritten that she asked for her name to be removed from it and replaced with her pseudonym Michael Richards, which she also used for the episode \\"That Which Survives\\".D.C.Fontana on IMDB In a 2009 interview with The A.V. Club, Charles Napier recalled auditioning for the part of Adam, which was his first guest starring role. He won the part by jumping onto a table and singing \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" in front of others trying for the part. Reception The episode has generally been seen as one of the weakest in the show's history, but its portrayal of characters representing the counter- culture of the late 1960s has produced widespread comment. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'C-' rating, describing the \\"space hippie\\" characters as \\"too strange and irritating for me to view them sympathetically\\" and finding fault with the singing, which he described as \\"the worst kind of padding\\". Handlen noted as a positive aspect that the episode did allow for the voice of dissent against the \\"utopia\\" portrayed by Star Trek. In their compendium of Star Trek reviews, Trek Navigator, Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross both viewed the episode negatively, describing it as having aged badly because of the hippie characters and also noting the poor musical parts of the episode. Grace Lee Whitney, who had played Janice Rand in early episodes of the show, described the episode as a \\"clinker\\" on a par with another third season episode \\"Spock's Brain;\\" and actor James Doohan, who portrayed Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, often called it \\"a nothing episode.\\" Several writers have discussed the way the episode represents the \\"space hippies\\". Aniko Bodroghkozy touched on the topic in her book Groove Tube: Sixties Television and the Youth Rebellion. In it, Bodroghkozy noted a negative and positive portrayal; on one hand Sevrin's followers have been duped and must return to \\"civilization, apparently contrite, chastened children\\". On the other, they challenged the supposed benefits and superiority of the Federation, which Bodroghkozy described as a \\"reading of the counterculture.\\" Timothy Brown argues that Dr. Sevrin is \\"a clear stand-in for Timothy Leary.\\" Like the acolytes of Leary, Charles Manson, and other counter-culture leaders, Sevrin's followers are \\"under the spell of charismatic but dangerously unhinged leaders\\" and \\"stand for a sixties generation in the thrall of misled idealism.\\"Brown, Timothy, \\"United States of Amnesia: 1968 in the USA\\" Memories of 1968: International Perspectives, Ingo Cornils, Sarah Waters (eds), Peter Lang, 2010, p.142. In 2015, W.I.R.E.D. magazine suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the number one \\"best worst\\" Star Trek episode of the original series, noting its unique entertainment value. In 2016, TVline ranked this as having one of the top twenty moments of Star Trek, in this case the \\"space hippie\\" concert in the Enterprise sick bay (a sort of spacecraft medical facility). Legacy=In Star Trek The original script, as written by Fontana, would have provided much background on McCoy, including an unsuccessful marriage which led him into Starfleet (which was later incorporated into the alternate reality of the 2009 film Star Trek). Joanna herself was mentioned in the animated Star Trek episode \\"The Survivor\\". McCoy's backstory was later incorporated into the non-canon novels Planet of Judgment, Shadows on the Sun, Crisis on Centaurus, and also in the Marvel Comics Star Trek book (1980), married to a Vulcan and still hostile to her father. In a 2009 interview with The A.V. Club, Charles Napier recalled being invited to star again on Star Trek, as part of an anniversary celebration. He agreed to appear only if he could play a military character and not \\"wear that silly shirt again\\". His next Star Trek character would be General Denning in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Little Green Men\\".

Smiltynƒó () is a part of Klaipƒóda city municipality in Lithuania. It is located on the northern tip of the Curonian Spit, next to a narrow strait which connects the Curonian Lagoon to the Baltic Sea. Across the strait, on the Lithuanian mainland, is the port city of Klaipƒóda. Ferries transport vehicles and people daily between the two cities across the strait, as there is no connecting bridge. Smiltynƒó serves as a public beach for Klaipƒóda residents, as ports take up the coastline around Klaipƒóda. The village began as a travel point between Memel (present-day Klaipƒóda) and K√∂nigsberg (present-day Kaliningrad). Travelers would stay to rest or wait for better weather to cross the strait. Smiltynƒó is first mentioned in 1429. An inn and tavern were built in 1525. It largely depends on travelers for revenue, and thus was hurt during the wars of the 19th and 20th century. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the village was just an inn with a handful of fishermen houses but later turned into a popular resort among wealthy residents of Klaipƒóda. Smiltynƒó became part of the Klaipƒóda municipality in 1897, and soon after it became legal to sell land to individuals. In 1901 a large, luxurious, and popular two-story hotel with a restaurant and casino was built and was named the Kurhaus. Other villas were built as well. However, after World War II, the luxury lifestyle of the village came to an end. Many older buildings have survived to this day, most having been refurbished. Most of the populace moved away as well, and today only about 50 full-time residents remain. North of Smiltynƒó is a small cemetery, used before World War II. The village also has a nature museum, which educates visitors about the geology, changing landscape, and unique fauna and flora of the spit. Just a few hundred meters away from the Kurhaus there is pier big enough to accommodate up to 100 yachts. With a modern hotel and restaurant, it is a popular spot for international yachters.

Written by Margaret Armen (based on a story by David Gerrold and Oliver Crawford) and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast on February 28, 1969. In the episode, Captain Kirk races against time to acquire plague-fighting minerals from a world suffering from a grievous social class disparity. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the planet Ardana to take on a shipment of zenite, needed elsewhere to halt a botanical plague. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock beam directly to the zenite mines, where a group of miners, led by a young woman, attempt to take them hostage. High Advisor Plasus arrives with a security force, driving the miners off, and invites Kirk and Spock to return with him to the floating city of Stratos. Kirk and Spock are entertained as guests until the zenite can be recovered. They learn Ardanan society is divided between the Troglytes, who perform all physical labor, and city-dwellers who live in luxury. A group of Troglytes known as the Disruptors are rebelling against the elites. While Kirk is resting, Vanna, leader of the Disrupters, attempts to take him hostage. Kirk overpowers her, recognizes her as the woman he saw at the mine and questions her. She accuses the Stratos city-dwellers of using the Enterprise to intimidate the Troglytes. Spock and a Stratos security guard arrive, and Vanna is subdued. She is then taken for interrogation under the \\"rays\\", which induce intense pain as a form of torture. Kirk is outraged by Plasus's actions and demands the interrogation be stopped. Plasus instead orders Kirk and Spock to leave Stratos immediately and forbids them to return. The two return to the Enterprise where Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy reports that unprocessed zenite emits an odorless, invisible gas which diminishes mental capacity and heightens emotions. Spock believes that Troglytes serving aboard the floating city have been spared the effects of the gas, enabling them to organize the rebellion. Kirk contacts Plasus and offers special masks that filter the zenite gas. Plasus, however, regards Kirk's proposal as unwarranted interference in his government's affairs. Kirk then beams down to Vanna's holding cell, informs her of the effects of zenite gas, and makes his offer to her. Vanna is skeptical at first but appears to trust him, and she and Kirk escape and return to the zenite mines. Once there, however, she orders Kirk seized by two other Disruptors. Vanna's friends depart, and she puts Kirk to work digging for zenite. After a short while Kirk attacks her, regains his phaser, and fires at the ceiling of the mine, causing a cave-in that traps them. He then contacts the Enterprise and orders Plasus to be beamed to his location. An indignant Plasus is beamed in, and Kirk forces him and Vanna to dig for zenite. The effects of the zenite gas become apparent as Kirk and Plasus become increasingly irritable. A brawl between them breaks out, and Vanna, finally believing Kirk's story of the gas, signals the Enterprise for help. Back in the city, the zenite consignment is prepared for transport. Plasus has grudgingly allowed the distribution of the filter masks, and Vanna declares that her people's struggle for equality will continue. Production and reception Zack Handlen of The A.V.

Written by Jeremy Tarcher and his wife Shari Lewis and directed by Herb Kenwith, it was first broadcast on January 31, 1969. In the episode, strange incorporeal aliens threaten the Memory Alpha station and the Enterprise. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is en route to Memory Alpha, a planetoid that is home to the Federation's central library. A storm-like phenomenon moving at warp speed is also on course to the planetoid. The Enterprise intercepts the storm, which enters the ship, affecting some crew members' nervous systems. Lieutenant Mira Romaine, who has been assigned to Memory Alpha, faints from the effects of the storm. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy examines Romaine, who seems unresponsive apart from strange grunting sounds. The storm proceeds to Memory Alpha, with the Enterprise in pursuit, and destroys the stations's computer core. Captain Kirk, along with Science Officer Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Mr. Scott beam to the station to inspect the damage. Meanwhile, Romaine has visions of corpses at Memory Alpha. The landing party finds the Memory Alpha's archives seriously damaged, and its staff dead, save one who makes the same guttural noises as Romaine, and dies from what McCoy determines to be a brain hemorrhage. Kirk then has Romaine beamed to the station. She is terrified to see the exact scene from her vision, and then warns that the storm is returning. Scans of the storm determine that it is actually a group of life forms, and Kirk tries to communicate with them through the universal translator, but gets no response. After firing phaser warning shots, Kirk resorts to a full attack, and as the beams strike the storm, Romaine seems to react in pain. Scott, noticing this, begs Kirk to stop the attack. During a discussion in the briefing room, McCoy reports that Romaine's brain wave pattern has been altered, and Spock reveals that the new pattern matches sensor data from the storm. They conclude that the alien life forms are attempting to take control of Romaine's body. To prevent this, they devise a plan to allow the aliens to take partial control and then subject Romaine to high atmospheric pressure. Before they can place her into the pressure chamber, the aliens finally enter Romaine's body, and begin to speak through her, identifying themselves as survivors from the long-dead planet of Zetar. They intend to live out their remaining existence using Romaine's body. With some difficulty, Scott succeeds in getting Romaine into the pressure chamber, and the aliens are eventually driven out and apparently destroyed. With the conclusion of the crisis, Spock, McCoy, and Scott all agree that Romaine is fit to return to duty, with a new assignment to oversee salvaging and repairs of Memory Alpha's archives. Production and reception Episode co-writer Shari Lewis was best known as a children's entertainer, being the original puppeteer of the sock puppet, Lamb Chop. Sequel novel In the non-canon novel, Memory Prime, Romaine participates in a project to rebuild the archives in a more secure structure. The project is soon thrown into turmoil by a murder plot that escalates into a looming crisis that threatens to repeat Memory Alpha's disaster. However, with the aid of the crew of the USS Enterprise, Romaine manages to avert it.

In the episode, a race of aliens from an overpopulated planet abduct Captain Kirk to solve their problem. The episode was co-written by actor Stanley Adams who portrayed Cyrano Jones in the Star Trek episode \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Plot The Federation starship Enterprise arrives at the planet Gideon to discuss diplomatic relations. The Gideons will permit only one representative, Captain Kirk, to set foot on their planet. Kirk beams down to the coordinates provided, but finds himself apparently still aboard the Enterprise, which is now devoid of any crew. First Officer Spock is informed that the Captain has not arrived on the planet, but the Gideon Ambassador, Hodin, refuses to allow a search team to investigate. Neither Starfleet Command nor the Federation bureaucracy is of any help, each referring the matter to the other. Meanwhile, Kirk wanders the deserted corridors and notices a strange bruise on his arm. He eventually encounters a beautiful young woman named Odona. She claims to have no idea how she got there, recalling only that she was in an overcrowded auditorium and struggling to breathe. For the moment, Odona is just relieved to have freedom of movement. Kirk insists that she must be from Gideon, but Odona denies any knowledge of the planet. Kirk learns from Odona that her home planet is severely overpopulated, with crowds of people everywhere and no privacy, because death is rare. To her, the privilege of being alone, even for a moment, is a dream come true. Kirk is taken by Odona's beauty, and the two share a passionate kiss. Neither notice the image of two dozen faces appearing on the view screen behind them. As Kirk and Odona leave the bridge, Kirk hears a strange sound outside the ship. He goes to a viewport and catches a glimpse of a crowd of people looking in. The scene quickly changes to a normal view of space. Kirk confronts Odona about what is going on, but she denies knowing what is happening. She then complains of a strange feeling and faints into Kirk's arms. Kirk carries her to sick bay, where he encounters Ambassador Hodin, who informs him that Odona, his daughter, is suffering from Vegan choriomeningitis, having been infected with Kirk's blood, which carries the virus. Hodin's plan is to infect the Gideon population with the virus, shortening their immense lifespans and relieving the population problem. Kirk is to supply the virus, while Odona's death is to serve as an inspiration for future volunteers. Questioned about alternatives, Hodin explains that the Gideon people's regenerative abilities would foil sterilization attempts, and that other methods of birth control would never be accepted. Having realized that Hodin has deceived him, Spock goes against Starfleet orders and beams down to Kirk's original coordinates. Once there, he finds the false Enterprise that was built to confuse Kirk. He soon reaches Kirk and Odona, and asks Hodin not to interfere as he, Spock, is in enough trouble already. Kirk, Spock, and Odona return to the real Enterprise, where Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy treats Odona's condition. Odona now plans to return to Gideon to supply the virus herself.

Written by Oliver Crawford (based on a story by Gene L. Coon, writing under his pen name ‚ÄúLee Cronin‚Äù) and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast January 10, 1969. In the episode, the Enterprise encounters two survivors of a war-torn planet, each half black and half white, each committed to destroying each other. The episode guest-stars Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is on a mission to help decontaminate the polluted atmosphere of the planet Ariannus, when sensors detect a Federation shuttlecraft that was reported stolen. The craft is brought aboard along with its alien pilot, who identifies himself as Lokai, a political refugee from the planet Cheron. Lokai‚Äôs most striking feature is that his skin is ink-black on one side of his body and chalk-white on the other side. Shortly thereafter, sensors detect another spacecraft in pursuit of the Enterprise. The alien craft disintegrates, but not before its pilot, Bele, transports to the Enterprise bridge. He is colored black and white, similar to Lokai. Bele explains that he is on a mission to retrieve political traitors. His current quarry is Lokai, whom he has been chasing for 50,000 Earth years. Bele is taken to Lokai, and the two begin to argue about the history of their peoples, almost coming to blows. Bele demands that Captain Kirk take him and Lokai to Cheron. Kirk refuses, telling him he will have to make his case to Federation authorities. Some time later, the ship changes course to Cheron, and Bele announces that his \\"will\\" has taken control of the ship. Lokai demands the death of Bele, and Kirk orders both of them to be taken to the brig. Unfortunately, a force field generated by both aliens makes that impossible. With no other way to regain control, Kirk threatens to destroy the Enterprise, and begins the ship‚Äôs auto-destruct sequence. In the last seconds of the countdown, Bele relents, and the ship resumes its course to Ariannus. As Bele continues angrily to press his matter with Starfleet, he reveals the source of his conflict with Lokai. He, and all of his people on Cheron, are black on their right sides, while Lokai's people are all white on their right sides. The distinction is lost on the ship's officers, who leave it for legal authorities at the next starbase to decide, as Starfleet has no extradition treaties with Cheron, and the case requires due process. Once the Ariannus mission is completed, Bele takes control of the Enterprise again, this time disabling the self-destruct system. When the ship arrives at Cheron, Spock can find no sign of intelligent life. Lokai and Bele realize they are each the only ones left of their peoples, who have completely annihilated themselves in civil war. Enraged, they attack each other, their force fields threatening to damage the ship. Lokai breaks away, Bele pursues him, and the two eventually beam down to the planet. The bridge crew remark sadly on their unwillingness to give up their hate. Production The script for the story was developed from a story outline written by Gene L. Coon under his pen name Lee Cronin. This was Gene Coon's final episode. Although Gene Roddenberry liked it, it was initially rejected by NBC studio executive Stanley Robertson. The look of the aliens Bele and Lokai was decided only a week before filming began, based on an offhand comment by director Jud Taylor. The half white-half black makeup led to criticism of the episode as heavy-handed. The script evolved from an outline by Barry TriversDorothy Fontana to Gene Roddenberry, September 28, 1966, Gene Roddenberry Star Trek Television Series Collection, 1966-1969, Box 19, Folder 11, University of California at Los Angeles Library. Dorothy Fontana‚Äôs assessment of the script ‚ÄúPortrait in Black and White‚Äù September 28, 1966 for a possible first season episode called \\"A Portrait in Black and White\\". The script was accepted for the third season following budget cuts. \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" is significant in the Star Trek universe for the first appearance of a self-destruct system (as opposed to an improvised self-destruction process). It did not originate the concept, which appeared previously in the film Forbidden Planet (1956), but the self-destruct system has appeared as a plot device in many subsequent Star Trek stories. Reception In 2010, SciFiNow ranked this the ninth best episode of the original series. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C+\\" rating, noting positively the aliens' makeup and some \\"good moments\\", but also noting that these were outweighed by an overpowering message. In their compendium of Star Trek reviews, Trek Navigator, Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross both rated the episode as mediocre, describing its message as obvious and heavy-handed. They did find some redeeming moments, such as the climactic chase to the ruined planet's surface and Gorshin's performance as Bele. This episode is noted as one of the top ten Star Treks that takes on the topic of tolerance. In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter rated \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" the 11th best television episode of all Star Trek franchise television shows prior to Star Trek: Discovery including live-action and animated series but not counting the movies. A 2016 article in The New Yorker noted that this episode was a dramatization about slavery and racism. In 2017, ScreenRant ranked \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" the 7th most optimistic episode of Star Trek television, pointing out the crew's reaction at the end. In 2016, SyFy ranked guest stars Frank Gorshin and Lou Antonio (as Bele and Lokai, the black and white aliens), the 10th best guest stars on the original series. In 2018, Collider ranked this episode the 12th best original series episode. In 2018, PopMatters ranked this the 19th best episode of the original series.

Written by John Meredyth Lucas (based on a story by D.C. Fontana under the pseudonym Michael Richards) and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast January 24, 1969. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise visit an abandoned planet guarded by a mysterious woman. Plot The Enterprise discovers a planet whose young age is inconsistent with its atmosphere and biology. As Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, Lt. Sulu and geologist D'Amato beam down, a woman appears in the transporter room, touches the transporter technician, and kills him instantly. As the landing party materializes, the surface of the planet is rocked by a violent tremor. Communication with the Enterprise is lost, leaving them stranded. At the same time, the Enterprise finds itself 990.7 light years from the planet. First Officer Spock orders the Enterprise back to the planet. Dr. M'Benga determines the cause of the transporter officer's death to be cellular disruption. The landing party splits up and explores their surroundings. As D'Amato surveys a rocky area, he comes face-to-face with the woman who appeared in the transporter room. After listing off his name and professional record, she says, \\"I am for you,\\" and touches D'Amato, killing him. A failed attempt to cut a grave for D'Amato proves that the planet is artificial. The woman appears to Sulu and attempts to touch him, but only brushes his shoulder with her fingertips. Sulu's screams of pain bring Kirk and McCoy, who find him injured but alive. The woman touches Kirk's shoulder without effect. They conclude that she can only kill the person she specifically names. Chief Engineer Scott, sensing something wrong, orders Engineer Watkins to check equipment in a secluded area. The mysterious woman appears, kills Watkins, and disappears again. The ship begins to accelerate uncontrollably, and Scott discovers the emergency overload bypass has been sabotaged. Scott estimates that the ship will explode in 15 minutes if not brought back under control. Spock suggests manually cutting the matter-antimatter fuel flow to the warp engines. Scott begins the procedure as the Enterprise passes warp 13.2. Scott stops the matter‚Äìantimatter flow at the last second, and the ship continues its course to the planet. On the planet, the woman appears again, announcing she is \\"for Kirk\\", but Sulu and McCoy block her path. Questioned by Kirk, the woman says she is Losira, the station commander. She is alone, and her only purpose is to defend the planet from intruders. Kirk's questions unsettle her and she vanishes. Strong power emanations lead the landing party to a hidden entrance in a rock face. Passing into the hidden chamber, the landing party find a glowing computer. Three copies of Losira enter, one each for Kirk, Sulu, and McCoy. As they approach, Spock and a security officer materialize, and, at Kirk's command, destroy the computer. The three Losiras vanish. A projected image of Losira then appears on a wall, informing her fellow Kalandans that a disease has killed the station's personnel, and that the computer has been defending the station against intruders. McCoy surmises that the disease eventually wiped out the entire Kalandan species, and Spock suggests that the computer used images of Losira to do the job of defense. Kirk concludes that the landing party survived because the reproductions were so perfect that they experienced regret about killing. Production The original story outline was written by D.C. Fontana under the pseudonym Michael Richards. In this outline called \\"Survival\\", Losira is more brutal, encouraging the crew to turn on each other and fight. Reception In a 2010 review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B. He found the stranding of the landing party a refreshing predicament for the series, and praised the depiction of both Spock's strengths and weaknesses as a commander, but questioned why the planet's defense system was so needlessly aggressive, and said the ending is an unsatisfying info-dump.

The route is the only signed four-digit state road in Florida. The route connects US 1, and the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike by proxy, in Florida City with the Everglades National Park, acting as the park's primary mode of entry. The road continues on from its western terminus at the national park's entrance as Main Park Road for another , providing access to many of the park's facilities and the ghost town of Flamingo, in Monroe County, at its western end. Route description Florida State Road 9336, located in Florida City, Florida. It is the highest- numbered state road in Florida. The Florida Department of Transportation states that SR 9336 begins at the entrance to the Everglades National Park. Heading northeast from there, SR 9336 is known as the Ingraham Highway as it travels through rural south-western Miami-Dade County as a two-laned road. Just before crossing the Aerojet canal, SR 9336 turns east and continues through farmland, turning again to the northeast after approximately . After crossing another canal, the Ingraham Highway turns east once more and becomes more urban, passing by a housing estate. At its eastern end, outside the Dade Correctional Institution and just over from its western terminus, SR 9336 reaches a four-way stop intersection and continues north out of it along Tower Road. Although SR 9336 travels through farmland for the next , the surroundings become more urbanised as it approaches West Palm Drive where, at another four-way stop intersection, SR 9336 travels east along that road. Here, SR 9336 enters Florida City, and enters suburbia after one block east along West Palm Drive, continuing eastwards past shops, churches and schools. Through Florida City, it acts as the city's grid plan's latitudinal baseline. At 6th Avenue, West Palm Drive becomes a divided four-laned road, and remains as such for the rest of its journey. later, after passing the Florida City City Hall, the southern terminus of the South Miami-Dade Busway and more shops, SR 9336 intersects with Krome Avenue (SR 997). One block east of SR 997, and now designated as East Palm Drive, SR 9336 terminates at US 1. West of SR 9336's western terminus, Main Park Road extends for another to Flamingo, through various ecosystem areas of the Everglades National Park. East of SR 9336's terminus, East Palm Drive (also known as Southwest 344th Street) extends along the former SR 906 towards the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Biscayne National Park and the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station. History The Old Ingraham Highway was little more than a flood-ridden boggy trail through the Everglades. Excluding the easternmost two blocks, SR 9336 was (with SR 997) part of the former SR 27, which connected Flamingo in the Everglades to US 27. The easternmost two blocks consisted of the former SR 906, which continued to Biscayne National Park. The designation was changed in the early 1980s because of confusion between the state road and the U.S. Highway. Main Park Road, formerly the Ingraham Highway in its entirety, began construction in 1915 to connect Florida City to Flamingo, then a town on the shores of Florida Bay, primarily by using the spoil from dredging the Homestead Canal beside the road. The road had reached as far as Paradise Key, now the Royal Palm area of the Everglades National Park, when it was dedicated with the Royal Palm State Park on November 23, 1916 as the Ingraham Highway, and named for James E. Ingraham, the president of the Model Land Company and vice- president of the associated Florida East Coast Railway. Construction of the road continued west of Paradise Key, and was hampered by difficulties such as subaqueous caverns and the onset of the First World War, with only about built by December, 1917. After the designation of the Everglades National Park in 1947, the SR 27 designation was removed and a detour was created north onto higher ground, as the road was prone to flooding during periods of high water, with portions of the old road re-purposed as park trails or removed. The creation (and refilling) of the canal, as well as digging and blocking culverts under the road have affected flows of fresh and salt water within this part of the Everglades National Park.

It was his last book, and one of his five personal favorites.https://web.archive.org/web/20080216071439/http://zelazny.corrupt.net/phlog44rzint.txt The book is divided in 32 chapters, each representing one \\"night\\" in the month of October (plus one \\"introductory\\" chapter). The story is told in the first- person, akin to journal entries. Throughout, 33 full-page illustrations by Gahan Wilson (one per chapter, plus one on the inside back cover) punctuate a tale heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft. The title is a line from Edgar Allan Poe's \\"Ulalume\\" and Zelazny thanks him as well as others ‚Äì Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Bloch and Albert Payson Terhune ‚Äì whose most famous characters appear in the book. A Night in the Lonesome October was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1994. A similar theme of conflict surrounding the opening of a gate to another world exists in Zelazny's novel Madwand. Plot summary A Night in the Lonesome October is narrated from the point-of-view of Snuff, a dog who is Jack the Ripper's companion. The bulk of the story takes place in London and its environs, though at one point the story detours through the dream-world described by Lovecraft in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Though never explicitly stated, various contextual clues within the story (the most obvious of which being the appearance of Sherlock Holmes or \\"The Great Detective\\") imply that it takes place during the late Victorian period. The story reveals that once every few decades when the moon is full on the night of Halloween, the fabric of reality thins and doors may be opened between this world and the realm of the Great Old Ones. When these conditions are right, men and women with occult knowledge may gather at a specific ritual site to hold the doors closed, or to help fling them open. Should the Closers win, then the world will remain as it is until the next turning... but should the Openers succeed, then the Great Old Ones will come to Earth, to remake the world in their own image (enslaving or slaughtering the human race in the process). The Openers have never yet won. These meetings are often referred to as \\"The Game\\" or \\"The Great Game\\" by the participants, who try to keep the goings-on secret from the mundane population. The various \\"Players\\" during the Game depicted in the book are archetypal characters from Victorian Era gothic fiction ‚Äì Jack the Ripper (only ever referred to as \\"Jack\\"), Dracula (\\"The Count\\"), Victor Frankenstein (\\"The Good Doctor\\"), and the Wolf Man (known as \\"Larry Talbot\\", the film character's name) all make appearances. In addition, there is a Witch (\\"Crazy Jill\\"), a Clergyman (Vicar Roberts), a Druid (\\"Owen\\"), a \\"Mad Monk\\" (\\"Rastov\\" ‚Äì apparently modeled after Rasputin), and Hermetic occultists (\\"Morris and McCab\\" ‚Äì often mentioned as a reference to a real hermetic of the time, MacGregor Mathers). Each Player has a familiar ‚Äì a bestial companion with near-human intelligence that helps complete the numerous preparations for the ritual. The majority of the story describes the interactions and discussions of these familiars, all from Snuff's point of view. Throughout the book, the Players slowly take sides, form alliances, make deals, oppose one another, and even kill off their enemies. The plot accelerates until the night of October 31, when the rite takes place and the fate of the world is decided.

Available English translations include: Dialogues in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu by Herman Bernstein, and The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu by John S. Waggoner. Known life Dialogue aux enfers, 1864 Most of the known information about Monsieur Joly is based upon his autobiographical sketch Maurice Joly, son pass√©, son programme, par lui-m√™me, written at Conciergerie prison in November 1870, where he was jailed for assault at H√¥tel de Ville in Paris. Some additional facts are mentioned at Henry Rollin's book L'Apocalypse de notre temps, and in Maurice Joly, un suicid√© de la d√©mocratie - a preface to modern publication of Joly's Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu, √âpilogue and C√©sar - by mysterious F. Leclercq. Joly was born in the small town of Lons-le-Saunier, in the department of Jura, to a French father and an Italian mother. He studied law in Dijon, but stopped in 1849 in order to go to Paris, where he worked as a clerk at various governmental institutions for about 10 years. He successfully completed his legal studies and was finally admitted to the Paris bar in 1859. He started writing in 1862, supplying literary portraits of his fellow lawyers to a small magazine \\"Gorgias\\", and later published these sketches as a stand- alone book Le Barreau de Paris, followed by Les Principes de 89 and Suppl√©ment √† la g√©ographie politique du Jura. Then Joly concocted a lampoon C√©sar, where he attacked the political regime of Napoleon III, a.k.a. Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte. The books were printed by Martin-Beaupr√© brothers and swiftly destroyed by the publishers. Not a single copy survived. In 1864, Joly wrote his best-known book, The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, a satirical attack on Bonaparte's authoritarianism, and a defense of republicanism.The piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer Lucian and introduced into the French belles- lettres by Bernard de Fontenelle in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of Niccolo Machiavelli and Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Br√®de et de Montesquieu meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way, Joly tried to conceal a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule. Joly relates, in his 1870 autobiography, that one evening thinking of Abb√© Galiani's treatise Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds and walking by Pont Royal, he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu (whom Joly consigned to Hell in his book because of Montesquieu's support of republics/democracies) would make the case for liberalism; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for despotism. Machiavelli claims that he \\"... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia.\\" Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: \\"...Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need\\" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims \\"Eternal God, what have you permitted!...\\" The book was published anonymously (with the by-line par un contemporain, by a contemporary) in Brussels in 1864 and smuggled into France for distribution, but the print run was seized by the police immediately upon crossing the border. The police swiftly tracked down its author, and Joly was arrested. The book was banned. On 25 April 1865, he was sentenced to 18 months at the Sainte-P√©lagie Prison in Paris. The second edition of \\"The Dialogues\\" was issued in 1868 under Joly's name. This time, it reached the readers. But its author remained in obscurity. He established a new journal, Le Palais, that ended after a confrontation with the principal collaborator in the enterprise. After the fall of the Empire in 1870, Joly sought a governmental position from Jules Gr√©vy. He failed in this too. Campaigning against Napoleon III at the 1870 French constitutional referendum, Joly wrote an epilogue to his \\"Dialogue\\". It was published in Le Gaulois and La Cloche magazines. In 1871, he was a low- rank member of the Paris Commune and in his last years, he joined masonic lodge La Cl√©mente amiti√©. Though Joly gained laurels of a scandalous and bully barrator, he sued 10 newspapers, one after another, either for not accepting his stories or for not publishing news about him. Joly's name was completely forgotten, and in life, he did not attain the glory he so obsessively craved. Joly was found dead on 15 July 1878 in his 5 Quai Voltaire apartment in Paris. The declared cause of his death was gunshot suicide. The exact date of his death remains unknown. Posthumous fame The \\"Dialogue\\" and its author became famous later, inadvertently and for an enigmatic reason. In the beginning of 20th century Joly's book was used as a basis for The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an infamous Russian-made antisemitic literary forgery. There is an abundance of evidence that The Protocols were lavishly plagiarized from Joly's book. In his book Six Walks in the Fictional Woods (1994), Italian writer Umberto Eco claims that in the Dialogue Joly plagiarized seven pages or more from a popular novel Les Myst√®res du peuple by Eugene Sue. Joly is also a character in Eco's novel, The Prague Cemetery. In 2015 one of the streets in Lons-le- Saunier was named Rue Maurice Joly.

He was the original civilian investigator of the Roswell UFO incident. He worked on research and development projects for several large companies. Early life Friedman graduated from Linden High School and the University of Chicago, earning a Bachelor of Science in 1955 and a Master of Science degree in nuclear physics in 1956.Story, Ronald, editor, The Encyclopedia of UFOs; Garden City: Doubleday & Company, Inc, 1980,  Career in nuclear physics  Friedman was employed for 14 years as a nuclear physicist for such companies as General Electric (1956‚Äì1959), Aerojet General Nucleonics (1959‚Äì1963), General Motors (1963‚Äì1966), Westinghouse (1966‚Äì1968), TRW Systems (1969‚Äì1970), and McDonnell Douglas, where he worked on advanced, classified programs on nuclear aircraft, fission and fusion rockets, and compact nuclear power plants for space applications. Since the 1980s, he consulted for the radon-detection industry. Friedman's professional affiliations included the American Nuclear Society, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and AFTRA. UFO investigations and advocacy In 1970, Friedman left full-time employment as a physicist to pursue the scientific investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Since then, he gave lectures at more than 600 colleges and to more than 100 professional groups in 50 states, 10 provinces, and 19 countries outside the US. Additionally, he worked as a consultant on the topic. He published more than 80 UFO-related papers and appeared on many radio and television programs.Friedman, S. (2008). Flying Saucers and Science: A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs. Franklin Lakes, NJ: New Page Books He also provided written testimony to Congressional hearings and appeared twice at the United Nations.Aldrich, Jan L. (2002-08). Sign Historical Group - SYMPOSIUM ON UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS - HEARINGS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND ASTRONAUTICS - U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. August 2002. Retrieved from http://www.project1947.com/shg/symposium/shgintro.html. Friedman consistently favored use of the term \\"flying saucer\\" in his work, saying \\"Flying saucers are, by definition, unidentified flying objects, but very few unidentified flying objects are flying saucers. I am interested in the latter, not the former.\\" Friedman used to refer to himself as \\"The Flying Saucer Physicist\\", because of his degrees in nuclear physics and work on nuclear projects. Friedman's positions regarding UFO phenomena Friedman was the first civilian to document the site of the Roswell UFO incident, and supported the hypothesis that it was a genuine crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.Berliner, D. & Friedman, S.T. (2004). Crash at Corona: The U.S. Military Retrieval and Cover-up of A UFO. Cosimo, Inc. , In 1968 Friedman told a committee of the United States House of Representatives that the evidence suggests that Earth is being visited by intelligently controlled extraterrestrial vehicles. Friedman also stated he believed that UFO sightings were consistent with magnetohydrodynamic propulsion. In 1996, after researching and fact checking the Majestic 12 documents, Friedman said that there was no substantive grounds for dismissing their authenticity.Friedman, S.T. (1996). Top Secret/MAJIC: Operation Majestic-12 and the United States Government's UFO Cover-Up. New York: Marlowe & Company. In 2004, on George Noory's Coast to Coast radio show, Friedman debated Seth Shostak, the SETI Institute's Senior Astronomer. Like Friedman, Shostak also believes in the existence of intelligent life other than humans; however, unlike Friedman, he doesn't believe such life is now on Earth or is related to UFO sightings. Friedman hypothesized that UFOs may originate from relatively nearby sunlike stars.(p. 217) A piece of evidence that he often cited with respect to this hypothesis is the 1964 star map drawn by alleged alien abductee Betty Hill during a hypnosis session, which she said was shown to her during her abduction. Astronomer Marjorie Fish constructed a three-dimensional map of nearby sun-like stars and claimed a good match from the perspective of Zeta Reticuli, about 39 light years distant. The fit of the Hill/Fish star maps was hotly debated in the December 1974 edition of Astronomy magazine, with Friedman and others defending the statistical validity of the match. SETI Friedman stated strong views against search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) research. Friedman contested the implicit premise of SETI that there has been no extraterrestrial visitation of the planet, because it was his claim that SETI was seeking only signals, not extraterrestrial intelligence or beings. He maintained that the prominence and widespread public claims of those involved with SETI have tended to prevent serious research, including research by journalists, of UFOs.(p. 129) Friedman was a classmate of Carl Sagan at the University of Chicago. Stanton criticized Sagan, a proponent of SETI, for ignoring empirical evidence, such as \\"600-plus unknowns\\" of Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14. Friedman argued that these empirical data directly contradict Sagan's claim in Other Worlds that the \\"reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable\\". Specifically, Friedman referred to a table in Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 that he said \\"shows that the better the quality of the sighting, the more likely it was to be an 'unknown', and the less likely it was to be listed as containing 'insufficient information'\\"(p. 42). Public and scientific opinion Friedman said of the response to his talks, \\"I know that most people are unfamiliar with the several large-scale scientific studies ... because I ask, after I show a slide and ask about each one, 'How many here have read this?' Typically, it is only one or two percent.\\" He said that a talk he gave to Canadian journalists in Saint John, New Brunswick, caused the attitudes of the journalists to change, because \\"... attendees had had no idea there was so much solid information, as opposed to the tabloid nonsense they thought was the primary source of UFO data.\\" (p. 202) Friedman argued that the majority of people believe UFOs exist and at least some groups of scientists do as well. Friedman (2008) referred to the following data in support of his position: *Gallup Polls between 1966 and 1987 asked respondents the question: \\"Are UFOs something real, or just people's imagination?\\" Of those who took a position one way or the other, 61%, 64%, 68%, and 60% took the position they are real in 1966, 1977, 1978, and 1987, respectively. *With respect to scientists, a poll was taken by Industrial Research and Development in 1971 and 1979. Of the respondents who took a position, 64% and 69% stated they believed UFOs either probably or definitely exist. Of this subgroup, 32% and 44% considered their origin to be Outer Space in 1971 and 1979, respectively. Of the rest of this subgroup, approximately half believed them to be natural phenomena and half were \\"undecided\\". *Peter Sturrock also polled the membership of the American Astronomical Society and found that \\"the greater the amount of time one spent on reading UFO-related material, the more likely one is to accept their reality\\" (p. 210). Criticisms and controversies Friedman was outspoken in his articulation of positions and in his criticism of UFO debunkers, often stating he was not an \\"apologist ufologist\\". His positions are regarded as controversial in mainstream science and media, but Friedman claimed to have received little opposition at his many lectures, most of which were at colleges and universities, many to engineering societies and other groups of physicists (p. 24). He had a number of debates in the mainstream media, including one with UFO skeptic Michael Shermer on CNN. Friedman was criticized both by skeptics and other Roswell researchers for taking the position that there are no substantive grounds for dismissing the authenticity of some Majestic 12 documents. Friedman himself was the first to provide evidence that some of the documents are clearly hoaxes. For example, he showed that a supposed memo from Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter to President Truman, dated February 17, 1948, was actually the emulation of a letter from Marshall to Roosevelt that was featured in the book The American MAGIC. Friedman researched the MJ-12 documents since first becoming aware of them from Wiliam Moore and Jaime Shandera in 1984.Top Secret/MAJIC: Operation Majestic-12 and the United States Government's UFO Cover-Up. New York: Marlowe & Company. He addressed criticisms of the original documents in both sources. As an example, Philip J. Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in the Cutler-Twining memo and offered $100, in a challenge to Friedman, for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1000 by Klass. Personal life Friedman was Ashkenazi Jewish. He was married twice. His first wife was Susie Virginia Porter, with whom he adopted three children, but they divorced in April 1974.California, Divorce Index, 1966-1984; Los Angeles April 1974. He had one daughter with his second wife, Marilyn. Friedman relocated to Marilyn's native Fredericton, New Brunswick in the early 1980s. On May 13, 2019, Friedman died of a heart attack at the Toronto Pearson Airport.  Media = Books  * Flying Saucers & Science, June 2008, 320P. * Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience.

Life and career Wegman originally intended to pursue a career as a painter. He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1965 and a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1967. By the early 70s, Wegman's work was being exhibited in museums and galleries internationally. In addition to solo shows with Sonnabend Gallery in Paris and New York, Situation Gallery in London and Konrad Fisher Gallery in D√ºsseldorf, his work was included in such seminal exhibitions as \\"When Attitudes Become Form,\\" and \\"Documenta 5\\" and regularly featured in Interfunktionen, Artforum and Avalanche. While he was in Long Beach, Wegman got his dog, Man Ray, with whom he began a long and fruitful collaboration. Man Ray, known in the art world and beyond for his endearing deadpan presence, became a central figure in Wegman's photographs and videotapes. In 1982, Man Ray died, and was named \\"Man of the Year\\" by the Village Voice. It was not until 1986 that Wegman got a new dog, Fay Ray, and another collaboration began marked by Wegman's extensive use of the Polaroid 20 x 24 camera. With the birth of Fay's litter in 1989, Wegman's cast of characters grew to include Fay's offspring ‚Äî Battina, Crooky and Chundo ‚Äî and later, their offspring: Battina's son Chip in 1995, Chip's son Bobbin in 1999 and Candy and Bobbin's daughter Penny in 2004.

Exhibitions and critical context His work, which includes photography, video, painting and drawing, is held in permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Hammer Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Centre Pompidou and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. His work has also been a popular success, and have appeared in books, advertisements, films, as well as on television programs like Sesame Street and Saturday Night Live. In 2006, Wegman's work was featured in a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Norton Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Addison Gallery of American Art. The show, entitled William Wegman: Funney/Strange, explored 40 years of his work in all mediums.

One of the best known Argentine paleontologists, he has been described by paleontologist Peter Dodson as \\"almost singlehandedly ... responsible for Argentina becoming the sixth country in the world in kinds of dinosaurs\\".Dodson is quoted in Omni, 1993.  Biography  Bonaparte was the son of an Italian sailor, with no close connection to Napoleon's House of Bonaparte. He was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, and grew up in Mercedes, Buenos Aires. Despite a lack of formal training in paleontology, he started collecting fossils with many friends at an early age, and created a museum in their home town. He later became the curator of the National University of Tucum√°n, where he was named Doctor Honoris causa in 1976, and then in the late 1970s became a senior scientist at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales in Buenos Aires. Bonaparte was a two-time Guggenheim Fellow and since the 1970s received periodic funding from the National Geographic Society. He was reportedly hard- working, stubborn, and had a strong personality, even violent.Omni, 1993. He received another honorary degree from the National University of Comahue in 2011. Bonaparte died on 18 February 2020 at age 91.  Career = Discovery of southern diversity  Between 1975 and 1977, Bonaparte worked on excavation of the Saltasaurus dinosaur with Mart√≠n Vince and Juan C. Leal at the Estancia \\"El Brete\\". This find was in 1977 reported in the scientific literature.J. F. Bonaparte, J. A. Salfity, G. Bossi & J. E. Powell, 1977, \\"Hallazgo de dinosaurios y aves cretacicas en la Formaci√≥n Lecho de El Brete (Salta), proximo al limite con Tucum√°n\\", Acta Geol√≤gica Lilloana 14: 5‚Äì17 With fellow-Argentine Jaime Powell, Bonaparte studied the Saltasaurus and discovered that it had armored plates, known as osteoderms, embedded in its skin. Based on this discovery, together with twenty examples of Kritosaurus australis and a lambeosaurine dinosaur found in South America, Bonaparte hypothesized that there had been a large-scale migration of species between the Americas at the end of the Mesozoic period. The supercontinent of Pangea split into Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south during the Jurassic. During the Cretaceous, South America pulled away from the rest of Gondwana. The division caused a divergence between northern biota and the southern biota, and the southern animals appear strange to those used to the more northerly fauna. Bonaparte's finds illustrate this divergence, and caused paleontologist Robert Bakker to dub him the \\"Master of the Mesozoic\\".Bakker is quoted in Omni, 1993.  Philosophy  Bonaparte was for a long time a traditionalist and did not use modern cladistic methods, which apply the principle of parsimony to a vast array of synapomorphies. Partly for this reason, he declined to work on the modern treatise The Dinosauria, published in 1990. However, from 2000 Bonaparte began to use cladograms. For instance his studies of sauropods (e.g., Ligabuesaurus) and proto-mammals from Brazil show cladograms made by himself and co-authors. While he is best known for his dinosaur discoveries, he preferred to study the fossils of mammals. His students included Rodolfo Coria, Luis Chiappe, Fernando Novas, Jaime Powell, Guillermo W. Rougier, Leonardo Salgado, Jorge Calvo,r Sebasti√°n Apestegu√≠a and Agust√≠n Martinelli.  Footnotes  References  * Available here.

He eventually settled in the United States. When Moskowitz appeared at a cafe in New York City in 1908, the New York Times reported that, \\"posters in Yiddish, Italian, Hungarian, and Roumanian announce his presence throughout the length of East Houston Street.\\" That appearance was to be the start of five years of musically touring the United States. He then opened a restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side. In 1943 he moved to Washington, DC, where he played regularly at Michel's French Restaurant near Dupont Circle. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1954. Recordings The one readily available Joseph Moskowitz recording is The Art of the Cymbalom, Rounder CD 1126, 1996. This CD contains recordings Moskowitz made, some with ensembles, spanning the years 1916 to 1953.

He served as State Secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1997 and as United Nations Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator from 2003 to 2006. He has also served as Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Director of Human Rights Watch Europe, director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross and Chair of Amnesty International Norway. Since 2013 he has been Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, and he also holds a post as Professor II at the University of Stavanger.

He was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley ‚Äì where his thesis, contrasting American and Scandinavian diplomatic models, was published as a bookUN humanitarian chief Egeland leaving post at end of year IRIN, 20 November 2006. ‚Äì and a fellow at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and The Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Jerusalem. Career=Early beginnings Egeland began working with Amnesty International while in high school, campaigning for the disappeared in Chile in the 1970s, and at age 19 spent a month working for Catholic relief organization Minuto de Dios with the Motilon tribe in Colombia.Warren Hoge (July 10, 2004), Rescuing Victims Worldwide 'From the Depths of Hell' New York Times.Optimist in a World of Turmoil: An Interview with Jan Egeland Reflection, Yale Divinity School, 2007. Egeland later served as Chair of Amnesty International in Norway, and Vice- Chair of the International Executive Committee of Amnesty International, which he was elected on to at the age of 23, the youngest ever to hold the position. He also worked as Director for the International Department of the Norwegian Red Cross, Head of Development Studies at the Henry Dunant Institute in Geneva and a radio and television international news reporter for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. Egeland first attracted attention as Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross when he pioneered the fight against the proliferation of small arms and joined the international campaign against landmines. With the onset of war in Iraq in 2003, Egeland alerted the international community to the worsening civilian conditions in Baghdad and Basra. Roles in government Egeland's career also includes service to his government as State Secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1990 to 1997. In that capacity, he initiated two Norwegian Emergency Preparedness Systems, which have provided more than 2,000 experts and humanitarian workers to international organizations. During his time in office, Egeland actively participated in a number of peace processes. He co- initiated and co-organized the Norwegian channel between Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1992, which led to the Oslo Accord (Declaration of Principles) of September 1993. He directed the Norwegian facilitation of the United Nations-led peace talks leading up to ceasefire agreement between the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) guerrillas signed in Oslo in 1996. He also led the host delegation when the Ottawa Treaty to ban landmines was successfully negotiated and adopted in Oslo in 1997. Career with the UN After stepping down from his government position, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Egeland as his Special Adviser to Colombia. Egeland served in this role from 1999 until 2002. Egeland assumed his post as the Under-Secretary-General (USG) for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) in August 2003. This position is the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). He was preceded in the post by Kenzo Oshima of Japan. During his time in office, he initiated the global humanitarian reforms that led to the successful Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) in 2005. Egeland focused his efforts in alleviating the needs of this sector of the population in complex emergency situations like the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency in northern Uganda, the Darfur region in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where millions of displaced persons are affected. He has also campaigned for addressing the needs of those affected by natural disasters, like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, as well as raising awareness in issues such as gender mainstreaming, sexual exploitation and violence, and internal displacement.

Political positions In a United Kingdom Channel 4 interview Egeland laid the blame on the crisis in Lebanon on Hezbollah who he said \\"Hide amongst the civilian population and which gives the Israeli air force no choice but to attack civilian structures,\\" though he also has referred to the Israeli strikes as \\"a violation of humanitarian law\\". On 28 July 2006 he proposed a 72-hour cease fire between Israel and Hezbollah in order for emergency relief to move the wounded and get food and medical supplies into the war zone. Israel rejected the proposal, claiming that the humanitarian corridor it opened to and from Lebanon was sufficient for the purpose. Egeland responded that \\"Hizbollah is not necessarily the biggest obstacle to an agreement\\". Israel later agreed to a 48-hour halt of bombing, while reserving the right to take action against targets preparing attacks. In March 2008, Egeland gave a lecture entitled \\"War, Peace and Climate Change: A Billion Lives in the Balance\\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series. Tsunami relief On 27 December 2004, during the initial phase of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake relief effort, Egeland said that \\"Christmas time should remind many Western countries how rich we have become, and if actually the foreign assistance of many countries now is 0.1 or 0.2 percent of their gross national income, I think that is stingy, really.\\" According to Egeland, in his memoir A Billion Lives (2008), this \\"stingy\\" quote was taken out of context by the press as directed at tsunami relief, when in fact Egeland was addressing the long and ongoing drive by the UN for all OECD nations to contribute 0.7% of GNP to humanitarian efforts.Jan Egeland (2008). A Billion Lives. - see Chapter 5 for a lengthy discussion of this incident. Initial response by the White House to Egeland's quote, taken out of context by the press as a direct attack on the United States (which at the time had donated $15 million), was very negative. However, Egeland subsequently clarified his remarks, and all was forgiven, although Egeland became the focus of a negative campaign online. However the \\"stingy\\" quote did in fact help increase the number of donations. Egeland was later quoted as saying that the donations were so large and were coming in so fast that \\"We really have to confirm that we heard right, that the number of zeroes was right.\\" When reviewing the tangible, if non-monetary, assistance of the militaries of the United States, Australia, and other nations in providing disaster relief, Egeland remarked, \\"Those helicopters are worth their weight in gold now.\\" Time magazine would later call Egeland \\"the world's conscience.\\" Lebanese aid In July 2006, Egeland launched a US$150 million aid appeal for Lebanon, following the destruction of parts of Lebanon by Israeli forces and subsequent displacement of many thousands of refugees. Egeland, though critical of Israel, lashed out against Hezbollah in terms that no UN official had dared yet, saying: > Consistently, from the Hezbollah heartland, my message was that Hezbollah > must stop this cowardly blending ... among women and children. I heard they > were proud because they lost very few fighters and that it was the civilians > bearing the brunt of this. I don't think anyone should be proud of having > many more children and women dead than armed men. We need a cessation of > hostilities because this is a war where civilians are paying the price. Gaza violence During a visit to Gaza to survey the damage, Egeland was quoted as saying that the bombing of a power plant would affect schools and hospitals more than the militants. \\"This is very clear, a disproportionate use [of power],\\" Egeland told reporters. \\"Civilian infrastructure is protected. The law is very clear. You cannot have any interpretation in any other way.\\" Syrian Civil War Egeland has chaired the United Nations panel on humanitarian access in the lengthy war in Syria and is currently the UN Senior Advisor for Syria where he has advocated for simultaneous convoy exchanges and medical evacuations.United Nations. (7 December 2017). \\"Children not a ‚Äòbargaining chip‚Äô in tug of war between Syrian parties ‚Äì UN advisor\\". UN News Centre website Retrieved 10 December 2017.Egeland, Jan. (26 December 2016). \\"Escape from Aleppo, at last: Jan Egeland\\". USAToday website Retrieved 10 December 2017. Publications In 1989, Egeland wrote Impotent Superpower -- Potent Small State in which he portrayed Norway, which at the time devoted the highest percentage of its money to development of any country in the world, as a moral entrepreneur. In 2008 he published a memoir A Billion Lives: An Eyewitness Report from the Frontlines of Humanity about his time at the UN from 2003‚Äì2006.David Jones (November 29, 2008), Politics and religion Financial Times. Criticism Egeland has been criticized for the way he handles relief programs. In 2007, the Norwegian TV channel TV2 aired a documentary entitled De hvite hjelperne (The white helpers) with footage and research from Malawi concerning the Norwegian Red Cross's donation of hundreds of Norwegian army surplus M621 trucks. The documentary highlighted the trucks' primitive construction and poor condition, and general uselessness to the Malawi community. Although Egeland and the Red Cross declared this operation a success, the trucks were little more than scrap metal. In March 2008, TV2 aired another documentary entitled Sultbl√∏ffen (The famine scam) about the 2005‚Äì06 Niger food crisis. Then-UN relief coordinator Egeland and several others were accused of bluffing and of blowing the situation out of proportion. Recognition=Awards * 2005 ‚Äì Peer Gynt Prize * 2008 ‚Äì Four Freedoms Award Other accolades In 2006, Time magazine named Egeland one of the 100 \\"people who shape our world\\". In 2012, the Norwegian group Ylvis produced a parody/tribute rock song about Jan Egeland, hailing him as \\"the United Nations superhero man\\" and \\"a peacekeeping machine.\\" Egeland's response, in an e-mail to NPR, was \\"I think it is hilarious with its crazy text and great tune.\\" As of June 2020, the video has been viewed more than 18 million times, perhaps helped by people learning of Ylvis from their internet sensation \\"The Fox\\". Personal life Egeland was married to former Norwegian Minister of International Development Anne Kristin Sydnes, and has two daughters.

They are an important food for many birds and fish, and some are cultured and harvested for use as fish food. There are 300 species spread across 8 families. Description The body of a fairy shrimp is elongated and divided into segments. The whole animal is typically long, but one species, Branchinecta gigas does not reach sexual maturity until it reaches long, and can grow to long. The exoskeleton is thin and flexible, and lacks any sign of a carapace. The body can be divided into three distinct parts (tagmata) ‚Äì head, thorax and abdomen. Head Drawing of the head of Chirocephalus diaphanus (Chirocephalidae), showing the first antenna (A1), second antenna (A2) and frontal appendage (Ap) The head is morphologically distinct from the thorax. It bears two compound eyes on prominent stalks, and two pairs of antennae. The first pair of antennae are small, usually unsegmented, and uniramous. The second pair are long and cylindrical in females, but in males they are enlarged and specialised for holding the female during mating. In some groups, males have an additional frontal appendage. Thorax and abdomen Male (top) and female (bottom) Eubranchipus grubii (Chirocephalidae): the female is holding eggs on her genital appendages. The thorax of most anostracans has 13 segments (19 in Polyartemiella and 21 in Polyartemia). All but the last two are very similar, with a pair of biramous phyllopods (flattened, leaf-like appendages). The last two segments are fused together, and their appendages are specialised for reproduction. Most anostracans have separate sexes (gonochorism), but a few reproduce by parthenogenesis. The abdomen comprises 6 segments without appendages, and a telson, which bears two flattened caudal rami or \\"cercopods\\". Internal anatomy The head contains two digestive glands and the small lobate stomach that they empty into. This is connected to a long intestine, which terminates in a short rectum, with the anus located on the telson. The haemocoel of anostracans is pumped by a long, tubular heart, which runs through most of the animal's length. A series of slits allow haemocoel into the heart, which is then pumped out of the anterior opening by peristalsis. The nervous system consists of two nerve cords which run the length of the body, with two ganglia and two transverse commissures in most of the body segments. Gas exchange is thought to take place through the entire body surface, but especially that of the phyllopodia and their associated gills, which may also be responsible for osmotic regulation. Two coiled glands at the bases of the maxillae are used to excrete nitrogenous waste, typically in the form of urea. Most of the animal's nitrogenous waste is, however, in the form of ammonia, which probably diffuses into the environment through the phyllopodia and gills. Ecology and behaviour Anostracans inhabit inland waters ranging from hypersaline lakes to lakes that are almost devoid of dissolved substances; they are \\"the most archetypal crustaceans\\" in ephemeral waters. The relatively large size of fairy shrimp, together with their slow means of locomotion, makes them an easy target for predatory fish and waterfowl. This has led to their distribution being restricted to environments with fewer predators, such as vernal pools, salt lakes and lakes at high altitudes or latitudes. The southernmost recorded fairy shrimp is Branchinecta gaini from the Antarctic Peninsula, while the altitude record is held by B. brushi, which lives at in the Chilean Andes. Other genera, such as Streptocephalus, occur in deserts throughout the world. Anostracans swim gracefully by movements of their phyllopodia (thoracic appendages) in a metachronal rhythm. When swimming, the animal's ventral side is normally uppermost (often described as swimming \\"upside-down\\"). They filter food indiscriminately from the water as they swim, but also scrape algae and other organic materials from solid surfaces, for which they turn to have their ventral side against the food surface. Another important aspect of the fairy shrimp‚Äôs life cycle is their universal ability to enter diapause, a state of biological dormancy where growth and metabolism are arrested, as an egg (or cyst). This trait assists in both species' dispersal and in overcoming adverse environmental conditions. Once dormant, these cysts can withstand conditions as harsh and diverse as droughts, frosts, hypersalinity, complete desiccation, exposure to UV radiation and the vacuum of space. It is also the only way for the fairy shrimps to colonize new habitats‚Äîfacilitated by a variety of conditions including wind, predators, currents‚Äîas the soft-bodied adults are unable to leave the freshwater system. Once in diapause, these cysts can remain viable for centuries, and the mixing of system sediment results in the hatching of different aged cysts in each generation. This inbreeding slows the rate of selection by resisting gene flow and minimizing phenotypic variation, in turn promoting the stability of the existing, successful phenotype. Anostracans are an important food source for many birds and fish. For example, they provide much of the food for female pintails and mallards in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Great Plains in North America, especially in years when temporary wetlands are abundant. Similarly, Artemia forms an important part of the diet of flamingos wherever it can be found. Uses Redwood City on San Francisco Bay: the orange colour is produced by the presence of Artemia. Brine shrimp are used as food for fish and other organisms in aquaria and aquaculture. Their drought-resistant eggs are collected from lakeshores and are stored and transported dry. They hatch readily when submerged in salt water. This is a multimillion-dollar industry, centred on the Great Salt Lake in Utah and San Francisco Bay in California; adults are collected from Mono Lake and transported frozen. Fossil record and evolution Fairy shrimp are believed to have diverged from the main line of Branchiopoda during the Ordovician period, around the same time it is thought they colonized freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. This transition is believed to have been the result of selection pressure to escape predation in the Early Paleozoic seas. Some studies point to fossils resembling fairy shrimp in the Upper Cambrian, specifically the oldest known branchiopod fossil, Rebachiella kinnekullensis, from Orsten marine deposits. Despite its seeming resemblance to modern fairy shrimp, this fossil is still considered by most to be an outlying member of the ancestral marine Branchiopoda rather than a true fairy shrimp. The monophyly of this order is well supported, and the scientific community has reached consensus that Anostraca was the first group to branch off from the Branchiopoda. The radiation hypothesis championing rapid spread and colonization during the Gondwana fragmentation closely echoes the current distribution of the order. Presently, Anostraca are found on all seven continents. Most of the extant genera have restricted geographical distributions. Only three genera are widespread across the remnants of the former supercontinent Pangaea: Artemia, Branchinella and Branchinecta, while the remaining genera are found only throughout former Laurasia. This suggests that much of the potential habitat in this supercontinent, now occupied by Anostraca, to have been unoccupied by ecologically similar species, or to have been inhabited by species with less adaptive ability. Studies have found Anostraca capable of rapid colonization and speciation. Diversity Anatomical drawings of Branchinecta paludosa (Branchinectidae) from Georg Ossian Sars' Fauna Norvegiae (1896) Anostraca is the most diverse of the four orders of Branchiopoda. It comprises around 300 species, grouped into 26 genera in eight families: *Artemiidae ‚Äì 1 genus, 9 species *Branchinectidae ‚Äì 1 genus, 45 species *Branchipodidae ‚Äì 5 genera, 35 species *Chirocephalidae ‚Äì 9 genera, 81 species *Parartemiidae ‚Äì 1 genus, 13 species *Streptocephalidae ‚Äì 1 genus, 56 species *Tanymastigidae ‚Äì 2 genera, 8 species *Thamnocephalidae ‚Äì 6 genera, 62 species ReferencesExternal links Crustacean orders Freshwater crustaceans Extant Ordovician first appearances ","title":"Anostraca"},{"id":"1340063","text":"National Heroes of Nepal ‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§∞‡•Ç) is a list of Nepalese people, that also includes those from ancient or medieval times, who were selected to their ranks posthumously by a commission headed by famous writer Balkrishna Sama who was appointed by the King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, in 1955.

She had attempted to climb Mount Everest three times before, but did not succeed until April 22, 1993, when she reached the summit by the South Col via the Southeast Ridge route. The morning of April 22, 1993 was bright and clear, and remained so until Pasang reached the top of the 8,848 m. peak with five Sherpas, Sonam Tshering Sherpa, Lhakpa Norbu Sherpa, Pemba Dorje Sherpa and Dawa Tashi Sherpa. Meanwhile, a member of the team and five-time Everest summitter Sherpa Sonam Tshering got seriously sick at south summit and, despite Pasang Lhamu's efforts to help, did not survive his illness. While descending from the summit, the weather, as often happens in the mountains, suddenly turned bad, causing her to lose her own life on the south summit. Vladas Vitkauskas helped move her body down the mountain. For achieving what no other Nepalese woman had achieved before her, Pasang Lhamu was posthumously honored by her country and mountaineers all around the world in various ways. She was the very first woman to be decorated with the \\"Nepal Tara (Star)\\" by the King of Nepal. The National Youth Foundation conferred the 1993-94 Youth Excellence Award on her. Similarly, in order to commemorate her feat, a life-size statue of Pasang Lhamu was erected at Bouddha, Chuchepati; a postage stamp was issued in her name; the Government of Nepal renamed Jasamba Himal (7,315 m) in the Mahalangur Range as Pasang Lhamu Peak; the Ministry of Agriculture named a special strain of wheat as Pasang Lhamu wheat; the Pasang Lhamu Memorial Hall was established in Dhulabari of Jhapa district in east Nepal; and the 117 km Trishuli-Dunche road was named the Pasang Lhamu Highway.

As a player, Ponson stood at 6'1\\" tall and weighed 260 pounds. He threw right-handed with a fastball that clocked out at 95 mph. When he made his major league debut for the Orioles in , he became the third player from Aruba to play in the major leagues. After the season, he was decorated with an Order of Orange-Nassau, in the grade Knight, along with fellow former Baltimore Orioles players Eugene Kingsale and Calvin Maduro.FORMER BEARS AND OTHER BASEBALL LUMINARIES CONGREGATE ON ARUBA FOR CHARITY SOFTBALL Baltimore Orioles Ponson played most of his career with the Baltimore Orioles. His best season came in when he went 14‚Äì6 with a 3.77 ERA. Because Baltimore was not in contention for a playoff spot and Ponson was in the last year of his contract, the Orioles traded Ponson that season to the San Francisco Giants at the trading deadline for three players: Kurt Ainsworth, Damian Moss, and prospect Ryan Hannaman. That offseason, Ponson returned to the Orioles on a three-year, $22.5 million deal. In , Ponson was the opening day starter for Baltimore. However, he started off disastrously; his record was 3‚Äì12 by the All-Star Break. He rebounded for a strong second half, going 8‚Äì3 to finish with an 11‚Äì15 record and a 5.30 ERA. Brushes with the law On December 25, 2004, Ponson was arrested in Aruba and charged with assaulting an Aruban judge following an incident about a complaint of Ponson's handling of his powerboat. He spent 11 days in jail, but the charges were dropped after he reached a settlement that included restitution, community service and contributions to local charities on the island. Less than a month later, in January 2005, he was charged with driving under the influence in Broward County, Florida. Because of these activities, it was thought that he would not be able to enter Canada to pitch in a series against the Toronto Blue Jays in May . However, a visa was later granted, and he was able to make his scheduled start. Early in the morning of August 25, 2005, Ponson was arrested again for driving under the influence and driving while impaired on southbound Interstate 95 near downtown Baltimore. He was stopped for following too closely and was subsequently arrested by Maryland Transportation Authority Police for the traffic violation and DWI; he was later released. Released by the Orioles Just prior to the second drunk driving incident, Baltimore attempted to trade Ponson to the San Diego Padres for first baseman Phil Nevin at the 2005 trade deadline, but the deal fell through when Nevin invoked his no-trade clause. Nevin eventually was traded to Texas.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2114965 On September 1, 2005, the Orioles released Ponson and voided his contract, saying that his infractions with the law went against a morals clause in Major League Baseball contracts. A week later, on September 8, the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf. The Orioles settled the grievance in 2009, with the Orioles reportedly agreeing to pay the remaining $10.1 million.http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090316&content;_id=4000090&vkey;=news_bal&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=bal St. Louis Cardinals On December 21, 2005, Ponson signed a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals calling for a $1 million salary with the ability to earn an additional $1.5 million in incentives. Although his season started promisingly, Ponson struggled with stamina and rarely went more than five innings in his starts. On July 7, , the Cardinals designated Ponson for assignment, ending his stint with the team. New York Yankees On July 14, 2006, he signed on with the New York Yankees. The Yankees won his first game, lost the second game, and he was subsequently sent to the bullpen when the Yankees acquired Cory Lidle from the Philadelphia Phillies. Reportedly, Brian Cashman asked Ponson if he would be amenable to being placed in the pen before going ahead with the trade (which also involved acquiring Bobby Abreu). If Ponson had refused, he would have been released and the trade that sent Shawn Chac√≥n to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Craig Wilson would have fallen through.Kepner, Tyler. \\"Waiting Game Works to Yankees‚Äô Advantage\\" New York Times (August 1, 2006) After a poor pitching performance on August 18, 2006, the Yankees released Ponson, making him a free agent. Minnesota Twins In January , he signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins and on March 31, 2007, his contract was purchased by the Twins and he was added to their 25-man roster as the fifth starter. He got off to a relatively slow start, having only a couple of quality starts while his ERA hovered around 7. On May 13, the Twins designated him for assignment,Thesier, Kelly. \\"Twins designate Ponson for assignment\\" MLB News (May 13, 2007) and he was later released. Texas Rangers On March 9, , Ponson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. Ponson began the 2008 season with the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks. On April 26, the Rangers purchased his contract, and he became the team's third starter. Ponson compiled a fairly solid 4‚Äì1 record and 3.88 ERA for the season, and was one of the few bright spots on a dreadful rotation. However, he ran into trouble off the field. He was seen late at night in the hotel bar in St. Petersburg, Florida while the Rangers were visiting Tampa Bay. The next day, the Rays lit him up for 12 hits in five innings. Rangers officials told Ponson that any further incident would result in him being dropped from the team. He was pulled four innings into a June 4 game against Cleveland, and reacted angrily, especially since three errors led to four runs. The next day, he blew up at manager Ron Washington after being told he'd be pushed back from his next start to keep Kevin Millwood on his regular schedule. On June 6, Texas abruptly designated Ponson for assignment for what general manager Jon Daniels called \\"disrespectful and adverse reactions to situations unbecoming of a teammate.\\" Daniels added, \\"We don't feel Sidney deserves to be here or wants to be here. We're not going to get into details other than to say we're clearly trying to put together a team here, in a true sense of the word. Based on some recent comments and other such things, it was pretty clear that he did not want to be part of that, and it's something we're not going to tolerate.\\" Return to the Yankees On June 9, 2008, Ponson signed a minor league deal returning to the Yankees for a second time. He made his first start on June 27, 2008 in a Subway Series against the Mets. Ponson pitched 6 shutout innings in his first start back with the Yankees, which they eventually won 9‚Äì0. His record with the Yankees in 2008 was 4‚Äì4 with a 5.85 ERA. For the season, he had the highest run support of all pitchers, with an average of 6.5 runs per game started.https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-starter- pitching.shtml World Baseball Classic Ponson pitched for the Netherlands in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Ponson would finish with an ERA of 4.00 in nine innings pitched over two appearances, earning the win for the Dutch in their shocking opening win over the heavily favored Dominican Republic. He was, however, the losing pitcher in the Dutch's second-round defeat to Venezuela. On June 26, 2009, it was announced that he violated the IBAF/World Anti-Doping Agency doping regulation during the 2009 World Baseball Classic by taking phentermine, and was banned from international baseball tournament for two years. He was allowed to play professionally in the US, however, since the American association does not validate the European laboratory results. Kansas City Royals On March 17, 2009, two days after Netherlands' elimination from the World Baseball Classic, Ponson signed a minor league deal to play for the Kansas City Royals and was invited to spring training.Royals sign veteran Ponson to minor-league deal On April 10, , the Royals purchased Ponson's contract and he made his debut the same day against the New York Yankees. He pitched six innings, and gave up four earned runs for the loss. He made his second start for the Royals on April 15, in which he allowed only two runs in six innings. Ponson got a no decision in the 5‚Äì4 loss to the Cleveland Indians.Ponson, Ramirez round out KC rotation After a record of 1‚Äì7 with an ERA of 7.36, he was designated for assignment by the Royals on August 2, and released August 12.

By 604 AD Sivadeva was reduced to a mere figurehead by Amshuverma within years of his appointment as Samanta, a feudal lord. His rule appears to have ended before 621 AD when crown prince Udayadev became King. Amshuverma took the title of Pashupati Bhattarak being in Shaivite majority period. The meaning of Sanskrit word Bhattaraka is noble lord.R. Ghose (1966), Saivism in Indonesia during the Hindu-Javanese period, The University of Hong Kong Press, pages 16, 123, 494-495, 550-552 He is believed to have been a son of a brother of the queen of Sivadeva. He was learned, bold and farsighted ruler of Lichhavi period, he was also a lover of art, architecture and literature. He built Kailashkut Bhawan palace, which became famous as a state of the art palace south of the Himalayas in the seventh century. The Chinese ambassador Wang Huen Che who was appointed about 640 AD makes a graphic description of its grandeur in Tang Annals of China. The appointment of the Chinese ambassador to the court of Nepal in seventh century shows that a very close relationship pertained between Nepal and China already. Many Tibetan accounts make Bhrikuti the daughter of Amshuverma. If this is correct, the marriage to Songts√§n Gampo must have taken place sometime before 624 CE.Ancient Tibet: Research materials from the Yeshe De Project, p. 225 (1986). Dharma Publishing, Berkeley, California. . Acharya Kirti Tulku Lobsang Tenzin, however, states that Songst√§n Gampo married Bhrkuti Devi, the daughter of king \\"Angsu Varma\\" or Amshuvarma (Tib: Waser Gocha) of Nepal in 632.Tenzin, Ahcarya Kirti Tulku Lobsang. \\"Early Relations between Tibbet and Nepal (7th to 8th Centuries).\\" Translated by K. Dhondup. The Tibet Journal, Vol. VII, Nos. 1 &2\\\\. Spring/Summer 1982, p. 85. According to some Tibetan legends, however, a Nepali king named Go Cha (identified by Sylvain L√©vi as \\"Udayavarman\\", from the literal meaning of the Tibetan name) was said to have a daughter called Bri-btumn or Bh·πõkuti.Shaha, Rishikesh. Ancient and Medieval Nepal. (1992), p. 18. Manohar Publications, New Delhi. . \\"Udayavarman\\" was most likely the same king we know as Udayadeva, the son of ≈öivadeva I and later, the adopted son and heir to A·πÉshuvarmƒÅ. He was also thought to be the father of Narendradeva (Tib: Miwang-Lha).Shaha, Rishikesh. Ancient and Medieval Nepal. (1992), p. 17. Manohar Publications, New Delhi. . If this is accepted, it means that Narendradeva and Bhrikuti Devi were brother and sister. It is believed that Udayadev was exiled to Tibet and the daughter of Udayadev, Bhrikuti, was married to the Tibet Emperor Tsrong-tsang Gompo. This event appears to have opened trade routes between Nepal and Tibet. Some early historians in Nepal had mistakenly concluded that the pictographic symbol used to name the father of Bhrikuti in Tang Annals stood for Amshu (which means the rays of the rising sun in Sanskrit, the language used in Nepal then), where as Udaya (the rise of the sun) would also be written with the same symbols. Bhrikuti could not have been Amshuverma's daughter simply because she would be too old to marry the Tibet Emperor. Bhrikuti was daughter of Udayadev and she had dispatched the Tibetan army to Nepal valley to reinstate Narendradev, her brother, as king in Nepal about 640 AD. Bhrikuti was instrumental in spreading Buddhism to Tibet and she later attained the status of Tara, the shakti in Mahayana Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who visited India during the 7th century, described A·πÉshuvarmƒÅ as a man of many talents. The original temple of Jokhang in Lhasa was modeled after a Nepali monastery design - a square quadrangle with the kwa-pa-dyo shrine at the center of the east wing, opposite to the entrance. The innermost shrine room of the world heritage Jokhang temple still displays the woodwork of Nepali origin and craftsmanship. Since then, and specially after the contributions of Araniko, a Nepali bronze caster and architect, sent to Tibet to cast a stupa in 1265 AD, Nepali art and architecture spread over the countries like China and Japan. An inscription by A·πÉshuvarmƒÅ dated to 607 AD at Tistung professes the importance of the \\"Aryan code of conduct\\" (i.e. the caste system). A great feat of architecture and engineering, the Kailashkut Bhawan, is believed to have been located about Hadigaun in Kathmandu. It had three courtyards and seven storied tiered structure with grand water works and inlay stone decorations. Amshuverma also introduced the second Licchavi era (samvat). Economically, Nepal was much developed during his time. His ruling period is known as the 'Golden Period' in the history of Nepal. Life Amshuverma also married his sister Bhoga Devi to an Indian king, Sur Sen, and this marriage helped him strengthen relationship with India. He maintained the independence and sovereignty of Nepal by his successful foreign policy. His Sanskrit grammar, entitled Shabda Vidya, made him popular even outside the nation. The famous Chinese traveller Huen Tsang praised him in his travel account. Amshuverma's regime became a boon to the Licchavi Period so that it came to be called a golden age. He has become immortal in the history of Nepal. Most of the inscriptions of king Shivadeva first , there is the name of Amshuverma as Srimahasamanta. In the later period of king Shivadeva, Amshuverma coupe and declare himself sovereign ruler. King Shivadev first ran away from the palace with his family to neighboring country Tibet because they were all Buddhist kings and very close in trade relation. when they were in Tibet for several years Shivadev's daughter Virkuti got married with Tibetain prince. King Shong Chog Gombus second wife was daughter of Tang king Taizong. At that period Amshuverma changed three different positions: Shri- mahsamanta from a seven storied building Kailashkut royal palace at Hadigaon, Shree Amshuverma issued the crescent symbolic coins minted in his name, Sri-maharajadhiraja from the last time of his rule. In one inscription issued by his queen, king Amshuverma is addressed as Sri-kalhabhimani (lover of the goddess of wealth and state prosperity). The work Shabdavidya (grammer) is the literary creation of king Amshuverma in his 26 years of ruling period. He adored his clan as Bappa-pada- nudhyat (blessed by predecessors). Sources of the family of Amshuverma are silent and there was marital relation between the Deva and Verma clans. Amshuverma was the man of diplomatic experiments and a successful political benefiter to exploit the situation to grab state power at any means. He welcomed scholars in his state and was in favor of local self-government for welfare of the people. Nepal had trade relation with Tibet and the items were Iron, yak tail, wool, musk deer pod, copper utensils and herbs etc. were exchanged. In 618AD there was economic relation with Tibet and Tibet started to encroach towards Nepal when it absorbed more power which is noticed by the Gopalaraj Vamsavali. In the south, Nepal had trade as well as diplomatic relations with Bidharvaraj Harshaverdhan, was a powerful king of Kanauj. Prince Surasen of Kanauj, (Maukhari clan) was the sister in-law of Amshuverma. When Harshaverdhana captured and annexed Kanauj, Surasena came to Nepal and bikramsen was Sarvadandanayak of Amshuvermas court. Amshuverma did not continue his dynastic rule because he was succeeded by Udayadeva, the son of king Shivadeva 1st . Udayadeva son of king Shivadeva got help from Tibetain king (Brother in law) with armies and forced Ansuvarma to leave the thrown but he was dethroned by his younger brothers Dhrubadeva and Bhimarjundeva and after Dhrubadeva Jishnu Gupte, a chief of Abhir dynasty occupied the throne. But the throne of Abhir dynasty could not run for long time.Nepal was vassal state of Tibet for several centuries until the rise of Genesis Khan.  Personality  Amshuverma had been acknowledged as a person of talents devoted to the study of the Sastras.

In his reign, a certain Bibhubarma Rajbansi, or descendant of a Rajah, having consecrated a Buddha, built an aqueduct with seven spours, and wrote the following on the right hand side of one of them, \\" By the kindness of Amshuverma, this aqueduct has been built by Bibhubarma , to augment the merit of his father. \\" Pilgrimage Amshuverma was endowed with all the kingly qualities and virtues. He was a just, impartial and an able administrator. He was a true servant of the people without any political bias. According to some inscriptions, King Shiva Deva used to say that Amshuverma was a man of universal fame and he always destroyed his enemies by his heroic nature. Some other inscriptions tell us that he had a great personality, who dispelled darkness by the light of his glory. Huen Tsang, himself a learned man and respected scholar, writes about him as a man of high accomplishments and great glory. Amshuverma had written a book on grammar in Sanskrit. The great grammarian Chandraverma, a scholar of Nalanda University, was patronized by him. He followed Shaivism but was tolerant towards all other religions. He can rightly be compared with other great rulers of his time as regards his political outlook and impartial feelings without any religious prejudices. For the development of economic condition of the people he paid great attention to the improvement of trade and commerce of the country. Nepal had trade relations with India, Tibet and China and became the thoroughfare of India's trade with China and vice versa. Amshuverma gave equal importance to industrial advancement and agricultural prosperity. He made every effort to help the people by providing canals to irrigate the fields. He levied a water tax, a land tax, a defense tax and a luxury tax, using the income from these sources for the development works of the country and not for his personal pleasure and luxury.  Death  Amshuverma died at any time between Savmat 43-47, i.e., 619-623 C.E.

Prosopographical research has the goal of learning about patterns of relationships and activities through the study of collective biography; it collects and analyses statistically relevant quantities of biographical data about a well-defined group of individuals. The technique is used for studying many pre-modern societies. The nature of prosopographical research has developed over time. In his 1971 essay, Lawrence Stone discussed an \\"older\\" form of prosopography which was principally concerned with well- known social elites, many of whom were already well-known historical figures. Their genealogies were well-researched, and social webs and kinship linking could be traced, allowing a prosopography of a \\"power elite\\" to emerge. Prominent examples which Stone drew upon were the work of Charles A. Beard and Sir Lewis Namier. Charles Beard's An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913) offered an explanation of the form and content of the U.S. Constitution by looking at the class background and economic interests of the Founding Fathers. Sir Lewis Namier produced an equally influential study of the 18th century British House of Commons, and inspired a circle of historians whom Stone light-heartedly termed \\"Namier Inc.\\" Stone contrasted this older prosopography with what in 1971 was the newer form of quantitative prosopography, which concern was with much wider populations including, particularly, \\"ordinary people\\". An example of this kind of work, published slightly later, is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's pioneering work of microhistory, Montaillou: The Promised Land of Error (1978), which developed a picture of patterns of kinship and heresy, daily and seasonal routine, in a small Occitan village, the last pocket of Cathars, over a 30-year period from 1294 to 1324. Stone anticipated that this new form of prosopography would become dominant as part of a growing wave of Social Science History. But prosopography and other associated forms of social science and quantitative history went into a period of decline during the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, perhaps because of developments in computing, and particularly in database software, prosopography was revived. The \\"new prosopography\\" has since become clearly established as an important approach in historical research. A certain mass of data is required for prosopographical research.The classic early example of prosopography was the series of volumes of Prosopographia Imperii Romanae, edited by P. von Rohden and H. Dessau, (Berlin), appearing from 1897, which amassed a database covering the governing class of the Roman Principate. The collection of data underlies the creation of a prosopography and, in contemporary research, this is usually in the form of an electronic database. But data assembly is not the goal of the research; rather, the objective is to understand patterns and relationships by analysing the data. A uniform set of criteria needs to be applied to the group in order to achieve meaningful results. And, as with any historical study, understanding the context of the lives studied is essential. In the words of prosopographer Katharine Keats-Rohan, \\"prosopography is about what the analysis of the sum of data about many individuals can tell us about the different types of connection between them, and hence about how they operated within and upon the institutions‚Äîsocial, political, legal, economic, intellectual‚Äîof their time\\".Keats-Rohan, Katharine. \\"Prosopography and computing: A marriage made in heaven?\\" History and Computing. 12.1, p. 2. . In this sense prosopography is clearly related to, but distinct from, both biography and genealogy. Whilst biography and prosopography overlap, and prosopography is interested in the details of individuals' lives, a prosopography is more than the plural of biography. A prosopography is not just any collection of biographies‚Äîthe lives must have enough in common for relationships and connections to be uncovered. Genealogy, as practiced by family historians, has as its goal the reconstruction of familial relationships, and as such, well-conducted genealogical research may form the basis of a prosopography, but the goals of prosopographical research are generally wider. History British historian Lawrence Stone (1919‚Äì1999) brought the term to general attention in an explanatory article in 1971.Lawrence Stone, \\"Prosopography\\", Daedalus 100.1 (1971), pp. 46‚Äì71. . The word is drawn from the figure of prosopopeia in classical rhetoric, introduced by Quintilian, in which an absent or imagined person is figured forth‚Äîthe \\"face created\\" as the Greek suggests‚Äîin words, as if present. Stone noted two uses of prosopography as an historian's tool: first, in uncovering deeper interests and connections beneath the superficial rhetoric of politics, in order to examine the structure of the political machine; and second, in analysing the changing roles in society of particular status groups‚Äîholders of offices, members of associations‚Äîand assessing social mobility through family origins and social connections of recruits to those offices or memberships. \\"Invented as a tool of political history,\\" Stone observed, \\"it is now being increasingly employed by the social historians.\\"Stone 1971:47.

He is one of the National heroes of Nepal. He was highly praised for his military skill for the defence of the Nalapani fort in the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814‚Äì1816). He was CaptainThe use of English terms for their grades of command was common in the Nepalese army, but the powers of the different ranks did not correspond with those of the British system. The title of General was assumed by Bhimsen Thapa, as Commander-in-chief, and enjoyed by himself alone; of Colonels there were three or four only; all principal officers of the court, commanding more than one battalion. The title of Major was held by the adjutant of a battalion or independent company; and Captain was the next grade to colonel, implying the command of a corps.

Name His given name Balabhadra is the name of Baladeva (Balarama), the elder brother of Krishna. It is an amalgamation of two words; Bala () and Bhadra () Family and Early life  He was born to father Chandrabir Kunwar, a resident of Bhanwarkot of Panchkhal Municipality in Kavrepalanchowk District. His mother Ambika Devi was a sister of Kaji Ranajor Thapa and daughter of Bada Amar Singh Thapa. His father Chandrabir was son of Jaya Krishna Kanwar, a son of Ashiram Kanwar. His brother Birabhadra Kunwar was military commander in Kumaun and Kangra front (1809 A.D.) as well as governor of Garhwal.  The Anglo-Nepal War 1814‚Äì1816  Balbhadra Kunwar As commander of the Gorkhali forces in Dheradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar was handed the responsibility of defending the area. The expanding Nepali/Gorkhali State had since the mid-late 18th century expanded the nation's border on all sides, which eventually led to conflict with the British East India Company and a war followed. Realizing he could not defend the town of Dehradun, Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar withdrew to the strategic hill fort of Khalanga with an army strength of 600 including women and children against the British East India Company British stronghold of 3000‚Äì3500 troops. He turned down an incentive proposal of the British who would make him Governor of the Western Garhwal should he surrender or leave Nepal. In the month of October 1814, Major General Sir Rollo Gillespie of the British army had advanced along with 3,500 troops and eleven pieces of cannon to occupy the Nepali territories situated between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in the Gharwal and Kumaon regions that had been occupied by the Nepali forces. Captain Balabhadra Kunwar had maintained his position at a 400 cubits high hill in a place called Nalapani, situated north- east of Dehradun, to check his advance. On Kartik 8, 1871, Bikram Samvat (October 1814), British troops reached Dheradun. A battle took place between British and Nepali troops at Nalapani on Kartik 10, 1871 B. Samvat. The British were unsuccessful and withdrew to Dehradun. Another battle was fought between the two sides at Nalapani on Kartik 17, 1871 Samvat (ca. Oct 31, 1814). General Gillespie, the British Commander, lost his life in that battle along with Col. Alice. The siege continued for a month until the British, convinced that they could not win by military ways, blocked the source of water to the fort so that the Nepalese would die of thirst. For the Nepali Army it was a hard struggle fighting a very well equipped and trained modern army, belonging to one of the largest colonial Empires of the world. Balbhadra Kunwar had asked for reinforcements from the capital but Kathmandu could not send them any soldiers as the Nepali army had no reserve army and were an emerging power which means that they did not have troops to match the East India Company. The Nepalese army was outnumbered in Nalapani as it was in every battlefield. Even though the Nepali army lacked water they were still determined to defend their position. Because the walls had collapsed, cannonballs fired by the British started reaching the interior of the fort. Many men were killed or injured. Despite losing their comrades and friends the remaining men were still determined to defend their position. In order to drink water from the river they came out of the fort in a single line, and the British forces watched in surprise as the Nepali troops quenched their thirst and returned to their fort. On Marga 16 (Nov 1814), four of the commanders, including Capt. Balabhadra Kunwar, in the night was forced to abandon the fort of Nalapani with their remaining Gorkhali troops. On seeing the Nepalis abandon the fort, the British attacked them. The Nepalis resisted the attack but continued to advance. They reached Dwara in the morning of Marga 17, 1871 and stayed the whole day there. Balabhadra sent a courier to the British with the following message: We had handed over to you your dead and injured soldiers on your request. We now request you to hand over our injured soldiers to us. The British replied that they would look after the injured (Nepali) soldiers themselves. Accordingly, they treated the 180 injured soldiers at the Nalapani fort. The next day, Marga 18, 1871 Samvat, the Nepalis left Dwara for the Gopichand Hill, where they had decided to build a fort. Dwara was not considered suitable for that purpose. The Nepalis spent the night at the Gopichand hill. At midnight, the British forces started shelling their camp. The Nepalis retaliated. Meanwhile, Sardar Ripumardan Thapa sustained an injury in his right arm from an enemy shell. He was unable to walk, and so was helped by his jamadar to climb the hill. However, he could not go on and was forced to stop. The other Nepalis continued to ascend the hill. The next day, Marga 19, 1871 B. Samvat, men sent by Balabhadra carried Ripumardana to Chamuwa. Kaji Ranadipa Simha Basnyat also had arrived at that place. On Marga 20, Kaji Rewanta Kunwar reached there Subedar Dalajit Kanwar were killed by enemy fire. Ultimately after 4 days of thirst, and a severe loss of troops, without surrendering, Capt. Balbhadra emerged from the fort with drawn kukris in his hands (along with other 70 survivors) and roared to the British ‚Äì \\"You could have never won the battle but now I myself voluntarily abandon this fort. There is nothing inside the fort other than dead corpses of the children and women\\"! He and his remaining troops escaped into the hills on November 30, 1814. A peace treaty was signed on Dec 2, 1815 between the then King Girvan Yuddha Vikram Shah and the British East India Company, known as the Sugauli Treaty. Later life He did not lose his life during the Anglo-Nepalese war. After the war, he went to Lahore, capital of the Punjab where many Nepalis had gone, to join the two new regiments formed by the Sikh Maharajah/King Ranjit Singh of the Punjab, following the war with the British but a tradition formed prior to the war. Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar was appointed General and commander of the new \\"Lahure\\" regiments consisting entirely of Gorkhali/Nepali troops. Those that had taken service under the Mughal Emperors were known as \\"Munglane\\" and was seen as less prestigious and unclean. After the Anglo- Nepalese war the recruitment of Gurkhas/Gorkhas started in the British-India Army (Army of British East India Company) and has continued until today in both the modern Indian and British Army; the Gorkha Regiments (India) and the Royal Gurkha Rifles (UK). During the Sikh-Afghan war of 1879 B. Samvat (1822), the Nepalis in the Sikh Military had fought bravely, but was also in which Balabhadra Kunwar was killed by Afghan artillery in Naushera, Peshawar region, Afghanistan on Chaitra 3 (March/April in the Roman calendar and is the last month in the Hindu Lunar calendar). Bhimsen Thapa had sent men to Lahore to collect information about this war and the death of his nephew. Following the Anglo-Nepali War, the British East India Company erected a war memorial at Nalapani in honor of the Gorkhalis and Capt. Balbhadra Kunwar (often referred to wrongly as Bulbuder Singh or Balbudder Thapa) praising their bravery.

The Southern Alps have been uplifted on the fault over the last 12 million years in a series of earthquakes. However, most of the motion on the fault is strike-slip (side to side), with the Tasman district and West Coast moving North and Canterbury and Otago moving South. The average slip rates in the fault's central region are about 38mm a year, very fast by global standards. The last major earthquake on the Alpine Fault was in c. 1717 AD, the probability of another one occurring within the next 50 years is estimated at about 30 percent.  Geographic extent and plate motion  alt= The Pacific Plate and Indo-Australian Plate boundary forms the Macquarie Fault Zone in the Puysegur Trench off the southwestern corner of the South Island and comes onshore as the Alpine Fault just north of Milford Sound. The Alpine Fault then runs the length of the South Island just west of the Southern Alps to near Lewis Pass in the central northern section of the island. At this point it splits into a set of smaller faults known as the Marlborough Fault System. This set of faults, which includes the Wairau Fault, the Hope Fault, the Awatere Fault, and the Clarence Fault, transfer displacement between the Alpine Fault and the Hikurangi subduction zone to the north. The Hope Fault is thought to represent the primary continuation of the Alpine Fault. The Indo-Australian Plate is subducting towards the east south of the South Island and the Pacific Plate is subducting towards the West to the north. In the middle the Alpine Fault is a transform boundary and has both dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip movement and uplift on the southeastern side. The uplift is due to an element of convergence between the plates, meaning that the fault has a significant high- angle reverse oblique component to its displacement. The Alpine Fault has the greatest uplift near Mt Cook in its central section. Here the relative motion between the two plates averages 37‚Äì40 mm a year. This is distributed as 36‚Äì39 mm of horizontal and 6‚Äì10 mm upwards movement on the fault's plane per year.  Geological origin and evolution  New Zealand before the activation of the Alpine Fault (30 Ma). Outcrop showing hydrothermally altered alt= Alpine Fault outcrop showing banded alt=Between 25 and 12 million years ago the movement on the proto-Alpine Fault was exclusively strike-slip. The Southern Alps had not yet formed and most of New Zealand was covered in water. Then uplift slowly began as the plate motion became slightly oblique to the strike of the Alpine Fault. In the last 12 million years the Southern Alps have been uplifted approximately 20 kilometres, however, as this has occurred more rain has been trapped by the mountains leading to more erosion. This has along with Isostatic constraints has kept the Southern Alps less than 4000 m. Uplift on the Alpine Fault has led to the exposure of deep metamorphic rocks near the fault within the Southern Alps. This includes mylonites and the Alpine Schist, which increases in metamorphic grade towards the fault. The eroded material has formed the Canterbury Plains. The Alpine Fault is not a single structure but often splits into pure strike-slip and dip-slip components. Also near the surface the fault can have multiple rupture zones.  Fault zone geology  The fault zone is exposed at numerous locations along the West Coast and typically comprises a 10-50 m wide fault gouge zone with pervasive hydrothermal alteration. Most of the movement along the fault occurs in this zone. In outcrop the fault zone is overlain by mylonites which formed at depth and have been uplifted by the fault.  Earthquakes  There have been no major historical earthquakes on the Alpine Fault. Because of this during the mid 20th century it was speculated that the Alpine Fault creeps without making large earthquakes. However, it is now inferred by multiples lines of evidence that the Alpine Fault ruptures creating major earthquakes about every few hundred years.  Prehistoric  The MƒÅori arrived in New Zealand c.1300 but never reached a high population density in the colder South Island. So while earthquakes are an important part of MƒÅori oral tradition, no stories have been passed down about South Island Earthquakes. Over the last thousand years, there have been four major ruptures along the Alpine Fault causing earthquakes of about magnitude 8. These had previously been determined to have occurred in approximately 1100, 1430, 1620 and 1717 CE, at intervals between 100 and 350 years. The 1717 quake appears to have involved a rupture along nearly of the southern two-thirds of the fault. Scientists say that a similar earthquake could happen at any time as the interval since 1717 is longer than between the earlier events. Newer research carried out by the University of Otago and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation revised the dates of the pre-1717 earthquakes to between 1535 and 1596 (instead of 1620), 1374 and 1405 (instead of 1430), and 1064 and 1120 (instead of 1100). In addition, an earlier earthquake was identified to have occurred between 887 and 965.  Historic  There have been no major earthquakes on the Alpine Fault in historic times, its southern and northern offshoots have, however, experienced sizable earthquakes: *1848 ‚Äì Marlborough, estimated magnitude = 7.5 *1888 ‚Äì North Canterbury, estimated magnitude = 7.3 *1929 ‚Äì Arthur's Pass, estimated magnitude = 7.1 *1929 ‚Äì Murchison, estimated magnitude = 7.8 *1968 ‚Äì Inangahua, estimated magnitude = 7.1 * 2003 ‚Äì Fiordland, estimated magnitude = 7.1 *2009 ‚Äì Fiordland, estimated magnitude = 7.8  Prediction of next earthquake  In 2012, GNS Science researchers published an 8000-year timeline of 24 major earthquakes on the (southern end of the) fault from sediments at Hokuri Creek, near Lake McKerrow in north Fiordland. In earthquake terms, the long fault is remarkably consistent, rupturing on average every 330 years, at intervals ranging from 140 years to 510 years. In 2017, GNS researchers revised the figures after they combined updated Hokuri site records with a thousand-year record from another site 20 km away at John O'Groats River to produce a record of 27 major earthquake events during the 8000-year period. This gave a mean recurrence rate of 291 years, plus or minus 23 years, down from the previously estimated rate of 329 years, plus or minus 26 years. In the new study, the interval between earthquakes ranged from 160 to 350 years and the probability of an earthquake occurring in the following 50 years was estimated at 29 per cent.  Projected effects of a rupture  Large ruptures can also trigger earthquakes on the faults continuing north from the Alpine Fault. There is paleotsunami evidence of near-simultaneous ruptures of the Alpine Fault and Wellington (and/or other major) faults to the North having occurred at least twice in the past 1,000 years. A 2018 study says that a significant rupture in the Alpine Fault could lead to roads (particularly in or to the West Coast) being blocked for months, as with the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, with problems in supplying towns and evacuating tourists. District councils along the West Coast and in Canterbury have commissioned studies and begun preparations for an anticipated large earthquake on the Alpine Fault. Earthquake risk zones New Zealand. Until 2011 the lack of earthquakes on the Alpine Fault was interpreted as meaning lower risk.  History of research  In 1940 Harold Wellman found that the Southern Alps were associated with a fault line approximately 650 km (400 miles) long. The fault was officially named the Alpine Fault in 1942 as an extension of a previously mapped structure. At the same time, Harold Wellman proposed the 480 km (300 miles) lateral displacement on the Alpine Fault. This displacement was inferred by Wellman due in part to the similarity of rocks in Southland and Nelson on either side of the Alpine Fault. Lateral displacements of this magnitude could not be explained by pre-plate tectonics geology and his ideas were not initially widely accepted until 1956. Wellman also proposed in 1964 that the Alpine Fault was a Cenozoic structure, which was in conflict with the older Mesozoic age accepted at the time. This idea coupled with the displacement on the fault proposed that the earth's surface was in relatively rapid constant movement and helped to overthrow the old geosynclinal hypothesis in favour of plate tectonics. Richard Norris and Alan Cooper from the Department of Geology, University of Otago conducted extensive research on the structure and petrology of the Alpine Fault respectively throughout the later 20th and early 21st centuries. It was during this time that the cyclicity of the Alpine Fault earthquakes and meaning of the increase in metamorphic grade towards the fault was discovered and refined. Originally this regional increase in grade was inferred to be from frictional heating along the fault not uplift of deeper geological sequences. Richard H. Sibson from the same university also used the Alpine Fault to refine his nomenclature of fault rocks which gained international adherence.  Deep Fault Drilling Project  The Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) was an attempt in 2014 to retrieve rock and fluid samples and make geophysical measurements inside the Alpine Fault zone at depth. It was a $2.5 million international research project designed to drill 1.3 km to the fault plan in two months. The DFDP was the second project to try to drill an active fault zone and return samples after the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth. One of the goals of the project was to use the deformed rocks from the fault zone to determine its resistance to stress. Researchers also planned to install long term equipment for measuring pressure, temperature and seismic activity near the fault zone. It was led by New Zealand geologists Rupert Sutherland, John Townsend and Virginia Toy and involves an international team from New Zealand, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2017 they reported they had discovered beneath Whataroa, a small township on the Alpine Fault, \\"extreme\\" hydrothermal activity which \\"could be commercially very significant\\". One of the lead researchers said that it is likely to be globally unique.

It is also the administrative seat of eponymous division and district. Government of Bangladesh refers to administrative seat of its divisions and districts as headquarters and not as capital. Located on the north bank of the Padma River, near the Bangladesh- India border, the city has a population of over 763,952 residents. The city is surrounded by the satellite towns of Nowhata and Katakhali, which together build an urban agglomeration of about 1 million population. Arguably Rajshahi is the most clean and green among the cities in Bangladesh. Modern Rajshahi lies in the ancient region of Pundravardhana. The foundation of the city dates to 1634, according to epigraphic records at the mausoleum of Sufi saint Shah Makhdum. The area hosted a Dutch settlement in the 18th century. The Rajshahi municipality was constituted during the British Raj in 1876. It was a divisional capital of the Bengal Presidency. Rajshahi is an important administrative, educational, cultural and business centre in Bangladesh today. It is a historic center of silk production. Varendra Research Museum, the oldest of its kind in Bangladesh, is located in the city. The city is home to many renowned educational institutions of Bangladesh. The head office of Rajshahi Agricultural Development Bank and Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) is situated in the city. Rajshahi is served by the Shah Makhdum Airport. History Rajshahi district was a part of the Pundra region of ancient Bengal ruled by the Pundra Kingdom. The capital of Prince Vijaya, the king who led military operations in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia was located to the west of Rajshahi town. In medieval times, the region came to be known as \\"Rampur Boalia\\". The origin of the present name of \\"Rajshahi\\" is debated among scholars. Most say that it takes its name from Hindu Kings and zamindars (or \\"Rajas\\") as Raj and the persianised Shahi; both of which mean \\"royal\\" or \\"kingdom\\". The administrative district was established in 1772 and the municipal corporation in 1876. Rajshahi was dominated by various Maharajas, Rajas and Zamindars. 312x312px During the British raj, it was also known as \\"Beuleah\\" and was the administrative headquarters of Rajshahi district in Eastern Bengal and Assam. It was originally chosen as a commercial factory for the silk trade, which was being officially encouraged by the agricultural department of that time. The town contained a government college, and an industrial school for sericulture. Most of the public buildings were severely damaged by the earthquake of 12 June 1897. Throughout much of the early part of the twentieth century there was a daily steamer service on the Ganges which connected it to rail-heads that led to the then provincial capital of Calcutta as well as other cities in the province of Bengal.

He began his show business career as an usher in a Cleveland theater in 1933. He later became a booking agent for the Music Corporation of America (MCA), founded by Jules Stein. Hollywood career Statue of Wasserman at Universal Studios Florida Under Wasserman, MCA branched out into representing actors and actresses in addition to musicians and in the process created the star system, which drove up prices for studios. MCA struggled to gain ground in Hollywood since major agencies like those belonging to Charles Feldman, Myron Selznick, and Leland Hayward had already grabbed up most of the major talent. However, in the mid-1940s, when it purchased Hayward's agency, MCA finally gained bargaining leverage with the studios. As an agency, Wasserman's MCA came to dominate Hollywood, representing such stars as Bette Davis and Ronald Reagan. Wasserman was an influential player and fundraiser in the Democratic Party, but was also a lifelong and instrumental advocate, mentor, and close friend of Reagan. The Newsmeat Power Rankings identify Wasserman and his close friend Jack Valenti as two of the top five \\"most famous and powerful Americans whose campaign contributions result most often in victory.\\" At MCA Wasserman expanded upon a business practice known as film packaging (a process established by earlier agents like Feldman and Selznick). Since studios reduced output after World War II, they let more actors out of long-term contracts, and big agencies like MCA could then negotiate stronger terms for their clients. Agents like Wasserman would pitch packages, for example a writer client, director client, and actor or actress, to the studios who then needed only to finance it. Agencies, therefore, began doing the job the studios used to in some respects ‚Äì namely, assembling films. Wasserman expanded on practices established by earlier agents. For example, Feldman and Selznick realized in the late 1930s that an actor could pay much less tax by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture the actor appeared in, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income. Wasserman used this tax avoidance scheme with actor James Stewart, beginning with the Anthony Mann western Winchester '73 (1950). This marked the first time an onscreen talent ever received \\"points in the film\\" ‚Äì a business tactic that skyrocketed after Wasserman's negotiation and Stewart's ensuing success. Following the rising postwar popularity of television and the resulting near bankruptcy of many studios, Wasserman purchased Universal Studios and Decca Records in 1962 and merged them with MCA. In 1966, he singlehandedly installed Jack Valenti as head of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). Together they orchestrated and controlled much of how Hollywood operated, and was allowed to do business, for the next several decades. Wasserman ran the combined company for nearly 30 years before selling it to Japanese consumer electronics conglomerate Matsushita Electric in 1990. According to the 2003 book When Hollywood Had a King: The Reign of Lew Wasserman, Who Leveraged Talent into Power and Influence, Wasserman was interested in acquiring The Walt Disney Company in 1984, and this deal came within inches of actually happening: As a tribute to the man who essentially built the park, the New York section of Universal Studios Florida possesses a statue of Wasserman with an accompanying plaque. It is routinely decorated for various events, such as Halloween Horror Nights, and is removed for the Macy's Holiday Parade, as to not interfere with the various balloons. Political Connections According to Dan E. Moldea's survey Dark Victory : Ronald Reagan, MCA, and the Mob (which inspired Clara and Julia Kuperberg's 1986 TV documentary), Wasserman was the link between the Mafia, the Hollywood film industry and Reagan, who obtained very lucrative deals as an actor with Wasserman as his agent. By 1947, just after Al Capone died, and still with the help of his alliance with the underworld, Wasserman was instrumental in helping Reagan to become president of the Screen Actors Guild, which kicked off Reagan's rise to power. Reagan allowed MCA to work both as a producer as well as an agent, which enabled the Mafia to earn a huge income. Last years In 1993, Wasserman created Universal CityWalk and made numerous, substantial changes to the Universal City area. Wasserman pocketed an estimated $350 million from the sale of MCA and remained as manager, but with vastly diminished power and influence, until Seagram bought controlling interest in 1995, which then resulted in his role becoming even more marginalized. Wasserman served on the board of directors until 1998. On September 29, 1995, Wasserman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. In 1996, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. Death Wasserman died of complications from a stroke in Beverly Hills in 2002 and was interred in Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City. He was honored posthumously with the 2,349th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 5, 2007. Personal life Wasserman was married to Edith \\"Edie\\" Beckerman who was also Jewish.The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, McA, and the Hidden History of Hollywood By Dennis McDougal p. 383. They had one child, a daughter, Lynne Kay Wasserman.Jonathan Kandell, \\"Lew Wasserman, 89, Is Dead; Last of Hollywood's Moguls\\", New York Times June 4, 2002.

They changed their name to Myers and had a son Casey Wasserman. This marriage also ended in divorce. Lew Wasserman's grandson, Casey Wasserman, carries on the family name in the agency business, the Wasserman Media Group (WMG), which he started in 1998. He is also acting President and Chief Executive Officer of the Wasserman Foundation, a charitable organization founded by the Wassermans in 1952 in Beverly Hills.Carmel Dagan, \\"Edie Wasserman dies at 95 ‚Äì Was key advisor to husband Lew Wasserman and major player in philanthropy\\", Variety August 18, 2011.

They occurred under water, at the edge of Norway's continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea, approximately 6225‚Äì6170 BC. The collapse involved an estimated length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of of debris, which caused a megatsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean. Description The yellow numbers give the height of the tsunami wave as indicated by tsunamites studied by researchers.P.C. Marrow, \\"Seismic Monitoring of the North Sea\\", Global Seismology Research Group, British Geological Society, HSE, 1992 The three Storegga Slides are considered to be amongst the largest known landslides. They occurred underwater, at the edge of Norway's continental shelf (Storegga is Norwegian for \\"the Great Edge\\"), in the Norwegian Sea, north-west of the M√∏re coast, causing very large tsunamis in the North Atlantic Ocean. These collapses involved an estimated length of coastal shelf, with a total volume of of debris. Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunamis, the latest incident occurred around approximately 6225‚Äì6170 BC. In Scotland, traces of the subsequent tsunami have been recorded, with deposited sediment being discovered in Montrose Basin, the Firth of Forth, up to inland and above current normal tide levels. Possible mechanism A possible triggering mechanism is thought to have been an earthquake physically triggering a catastrophic expansion of methane clathrate. A cubic metre of solid clathrate expands to 164 cubic metres of methane. Another theory is that streams from melting glaciers had carried trillions of tons of sediment to the edge of the continental shelf, and that a trigger such as an earthquake caused a large area of seafloor to collapse into the deep Norwegian sea.Skimming the surface of underwater landslides 2016 Impact on human populations Storegga tsunami deposits (grey upper layer), bracketed by peat (dark brown layers), taken at Maryton on the Montrose Basin, Scotland At, or shortly before, the time of the last Storegga Slide, a land bridge known to archaeologists and geologists as \\"Doggerland\\" existed, linking Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands across what is now the southern North Sea. This area is believed to have included a coastline of lagoons, marshes, mudflats, and beaches, and to have been a rich hunting, fowling and fishing ground populated by Mesolithic human cultures.Bryony Coles, \\"Doggerland Project\\", University of Exeter Department of Archaeology Vincent Gaffney, \\"Global Warming and the Lost European Country\\"Tony Robinson, \\"Britain's Stone Age Tsunami\\", Time Team specials, Channel 4 Television, 30 May 2013 Although Doggerland was permanently submerged through a gradual rise in sea level, it has been suggested that coastal areas of both Britain and mainland Europe, extending over areas which are now submerged, would have been temporarily inundated by a tsunami triggered by the Storegga Slide. This event would have had a catastrophic impact on the contemporary Mesolithic population. Modern day impact As part of the activities to prepare the Ormen Lange natural gas field, the incident has been thoroughly investigated. One conclusion is that the slide was caused by material built up during the previous glacial period and that a recurrence would be possible only after a new ice age. Facts and arguments supporting this conclusion were made public in 2004, and thus it was concluded that the development of the Ormen Lange gas field would not significantly increase the risk of triggering a new slide.

The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection of Christ, as well as red-coloured Easter eggs, symbolizing the\\"blood of Christ\\" shed for the sins of the world, also sit on the table. Eastertide (also known as Eastertime or the Easter season) or Paschaltide (also known as Paschaltime or the Paschal season) is a festal season in the liturgical year of Christianity that focuses on celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It begins on Easter Sunday, which initiates Easter Week in Western Christianity, and Bright Week in Eastern Christianity. There are several Eastertide customs across the Christian world, including sunrise services, exclaiming the Paschal greeting, clipping the church, and decorating Easter eggs, a symbol of the empty tomb. The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection, traditionally serve as the chancel flowers that decorate the chancel area of churches throughout Eastertide. Other Eastertide customs include egg hunting, eating special Easter foods and watching Easter parades. In Western Christianity Eastertide is the period of 50 days, spanning from Easter Sunday to Pentecost Sunday.Normae Universales de Anno Liturgico et de Calendario (NUALC), 22 It is celebrated as a single joyful feast, called the \\"great Lord's Day\\".Saint Athanasius, Epist. fest. I: Patrologia Graeca 26, 1366 Each Sunday of the season is treated as a Sunday of Easter. In some traditions, Easter Sunday is the first Sunday of Eastertide and the following Sunday (Low Sunday) is the second Sunday of Eastertide and so on; in other traditions, following the Sunday of the Resurrection, they are named Second Sunday of Easter, Third Sunday of Easter, etc. up to the Seventh Sunday of Easter, concluding with Pentecost Sunday.NUALC, 23 Easter Sunday and Pentecost correspond to pre-existing Jewish feasts: The first day of Pesach (◊§◊°◊ó) and the holiday of Shavu'ot (◊©◊ë◊ï◊¢◊ï◊™). In the Jewish tradition, the 49 days between these holidays are known as Counting of the Omer (◊°◊§◊ô◊®◊™ ◊î◊¢◊ï◊û◊®). The first eight days constitute the Octave of Easter and are celebrated as solemnities of the Lord.NUALC, 24 Since 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter is also called Divine Mercy Sunday. The name \\"Low Sunday\\" for this Sunday, once common in English, is now used mainly in the Church of England. The solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord is celebrated on the 40th day of Eastertide (a Thursday), except in countries where it is not a Holy Day of Obligation. In such countries it is celebrated on the following Sunday (the 43rd day of Eastertide).NUALC, 25 The nine days from that feast until the Saturday before Pentecost (inclusive) are days of preparation for the Holy Spirit the Paraclete,NUALC, 26 which inspired the form of prayer called a novena. Before the 1969 revision of the calendar, the Sundays were called First Sunday after Easter, Second Sunday after Easter, etc. The Sunday preceding the feast of the Ascension of the Lord was sometimes, although not officially, called Rogation Sunday, and when the Ascension had an octave, the following Sunday was called Sunday within the Octave of the Ascension.Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition When this octave was abolished in 1955, it was called Sunday after the Ascension.1962 Roman Missal Pentecost was followed by an octave, which some reckoned as part of Eastertide. When the Anglican and Lutheran churches implemented their own calendar and lectionary reforms in 1976, they adopted the same shortened definition of the Easter season as the Roman Catholic Church had promulgated six years earlier. In the Church of England, the Easter season begins with the Easter Vigil and ends after Evening Prayer (or Night Prayer) on the Day of Pentecost. Some Anglican provinces continue to label the Sundays between Easter and the Ascension \\"Sundays After Easter\\" rather than \\"Sundays of Easter\\"; others, such as the Church of England and ECUSA, use the term \\"Sundays of Easter\\". Paschal Tide is a season of joy. The colour for the Office de tempore is white; the Te Deum and Gloria are recited every day even in the ferial Office. On Sundays the \\"Asperges\\" is replaced by the \\"Vidi Aquam\\" which recalls the solemn baptism of Easter eve. There is no feast day from Easter until Ascension. The Armenians during this period do away even with the abstinence on Fridays. Prayers are said standing, not kneeling. Instead of the \\"Angelus\\" the \\"Regina Caeli\\" is recited. From Easter to Ascension many churches, about the tenth century, said only one Nocturn at Matins; even some particular churches in the city of Rome adopted this custom from the Teutons (B√§umer, \\"Gesch. des Breviers\\", 312). Pope Gregory VII limited this privilege to the week of Easter and of Pentecost. Some dioceses in Germany however, retained it far into the nineteenth century for 40 days after Easter. In every Nocturn the three psalms are said under one antiphon. The Alleluia appears as an independent antiphon; an Alleluia is also added to all the antiphons, responsories and versicles, except to the versicles of the preces at Prime and Compline. Instead of the \\"suffragia sanctorum\\" in the semidouble and ferial Offices, a commemoration of the Holy Cross is used. The iambic hymns have a special Easter doxology. The feasts of the holy Apostles and martyrs have their own commune from Easter to Pentecost. At Mass the Alleluia is added to the Introit, Offertory and Communion; in place of the Gradual two Alleluias are sung followed by two verses, each with an Alleluia; there is also a special Preface for Paschal Time. Paschal Tide was the period during which every member of the faithful who has attained the year of discretion was bound by the positive law of the Church to receive Holy Communion (Easter duty). During the early Middle Ages from the time of the Synod of Agde (508), it was customary to receive Holy Communion at least three times a year‚ÄîChristmas, Easter and Pentecost. A positive precept was issued by the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) and confirmed by the Council of Trent (Sess. XIII, can. ix). According to these decrees the faithful of either sex, after coming to the age of discretion, must receive at least at Easter the Sacrament of the Eucharist (unless by the advice of the parish priest they abstain for a while). Otherwise during life they are to be prevented from entering the church and when dead are to be denied Christian burial. The paschal precept is to be fulfilled in one's parish church. Although the precept of the Fourth Lateran to confess to the parish priest fell into disuse and permission was given to confess anywhere, the precept of receiving Easter Communion in the parish church was still in force where there are canonically-erected parishes. The term Paschal Tide was usually interpreted to mean the two weeks between Palm and Low Sundays (Synod of Avignon, 1337); by St. Antonine of Florence it was restricted to Easter Sunday, Monday and Tuesday; by Angelo da Chiavasso it was defined as the period from Maundy Thursday to Low Sunday. Eugene IV, 8 July 1440, authoritatively interpreted it to mean the two weeks between Palm and Low Sundays.G. Allmang, \\"K√∂lner Pastoralblatt\\" (Nov., 1910) 327 sq. In later centuries the time has been variously extended: at Naples from Palm Sunday to Ascension; at Palermo from Ash Wednesday to Low Sunday. In Germany, at an early date, the second Sunday after Easter terminated Paschal Tide, for which reason it was called \\"Predigerkirchweih\\", because the hard Easter labour was over, or \\"Buch Sunday\\", the obstinate sinners putting off the fulfillment of the precept to the last day. In the United States upon petition of the Fathers of the First Provincial Council of Baltimore Paschal Tide was extended by Pius VIII to the period from the first Sunday in Lent to Trinity Sunday (II Plen. Coun. Balt., n. 257); in Canada the duration of the Paschal Tide is the same as in the United States. In England it lasts from Ash Wednesday until Low Sunday; in Ireland from Ash Wednesday until the octave of SS. Peter and Paul, 6 July.O'Kane \\"Rubrics of the Roman Ritual\\", n. 737; Slater, \\"Moral Theology\\" 578, 599 Liturgical aspects This tide was called by the older liturgists \\"Quinquagesima paschalis\\" or \\"Quin. laetitiae\\". The octave of Easter which closes after Saturday has its own peculiar Office. Since this octave is part and complement of the Easter Solemnity, Paschal Tide in the liturgical books commences with the First Vespers of Low Sunday and ends before the First Vespers of Trinity Sunday. On Easter Sunday the Armenian Church keeps the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and on Saturday of Easter Week the Decollation of St. John. The Orthodox (Greek) Church celebrates on Friday of Easter Week the feast of Our Lady, the Living Fountain (shrine at Constantinople). The Sundays from Easter to Ascension Day, besides being called the First, Second (etc.) Sunday in Easteride or after Easter Sunday, have their own peculiar titles. =First Sunday=Second Sunday= The second is the Feast of MercyThe Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, also known as \\"Dominica in albis\\", or Low Sunday. In the Dioceses of Portugal and Brazil (also in the ecclesiastical province of St. Louis, Mo.) on the Monday after Low Sunday is celebrated the feast of the Joys or Exultation of Mary at the Resurrection of her Son (double of the second class). The Russians, on Tuesday of this week, celebrating Radonitsa, go in procession to the cemeteries and place Easter eggs on the gravesMaltzew, \\"Fasten-und Blumen- Triodion\\" (Berlin, 1899), 791 =Third Sunday= In the Latin Church the third Sunday is called from its Gospel the Sunday of the Good Shepherd and from the Introit \\"Misericordias Domini\\"; in many dioceses (Seville, also with the order of the Capuchins) it is called the feast of Our Lady Mother of the Good Shepherd (double second class); at Jerusalem and in the churches of the Franciscans it is called the feast of the Holy Sepulchre of Christ; in the Greek Church it is called ion myrophoron (Sunday of the women who brought ointments to the sepulchre of Christ); the Armenians celebrate on this Sunday the dedication of the first Christian church on Mount Sion. =Fourth Sunday= The fourth Sunday of Eastertide is called from the Introit \\"Jubilate\\"; the Latin Church has assigned to it the feast of the Patronage of St. Joseph (double second class); the Greeks call it the Sunday of the Paralytic, from its Gospel. =Fifth Sunday= The Oriental Churches on Wednesday after the third Sunday celebrate with a very solemn Office and an octave, the Mesopentekoste, the completion of the first half of Paschal Tide; it is the feast of the manifestation of the Messiah, the victory of Christ and the Church over Judaism [\\"Zeitschrift f√ºr katholische Theologie\\" (1895), 169-177]; the Slav nations in this day have a solemn procession and benediction of their rivers.Nilles, \\"Kal.\\" II, 361 The fifth Sunday is called Cantate Sunday; by the Orientals it is called Sunday of the Samaritan Woman. =Sixth Sunday= The sixth Sunday, \\"Vocem jucunditatis\\" in the Orient, Sunday of the Man Born Blind. In the Latin Church follow the Rogation Days; in the Greek Church on Tuesday is kept the apodosis or conclusion of the feast of Easter. The Greeks sing the Canons of Easter up to this Tuesday in the same manner as during Easter Week, whilst in the Latin Church the specific Easter Office terminates on Saturday following the feast. Thursday is the feast of the Ascension. The Friday of this week, in Germany, is called \\"Witterfreitag\\"; the fields are blessed against frost and thunderstorms. =Seventh Sunday= Sunday within the octave of Ascension is called \\"Exaudi\\" from the Introit; in some dioceses it is called Feast of Our Lady, Queen of the Apostles (double major) or of the Cenacle (Charleston and Savannah, first class); in Rome it was called Sunday of the Roses (\\"Pascha rosarum\\" or \\"rosatum\\"), since in the Pantheon rose-leaves were thrown from the rotunda into the church; in the Greek and Russian Churches it is the feast of the 318 Fathers of the first Nicene Council; the Armenians call it the \\"second feast of the flowers\\", a repetition of Palm Sunday. By older liturgists the week before Pentecost is called \\"Hebdomada expectationis\\", week of the expectation of the Holy Ghost. On the Vigil of Pentecost the baptismal water is blessed in the Latin Church; in the Oriental Churches it this Saturday is the psychosabbaton (All Soul's Day); on this day the Greeks bless wheat cakes and have processions to the cemeteries. In Eastern Christianity Bright Week procession (Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church in Guslitsa) In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Pascha begins on Easter Sunday at Matins which is normally celebrated at midnight and continues for forty days through the ninth hour on the day before the Ascension.

It was carried out on 14 July 1500, some 50 km to the west of Kaluga, between forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, under command of Prince Konstantin Ostrozhsky and Russian (Muscovite) army under Prince Daniil Shchenya.The Muscovite Dynastic Crisis of 1497-1502, John V.

Vedrosha was a crushing victory for the Russians. Some 8,000 Lithuanians were killed, and many more were taken prisoner, including Prince Konstantin Ostrogski, the first ever Grand Hetman of Lithuania. After the battle the Lithuanians lost the possibility for military initiative and restricted themselves to defensive actions.  Comments by contemporaries  The battle was described by Sigismund von Herberstein in his Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii (1549).

The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), partial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhydrosis (decreased sweating), with apparent enophthalmos (inset eyeball). The nerves of the sympathetic trunk arise from the spinal cord in the chest, and from there ascend to the neck and face. The nerves are part of the sympathetic nervous system, a division of the autonomic (or involuntary) nervous system. Once the syndrome has been recognized, medical imaging and response to particular eye drops may be required to identify the location of the problem and the underlying cause. Signs and symptoms Signs that are found in people with Horner's syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following: *ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) *anhidrosis (decreased sweating) * miosis (constriction of the pupil) * sinking of the eyeball into the face * inability to completely close or open the eyelid *facial flushing *headaches * loss of ciliospinal reflex * bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion. * unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner's syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases. * heterochromia iridum (in congenital Horner's syndrome) Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the dilator muscle and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the superior tarsal muscle which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present. The phenomenon of enophthalmos is seen in Horner's syndrome in cats, rats, and dogs. Sometimes there is flushing on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin. The pupil's light reflex is maintained as this is controlled via the parasympathetic nervous system. In children, Horner's syndrome sometimes leads to heterochromia, a difference in eye color between the two eyes. This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with melanin pigmentation of the melanocytes in the superficial stroma of the iris. In veterinary medicine, signs can include partial closure of the third eyelid, or nictitating membrane. Causes Scheme showing sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the pupil and sites of a lesion in Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is usually acquired as a result of disease, but may also be congenital (inborn, associated with heterochromatic iris) or iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment). In rare cases, Horner's syndrome may be the result of repeated, minor head trauma, such as being hit with a soccer ball. Although most causes are relatively benign, Horner's syndrome may reflect serious disease in the neck or chest (such as a Pancoast tumor (tumor in the apex of the lung) or thyrocervical venous dilatation). Causes can be divided according to the presence and location of anhidrosis: * Central (anhidrosis of face, arm and trunk) ** Syringomyelia ** Multiple sclerosis ** Encephalitis ** Brain tumors ** Lateral medullary syndrome * Preganglionic (anhidrosis of face) ** Cervical rib traction on stellate ganglion ** Thyroid carcinoma ** Thyroidectomy ** Goiter ** Bronchogenic carcinoma of the superior fissure (Pancoast tumor) on apex of lung ** Klumpke paralysis ** Trauma - base of neck, usually blunt trauma, sometimes surgery. ** As a complication of tube thoracostomy ** Thoracic aortic aneurysm * Postganglionic (no anhidrosis) ** Cluster headache - combination termed Horton's headache ** An episode of Horner's syndrome may occur during a migraine attack and be relieved afterwards. ** Carotid artery dissection/carotid artery aneurysm ** Cavernous sinus thrombosis ** Middle ear infection * Sympathectomy * Nerve blocks, such as cervical plexus block, stellate ganglion or interscalene block  Pathophysiology  Horner syndrome is due to a deficiency of sympathetic activity. The site of lesion to the sympathetic outflow is on the ipsilateral side of the symptoms. The following are examples of conditions that cause the clinical appearance of Horner's syndrome: *First-order neuron disorder: Central lesions that involve the hypothalamospinal tract (e.g. transection of the cervical spinal cord). *Second-order neuron disorder: Preganglionic lesions (e.g. compression of the sympathetic chain by a lung tumor) that releases acetylcholine. *Third-order neuron disorder: Postganglionic lesions at the level of the internal carotid artery (e.g. a tumor in the cavernous sinus or a carotid artery dissection) that releases norepinephrine. *Partial Horner's syndrome: In case of a third- neuron disorder, anhidrosis is limited to the middle part of the forehead or can be absent, resulting in a partial Horner's syndrome. If patients have impaired sweating above the waist affecting only one side of the body, and they do not have clinically apparent Horner's syndrome, then their lesions are just below the stellate ganglion in the sympathetic chain. Diagnosis Left- sided Horner's syndrome in a cat as a result of trauma, demonstrating miosis in left pupil. Three tests are useful in confirming the presence and severity of Horner syndrome: * Cocaine drop test: Cocaine eyedrops block the reuptake of post-ganglionic norepinephrine resulting in the dilation of a normal pupil from retention of norepinephrine in the synapse. However, in Horner's syndrome the lack of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft causes mydriatic failure. A more recently introduced approach that is more dependable and obviates the difficulties in obtaining cocaine is to apply the alpha-agonist apraclonidine to both eyes and observe the increased mydriatic effect (due to hypersensitivity) on the affected side of Horner syndrome (the opposite effect to what the cocaine test would produce in the presence of Horner's). * Paredrine test: This test helps to localize the cause of the miosis. If the third order neuron (the last of three neurons in the pathway which ultimately discharges norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft) is intact, then the amphetamine causes neurotransmitter vesicle release, thus releasing norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft and resulting in robust mydriasis of the affected pupil. If the lesion itself is of the third order neuron, then the amphetamine will have no effect and the pupil remains constricted. There is no pharmacological test to differentiate between a first and second order neuron lesion. * Dilation lag test It is important to distinguish the ptosis caused by Horner's syndrome from the ptosis caused by a lesion to the oculomotor nerve. In the former, the ptosis occurs with a constricted pupil (due to a loss of sympathetics to the eye), whereas in the latter, the ptosis occurs with a dilated pupil (due to a loss of innervation to the sphincter pupillae). In a clinical setting, these two ptoses are fairly easy to distinguish. In addition to the blown pupil in a CNIII (oculomotor nerve) lesion, this ptosis is much more severe, occasionally occluding the whole eye. The ptosis of Horner syndrome can be quite mild or barely noticeable (partial ptosis). When anisocoria occurs and the examiner is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, if a one-sided ptosis is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be presumed to be on the side of the ptosis. History It is named after Johann Friedrich Horner, the Swiss ophthalmologist who first described the syndrome in 1869. Several others had previously described cases, but \\"Horner's syndrome\\" is most prevalent. In France and Italy, Claude Bernard is also eponymized with the condition (\\"Claude-Bernard-Horner syndrome\\", abbreviated \\"CBH\\"). In France Francois Pourfour du Petit is also credited with describing this syndrome.  Children  The most common causes in young children are birth trauma and a type of cancer called neuroblastoma. The cause of about a third of cases in children is unknown.

The show was hosted by Jack Clark, with Jerri Fiala as hostess. Announcing duties were handled by John Harlan, Jay Stewart, and Jerry Bishop. The show was produced by Ralph Edwards Productions and distributed by Metromedia Producers Corporation. A second version began airing on September 8, 1986, titled The All-New Crosswits, and was hosted by David Sparks with Michelle Roth as announcer. This version was produced by Crossedwits Productions in association with Outlet Communications, Inc., and distributed by ABR Entertainment. Both versions were produced as daily shows, although the original Cross-Wits aired in many markets as either a once- or twice-weekly series. Main game Two teams, each consisting of two celebrities and one contestant, competed to solve clues to crossword puzzles. Each word in the puzzle was also a clue to a master puzzle. 1975‚Äì80 version Logo for the 1975‚Äì80 version of The Cross-Wits. The category of the master puzzle was given at the beginning of each round. The contestant captain chose which position in the crossword puzzle to identify, and which star to play that position. A crossword clue to that word was then read. If the star couldn't answer the clue within seven seconds, the contestant could answer. However, if neither the celebrity nor the contestant answered correctly, control passed to the opposing team. Each correct answer awarded 10 points per letter in the word (e.g., if the word was \\"scientist\\", correctly solving the word would be worth 90 points). After correctly solving a word the contestant could select another word for the other celebrity on his/her team to guess or attempt to identify the subject of the master puzzle. If he/she elected to attempt to guess the subject, the contestant would ask Clark for a \\"conference\\" with the celebrities and was given seven seconds to discuss an answer. Once the conference was over, the contestant was prompted for an answer. The team who correctly solved the master puzzle earned an additional 100 points, while an incorrect solution passed control to the other team. The trailing team began each subsequent round. Starting in 1976, contestants were awarded a prize for solving the puzzle in addition to the 100 points. From 1976‚Äì79, if a puzzle was solved with only one clue word in one of the first two rounds without knowing the category, the contestant won a new car (failure to solve after one clue word revealed the category). In 1979, this was changed to only awarding a car during the second round each day and with no conference between the celebrities and contestant, although the contestant was still given five seconds to ponder before giving their response without knowing the category. The team who solved the puzzle in the first round also began the second round when the rules changed to only offer a car in the second round; this change was made so that a team did not intentionally lose the first round in order to have a better shot at the car. The game continued for an unmentioned time limit, and the contestant with the most points when time expired won the game. Starting in 1979, a captain whose team scored 1,000 points also won a $1,000 bonus. This version was taped before the era of computerized graphics and featured a manually operated game board that used back-lit tiles that illuminated to show the letters in each word. Hostess Fiala would use a long pointer to indicate the position of each word on the board, as the numbers on the squares were too small to be seen by home viewers. 1986‚Äì87 version The game was played similarly to the 1975 version with modifications to the scoring format. Each word in the first puzzle scored 5 points per letter and solving the puzzle scored 50 points. Scoring in the second round doubled to 10 points per letter and 100 points for solving the puzzle. For the third puzzle, the points increased to 20 points per letter and 200 points for solving the puzzle. Unlike the 1975 version, this version's gameboard was completely computer generated; the coloring of the gameboard would also vary depending on the solution being either a person, place or thing. Crossfire round (both versions) The contestant with the most points at the end of the game played the Crossfire Round along with his/her choice of celebrity partner (a choice of only the winning player's partners in 1975 and a choice of all four in 1986). The team was shown one last crossword puzzle with ten words, none of which were clues to a master puzzle. The team called out words by number and the host read the clue for that word. If the team could solve all ten words in 60 seconds or less, the contestant won the grand prize. In the 1975 version, each correct answer won increasingly valuable prizes, and if the contestant solved all ten they won the grand prize, which was usually a car, but sometimes a trip or a fur coat. In the 1986 version, contestants who solved all ten words won a trip and the opportunity to win a car. Contestants who failed to win the bonus round on the 1986 version won a consolation prize package. Car round (1986‚Äì87 version) The three celebrities who did not play the Crossfire Round were given boxes, each with the name of one of three cars available. After choosing which car to play for, the contestant then chose a celebrity. If the model of the chosen car matched the card in the box held by the chosen celebrity, the contestant won the car. For a time, the fourth celebrity was also a participant in the car round, and a corresponding fourth box was added to the mix; if chosen, it was worth $1,000 to the contestant. For the first two taped episodes, the car round was staged differently: rather than holding boxes containing the names of the three cars offered, the celebrities held the keys to each of the three cars. After choosing a celebrity, that celebrity attempted to unlock the chosen car with his/her key. Episode status The original version is intact and held by Ralph Edwards Productions, but has not been rerun since its original airings. The revival was shown on The Family Channel from June 7The Intelligencer‚ÄîJune 7, 1993 to August 27, 1993,The Intelligencer‚ÄîAugust 27, 1993 and on the now- defunct American Independent Network from 1997 to 1998. On October 26, 2014, cable network GSN aired two episodes of the revived version, both from December 1986 featuring Rosie O'Donnell and Arsenio Hall, respectively.

Toyoda Auditorium, the landmark of Nagoya University, designed by Fumihiko Maki. Nagoya University Higashiyama Campus. The university has produced six Nobel Prize laureates in science. Nagoya University traces its roots back to 1871 when it was a temporary medical school. In 1939 it became Nagoya Imperial University (). In 1947 it was renamed Nagoya University (), and became a Japanese national university. In 2014, according to the reform measures of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, all Japanese national universities became National University Corporation (). The university has a profound tradition of physics and chemistry. Many world-class scientific research achievements include Sakata model, PMNS matrix, Okazaki fragment, Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation, and Blue LED were born in Nagoya University. In the 20th century, NU's Kuno Yasu and Katsunuma Seiz≈ç were nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Yoshio Ohnuki was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics. In the 21st century, NU peoples account for half of the total number of Japanese Nobel Prize winners (up to 2014). Among the six winners of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and the Physics, there are three professors and five alumni. The number of winners is the third among Japanese universities. In addition, the team under Professor Morishima Kunihiro participated in the Scanpyramids project by using special nuclear emulsion plates.

Prior to Foreigner, he was in the band Spooky Tooth.  Life and career  Michael Leslie Jones was born on 27 December 1944 in Portsmouth, England. Jones started playing guitar at an early age, and decided to pursue a career in music. He began his professional music career in the early 1960s as a member of the band Nero and the Gladiators, who scored two minor British hit singles in 1961. After the demise of Nero and the Gladiators, Jones worked as a songwriter and session musician in France for such artists as Fran√ßoise Hardy, Sylvie Vartan, and Johnny Hallyday (\\"The French Elvis\\"), for whom he wrote many songs, including \\"Je suis n√© dans la rue\\" and \\"√Ä tout casser\\" (which features Jimmy Page on guitar). When The Beatles toured France in 1964, they befriended Mick when Hallyday's girlfriend and future wife Sylvie Vartan played on the same bill as they did. Between 1965 and 1971 Jones recorded in France with Tommy Brown (Thomas R. Browne) as State of Mickey & Tommy, as well as under other session names including the Blackburds, Nimrod, and the J&B.; After leaving France to return to his home country, Jones joined Gary Wright, formerly of the band Spooky Tooth, to form Wonderwheel in 1971. In 1972, Jones and Wright reformed Spooky Tooth, and after this Jones was a member of the Leslie West Band. He also played guitar on the albums Wind of Change (1972) for Peter Frampton, and Dark Horse (1974) for George Harrison. In 1976, Jones formed Foreigner with Ian McDonald and recruited lead singer Lou Gramm. Jones co-produced all of the band's albums and co-wrote most of their songs with Gramm. Jones wrote the band's most successful single, \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\".I Want to Know What Love Is Allmusic Retrieved 13 February 2011[ I Want to Know What Love Is ‚Äì Foreigner] Billboard Retrieved 13 February 2011 Tensions developed within the band during the late 1980s, attributed to a difference in musical taste between Gramm, who favoured a more hard-edged rock, as opposed to Jones' interest in synthesisers. Gramm left the band in 1990 but returned in 1992. In 1989, Jones released his only solo album titled Mick Jones on the Atlantic Records label. Jones is the only person to play on every Foreigner album. In between his Foreigner commitments, Jones also started a side career as a producer for such albums as Van Halen's 5150 (1986), Bad Company's Fame and Fortune (1986) and Billy Joel's Storm Front (1989). He co-wrote with Eric Clapton the song \\"Bad Love\\" on Clapton's Journeyman album, and in 2002 co-wrote the song \\"On Her Mind\\" with Duncan Sheik. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he played with Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. He was married to socialite/writer Ann Dexter-Jones, mother of Mark, Samantha and Charlotte Ronson. Ann and Mick have two children, Annabelle and Alexander Dexter-Jones. Married for nearly 25 years, Jones and Dexter-Jones divorced in 2007. In 2017, the couple remarried. He also has two sons, from prior relationships, Roman and Christopher Jones.

Note the transverse crest on the Galea (helmet). It was worn to indicate the wearer's rank in regimental 'triumph' and honorific parades. Its purpose was purely symbolic. It was not part of the standard battle-dress of Roman soldiers in the field. A centurion (; , . ; , or ) was a position in the Roman army during Classical Antiquity, nominally the commander of a century (), a military unit of around 80 legionaries. In a Roman legion, centuries were grouped into cohorts commanded by their senior-most centurion. The prestigious 1st cohort was led by the primus pilus, the most senior centurion in the legion and its third-in- command. A centurion's symbol of office was the vine staff, with which they disciplined even Roman citizens, who were otherwise legally protected from corporal punishment by the Porcian Laws. Centurions also served in the Roman navy. After the 107 BC Marian reforms of Gaius Marius, centurions were professional officers. In Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Byzantine army's centurions were also known by the name kentarch (). The centuries () commanded by the centurion theoretically derive from centum (\\"hundred\\", \\"company\\", or \\"tribe\\"),New College Latin Dictionary but that connection is now disputed.The Roman LegionsThe Complete Roman ArmyThe Roman War Machine Role A cenotaph to Marcus Caelius, a centurion of Legio XVIII killed at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Note the prominent display of the vine staff, his sign of office. In the Roman infantry, the centurions commanded a centuria or \\"century\\". During the Mid Republic these centuries were grouped in pairs to make up a maniple, each century consisting on 30 - 60 men. After the Marian reforms a century typically composed of around 80 men, with six such centuries forming a legionary cohort. Later, generals and emperors further manipulated these numbers with double and half-strength units. Julius Caesar, for instance, made the first cohort of 5 double strength centuries. Centurions received a much higher rate of pay than the average legionary.Earl S. Johnson, Jr., \\"Centurion,\\" The New Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, Vol. 1; Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2006, p. 580. Veteran legionaries often worked as tenants of their former centurions.Rich, John. \\"Military Organization and Social Change.\\" War and Society in the Roman World. Ed. Graham Shipley. Vol. 5. N.p.: n.p., 1993. N. pag. Print. Leicester-Notthingham Studies in Ancient Society During the Imperial era, centurions gradually rose in seniority in their cohort, commanding centuries with higher precedence, until commanding the senior century and therefore the whole cohort. The best centurions were then promoted to the First Cohort, called Primi Ordines, commanding one of the ten centuries and also taking on a staff role. The most senior centurion of the legion was the Primus Pilus who commanded the first century. All centurions, however senior, had their own allocated century. There was little difference between the ranks of centurions except for the Primus Pilus, who also participated in war councils.\\"centurion.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 17 Sep. 2012. . The Primus Pilus was so called because his own century was the first file of the first (rightmost) cohort. Only eight officers in a fully officered legion outranked the Primus Pilus: the legate (legatus legionis), commanding the legion; the senior tribune (tribunus laticlavius), second-in-command of the legion; the Camp Prefect (praefectus castrorum); and the five other tribunes (tribuni angusticlavii) who served as senior staff officers to the legate with a rank roughly equivalent to a modern Colonel. Comparisons between the centurion grades and modern officer ranks can lead to many incorrect assumptions. Centurions could be elected, appointed by the Senate, or promoted from the ranks for a variety of reasons. Julius Caesar is said to have promoted his centurions for displays of valour. Historians cite examples of them being the first over the enemy's wall or through the breach. The various centurion grades may be loosely compared to modern junior and middle officer grades.Goldsworthy, A. (2003) Complete Roman Army pp.68‚Äì73Hoffman, B. (1995) The quarters of the legionary centurions of the Principate. Britannia 26; 107-151 Below the centurions were the optiones, seconds-in-command of centuries. Centurions were held personally responsible for the training and discipline of the legionaries under their command, and they had a reputation for dealing out harsh punishment. Tacitus tells a story in The Annals of a centurion known as \\"Cedo Alteram\\", which roughly translates to \\"Fetch Me Another\\". \\"The mutinous soldiers thrust out the tribunes and the camp-prefect; they plundered the baggage of the fugitives, and then killed a centurion, Lucilius, to whom, with soldier's humour, they had given the nickname 'Cedo Alteram', because when he had broken one vine-stick across a soldier's back, he would call in a loud voice for another‚Ä¶ and another...and another!\\" The vine-stick (vitis) was a symbol of the centurion's authority and the implement with which he meted out punishment. Unlike legionaries, the Roman Centurions carried their swords on their left side as a sign of distinction and carried the pugio (dagger) on the right, as the sidearm. Centurions often had important social status and held powerful positions in society. They seem to have received their status according to their rank.Justin R. Howell, The Imperial Authority and Benefaction of Centurions and Acts 10.34-43: A Response to C. Kavin Rowe., Page numbers of article p25-51, 27p, Journal for the Study of the New Testament, Vol. 31 Issue 1, Sep2008 On retirement, they could be eligible for employment as lictors.The Legions of Rome, Stephen Dando-Collins, pp41, Quercus (December 2010) Seniority Each century had a precedence within the cohort. Centurions' seniority within the cohort and legion depended on the position within the legion of the century they were in charge of, which often took their name from their centurion. Centurions began by leading junior centuries before being promoted to leading a more senior one. Promotion usually came with experience, or at least length of service, but many still never made it as far as leading a 1st cohort. Yet for centurions who showed, say, particularly conspicuous bravery during battle, there was the opportunity to be promoted several grades at once. For example, Julius Caesar's reward for a centurion who had greatly pleased him was to advance him eight grades.The Legions of Rome, Stephen Dando-Collins, pp40, Quercus (December 2010) Promotion through the various grades often meant transferring to another legion. The precedence during the times of the manipular legion, commanding sixty men, was organized like this: *Hastati: Ten junior and ten senior *Principes: Ten junior and ten senior *Triarii: Five junior and five senior For the imperial legion they were organized (in order of who advanced first); *1st cohort *2nd cohort *3rd cohort *4th cohort and so on. There were five centuries in the first cohort, each century with twice the number of soldiers of a normal century. All first- cohort centurions outranked all centurions from other cohorts. The qualities necessary for the centurion Centurions had to be literate (to be able to read written orders), have connections (letters of recommendation), be at least 30 years of age, and have already served a few years in the military. They also have had to be able to boost their soldiers' morale. In the New Testament Matthew's Gospel and Luke's GospelMatthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10 relate an incident in which a servant of a centurion based in Capernaum was ill. In the Gospel of Luke, the centurion concerned had a good relationship with the elders of the local Jewish population and had funded the development of the synagogue in Capernaum, and when he heard that Jesus was in the locality, he asked the Jewish elders to request healing for his servant. In the Gospel of Matthew, the centurion makes direct contact with Jesus. The stories report that Jesus marvelled at his faith and restored his servant to health. The Book of ActsActs 10:1-11:30 tells of a centurion named Cornelius whose righteous and generous acts find favour with God. The apostle Simon Peter is told in a vision to visit Cornelius, a Gentile, with whom association was not permitted under Jewish law. The encounter leads Simon Peter to understand that God accepts non-Jews who believe in God and repent. After this revelation, the message of Jesus was evangelized to the Gentiles.

For the last 24 years of his life he worked in the region then known as the Pimer√≠a Alta, modern-day Sonora in Mexico and southern Arizona in the United States. He explored the region and worked with the indigenous Native American population, including primarily the Tohono O'Odham, Sobaipuri and other Upper Piman groups. He proved that the Baja California Peninsula is not an island by leading an overland expedition there. By the time of his death he had established 24 missions and visitas (country chapels or visiting stations). Early life Kino was born Eusebio Chini (the spelling Kino was the version for use in Spanish-speaking domains) in the village of Segno, (now part of the town of Predaia), then in the sovereign Prince-bishopric of Trent, a part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1665, after his recovery from an illness, as part of a vow fulfillment, he adopted Francesco as second name, for devotion to Saint Francis Xavier. The name is sometimes found in its Latin version (Eusebius Franciscus Chinus) or even in the Germanized form (Eusebius Franz K√ºhn). His parents were Francesco Chini and Margherita Luchi who belonged to the local noble families.Studi trentini 1930, vol. VIII, pg. 7 (See talk page) The exact date of his birth is unknown but he was baptized on 10 August 1645 in the parish church, located in Taio. Kino was educated in Innsbruck, Austria, and after recuperating from a serious illness, he joined the Society of Jesus on 20 November 1665. From 1664-69, he received religious training as a member of the Society at Freiburg, Ingolstadt, and Landsberg, Bavaria. After completing a final stage of training in the Society, during which he taught mathematics in Ingolstadt, he received Holy Orders as a priest on 12 June 1677. Although Kino wanted to go to the Orient, he was sent to New Spain. Due to travel delays while crossing Europe, he missed the ship on which he was to travel and had to wait a year for another ship. While waiting in C√°diz, Spain, he wrote some observations, done during late 1680 and early 1681, about his study of a comet (later known as Kirch's comet), which he published as the Exposici√≥n astron√≥mica de el cometa. This publication was later the subject of a sonnet by the noted colonial nun and poet of New Spain, Sor (Sister) Juana In√©s de la Cruz, O.S.H.Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, Soneto. Aplaude la ciencia Astronomica del Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino, de la Compa√±ia de Jesus, que escrivi√≥ del Cometa.... Inundacion castalida de la unica poetisa, musa decima...; Madrid, 1689 Mission in Baja California Kino's first assignment was to lead the Atondo expedition to the Baja California peninsula of Las Californias Province of New Spain. He established the Misi√≥n San Bruno in 1683. After a prolonged drought there in 1685, Kino and the Jesuit missionaries were forced to abandon the mission and return to the viceregal capital of Mexico City. Missions in the Pimer√≠a Alta Casa Grande in Coolidge, Arizona, begin with the journal entries of Padre Eusebio Francisco Kino when he visited the ruins in 1694. Father Kino began his career in the Pimer√≠a Alta on the morning of 14 March 1687, 24 years and one day before his death on 15 March 1711. This was the morning he left Cucurpe, a town once considered the \\"Rim of Christendom.\\" Once Father Kino arrived in the Pimer√≠a Alta, at the request of the natives, he quickly established the first mission in a river valley in the mountains of Sonora. Subsequently, Kino traveled across northern Mexico, and to present day California and Arizona. He followed ancient trading routes established millennia prior by the natives. These trails were later expanded into roads. His many expeditions on horseback covered over , during which he mapped an area long and wide. Kino's maps were the most accurate maps of the region for more than 150 years after his death. Many of today's geographical features including the Colorado River were first named by Kino. Kino was important in the economic growth of the area, working with the already agricultural indigenous native peoples and introducing them to European seed, fruits, herbs and grains. He also taught them to raise cattle, sheep and goats. Kino's initial mission herd of twenty cattle imported to Pimer√≠a Alta grew during his period to 70,000. Historian Herbert Bolton referred to Kino as Arizona's first rancher. Interaction with the natives In his travels in the Pimer√≠a Alta, Father Kino interacted with 16 different tribes. Some of these had land that bordered on the Pimer√≠a Alta, but there are many cases where tribal representatives crossed into the Piman lands to meet Kino. In other cases, Father Kino traveled into their lands to meet with them. The tribes Kino met with are the Cocopa, Eudeve, Hia C-ed O'odham (called Yumans by Kino), Kamia, Kavelchadon, Kiliwa, Maricopa, Mountain Pima, Opata, Quechan, Gila River Pima, Seri (Comcaac), Tohono O'odham, Sobaipuri, Western Apache, Yavapai, and the Yaqui (Yoeme).

University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, Utah: 2011. This map, which was hand-colored by cartographer Nicholas de Fer, was originally created by Kino in 1696. It is called California or New Carolina: Place of Apostolic Works of Society of Jesus at the Septentrional America. Interests Kino opposed the slavery and compulsory hard labor in the silver mines that the Spaniards forced on the native people. This also caused great controversy among his co-missionaries, many of whom acted according to the laws imposed by Spain on their territory. Kino was also a writer, authoring books on religion, astronomy and cartography. He built missions extending from the present day states of Mexican Sonora, northeast for , into present-day Arizona, where the San Xavier del Bac mission, near Tucson, a popular National Historic Landmark, is still a functioning Franciscan parish church. Kino constructed nineteen rancher√≠as (villages), which supplied cattle to new settlements. Kino practiced other crafts and was reportedly an expert astronomer, mathematician and cartographer, who drew the first accurate maps of Pimer√≠a Alta, the Gulf of California, and Baja California. Father Kino enjoyed making model ships out of wood. His knowledge of maps and ships led him to believe that Mexican Indians could easily access California by sea, a view taken with skepticism by missionaries in Mexico City. When Kino proposed and began making a boat that would be pushed across the Sonoran Desert to the Mexican west coast, a controversy arose, as many of his co-missionaries began to question Kino's faculties. Kino had an unusual amount of wealth for his vocation, which he used primarily to fund his missionary activities. His contemporaries reported on his wealth with suspicion.Lopez, George. Non Nobis: The Servants of Bernard. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK: 1964. Death Crypt housing the remains of Father Kino in Magdalena de Kino. Kino remained among his missions until his death in 1711. He died from fever on 15 March 1711, aged 65, in what is present-day Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, Mexico. His skeletal remains can be viewed in his crypt which is a national monument of Mexico. Legacy Kino has been honored both in Mexico and the United States, with various towns, streets, schools, monuments, and geographic features named after him. The copper silicate mineral Kinoite is named in his honor. In 1965, a statue of Kino was donated to the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall collection, one of two statues representing Arizona. Another statue of him stands above Kino Parkway, a major thoroughfare in Tucson. An equestrian statue featuring Kino stands in Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza across from the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. A time capsule is encapsuled in the base. Another equestrian statue also stands next to the Cathedral in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, M√©xico. The towns of Bah√≠a Kino, and Magdalena de Kino in Sonora and Ejido Padre Kino in Baja California are named in his honor. A park with a statue of Kino resides in the city of Nogales, AZ. The largest statue of Kino is located along the US-Mexico border in Tijuana, Baja California. Also a wine is named after him (Padre Kino), produced by Pernod Ricard Mexico in Hermosillo, Sonora. In 2009, Mexican and American Jesuit provinces and Catholic dioceses, the Jesuit Refugee Service, and the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, founded the Kino Border Initiative, a binational migrant service and advocacy organization in Nogales, Arizona and Nogales, Sonora named in his honor.https://www.kinoborderinitiative.org/who-we-are/ A monument to Kino was erected in 2015 in the garden of Piazza Dante, just outside the historic center of Trento, Italy. In 1963, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Beatification process On July 11, 2020, Pope Francis advanced the cause of Kino's sainthood by recognizing his life of heroic virtue, and declaring him Venerable. Missions and visitas founded After the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, the Catholic Church awarded to the Spanish Crown the lands of \\"New Spain.\\" This grant was with the directive that the Crown would underwrite the efforts to convert the pagan inhabitants to Catholicism. The lands included the Caribbean, Mexico, and portions of what is now the Southwestern United States. In its new lands, the Spanish Crown employed three major agencies to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial presence: the presidio (royal fort), pueblo (town), and the misi√≥n (mission). In addition, there were asistencias (sub-missions or contributing chapels) which were small-scale missions that regularly conducted Divine service on days of obligation, but lacked a resident priest. Visitas (visiting chapels or country chapels) also lacked a resident priest, and were often attended only sporadically. These different types of settlements were established such that each of the installations was no more than a long day's ride by horse or boat (or three days on foot) from one another. Bronze sculpture by Suzanne Silvercruys Each type of frontier station needed to be self-supporting, because supply lines (roads) were non-existent. There was no way to maintain a village from outside sources. To sustain a mission settlement, the Fathers needed either Spanish colonists or converted natives to cultivate crops and tend livestock in the volume needed to support a fair-sized Church establishment. Scarcity of imported materials and lack of skilled laborers compelled the Fathers to employ simple building materials and methods. Although the Spanish hierarchy considered the missions temporary ventures, individual settlement development was not based simply on a priestly whim. The founding of a mission followed long-standing rules and procedures. The paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the Spanish bureaucracy. Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, plenty of wood for fires and building material, and ample fields for grazing herds and raising crops. The Fathers blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs roofed with thatch, reeds, or in Pimer√≠a Alta saguaro ribs or ocotillo branches topped with brush and mud. These simple huts would ultimately give way to the stone and adobe buildings that exist today. The majority of structures, indeed whole villages, were oriented on a roughly east‚Äìwest axis to take the best advantage of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site. Directives from Spain clearly stated that villages were to be sited on the west side of any valley so that the sun would shine in the homes first thing in the morning, discouraging slothful behavior on the part of the inhabitants. When founding a mission compound, first the spot for the church itself was selected, its position marked and then the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. Workshops, kitchens, living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped in a quadrangle, inside which religious celebrations and other festive events could take place. List of missions This listing of the sites founded by Kino is not complete. Also, since names have changed over time, there appears to be some duplication. They are: * Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe located near present-day La Paz, Baja California, was founded in April 1683 and abandoned four months later. Kino wrote in his astronomical treatise on comets that he dedicated his missionary life to Our Lady of Guadalupe. Kino, as the King's cartographer and surveyor, led together with Admiral Atondo the attempt to colonize the Baja California peninsula of the Las Californias Province of New Spain. * Mission San Bruno: founded October 1683 In September 1685, after a prolonged drought there, Kino and the colonists were forced to abandon the mission. * Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores: founded on March 13, 1687. This was the first Pimer√≠a Alta mission founded by Father Kino. By 1744, the mission was abandoned. * Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios was founded in 1687 and was abandoned by 1730. Nothing remains of this mission. * San Ignacio de Cab√≥rica was founded in 1687 and is located in San Ignacio, Sonora. * Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama was founded in 1687, in Tubutama, Sonora. * Santa Teresa de Atil was founded in 1687, in the small town of Atil, Sonora. * Santa Maria Magdalena was founded in 1687, located in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. Kino's grave is located here. * San Jos√© de Imuris was founded in 1687, in Imuris, Sonora. * Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar y Santiago de Coc√≥spera was founded in 1689. It is located in Coc√≥spera, Sonora. * San Antonio Paduano del Oquitoa was founded in 1689. It is located in Oquitoa, Sonora. * San Diego del Pitiquito was founded in 1689. It is located in Pitiquito, Sonora. * San Luis Bacoancos was founded in 1691, but was soon abandoned after Apache attacks. * Mission San Cayetano del Tumac√°cori was founded in 1691 at a native Sobaipuri settlement. This was southern Arizona's first mission and Arizona's first Jesuit mission. Later a chapel was built. (San Cayetano de Calabasas was established in a different location much later, after Kino's time.) Sometime after the 1751 Pima Revolt the settlement and mission were moved to the opposite side of the river and became San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori. * Mission San Jos√© de Tumac√°cori, the presently known location that is a National Historic Park. The farming land around the mission was sold at auction in 1834 and the mission was abandoned by 1840. It is now a National Monument in Tumac√°cori National Historical Park in Southern Arizona. * La Misi√≥n de San Gabriel de Guevavi was founded in 1691. It became a cabecera or head mission in 1701 with the establishment of what Kino described affectionately as a \\"neat little house and church.\\" Through the years its name changed many times so that now it is known by the generic name referencing many saints: Mission Los Santos √Ångeles de Guevavi. The chapel was initially established in a native settlement, but then was destroyed by fire, probably during an indigenous uprising. The church rebuilt in new locations twice, the final and largest one being built in 1751. Its ruins are part of Tumac√°cori National Historical Park. * San L√°zaro was founded in 1691, but was soon abandoned after Apache attacks. * San Xavier del Bac (O'odham [Sobaipuri-O'odham]: Wa:k), 16 mi south of Tucson, Arizona, founded as a missionary location in 1692. The present building, located 1 mi from the original Kino-period location, dates from 1785. The interior is richly decorated with ornaments showing a mixture of New Spain and Native American artistic motifs.

In 1984, he formed Big Audio Dynamite with Don Letts. Jones has played with the group Carbon/Silicon along with Tony James since 2002 and was part of the Gorillaz live band for a world tour in 2010-2011. In late 2011, Jones collaborated with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form the Justice Tonight Band. Early life Michael Geoffrey Jones was born on 26 June 1955 in Wandsworth, London, England, to a Welsh father, Tommy Jones, and a Russian Jewish mother, Renee Zegansky. He spent much of his early life living with his maternal grandmother, Stella Class, in South London. Jones' cousin is Grant Shapps, the Conservative MP for Welwyn Hatfield.Newsnight, BBC2, 14 April 2010 Jones went to Strand School in South London and West London School of Art And Design, because \\"[he] thought that's how you get into bands and stuff\\". He started gaining recognition as a guitarist in the early 1970s with his glam rock band, The Delinquents. A short time later, he met Tony James and formed the protopunk London SS. By 1976, that band had broken up and remaining members Jones, Paul Simonon and Keith Levene were seeking a new direction. Related news articles: * The Clash Mick Jones (centre) on stage with The Clash When he was 21, he and Paul Simonon were introduced to Joe Strummer by Bernie RhodesIn a television interview, Strummer said, after drawing the camera to Bernard sleeping against a wall, \\"He invented punk ... it was obviously too much for him\\", referring ironically to a statement of Rhodes himself. The scene and the statement are featured in the documentary Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten. in a squat in Shepherd's Bush. The band rehearsed in a former railway warehouse in Camden Town and The Clash was formed. Jones played lead guitar, sang, and co-wrote songs from the band's inception until he was fired by Strummer and Simonon in 1983. One of the songs he wrote, \\"Train in Vain,\\" was allegedly about Jones' relationship with Viv Albertine, guitarist of The Slits. Jones' lack of punctuality played a major role in his dismissal from the band. Jones agreed to give a rare interview about the disintegration of The Clash and the reasons behind his dismissal from 'his own band' in Danny Garcia's 2012 documentary film and book The Rise and Fall of the Clash. For his time with The Clash, Jones, along with the rest of the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. While promoting the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says will be the final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death. > There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion > in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper > Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a > performance was going to happen anyway.

It was never at a point where all of us wanted to > do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again > after the group broke up, and continued that way for the rest of the time. > That was more important to us than the band. In an October 2013 interview with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and in fact new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros album. Jones said \\"We wrote a batch ‚Äì we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time ‚Äì like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd come in all night and we'd all work all night.\\" Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album. General Public After his expulsion from the Clash, Jones was a founding member of General Public. Though he is listed in the credits of the band's 1984 debut album All the Rage as a member, Jones left General Public part way through the recording process and was replaced by Kevin White. White's picture appears on the back cover; Jones' picture does not. Jones did play guitar on many of the album's tracks, including the North American top 40 single \\"Tenderness\\". Big Audio Dynamite Leaving General Public behind, in 1984 Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite with film director Don Letts, who had directed various Clash videos and later the Clash documentary Westway to the World. The band's d√©but album This Is Big Audio Dynamite was released the following year, with the song \\"E=MC¬≤\\" getting heavy rotation in dance clubs, and both singles \\"Medicine Show\\" and \\"E=MC2\\" charting in the UK. For Big Audio Dynamite's second album, No. 10, Upping St., Jones reunited with Strummer. Together, the two wrote several songs on the album, including \\"Beyond the Pale\\", \\"V. Thirteen\\", and \\"Sightsee M.C!\\"; Strummer also co- produced the album. Their reunion did not last long, and following that collaboration, the two did not work together again for some time. Big Audio Dynamite's third album, Tighten Up, Vol. 88, featured album cover art painted by the ex-Clash bassist, Paul Simonon. Shortly following its release, Jones developed chickenpox and pneumonia, and spent several months in hospital. After his recovery, Jones released one more album with Big Audio Dynamite, Megatop Phoenix, before reshuffling the line-up, renaming the band Big Audio Dynamite II and releasing The Globe album. The BAD II lineup had an international #1 hit with their song \\"Rush\\", topping the Billboard Modern Rock charts in the U.S. and singles charts in Australia and New Zealand. In 1990, Jones was featured on Aztec Camera's song \\"Good Morning Britain\\", with Roddy Frame. The band's lineup was reshuffled again in 1994, and they released the album Higher Power under the name Big Audio. In 1995, a greatest hits album, Planet B.A.D. was released as well as a studio album called F-Punk under the original Big Audio Dynamite name. A further album, Entering a New Ride was recorded in 1997, but was only released on the internet because of a disagreement with Radioactive Records, their then record label. One more \\"best of\\" collection, called Super Hits, was released in 1999. Jones announced the reuniting of Big Audio Dynamite in January 2011, and they performed at the Lollapalooza music festival in 2011. Recent projects=Carbon/Silicon Jones playing with Carbon/Silicon at the Carbon Casino VI event on 22 February 2008 In 2002, Jones teamed up with his former London SS colleague, Generation X and Sigue Sigue Sputnik member Tony James to form a new band named Carbon/Silicon. The band has toured the United Kingdom and the United States and has performed a number of anti-fascist benefit concerts; they have also recorded three albums: A.T.O.M, Western Front and The Crackup Suite which were available online for free. Their first physical CD release was The News EP. The band encourages their fans to share their music on P2P networks, and allow the audio and video taping of their shows. Their first song, \\"MPFree\\" is an anthem for P2P file sharing. Similar in many respects to Jones' earlier work in Big Audio Dynamite, Carbon/Silicon aims to break the traditional approach to rock and roll. The band was described by Alan McGee as \\"...the Stones jamming with a laptop,\\" and they make use of samples in their recordings and live shows. The formation of the band was catalysed by the internet and p2p file sharing. The first song written by Jones and James was entitled \\"MPFree,\\" in which they expressed their willingness to embrace the technology of the internet and file sharing, in the interest of spreading music, rather than profit. On seven consecutive Friday nights in January and February 2008 Carbon/Silicon played a series of gigs at the Inn on the Green, right under the Westway in Thorpe Close, between Ladbroke Grove and Portobello Road, London. As well as Carbon/Silicon there were many special guests, including appearances by Sex Pistols' Paul Cook and Glen Matlock, former Clash drummer Topper Headon and multi-instrumentalist and former Mescalero, Tymon Dogg. Producer Jones has also been an occasional producer. In 1981 he produced Ellen Foley's second album Spirit of St. Louis. Jones was in a relationship with Foley, and co-wrote songs for the album with Strummer and Tymon Dogg. Players on the album included members of the Blockheads, Tymon Dogg and all four members of the Clash.[ Allmusic.com] In 1981, Jones co-produced Ian Hunter's Short Back 'n' Sides LP with Mick Ronson. He also provided guitars and vocals for several songs on the release. In the same year, he produced Theatre of Hate's first album Westworld released in 1982, written by Kirk Brandon. Jones also played guitar on the title track, \\"Do You Believe in the Westworld\\". Jones would also record and produce Aria of the Devil in 1982 by Theatre of Hate at Wessex Studios, which did not get released until 1998, when the master tapes were found by Kirk Brandon. He produced the London-based band the Libertines' debut album Up The Bracket (2002); Jones stayed on to produce the band's second album The Libertines (2004). He also produced Down in Albion, the debut album of former Libertines lead singer and guitarist Pete Doherty's new group Babyshambles. In 2014 he produced sibling band Kitty, Daisy & Lewis' album The Third. Jones is also credited with contributing guitar and vocals to \\"Mal Bicho\\", the lead track of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs' album Rey Azucar. He provided the score for Nick Mead's film, Dice Life ‚Äì the Random Mind of Luke Rhinehart, a contemporary dance film created by Nick Mead and Wayne McGregor, featuring Luke Rhinehart, author of The Dice Man. At the NME Shockwave 2007 awards, Jones took to the stage and performed \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\\" with Primal Scream. Gorillaz Jones reunited with Simonon on the title track of Gorillaz's 2010 album Plastic Beach: both of them performed in the Gorillaz live band supporting Plastic Beach. The band headlined the 2010 Coachella Festival, Glastonbury and Festival Internacional de Benicassim. Jones later appeared on the 2011 Gorillaz album The Fall on the track \\"Amarillo\\". The Justice Tonight Band In late 2011, Jones agreed to play songs by the Clash live again, collaborating with Pete Wylie and members of the Farm to form The Justice Tonight Band. The band formed with the aim of promoting awareness of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. The Justice Tonight band have been joined onstage at different gigs by several other musicians sympathetic to the cause, including Billy Bragg and Paul Simonon. Shane MacGowan joined them onstage in Phoenix Park when The Justice Tonight Band supported the Stone Roses as part of their Reunion Tour on 5 July 2012. The Wallflowers Jones collaborated with alternative rock group the Wallflowers as a guitarist and backing vocals for two tracks on their 2012 album Glad All Over. Rachid Taha Mick Jones was a featured guest on Rachid Taha's Zoom album (2013) (together with Brian Eno) and Jones toured with Rachid Taha as part of the Zoom project. The Flaming Lips Jones narrated the King's Mouth album by The Flaming Lips, released on 20 April 2019 which is Record Store Day. Jones is also featured on the album's cover artwork. The Flaming Lips's singer Wayne Coyne said of Jones \\"he‚Äôs on almost every song... it really is quite unbelievable.\\" Musical equipment Jones playing his Fender Thinline Telecaster at Carbon Casino VI Jones' first guitar was a Gibson Les Paul Junior with a P-90 pickup, which he bought because Johnny Thunders used one. The Junior was his main guitar up until late 1977 or early 1978, and after that as a backup and studio guitar. Around the same time he also owned another Les Paul Junior, all black (formerly red) with a black pick guard, which was smashed at a performance in 1977. He then switched to a Gibson Les Paul Standard and later to Gibson Les Paul Customs. Jones also occasionally played an Olympic White Fender Stratocaster (for live versions of \\"Straight to Hell\\") and several Bond Electraglide guitars that were donated to him by Andrew Bond, who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger, an analog delay and a noise gate as well as a Roland chorus or Space Echo effect. During his days with the Clash, Jones used a Marshall Plexi amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a Mesa Boogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.

Contributions  He influenced the development of law in Lesotho by contributing to the establishment of a legal structure and to the training of many local lawyers.  England  In England he studied the legal and social position of ethnic minorities, covering civil liberties, family law, criminal and employment law as well as philosophical and political aspects. The focus on ethnic minority law led to many publications, to advice and expertise being sought by the Commission for Racial Equality and the Runnymede Trust. In 1996 he contributed to debates and discussions about extending the Race Relations Act to cover discrimination on grounds of religion. In 1997 he was co-author of a report of a Commission of the Runnymede Trust on discrimination resulting from unfounded hostility to Islam (\\"Islamophobia\\"). About his views, he warned both against islamophobia and against \\"multi-cultural tolerance'\\", seen as a shield for oppression and injustice within the minority communities themselves. He argued that the (British and other European/Western) states had to recognize ethnic diversity in the interests of social peace, albeit within the limits of the fundamental principles of the secular democracy. Poulter also strongly condemned all forms of female genital cutting as female genital mutilation. Starting from the '70's, Muslim organizations in the UK requested that Muslim personal law should be formally recognized as part of the British legal system. Poulter was asked for advice in this by the British authorities. He concluded that this would be impossible for several reasons, among others that it would severely jeopardize the equal rights of women.

The Arms of the Brotherhood of St Mark crest), two crossing winged swords and a swordsman armed with a Zweih√§nder. History The brotherhood originated in the 15th century, but it is not known when exactly it was founded. Hans Talhoffer may have been an early member, or even one of the founders (the lion of St Mark appears in his coat of arms in a manuscript of 1459). The earliest certain attestation dates to 1474. The group held an annual meeting in Frankfurt, where they elected their captain (Hauptmann). In 1487, Frederick III granted them the monopoly on the title \\"master of the long sword\\" (Meister des langen Schwerts), effectively making them a fencers' guild. This title was relevant for the Landsknechts, because a certified \\"master of the long sword\\" wielding the Zweih√§nder was entitled to twice the pay of a normal soldier (Doppels√∂ldner). The earliest reference to the brotherhood calls them the brotherhood of Our dear lady and pure Virgin Mary and the Holy and warlike heavenly prince Saint Mark (). After their recognition by Frederick, the brotherhood was usually referred to as \\"Marxbr√ºder\\", \\"Bruderschaft des heiligen Marren\\" or \\"Bruderschaft des St. Markus\\" (\\"Marx brothers\\", \\"Brotherhood of St. Mark\\"). Anton Rast (captain in 1522) was a known member of the brotherhood. Woodcuts, some of them by Albrecht D√ºrer, and other references, show that more than just rapier use was taught by the Marxbr√ºder. They also taught the use of the Zweih√§nder (as mentioned above), the dussack, the spear, the quarterstaff and the longsword. The dussack, being primarily a practice weapon, was used to train the real-life use of single-edged swords like the gro√ües Messer. A second fencing brotherhood, the Federfechter, was founded in Prague in 1570, and recognized by the city of Frankfurt, in spite of protests by the Marx brothers, in 1575. From 1607 the two societies shared equal privileges, as in that year, the Federfechter received their first letter of privilege from Rudolph II, the Holy Roman Emperor. A third guild may have been Lukasbr√ºder (brotherhood of Saint Luke). They had no official recognition, however, and were probably closer to a society of hooligans than to a proper guild. Important centers of 16th century martial arts in Germany were Frankfurt, Augsburg and Nuremberg.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Nowy Korczyn. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately south of Busko-Zdr√≥j and south of the regional capital Kielce. It is located close to the confluence of the Nida and the Vistula rivers. The village has a population of 1,032, and in the past it was an important administrative center of Lesser Poland. Nowy Korczyn was a town from 1258 to 1869. History Until it lost its city rights, the village was known as Nowe Miasto Korczyn (New Town Korczyn). During its existence, Nowy Korczyn was also known as Khadash, Nayshtut, Neustadt, Novi Kochin, and Novi Kortchin. It was established before 1258 by Boleslaus the Chaste, and used to be an important trade and political center. From the 15th century onwards the General Assembly of Lesser Poland was held there. In the 17th century the town began a decline, and lost its city status in 1869. Up until the Second World War, Nowy Korczyn, by now a village, had a large Jewish community, many of whom perished in the Holocaust. In the Middle Ages, Nowy Korczyn was a trade village, located on a junction of busy merchant roads from Krak√≥w to Kievan Rus', and from Kosice to Sandomierz. To distinguish it from the nearby village of Korczyn (now known as Stary Korczyn, Old Korczyn), Prince Boleslaus V the Chaste named the town Nowe Miasto Korczyn (New Town Korczyn), when he granted it Magdeburg rights (1258). In 1257, when the Prince stayed here with his wife Kinga of Poland, the pious couple decided to found a Franciscan abbey in Nowy Korczyn. The town quickly developed, due to its location, and proximity both to the Vistula waterway and the city of Krak√≥w, where local princes resided during the fragmentation of Poland (see History of Poland during the Piast dynasty). It had a wooden castle, which, together with the town, was burned by the Rus warriors in 1300. New, stone castle was built here in the 1350s by King Kazimierz Wielki, and it quickly emerged as one of the major royal residences in Poland. A defensive wall was built around Nowy Korczyn, furthermore the town was protected by a man-made lake Czartoria. Since Nowy Korczyn is located in the center of Lesser Poland, the town was frequently visited by Polish rulers. It was an important political and judicial center of the province, here Lesser Poland‚Äôs szlachta organized its meetings. In 1404, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço called such a meeting, to discuss new taxes, needed for the planned purchase of the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land from the Teutonic Knights. In 1438, also in Korczyn, the szlachta convened to discuss whether King Jagie≈Ç≈Ço should accept Bohemian crown. On April 25 of the same year, powerful Cardinal Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, who opposed Polish alliance with Czech Hussites, called a Confederation here. In 1439, Polish supporters of the Hussites gathered near Nowy Korczyn, under Spytek of Melsztyn. On 4 May 1439 the royal army under Ole≈õnicki defeated the Hussites in the Battle of Grotniki. In the 15th century, several important meetings and events took place at the Nowy Korczyn castle. In 1461, King Casimir IV Jagiellon hosted here envoys of George of Podƒõbrady, the Crimean Khanate, and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and in 1465, szlachta of both Lesser and Greater Poland gathered here to discuss finances needed to end the Thirteen Years' War. In 1470, Casimir IV Jagiellon met at the Nowy Korczyn castle with papal legate and envoy of Emperor Frederick III. On 9 October 1479 Martin Truchse√ü von Wetzhausen, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, paid homage to the Polish king at Nowy Korczyn. In the Kingdom of Poland, Nowy Korczyn was one of the most important administrative centers of the vast province of Lesser Poland. Here Lesser Poland sejmiks took place, in which regional senators and deputies of the Sejm met to discuss and coordinate their policies. The Nowy Korczyn sejmiks included representatives from Krak√≥w Voivodeship, Sandomierz Voivodeship, Lublin Voivodeship, Podole Voivodeship, and Volhynian Voivodeship. Furthermore, the town was the seat of a starosta (one of six starostas of Sandomierz Voivodeship), and the seat of court for the Wi≈õlica and Pilzno counties. In 1474 most of Nowy Korczyn burned in a fire, after which the town was released from its tax duties for 12 years. In 1549, King Zygmunt August funded a hospital, and at that time, Korczyn was a major beer producer, with 19 small breweries. Furthermore, it had waterworks and baths, built in 1578 with permission of King Stefan Batory. Eight times a year grain markets were organized, and the grain purchased in Nowy Korczyn was transported along the Vistula to Gda≈Ñsk. Korczyn had a number of granaries, in 1566 a new town hall was built, and in 1568 a canal was completed, which connected the man-made lake Czartoria with the Nida river. In 1589, a weapon manufacturer was opened in Nowy Korczyn, producing gunpowder, cannons and rifles. The importance of the town diminished in the early 17th century, after the capital of the Commonwealth was moved from Krak√≥w to Warsaw. In 1606, during the Zebrzydowski Rebellion, Korczyn was ransacked by the rebels, and in 1607, almost whole town with its 266 houses burned in a fire. Further and complete destruction came during the Swedish invasion of Poland, when in 1657 the town was burned to the ground, together with its extensive archives. In 1702, during the Great Northern War, Swedish troops destroyed Korczyn once again, and the town never recovered since then. After the Partitions of Poland, Nowy Korczyn briefly belonged to the Austrian Empire, and since 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Nowy Korczyn burned in 1811, 1855 and 1857, the town was also frequently flooded both by the Vistula and the Nida. In 1860, Nowy Korczyn had the population of 3,319, including 2,370 Jews. In 1869 Russian authorities stripped it of the town charter. In September 1914, Nowy Korczyn was the area where Polish Legions operated. Here the headquarters of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski was briefly stationed, and after the war, the village belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. In the Second Polish Republic it remained a poor village, with a significant Jewish population. In 1944, during Operation Tempest, units of the Home Army attacked German police post in Nowy Korczyn. The synagogue of Nowy Korczyn has been under preservation since 2014.Nowy Korczyn Synagogue before and after. Jewish-heritage-europe.eu. Transport Nowy Korczyn does not have a train station.

In Gau·∏çƒ´ya Vaishnavism, a school of Vai·π£·πáavism, the SƒÅtvata-tantra describes three different forms, or aspects, of Mahavishnu (KƒÅra·πáƒÅr·πáava≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu), Garbhodaka≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu and K·π£ƒ´rodaka≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vishnu. The term Mahavishnu refers to that Absolute truth Brahm(a) or Brahman (impersonal invisible aspect) then as Paramatma (Aspect beyond the understanding of human soul) and finally as Sarvatma(incarnating for bringing perfection). So bhakti (loving devotion) goes to Sarvatman (Krishna or Rama avatars or incarnations of Vishnu, Narayana bringing both peace and perfection of the living beings). In this way, bhakti surpasses even yoga, which is aimed at the Supersoul, Paramatman. Mahavishnu is the Supersoul of all living beings (jivaatmas) in all material universes. KƒÅra≈Üodaksayi Vishnu is understood to be Sankarsana(form) of the Catur-vyuha of NƒÅrƒÅya≈Üa. It is also often used interchangeably with Vishnu to indicate reverence, as the prefix \\"MahƒÅ\\" in vishnu indicates the greatness and the vastness of Narayan. So all the Gods including Purusha form like Shiva, Brahma are considered as the Part of Maha Vishnu Expansion. [Vishwaswaroop] Mahavishnu is said to lie in the Causal Ocean or the Karanodak. He puts the seed of this material universe in MahƒÅmƒÅyƒÅ by glancing at her. MahƒÅmƒÅyƒÅ remains the ever obedient material energy of the Supreme Lord. All the natural elements including sky, fire, water, air and land are created along with mind, intelligence and false ego. After this, Mahavishnu enters each of the many universes so created (seeds emerging from the pores of His skin) as Garbhodaksayi Vishnu, who lays down in each and every of these individual material universes (Brahmandas). It can be interpreted that Garbodakshayi Vishnu is the collective soul of all souls in a particular material universe and that Mahavishnu is the collective soul of all souls in all of the material universes. From Garbhodaksayi Vishnu then emerges BrahmƒÅ who is the secondary creator (due to his need to meditate to create planets in the material universe) of the planetary systems within particularly this material universe (Brahmanda).

The humanoid alien protagonist of the film, Klaatu (Michael Rennie), instructs Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) that if any harm befalls him, she must say the phrase to the robot Gort (Lockard Martin). In response Gort relents from destroying the Earth and resurrects Klaatu from death. The Robot Hall of Fame describes the phrase as \\"one of the most famous commands in science fiction\\" and Frederick S. Clarke of Cinefantastique called it \\"the most famous phrase ever spoken by an extraterrestrial.\\"  Usage in the film  Edmund H. North, who wrote The Day the Earth Stood Still, also created the alien language used in the film, including the phrase \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\". The official spelling of the phrase comes directly from the script, as shown in the above image. The phrase was never translated in the film and neither Edmund North nor 20th Century Fox ever released an official translation. Near the end of the film, as Klaatu is pursued by the American military, he urges Helen Benson to memorize the phrase, saying \\"There's no limit to what he can do. He could destroy the Earth... If anything should happen to me you must go to Gort, you must say these words: Klaatu barada nikto.' Please repeat that.\\" Shortly after, Klaatu is shot and killed. Knowing that Klaatu has died, Gort vaporizes the polymer cube encasing him and kills the two soldiers standing guard. Helen conveys Klaatu's message. Gort takes her inside the spaceship, and then retrieves Klaatu's lifeless body, which he revives. In the 2008 remake, the line was added at Keanu Reeves' insistence. Klaatu uses it near the beginning of the film to shut down Gort, and again at the end, highly distorted and barely audible, when he stops the destruction of the Earth.  Interpretation  Because there is no official translation of the phrase, a few notable attempts have been made to determine the phrase's meaning: Philosophy professor Aeon J. Skoble speculates the phrase is part of a fail-safe feature used during diplomatic missions, whereby Gort's deadly force can be deactivated in the event the robot is undesirably triggered into a defensive posture. Skoble observes that this theme has evolved into a \\"staple of science fiction that the machines charged with protecting us from ourselves will misuse or abuse their power.\\" In this interpretation the phrase apparently tells Gort that Klaatu considers escalation unnecessary. Fantastic Films explored the meaning of \\"Klaatu barada nikto\\" in the 1978 article \\"The Language of Klaatu\\". In the article Tauna Le Marbe, the magazine's Alien Linguistics Editor, attempts to translate all the alien words Klaatu used throughout the film. Le Marbe's literal translation was \\"Stop Barbarism, (I have) death, bind;\\" the free translation was \\"I die, repair me, do not retaliate.\\" The documentary Decoding \\"Klaatu Barada Nikto\\": Science Fiction as Metaphor examined the phrase Klaatu barada nikto with some of the people involved with The Day the Earth Stood Still. Robert Wise, director of the original, recalled a conversation he had with Edmund North, saying North told him, \\"...it's just something I kind of cooked up. I thought it sounded good.\\" Billy Gray, who played Bobby Benson in the film, said that \\"barada nikto must mean... save Earth\\". Florence Blaustein, widow of the producer Julian Blaustein, said North had to pass a street called Baroda every day going to work and said, \\"I think that's how that was born.\\" Film historian Steven Jay Rubin recalled an interview he had with North when he asked the question, \\"What is the direct translation of 'Klaatu barada nikto?' And Edmund North said to me, 'There's hope for Earth, if the scientists can be reached.'\\" In accepting the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998, Director Robert Wise closed his remarks by saying, \\"...I'd like to say 'Klaatu barada nikto', which, roughly translated tonight, means 'Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.'\\"  Popular culture references  *In the 1983 film Return of the Jedi, two of Jabba the Hutt's employees are named 'Klaatu' and 'Barada', the former belonging to one of two 'Nikto' species (the Kadas'sa'Nikto, or 'Green Nikto'). Jedi Master Ima Gun-Di from The Clone Wars is a Kajain'sa'Nikto, or 'Red Nikto,' and the race appears in The Phantom Menace. The Cinema Behind Star Wars: The Day the Earth Stood Still *In the 1985 episode of The Twilight Zone, \\"Chameleon\\" NASA technician Gerald Tyson jokingly quips \\"Klaatu Barada Nikto\\" to his fellow technician Brady Simmons *In the 1992 film Army of Darkness, Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to speak similar words in order to retrieve the Necronomicon but fails to remember it properly (\\"Klaatu... verata... n... Necktie. Nectar. Nickel. Noodle.\\") In the end, he speaks the words again after consuming a potion, allowing him to return to his era. The words were altered from their original use because their meaning was unclear in the original. *Baltimore Sun columnist Dan Rodricks mocked the widely ridiculed 51 ft (15.5-meter) tall Male/Female steel statue at Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station, writing that it \\"...looks like Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still.

Henchmen of the Merovingian, they are \\"Exiles\\", or rogue programs believed to be older versions of Agents from a previous iteration of the Matrix. The Twins have the power of intangibility: they can take on a translucent state in which they pass through physical objects such as floors or gunfire, float through the air, and instantly reset any physical damage to their bodies or clothing. They are also the 'ghosts' the Oracle explains while talking to Neo before the 'Burly Brawl'. In other words, their abilities as programs were still usable in exile. Story The Twins are first seen with the Merovingian smoking a hookah in his restaurant in The Matrix Reloaded. They smirk at the fact that neither Trinity, nor Morpheus, nor Neo appear to have the same intellect as does the Merovingian. The Twins rarely speak, but when they do so, it is with a slow paced English accent, and when one speaks to the other, they usually say \\"we\\", as opposed to \\"I\\". Later, when Morpheus and crew free the Keymaker, the Merovingian sends the Twins to kill the 'Redpills' and recapture the Keymaker. They encounter Morpheus and Trinity in a parking garage and quickly demonstrate both their skill in hand-to-hand combat (using a straight razor) and their ability to become incorporeal, passing through bullets and walls harmlessly and healing injuries that they sustain while in corporeal form. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee in a Cadillac CTS, but they are pursued first by the Twins, then by police and by agents. Eventually, after a long chase along the freeway and firing upon Morpheus and company with an HK UMP, the Twins are dispatched by Morpheus when he causes their Cadillac Escalade EXT to overturn and explode. The explosion sends them into the air and they are last seen turning intangible. They are not seen in The Matrix Revolutions. Following Smith‚Äôs takeover of the Matrix, the Twins might have been assimilated by Smith along with everyone else in the Matrix, and after Neo sacrifices himself to get rid of Smith, and the machines rebooted the Matrix, the Twins most likely returned to their service of The Merovingian. Video game In the Enter the Matrix video game, which chronicles the events leading up to The Matrix Reloaded, the twins are shown attempting to stop Niobe and Ghost from escaping the Merovingian's mansion via a car chase in the multi-leveled garage. In this incarnation of the characters they do not wear their trademark glasses. Their smoking, overturned vehicle can be briefly seen on an overpass at one point during the highway chase level. Online In The Matrix Online, synthesised cheat codes based on those drunk by the Unlimit officer Beirn allowed the Merovingian to retrieve and reforge the fragmented and heavily dissipated RSIs of the Twins. His operatives were tasked with finding the partially reconstructed pieces, which were successfully secured and combined, returning the Twins to fully functional states. Controversy At the time of the release of The Matrix Reloaded, there was some controversy from people who saw the Twins as emblematic of Hollywood's negative portrayal of characters with albinism. Several major media outlets (e.g. USA Today, MSNBC) reported on the story, and it was mentioned in a joke by late-night talk show host Jay Leno: \\"When is the establishment going to give the really white man a break?\\" Film studio Warner Bros. responded to the controversy, with a spokesperson saying, \\"It's not our intention to single out any group of people as villains\\", and \\"It was never our intention to position these characters as albinos\\", noting that the Twins have black eyebrows.

The river which flows into the sea at Margate is called \\"Nkhongweni\\" (place of entreaty) because the original inhabitants were reputed to be so mean that travellers had to beg for hospitality. History In 1908, Henry Richardson, an English surveyor laid out the town and named it Margate after another seaside resort on the northern coast of the county of Kent, in the United Kingdom. Margate hit the world headlines in 1922 (although this date is often disputed and stated as 1924) when an enormous, white, furry creature (dubbed \\"Trunko\\" due to it having an elephantine trunk) was washed up on the beach. The \\"Margate monster\\" was too decomposed to be identified accurately. Geography Margate is situated on the Indian Ocean coastline about 15 km south-west of Port Shepstone and 127 km southwest of Durban. It is situated between Uvongo and Ramsgate in which Uvongo lies north and Ramsgate lies south. Tourism With Margate being a major seaside resort, majority of its economy comes from tourism. Signs of this can be found on the coastline where hotels and holiday accommodation apartments lie. Reputable hotels and holiday accommodation in Margate include the Margate Hotel, Margate Sands, Seagull Holiday Flats and the Desroches Hotel. It features Blue Flag Beaches for swimming, snorkelling, and surfing. Many apartment buildings offer accommodation for residents and visitors. It also contains a shopping street and many restaurants, pubs, and nightclubs, Margate is a spot where many South Africans and foreign visitors spend their vacation. Margate is busiest during school and public holidays when inland residents travel to the coast. Christmas and Easter are especially busy times, with Margate's main street often clogged with heavy traffic during these times. Margate is one of the most visited tourist destinations in South Africa and had the third highest inflow of new visitors in December 2019 in South Africa after Plettenberg Bay and Mossel Bay in the Western Cape Province. This means that Margate had the highest inflow of new visitors in December 2019 in KwaZulu-Natal. Buildings and infrastructure Margate is served by Margate Airport with flights to Johannesburg offered by CemAir. It has one hospital, Netcare Margate Hospital, a police station and four main malls, Margate Mall, Hibiscus Mall, Margate Centre, Margate Rank mall.

It rises from the Bababudanagiri Mountains of Western Ghats and flows through the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The Vedavathi is also called the Hagari in Bellary District of Karnataka and parts of Andhra Pradesh. Two rivers, the Veda and Avathi, arise in the eastern part of the Sahyadri Hill range in Bababudangiri mountain ranges, flow east, and join near Pura to form the Vedavathi River. From there the river flows through Kadur Taluk Of Chikkamagalur District. Then it enters Hosadurga Taluk, Hiriyur Taluk and Challakere Taluk of Chitradurga district, respectively. On the banks of the Vedavathi, there is a famous temple devoted to Shri Anjaneya at Kellodu, Hosadurga Taluk. The Vani Vilasa Saagara reservoir constructed across river Vedavathi in Hiriyur taluk dates back a century. Vanivilas sagar is also known as Marikanive and this was first dam built by Sir M Vishweswariah and known first natural reservoir built between two hills. There is also a famous temple dedicated to Goddessess Devi called \\"Kanive Mariyamma\\". This temple is situated beside Dam Wall. Marikanive is a famous tourist attraction in Chitradurga District. There is a garden near the reservoir, which draws crowds on weekends. A tributary called the Suvarnamukhi confluences with Vedavathi at Koodalahalli, Hiriyur Taluk. It is considered to be a 'Punya Bhumi' or 'Sacred Land' by the locals. The Vedavathi river then flows from Hiriyur towards Narayanapura, Parashurampaura, Vrindavanahalli, where river flows circularly, hence village called Vrindavana Halli and then to Jajur (moodala jajur) Nagagondanahalli, Janamaddi and then enters Andhra Pradesh i.e. Bhairavani Thippa Dam (BT Project). On the banks of Nagagondanahalli there is a famous mathematician named Chilumeswamy who was an avadhoot and there is a popular annual fair. On the other side of Vedvathi river there is a village Jajur. Main temples located in Jajur Kariyamma, Anjaneya, Shiva, Shri Kodanada Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Anjenya, and Nagarakatte and shri Shankaracharya. The river then flows down to the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh in Anantapur District, where the river is called the 'Hagari'. The river has a cultural significance, with the people along the belt of the Hagari depending entirely on the river for most of their needs. Bhairivani Tippa Reservoir is built across this river. From there the river goes through Gundalaplli, Vepurala, Kanekallu and some drylands in Anantapur District. From Andhra Pradesh State, the river enters Bellary district. Then it flows through Bellary and Siruguppa Taluks. In Bellary Taluk, the river flows through Hagari and Moka Villages. Hence its name, Hagari River, as it flows through Hagari Village. The Vedavathi River is a tributary to the Tungabhadra River, and finally joins the Tungabhadra River at Siddaragonde village in Siruguppa Taluk of Bellary District along its right bank. The total length of the Vedavathi River is 391 km from its origin to its confluence with the Tungabhadra River. It is a seasonal river and flows only in the rainy season and is dry for much of the year. The state government has decided to rejuvenate the Vedavathi river in Chikmagalur district, which dries up during summer. In the last 20 years, the river has flowed in full splendour only during the rainy season. It remains dry in summer due to over exploitation of water resources and unplanned development. The plan includes construction of over 810 water-harvesting structures like percolation wells, injection wells and ponds.

Career  Fages was born in Guissona, L√©rida/Lleida province, Catalonia, Spain. In 1762 he entered the light infantry in Catalonia in 1762 and joined Spain's invasion of Portugal during the Seven Years' War. In May 1767 Fages, commissioned as a lieutenant in the newly formed Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia, set sail from C√°diz along with a company of light infantry, voyaging to New Spain (Mexico).

Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 207. Voyage from Baja California to San Diego In 1769, Fages was selected by visitador (Inspector general) Jos√© de G√°lvez to lead the ship-borne portion of the Gaspar de Portol√°-led expedition to found San Diego, California. Lieutenant Fages sailed from Guaymas to the Baja California port of La Paz. Then on January 9, 1769, he boarded the galleon San Carlos, captained by Vicente Vila and bound for San Diego. Also on board were Franciscan friar Fernando Parr√≥n, engineer and cartographer Miguel Costans√≥, surgeon Pedro Prat, and 25 soldiers under Fages' command along with a crew of sailors. After sailing nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) beyond San Diego due to cartography errors, the San Carlos doubled back south. It finally arrived in San Diego Bay on April 29, with scurvy-ridden troops and crewmen. Interaction with Kumeyaay Indians Upon recovering from the ill effects of the voyage, Fages set about carrying out the instructions of Jos√© de G√°lvez: Along with Miguel Costans√≥, he reconnoitered the port and inland areas of San Diego, exploring especially today's Mission Valley. In his letter reporting to G√°lvez, Fages observed of the local Kumeyaay Indians: \\"‚Ä¶They appear to be docile and alert. We have made very good friends with them and we are never lacking some little rabbits, hares, and fish that they bring to us. We give them some glass beads. But they value very highly any kind of cloth ‚Äî no matter how poor it might be ‚Äî since in exchange for some that I had, I received some furs and nets.\\"\\"Pedro Fages and Miguel Costans√≥: Two Early Letters From San Diego in 1769\\". Journal of San Diego History, vol. 21, no. 2, spring 1975. Translated and edited by Iris Wilson Engstrand. Costans√≥, while branding the Kumeyaay as \\"lazy idlers,\\" noted that \\"they have bestowed great affection upon Don Pedro Fages and they also respect him very much. They have invited him at various times to be with their women, an expression of friendship that the rest have not merited. \\"\\"Pedro Fages and Miguel Costans√≥: Two Early Letters From San Diego in 1769\\". Journal of San Diego History, vol. 21, no. 2, spring 1975. Costans√≥ recounts a demonstration Fages arranged to prove the superiority of Spanish firearms: Armed with bows and arrows tipped with \\"very sharp flints,\\" the Kumeyaay men initially viewed the Spaniards' guns as \\"simple sticks.\\" Fages ordered a leather target erected at a practical distance. The Indians fired their arrows, which had only a \\"mild effect\\" on the leather. Fages then ordered his best marksmen to shoot at the same target. \\"Upon hearing the noise and seeing the destruction so close at hand, the Indians changed their expressions and some of the more timid ones left, giving very clear signs of their surprise and fear.\\"Letter from Miguel Costans√≥ to Jos√© de G√°lvez, San Diego, June 28, 1769.

Caption reads: \\"Pedro Fages and Fray Juan Crespi first white men to set foot on land now Berkeley...\\" On July 14, 1769, Fages set out from San Diego with a party of 74 men on the Portol√° expedition to locate Monterey Bay. The party included Catalan volunteers, leather-jacketed soldiers, Christian Indians from Baja California, and friars Juan Cresp√≠ and Francisco G√≥mez along with other military officers. During this time he was promoted to captain. Although the party failed to recognize Monterey Bay as they passed it, they explored all the way up the coast to San Francisco. The 74 men returned exhausted to San Diego on January 24, 1770, having had to slaughter and eat their mules on the return trek south.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 232, 237. Second Portol√° expedition to Monterey In the spring of 1770, Fages joined the second overland Portol√° expedition from San Diego to Monterey, along with friar Juan Cresp√≠, twelve Catalan volunteers, seven leather-jacketed soldiers, two muleteers, and five Baja Christian Indians ‚Äî aiming to establish a Catholic mission in Monterey.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 246. After Portol√° left California in 1770, captain Pedro Fages was left in charge of the Presidio of Monterey, as the somewhat independent lieutenant-governor of California Nueva (New California) ‚Äî which, in 1770, became part of Las Californias, and was later split from Baja California to become Alta California. In March 1770 Felipe de Barri, in Baja California, was made governor of both Baja and Alta California (1770‚Äì75). But, since Monterey was far away, Fages had free rein to run Alta as acting governor. Strict discipline to build Monterey presidio Taking charge of constructing the Spanish presidio (fort) in Monterey, Fages imposed strict discipline on his soldier laborers. He decided the amount of work they had to do in a certain time, harshly punishing soldiers caught resting or rolling a cigarette. Heavy rains punctuated the spring and winter of 1770-1, but Fages permitted no let- up in the work. His soldiers had to trudge through mud to the forest to chop wood, then drag their mules out of the mud and head home. They had no chance to wash or mend their clothes during the six-day work week; Fages told them to do that on Sundays. On Sundays, they had to carry a week's supply of wood for Fages' kitchen and fetch their own water from the Carmel River some six miles away; clean their weapons; and pass inspection. This work regime lasted a year and a half. Fages' soldiers viewed him as a tyrant, until complaints by the soldiers persuaded padre president Jun√≠pero Serra to intervene. Serra told Fages that, as a Christian, he had to observe the sabbath and let his men rest on Sundays.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 253. The soldiers raped the Indian women and took them as concubines. At Serra's urging, Fages punished some of the more excessive incidents of sexual abuse, but it did not stop. The two men did not get along and Serra soon made plans to move the mission across the peninsula to Carmel.Paddison, p. 23: Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. Weekly rations for the soldiers consisted of two gallons of corn, a pound of beans, a pound of pinole, half a pound of panocha, and four pounds of meat. The meat, delivered in barrels from the galleon San Antonio, often proved too putrid to eat. Weevils infested some of the corn and meal. The soldiers supplemented their diet by gathering wild herbs and hunting geese on Sundays. They also traded what goods they had like ponchos, knives, daggers and handkerchiefs for food from the Indians. News of the soldiers' harsh treatment and poor conditions gradually reached Mexico, and Alta California became an undesirable assignment. In late June 1771, Fages wrote to viceroy Carlos de Croix in Mexico to inform him that the Monterey presidio had been built, sending along a simplified map. Fages had also started a large vegetable garden with an irrigation supply, and three plots dedicated to growing wheat, barley, rice and beans. He described the Indians of the Monterey/Carmel area as having well-proportioned bodies but feeble spirits.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, pp. 253-4, 259. He also described their dress: Expeditions to San Francisco Bay In November 1770, Fages led an expedition from Monterey by land to San Francisco Bay. Rather than follow Portol√°'s difficult trail around Monterey Bay to Santa Cruz and along the coast, Fages found an easier route through present-day Salinas and the Santa Clara Valley (today's U.S. Route 101). Fages' new trail became the preferred route, and missions were later established along that road at Mission San Juan Bautista, Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Jose. From the southern end of the bay, Fages pushed on another day to the farthest camp used by Portol√°'s scouts of the previous year, at San Lorenzo Creek in modern Hayward, on the eastern shore of the bay. From there, scouts ranged a few miles farther north, to a point where the view opened up, and they became the first Europeans to see the entrance to the great bay (although from the opposite side of the bay), a vantage on the slopes above the bay in modern Oakland. Fages set out again in 1772, following his own newly established inland trail north to San Francisco Bay, and accompanied again by friar Juan Cresp√≠, who kept a daily journal,. Continuing along the eastern shore and pushing on past his previous stopping point, Fages saw for himself the entrance to San Francisco Bay, now known as the Golden Gate. The party continued north along San Pablo Bay but was prevented from going farther north by the Carquinez Strait. Following the bay around to the east, Fages' group climbed the slopes of Mount Diablo and became the first Europeans to see the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the Central Valley of California and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Seeing that it was impossible to cross the wide river without boats, the party looped around to return to San Jose through today's Contra Costa County (roughly following today's I-680 highway).Merriman-Brown, p.20-21 Messengers from Monterey met the party during its return, informing Fages and Cresp√≠ of an emergency. The other Spanish colony, at San Diego, was suffering from severe food shortages. Cresp√≠ immediately set out with a pack train to deliver food, but this left Monterey also suffering. The Spaniards had not so far had much luck as hunters in California but, in desperation, Fages ordered that the soldiers set out in small parties to hunt the huge and fearsome California grizzly bear.Merriman- Brown,p.21-23 Fages himself joined the hunt, and earned his nickname l'√≥s while hunting bears near San Luis Obispo. Fages' first tenure as commander in Monterey ended in 1774, after he quarreled with Father Jun√≠pero Serra, president of the Alta California missions. He was replaced as lieutenant- governor by another veteran of the Portol√° expedition, Fernando Rivera y Moncada. In 1777, Fages was posted to Sonora to fight the Apaches, where he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1781 he successfully quelled the Quechan (Yuma) Indian revolt and temporarily reopened the Colorado River crossing of the Anza trail at Yuma, Arizona. The Quechan successfully re- closed the trail for the next 50+ years after Fages and his troops departed, ensuring that the two journeys led by Juan Bautista de Anza were the first, last, and only Spanish expeditions ever to use the trail. Pedro Fages returned to Monterey in 1777, appointed Governor of the Californias, replacing Felipe de Neve. Monterey replaced Loreto as the capital of the Californias in that year, the Loreto military governorship being replaced by a presidio commander and a civil administrator. In 1804, Las Californias was officially split into Alta California and Baja California. During Fages' second tenure as governor, two missions were founded: Mission Santa Barbara (December 4, 1786) and La Purisima Mission (December 8, 1787). Reporting on the Carmel mission in 1787, Fages described the area's Indians as the laziest, most brutish and least rational of all the natives discovered between San Diego and San Francisco. He reckoned those qualities ‚Äî along with the foggy and windy climate, shortage of potable water, high death rate, and language barriers ‚Äî accounted for the painfully slow progress of mission Carmel.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 1, p. 259. Concerned over the shortage of skilled artisans in his domain, governor Fages proposed in 1787 that artisans imprisoned in Mexico City and Guadalajara have their sentences commuted to exile in California ‚Äî provided they serve out their terms at presidios or missions and then stay on as settlers. New Spain's rulers did not act on Fages' proposal.(reprinted 2015) Fages was promoted to colonel in 1789, and resigned his governorship in 1791, at the request of Father Serra. Pedro Fages moved back to Mexico City, where he died in 1794. Tumultuous marriage Fages married Eulalia Francesca Josepha Callis on June 3, 1780 in Mexico City. Born October 4, 1758 in Barcelona, Spain, Eulalia was a full generation younger than Pedro Fages. She journeyed to Mexico City with her mother and brother to join her father Agust√≠n Callis, captain of the Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia formed to suppress rebellions by Pima and Seri Indians of Sonora. In 1781, Eulalia and Pedro traveled to Arizpe, Sonora, where Eulalia gave birth to her first child, Pedrito. When Fages got reassigned to Alta California as governor in 1782, Eulalia and Pedrito remained in Sonora. Then they traveled to Baja California under military escort. Fages journeyed south to Loreto to pick them up. Departing Loreto in July, they arrived in Monterey in January 1783. In the spring of 1784 Pedro and Eulalia, now pregnant, traveled north ‚Äî Eulalia being carried in a litter ‚Äî to San Francisco. There they met up with padre president Jun√≠pero Serra.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 2, p. 332. Eulalia found the weather in San Francisco unpleasant and wanted to move to Santa Clara. Fages repeatedly asked the friars running mission Santa Clara to grant Eulalia hospitality there. The friars, feeling it improper for them to host the pregnant se√±ora gobernadora, feigned ignorance of governor Fages' insistent requests. They referred the matter to padre Serra, who seconded their circumspect posture. So Eulalia's second child, Mar√≠a del Carmen, was born in San Francisco in August 1783.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 2, pp. 332-3. 'But let a woman in your life‚Ä¶' After Eulalia returned to Monterey from San Francisco, she kept pressing her husband to give up his career in California and return to Mexico. Fages wanted to stay on as governor. After a series of quarrels, Eulalia broke off relations with Pedro. When Pedro seemed unfazed by the separation, Eulalia accused him of consorting with an Indian maidservant of their household. Threatening divorce, Eulalia left the house. In February 1785, Fages sought the advice of the friars at Mission Carmel. Friar Mat√≠as de Santa Catalina Noriega concluded that Eulalia still had the obligation to live with her husband and tried to persuade her to reunite with Pedro. Eulalia refused, and appealed her case to the bishop. When Fages returned from a trip to Baja California ‚Äî during which time Eulalia lived at mission Carmel ‚Äî she finally agreed to move back into her husband's house. In August 1785, aging friar Francisco Pal√≥u arrived at Monterey from mission Santa Clara, planning to return to Mexico and retire. Fages confided to Pal√≥u that Eulalia still felt unhappy in his house and still wanted to return to Mexico. He asked Pal√≥u to escort Eulalia as far as Guadalajara. Pal√≥u objected that it would be improper for him, a missionary, to escort any woman, even the governor's wife. Instead, Pal√≥u spent a whole day trying to dissuade Eulalia from going to Mexico, pointing out all the hardships the trip would entail. Eulalia finally relented and agreed to stay in Monterey. Apparently dissatisfied with that resolution, Fages threw bureaucratic obstacles in the way of Pal√≥u boarding the ship that would carry him to Mexico ‚Äî delaying Pal√≥u's departure until November.Maynard Geiger. The Life and Times of Fray Jun√≠pero Serra. Academy of American Franciscan History, 1959, vol. 2, pp. 394-6. Reconciliation In January 1787, Fages wrote a letter to padre Pal√≥u, in which he reported: \\"[About] six months ago Eulalia suddenly called me one morning with a thousand protests, tears, and humility and asked my pardon for all the past. She voluntarily confessed that everything had been a pretense and falsehood and that she herself had bribed the Indian girl to take part in the plot‚Ä¶ Thank God we are now living in union and harmony.\\"Francisco Pal√≥u, Historical Memoirs of New California, edited by Herbert E. Bolton. Literary Licensing, 2011, vol. 4, p. 379.  Fictional portrayals  The novel Mistress of Monterey: A Story of Lost Romance in Eighteenth Century California by Virginia Stivers Bartlett (1933, reprinted by Event Horizon Press) draws a psychological portrait of Eulalia Callis in her mercurial relationship with her husband Pedro Fages. Bartlett also sets the tensions between Eulalia and Pedro within the complex interplay between Spanish military officers and Franciscan missionaries in Alta California. Pedro Fages appears as a minor character in the 1955 film Seven Cities of Gold, which presents a fanciful and historically inaccurate account of the founding of Spanish California. Lieutenant Fages is played by Mexican actor Victor Junco. In the credits, Fages' name is misspelled as \\"Faces.\\" Governor Fages and his wife make a brief appearance in the Isabel Allende novel Zorro. Pere Fages is the protagonist of the historical novel La √∫ltima conquista (2005) by Ram√≥n Vilar√≥ and is a secondary character in Los acasos (2010) by Javier Pascual.

Emergency lights are standard in new commercial and high occupancy residential buildings, such as college dormitories, apartments, and hotels. Most building codes require that they be installed in older buildings as well. Incandescent light bulbs were originally used in emergency lights, before fluorescent lights and later light-emitting diodes (LEDs) superseded them in the 21st century. History By the nature of the device, an emergency light is designed to come on when the power goes out. Every model, therefore, requires some sort of a battery or generator system that could provide electricity to the lights during a blackout. The earliest models were incandescent light bulbs which could dimly light an area during a blackout and perhaps provide enough light to solve the power problem or evacuate the building. It was quickly realized, however, that a more focused, brighter, and longer-lasting light was needed. The modern emergency floodlight provides a high-lumen, wide-coverage light that can illuminate an area quite well. Some lights are halogen, and provide a light source and intensity similar to that of an automobile headlight. Early battery backup systems were huge, dwarfing the size of the lights for which they provided power. The systems normally used lead acid batteries to store a full 120-volt charge. For comparison, an automobile uses a single lead acid battery as part of the ignition system. Simple transistor or relay technology was used to switch on the lights and battery supply in the event of a power failure. The size of these units, as well as the weight and cost, made them relatively rare installations. As technology developed further, the voltage requirements for lights dropped, and subsequently the size of the batteries was reduced as well. Modern lights are only as large as the bulbs themselves - the battery fits quite well in the base of the fixture. Modern installations A small emergency light. Modern emergency lighting is installed in virtually every commercial and high occupancy residential building. The lights consist of one or more incandescent bulbs or one or more clusters of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED). The emergency lighting heads are usually either PAR 36 sealed beams or wedge base lamps. All units have some sort of a device to focus and intensify the light they produce. This can either be in the form of a plastic cover over the fixture, or a reflector placed behind the light source. Most individual light sources can be rotated and aimed for where light is needed most in an emergency, such as toward fire exits. Modern fixtures usually have a test button of some sort which temporarily overrides the unit and causes it to switch on the lights and operate from battery power even if the main power is still on. Modern systems are operated with relatively low voltage, usually from 6-12 volts. This both reduces the size of the batteries required and reduces the load on the circuit to which the emergency light is wired. Modern fixtures include a small transformer in the base of the fixture which steps- down the voltage from main current to the low voltage required by the lights. Batteries are commonly made of lead-calcium, and can last for 10 years or more on continuous charge. U.S. fire safety codes require a minimum of 90 minutes on battery power during a power outage along the path of egress. Compliance Codes New York City requires emergency lights to carry a Calendar Number signifying approval for local installation, Chicago requires emergency lighting to have a metal face plate, and Los Angeles requires additional exit signs be installed within of the floor around doors to mark exits during a fire, as smoke rises and tends to block out higher installed units. As there are strict requirements to provide an average of one foot candle of light along the path of egress, emergency lighting should be selected carefully to ensure codes are met. In recent years, emergency lighting has made less use of the traditional two-head unit - with manufacturers stretching the concept of emergency lighting to accommodate and integrate emergency lighting into the architecture. An emergency lighting installation may be either a central standby source such as a bank of lead acid batteries and control gear/chargers supplying slave fittings throughout the building, or may be constructed using self-contained emergency fittings which incorporate the lamp, battery, charger and control equipment. Self-contained emergency lighting fittings may operate in \\"Maintained\\" mode (illuminated all the time or controlled by a switch) or \\"Non-Maintained\\" mode (illuminated only when the normal supply fails). Some emergency lighting manufacturers offer dimming solutions for common area emergency lighting to allow energy savings for building owners when unoccupied using embedded sensors. Another popular method for lighting designers, architects and contractors are battery backup ballasts that install within or adjacent to existing lighting fixtures. Upon sensing power loss, the ballasts switch into emergency mode turning the existing lighting into emergency lighting in order to meet both the NFPA's Life Safety Code and the national Electric Code without the need of wiring separate circuits or external wall mounts. Codes of practice for remote mounted emergency lighting generally mandate that wiring from the central power source to emergency luminaires be kept segregated from other wiring, and constructed in fire resistant cabling and wiring systems. Codes of practice lay down minimum illumination levels in escape routes and open areas. Codes of practice also lay down requirements governing siting of emergency lighting fittings, for example the UK code of practice, BS5266, specifies that a fitting must be within horizontal distance of a fire alarm call point or location for fire fighting appliances. The most recent codes of practice require the designer to allow for both failure of the supply to the building and the failure of an individual lighting circuit. BS5266 requires that when Non Maintained fittings are used, they must be supplied from the same final circuit as the main lighting circuit in the area. Relevant standards IEC 60598-2-22 Ed. 3.0: Luminaires - Part 2-22: Particular requirements - Luminaires for emergency lighting IEC 60364-5-56 Ed. 2.0: Low-voltage electrical installations - Part 5-56: Selection and erection of electrical equipment - Safety services ISO 30061:2007 (CIE S 020/E:2007): Emergency lighting (specifies the luminous requirements for emergency lighting systems)  Types  For UK and Australian regulations, two types are distinguished: * Maintained luminaires are permanently illuminated, and remain illuminated when power fails. They are used for tasks such as emergency exit lighting. In some cases they may be switched off deliberately, but are usually required to be active when a building is occupied, or when the public are admitted, such as for a theatre. * Sustained or non-maintained luminaires may be switched on and off normally. If the power fails, they turn on automatically.

It has its source near Henstedt-Ulzburg, Schleswig-Holstein, flows somewhat southwards through much of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and joins the Elbe in central Hamburg. The Alster is Hamburg's second most important river. While the Elbe river is a tidal navigation of international significance and prone to flooding, the Alster is a non-tidal, slow-flowing and in some places, seemingly untouched idyll of nature, in other places tamed and landscaped urban space. In the city center, the river forms two lakes, both prominent features in Hamburg's cityscape.  Geography  Iron plate at the Alster's source in Henstedt-Ulzburg In total, the Alster is long and has an incline from 31 m to 4 m above sea level. Its drainage basin is about .Hans Wilhelm Eckhardt. Alster in Hamburg Lexikon, p. 24 Left tributaries to the Alster are: R√∂nne, Alte Alster, Sielbek, Ammersbek, Drosselbek, Bredenbek, Rodenbek, Lohbek, Saselbek, Osterbek, and Wandse (Eilbek); right tributaries to the Alster are: M√ºhlenau (or M√ºhlenbach), Diekbek, Mellingbek, Susebek, Tarpenbek, and Isebek.  Upper course  The source of the Alster is a small bog pool in the Timhagen Brook near Henstedt-Ulzburg, approximately north of Hamburg. The small brook makes a couple of curves before entering Hamburg territory at Duvenstedt and Wohldorf-Ohlstedt. At that point, the Alster has passed a couple of smaller locks and has been passed by 15 bridges. From here on, Hamburgers use the river for water sports, especially for canoe and kayak trips on the river, or hikes along its shores. At Wellingsb√ºttel, the Alster runs past Wellingsb√ºttel Manor. At Ohlsdorf the Alster reaches a weir, approximately at the height of the former Fuhlsb√ºttel Lock, the last water level regulation before reaching the inner city. From Fuhlsb√ºttel downstream, the Alster's course, has been straightened on several locations, with old and new river beds occasionally forming parallel canal beds. Between city limits and the inner city's first lake ‚àí the Au√üenalster ‚àí the river is crossed by 42 bridges.  Lower course  For Hamburg's inner city, the river is a major geographical feature and greatly defines its cityscape. Through ponding of the river in the 13th century, two artificial lakes, the Au√üenalster (Outer Alster) and the smaller Binnenalster (Inner Alster) were created in central Hamburg. These two lakes and the surrounding parks serve as important recreational areas in the heart of the city. Binnenalster and the subsequent Kleine Alster form important urban spaces. The Alster's final section between Kleine Alster and its mouth at Binnenhafen, is called Alsterfleet, as part of a network of inner-city canals, including Bleichenfleet, Herrengrabenfleet, M√∂nkedammfleet, Neuerwallfleet and Nikolaifleet. Alsterfleet is regulated by two locks at Rathaus/Rathausmarkt and Baumwall, the latter protecting it from the Elbe tide. Panoramic view of Kleine Alster looking \\"upstream\\"; Alsterarkaden (left), Reesendammbr√ºcke (center) and Rathausmarkt (far right)  History  Hamburg was founded at the mouth of the Alster river in the 9th century and used it as a port. The water was used to flood the moats of the fortifications. The Alster has been dammed since 1190, originally to power a watermill. In 1235 a further dam was built for a second mill, which changed the shape of the river to be like a lake. In the 15th and 16th century, an Alster canal was built to connect Hamburg with L√ºbeck. The canal was about long and built from the Alster to the Beste, a tributary of the Trave river, at S√ºlfeld. Because of the difficulties in holding water, especially near marsh areas, the long waterway from Hamburg to L√ºbeck was navigable from 1529 to 1550 only.Hans Wilhelm Eckhardt. Alster- Kanal in Hamburg Lexikon, p. 26 Hamburg expanded along the shores of the Alster, and several locks were constructed to make the river navigable. Until the 19th century water transport with barges were used up to the town of Kayhude. The barges--transporting building material, fuel, and foods--were staked or hauled.  Economy  Paddleboats on the Alster near Rathsm√ºhlendamm The Alster is navigatable some 9 km upstream from the mouth. Alster Touristik GmbH (ATG), a subsidiary of the Hamburger Hochbahn, provides public and touristic transport on a fleet of Alster ferries in the city of Hamburg.Alster Touristik alstertouristik.de Along the entire course within Hamburg, rowing or paddle boats are available for rent.  Ecology  Hamburg's white Alster swans (Alsterschw√§ne) at Kleine Alster In general, the Alster is assessed to be clean. Hamburg's Alster and its lakes and canals are famous for its white swans, cared for out of public funds since the 16th century.  Legacy  The Alster basin was an important model for the design of the Charles River basin, constructed in the early 20th century. Throughout much of Germany, an Alsterwasser (literally: \\"Alster's water\\") is the name for a type of shandy, a concoction of equal parts of beer and lemonade. The river inspired the Hamburg-born composer Oscar Fetr√°s to compose the popular waltz \\"Mondnacht auf der Alster\\"Oscar Fetr√°s - Mondnacht auf der Alster, youtube.com (in English: \\"Moonlit Night on the Alster\\"). Hamburg's largest aquatic center, the Alster- Schwimmhalle, is named after the river.

Conflict with Anish Kapoor Semple came into conflict with the artist Anish Kapoor when Kapoor purchased exclusive artistic rights to the 'world's blackest' material, Vantablack, in 2016. Vantablack is made of microscopic stems of carbon that are 300 times as tall as they are wide, so that 99.6% of all light gets trapped in the network of stems. The material was being developed for scientific and military use because of its masking ability. It has the potential to hide stealth aircraft and block out all light from entering powerful telescopes, enabling them to see the faintest stars. After purchasing the rights to Vantablack in 2016, Kapoor faced a backlash from the artist community. Artist Christian Furr commented that he had \\"never heard of an artist monopolising a material. All the best artists have had a thing for pure black ‚Äì Turner, Manet, Goya ‚Ä¶ This black is like dynamite in the art world. We should be able to use it. It isn't right that it belongs to one man.\\" Semple positioned himself at the forefront of this backlash when he released PINK ‚Äì the world's pinkest pink paint ‚Äì in retaliation. Semple explicitly banned Kapoor from buying the paint, stating that \\"We all remember kids at school who wouldn't share their colouring pencils, but then they ended up on their own with no friends. It's cool, Anish can have his black. But the rest of us will be playing with the rainbow!\\" Purchasers of PINK are required to make a legal declaration during the online checkout process, confirming that: \\"you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into that hands of Anish Kapoor.\\" Kapoor managed to acquire the pigment and on his Instagram account posted a picture showing his middle finger dipped in PINK, with the caption \\"Up yours #pink.\\" Semple responded by describing Kapoor as \\"some kind of end-of-game super baddie\\" who \\"should be old enough to know better\\" after Kapoor's Instagram post. Roisin O'Connor writing for The Independent called it \\"one of the most spectacular displays of pettiness\\" ... \\"these are two grown men fighting over who gets to use the pretty colours.\\" On 3 February 2017 Semple hit back at Kapoor with the release of his own version of Vantablack, dubbed \\"Better Black\\".

Standards The NEM standards are defined and maintained by the Technical Commission of the MOROP in collaboration with model railroad manufacturers. The NEM standards define the model railroad scales and guide manufacturers in creating compatible products and assist modellers in constructing model railroad layouts that operate reliably. The standards cover areas like suggested grades, turnout radii, wheel profiles, coupling designs and Digital Command Control (DCC) and are mostly scale specific. A fundamental principle in NEM standards are compromises in the exact scale reduction ratio in order to favour operational reliability of model railroad systems. An example for this is wheel flanges which tend to be proportionally wider in smaller scales to ensure reliable operation. The NEM standards cover areas similar to the standards and recommended practices defined by the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) in the United States, but the two standards are not universally interchangeable. In recent years, MOROP and NMRA have been working more closely together to establish common standards for developments such as DCC.

History The village belonged to the Sz√©kely seat of Cs√≠ksz√©k, then from 1876 until 1918 to the Cs√≠k County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, it became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô- Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.

Its fortified walls were built in the late 18th, early 19th centuries. The design of the defense corridors is unique in the Sz√©kely Land. The church tower was heightened in 1720 and covered with tin sheets in 1850.

Other members were Augustus Egg, Alfred Elmore, William Powell Frith, Henry Nelson O'Neil, John Phillip and Edward Matthew Ward. They have been described as ‚Äúthe first group of British artists to combine for greater strength and to announce that the great backward-looking tradition of the Academy was not relevant to the requirements of contemporary art‚Äù.Greysmith, David, ‚Äò‚ÄôRichard Dadd: The Rock and Castle of Seclusion‚Äô‚Äô, London, Studio Vistas, 1973, p.76 Foundation Information about the activities of The Clique derives mainly from the reminiscences of Frith and a short essay published in The Art Journal in 1898 by Gilbert Imray, a friend of the group. Both state that the group called themselves by this name at the time and that they formed a sketching club. Imray describes the aspirations of some members and explains that at their meetings they would all produce drawings on the same subject and ask non-artists such as Imray to judge the merits of the works.Imray, J., A Reminiscence of Sixty Years Ago, Art Journal, 1898, p.202. They met together at the end of the 1830s and early 1840s. The group broke up in 1843 when Dadd became insane and was incarcerated after murdering his father. The others all became successful members of the Royal Academy of Arts (though O'Neil only became an associate member, not a full member). Their work was supported by the newly founded periodical The Art Journal. Ideas The Clique was characterised by their rejection of academic high art in favour of genre painting, following the precedents of William Hogarth and David Wilkie. This was in line with their view that art should be judged by the public, not by its conformity to academic ideals. In the 1850s most members of The Clique became inveterate enemies of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, believing their art to be willfully eccentric and primitivist. Frith and O'Neil wrote many attacks on Pre-Raphaelite principles. However Egg became a friend and supporter of William Holman Hunt. Portraits of members of The Clique were commissioned by Patrick Allan-Fraser for Hospitalfield House in Arbroath.

(2014) Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised Edition). Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland. . Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs or stabilization ponds or waste stabilization lagoons) are ponds designed and built for wastewater treatment to reduce the organic content and remove pathogens from wastewater. They are man-made depressions confined by earthen structures. Wastewater or \\"influent\\" enters on one side of the waste stabilization pond and exits on the other side as \\"effluent\\", after spending several days in the pond, during which treatment processes take place. Waste stabilization ponds are used worldwide for wastewater treatment and are especially suitable for developing countries that have warm climates.Pe√±a Var√≥n, M., Mara, D. (2004). Stabilisation ponds. IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre. Delft, The Netherlands. They are frequently used to treat sewage and industrial effluents, but may also be used for treatment of municipal run-off or stormwater. The system may consist of a single pond or several ponds in a series, each pond playing a different role in the removal of pollutants. After treatment, the effluent may be returned to surface water or reused as irrigation water (or reclaimed water) if the effluent meets the required effluent standards (e.g. sufficiently low levels of pathogens). Waste stabilization ponds involve natural treatment processes which take time because removal rates are slow. Therefore, larger areas are required than for other treatment processes with external energy inputs. Waste stabilization ponds described here use no aerators. High-performance lagoon technology that does use aerators has much more in common with the activated sludge process. Such aerated lagoons use less area than is needed for traditional stabilization ponds and are also common in small towns. Fundamentals Waste stabilization pond at Grand Agadir, Morocco (Station M‚Äôzar) Effluent from a high rate algae pond and two maturation ponds in Attaouia, Morocco. Note the green color, caused by algae.  Concept of stabilization  Sewage and many types of industrial wastewaters contain organic matter. If wastewater is discharged untreated into surface water bodies (for instance, rivers and lakes), their organic matter serves as food for microorganisms living in the surface waters. These organisms use the organic matter for energy generation for their growth and reproduction. This is done via their respiration, in which they convert the organic matter into carbon dioxide and water. These stable components do not cause water pollution problems. Therefore this is frequently called \\"stabilization\\" of the organic matter. However, these organisms use oxygen in their respiration, thus reducing the oxygen concentration in the surface waters. This is one of the main water pollution problems, which may affect the surface water biota, including fish. Waste stabilization ponds reproduce these biological phenomena before they take place in the receiving surface water and cause the pollution problems due to oxygen consumption. The ponds receive wastewater, and, by natural processes similar to those that take place in the surface waters, carry out stabilization of the organic matter inside them, as part of the treatment. This is why they received the name of waste stabilization ponds.  Microorganisms  The reactions take place by the joint participation of several microorganisms living within the pond. The organic matter is measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). BOD values in the pond effluent are lower than in the influent, reflecting the removal of organic matter. This pond biome uses organic matter from the wastewater as food. Nutrients are converted to cell material and energy for life processes including reproduction and growth of living cells. Some of these living cells will be consumed by organisms at higher trophic levels within the pond. In ponds, the most important group of microorganisms are bacteria, which utilize most of the organic matter from the wastewater, but also consume oxygen. Algae are another essential group of microorganisms. They do not depend on the organic material from the influent. Instead, they undertake photosynthesis, in which they produce the organic matter for their own consumption and, very importantly here, they release oxygen. The excess oxygen released supports the respiration done by the aerobic organisms in the pond. Atmospheric oxygen is also dissolved into the liquid, which assists in maintaining an aerobic layer on the top of the pond surface.  Oxygen levels  The oxygen concentration varies in the liquid column: Close to the surface, concentrations are high and support the growth of aerobic organisms. Close to the pond bottom, sunlight penetration is low, and thus photosynthetic activity is reduced. This causes oxygen concentrations to be low there. Finally, inside the sediments in the bottom layer, there is no oxygen at all. Here, organic matter is removed by digestion undertaken by anaerobic organisms. Kariba, Zimbabwe (sludge needs to be removed)  Removal of pathogens  Pathogens can be efficiently removed in waste stabilization ponds. The process relies mostly on maturation ponds for removal of pathogens, although some removal also takes place in the other ponds of the system. The higher the number of ponds in the series, the more efficient the pathogen removal. Removal of pathogenic bacteria and viruses occurs mainly by inactivation. Pathogens are inactivated as a result of a complex interaction of mechanisms that involve pH (the pH value in ponds is high because of algal photosynthesis), temperature, ultraviolet radiation present in the sunlight that reaches the pond surface and photooxidative reactions taking advantage of high dissolved oxygen concentrations.Verbyla, M., von Sperling, M., Ynoussa, M. (2017). Waste Stabilization Ponds. In: J.B. Rose and B. Jim√©nez-Cisneros, (eds) Global Water Pathogens Project. (C. Haas, J. Mihelcic and M. Verbyla) (eds). Part 4. Management of Risk from Excreta and Wastewater). Michigan State University, E. Lansing, MI, UNESCO. Protozoan pathogens are present in the wastewater in the form of cysts or oocysts. Helminths (worms) are present in the form of eggs. The protozoan and helminth pathogens can be removed by the mechanism of sedimentation. Very high removal efficiencies may be achieved, especially if maturation ponds are part of the treatment system. In that case, the final pond effluent may be in compliance with World Health Organization guidelines for irrigating with treated wastewaster (or \\"reclaimed water\\").WHO (2006). WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland However, sludge (sediment) from the ponds may be heavily contaminated with helminth eggs, which may survive even after several years of storing the sludge inside of the pond.Stewart M. Oakley, Department of Civil Engineering, California State University:The Need for Wastewater Treatment in Latin America: A Case Study of the Use of Wastewater Stabilization Ponds in Honduras, Small Flows Quarterly Juried Article, Spring 2005, Volume 6, Number 2 Types Main configurations of waste stabilization pond systems. Waste stabilization ponds consist of man-made basins comprising a single or several series of anaerobic, facultative or maturation ponds. The presence or absence of oxygen varies with the three different types of ponds, used in sequence. Anaerobic waste stabilization ponds have very little dissolved oxygen, thus anaerobic conditions prevail. The second type of pond, facultative stabilization ponds, sustain an aerobic surface habitat above an anaerobic benthic habitat. Maturation ponds offer aerobic conditions throughout, from the surface to the bottom. The main configurations of pond systems are:USEPA (2011) Principles of Design and Operations of Wastewater Treatment Pond Systems for Plant Operators, Engineers, and Managers. EPA/600/R-10/088. United States Environmental Protection Agency * Facultative pond only; * Anaerobic pond followed by a facultative pond; * Facultative pond followed by maturation ponds in series; * Anaerobic pond followed by a facultative pond followed by maturation ponds in series. If an anaerobic pond is present, part of the suspended solids from the wastewater settles, thus removing the organic matter (BOD) contributed by these solids. Additionally, some of the dissolved organic matter is removed by anaerobic digestion. During the second stage in the facultative pond, most of the remaining BOD is removed mainly by the heterotrophic bacteria that receive oxygen from the photosynthesis undertaken by algae. The main function of the tertiary stage in maturation ponds is the removal of pathogens, although it may also assist in nutrient reduction (i.e. nitrogen). However, nitrogen fixation by algae living in stabilization pond systems may increase nitrogen levels in stabilization pond effluent. Anaerobic ponds  Anaerobic ponds receive raw wastewater. They have a smaller surface area compared to facultative ponds and are also deeper (usually 3.0 to 5.0 m). The depth decreases the influence of oxygen production by photosynthesis, leading to anaerobic conditions. Depending on loading and climatic conditions, these ponds are able to remove between half to two thirds of the influent BOD. This significantly decreases the load of organic matter that goes to the facultative ponds, and thus decreases their required size. Anaerobic stabilization ponds have the disadvantage of potentially releasing malodorous gases. This especially includes hydrogen sulfide with an odor of rotten eggs, if the system has operational problems. The first pond biome in a series of stabilization ponds digests the putrescible solids suspended in the wastewater being treated. Anaerobic ponds allow solids to settle down at the bottom as sludge. This settling removes a portion of the particulate organic material. A large fraction of the settled solids will accumulate close to the point where wastewater enters the pond. Therefore, anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either aerobic or facultative ponds. The depth decreases the oxygen levels so anaerobic bacteria can efficiently digest the waste. Anaerobic ponds contain anaerobic organisms which are able to break down complex organic waste into basic compounds that are less harmful to the environment.Cincinnati, O. (2010, June 29). NEPIS document display. Because anaerobic organisms can only thrive in warm temperatures, anaerobic ponds are not suitable in temperate or cold climates. Sludge accumulates at the bottom of the anaerobic ponds and needs to be removed every few years. Facultative ponds  Facultative pond in Ruai, Kenya Facultative stabilization ponds that receive raw wastewater are called primary facultative ponds. If they are receiving wastewater that has already been treated in anaerobic ponds, they are called secondary facultative ponds. Facultative stabilization ponds may also be used for treatment following other types of treatment processes such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, oxidation ditches or aerated lagoons. Compared with anaerobic ponds, facultative ponds are shallower (1.5 to 2.5 m deep) and have much larger surface areas. The surface area is important because it allows atmospheric oxygen to dissolve and sunlight radiation to penetrate the water. This allows for photosynthetic activity to occur which produces more oxygen. In most ponds both bacteria and algae are needed in order to maximize the decomposition of organic matter and the removal of other pollutants. Algae produce oxygen (photosynthesis) and also consume oxygen (respiration), but they leave an excess of oxygen that can then be used by aerobic bacteria for respiration and for the processes of oxidation (or stabilization) of the organic matter in the wastewater. Several types of invertebrates are present in the ponds where they control the population of algae, which then settles to the bottom. Heavy algal growth may block sunlight from penetrating into the pond. This decreases the potential for photosynthesis to contribute oxygen to the pond. In the treatment of sewage, systems composed of anaerobic ponds followed by facultative ponds usually have overall BOD removal efficiencies between 75 and 85%. Higher efficiencies are difficult to achieve because the effluent contains high concentrations of particulate organic matter, in the form of algae, naturally produced during treatment. The sludge comprising the sediment layer in the pond undergoes anaerobic digestion, and may accumulate for several years without needing removal. Maturation ponds  Some additional removal of organic matter and other pollutants may be achieved in maturation ponds. These ponds are only included in the treatment line when high efficiencies of pathogen removal are required, either for discharge of the treated effluent in surface water bodies, or for use for irrigation or aquaculture. They are usually used after facultative ponds, but may also follow other treatment processes, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. They could also be placed after an activated sludge process. Maturation ponds must be shallow (around 1.0 m depth or less) with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function. Shallow ponds benefit from high photosynthetic activity arising from the penetration of solar radiation. The pH values are high because of intense photosynthesis, and ultraviolet radiation penetration takes place in the upper layers. Both of these factors promote the removal of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Given the high surface area of the maturation ponds, protozoan cysts and helminth eggs are also removed, with sedimentation as the main mechanism. Sludge accumulation is very low in maturation ponds. Very high pathogen removal efficiencies may be achieved, depending on several factors: temperature, hydraulic retention time (the amount of time the liquid remains in the system - from entrance to exit), the number of ponds in the series, the presence of baffles and the depth of ponds. Maturation ponds may be used in combination with a rainwater reservoir to form an ecological, self- purifying irrigation reservoir.  Application and suitability  Waste stabilization ponds are very efficient in their primary objective of removing organic matter and, under some conditions, pathogenic organisms. Their design criteria have changed very little over the years. Ponds are simple to design, build, operate and maintain, which is very important in remote areas and in developing countries where sophisticated equipment and highly skilled labor is not easily available. Construction may be done by local contractors in small towns. Waste stabilization ponds work well in nearly all environments and can treat most types of wastewater. They are particularly well-suited for tropical and subtropical countries because the intensity of the sunlight and temperature are key factors for the efficiency of the removal processes. Ponds are used throughout the world. In many countries and regions ponds are the most widely used treatment process. For this reason, they are one of the processes recommended by WHO for the treatment of wastewater for reuse in agriculture and aquaculture, especially because of their effectiveness in removing nematodes (worms) and helminth eggs. Ponds cannot achieve very high efficiencies in the removal of organic matter, and usually have low capacities for removing nitrogen and phosphorus. The effluent usually has high concentrations of suspended solids, resulting from algal production in the ponds. Therefore, ponds are not a suitable technology in areas where stringent discharge standards exist, unless additional stages of post treatment are included. Since ponds require large areas, they may not be practical in proximity to towns where land is expensive. A suitable topography and a suitable soil structure are also desired, in order to reduce construction costs.  Operation and maintenance  Regarding operation and maintenance, the tasks performed by the operational staff are very simple and do not require special skills. Additionally, there is no energy consumption for aeration, no need of heavy equipment maintenance and no frequent sludge removal, sludge treatment and disposal. Ponds require very little maintenance, since there is no heavy electric or mechanical equipment that requires attention. The only routine maintenance needed is on the preliminary treatment (cleaning of screens and removal of sand), routine checking of pipes, weirs and other hydraulic structures, and removal of unwanted vegetation growth in embankments.  Sludge removal  Sludge accumulates inside the ponds. It needs to be removed only in the interval of several years. This is an important advantage of the system. However, when removal is necessary, it is usually an expensive and labor-intensive operation. Removal is more frequent in anaerobic ponds (every few years), because of their smaller volume and lower capacity to store the sludge, compared with facultative ponds. In facultative ponds, sludge removal may be necessary only in intervals around 15 to 25 years. In maturation ponds, sludge accumulation is very low. Sludge removal, also called desludging, may be done in two basic ways: (i) interrupting the operation of the pond for desludging or (ii) keeping the pond in operation while desludging. In the first case, the influent wastewater to the pond to be desludged is closed. Afterwards, the pond is drained and the bottom sludge is left for open drying for several weeks. During this period, the wastewater to be treated needs to be diverted to other ponds in the system. After the sludge has dried, its removal may be done manually (very laborious in large ponds) or mechanically using tractors or mechanical scrapers. In the second alternative, when the pond is left in operation during desludging, the removed sludge will be wet and will require further drying. This is undertaken outside the pond. Sludge removal can be by suction and pumping using vacuum trucks (only for small ponds), dredging, pumping from a raft or involving other mechanical equipment. In either case, the amount of sludge to be removed is very high, considering its accumulation over a period of years. This process is very laborious, expensive and requires careful planning.  Costs  In the selection of a wastewater treatment process, besides the technical aspects that are relevant to each alternative, also cost factors play a very important role. The latter can be basically divided into (i) construction costs and (ii) operation and maintenance costs. Waste stabilization ponds are usually considered a cheap alternative in terms of construction costs. However, the final costs will depend essentially on the size of ponds, presence of maturation ponds in the process configuration, topography, soil conditions, groundwater level and land cost. Because all these elements are site-specific, it is difficult to generalize overall construction costs. In most cases these will be lower compared with other wastewater treatment alternatives.Arthur, J.P. (1983). Notes on the design and operation of waste stabilization ponds in warm climates of developing countries. Technical paper No 7. Washington D.C Depending on the specific situation of the area, construction costs can increase and level up with other technologies. Waste stabilization ponds are one of the cheapest wastewater treatment processes in terms of operation and maintenance.  Comparison with other infrastructure  The following types of water and wastewater infrastructure may superficially resemble waste stabilization ponds, but are not the same: * Aerated lagoons rely upon mechanical aerators to provide oxygen to stabilize organic matter. Aerated lagoons may be used as the first stage in the treatment line instead of anaerobic ponds to limit release of malodorous gases, but with energy and maintenance requirements causing higher operating costs. * Constructed wetlands are designed to improve water quality by supporting rooted vegetation arranged to physically remove solids and particulate material while removing soluble nutrients in the water by uptake into plant tissue and supplying oxygen to the water to reduce BOD. * Retention basins are used to manage stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay. Detention basins are similar but are \\"dry ponds\\" designed to temporarily hold runoff as a flood control measure. * Infiltration basins are ponds designed to percolate their contents into underlying permeable soils. * Settling basins are designed to separate solids from wastewaters without provision for treatment of those solids.

Spider and Web begins innocuously enough: the player's character, an apparent tourist, has wandered into a blind alley. Upon trying to leave the alley, however, the character is confronted by a voice sneering that this is a lie and threatening dire consequences if the truth is not told. Gradually, the player pieces together that the main character is an unnamed spy who is being interrogated by an equally anonymous enemy. Through interruptions and prodding, the interrogator reveals that the spy was captured in the process of infiltrating an installation under the guise of a tourist. Most of the commands the player gives are actually part of a story the character is telling to the interrogator. Any part of the story that the interrogator disputes is challenged; the player is executed after a number of these \\"challenges\\".

This photograph was taken in 1874. University College, Bristol was an educational institution which existed from 1876 to 1909. It was the predecessor institution to the University of Bristol, which gained a royal charter in 1909. During its time the college mainly served the middle classes of Bristol, and catered for young men who had entered a family business and needed a greater understanding of scientific topics. Origins John Percival was an early figure in the development of the college who pressed the University of Oxford for support. The history of University College, Bristol and ultimately the University of Bristol can be traced as far back as 1872 and the attempts of John Percival, a local educationalist and headmaster of Clifton College, to press for the creation of a college. Percival was a supporter of the education of women, having founded an Association for the Promotion of the Higher Education of Women in 1868,http://www.bristolreads.com/downloads/readers_guide/bristol_education.doc and an Association for the Promotion of Evening Classes a year later. Percival's strong Christian religious views (he later became a bishop) influenced his views on education, in that he believed that opportunities should be available to both males and females irrespective of their declared faith.J.W. Shelborne p4 He is credited with the initial idea that there should be a university in Bristol.Cartleton 1984 p1 Lewis Fry, a later influence on the college and the subsequent university, is quoted as saying that it was to Pervical that they owed the foundation of the college. In 1872 Percival wrote a letter to the Oxford colleges noting the lack of a university culture in the provinces. He also canvassed support when Bristol Medical School was looking for a new building and in 1873 he suggested to the Medical School Council that they both approach the Bristol Museum and Library Society to attempt to establish a college.University College, Bristol 1876‚Äì1909, J.W. Shelborne, p5 This allowed the creation of a committee to promote the scheme led by the dean of Bristol, which contained prominent Bristol politicians from the Liberal and Conservative Parties and members representing local industry.J.W. Shelborne p5 It was in July 1876 that the medical school agreed to affiliate with the college in return for the promise that it would be supplied with additional space to expand, a promise which was eventually honoured three years later. This building now houses the University of Bristol's Department of Geography. In 1873 Percival wrote a pamphlet entitled The Connection of the Universities and the Great Towns which was met with a positive response from Benjamin Jowett, a connection of Percival, who at this time was the Master of Balliol College. His promise of sponsorship initially helped the project. It was Percival's connections with the colleges of the Oxford which helped in lobbying for the creation of the university. Percival was able to agree that the Master of Balliol College would subscribe ¬£300 to the project, on the terms that adult education was catered for and that the college catered for the arts as well as the sciences. Benjamin Jowett was an early influence on the college. Later, he was to donate some of his own personal wealth to the college. On 11 June 1874 the Victoria Rooms hosted a meeting to promote what was described as a College of Science and Literature for the West of England and South Wales. The meeting was attended by the then president of the British Association and Sir William Thompson (later Lord Kelvin). This meeting has been described as a partial success, as it gained the support of Albert Fry and Lewis Fry,Carleton 1984 p3 members of the influential Fry family (the Fry name being known for the chocolate business set up by their grandfather and developed by their father Joseph Storrs Fry). Lewis Fry was a Quaker, lawyer and later a Liberal and Unionist Member of Parliament from 1885 to 1892 and 1895 to 1890 for the constituency Bristol North. Albert Fry also gained distinction as the founder of the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works Co. However, the fact that the project attracted large numbers of Quakers, Non-Conformists and Liberals meant that the project was labelled as such an institution. Tories made some initial grants to the project but soon focused their interest on a rival institution through the Society of Merchant Venturers which was considered mostly Conservative in politics. Ironically, the Society of Merchant Venturers, which was to become a rival institution during much of the college's history, made a gift of ¬£1000 at this point. Despite this initial donation, a lack of funds was to plague University College, Bristol up until the donations which allowed it to lobby for a royal charter. Initially the financial response to the meeting was disappointing, with the college gaining only ¬£25,991 of the ¬£40,000 funds which it asked for. It was at this stage that the Wills family became involved in the project with Henry Overton Wills donating ¬£250 to the project. The lacklustre response to the call for funds had the immediate result of delaying the opening of the college until 1876, and meant that when it did open it was under the most stringent financial conditions. Shelborne notes that the setting up of the college struggled due to the fact that Bristol lacked a significant industry which saw benefit in the creation a college, an absence of the nouveaux riches, and no philanthropic industrialists who wished to highlight the importance of Bristol.University College, Bristol 1876‚Äì1909, J.W. Sherborne, p7 Opening of University College, Bristol Alfred Marshall was the first principal of the college, he was later an economist and teacher to John Maynard Keynes. University College, Bristol opened on Tuesday 10 October 1876 at 9.00 a.m. with a mathematics lecture by W. R. Bousfield, who also lectured in higher maths an hour later.J.W. Shelborne p1 The charges for such a course were three guineas for two lectures each week during the Christmas and Easter terms; a student also had to pay 7s as an entrance fee to enroll.University College, Bristol 1876‚Äì1909, J.W. Sherborne, p1 At its opening in 1876, two professors and five lecturers offered lectures in fifteen subject areas.Early Days: Departmental History: Earth Sciences: University of Bristol The college was situated at 32 Park Row and was rented for ¬£50 per annum. As requested by Jowett when giving money, the college was open to men and women on the same basis (except in medicine),J.W. Sherborne, p2 The college offered scholarships, the most valuable of which was one in chemistry worth ¬£25. General scholarships of ¬£15 were also available. Despite the label of 'University' however, the institution did not have the power to award degrees to its students. There were, however, links with the University of London which allowed the external sitting of these examinations and the Cambridge Local Higher Examinations useful for those who wished to become teachers. During the first year 30 men and 69 women registered for classes, and there were 238 evening classes, which cost five shillings with a registration fee of one shilling. The buildings rented were used by the college as a deaf and dumb institute. In its early years the college was very poor. The college had raised ¬£23,437, just short of the ¬£25,000 that it was suggested was required at the Victoria Rooms meeting, but in reality this sum fell well short of what would be sufficient. Much of the college's initial money was spent on acquiring land such as that beside Rifle Drill Hall, next to where Bristol Grammar School now stands.Cartleton 1984 p7 Several lecturers at the college achieved reputations in their own subject fields, including Henry Selby Hele- Shaw (Engineering), Silvanus Thompson (Physics), and William Johnson Sollas (Geography). The college lacked any kind of formal syllabus. Students' reasons for entering the college were varied, with some, such as G.H. Leonard (who later became a professor at the University of Bristol), using their time there as preparation for the Cambridge scholarship examination. One female student is said to have attended \\"in order to improve after dinner conversation\\".Cartleton 1984 p5 However, by the 1880s University College, Bristol could be said to be producing its first graduates. Jowett's connections with Alfred Marshall allowed him to pick Marshall as the first principal of the college. Marshall is now considered one of the most dominant figures in world economics at the beginning of the 20th century. Marshall came to Bristol as a result of his marriage to one of his students Mary Paley at St. John's, which required his immediate resignation of his fellowship there in Moral Science. Marshall taught evening classes to young businessmen while his wife taught during the day to ladies. Her salary was deducted from his wages. Today Alfred Marshall has a building of the University of Bristol named after him in recognition of his early influence on the foundation of the university. William Ramsay, seen here in later life, was the second principal of the college. Today he is known for his discovery of the noble gases. Marshall stated his intention to leave in 1879 and was talked out of resigning, but he eventually did so in 1881 during a period of acute financial struggle for the college. Marshall's reasons for resignation were varied; he found the nature of the job left little time for the reflection needed to pursue his academic work, and he preferred academia to administration. The financial situation of the college played a part, and he found the need to \\"beg\\" to maintain the institution's finances distasteful. There was an obvious successor to the position of principal, with chemistry professor William Ramsay replacing Marshall in the post. Ramsay is said to have brought great energy to the talk of improving the college.Carleton 1984 p9 He embarked on a round of after-dinner parties to promote the college, and in 1883 he was able to build a purpose-built laboratory. In 1884 the college came close to bankruptcy when the treasurer announced that funds would dry up within two months. The college survived, but two professors were given notice of dismissal and their departments were placed on a self-supporting notice. At this time Welsh colleges were able to receive financial support but not English ones, so English colleges therefore decided to lobby the Government for funding. The result was that English colleges would receive a grant of ¬£15000, of which Bristol gained the modest share of ¬£1,200. Ramsay resigned his post in 1887 after being appointed chair of chemistry at University College, London. Although no longer principal, after his resignation he used his influence to lobby the college council to appoint his assistant Morris Travers to the chair of chemistry when the position became vacant. Travers is credited with pushing forward the Charter campaign during the beginning of the 20th century. When Conwy Lloyd Morgan was appointed he was only given the lesser title of Dean of University College, Bristol, and it was only in 1891 when finances had improved that he was given the title of principal. Morgan had come to Bristol in 1884 from a post in Cape Town, South Africa. Today he is considered to be one of the first experimental psychologists, but he came to Bristol to replace the geology teacher William Johnson Sollas. He is considered to have coined much of the terminology regarding contemporary animal science. At Bristol he became fully involved in the campaign to gain the college a royal charter. The financial problems of the college were based upon the fact that there had been a failure to find a 'local Carnegie' ‚Äì a business magnate who could finance the university by providing endowments and financing the payment of staff. The passing of the Technical Instruction Act empowered local authorities to level a rate for technical instruction. Bristol was able to apply for a further ¬£2,000 in funds and a further ¬£500 was gained in return for an agreement that free places would be made available to some students. This money was used to build an Engineering block. A few months earlier the Medical School building had been finished and formally incorporated into the college. It was not until 1899 that the college began to receive any kind of state funding, leading one lecturer to joke that the motto of the college should be not Knowledge is power but College is poor; until this time the college was wholly dependent upon the student fees paid for the courses. However, the college was expanded as finances allowed during the 1890s after it had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy several times the decade before. By 1897 some anxiety was caused by the opening of a Bristol Technical College which began to draw some of the students who would have attended University College, Bristol. However, it is argued that this threat was more imaginary than real as the University College was able to cater for more academic interests. Campaign for a royal charter Lord Haldane was a key figure in the move to create a university. He later served as a chancellor of the University of Bristol. At the turn of the century the chances of the college gaining a royal charter seemed a distant prospect. Many on the College Council were aware of the need to progress and achieve greater financial support including Lewis Fry. They were aware that was it not for the anonymous donations made to the college (by a Mr Fenwick Richards) during the last century there would have been bankruptcy. The establishment of the University Colston Society (named after one of Bristol's great benefactors Edward Colston) was the impetus for the campaign to create a university for Bristol and the West of England. It was non-political and was aimed at shaking off the image that the college was a Liberal institution as it was recognised broad political support needed to be generated in order for the plan to become a university to succeed.Cartleton 1984 p13 The first Society Dinner was held on 7 December 1899 with the guest speaker James Byrce (later Viscount Bryce). In 1900 a committee was set under the chairmanship of the Bishop of Bristol. However, the committee only ever had one meeting after the first resulted in the announcement that a report into the viability of a university for Bristol would require a Registrar at a cost of ¬£1000 per annum.Cartleton 1984 p14 There was some debate as to whether an autonomous University should be formed for Bristol and the West of England or whether a federal organisation should be created which included University College, Bristol as well as Merchant Venturers' Technical College as possibly the colleges of Reading, Exeter and Southampton. Lord Haldane had proposed the idea of a federal university as a compromise but it failed to increase support. Morris Travers who gained the post of lecture in chemistry at the college is generally credited with pushing forward the campaign to gain a charter by courting the local press and pressing for the support of the Fry brothers who held power on the City power continuously from 1882 and 1909. There is evidence that Marshall had told Travers to reject the compromise idea of a federal university and push for a Bristol university. Travers spoke to Lewis Fry head of the College Council on 1 February 1905 and was able to make Fry write to relatives to increase support. Lewis Fry was able to get the Conservative chairman of the City Education Committee to agree to the idea of setting up a university. Travers wrote pamphlets advocating the university and editorials were written for the Bristol Times supporting the university. By 1905 it could be stated that the national government were supportive of the idea of setting up a university in Bristol. Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen's Rd at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able to eavesdrop and hear the conversation which stated that the trustees were preparing to sell.Cartleton 1984 p19 Although with a price of ¬£40,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the college could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (¬£10,000), cousin Francis Fry (¬£5,000), Sir William Henry Wills (¬£10,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (¬£5,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families personal estate was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land. The second fortunate event occurred in January 1906 when the Merchant Venturers' Technical College was destroyed by fire. The Merchant Venturers saw University College, Bristol as dominated by Liberals and therefore supported the Bristol Trade School instead. The fire made the organisation worried about its future and removed any objection which they would have to the creation of a university. Henry Wills made a donation of ¬£100,000 to the creation of the University of Bristol. In 1906 a committee to promote the creation of the university was established. Lewis Fry was able to announce that ¬£30,000 as an endowment fund was to be given by Lord Winterstoke (a member of the Wills Family). The Merchant Venturers had negotiations to join with the college but were unable to a complete amalgamation wanted to retain some autonomy. There was another setback when Travers left the project to work on the setting up of an Indian Research Institution in Bangalore. Travers can be credited with significantly moving forward the project but the issue of finances remained still remained. On 14 January 1908 at the annual College Colston society dinner George Alfred Wills rose to his feet and dramatically announced the news that his father, Henry Overton, was to donate ¬£100,000 to the cause promoting the creation of the university providing that a royal charter was obtained within two years. Records note that the room began to cheer after the announcement was made.University College, Bristol 1876‚Äì1909, J.W. Sherborne, p23 This announcement caused further funds to be promised by those attending the university. The day ended with the university endowment fund standing at five times greater than it had at the start with the university scheme attracting more in 24-hours than it did in its entire history.Cartleton 1984 p23 The raising of such large firms meant that the Privy Council could not argue that the creation of what were then disparagingly known as 'Lilliputian' Universities would in any way result in a decrease in the standard of British universities. H.O. Wills had little contact with the college apart from the fact that he had sent his son Harry to classes there. He died in 1911 after becoming the first chancellor of the University of Bristol. The Wills Memorial Building was built by his two surviving sons in memory at a cost of ¬£500,000. The impact of the Wills family upon the university can also be founding in the naming of the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory built by George in memory of his brother which cost some ¬£200,000 and the building of Wills Hall, a hall of residence for the university in Stoke Bishop. Unlike many of the supporters of the university the Wills were not Liberals or Quakers but Congregationalists. Later an agreement with the Merchant Venturers was made with the organisation being merged with the college's Engineering Department to create a new Faculty of Engineering. All teaching was to take place in the Merchant Venturers Building. The principal Julius Wertheimer was left with little bargaining power after the destruction of his own institutions buildings. As government funding was linked to endowment this massive endowment created further wealth for the college. Later in 1908 a petition was presented to the Privy Council representing the views of the University Committee. On 24 May 1909 Bristol University, as it then became known, gained its royal charter allowing it to award degrees after the king in Privy Council assented to the creation of a university. Flags were flown from public buildings in Bristol and the city's church bells hang out on receiving the news.Cartleton 1984 p24 List of principals University College, Bristol existed from 1877 to 1909, after which it became the University of Bristol. * Alfred Marshall (1877‚Äì1881) ‚Äì Marshall was also a lecturer on political economy.

Storkyrkan lies in the centre of Stockholm in Gamla stan, between Stockholm Palace and Stortorget, the old main square of Stockholm. It was inaugurated in 1306 but construction of the church probably started in the 13th century. Inside, Storkyrkan still maintains much of its late medieval appearance in the form of a hall church with a vaulted ceiling supported by brick pillars. The exterior of the church is however uniformly Baroque in appearance, the result of extensive changes made in the 18th century. During the Middle Ages, it was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, but after the Reformation in Sweden ‚Äì in which the church played an important role as the place where Mass was celebrated in Swedish for the first time ‚Äì it has been a Lutheran church, not formally dedicated to any saint. It currently serves as the seat of the Bishop of Stockholm within the Church of Sweden since the creation of the Diocese of Stockholm in 1942. Storkyrkan was for a long time the only parish church of Stockholm, and from an early date it was connected with the Swedish royal family. It has been the scene of historical events on numerous occasions, and was used as a coronation church for centuries. More recently, the wedding between Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling took place in the church in 2010. Military victories as well as national tragedies have been commemorated in Storkyrkan, and it is still used for funerals of public figures such as the writers Astrid Lindgren and Sara Danius. The church contains several important works of art as well as elaborate furnishings, among these a late medieval sculpture of Saint George and the Dragon and V√§dersolstavlan, a painting which shows one of the earliest images of Stockholm. Location and surroundings Storkyrkan visible at the end of Slottsbacken from across the water. The church is part of a coherent ensemble of Baroque architecture surrounding Stockholm Palace. Storkyrkan is the oldest church in Stockholm and was originally the parish church of the entire city, and as such was built at the very centre of the medieval city. It lies at the highest point of Gamla stan, wedged between the Stock Exchange Building and Stockholm Palace. The church, together with the palace, Stortorget and the first town hall of Stockholm (located on the site of the present stock exchange building), formed the heart of the earliest urban development. While the interior of the church still retains much of its medieval appearance, the exterior of the church is largely the result of changes made in the 18th century. Together with the Royal Palace, the Axel Oxenstierna palace, Slottsbacken and its obelisk, and the Tessin Palace, it is part of a coherent ensemble of Baroque architecture. It has been described as an \\"irreplaceable\\" part of the cityscape of Stockholm. Storkyrkan is surrounded on three sides by streets (Tr√•ngsund to the west, Storkyrkobrinken and H√∂gvaktsterrassen to the north and Slottsbacken to the east). A courtyard is located immediately south of the church. On the opposite side the courtyard faces the back of the stock exchange buildings, and two small pavilions, designed by Erik Palmstedt as wings of the stock exchange, were actually built as the burial chapel and coach-house of the church. They were built in 1767. To the west and east the courtyard is limited by walls, with openings through wrought iron gates. The posts of both gates were originally decorated with allegorical statues, although only the couple on the west gate are still in place. These two statues probably depict Reason (on the south post) and Divine Love (on the north post), and were made by Peter Schultz in 1675. The statues formerly on the posts of the east gate depict females symbolising Caution and Hope. The pair was made in 1702 by . Another statue, depicting the Swedish reformer Olaus Petri, stands adjacent to the east facade of the church. It faces Slottsbacken and forms part of the church ensemble even though it is not formally connected to Storkyrkan. It was inaugurated in 1898 and made by . In the pavement next to the east facade there are also lines which mark the former extent of a church choir, demolished during the reign of King Gustav Vasa. History of the building=Middle Ages The west facade of Storkyrkan as it appeared in 1732, showing its still largely medieval exterior. Storkyrkan was first mentioned in written sources in 1279. The consecration of a church is furthermore attested in 1306, making it the oldest church in Stockholm. The earliest history of the church is thus somewhat unclear: Stockholm was founded in the middle of the 13th century and it has been considered unlikely that the city would not have a functioning church until 1306. Tradition also holds that Birger Jarl founded the church. It is therefore possible that the church inaugurated in 1306 was preceded by another church, or that it was under construction for a long time, or perhaps re- dedicated in 1306. Regardless, the oldest parts of the current building probably belong to the church which was inaugurated in 1306. During the entire Middle Ages, the main patron saint of the church was Saint Nicholas. Several churches in the Baltic region from the 13th century are dedicated to Saint Nicholas, especially in cities where the Hanseatic League had a presence, as was the case in Stockholm. The church was also dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Eric. The church remained the only parish church of Stockholm, serving the entire city, until the 1590s. In general, the medieval history of the church building is complex and difficult to determine in detail. There are few written sources, and a lack of ornaments has made it difficult to draw any conclusions about the age of the different parts on stylistic grounds. Originally, the church appears to have consisted of a nave with two aisles. It had a wooden ceiling supported by six pillars. The building material was brick. The main entrance was probably located to the west, though side entrances may have existed in the north and south walls. Stylistically, the church was part of a group of brick churches built in the area around Lake M√§laren at the time, including Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral, St. Mary's Church, Sigtuna and . The church was successively rebuilt and enlarged during the 14th and 15th centuries. Embellishing the church was a way for both the monarchs of Sweden and the citizens of Stockholm to demonstrate their power and influence. Medieval vault paintings from 1346 (later restored) in what used to be the first chapel of the church, dedicated to Saint Mary. A donation to the church in 1346 by King Magnus IV and his wife Blanche of Namur probably indicates that the first of a number of chapels had been added to the church. This chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Mary and was located at the south side of the east end of the church. The four bays that belonged to the chapel are still discernible in the interior of Storkyrkan. Similar chapels were built at approximately the same time at Visby Cathedral and St. Mary's Church, L√ºbeck. The chapel was decorated with Early Gothic murals in a style unusual for Swedish churches (later heavily restored). A second chapel was added to the church sometime before 1361, and further chapels were built during the early 15th century. By the end of the Middle Ages, Storkyrkan contained more than 30 chapels or specifically dedicated altarpieces, an amount only comparable with the cathedrals of medieval Sweden. The church thus grew piecemeal by the addition of chapels. Another set of murals, painted by Albertus Pictor and decorating the south west vaults (the paintings are currently not visible from the floor of the church) was also added during the 15th century. Between 1474 and 1496, a major reconstruction of the church was carried out which then incorporated these chapels into a single, unified space and installed new vaults, creating a uniformly high ceiling. The church was at approximately the same time also substantially expanded toward the east, while a choir was also added. This was partially because the church had become too small for the growing population of the city. The choir was demolished during the 16th century. The tower was also built in the early 15th century and was originally intended mainly as a defensive tower. By the end of the 15th century Storkyrkan had acquired the basic shape and size that it still has. Reformation and later changes During the 16th century, the Reformation in Sweden led to important changes for the church. Catholicism was abandoned and Lutheranism was adopted. The state confiscated much of the property of the church, including large amounts of silver from the chapels and altars of Storkyrkan. Although Sweden as a whole did not suffer from any extensive outbreaks of iconoclasm during the Reformation, some of the formerly Catholic sculptures of the church were vandalised. When Christian II of Denmark resided in Stockholm in 1520, the church was fortified, a reflection of the political tensions which, among other things, led to the Stockholm Bloodbath in 1521. Adam van D√ºren was responsible for these works, and he also made an allegorical sculpture adorning the base of one of the pillars of the church. It depicts a male and a female lion and an eel, together with a satirical inscription of dubious meaning. Some further changes to the pillars, vaults and walls of the church were made during the reign of King John III in order to further harmonise the interior space. Changes during the 18th century The fourth and final proposal by Carlberg for a new church spire During the 18th century, the facade of Storkyrkan underwent far-reaching changes. The medieval exterior was completely transformed into a Baroque exterior. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger had put forward a proposal to remake the facade in a more contemporary style. In 1736, Johan Eberhard Carlberg was employed to oversee repairs of the church tower. Relatively soon, the commission expanded to a complete overhaul of the exterior and a new tower spire. Both Carlberg and Carl H√•rleman, who had succeeded Nicodemus Tessin the Younger as architect of the Royal Palace, instantly produced numerous proposals for a new tower spire, further indicating that the idea of modernising the exterior had been entertained for some time. Particularly H√•rleman seems to have viewed the issue from the standpoint that the church should be stylistically incorporated in the palace surroundings. The two architects accused each other's designs for the church spire to have technical problems. In the end, Carlberg's fourth proposal for a new spire, which was a compromise between his own and H√•rleman's ideas, was adopted and Carlberg also designed the other changes to the facade. This transformation of the exterior of the church from a Gothic to a Baroque building was carried out between 1736 and 1745. The exterior seen today is still largely the result of Carlberg's work. Further changes were made later in the same century, when architect Erik Palmstedt in 1777 redesigned the south side of the church courtyard in connection with the building of the stock exchange building on Stortorget. At the same time, he also designed the stairwell attached to the south side of the tower, at the west end of the church; the stairwell was finished in 1778. These and some other additions, later demolished, further underlined the Classical appearance of the church and its surroundings, in contrast to its medieval roots. King Gustav III of Sweden wanted to go even further, demolish the entire church and replace it with a new church inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Later history The windows were equipped with new, wrought-iron tracery in Neo- Gothic style in the 1860s. Some further changes, not least in order to increase the fire safety of the church, were carried out during the late 19th century. A more thorough renovation was done in 1903‚Äì1909 under the guidance of architect Ernst Stenhammar. Among other things, the whitewash which had covered the brick pillars and walls was removed, and the interior has been characterised by the exposed brick since then. It was done as an attempt to recreate a more \\"medieval\\" interior, but in fact the interior had probably always been whitewashed. Another comprehensive renovation was carried out 1952‚Äì54. The church was raised to the status of cathedral for the newly formed Diocese of Stockholm in 1942. Historical significance and royal connections Gustav III in Storkyrkan in 1772, painting by Carl Gustaf Pilo The wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling in Storkyrkan in 2010 Trophies from the Battle of Svensksund carried into Storkyrkan (1790), painting by Pehr Hillestr√∂m Storkyrkan has been the venue of important events in the history of Sweden. The growing wealth and influence of Stockholm during the Middle Ages, and the church's vicinity to the Royal Palace, attracted the attention of both the Archbishop of Uppsala and the monarchs of Sweden. The archbishop occasionally appointed a special representative to the church, and frequently intervened in local church matters. On at least one occasion, in 1338, a bishop (Hemming of Turku) was ordained in Storkyrkan. The Reformation in Sweden was at least partly born in Storkyrkan: it was here that Lutheranism was publicly preached for the first time in Sweden and Storkyrkan was at the same time the first church in Sweden where Mass was celebrated in Swedish (instead of Latin), in 1525. One of the main advocates of the Reformation in Sweden, Olaus Petri, then served as a priest in Storkyrkan. As Storkyrkan from then on was used exclusively by the Swedish-speaking congregation of Stockholm, the sizeable German and Finnish- speaking congregations also moved out to the German Church and a chapel in the town hall, respectively. The church has been used for the coronation of kings and queens of Sweden on several occasions. The first royal coronation that took place in Storkyrkan was the coronation of Magnus IV and Blanche of Namur in 1336. The coronation was conducted by , Bishop of Tartu, in the presence of all Swedish bishops. Most medieval coronations however took place in Uppsala Cathedral. The next time a coronation took place in Storkyrkan was in 1497, when King John was crowned King of Sweden there, during the Kalmar Union. His son Christian II of Denmark was crowned in Storkyrkan on 4 November 1521 in a ceremony designed to mark the submission of Sweden to the rule of King Christian. During the ceremony, representatives of Emperor Charles V presented the king with the Order of the Golden Fleece. Just a few days later, the Stockholm Bloodbath took place. For some time it was then considered inauspicious for ruling monarchs to be crowned in Storkyrkan. However, the wedding between King Eric XIV of Sweden and Karin M√•nsdotter, as well as her coronation following the wedding, took place in Storkyrkan in 1568. Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg was also crowned as Queen of Sweden in Storkyrkan, following her marriage to King Gustavus Adolphus in 1620. The next ruling monarch to be crowned in Storkyrkan was, after a hiatus of 130 years, Queen Christina, in 1650. The coronation of the next two kings were in Uppsala, but King Charles XII again preferred Storkyrkan for his coronation in 1697. The coronation of King Frederick I was also conducted in Storkyrkan, in 1720. From then on the coronations of all Swedish monarchs, with the exception of Gustav IV Adolf, took place in Storkyrkan. The last coronation of a Swedish monarch was that of King Oscar II in 1873, which took place in Storkyrkan. The church has been used for royal weddings on several occasions. Two of the daughters of King Gustav Vasa were married in Storkyrkan, as well as the son of King John III. The wedding between the future King Oscar I and Josephine of Leuchtenberg took place in Storkyrkan in 1823, and several other members of the royal family were married in the church during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2010, Storkyrkan was the venue for the wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling. While Storkyrkan has rarely been used as a burial church for royalty (instead, Riddarholmen Church fulfilled that role until 1950), a number of high-profile funerals have taken place in Storkyrkan during the 20th century. After the bodies of the three members of the failed Andr√©e's Arctic balloon expedition (Salomon August Andr√©e, Knut Fr√¶nkel and Nils Strindberg) were retrieved and returned to Stockholm in 1930, their funeral was held in Storkyrkan. More recently, the funerals of writer Astrid Lindgren (died 2002) and of the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Sara Danius (died 2019) were also held in Storkyrkan. When MS Estonia sank in 1994 with the loss of many Swedish lives, a memorial service, attended by the royal family and the Prime Minister of Sweden, was held in Storkyrkan. Similarly, the church hosted an extra service after the assassination of foreign minister Anna Lindh in 2003. Storkyrkan has also been used for other public events. Several military victories were publicly celebrated in the church during the time of the Swedish Empire. The most elaborate of these was probably the celebration of the victory at the Battle of Narva (1700). The victories at Pu≈Çtusk (1703), Thorn (1703) and Svensksund (1790) were also publicly celebrated in the church. During the time of the Riksdag of the Estates, the estate of the clergy usually held their meetings in Storkyrkan. Still today, a sermon in Storkyrkan traditionally marks the opening of the Riksdag every autumn. During the Middle Ages the church was also used for meetings of the city council of Stockholm. Architecture View of the nave from the entrance towards east Rib vaults in two of the central bays Exterior The building material of the church is brick. The base of the church is strengthened with sandstone and granite. Storkyrkan is \\"of modest proportions\\"; it is long and wide. The exterior of the church is uniformly Baroque, and only the stairwell added by Palmstedt is in a slightly different style. The north and south facades are divided by buttresses treated as pilasters. Otherwise, the elements of the exterior are oriented horizontally rather than vertically. The tower and the gables of the church are decorated with pilasters and mouldings, in a simplified version of Carlberg's original proposal. At the south east corner of the church, a sundial from the 16th century is attached to the wall. A large memorial plaque with an inscription in Latin is placed in the middle of the east wall of the church, commemorating the rebuilding of the church in the 18th century. 28 windows supply the interior with light. The main entrance is in the base of the tower at the west end of the church. Another entrance is located in the north wall, and there are two lesser entrances to the south. Interior Storkyrkan is a hall church, five bays wide and eight bays long. The plan is that of an irregular rectangle, as the form of the building had to be adapted to pre-existing adjacent streets. Brick vaults supported by pillars and richly articulated compound piers cover the entire interior. The eight central bays are covered with rib vaults of a complex and unusual design. The rest of the church has groin vaults. The interior space is divided by the central nave, with open benches on either side. The choir floor is three steps higher than the rest of the church and limited by wrought iron fences to the north and south. Three galleries are placed in the west of the interior, one of which contains the church organ. Most of the windows are clear, but the north westernmost window is decorated with stained glass made by Einar Forseth in the 20th century. The stained glass rose window in the east wall was donated to the church in 1858. It was made in France. Furnishings=Altarpiece The silver altarpiece The main altarpiece of Storkyrkan is the so-called silver altarpiece (). It was donated by Margareta Pedersdotter, widow of Johan Adler Salvius, in 1652. The altarpiece consists of a central part and two wings; the wings were made somewhat later than the middle section. The Baroque altarpiece was made in the workshop of Eustachius Erdm√ºller in Hamburg. It is made of ebony and silver. The central part is divided into three levels above a predella and surmounted by a statuette of the resurrected Christ. Each of the levels contains a panel with a silver relief. The reliefs depict, from bottom to top, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and Christ in realm of the dead. The relief on the predella depicts the Last Supper. The relief depicting the Crucifixion is the largest, and its composition may have been inspired by the painting Christ on the Cross by Peter Paul Rubens from 1620. Free-standing silver statuettes flank the central panels. Moses and John the Baptist flank the Crucifixion panel. The second and third panel are flanked by the Four Evangelists. During the Middle Ages, the church possessed several additional altarpieces. Some of these have been preserved in other locations. The altarpiece currently in Bogl√∂sa Church in Uppland was made for Storkyrkan in the 15th century but sold sometime between 1478 and 1481. The altarpiece currently in J√§der Church in S√∂dermanland originally also belonged to Storkyrkan. A third altarpiece, made in L√ºbeck in 1468, probably by Hermen Rode, is preserved in the Swedish History Museum. Another altarpiece was donated to Storkyrkan in 1629 by Carl Gyllenhielm, who had taken it as loot from Braniewo in present-day Poland. After the silver altarpiece was installed, Gyllenhielm's altarpiece became redundant and was eventually given away. Only the central part of it still exists, and is today located in in Sm√•land. Saint George and the Dragon Saint George and the Dragon North of the choir stands a large, late medieval equestrian statue depicting the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. It has been described as \\"the most impressive medieval piece of art\\" as well as \\"the most curious memorial\\" in Storkyrkan. The statue is around tall and depicts the saint on horseback, fighting the dragon. A subsidiary group shows the princess that the saint is rescuing from the dragon, accompanied by the symbolic Lamb of God. The plinth is furthermore decorated with scenes from the legend of Saint George. It was commissioned by regent Sten Sture the Elder as a funerary monument for him and his wife, after his victory over Danish troops at the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471. Sten Sture had prayed to the saint to protect the army during the battle. The sculpture was inaugurated in 1489. Saint George and the Dragon does not carry any signature, but is widely attributed to Bernt Notke, both on stylistic grounds and by deduction from archival sources. The sculpture has been interpreted, and was probably intended, as not only a religious work of art, but also as a political as well as a personal monument to Sten Sture and his victory over the Danish army. Other medieval furnishings The church is also in possession of a crucifix, possibly also made by Notke or an artist working in the same tradition. The crucifix is made of oak and has lost its earlier polychromy. It was probably made some time between 1475 and 1500. A rood cross made 1400 previously belonged to Storkyrkan but is today on display at the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. The baptismal font of the church was made in 1514, according to an inscription on its side. It belongs to a group of baptismal fonts, similar in style, found in central and northern Sweden. It is made of limestone from Uppland. A tall seven-branched bronze candelabrum, probably made at the end of the 15th century, belongs to the church. It is decorated with sculptures of lions at its foot, and with two human faces on the shaft. Such candelabra are unusual in Sweden (another example exists in Lund Cathedral) but more common in Germany, where it was probably made. In 1564, the helmet and spurs of Saint Olaf, the oldest preserved war trophies taken by Swedish troops, were put on display in Storkyrkan. In the 1860s they were moved to the Swedish History Museum. V√§dersolstavlan V√§dersolstavlan The oldest known depiction of Stockholm in colour is the so-called V√§dersolstavlan (The sun dog painting), which was donated to the church in 1535 by Olaus Magnus. It was painted by Urban m√•lare. The currently visible painting is however a copy from 1636, made by Jacob Heinrich Elbfas; judging from building details in the painting, it appears to be a faithful reproduction. The painting depicts Stockholm as it appeared in the early 16th century, and above it a sun dog, an atmospheric optical phenomenon, observed over Stockholm on 20 April 1535. The painting was restored in 1998‚Äì99. Other paintings Storkyrkan houses two monumental paintings by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl, The Crucifixion and The Last Judgment, painted in 1695 and 1696 respectively. They were originally intended to be displayed in the Royal Chapel at Tre Kronor but were saved from the fire which destroyed the castle and instead put on display in Storkyrkan. The Crucifixion is tall, The Last Judgment more than . Among the other paintings in the church, there is an epitaph taken as war loot from Frombork in 1626 and a 17th-century Russian icon of Saint Nicholas probably made in Moscow, which was seized by Swedish troops after a battle in 1703 and donated to the church by General . Royal pews and pulpit One of the royal pews The pulpit of the church is attached to one of the pillars on the north side of the nave. It was designed and constructed by Burchard Precht between 1698 and 1702. It is made of gilt wood and decorated with mouldings and reliefs. One bay east of the pulpit are the two royal pews, one attached to the north and the other to the south pillar of the nave. They are made of two parts. The lower is a seating area closed in by a decorated wooden barrier. Originally a throne was placed in each of the pews. The upper part of each pew is a gilt wooden canopy in the form of an oversize royal crown carried by angelic sculptures against a background in the form of an imitated drapery. The royal pews, intended for the royal family, were designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and constructed by Burchard Precht. Graves and funerary monuments Until the practice was abolished during the 19th century, burials within the church were considered prestigious and led to the church being crowded with graves. The church still contains a large number of decorated graves and other funerary monuments. Among these, the graves of the family of Jesper Mattson Cruus af Edeby and the grave of Johan Adler Salvius are among the most elaborate. There is also a profusion of memorial plaques attached to the walls; the one celebrating the memory of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and Carl Gustav Tessin is one of the more recent, made by sculptor Carl Milles. Votive ship One of the oldest votive ships in the world comes from Storkyrkan. It dates from the 17th century and is today kept in the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. A copy hangs in the church. Music The organ of Storkyrkan dates from 1960, and was made by Marcussen & S√∏n in Denmark. The facade of the organ was designed in 1789 and is three bays wide. The church has been used as a concert venue since the end of the 18th century. Today the church has four choirs. One of these, Storkyrkans Gossk√∂r (Storkyrkan's Boys Choir) traces its roots to the 17th century. At least two organists of Storkyrkan were also composers; Ferdinand Zellbell the Younger (1719‚Äì1780) and Harald Frykl√∂f (1882‚Äì1918).

He was the heir-presumptive for most of his elder brother Alexander I's reign, but had secretly renounced his claim to the throne in 1823. For 25 days after the death of Alexander I, from 19 November (O.S.)/1 December 1825 to 14 December (O.S.)/26 December 1825 he was known as His Imperial Majesty Konstantin I Emperor and Sovereign of Russia, although he never reigned and never acceded to the throne. His younger brother Nicholas became Tsar in 1825. The succession controversy became the pretext of the Decembrist revolt. Konstantin was known to eschew court etiquette and to take frequent stands against the wishes of his brother Alexander I, for which he is remembered fondly in Russia, but in his capacity as the governor of Poland he is remembered as a hated ruler.  Early life  Konstantin was born in Tsarskoye Selo on 27 April 1779, the second son of the Tsesarevich Paul Petrovich and his wife Maria Fyodorovna, daughter of Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Of all Paul's children, Konstantin most closely resembled his father both physically and mentally. His paternal grandmother Catherine the Great named him after Constantine the Great, the founder of the Eastern Roman Empire. A medal with antique figures was struck to commemorate his birth; it bears the inscription \\"Back to Byzantium\\" which clearly alludes to Catherine's Greek Plan. According to the British ambassador James Harris, Grand Duke Konstantin of Russia, son of Emperor Paul Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld aka Anna Fedorovna The direction of the boy's upbringing was entirely in the hands of his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views to the men who were in her confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov was supposed to be the actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress's grandsons. Catherine arranged Konstantin's marriage as she had Alexander's; Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, 14, and Konstantin, 16, were married on 26 February 1796. As Caroline Bauer recorded in her memoirs, \\"The brutal Constantine treated his consort like a slave. So far did he forget all good manners and decency that, in the presence of his rough officers, he made demands on her, as his property, which will hardly bear being hinted of.\\" Due to his violent treatment and suffering health problems as a result, Juliane separated from Konstantin in 1799; she eventually settled in Switzerland. An attempt by Konstantin in 1814 to convince her to return broke down in the face of her firm opposition.  Napoleonic Wars  Portrait of Konstantin at the Battle of Novi, a Russian victory During this time, Konstantin's first campaign took place under the leadership of Suvorov. The battle of Bassignana was lost by Konstantin's fault; but at Novi he distinguished himself by personal bravery, so that the emperor Paul bestowed on him the title of tsesarevich, which according to the fundamental law of the constitution belonged only to the heir to the throne. Though it cannot be proved that this action of the tsar denoted any far-reaching plan, it yet shows that Paul already distrusted the grand-duke Alexander. Konstantin never tried to secure the throne. After his father's death in 1801, he led a disorderly bachelor life. He abstained from politics, but remained faithful to his military inclinations, without manifesting anything more than a preference for the externalities of the service. In command of the Imperial Guards during the campaign of 1805, he had a share of the responsibility for the Russian defeat at the battle of Austerlitz; while in 1807 neither his skill nor his fortune in war showed any improvement. After the peace of Tilsit he became an ardent admirer of Napoleon and an upholder of the Russo-French alliance. He therefore lost the confidence of his brother Alexander; to the latter, the French alliance was merely a means to an end. This view was not held by Konstantin; even in 1812, after the fall of Moscow, he pressed for a speedy conclusion of peace with Napoleon, and, like field marshal Kutuzov, he too opposed the policy which carried the war across the Russian frontier to victorious conclusion upon French soil. His personal behaviour towards both his own men and French prisoners was eccentric and cruel. During the campaign, Barclay de Tolly was twice obliged to send him away from the army due to his disorderly conduct. His share in the battles in Germany and France was insignificant. At Dresden, on 26 August, his military knowledge failed him at the decisive moment, but at La F√®re-Champenoise he distinguished himself by personal bravery. In Paris the grand duke excited public ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads. His first visit was to the stables, and it was said that he had been marching and drilling even in his private rooms.  Governor of the Kingdom of Poland  Konstantin's importance in political history dates from when his brother, Tsar Alexander, installed him in Congress Poland as de facto viceroy (however, he was not the \\"official viceroy\\", namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland), with a task of the militarization and discipline of Poland. In Congress Poland, he received the post of commander- in-chief of the forces of the kingdom to which was added in 1819 the command of the Lithuanian troops and of those of the Russian provinces that had belonged to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (so called Western Krai). Alexander's policies were liberal by the standards of Restoration Europe. Classical liberals lapped up the freedoms of education, scholarship and economic development, but key deficiencies in Poland's autonomy like lack of control over the budget, military, and trade left them hungry for more.Lukowski, p. 124 The Kalisz Opposition, led by the brothers Bonawentura and Wincenty Niemojowski, pressed for reforms including more independence for the judiciary. Alexander, calling their actions an \\"abuse\\" of liberty, suspended the Polish parliament (Sejm) for five years and authorised Konstantin to maintain order in the kingdom by any means necessary.Lukowski, p. 125 Joanna Grudzi≈Ñska Into thar scene of unrest entered Konstantin, attempting to execute his brother's mandate to silence dissent. His efforts to strengthen the secret police (Ochrana) and to suppress the Polish patriotic movements led to popular discontent among his subjects. Konstantin also harassed the liberal opposition, replaced Poles with Russians on important posts in local administration and the army and often insulted and assaulted his subordinates, which led to conflicts in the officer corps. The Sejm, until then mostly dominated by supporters of the personal union with Russia, saw his actions as disobedience of the very constitution of which he felt personally proud. That also led to him being mocked, which he did not help by sending his adjutants with threats to those \\"guilty\\" of it like Wirydianna Fiszerowa. Nevertheless, Konstantin was an ardent supporter of Polish musicians, such as Maria Agata Szymanowska and Fr√©d√©ric Chopin. After 19 years of separation, the marriage of Konstantin and Juliane was formally annulled on 20 March 1820. Two months later, on 27 May, Konstantin married the Polish Countess Joanna Grudzi≈Ñska, who was given the title of Her Serenity Princess of Lowicz. Connected with that, he renounced any claim to the Russian succession, which was formally completed in 1822. After the marriage, he became increasingly attached to his new home of Poland.Lukowski, p.127  Succession crisis and Decembrist Uprising  Constantine ruble, a rare silver coin issued during the Russian interregnum of 1825 When Alexander I died on 1 December 1825, Grand Duke Nicholas had Konstantin proclaimed emperor in Saint Petersburg. In Warsaw meanwhile, Konstantin abdicated the throne. When that became public knowledge, the Northern Society scrambled in secret meetings to convince regimental leaders not to swear allegiance to Nicholas. The efforts would culminate in the Decembrist revolt. Under Nicholas I, Konstantin maintained his position in Poland. Differences soon arose between him and his brother because of the part taken by the Poles in the Decembrist conspiracy. Konstantin hindered the unveiling of the organized plotting for independence, which had been going on in Poland for many years, and held obstinately to the belief that the army and the bureaucracy were loyally devoted to the Russian Empire. The eastern policy of the Tsar and the Turkish War in 1828 to 1829 caused a fresh breach between them. The opposition of Konstantin made the Polish army take no part in the war.  Failed assassination and November uprising  An assassination attempt was made on the life of Grand Duke Konstantin, which precipitated the November 1830 insurrection in Warsaw (the November Uprising). After the attempt on Konstantin‚Äôs life, a secret court was set up to prosecute those who were responsible. \\"It was learned that Nicholas had ordered the Grand Duke Konstantin ... to start an energetic investigation and court-martial the culprits ... the committee at its session of 27 November decided irrevocably to start the revolution on the evening of the 29th, at 6pm.\\" Like the assassination, the recruitment of army units by the rebels failed; only two units joined them, and only the capture of the armory and the subsequent arming of the populace kept the revolt alive.Lukowski, p.132 Konstantin saw the revolt as a strictly Polish affair and refused to use troops, as he could have, because it was a foolish politically. He could trust his Russian troops, but to use them might be considered a violation of the kingdom‚Äôs independence and even an act of war. Because of that setback, he was limited to the resources around him. If he decided to intervene, it would require a different source of manpower. He was limited to the handful of Polish troops he could gather together. Constantin thus refused to send his troops against the revolutionaries: \\"The Poles have started this disturbance, and it's Poles that must stop it\\", and he left the suppression of the revolt in the hands of the Polish government. Polish Prince Ksawery Lubecki, realizing that the insurgents had formed no government by midnight, assembled some members of the council and other prominent personalities on his own initiative. They sent a delegation to the grand duke, but when he stated again that he did not wish to intervene in any way, the committees decided to take matters into their own hands. Konstantin‚Äôs involvement remained minimal, showing considerable restraint in not wanting to use Russian troops to help put down the rebellion. The timid response that he did give was that he would not attack the city of Warsaw without giving it 48 hours' notice, that he would intercede between the emperor and the Polish Kingdom, and that not order any Lithuanian troops into Poland. What the he was trying to accomplish was to remain neutral at all costs, which led to a belief among his fellow Russians that he was more sensitive towards the Polish independence than to Russian dominance. The securing of neutrality from Konstantin gave the Polish government the feeling that Russia would not attack Poland and gave it the chance effectively to quash the uprising. It was then able to effectively defeat the radicals in the country. After securing neutrality from Konstantin, he retreated behind Russian lines to watch how the scenario would play out. That further confused the Polish government on the matter of what its status was with Russia because of a previous promise by the Russians to help put down the rebellion. The patriotic Poles could not have been more pleased took the upper hand. Konstantin, on 3 December, retreated toward Russia. He retreated behind Russian lines, but following the failure of the uprising expressed admiration for the valor of the Polish insurgents. The policy of neutrality at all costs has led to Konstantin being viewed two ways through the scope of history. Either he would be viewed by the Russian royal family as weak and sympathetic to the Poles, or he would be seen as a seed for the idea of a soon to be independent Poland, but he was effectively only trying to avoid a wider war.  Death and legacy  Konstantin died of cholera in Vitebsk (now in Belarus) on 27 June 1831 and did not live to see the suppression of the revolution. His frequent stands against the wishes of the Imperial Family were perceived in Russia as brave, even gallant. In Poland, he was viewed as a tyrant, hated by the military and civilian population alike, and in Polish literature, Konstantin is portrayed as a cruel despot.

The Museum houses works dating from prehistory to the present day in its Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Jewish Art and Life Wings, and features extensive holdings of biblical and Land of Israel archaeology. Since its establishment in 1965, the Museum has built up a collection of nearly 500,000 objects, representing a broad sample of world material culture. On October 25, 2017, Prof. Ido Bruno was appointed Director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as the Anne and Jerome Fisher Director. Bruno served as a professor in the Industrial Design Department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts & Design, Jerusalem. He brings to the position decades of experience as a curator and designer of exhibitions presented in Israel and across the world with a focus on art, archeology, science, and history. He was unanimously elected by the Museum's Board of Directors, chaired by Isaac Molho, following an extensive search and review process of candidates from Israel and abroad. Bruno assumed his position at the Museum in November 2017. James S. Snyder, former Deputy Director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was appointed director of the museum in 1997. From 1965, the museum was housed in a series of masonry buildings designed by the Russian-born Israeli architect Alfred Mansfeld. A $100-million campaign to renovate the museum and double its gallery space was completed by Israeli architects Efrat-Kowalsky Architects who renovated the existing buildings in July 2010. The wings for archaeology, the fine arts, and Jewish art and life were completely rebuilt and the original buildings were linked through a new entrance pavilion. The passageways that connect between the buildings and five new pavilions were designed by James Carpenter.Transparency Is Only the Beginning, New York Times Heliodorus Stele The museum covers nearly 50,000 sq. meters and attracts 800,000 visitors a year, including 100,000 children who visit and attend classes in its Youth Wing. Archaeology Wing The Samuel and Saidye Bronfman Archaeology Wing tells the story of the ancient Land of Israel, home to peoples of different cultures and faiths, using unique examples from the Museum's collection of Holy Land archaeology, the foremost holding in the world. Organized chronologically, from prehistory through the Ottoman Empire, the transformed wing presents seven ‚Äúchapters‚Äù of this archaeological narrative, weaving together momentous historical events, cultural achievements, and technological advances, while providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of the peoples of the region. This narrative is supplemented by thematic groupings highlighting aspects of ancient Israeli archaeology that are unique to the region's history, among them Hebrew writing, glass, and coins. Treasures from neighboring cultures that have had a decisive impact on the Land of Israel ‚Äì such as Egypt, the Near East, Greece and Italy, and the Islamic world ‚Äì are on view in adjacent and connecting galleries. A special gallery at the entrance to the wing showcases new findings and other temporary exhibition displays. Elaborate wooden burial coffin, housed in the Israel Museum Highlights on view include: Pilate Stone, \\"House of David‚Äù inscription (9th century BCE), A comparative display of two shrines (8th‚Äì7th century BCE), The Heliodorus Stele (178 BCE), Royal Herodian bathhouse (1st century BCE), Hadrian‚Äôs Triumph: Inscription from a triumphal arch (136 CE), the Mosaic of Rehob (3rd century CE) and Gold-glass bases from the Roman Catacombs (4th century CE), the Ossuary of Jesus son of Joseph. Shrine of the Book Shrine of the Book The Shrine of the Book houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest biblical manuscripts in the world, as well as rare early medieval biblical manuscripts. The scrolls were discovered in 1947‚Äì56 in 11 caves in and around the Wadi Qumran. An elaborate planning process of seven years led to the building's eventual construction in 1965 which was funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, a Hungarian √©migr√©, the philanthropist who had purchased the scrolls as a gift to the State of Israel. The building consists of a white dome over a building located two-thirds below the ground. The dome is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. The colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness, whereas the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness. The interior of the shrine was designed to depict the environment in which the scrolls were found. There is also a permanent display on life in the Qumran, where the scrolls were written. The entire structure was designed to resemble a pot in which the scrolls were found. The shrine was designed by Armand Bartos and Frederick Kiesler, and was opened in 1965. As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3‚Äì6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it \\"rests\\" from exposure. The museum also holds other rare ancient manuscripts and displays the Aleppo Codex, which is from the 10th-century and is believed to be the oldest Bible codex in Hebrew. Second Temple model Second Temple model at Israel Museum Adjacent to the Shrine is the Model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, which reconstructs the topography and architectural character of the city as it was prior to its destruction by the Romans in 66 CE, and provides historical context to the Shrine's presentation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Originally constructed on the grounds of Jerusalem's Holyland Hotel, the model, which includes a replica of Herod's Temple, is now a permanent feature of the museum's campus. Fine Arts Wing The Edmond and Lily Safra Fine Arts Wing reflects the wide-ranging, interdisciplinary nature of the Museum's collections, encompassing works of art from across the ages in Western and non-Western cultures. The wing has been reorganized to highlight connections among works from its diverse curatorial collections, which include: European Art; Modern Art; Contemporary Art; Israeli Art; the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; Asian Art; Photography; Design and Architecture; and Prints and Drawings. Installations are organized to underscore visual affinities and shared themes and to inspire new insight into the arts of different times and places, as well as an appreciation of the common threads of human culture. The reconfigured wing includes the Museum's first permanent galleries for Israeli art; more than doubled gallery space for the Museum's extensive collections in modern art; providing meaningful connecting points between Western and non- Western holdings; and a full 2,200-square-meter (7,200-square-foot) gallery floor devoted to changing displays from the Museum's collection of contemporary art. Highlights newly on view include: The Noel and Harriette Levine Photography Collection, The Jacques Lipchitz Collection, Gustave Courbet, Jura Landscape with Shepherd and Donkey (ca. 1866), Alberto Giacometti, Alfred Barye, Diego in the Studio (1952), Ohad Meromi, The Boy from South Tel Aviv (2001).  European, Modern, and Israeli art  The Death of Adonis, ca. 1614 by Peter Paul Rubens The Israel Museum holds a large collection of paintings representing a wide range of periods, styles, subjects, and regions of origin. Painters in the collection include such international figures as Rembrandt and Camille Pissarro as well as such Israeli and Jewish artists as Marc Chagall, Abel Pann, and Reuven Rubin. The Israel Museum's commitment to Israeli art is central to the Museum's mission. As Israel's national museum, it plays a major role in preserving Israel's artistic heritage by collecting works by Israeli artists - in Israel and abroad - and by encouraging Israel's artists to develop in their careers. The Museum's Israeli Art collection spans the late 19th century through today, and it reflects the evolution of Israel's cultural history in the visual arts. The Information Center for Israeli Art provides scholars and the public with comprehensive archival information on several thousand Israeli artists, including biographical notes, press materials, videos, photographs, and other forms of documentation. Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life The holdings of the \\"Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life\\" represent the religious and secular material culture of Jewish communities worldwide, spanning centuries from the Middle Ages to the present day. The collection reflects the depth and beauty of Jewish heritage and creativity as well as the aesthetic and stylistic influences of other cultures in places where Jews lived. The origins of the collection can be traced to the early twentieth century with the establishment of the Bezalel National Museum under the directorship of Mordechai Narkiss, who expanded significantly the collection of ritual art objects through important treasures rescued between the two world wars and after the Holocaust. Later on, this treasure was integrated in the newly established Israel Museum in 1965 into the departments of Jewish Art and of Jewish Ethnography. In 1995 they were united into a new independent wing. Over the years the Wing's holdings have been strengthened through gifts and acquisitions of individual objects; gift of private collections; and fieldwork within communities in Israel and abroad. The Wing's prominent collections are the Stieglitz Collection and the Feuchtwanger Collection for Jewish ritual objects, Torah scroll ornaments, and life cycle objects, as well as the Schulmann Collection and Rathjens Collection for North African and Yemenite material culture, dress, jewelry and ritual objects. The wing's collection contains many unique treasures, among them, are rare manuscripts, four reconstructed synagogue interiors, a wide variety of ceremonial and ritual objects, as well as diverse material culture including dress, jewelry, and everyday artifacts. In the new permanent display, important objects drawn from this extensive collection from the public and the private realm, are integrated into a multifaceted narrative. This comparative display explores the objects‚Äô history and the social context in which they were used while underscoring their aesthetic qualities and emotional resonance. It reflects a vivid cultural tapestry weaving together the individual and the communal, the sacred and the mundane, the heritage of the past and the creative innovations of the present. Five principal themes unfold as you walk through the galleries: *The Rhythm of Life: Birth, Marriage, Death - highlighting the coexistence of joy and sadness, life, and death, memory and hope at each of these junctures in the life cycle. *Illuminating the Script - a display from our collection of rare medieval and Renaissance Hebrew manuscripts, shedding light on their history and revealing their artistry. *The Synagogue Route: Holiness and Beauty - Four restored interiors of synagogues from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, along with Torah scroll ornaments, show the unity and diversity of Jewish religious architecture and ritual objects. *The Cycle of the Jewish Year - The sanctity of the Sabbath and the traditional celebration of religious holidays, as well as the new commemoration of special days in the State of Israel, have given rise to a wealth of finely crafted objects and imaginative artworks. *Costume and Jewelry: A Matter of Identity- Environment, custom, and religious law all play their role in creating the rich variety of Jewish dress and jewelry from East and West presented here.\\"Dress Codes: Revealing the Jewish Wardrobe\\" , An exhibition focusing on this collection was presented at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem March 11, 2014-October 18, 2014 Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life The Information Center has a research library and a unique archival collection, constantly growing, of some twenty thousand photographs. Many of them are extremely rare, documenting the daily life of Jewish communities around the world, some no longer exist, including images of synagogues, cemeteries, ceremonial objects and many other subjects. The information center offers access to resources of the collections as well as virtual tours in former exhibitions in order to broaden and deepen knowledge behind the objects in the Wing's collections.

The Art Garden, designed for the original campus by Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, is counted among the finest outdoor sculpture settings of the 20th century. An Oriental landscape combined with an ancient Jerusalem hillside, the garden serves as the backdrop for the Israel Museum's display of the evolution of the modern western sculptural tradition. On view are works by modern masters including Jacques Lipchitz, Henry Moore, Claes Oldenburg, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Rodin, and David Smith, together with more recent site- specific commissions by such artists as Magdalena Abakanowicz, Mark Dion, James Turrell, and Micha Ullman. Youth Wing The Ruth Youth Wing for Art Education was opened in 1966. It is unique in its size and scope of activities, presents a wide range of programming to more than 100,000 schoolchildren each year, and features exhibition galleries, art studios, classrooms, a library of illustrated children's books, and a recycling room. Special programs foster intercultural understanding between Arab and Jewish students and reach out to the wide spectrum of Israel's communities. The wing combines annual original artworks of Israeli and international artists, with educational activities. There are also a variety of workshops for children and adults. Rockefeller Archaeological Museum and the Ticho House In addition to the extensive programming offered on its main campus, the Israel Museum also operates two off-site locations: the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum that opened in 1938 for the display of artifacts unearthed mainly in the excavations conducted in Mandatory Palestine, in the 1920s and 1930s; and Ticho House, which offers an ongoing program of exhibitions by younger Israeli artists in a historic house and garden setting.

The sabre was in widespread use in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth during the Early Modern period, especially by light cavalry during 17th century. The sabre became widespread in Europe following the Thirty Years' War and was also adopted by infantry. In particular, it served as one of the symbols of the nobility and aristocracy (szlachta), who considered it to be one of the most important pieces of men's traditional attire.  Types = Hungarian-Polish szabla  The first type of szabla, the Hungarian-Polish (wƒôgiersko-polska), was popularized among the szlachta during the reign of the Transylvanian-Hungarian King of Poland Stefan Batory in the late 16th century. It featured a large, open hilt with a cross- shaped guard formed from quillons and upper and lower langets and a heavy blade. The single edged blade was either straight or only slightly curved. Since the saber provided little to no hand protection, a chain was attached from the cross-guard to the pommel.Marsden (2015) Since a number of such weapons were made by order of the king himself during his reform of the army and were engraved with his portrait, this kind of sabre is also referred to as bator√≥wka ‚Äì after Batory's name.  Armenian-style szabla  In the late 17th century the first notable modification of the sabre appeared. Unlike the early \\"Hungarian-Polish\\" type, it featured a protected hilt and resembled the curved sabres of the East. It was hence called the Armenian sabre, possibly after Armenian merchants and master swordsmiths who formed a large part of arms makers of the Commonwealth at those times. In fact the Armenian sabre developed into three almost completely distinct types of swords, each used for a different purpose. Their popularity and efficiency made the Polish nobles abandon the broadswords used in Western Europe. *Czeczuga was a curved sabre with a small cross-guard with an ornamented open hilt and a hood offering partial protection to the hand. * Ordynka was a heavier weapon used by the cavalry. It resembled a mixture of all the features of the Czeczuga with a heavier and more durable hilt and blade of the short sword. * Armenian karabela was the first example of a ceremonial sword used by the szlachta. It had both its blade and cross-guard curved, and had a short grip. It was engraved and decorated with precious stones and ivory. Used throughout the ages, in the 18th century it evolved into a standard karabela, used both as a part of attire and in combat (see below).  Hussar szabla  Polish hussar sabre, 1614. The hussar sabre was perhaps the best-known type of szabla of its times and became a precursor to many other such European weapons. Introduced around 1630, it served as a Polish cavalry m√™l√©e weapon, mostly used by heavy cavalry, or Polish Hussars. Much less curved than its Armenian predecessors, it was ideal for horseback fighting and allowed for much faster and stronger strikes. The heavier, almost fully closed hilt offered both good protection of the hand and much better control over the sabre during a skirmish. Two feather-shaped pieces of metal on both sides of the blade called moustache (wƒÖsy) offered greater durability of the weapon by strengthening its weakest point: the joint between the blade and the hilt. The soldier fighting with such sabre could use it with his thumb extended along the back-strap of the grip for even greater control when 'fencing' either on foot or with other experienced horsemen, or by using the thumb-ring, a small ring of steel or brass at the junction of the grip and the cross-guard through which the thumb is placed, could give forceful downward swinging cuts from the shoulder and elbow with a 'locked' wrist against infantry and less experienced horsemen. This thumb ring also facilitated faster 'recovery' of the weapon for the next cut. A typical hussar szabla was relatively long, with the average blade of in total. The tip of the blade, usually some 15 to 18 centimetres long, was in most cases double-edged. Such sabres were extremely durable yet stable, and were used in combat well into the 19th century. The Polish and Hungarian szabla's design influenced a number of other designs in other parts of Europe and led to the introduction of the sabre in Western Europe. An example that bears a considerable resemblance is the famous British 1796 pattern Light Cavalry Sabre which was designed by Captain John Gaspard le Marchant after his visits \\"East\\" to Central and Eastern Europe and research into these and other nations' cavalry tactics and weapons. Poland had ceased to exist as a separate nation by this time but their other co-nation from previous centuries, Hungary, was still an existing nation, and as this was the source of all things \\"Hussar\\", it was the Polish-Hungarian szable of 150 years earlier rather than the oft quoted Indian tulwar that were the main source of inspiration for the first \\"mainly cutting\\" sabre in the British Army. This same \\"1796\\" sabre was taken up by the King's Hanoverian troops and also by the Prussians under General Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher who attempted to give his name to the weapon, almost universally known as \\"the 1796 Light Cavalry Sabre\\" in the rest of Europe. This weapon also found its way into the cavalry of the newly formed United States in the War of 1812.  Karabela  Eagle's-head-shaped hilt of a karabela The karabela entered service around 1670. A karabela was a type of szabla popular in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the 1670s. The word \\"karabela\\" does not have well-established etymology, and different versions are suggested.\\"Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© polonaise de linguistique\\", vol. 58, p. , For example, Zygmunt Gloger suggests derivation from the name of the Iraqi city of Karbala, known for trade of this kind of sabres.Zygmunt Gloger, \\"Ksiƒôga rzeczy polskich\\" 1896, p. 148  Other types  * Kosciuszkowska, a variant popularized during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising; * Szabla wz.34 (\\"model 34 szabla\\"), a 20th-century variant produced from 1934 in the Second Polish Republic for Polish cavalry; just about 40,000 were made.  Technique = Stance  There are many stances for the Szabla, such as Back-Weighted, Toes Forward, Even-Weighted, and Forward-Weighted. Back-Weighted is a stance in which the back leg is bent, and put the weight onto. While the front leg is free to move with little weight in the case of an attack by the opponent. Toes Forward is a stance in which weight is evenly distributed between each leg. The balls of the feet are planted on the ground while the toes are raised. Even-Weighted is a stance in between Forward-weighted and Back-weighted. Forward-Weighted is a stance in which most of the weight is on the front leg, allowing the back leg to move freely. This allows the person to lean into or away from the attacker.  Footwear  Proper footwear was also very important when it comes to stance. There are two main types of footwear used in Poland at the time, Polish Hussar Boots and Turkish footwear. Polish Hussar Boots were used in the 17th century. They came in mostly yellow, gold, or maize coloring. They had a high heel and also allows for the ball of the foot to rest naturally on the ground. Despite the name, Turkish footwear was common in 17th century Poland. Like the Polish Hussar Boots, these boots had a high heel for attaching spurs, as well as allowing the ball of the foot to rest on the ground. See also *Shashka References * W.

History Entrance to the Shrine of the Book Initially, it was intended to build a home for the scrolls on the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University, adjoining the Jewish National and University Library. The building was constructed in 1965, funded by the family of David Samuel Gottesman, a Hungarian-Jewish philanthropist.Israel's Treasure Trove, Jerusalem Post The building was designed by Armand Phillip Bartos, Frederick John Kiesler and Gezer Heller over a period of seven years.[http://www.archdaily.com/156442/AD Classics: Shrine of the Book / Armand Phillip Bartos and Frederick John Kiesler The shrine is built as a white dome, covering a structure placed two- thirds below the ground, that is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black basalt wall. According to one interpretation, the colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness; the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3‚Äì6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it \\"rests\\" from exposure. The shrine houses the Isaiah scroll, dating from the second century BCE, the most intact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Aleppo Codex, dating from the 10th century CE, the oldest existing Hebrew Bible.[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/A-sound-in-silence A Sound in Silence, Jerusalem Post A facsimile of the original Isaiah scroll is now on display in the Shrine of the Book.

Though tickers punched the bell codes into their tapes, printers generally do not print a character when the bell code is received. Bell codes are usually represented by the label \\"\`BEL\`\\". They have been used since 1870 (initially in Baudot code). To maintain backward compatibility, video display terminals (VDTs) that replaced teletypewriters included speakers or buzzers to perform the same function, as did the personal computers that followed. Modern terminal emulators often integrate the warnings to the desktop environment (e.g., the macOS Terminal will play the system warning sound) and also often offer a silent visual bell feature that flashes the terminal window briefly.  Representations  In ASCII and Unicode the character with the value 7 is BEL. It can be referred to as control-G or in caret notation. Unicode also includes a character for the visual representation of the bell code, \\"symbol for bell\\" (‚êá) at \`U+2407\`, not to mention \`U+237E\` (‚çæ). In the 5-bit Baudot codes, BEL is represented by the number 11 (\`0x0B\`) when in \\"figures\\" mode. In the C programming language (created in 1972), the bell character can be placed in a string or character constant with \`\\\\a\`. ('a' stands for \\"alert\\" or \\"audible\\" and was chosen because \`\\\\b\` was already used for the backspace character.)  Usage  Keyboard for the Osborne 1 On Unix-like systems, or on MS-DOS or Windows, a user can cause the equivalent of ringing the bell to happen by typing at the command prompt the command: echo ^G where the is produced by holding down and typing . On Unix the user may need to type + first to \\"quote\\" the . On Linux or Mac OS X one may also use: echo -e \\"\\\\a\\" and in the Bash shell, one may use ANSI-C quoting:ANSI-C quoting echo $'\\\\a' An alternative is to use the tput command, which as a part of the ncurses library is available on most Unix/Linux operating systems: tput bel A program can get the same result by printing the BEL character to a terminal. On modern systems this may not make a noise; it may instead make a visual indication such as flashing the screen, or do nothing at all.

It was signed on 10 February 1828 in Torkamanchay, Iran. The treaty made Persia ceded to Russia the control of several areas in the South Caucasus: the Erivan Khanate, the Nakhchivan Khanate and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. The boundary between Russian and Persia was set at the Aras River. The territories are now Armenia, the south of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Nakhchivan and Iƒüdƒ±r Province (now part of Turkey). The treaty was signed for Persia by Crown Prince Abbas Mirza and Allah-Yar Khan Asaf al-Daula, chancellor to Shah Fath Ali (of the Qajar Dynasty), and for Russia by General Ivan Paskievich. Like the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan, the treaty was imposed by Russia, after a military victory over Persia. Paskievich threatened to occupy Tehran in five days unless the treaty was signed.Zirisnky, M. ‚ÄúReza Shah‚Äôs abrogation of capitulation, 1927-1928‚Äù in The Making of Modern Iran: State and Society Under Riza Shah 1921-1941.

For Iran this was a time of weakness, humiliation and soul-searching as Iranians sought to assert their dignity against overwhelming pressure from the expansionist west\\". By this final treaty of 1828 and the 1813 treaty, Russia had finished conquering all the Caucasus territories from Qajar Iran what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, all of which had formed part of its very concept for centuries. The area north of the Aras River, such as the territory of the contemporary nations of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the North Caucasian Republic of Dagestan, were Iranian until they were occupied by Russia during the 19th century. As a further result and consequence of the two treaties, the formerly-Iranian territories became part of Russia for around the next 180 years except Dagestan, which has remained a Russian possession ever since. Out of most of the territory, three separate nations would be formed through the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991: Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.

The museum is under the management of the Israel Museum and houses the head office of the Israel Antiquities Authority.The Rockefeller Museum, Haaretz History Prior to the establishment of the Rockefeller Museum, the British Mandate Department of Antiquities and British School of Archaeology were housed in an old building in Jerusalem with a small exhibition hall. The only other archaeological museum at the time was the Franciscan Biblical Museum, built in 1902.Rockefeller Museum: Historic Background In 1906, the Jewish National Fund began to negotiate the purchase of Karm el-Sheikh, a tract of land facing the northeastern corner of the Old City walls, to house the Bezalel School of Art and Crafts. The founder of the school, Boris Schatz envisaged a museum and university that would overlook the Temple Mount.West Meets East: The Story of Rockefeller Museum In 1919, town planner Patrick Geddes proposed the establishment of an antiquities museum at this site. To further the project, the Mandate authorities proposed a special tourism tax in 1924. Visiting Mandatory Palestine in 1925, during the days of the British Mandate, James Henry Breasted, founder and director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, recognized the need for an archaeological museum in Jerusalem to house important regional finds.Israel Antiquities Authority: Rockefeller Museum Encouraged by Lord Plumer, the British High Commissioner, Breasted approached American philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who agreed to donate two million dollars toward the project. Previously, he had offered to build an archeological museum in Cairo, Egypt, but he was turned down, possibly due to pressure from the British government, which was anxious to keep America from establishing a foothold in the region. Relief representing Israelite culture, one of ten bas-reliefs by Eric Gill in the inner courtyard at the museum. The museum was designed by Austen Harrison, (Austen St. Barbe Harrison), chief architect of the Mandatory Department of Public Works, who drew up blueprints for a white limestone building integrating eastern and western architectural elements. The cornerstone of the new museum was laid on June 19, 1930, but construction was delayed due to the discovery of tombs dating to the fifth century B.C. at the building site. The museum features a stone bas-relief of the meeting of Asia and Africa above the main entrance together with ten stone reliefs illustrating different cultures and a gargoyle fountain in the inner courtyard carved in 1934 by the British sculptor Eric Gill (1882‚Äì1940). Gill also produced stone carved signage throughout the museum in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. Rockefeller Museum inner courtyard. Inner courtyard with a view to the tower. The museum opened to the public on January 13, 1938. Officially, it was called the Palestine Archaeological Museum, but was also known as the Rockefeller Museum. Until the final days of the Mandate period, the museum was administered by the British Palestine Government. On 1 April 1948 it was closed for the public. On 20 April 1948, the High Commissioner appointed a council of international trustees to administer the museum. The council consisted of twelve members: two representing the High Commissioner, one from the British Academy, one from the British Museum, one from the French National Academy, one from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two from the Antiquities Departments of the Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Transjordanian governments; one from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, one from the Royal Swedish Academy, one from the American Institute of Archaeology, and one from the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem.Rockefeller Museum, Israel Antiquities Authority The board run the museum until 1966. In the 1950s controversies came up about objects removed by the two sides to Amman and the Israeli side respectively. After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the museum also became a secondary headquarters of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, headed by Gerald Lankester Harding until 1956. In 1966, the museum was nationalized by King Hussein during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank. Seven months later, when the 1967 Six-Day War broke out, the museum was captured by an Israeli paratroop brigade. Its hexagonal tower was used as a lookout. Fierce fighting took place here between Israeli and Jordanian forces, culminating in an Israeli victory. The Museum was then officially renamed as the Rockefeller Museum. Since 1967, the museum has been jointly managed by the Israel Museum and the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (later reorganized as the Israel Antiquities Authority). Inside what was to have been the rear courtyard of the museum stood (until it died after nearly 300 years in 1998) one of the oldest pine trees in the country. According to Arab legend, on the site of this pine tree, Ezra the Scribe sat and wrote the Torah for Israel. The stump may still be seen behind the museum. Collections The museum's first curator was John H. Iliffe, who arranged the artifacts in chronological order, from two million years ago to 1700 AD. Among the museum's prized possessions are 8th-century wooden panels from the al-Aqsa Mosque and 12th-century (Crusader-period) marble lintels from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Most of the collection consists of finds from the 1920s and 1930s.In Jerusalem, a Museum's Treasures Go Unseen On display are artifacts unearthed in Jerusalem, Megiddo, Ashkelon, Lachish, Samaria, and Jericho. One of the Lachish letters is on permanent display at the museum,Lakhish Ostraca, c. 587 BCE as are the statuary and stucco decorations from the Umayyad Hisham's Palace. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at Qumran between 1947 and 1956, consisting of Jewish texts and commentaries, were housed in the Rockefeller Museum. In 1967, following the Israeli capture of East Jerusalem, for preservation, scrolls were relocated to the Shrine of the Book, a specially designed building on the grounds of the Israel Museum, with the ownership of these scrolls having been heavily contested ever since. The Copper Scroll was taken to the Jordan Archaeological Museum in Amman.On the Curious Protests of the Dead Sea Scrolls Exhibition in Toronto Exhibitions The museum regularly hosts special exhibitions, such as the 2019/20 exhibition of Armenian ceramics in Jerusalem.

He earned a degree in law at the Central University of Madrid, and then in 1933 entered the diplomatic School in Madrid. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War he volunteered to join the Nationalist side of the struggle, serving as a truck driver in the Cuerpo de Ej√©rcito Marroqu√≠, a unit of Francisco Franco's army created in 1937 and commanded by General Juan Yag√ºe. Diplomatic career Memorial, Zaragoza, Spain √Ångel Sanz Briz memorial in Madrid. In this house lived the ambassador of Spain, √Ångel Sanz Briz, who saved thousands of human beings from the Holocaust in Budapest in 1944. After completing his studies in Madrid, his first diplomatic posting was to Cairo. He was sent to Budapest in 1942 where he was the first secretary of the Spanish legation. Between June and December 1944, he and his assistants issued fake Spanish papers to 5,200 Jews, saving them from deportation to concentration camps. he initially received authorization to provide papers to 200 Jews, and continued to enlarge this amount until he reached 5,200.Rescue Story: Sanz-Briz, Angel, at yadvashem.org Accessed 5 January 2017 In some cases, he acquired houses in Budapest at his own cost in order to provide shelter for the refugees, which made the difference between life and death for those Jews. He convinced the Hungarian authorities that Spain, under the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera had given Spanish citizenship to descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Primo de Rivera had issued such a decree on December 20, 1924 but it had been canceled in 1930, a fact the Hungarian authorities were not aware of. Sanz Briz dutifully informed the Spanish Foreign Ministry of his actions, which were neither forbidden nor encouraged by Madrid. In 1944, as the Red Army approached Budapest, he followed government orders to leave for Switzerland. He was replaced by the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, who pretended to be a Spanish consul and continued to issue Spanish visas and to patrol the safehouse system for Jews set up by Sanz Briz. After these events, Sanz Briz continued his diplomatic career: he was posted to San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Ambassador to Lima, Bern, Bayonne, Guatemala, The Hague, Brussels and China (1973, where he became the first Spanish Ambassador). In 1976 he was sent to Rome as Ambassador of Spain to the Holy See, where he died on June 11, 1980. Sanz Briz himself tells how he was able to save the lives of so many Jews, in Federico Ysart's book Los jud√≠os en Espa√±a (1973). He is also the subject of the 2011 Spanish television series El √°ngel de Budapest, based on Diego Carcedo‚Äôs book Un espa√±ol frente al Holocausto (\\"A Spaniard against the Holocaust\\").

His company, George Newnes Ltd, continued publishing ground-breaking consumer magazines such as Nova long after his death. Background and education His father, Thomas Mold Newnes, was a Congregational church minister at the Glenorchy Chapel, Matlock. George Newnes was born in Matlock Bath, Derbyshire,Sir George at Biography.com accessed June 2007 and educated at Silcoates School and then at Shireland Hall, Warwickshire, and the City of London School. In 1875, he married Priscilla Hillyard. Career In 1867 he entered commerce in the \\"fancy goods\\" trade, working in London and Manchester. He began his career in publishing in 1881 when he founded Tit-Bits as a direct response to the Elementary Education Act 1870 which introduced education for children aged 5‚Äì12 and hence produced a new young generation able to read.\\"The 1870 Education Act\\". Parliament UK, Retrieved 21 Jan 2017. The magazine was initially published in Manchester like a mini-encyclopedia, containing extracts from books and other publications, but principally a diverse range of tit-bits of information presented in an easy-to-read format. He funded the magazine by opening a vegetarian restaurant in Manchester. (republished 2008) The addition of competitions increased the readership of the periodical, and in 1884 Newnes moved publication to London. He began to work with W. T. Stead, with whom he founded the Review of Reviews in 1890. Tit-Bits reached a circulation of 700,000 by the end of the 19th century. It paved the way for popular journalism ‚Äì most significantly, the Daily Mail was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, a contributor to Tit-Bits, and the Daily Express was launched by Arthur Pearson, who worked at Tit-Bits for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine. Arguably his best known publication was The Strand Magazine, begun in 1891, in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was first able to publish his Sherlock Holmes mystery series. He also founded other magazine titles, including The Westminster Gazette (1873), The Wide World Magazine (1888), and Country Life (1897). In 1891 his publishing business was formed into a company that bore his name, George Newnes Ltd. The company was reconstructed in 1897 with a capital of 1,000,000 pounds, and began the publication of books. In 1896 Newnes founded the book series, The Penny Library of Famous Books.Penny Library of Famous Books, oac.cdlib.org, Online Archive of California. Retrieved 30 December 2018. Politically, Newnes was Liberal, and he refounded the Westminster Gazette to support the party when the Pall Mall Gazette became a Unionist paper. In 1885 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the newly created constituency of Eastern Cambridgeshire or Newmarket. He held the seat for ten years, before his defeat by the Conservative millionaire horse-breeder, Harry McCalmont in 1895. In 1895 he was created a baronet \\"of Wildcroft, in the parish of Putney, in the county of London; of Hollerday Hill, in the parish of Lynton, and Hesketh House, in the borough of Torquay, both in the county of Devon.\\" He paid for the new Putney Library, built in 1899. Around this time he became the main sponsor of the Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica; ; part of his contribution was the purchase of a movie camera from Arthur S. Newman, who would later supply similar cameras to Herbert Ponting of Captain Scott's 1910-3 Terra Nova Expedition and John Baptist Lucius Noel, photographer on the 1924 Mount Everest expedition. He re-entered the Commons in 1900 as MP for Swansea, and held the seat until he retired at the January 1910 general election. Newnes built a large home called Hollerday House in Lynton, North Devon. It was destroyed by fire in 1913. He played a major part in the development of the twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth. He built an innovative cliff railway to join the two towns, and also provided the town hall and other amenities. Largely as a result of Sir George's efforts, the 19-mile Lynton and Barnstaple Railway opened in 1898 ostensibly to bring visitors from the mainline railways at Barnstaple. Newnes provided a silver cup for the Newnes Trophy series of chess matches between Great Britain and the United States, conducted over transatlantic cable from 1896 to 1911. Sir George Newnes died at his Lynton home in June 1910 aged 59, having suffered ill health from diabetes for some time. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, Frank Newnes, who had served as MP for Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire from 1906 to 1910. Publishing company Decades after the proprietor's death George Newnes Ltd continued into the 1960s as one of London's four leading magazine publishers ‚Äì along with Odhams Press Ltd, C. Arthur Pearson and the Hulton Press ‚Äì producing a diverse range of titles from Lady's Companion, Woman‚Äôs Own, Nova, Rave and Flair, to Practical Mechanics and Practical Television.

Her death led to an investigation which resulted in regulation of maternity clinics and adoptions in New York City in 1868. Early life Lattin was born in Farmingdale on Long Island. Around 1867, Lattin moved from Farmingdale to Williamsburg in Brooklyn, where she lived with her cousin Andrew Wood. Unplanned pregnancy Lattin became pregnant by George C. Houghton; he was a clerk at Whitehouse's boot and shoe store on Fulton Street, Brooklyn. He paid $50 to Dr. J.C. Harrison to perform an abortion, but Lattin did not go through with it. She was still hoping that Houghton would marry her. Houghton then quit his job and moved to Philadelphia, to escape the situation. Lattin next went to her cousin, George H. Powell who worked as a butcher at the Washington Market to help her. He pretended to be her husband and arranged for her, as \\"Mrs. Smith\\", to see Dr. Henry D. Grindle, who ran an unauthorized \\"lying-in\\" hospital that allowed pregnant woman to have their children and have them illegally adopted. The doctor wanted her to pay $150, but she could only pay $100 and he accepted it. Death Lattin checked into the lying-in hospital on August 5, 1868, then a few weeks later she delivered a healthy baby boy who was adopted anonymously without any record kept of the adoptive parents. Around August 18, 1868, she developed a postpartum infection. The medical student who attended to her realized Susannah was in serious condition and was not likely to survive, and he persuaded her to tell him her real name so he could notify her family. The message got to her parents after she had died. Coroner Aaron B. Rollins investigated the death. > From: 6 Amity Place, Manhattan. To: Mr. Henry Lattin.

The venture has held approximately 10% of the total market share since 2010, and as of 2017, was reckoned to be the largest automobile group worldwide. In 1996, Renault's CEO Louis Schweitzer hired Ghosn as his deputy and charged him with the task of turning the company around from near bankruptcy. Ghosn elaborated a plan to cut costs for the period 1998‚Äì2000, reducing the workforce, revising production processes, standardising vehicle parts and pushing the launch of new models. The company also undertook organisational changes, introducing a lean production system with delegate responsibilities inspired by Japanese systems (the \\"Renault Production Way\\"), reforming work methods and centralising research and development at its Technocentre to reduce vehicle conception costs while accelerating such conception.Donnelly, Tom; Donnelly, Tim; Morris, David. \\"Renault 1985‚Äì2000: From bankruptcy to profit\\".

Arrest in Tokyo and subsequent Nissan investigation=Initial arrest On 19 November 2018, Tokyo District Prosecutors arrested Ghosn at 4:30 p.m. upon his re-entry into Japan aboard a private jet that had come from Lebanon, for questioning over allegations of false accounting.Le Point. Du c√¥t√© des autorit√©s japonaises et fran√ßaises, un seul mot d'ordre: la stabilit√© de l'alliance' Renault‚ÄìNissan‚ÄìMitsubishi Motors\\". Le Point. 20 November 2018. Ghosn's top aide Greg Kelly, a Nissan director and former head of human resources, was also arrested upon his arrival from the U.S. that day. On the same day, Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa announced at a press conference that Ghosn had been dismissed from Nissan's board and would be stripped of executive rights at a meeting to be held on 22 November. Saikawa stressed that the dismissal was the result of an internal inquiry by Nissan, and alleged that Ghosn and Kelly had under-reported their compensation (a violation of securities law) and used company assets for personal use. While the allegations remained unproven in court, with due legal process pending, at the same news conference, Saikawa \\"expressed disappointment, indignation, and despair at Ghosn's conduct, which included using company funds for personal investments and misusing corporate assets\\" and also said, \\"This is an act that cannot be tolerated by the company... It is sufficient grounds for his dismissal.\\" Although the company did not provide details, reports in the Japanese media stated that Nissan was paying all or some of the costs at some amount of US$18 million for residences used by Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, and that Ghosn charged family vacation expenses to the company. The purchases of some of these residences and the payment of expenses were handled by a shell company named Zi-A Capital BV based in the Netherlands, which Kelly had instructed Nissan's board to set up to make venture investments at the end of 2010 (around the same time as Ghosn's divorce from his first wife and beginning of a relationship with his second wife). Nissan funds were used to purchase Ghosn's Paris apartment in 2005, and Zi-A funds were used to purchase his $5 million beachfront Rio apartment in 2012 and his Beirut mansion, which, with renovations, cost over $15 million. Nissan compliance auditors began trying to track Zi-A activity in 2014 but were stymied at first by the chain of shell companies used in Zi-A investments. In addition, to avoid reporting the full amount of his compensation in Nissan financials, as required by Japanese law beginning in 2010, Ghosn had Kelly structure complicated deferred payment plans which went unreported under an aggressive interpretation of the disclosure rules which Nissan's outside auditors had not signed off on, and which totaled around $80 million at the time of his arrest eight years later. According to Nikkei reports, Ghosn told investigators that he instructed Kelly to handle the compensation reporting in a legal manner, and Kelly told investigators that he acted on advice from outside law firms and the Financial Services Agency in handling the reporting. Leaks to the media said that Ghosn had planned to call a vote to fire Nissan CEO Saikawa and reinstate Kelly (who had semi-retired to the U.S. in 2015) to active service at the scheduled board meeting. Ghosn was detained at the Tokyo Detention House, under Japanese rules that allow suspects to be detained for up to 23 days without criminal charges being filed. Ghosn and Kelly were reportedly arrested on information provided by an unidentified non-Japanese executive in Nissan's legal department, in the second deal ever struck under Japan's recently introduced plea bargaining system. Charges were filed against Ghosn and Kelly on the underreporting of deferred compensation on 10 December, along with allegations of additional charges that restarted a 10-day holding period without bail. Nissan also took control of the Rio and Beirut properties and changed the locks, which has led Ghosn's family to sue for access. Continued detention and new charges On 21 December 2018, Ghosn was re-arrested on suspicion of shifting to Nissan personal losses of US$16.6 million related to a personal swap contract in October 2008 (during the global financial crisis). The introduction of those charges prevented Ghosn's release on bail later the same day, because the new charges permitted an additional 10‚Äì20 days of incarceration prior to a bail hearing. Subsequent reporting linked this charge to Ghosn's dealings with Sheikh Khaled al-Juffali, the vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia's largest conglomerates and majority owner of a company which owns half of a regional joint venture called Nissan Gulf, with the other half held by a wholly owned Nissan subsidiary. In return for a personal letter of credit from Juffali to Ghosn during the 2008 crisis, which served as bank-demanded collateral for Ghosn's swap contract, Nissan indirectly paid $14.7 million from an internal discretionary fund known as the \\"CEO Reserve\\" to a wholly owned Juffali company in four installments between 2009 and 2012, although the internal documentation did not specify the ultimate recipient. According to Tokyo prosecutors, Kelly was not involved in this transaction and so was released on bail on 25 December. Ghosn made his first public appearance after his arrest at an arraignment on Tuesday, 8 January 2019, where he asserted his innocence, making a statement in response to the main allegations against him; however, his bid to be released from prison on these charges was rejected. Ghosn's imprisonment was set to end on 11 January. That day, Ghosn was indicted on two additional charges: aggravated breach of trust and understating his income, once again extending his imprisonment. As a result, he could remain in jail for months more before a trial takes place. Two days later, Nissan's investigation allegedly found that, in addition to the underreporting of salary already charged, Ghosn had paid himself an undisclosed $8 million in 2018 from a Netherlands-based joint venture owned by Nissan and Mitsubishi that was set up in 2017, without the knowledge of either company's directors because Ghosn had the sole authority to dispense cash from the venture. Ghosn again appealed the denial of bail from 8 January and offered to meet greater restrictions and higher guarantees of appearance in return for his release, including wearing an ankle bracelet and posting his Nissan stock as collateral. Additionally, on 14 January Ghosn's wife Carole published a letter that she wrote to Human Rights Watch protesting against his treatment in detainment. Nevertheless, on 21 January, the Tokyo district court again denied bail. The Japanese term hitojichi shih≈ç (\\"hostage justice\\") has been brought up in some media reports.Carlos Ghosn autoris√© √† sortir de prison, trois mois apr√®s son arrestation ‚Äì Le Figaro Takashi Takano, one of Ghosn's lawyers stated that the Japanese judicial system is a country risk. Further developments On 11 January 2019 Jos√© Mu√±oz, Nissan's chief performance officer and head of its China operations, resigned from the company, effective immediately. Mu√±oz, considered to be a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor as CEO of Renault and Nissan, had been a \\"person of interest\\" in Nissan's internal investigation, with which he was reported to be uncooperative. One of Nissan's three independent directors opined that Nissan may simply eliminate the position of chairman and not replace Ghosn, a route previously taken by other scandal-plagued Japanese companies. The Reuters Japan news service reported that Nissan may file suit against Ghosn personally. At first the French government and Renault had been reported to be standing behind Ghosn during his imprisonment, on the presumption that Ghosn is innocent until proven guilty. However, France's financial minister Bruno Le Maire stated on 16 January that Renault may seek a new CEO to replace Ghosn due to his continued incarceration. Renault possibly worried about Nissan taking the chance to use the power vacuum at Renault to reshape the alliance's balance of power. \\"According to Japanese corporate law, Renault's voting rights [in Nissan] could be canceled if Nissan raises its shareholding to more than 25 percent in the French carmaker. Under French rules, if Renault lowered its stake in Nissan below 40 percent, then it will help the Japanese carmaker get voting rights in the French company.\\" After the French government called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected by the Japanese courts, Ghosn finally agreed to step down. He resigned as chairman and CEO of Renault on 24 January 2019. On 30 January, Ghosn said the charges were \\"plot and treason\\" by executives at Nissan who opposed the relationship with Renault and a future plan that was in the works to integrate Nissan, Mitsubishi and Renault. In mid-February, Ghosn's lead counsel Motonari Otsuru stepped down and was replaced by Jun'ichir≈ç Hironaka, who has a record of success in a number of high-profile cases. =Bail= In early March, Ghosn was granted a request for bail in a Tokyo court. This was his third bail request, and the first by his new legal team under Hironaka. The court set bail at 1 billion yen (about US$9 million) subject to stringent conditions. He was not allowed to travel abroad, and had to remain at a given address under 24-hour camera surveillance, with no internet access. He was released on 6 March 2019. On 3 April, Ghosn tweeted that he was \\"ready to tell the truth\\" and that he would hold a conference on 11 April. He was re-arrested for the fourth time early on 4 April over new suspicions of financial misconduct concerning alleged dealings via Oman. Ghosn released a statement claiming the arrest was \\"outrageous and arbitrary\\". Until that point in time he had been held for 108 days since he was first arrested in November 2018. On 8 April 2019, during an extraordinary shareholders meeting, Nissan shareholders voted to remove Carlos Ghosn from the company board. Shareholders also voted to remove Ghosn's former right-hand man Greg Kelly, and to appoint Renault chairman Jean-Dominique Senard as a director. The next day, Ghosn posted a YouTube video, where he publicly stated that he was \\"innocent of all the accusations that came around these charges that are all biased, taken out of context, twisted in a way to paint a personage of greed, and a personage of dictatorship\\". He also claimed that the payments to Juffali were meant to help Nissan fix a dispute with a local distributor, and to open a bank contract to convert his salary from yen to US dollars, in order to avoid currency swings. The Japanese court rejected an appeal filed by Ghosn's lawyers, and approved an initial 10 days detention for Ghosn, until 22 April. He was released in late April, but confined to strict house arrest, including having no contact with his wife for four months. =Investigations in other countries= In June 2019 Renault published that in an internal audit they had uncovered 11 million euros in questionable expenses by Ghosn, which was followed by the French state opening its own investigation into his actions. Prosecutors in the district of Nanterre west of Paris stated that anti-fraud police had searched his residence in the town of L'√âtang-la-Ville for evidence. In July Renault's headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt were searched by 20 police personnel in relation to this case. July also saw Carlos Ghosn take action against French mass-media for libel. In August his wife Carole appealed to President Emmanuel Macron of France to intercede on behalf of her husband with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe at the 45th G7 summit held from 24‚Äì26 August at the French town of Biarritz. In September, in one of the first legal accords of the saga, Ghosn settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims of failing to disclose more than $140 million in pay to him from Nissan. He was fined $1 million while Nissan was fined $15 million and Greg Kelly $100,000. Although he neither admitted nor denied the SEC's charges, he accepted a ten- year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Kelly accepted a five-year ban under similar terms. According to The New York Times, the settlement all but ended Ghosn's career as a global business executive. Flight from Japan On 30 December 2019, numerous media outlets reported that Ghosn had escaped from Japan and arrived in Beirut, Lebanon. Ghosn later confirmed these reports through a statement released by his press representative in New York. In his statement, Ghosn claimed that he would \\"no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant and basic human rights are denied.\\" Ghosn left his Tokyo apartment at around 14:30 on 29 December and joined two men at a nearby hotel.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-509640406 The three then took a bullet train from Shinagawa to Osaka and arrived at a hotel near Kansai International Airport just after 20:00. The team hired to extract him from Tokyo had noticed that Japanese security did not follow Ghosn into hotels, which facilitated his escape. A few hours later, two men left the hotel carrying large containers, including an audio equipment box where Ghosn was hidden. The men then boarded a Bombardier Global Express private jet with Turkish registration TC-TSR. The large box carrying Ghosn was never x-rayed or checked by customs officials, because it was too big to fit inside the x-ray machine; the plane left Kansai Airport at 23:10, landing at Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport at 5:26 on the morning of 30 December. Within an hour of the plane's landing, a separate private jet left for Beirut. An employee at Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet admitted to falsifying passenger records, in which two separate planes were leased, one from Dubai to Osaka and then Osaka to Istanbul, while the other from Istanbul to Beirut. On 8 May, Turkey charged seven people accused of helping Ghosn flee to Lebanon via Istanbul. Arrest warrants issued by Japanese prosecutors on 30 January 2020 claimed that the escape operation was orchestrated by former United States Army Special Forces soldier Michael Taylor, a private-security contractor with extensive contacts in Lebanon. The warrants also claimed that Michael was assisted by his son Peter Maxwell Taylor and a third American, George Antoine Zayek. Michael Taylor had conducted similar international rescue operations in the past and has also served time in prison in the United States. On 20 May, United States authorities arrested Michael and Peter Taylor on suspicion of helping Ghosn escape. Extradition of the two to Japan is sought. Residence in Lebanon Following Ghosn's arrival in Lebanon, a Tokyo court granted a request by Japanese prosecutors to revoke his bail. While Japan and Lebanon are both members of Interpol and have had diplomatic relations since 1954, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries. Interpol has issued a red notice for his arrest. Japanese authorities raided Ghosn's Tokyo apartment on 2 January looking for evidence. Separately, some Lebanese lawyers want Ghosn prosecuted over his 2008 trip to Israel as the chairman of Renault-Nissan to meet Better Place founder Shai Agassi, which they claim violated the Arab League boycott of Israel. Ghosn later addressed reports that his family, including his wife Carole, may have played a role in his departure from Japan, stating that \\"such speculation is inaccurate and false.\\" On 7 January, prosecutors in Japan issued an arrest warrant for Carole Ghosn on suspicion of giving false testimony during a court hearing in April 2019. Carlos Ghosn held his first press conference since leaving Japan on 8 January 2020, in which he described his imprisonment conditions, pleaded innocence and named Nissan executives who plotted his demise. He claimed that when he left Japan, \\"I fled injustice and political persecution. The next day, Judge Ghassan Ouiedat, a Lebanese prosecutor, imposed a travel ban on Ghosn. After his escape from Japan, Carlos Ghosn's Japanese lawyer and seven other members of his defense resigned. His lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said his escape was a \\"complete surprise\\". On 10 February, Ghosn hired former Disney president Michael Ovitz, co-founder of the Creative Artists Agency, as his Hollywood agent. On 12 February, Nissan launched a $90 million lawsuit against Ghosn for alleged ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù actions, and on 29 February, Japan's financial regulators fined Nissan 2.42 billion yen ($22 million) for underreporting remuneration of former Chairman Ghosn and other executives for years. On 8 July, The Nikkei reported that $862,500 was paid from a Paris bank account related to Ghosn to Promote Fox, a company managed by Peter Taylor, an ex-Green Beret who helped him flee to Lebanon. Ghosn's house in Lebanon sustained damage following the August 2020 Beirut explosion, which occurred 5 kilometers away from the residence. Personal life Ghosn's first marriage was to Rita Kordahi, who came originally from Rayfoun, Lebanon, and whom he met in France in 1984. Together they had four children: Caroline, Nadine, Maya and Anthony. They divorced in 2012. In May 2016, Ghosn married Lebanese-American Carole Nahas and, a few months later in October, threw a large-scale Marie Antoinette- themed party at the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles, in the outskirts of Paris, to celebrate both the wedding and Carole's 50th birthday. He is reported by several Japanese media to have six private residences: in Tokyo, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Amsterdam, Beirut and New York.Dumaine, Brian. \\"Renault‚ÄìNissan: Can anyone succeed Carlos Ghosn?\\".

During the reign of Jaya Bhim Dev Malla, he was sent on a project to build a golden stupa in Tibet, where he also initiated into monkhood. From Tibet he was sent further to North China to work in the court of the emperor Kublai Khan, the founder of Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368), where he brought the trans-Himalayan artistic tradition to China. In his later life, he renounced monkhood and started his family in China. He married seven other women from whom he had a total of six sons and eight daughters. Due to some confusion in translation, his name is variously written as Arniko or Araniko in old texts. A mistake made by Baburam Acharya ascribed his Sanskrit name as Balabahu. However, later he contends that Aniko might possibly be the Chinese pronunciation for Sanskrit name Aneka.Acharya, Baburam (1960). Aniko: His Family and Place of Birth. Regmi Research Series, vol 3, issue 11, pp. 241‚Äì243. Retrieved 31 Dec, 2012. It is also plausible that his name could mean Aa Ni Ka, meaning \\"respectable brother from Nepal\\". Early years Araniko was born in 1245 in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, when it was ruled by King Abhaya Malla (1216‚Äì55). While Nepalese history does not have any record of Arniko and everything that is known of him comes from Chinese accounts, Chinese history and historian Baburam Acharya opines that Araniko could possibly be from Patan, a place famous for sculptures and fine arts. As such, he would have been a Buddhist but his Newar caste is open to speculation. However, it is known that Araniko lived in Kathmandu Valley during the reign of Jaya Bhim Dev Malla, the successor of Abhaya Malla.Petech, Luciano (1984). Mediaeval History of Nepal (ca. 750‚Äì1480). 2nd ed. Serie orientale, toma 54. Rome: Institutio Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente. p.100 In the Chinese records, the name of his grandfather is given as \\"Mi-ti-rha\\" and grandmother as \\"Kun-di-la-qi-mei\\", Chinese pronunciation for Sanskrit names Mitra and Kundalaxmi respectively. His father's name was \\"La-ke-na\\" (Lakshman) while his mother's name was \\"Shu- ma-ke-tai\\". As is often told in stories about professional artists, Aniko was an artistic prodigy even in his early childhood. An anecdote from his epitaph relates that when he was three years old, his parents in took the child to a temple to pay homage to the Buddha. Looking up at a stupa, he asked \\"who made its wooden stambha, bhumis, anda?\\" Greatly surprised, the people around realized that he was a born artist. When he was about seven, his temperament was sober like an adult. At school, he mastered his textbooks and became a good calligrapher in such a short time that even the venerable elders acknowledged their inferiority. He could memorize treatises on art as soon as he heard them read. Before he left Nepal for Tibet, he was already an expert in painting, modeling, and casting images. Mission to Yuan-China Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa, one of the five founders of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, was appointed as a king of Tibet by the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (r. 1260‚Äì1294). Portrait of young Kublai Khan by Anige (1245‚Äì1306), a Nepali artist in Kublai's court Historical background The event that brought Arniko to Tibet, and eventually to the Yuan court in Shangdu (today's Beijing), was Kublai Khan's decree of 1260 CE to Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa, the fifth patriarch of Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, to build a golden stupa for Suer chi wa (Tibetan: \\"Chos rje pa\\" or \\"the Lord of Dharma\\"), that is the Sakya Pandita Kun dga' rgyal mtshan (1182‚Äì1251), the fourth patriarch of the sect. Kublai's order was one of the indicators of his acceptance of Sakya teaching. The timing of the construction, 1260, is worth noticing. In April 1260, Kublai was elected as the Great Khan by his own supporters, to rival the claim of his younger brother Ariq B√∂ke. Thus was launched a civil war between the brothers for the leadership of the Empire. In the twelfth month of 1260, he appointed Phagpa his Imperial preceptor and granted him a jade seal and the position of leader of Buddhism. By doing so Kublai officially acknowledged Phagpa as his highest religious authority and was obliged to patronize the Sakya teaching. In return, he expected the Sakya sect to provide religious sanction. The building of the stupa was not only a tribute to the Sakya Pandita but intended also as a project to win religious blessing in a critical year. Ariq B√∂ke finally submitted to Kublai at Shangdu on August 21, 1264. Lhasa To build the stupa, Phagpa drafted artisans from Nepal. The iconographies and artistic values of the Tibetans had a close affinity with those of the Nepali tradition. Therefore, it was natural for Phagpa to turn to Nepal for gifted artists. He intended to recruit one hundred artists, but Jaya Bhim Dev Malla, the king of Nepal at the time, was able to hand over only eighty. With his appointment as Imperial Preceptor in 1260, it must have been his vision and ambition for the future propagation of his sect throughout the still growing Mongol empire that he tried to scour for more artists. The artists bound for Tibet were ordered to choose a leader from among themselves. Perhaps due to the uncertainty of their future, nobody was courageous enough to take up the responsibility, except for the confident Arniko. When the king tried to discourage him because of his youth, he replied, \\"My body is indeed young, but my mind is not.\\" The king eventually made him the team leader of eighty artisans and sent him to Lhasa. He was only seventeen when he departed from Nepal. In Tibet, Arniko impressed Phagpa at their first meeting in 1261. Phagpa immediately recognized his exceptional artistic skill and administrative ability, and entrusted him to supervise the construction. The stupa was built within the Main Hall of the Sakya Monastery. Arniko spent two years on this project. After its completion, Phagpa was unwilling to let him leave when he asked for permission to return to Nepal. By this time, Kublai Khan had defeated Ariq B√∂ke, and both Kublai and Phagpa must have felt that the construction of the stupa in the Sakya monastery had gained religious merit that contributed to Kublai's military victory and other achievements. As Imperial Preceptor, Phagpa was ready to go to the court and disseminate his sect's teachings. Since no artist in China could make the bewildering array of Himalayan Tantric deities which would be indispensable for his religious activities, he needed to bring with him someone who could. Arniko was a natural choice. Instead of going back to Nepal, Phagpa encouraged him to go to the Mongol court to present himself to Kublai Khan. Phagpa accepted Arniko as his disciple and initiated him into secret Buddhist treaties, thus elevating his social status above an ordinary artisan. Thus having discovered Arniko, Phagpa personally prepared and trained Arniko for his future tasks at the court. Shangdu The White Stupa in present-day Beijing Portrait of Kublai Khan executed shortly after his death in February 1294 by Anige Portrait of Kublai Khan's wife Chabi by Anige Arniko arrived in Shangdu (Xanadu) by the end of 1262.

The Emperor was greatly pleased and asked young Araniko to repair an important bronze idol presented as a gift by a Song emperor. It took him two years to finish the restoration. In the second month of 1265, Arniko finished the restoration and the statue looked so perfect that even the most skilled artists of China greatly admired his work. In Yuan China, he designed and built many buildings. His most renowned architecture is the White Stupa of Miaoying Temple in Beijing, which was the largest structure at that time.Kesar Lall. A Nepalese Miscellany, p.32. Taking almost ten years (1279‚Äì1288 CE) to complete, the Stupa better known as White Dagoba, is still standing today. It rises to a height of 50.9 meters and has a diameter of over 30 meters at its base. Thirteen broad circular bands of molding, called the ‚ÄúThirteen Heavens,‚Äù divide its surface. At the apex of the cone is an umbrella-like bronze disc structure with 36 bronze bells hanging from its rim. At the very top is a small bronze pagoda, in itself a work of art. In 1961, then Chinese Premier Zhou En-lai signed a Proclamation stating that the Temple was to be protected as a National Treasure. This Proclamation kept the White Stupa safe during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. In 1976, the temple was seriously damaged by the Tangshan earthquake. The top of stupa tilted to one side, and the bricks and mortar supporting the stupa crumbled off, and many relics were broken. In 1978, the Beijing Department of Cultural Relics undertook the task of repairing and renovating the temple. As of 2010, the Stupa complex is currently undergoing another renovation.China Travel Guide: Miaoying Monastery and White Dagoba . Retrieved 9 Dec, 2011. It is summarized in his epitaph that during his lifetime, Arniko completed three stupas, nine great Buddhist temples, two Confucian shrines, one Daoist temple, and countless images and objects used in and out of the court. Arniko was also fine painter, and he executed a number of portraits of the imperial family. The portraits of Kublai Khan and his wife Chabi, now located in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, are believed to be his handiwork.Jing, Anning (1994). The Portraits of Khubilai Khan and Chabi by Anige (1245‚Äì1306), a Nepali Artist at the Yuan Court. Artibus Asiae, Vol. 54, No. 1/2 (1994), pp. 40‚Äì86. Arniko was accorded with high honors during his lifetime. He was named Director of All Artisan Classes in 1273 and trained many Chinese craftsmen in the Sakya style. Mongolia Culture Blog By 1274, he was given a silver plate to wear with an image of a tiger on it. The emperor became very fond of him and gave him the title \\"Duke of Liang\\" as an honor. Decorated with Ta Sa Thu, an equivalent of a minister, he is among the few foreigners whose biography can be found in Chinese imperial history books. The most important source of Arniko's life and career is his official epitaph written by Cheng Jufu (1249‚Äì1314) under Ayurbarwada's (Renzong, r. 1311‚Äì20) order of 1316, Liangguo Minhui gong shendao bei (The Spirit-way Stele for Minhui, the Duke of State of Liang), in Cheng Jufu, Cheng Xuelou wenji (The Collective Works of Cheng Jufu). Another important source is Arniko's official biography in Song Lian and Wang Yi, Yuanshi (The Yuan History), compiled under the supervision of the early Ming dynasty. It is largely based on the epitaph but contains some new information as well. Death Arniko remarried and settled in China. Apart from his Nepali wife, he had two Mongolian wives and seven Han-Chinese wives. Together they had six sons and eight daughters. He lived in China until his death in March 1306 at the age of sixty-two. Of his death Cheng Jufu writes: > On the eighth of March of 1306, he looked at the people around himself and > said, \\"If I am going, you should set up curtains in the hall and a couch, so > that I can pass away in peaceful sleep.\\" The next day, he took a bath and > went to court. After returning, he appeared ill. Palace envoys and doctors > visited, but he passed away in sleep on the eleventh. The emperor grieved > over his death after hearing the news and halted the court session. He > ordered palace officials to take care of the family, and reward the family > twenty-five thousand taels of silver. The Emperor ordered the authorities > concerned to make arrangements for the funeral. That night a star fell into > the courtyard. The next day saw icicles on the trees. Seven days after, on > the seventeenth of March, his remains were cremated according to Nepali > custom.

Legacy Arniko's imperial portraits represent the watershed between Song, Yuan and later imperial portraits. The aim of later portraits were no longer to suggest virtuous conduct, but physiognomy. This approach was followed not only in later Yuan imperial portraits but also in the Ming and Qing imperial portraits which became increasingly frontal and rigid, and eventually more and more realistic under the new influence of European portraiture. The history of Chinese Buddhist art witnessed three major waves of artistic influences from Central and South Asia: GandhƒÅra art before the Tang (618‚Äì907), Gupta art during the Tang, and PƒÅla-Himalayan art during the Yuan. Arniko is the figure representing the third wave. The artworks from his institutions, stupas, and the two Yuan portraits from his hand demonstrate that by drawing inspiration from the artistic traditions of PƒÅla, Nepal, and China. After the collapse of Mongol rule in China, Arniko's artistic legacy and innovation continued to influence Buddhist art at the Ming and Qing courts. The Nepalese government, in recognition of his achievements, had issued postal stamps in his name to honor himRajan's Postage Stamps of Nepal Page . Retrieved 8 Dec, 2011.

Lamjung, Nepal ‚Äì 1815 A.D.) was a Nepalese military commander and administrator in the Kingdom of Nepal. Initially, he served for the Kingdom of Lamjung. He is considered one of the national heroes of Nepal. Grand Old Man Bhakti Thapa was the Sardar (commander) of Lamjung state, so he fought against Gorkhali in the battle from the side of Kehari Narayan, the King of Lamjung. After the fall of Lamjung in the battle against the Gorkhali (Nepali) forces, he was captured and brought to Kathmandu as a prisoner of war. Later he was appointed as sirdar (one of the sirdars) in the Nepali army. Just two years after the unification of Jumla, he was made the supreme commander (Sardar) of the Nepalese army stationed to the west of the capital in a region that stretched almost up to the Sutlej river, and also the administrator of this region. Sardar Bhakti Thapa's great success in the unification of Jumla District made him a legendary figure. He was a patriot involved in the Anglo-Nepalese War. His most important contribution in the war was at the western front of Deothal. In the Anglo-Nepal war, Sardar Bhakti Thapa was controlling operation of the whole Western Region of Nepal from the fort of Malaun, whereas the fort of Surajgadh was in the south of this fort. As the British forces had control over the fort of Deuthal, away from Malaun fort, the whole of the Western Region was at stake, which made Sardar Bhakti Thapa go to the battlefield, taking naked Khukuri and sword on his hand, along with 2,000 Nepalese soldiers amidst the fierce gun-firing of the British army on April 16, 1815. There was fierce fighting between the two forces, killing 100 soldiers of the Nepalese army while all the officers were killed except only on arsenal. In this battle when Sardar Bhakti Thapa tried to capture a British cannon, he was hit by the bullet at his heart. The Major David Ochterlony, handed over very respectfully to the Nepalese army, the dead body of Sardar Bhakti Thapa after covering it with dosalla (a woollen shawl). The very next day, his body was cremated with the due state guard of honour. His two wives committed Sati (burning themselves on their husband's pyre). Before going to the battlefield, he had handed over his grandson to Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. Sitting at the foot of the flag of Nepal, Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa and Ram Das, the son of Sardar Bhakti Thapa, encouraged the Nepalese army looking around at the sight of war. The Anglo-Nepal war took a different turn after the end of this battle. The way Sardar Bhakti Thapa laid down his life at the Deothal battle has become a legend in Nepalese history. He belonged to Godar Thapa clan. Childhood legend Sardar Bhakti Thapa, a Lamichhane Thapa Chhetri According to recent historians, Bhakti Thapa was born in 1741. Bhakti Thapa's family lived in Dhangai, a remote village in Lamjung. Very little is known about the childhood life of Bhakti Thapa. There was, however, an unbelievable incident in the early life of Bhakti Thapa. That incident is virtually like a description from the children's story book. The full details of that incident had been passed down through the generations. Still many old people in Lamjung are seen telling that incident to their youngsters. That incident is described below. Bhakti Thapa was still a very young boy. One day he was sleeping on a big boulder not far away from his house in a remote village of Lamjung while his flocks of goats grazed the buckwheat field of the neighbour. The old neighbour woman stormed out of her house into the place where Bhakti Thapa was fast asleep in a rage cursing him for his misdeeds. What she saw at that time chilled her blood. Bhakti Thapa was sleeping on a big serpent coiled up on the boulder raising its wide hood high above casting shed that protected the young Bhakti Thapa against the scorching heat of the midday sun. The serpent slowly uncoiled without waking up the boy and descended from the boulder. It disappeared from the sight after slipping into the bushes nearby. The parents of the Bhakti Thapa were terribly distressed when they learnt about the whole incident. They thanked the God for saving the life of their beloved son. The old neighbour woman who saw the whole incident had a completely different opinion. She was convinced that Bhakti Thapa was no ordinary man. He possessed some sort of divine power. She was quick to realize that one day Bhakti Thapa would become a very famous person. The news of this incident quickly spread across the Lamjung and beyond. The big boulder near the native home of Bhakti Thapa in Lamjung is linked up twice with the events in his later life. After some years a grand ritual was performed to solemnize brotherhood relationship ( in Nepali metairi) between Bhakti Thapa and that big boulder. The third event that linked Bhakti Thapa with that big boulder near his native home was the last in his life. It is said that at that very moment during the Anglo-Nepal War when Bhakti Thapa fell in the Deothal Battle field on April 16, 1815, the big boulder near his native home also cracked with loud explosion. The cracked boulder is still lying there. Unification campaign of Nepal Bhakti Thapa joined the unification campaign in 1789 at a time when further advance of the Nepalese force to the west was completely blocked for more than two years by the then powerful kingdom of Jumla. It is said that Jumla had collected an army of twenty-two thousand men to face the Gorkhalis, a force far superior to anything the Gorkhalis could put in the field at that time In the first major military operation itself Bhakti Thapa had demonstrated his exceptionally brilliant skill in launching a very successful operation under the most adverse condition that was sure to astonish anyone. He changed the strategy of the predecessors and led an attack on Jumla from the difficult north route. The result was a swift victory and the lives of many people were also saved. Within a very short period of just two years, from 1789 to 1791, the western boundary of the Great Nepal had extended nearly as far as the Sutlez River (now India). Bhakti Thapa had played a crucial role in such rapid expansion of the Great Nepal. At that very time, Nepal was attacked by China from the north. During that period China was ruled by the powerful Emperor Chiang Lung of the Manchu Dynasty. Among the Manchu emperors, Kang Hu Shi and Chiang Lung are considered to be the most influential. Emperor Kang Hu Shi ruled China from 1661 to 1722. He was contemporary with the Louis XIV of France, Peter the Great of Russia and Aurangazeb of India. Similarly, Emperor Chiang Lung ruled from 1736 to 1796. During his reign, countries like Burna or Korea were under the influence of China. Administration in Western front The royal court sent the following orders to Bhakti Thapa regarding the abolition of slave trading in Garhwal: Nepal in great danger The Chinese invasion was directed straight towards Kathmandu. The main attack was centered on Kyrung, which is almost to the north of the Kathmandu valley. The Chinese attack was anticipated well in advance. As a result, Nepal had withdrawn most of its troops and commanders from the west to defend the capital Kathmandu against the Chinese invasion. It was the most critical period in the history of the newly born Great Nepal. The existence of Nepal was in great danger. The country was under the threat of falling apart. In many areas the rulers of the old regimes, who were disgruntled at the creation of the Great Nepal, had begun to stir up unrest. According to Sainikitihas of Nepal, Bhakti Thapa stationed in Kumaun virtually single-handedly succeeded in quelling the unrest fomented by the rulers of the old regime in the vast western regions which were very recently merged into the Great Nepal, despite the fact that he was made supreme commander and administrator of the territory stretching from Chepe-Marshyangdi to almost Sutlez River only in 1794. The Sainikitihas describes that Bhakti Thapa was constantly on the move from one end of this vast region to the other end, to prevent the Great Nepal from falling apart. Nepal and China realized that it would not be in the interest of either of the countries to prolong the war. A compromise solution was found to resolve the disputes that led to outbreak of the war. The fighting ended. According to L. Stiller there was no real winner. Immediately after the signing of peace treaty with China, Bhakti Thapa headquartered in Kumaun (now India) became the governor and chief commander of the whole region from the Chepe-Marshyangdi to almost the Sutlez River (in Pakistan). Britain's suspicion The process of expansion of the Great Nepal was rapid. It was natural for the British Government to be greatly alarmed. So British rulers might not have in reality any intention of helping Nepal. We can draw such a conclusion from the circumstances surrounding the visit of Captain Kirkpatrick to Kathmandu in 1793. The British governor general in India had agreed to send Kirkpatrick to mediate in Nepal- China dispute. Kirkpatrick did not even set out for Nepal until after the war had been successfully terminated by the Nepal-China agreement. The governor general was requested not to send Kirkpatrick since the war had been amicably concluded. Surprisingly the governor general was adamant on sending a man to Kathmandu. So Kirkpatrick visited Kathmandu for no specific official purpose. The intention of Kirkpatrick's visit could hardly be anything else but to watch closely Nepal's speedy preparation for the next phase of the unification campaign that had officially led to the emergence of Bhakti Thapa as its head. During the visit, Kirkpatrick found that Nepal was trying to reinvigorate the attack in the west. The circumstances, under which the visit of Kirkpatrick to Kathmandu took place, clearly show that the British rulers in India were all the time watching Nepal with great suspicion. At that time British rulers in India were adopting every possible method to enlarge the territory under their control. The way new territories were brought under the British control and ruled had provoked even the British public. The British Parliament had gone completely against it. Anglo-Nepal War Bhakti Thapa leading Gorkha men at Anglo Nepal war The process of expansion of the Great Nepal had spread rapidly across the Himalayan region. So it was natural for the British to be greatly alarmed. The Great Nepal was seen all along as a threat to British rule in India till the end of the Anglo- Nepal War of 1814-16. The British actively began preparation for the war from the time when F.R. Warren Hastings - Earl of Moira landed in India as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief in 1813. The actual declaration of war against Nepal is recorded as 1 November 1814, though the war began from the middle of October. The decision to declare war had been made six months earlier so the territorial dispute appears to be only a pretext. British forces had marched into Nepal across a frontier of more than to attack at several points at the same time. The eastern British flank was moving north from the Teesta area, whereas the farthermost western flank came from the Sutlej river area. It was virtually a modern-type warfare extended over a period of three calendar years and necessitating to protect the entire region bordering the enemy-held territory. The British invasion forces, in comparison with Nepalese, had absolute superiority in cavalry, pioneers, and at least the superiority of 10 times in infantry and 100 times in artillery. They also had the advantage of maneuverability in movement. In the early months of the war, the initial British invasion was completely beaten off. The British offensive ended in complete failure. Nepalese forces stationed within the shelter of the fortress were not only able to defend their position against an invading enemy many times superior in strength, but they even shocked them by their dreadful counteroffensive that used to be accompanied by big losses on the British side. The British rule in India was at risk of falling apart. Unfortunately at that time, the Sikhs and Marathas did not join Nepal in liberating the whole of the South Asian Continent from the grip of European domination. After the initial defeats, the British changed their strategy to avoid their casualties. They started to deploy long-range guns to level Nepal's fortifications. This strategy paid off. The British were able to advance quickly into the territory under Nepal's control. They even used elephants to carry heavy guns across the mountains. So the ability of the Nepalese force to defend the territory under their control was steadily declining. They were forced to pull back. There was a breakdown in the command and control system. Towards the middle of 1815, Amar Singh Thapa, chief of the Nepalese forces fighting in the western front, was confined within a small area of the Malaun fort. The fate of Nepal was going to be in the hands of the Governor General Lord Hastings, unashamedly imperialistic and who became famous for having established the British Empire in India more firmly than before. At that time he worked either to eliminate Nepal completely and bring it under British rule or to turn it into a vassal state like so many other states under that category in British India. He could be forced not to take any such decision detrimental to the honour of Nepal only if he perceived that such action could pose serious threat to the continuance of British rule in India. The Deothal Battle could not be anything else but a clear message of threat on behalf of Nepalese people to the British warning them not to take lightly the determination of Nepalese people to protect the honour of their country. Battle of Deothal Towards sunset on April 15, 1815, Bhakti Thapa and the army units under him arrived at the Malaun fort from their station at Surajgarh, without being noticed by the British army units scattered around the Malaun fortress. The following day in the morning, Bhakti Thapa, at the age of 74, led a daring counterattack against the British force entrenched at Deothal. Historians have presented the description of this battle at great length. It was 3.15 a.m. when a force of just about 400 under Bhakti Thapa marched out of the Malaun fort, to a slow but steady beat of a drum. The British column under Thompson had taken position at Deothal on reverse slopes. The cannons of 6-pounders were properly concealed. There were two Indian battalions, the Grenadiers companies of the Light Battalions and some 1,000 irregulars. The British strength was up to about 3,500 troops and weapons. Bhakti Thapa and his followers in the counterattack appeared to have vowed to fight to the death. Bhakti Thapa had even handed his infant grandson to the custody of the Amar Singh Thapa just before going to the battlefield. Bhakti Thapa laid down his life in the battlefield. Every one who fought from the Nepalese side was either killed or wounded. Reputation The British commanders were thoroughly shaken by the bravery of Bhakti Thapa in the Deothal Battle. Bhakti Thapa became a legend even in the eyes of British historians. One of the historians, CB Khanduri writes quoting various contemporary British historians: : \\"The euphemism of the BRAVEST OF THE BRAVES had been used by Napoleon for Marshal Ney, whose bravery during the retreat from Moscow in 1812 was one of the highest. BRAVE LES BRAVE, said Napoleon of him. The British then used this citation for the Gurkhas during and after the Anglo-Nepal War. Such was the bravery shown by Bhakti Thapa that the next legend of the Bravest of the Braves had been created on the day - 16 April 1815 at Deothal.\\" Badass of The Week website has written a tribute page for Sardar Bhakti Thapa.http://badassoftheweek.com/index.cgi?id=754350210833 Descendant Former SAARC Secretary General Arjun Bahadur Thapa is the eighth lineal descendant of Sardar Bhakti Thapa.

History 1977 Chevrolet Chevette 1973-1978 Honda Civic Econoboxes first came to prominence in the United States due to the 1973 oil crisis. Japanese automakers were leaders at producing smaller, fuel-efficient cars, as well as enjoying generally higher reliability and build quality than their US counterparts, so their offerings such as the Honda Civic generally outperformed their American competitors such as the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto. The best-known American econoboxes were the 1970s/80s Chevrolet Chevette, Ford Pinto, Ford Escort and the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon. Japanese econoboxes include the Honda Civic (in particular the first and second generations) and the Datsun B-210. Other cars such as the Chevrolet Sprint, Geo Metro, & Chevrolet Aveo as well as the Ford Festiva and Ford Aspire were considered econoboxes. Amongst the econoboxes were sold by American brands, many were manufactured in foreign countries. American car manufacturers in North America have typically had a hard time making money off of econoboxes, and they consider them \\"loss leaders\\" that only existed to meet CAFE fuel economy standards. So, over the course of time, American car companies shifted from manufacturing econoboxes themselves, and partnered with a foreign manufacturer to build them. An example of this is the American Ford Escort: the Escort replaced the Pinto in 1981, and was manufactured by Ford until 1990. The Escort built from 1991 to 1996 however was built using a Mazda \\"B\\" series. Chevrolet did the same thing using its \\"GEO\\" line, to sell cars built by Suzuki and Toyota. Chrysler did as well, using cars built by Mitsubishi. Today The term \\"econobox\\" is not often used for describing new cars, partly due to the boxy styling of economy cars declining at the end of the 1980s. Many long-running nameplates that obtained their start as econoboxes have since moved upscale. For example, the Austin Mini and VW Beetle have been revived as enthusiasts luxury cars, rather than cheap transportation for the masses. Meanwhile, the Toyota Corolla, Mazda 3 and the Honda Civic started as subcompact econoboxes but are now on the high-end of the compact size line.

These markets originated in Germany, but are now held in many other countries. The history of Christmas markets goes back to the Late Middle Ages in the German-speaking part of Europe, and in many parts of the former Holy Roman Empire that includes many eastern regions of France. Dresden's Striezelmarkt was first held in 1434 and is considered the first genuine Christmas market, as earlier markets were rather \\"December markets\\". Early mentions of these \\"December markets\\" can be found in Vienna (1298), Munich (1310), Bautzen (1384), and Frankfurt (1393). In many towns in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, Advent is usually ushered in with the opening of the Christmas market or \\"Weihnachtsmarkt\\". In southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria, it is called a \\"Christkind(e)l(s)(i)markt\\" (German language, literally meaning \\"Christ child market\\"). Traditionally held in the town square, the market has food, drink and seasonal items from open- air stalls accompanied by traditional singing and dancing. On opening night at the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, and in some other towns, onlookers welcome the \\"Christkind\\" (originally boy Jesus, but often depicted as an angel-like girl), acted out by a local child.  Attractions and stalls  Popular attractions at the markets include the Nativity Scene (a cr√®che or crib), Zwetschgenm√§nnle (figures made of decorated dried plums), Nussknacker (carved Nutcrackers), Gebrannte Mandeln (candied, toasted almonds), traditional Christmas cookies such as Lebkuchen and Magenbrot (both forms of soft gingerbread), Bratwurst, and for many visitors one of the highlights of the market: Gl√ºhwein, hot mulled wine (with or without a shot of brandy), or Eierpunsch (an egg-based warm alcoholic drink). Both help stave off the cold winter air which sometimes dips below freezing. More regional food specialties include Christstollen (Stollen), a sort of bread with candied fruit in Saxony, and hot Apfelwein and Frankfurter Bethm√§nnchen in Hesse.

Additionally, Berlin claims over 70 markets, which open in late November and close just after Christmas. Christmas markets are popular Christmas traditions in Austria, and are held in Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Linz, and Graz. The first \\"December Market\\" was held in Vienna in 1298. Vienna currently holds 20 different Christmas markets around the city. Most Christmas markets open in late November and last through December, closing right after 25 December, with a few staying open for New Year‚Äôs. The largest Christmas market and one of the most well known is the Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz near the Rathaus, Vienna‚Äôs historic city hall. The market draws 3 million people each year and includes 150 unique stalls that offer traditional Austrian foods, Christmas decorations and ornaments, handicrafts, and drinks. The Vienna Christmas World on Rathausplatz also features an advent theme park called the Adventzauber with workshops and cultural performances that cater to families and young children. Visitors to the Vienna Christmas World can also ice skate on a ice rink and through paths that run through the Rathausplatz Park. Other famous Christmas markets include the Christmas Market at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, the Art Advent on Karlsplatz, the Christmas Village at Belvedere Palace, and the Christmas Village on Maria-Theresien-Platz. The Christmas Market at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, ‚ÄúKultur-und-Weichnactsmarkt,‚Äù takes place in front of the imperial palace. It features Austrian handicrafts and goods as well as a cultural program with activities and workshops. The Art Advent on Karlsplatz offers artisan goods, a children‚Äôs program, and a petting zoo. Popular food specialities include Kinderpunsch (a non-alcoholic punch), Gl√ºhwein, Baumstriezel (a Hungarian pastry coated in cinnamon and sugar), Kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes), L√°ngos (savory deep fried dough), Schaumkuss (chocolate covered marshmallows), Stollen (bread with candied fruit), Maroni (roasted chestnuts), Bratkartoffel (roasted potato wedges), Lebkuchen (Austrian gingerbread), and baked potatoes.

Starting in 1997 Frankfurt Christmas Markets were established with support from Frankfurt in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds, and Manchester. Other large Christmas markets have been held in England in Bath (since 2000) and Liverpool (since 2006). The Christmas markets are such a success that they are becoming a major pull factor to increase trade and visitor numbers to towns and cities. Birmingham's Christmas Market, primarily located on New Street between the Bullring shopping centre and the Council House, is the \\"largest outdoor Christmas market in the UK\\" as well as the \\"largest authentic German Christmas market outside of Germany or Austria\\". The market also offers live entertainment on the main stage. The market is held for approximately six weeks every year and usually closes around 23 December. Manchester's Christmas Markets have also been successful with 300 stalls over eight city locations with each location being themed to create a different atmosphere such as French, World, and German, with European themed stalls on the Albert Square, Manchester proving to be the most popular.

There are 108 lakes in the vicinity. The Lauribina La pass at an elevation of is on its outskirts.  Religious significance  The Gosaikunda area has been delineated as a religious site. Hindu mythology attributes Gosaikunda as the abode of the Hindu deities Shiva and Gauri. The Hindu scriptures Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana and the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata refer to Samudra manthan, which is directly related to the origin of Gosaikunda. Its waters are considered holy and of particular significance during the Gangadashahara and the Janai Purnima festivals when thousands of pilgrims from Nepal and India visit the area. Gosaikunda is believed to have been created by Lord Shiva when he thrust his Trishul (holy Trident) into a mountain to extract water so that he could cool his stinging throat after he had swallowed poison. Tourism and trekking Gosaikunda is a significant place of interest on the Dhunche- Helambu trekking route. This trek adjoins the famous Langtang Valley trek in the same district. Both treks can be combined. Basic accommodation is quite easily available. Tea houses offer a variety of food and snacks. The trek to Gosaikunda starts in Dhunche Village or Syabru Besi in the Langtang Himal, or in Sundarijal in the Kathmandu Valley. When starting from Dhunche, the first day involves a long steady climb to reach Chandan Bari at an altitude of about . Laurebinayak at about can be reached on the second day. At this point, some trekkers choose to climb ahead to Gosaikunda, though altitude sickness is a concern as the ascent is rather steep. Many trekkers choose to stay at Laurebinayak, which also provides sunset and sunrise views of the Langtang and Ganesh Himal.

Ludwig Karl August von Hagemeister (; Leontij Andrianovic Gagemejster;Baltic, Alix. The Baltic Connection in Russian America. Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas, Neue Folge 42, No. 3 (1994), pp. 321-339. ) was a Russian naval officer who held the rank of Captain of the 1st rank in the Imperial Russian Navy. He was a maritime explorer of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean, and served briefly in 1817-1818 as the second Chief Manager of the Russian-American Company.  Career in the Navy  Hagemeister was born to an ethnic Baltic German family in the Russian Empire. He began his service in the Russian naval forces in 1795 as a volunteer midshipman. Along with a group of fellow junior servicemen, he joined the British Royal Navy in 1802 on board .Pierce, Richard A. Russian America: A Biographical Dictionary. Kingston, Canada: The Limestone Press. 1990, pp. 185-187. In 1806 he was directed to take with provisions needed to Russian America; this was the first of three circumnavigations in his career to New Archangel. Departing on 20 October 1806 from Kronstadt, Neva began to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the south, to go around the continent of Africa and sail East. After passing the Cape of Good Hope, Hagemeister and his subordinates were the first Russian crew to visit the Australian mainland, reaching the port of Port Jackson on 4 June. Reaching New Archangel (now Sitka, Alaska) on 13 September, Hagemeister was stationed on Kodiak Island for most of 1808. The Russian forces were at war with the Tlingit. He was ordered by Chief Manager of the Russian American Company (RAC), Aleksandr Baranov, to secure needed provisions from the Kingdom of Hawaii on 30 November 1808 and perhaps find a suitable location for a Russian colony there. Hagemeister explored portions of the North Pacific and met with King Kamehameha I in early 1809. Amicable conversations were commenced with the monarch and Hagemeister purchased a cargo of salt. Delivering the salt to New Archangel, he later departed for Saint Petersburg in 1810 on Neva. Hagemeister reached Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on 28 May and began the overland trek through Siberia. His circumnavigation was recognized by Russian authorities at St. Petersburg, as he was promoted to captain lieutenant and awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 4th class. He served as chairman of the Admiralty of Irkutsk from 1812 to 1815, in which capacity Hagemeister was responsible for building the first ships to cross Lake Baikal. Vasily Golovnin encouraged him to plan another journey to New Archangel, and worked for his appointment to an RAC ship. Besides delivering more needed provisions, Hagemeister was ordered to investigate Baranov's financial management of the company and deputed to replace him as Chief Manager if he felt it necessary. Baranov, then 70, had requested relief from his position for years in order to return to Russia.Borneman, Walter R. Alaska, Saga of a Bold Land. New York City: HarperCollins. 2003, p. 73. Commanding the Kutuzov, Hagemeister started his second circumnavigation in 1816. Hagemeister arrived at New Archangel during 1817, with his second-in-command, Semyon Yanovsky. Before examining Baranov's financial records, Hagemeister traveled to northern California to formalize relations with the Kashia Pomo people. He was the principal negotiator with leaders of the local Pomo band, and obtained the privilege to establish Fort Ross. The parties signed a treaty on 22 September 1817, with tribal officials reported to have said that \\"They are very pleased to see Russians occupy this land, for they now live in safety from other Indians who used to attack them from time to time. This security began only from the time of Russian settlement.\\"Spencer-Hancock, Diane, William E. Pritchard and Ina Kaliakin. \\"Notes to the 1817 Treaty between the Russian American Company and Kashaya Pomo Indians.\\" California History 59, No. 4 (1980/1981), pp 306-313. The agreement was made by RAC officials as a part of a scheme to take over Alta California from the Spanish Empire. Returning to New Archangel, Hagemeister and other naval officers spent the winter examining the financial records of the RAC. Sources disagree on what was found: Khlebnikov says that the records showed no evidence of malfeasance.Khlebnikov, K.T., 1973, Baranov, Chief Manager of the Russian Colonies in America, Kingston: The Limestone Press, Borneman says that they found a discrepancy in the amount of supplies listed in accounting records. On 11 January 1818 Baranov was, \\"in a most arrogant way\\", removed by Hagemeister from office. Hagemeister took over, changing the methods of payment to the promyslenniki workers, by giving currency for salaries and abandoning the share system in favor of provisions. He worked to improve relations with the Hawaiian Kingdom, as they had been damaged from the Sch√§ffer affair. Hagemeister outlawed trade by non-RAC Europeans, a policy later adopted by the Russian government.Black, Lydia T. Russians in Alaska, 1732-1867. Fairbanks, AK: University of Alaska Press. 2004, p. 197. This policy was contained in the Ukase of 1821, a decree from the Imperial Government that extended Russian land claims to northern California and banned all non-Russian European merchants from the area. Hagemeister appointed his direct second-in-command, Semyon Ivanovich Yanovsky, as the next Chief Manager. In late October 1818, Hagemeister and Baranov departed from New Archangel; the latter was pleased to be at last returning to Russia. But Baranov died in 1819, while they were still at sea, and was buried at sea. In 1820 Yanovsky was replaced by another naval officer, chosen directly by the Board of the RAC. In 1828‚Äì1829, Hagemeister made his final circumnavigation on the ship Krotky. During this journey, he surveyed the Menshikov Atoll (Kwajalein) in the Marshall Islands, plotting it on the map and specifying the location of some other islands. His diaries are composed in several European languages, including German, Russian, French, Portuguese, English and Spanish.

It is 286 km, almost due east, from Perth, the capital of WA. It is the major settlement in the Shire of Narembeen, in which the major industries are growing cereal crops and raising cattle and sheep. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. Narembeen means place of female emus in the local Aboriginal language. History The area was initially surveyed in 1836 by the Surveyor General John Septimus Roe. After camping on a rocky outcrop and seeing a group of emus he named the area Emu Hill. By the 1850s European settlers arrived in the area looking for pastoral land for wheat and grazing. Sandalwood cutters also frequented the area during this time. In 1901 the rabbit proof fence was constructed just to the East of Narembeen and can still be seen today. A settler named Charles Smith bought a property he called Narimbeen. By the 1900s more farmers moved to the area as land was opened upand by 1918 the town-site of Emu Hill was gazetted. In 1920, the town-site of Narembeen only existed as a minor railway siding to the railway line that had only just been built to Emu Hill. By the 1920s Emu Hill was the largest community in the region but the local populace opposed the building of a hotel in the town. As a result of this a Perth lawyer, Henry Dale and a Publican, Paddy Conlon, purchased of land at the railway siding of Narembeen to build a hotel. The town of Narembeen was established in 1922 about 5 km from the Emu Hill town- site. The location of Narembeen was not the best choice as it is prone to flooding. In 1924, there were rumours that gold had been discovered close to the rabbit proof fence and the town of Holleton was established about 50 km from Narembeen, but Narembeen prospered as it was the closest train station to Holleton and offered a motor transport service to the miners. Narembeen had a population of 2,100 by 1925 and Emu Hill was no more. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. In 1968 the town of Narembeen was officially declared.

Particle board is often confused with oriented strand board (also known as flakeboard, waferboard, or chipboard), a different type of fiberboard that uses machined wood flakes and offers more strength.  Characteristics  The cross section of a particle board Particle board is cheaper, denser and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost is more important than strength and appearance. Particleboard can be made more appealing by painting or the use of wood veneers on visible surfaces. Though it is denser than conventional wood, it is the lightest and weakest type of fiberboard, except for insulation board. Medium-density fibreboard and hardboard, also called high-density fiberboard, are stronger and denser than particleboard. Different grades of particleboard have different densities, with higher density connoting greater strength and greater resistance to failure of screw fasteners. A significant disadvantage of particleboard is its susceptibility to expansion and discoloration from moisture absorption, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer. Therefore, it is rarely used outdoors or in places where there are high levels of moisture, except in bathrooms, kitchens and laundries, where it is commonly used as an underlayment shielded beneath a moisture resistant continuous sheet of vinyl flooring. In dry environments, veneered particleboard is preferred over veneered plywood because of its stability, lower cost, and convenience.  History and development  Particleboard originated in Germany. It was first produced in 1887, when Hubbard made so-called \\"artificial wood\\" from wood flour and an adhesive based on albumin, which was consolidated under high temperature and pressure. Although the use of two or three layers of wood veneer is ancient, modern sheets of plywood with 5‚Äì11 core layers of veneer were invented in the early 20th century, and began to become common by the Second World War. During the war, phenolic resin was more readily accessible than top-grade wood veneer in Germany, and Luftwaffe pilot and inventor Max Himmelheber played a role in making the first sheets of particleboard, which were little more than pourings of floor sweepings, wood chips, and ground-up off-cuts and glue. The first commercial piece was produced during the Second World War at a factory in Bremen, Germany. For its production, waste material was used, such as planer shavings, off-cuts or sawdust, hammer-milled into chips and bound together with a phenolic resin. Hammer-milling involves smashing material into smaller and smaller pieces until they can pass through a screen. Most other early particleboard manufacturers used similar processes, though often with slightly different resins. It was found that better strength, appearance and resin economy could be achieved by using more uniform, manufactured chips. Producers began processing solid birch, beech, alder, pine and spruce into consistent chips and flakes; these finer layers were then placed on the outside of the board, with its core composed of coarser, cheaper chips. This type of board is known as three-layer particleboard. Jute-stick Particle board manufacturing process More recently, graded-density particleboard has also evolved. It contains particles that gradually become smaller as they get closer to the surface  Manufacturing  Particleboard or chipboard is manufactured by mixing particles or flakes of wood or jute-stick together with a resin and forming the mixture into a sheet. The raw material is fed into a disc chipper with between four and sixteen radially arranged blades. The chips from disk chippers are more uniform in shape and size than from other types of wood chippers. The particles are then dried, and any oversize or undersized particles are screened out. Resin is then sprayed as a fine mist onto the particles. Several types of resins are used. Amino-formaldehyde based resins are the best performing based on cost and ease of use. Urea melamine resins offer water resistance with more melamine offering higher resistance. It is typically used in external applications, with the coloured resin darkening the panel. To further enhance the panel properties, resorcinol resins can be mixed with phenolic resins, but that is more often used with marine plywood applications. Panel production involves other chemicals including wax, dyes, wetting agents and release agents, to aid processing or make the final product resistant to water, fire or insects. After the particles pass through a mist of resin sufficient to coat all surfaces, they are layered into a continuous carpet. This 'carpet' is then separated into discrete, rectangular 'blankets' which will be compacted in a cold press. A scale weighs the flakes, and they are distributed by rotating rakes. In graded-density particleboard, the flakes are spread by an air jet that throws finer particles further than coarse ones. Two such jets, reversed, allow the particles to build up from fine to coarse and back to fine. The formed sheets are cold-compressed to reduce thickness and make them easier to transport. Later, they are compressed again, under pressures between and temperatures between to set and harden the glue. The entire process is controlled to ensure the correct size, density and consistency of the board. The boards are then cooled, trimmed and sanded. They can then be sold as raw board or surface improved through the addition of a wood veneer or laminate surface.  Furniture design  Particle board has had a huge influence on furniture design. In the early 1950s, particle board kitchens started to come into use in furniture construction but, in many cases, it remained more expensive than solid wood. A particle board kitchen was only available to the very wealthy. Once the technology was more developed, particle board became cheaper. Some large companies base their strategies around providing furniture at a low price. To do this, they use the least expensive materials possible. In almost all cases, this means particle board or medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or similar. However, manufacturers, in order to maintain a reputation for quality at low cost, may use higher grades of particle board, e.g., higher density particle board, thicker particle board, or particle board using higher-quality resins. One may note the amount of sag in a shelf of a given width in order to draw the distinction. In general, the much lower cost of sheet goods (particle board, medium density fiberboard, and other engineered wood products) has helped to displace solid wood from many cabinetry applications.  Safety  Safety concerns exist for both manufacturing and use. Fine dust and chemicals are released when particleboard is machined (e.g., sawing or routing). Occupational exposure limits exist in many countries recognizing the hazard of wood dusts. Cutting particle board can release formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide in the case of amino resins, and phenol in the case of phenol-formaldehyde resins. The other safety concern is the slow release of formaldehyde over time. In 1984 concerns about the high indoor levels of formaldehyde in new manufactured homes led the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to set construction standards. Particleboard (PB), medium density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and laminated flooring have been major sources of formaldehyde emissions. In response to consumer and woodworker pressure on the industry, PB and MDF became available in \\"no added formaldehyde\\" (NAF) versions, but were not in common use . Many other building materials such as furniture finish, carpeting and caulking give off formaldehyde, as well as urea-formaldehyde foam insulation, which is banned in Canada for installation in a residential closed cavity wall. Formaldehyde is classified by the WHO as a known human carcinogen.

His name is variously written Kermur, Sire de Legalle, by Twiss, and Kermur and Kermuy, Sire de Legal, by others. In the List of Subscribers to Philidor's second edition it stands as in Twiss, but the spelling was, probably, in both cases Philidor's own. Along with other famous players, he played in Paris's Caf√© de la R√©gence, and is considered to have been possibly the strongest player in the world around the 1730s.D. Hooper and K. Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess 2nd Ed, Oxford University Press, 1992 He taught chess to Fran√ßois-Andr√© Philidor. The following portrayal of Legall is given in the London Magazine, May 1825, in an article titled \\"Chess and Chess Players by an ancient Amateur\\": > I am probably, without any exception, the oldest chess-player in Europe. I > have not only had the honour of contending \\"on the checquer'd field\\" with M. > Philidor, but I have frequently played at the Cafe de la Regence with M. de > Legalle, the master of that distinguished Professor, who, in my younger > days, was a better player than his celebrated pupil. There is no man of > whose person and deportment I retain a more vivid recollection than M. de > Legalle; he was a thin, pale old gentleman, who had sat in the same seat at > the Cafe, and worn the same green coat for a great number of years when I > first visited Paris. While he played at chess, he took snuffs in such > profusion that his chitterling frill was literally saturated with stray > particles of the powder, and he was, moreover, in the habit of enlivening > the company during the progress of the game, by a variety of remarks, which > every body admired for their brilliancy, and which struck me perhaps the > more forcibly, as I was at that time but indifferently acquainted with the > French tongue.London Magazine, May 1825 In the book The life of Philidor, the following considerations, which can give us an idea about de Legall's strength at the chessboard are reported: > M. de Kermur, Sire de Legal, at that time about forty years old, reigned > supreme in that famous Cafe, and was undoubtedly a player of extraordinary > strength; for Philidor alone was ever able to beat him, and that, too, not > until he had developed his entire force by playing with Sir Abraham Janssen > and the Syrian Stamma(*). The \\"first player of the band\\" found it necessary > to accept the Rook from M. de Legal; and it took full three years to work > his way up, through the various degrees of odds, to the honour of > confronting his master, on even terms, as a \\"first-rate\\". > (*) Fetis says that old chess-players at the Cafe de la Regence had repeated > to him Philidor's own statement, that he did not attain his full strength > until he had made his campaigns in Holland and in England. Thus, Legal was probably the strongest player of the Caf√© de la R√©gence and probably in the world until 1755 when he lost a match to Philidor. It is not known if he traveled or played in other countries besides France, but, since the Caf√© de la R√©gence, was the chess Mecca of the time, most of the strongest players of 18th century, sooner or later, ended up at the Caf√© and the strongest among them played Legal. It is known that he played with Sir Abraham Janssen, the strongest English player according to Philidor himself. G. Allen refers that Legal was of the same opinion of Philidor regarding the skills of Janssen over the board. This could indicate that, at even terms, Janssen won approximately only one fourth of the games played with Legal as he did with Philidor, but this is not completely clear from Allen's text if this interpretation is correct. The chess encounter between Legal and Janssen happened, according to aforementioned author, after the match between Philidor and Janssen and, thus, must be collocated after 1747. It is also very likely, as also suggested by Allen, that Legall played Stamma, since the latter lived for a certain period in Paris where he published the Essai sur le jeu des echecs in 1737. If this is correct, Legal would have played Stamma before Philidor began to attend the Caf√© de la R√©gence. Legal attained to a very advanced old age to nearly ninety years. After his defeat with Philidor in the match of 1755 and up to the time of his death, however, he maintained his rank as the second player of France. Thus, it is also highly probable that he played, with an overall favourable outcome, with the disciples of Philidor of the Soci√©t√© des Amateurs (Bernard, Carlier, Leger and Verdoni). Legall is the eponym of Legall's mate, a mating pattern found in his only extant game, Legall‚ÄìSaint Brie, Paris, 1750.

History  The Haifa Museum of Art was founded in 1951 in Haifa for a large exhibition of Marc Chagall. The museum was moved to it current stone building in Wadi Nisnas in 1977.  Building  The building was built in the late 1920s and was inaugurated in the early 1930s as an Anglican school for girls. After the establishment of the State of Israel, it served as an immigrant center and from the early 1950s it hosted the private high school called the \\"High School for the Children of Workers\\", which was run by a teachers' cooperative and belonged to the Workers Movememnt. At the end of the 1960s, a branch of the Histadrut \\"Mishlav\\" school, which was preparing adult students for matriculation exams, began operating in the afternoon. In 1978 the site was opened to the public as a municipal museum, after extensive renovation designed to prepare exhibition spaces and galleries.  Permanent collection  The permanent collection includes works of Joseph Zaritsky, Mordechai Ardon, Lea Nikel, Raffi Lavie, Moshe Gershuni, Michael Neeman, Pinchas Cohen Gan, Tzipi Geva, Yechiel Shemi, Yitzhak Danziger, David Adika, Igor Zeiger, Ranan Lurie, Marc Chagall, Honor√© Daumier, Odilon Redon, Chana Orloff and Andr√© Masson.

Also under the Museum's aegis are the Museum of Prehistory, the Israeli National Maritime Museum, the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art and latest addition is Hermann Struck Museum, opened in 2013.  Controversies = Ronald McDonald  Haifa Museum of Art came under scrutiny by exhibiting a statue depicting Ronald McDonald and called 'McJesus', reminiscenting of Jesus Christ on the Cross. The protests and calls for its removal were reported by Israeli and International media. The protests started with demonstration by Haifa's Arab Christian community, who tried to entered the museum and remove the sculpture. The museum was firebombed twice between 10 and 11 January while rioting local Christians threw stones at the police outside the museum and injured three officers.https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/193172-190114-finnish- artist-joins-calls-for-haifa-museum-to-remove-his-mcjesus- statuehttps://www.timesofisrael.com/mcjesus-artist-demands-haifa-museum- remove-artwork-because-he-supports- bds/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/15/sculpture-ronald-mcdonald- cross-ignites-violent-clashes-israel/  See also  * List of museums in Israel  References  External links  * Haifa Museum of art * The HFA Museums, in haifamuseums.org Museums in Haifa Art museums and galleries in Israel Museums established in 1951 1951 establishments in Israel ","title":"Haifa Museum of Art"},{"id":"1340754","text":"James Beeland Rogers Jr. (born October 19, 1942) is an American investor and financial commentator based in Singapore. Rogers is the Chairman of Beeland Interests, Inc. He was the co-founder of the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management. He was also the creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index (RICI). Rogers does not consider himself a member of any school of economic thought, but has acknowledged that his views best fit the label of the Austrian School of economics. Early life Rogers was born in Baltimore, Maryland and raised in Demopolis, Alabama. Education In 1964, Rogers graduated with a bachelor's degree cum Laude in History from Yale University. He got his first job on Wall Street, at Dominick & Dominick. In 1966, Rogers then acquired a second BA degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from the University of Oxford, as a member of Balliol College. In April 2019, he received the honorary Ph.D. from the Pusan National University with a recognition of his books in which his positive messages on Korean unification and the bright future are presented. Business career In 1964, Rogers joined Dominick & Dominick LLC on Wall Street, where he first learned about stocks and bonds. From 1966 to 1968, Rogers served as a draftee in the US Army for military service during the Vietnam War. In 1970, Rogers joined investment bank Arnhold and S. Bleichroder, where he worked with George Soros. In 1973, Soros and Rogers both left and founded the Quantum Fund. From 1970 to 1980, the portfolio gained 4200% while the S&P; advanced about 47%. The Quantum Fund was one of the first truly global funds. In 1980, Rogers decided to \\"retire\\", and spent some of his time traveling on a motorcycle around the world. Since then, he has been a guest professor of finance at the Columbia Business School. In 1989 and 1990, Rogers was the moderator of WCBS' The Dreyfus Roundtable and FNN's The Profit Motive with Jim Rogers. From 1990 to 1992, he traveled through China again, as well as around the world, on motorcycle, over 100,000 miles (160,000 km) across six continents, which was picked up in the Guinness Book of World Records. He tells of his adventures and worldwide investments in Investment Biker, a bestselling book. In 1998, Rogers founded the Rogers International Commodity Index. In 2007, the index and its three sub-indices were linked to exchange-traded notes under the banner ELEMENTS. The notes track the total return of the indices as an accessible way to invest in the index. Rogers is an outspoken advocate of agriculture investments. Between January 1, 1999, and January 5, 2002, Rogers did another Guinness World Record journey through 116 countries, covering 245,000 kilometers with his wife, Paige Parker, in a custom-made Mercedes. The trip began in Iceland, which was about to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of Leif Eriksson's first trip to America. On January 5, 2002, they were back in New York City and their home on Riverside Drive. He wrote Adventure Capitalist following this around- the-world adventure. It is currently one of his bestselling books. 2002 to present On his return in 2002, Rogers became a regular guest on Fox News' Cavuto on Business and other financial TV shows.Benjamin Scent, \\"Six more hard years tipped for subprime fallout\\" , The Standard, November 19, 2007. In 2005, Rogers wrote Hot Commodities: How Anyone Can Invest Profitably in the World's Best Market, in which Rogers quotes a Financial Analysts Journal academic paper co-authored by Yale School of Management professor, Geert Rouwenhorst, entitled Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures. In December 2007, Rogers sold his mansion in New York City for about 16 million USD and moved to Singapore. Rogers claimed that he moved because now is a ground-breaking time for investment potential in Asian markets. Rogers's daughters speak fluent Mandarin to prepare them for the future. He is quoted as saying: \\"If you were smart in 1807 you moved to London, if you were smart in 1907 you moved to New York City, and if you are smart in 2007 you move to Asia.\\"https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2010/03/08/jim-shrugged/ In a CNBC interview with Maria Bartiromo broadcast on May 5, 2008, Rogers said that people in China are extremely motivated and driven, and he wants to be in that type of environment, so his daughters are motivated and driven. He also stated that this is how America and Europe used to be. He chose not to move to Chinese cities like Hong Kong or Shanghai due to the high levels of pollution causing potential health problems for his family; hence, he chose Singapore. However, he remains skeptical of India's future, stating in 2001 that \\"India as we know it will not survive another 30 or 40 years\\".\\"India\\" . ‚Äì JimRogers.com; accessed June 11, 2017.

In September 2015, he left the Indian market saying \\"one can't just invest on hope\\". Financial advice In 2002, Rogers said that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's \\"reaction to the stock-market bubble has caused two more bubbles to grow: a real-estate bubble and a consumer-debt bubble.\\" In 2006, Rogers said he was shorting US financials, home builders and Fannie Mae. On November 4, 2010, speaking at Balliol College, Oxford, Rogers urged students to scrap career plans for Wall Street or the City, London's financial district, and to study agriculture and mining instead. \\"The power is shifting again from the financial centers to the producers of real goods.

It is a distilled spirit originating from the oil or raffia palm tree. Initially tapped in the form of palm sap, the spirit is consumed not only throughout Nigeria but across the entire West and Central African region (as well as in the diaspora). Since prior to colonial times, ‚Äòpalm wine tappers‚Äô have continued to refine their techniques converting the fermented palm sap into its more potent form, known as ‚Äòogogoro‚Äô, ‚Äòkaikai‚Äô, etc. Today, there is a misconception that Ogogoro can be ethanol, but traditionally, it had to come from the palm tree and then be distilled from this source. Terminology It is also known as akpeteshie (especially in Ghana), sapele water, kparaga, kai-kai, Sun gbalaja, egun inu igo meaning The Masquerade in the Bottle, push-me-push-you, and/or crim-kena, sons√© (\\"do you do it?\\" in Yoruba language). In the Igbo language it is known as '. Other Nigerian epithets include: ', ' Urhobo, as well OHMS (Our Home Made Stuff), Iced Water, Push Me, I Push You and Craze man in the bottle.Heap (2008) Calabar, ' Abeokuta, ' Ilesha, (white man is not smarter), , ' Pidgin English, Ijaw, and ' Bini and ',‚ÄúThose that are Cooking the Gins‚Äù, 599-600. Properties and preparation Ogogoro is distilled from the juice of Raffia palm trees. An incision is made in the trunk and a gourd placed outside it for collection, which is collected a day or two later. After extraction, the sap is boiled to form steam, which subsequently condenses and is collected for consumption. Ogogoro is not synthetic ethanol but it is tapped from a natural source and then distilled. As a direct result of colonial suppression of the once burgeoning industry, ogogoro - now referred to many as ‚Äòlocal gin‚Äô, has continued to be produced as a form of subsistence farming, catering only to local communities in rural environments. Outside of these settings and with an exception of very specific tribes, adulterated versions of ogogoro, watered down and mixed with harsher synthesised spirits, are infamously consumed by either the very poor, seeking a quick high, or those who consider themselves traditional enough to appreciate the medicinal/natural benefits of such a drink. Because of this, the once-reputable craftsman's spirit, has been priced out of the market, by cheaper alternatives ‚Äì notorious for hospitalising its imbibers, which in many cases, has resulted in headline-grabbing fatalities across the country. Social significance As drink and commodity, respectively, ogogoro carries substantial cultural and economic significance within Nigeria. It is an essential part of numerous religious and social ceremonies; Burutu (Ijaw) priests pour it onto the ground as offerings to contact their gods, while fathers of Nigerian brides use it as a libation by which they provide their official blessing to a wedding. The economic facets of ogogoro have been equally salient throughout recent Nigerian history. Many poor Nigerian families homebrew the drink as a means of economic subsistence, many of whom sell shots of it on city street corners. The criminalization of ogogoro which occurred under the colonial regime is also believed to have been largely economic; while the public justifications for the law regarded public health and Christian beliefs regarding alcohol, it has been argued that colonial officials were also seeking to suppress local economic activity which might draw money or labor away from the colonial system.  Future  Recently, some companies dedicated to introducing a premium and refined ogogoro into the market are springing up in Africa. These brands are spearheading a naturally distilled and original ogogoro without the negative cultural significances believed about ogogoro and its consumers in the past. They are rebranding ogogoro and introducing a sophisticated and well filtered ogogoro, which is becoming more marketable to both the old and the youth. One of these brands is Pedro's ogogoro Pedro's Ogogoro is a brand committed to selling real ogogoro tapped from its natural source in the Niger Deltan region of Nigeria.

Some 30% or less of initial drug candidates proceed through the entire multi-year process of drug development, concluding with an approved NDA, if successful. The goals of the NDA are to provide enough information to permit FDA reviewers to establish the complete history of the candidate drug. Among facts needed for the application are: * Patent and manufacturing information * Drug safety and specific effectiveness for its proposed use(s) when used as directed * Reports on the design, compliance, and conclusions of completed clinical trials by the Institutional Review Board * Drug susceptibility to abuse * Proposed labeling (package insert) and directions for use Exceptions to this process include voter driven initiatives for medical marijuana in certain states. Before trials To legally test the drug on human subjects in the U.S., the maker must first obtain an Investigational New Drug (IND) designation from FDA. This application is based on nonclinical data, typically from a combination of in vivo and in vitro laboratory safety studies, that shows the drug is safe enough to test in humans. Often the \\"new\\" drugs that are submitted for approval include new molecular entities or old medications that have been chemically modified to elicit differential pharmacological effects or reduced side effects. Clinical trials The legal requirement for approval is \\"substantial\\" evidence of effectiveness demonstrated through controlled clinical trials.Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Section 505; 21 USC 355] This standard lies at the heart of the regulatory program for drugs. Data for the submission must come from rigorous clinical trials. The trials are typically conducted in three phases: * Phase 1: The drug is tested in 20 to 100 healthy volunteers to determine its safety at low doses. About 70% of candidate drugs advance to Phase 2. * Phase 2: The drug is tested for both efficacy and safety in up to several hundred people with the targeted disease. Some two-thirds of candidate drugs fail in Phase 2 clinical trials due to the drug not being as effective as anticipated. * Phase 3: The drug is typically tested in several hundred to several thousand people with the targeted disease in double-blind, placebo controlled trials to demonstrate its specific efficacy. Under 30% of drug candidates succeed through Phase 3. * Phase 4: These are postmarketing surveillance trials in several thousand people taking the drug for its intended purpose to monitor efficacy and safety of the approved marketed drug. The legal requirements for safety and effectiveness have been interpreted as requiring scientific evidence that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks and that adequate instructions exist for use, since many drugs have adverse side effects. Many approved medications for serious illnesses (e.g., cancer) have severe and even life-threatening side effects. Even relatively safe and well understood OTC drugs such as aspirin can be dangerous if used incorrectly. The actual application The results of the testing program are codified in an FDA-approved public document that is called the product label, package insert or Full Prescribing Information.21 CFR 201.5: Labeling Requirements for Prescription Drugs and/or Insulin The prescribing information is widely available on the web, from the FDA, drug manufacturers, and frequently inserted into drug packages. The main purpose of a drug label is to provide healthcare providers with adequate information and directions for the safe use of the drug. The documentation required in an NDA is supposed to tell \\"the drug‚Äôs whole story, including what happened during the clinical tests, what the ingredients of the drug are, the results of the animal studies, how the drug behaves in the body, and how it is manufactured, processed and packaged.‚Äù Currently, the FDA decision process lacks transparency, however, efforts are underway to standardize the benefit-risk assessment of new medicines. Once approval of an NDA is obtained, the new drug can be legally marketed starting that day in the U.S. Of original NDAs submitted in 2009, 94 out of 131 (72%) were in eCTD format. Once the application is submitted, the FDA has 60 days to conduct a preliminary review, which assesses whether the NDA is \\"sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.\\" If the FDA finds the NDA insufficiently complete (reasons can vary from a simple administrative mistake in the application to a requirement to re-conduct testing), then the FDA rejects the application by sending the applicant a Refuse to File letter, which explains where the application failed to meet requirements. Assuming the FDA finds everything acceptable, they decide if the NDA needs a standard or accelerated review, and communicates acceptance of the application and their review choice in another communication, known as the 74-day letter. A Standard Review implies an FDA decision within about 10 months while a Priority Review should complete within 6 months. The decision comes in a Complete Response Letter.  Requirements for similar products  Biologics, such as vaccines and many recombinant proteins used in medical treatments are generally approved by FDA via a Biologic License Application (BLA), rather than an NDA. The manufacture of biologics is considered to differ fundamentally from that of less complex chemicals, requiring a somewhat different approval process. Generic drugs that have already been approved via an NDA submitted by another maker are approved via an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), which does not require all of the clinical trials normally required for a new drug in an NDA. Most biological drugs, including a majority of recombinant proteins are considered ineligible for an ANDA under current US law. However, a handful of biologic medicines, including biosynthetic insulin, growth hormone, glucagon, calcitonin, and hyaluronidase are grandfathered under governance of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act, because these products were already approved when legislation to regulate biotechnology medicines later passed as part of the Public Health Services Act. Medications intended for use in animals are submitted to a different center within FDA, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) in a New Animal Drug Application (NADA). These are also specifically evaluated for their use in food animals and their possible effect on the food from animals treated with the drug.

Felix Tikotin, an architect by profession, was an internationally renowned collector and dealer in Japanese works of art. For more than forty years he amassed his valuable and rare collection and organized exhibitions of Japanese art in many museums. During the Second World War, because he was Jewish, Felix Tikotin fled from the Nazis. He hid his collection in the Netherlands to prevent it from falling into their hands.Felix Tikotin After the war, Tikotin decided that his unique collection should be taken to Israel, and in 1956 he came to Israel and donated the collection to one of Israel's museums. During a visit to Haifa he met Mayor Abba Hushi, and decided that the collection should remain in Haifa, and that he would build a pavilion specifically for exhibiting it here.The Jewish art dealer who changed the way Holland saw Japan, Haaretz Tikotin travelled to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, France, England and Japan to organize support for his idea. He engaged the help of museum directors such as Nagatake Asano (1895‚Äì1965); academics such as Chisaburoh Yamada (1908‚Äì1984) of the Tokyo University of the Arts, who was also chosen to be the first Director of the Japanese Museum in Haifa; spiritual leaders such as Victor M. A. Suzuki, son of the famous Zen philosopher, and others. During the years 1966-1992 the museum was directed by Eli Lancman, who received a prize from the Japanese government in 2001.Japanese Decorations: Awards in Israel opening ceremony of the jubilee celebrations of the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art :he:◊û◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊ê◊ï◊ü ◊ò◊ô◊ß◊ï◊ò◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊§◊†◊ô◊™ At a meeting of the Haifa Municipality on May 18, 1958, it was decided to acquire the \\"Kisch House\\" and its surrounding land. The house was built by Brigadier Frederick Kisch, Chairman of the Zionist Workers' Committee in Israel and Head of the State Department from 1923 to 1931. He lived in the house from 1934 to 1939. Kisch, who commanded the Engineering Brigade of the British Eighth Army, fell in battle during the North African Campaign in April 1943. The Kisch House is still the home of the offices of the Museum, the library, the creativity workshops, and a Japanese room. The library - the largest of its kind in Israel - comprises some 3,000 books and publications relating to Japanese art and culture. In February 1959 plans were approved for a Japanese pavilion, and construction began on the exhibition hall in accordance with the ideas and plans of Felix Tikotin, supervised by the architect M. Lev. The exhibition hall was designed in the Japanese spirit. It is spacious, and has sliding doors of paper leading to the garden, conveying a Japanese atmosphere. On May 25, 1960, the Japanese Museum was opened to the public with an exhibition of works from the donor's collection. In accordance with Tikotin's wishes, a Board of Trustees of the Museum was set up, headed today by his daughter, Ilana Drukker-Tikotin. Collections Bamboo-lined entrance bridge. The Museum's collection comprises some 8,500 items of art and crafts - paintings, prints, drawings, painted screens, textiles, antique illustrated texts, ceramics, miniature carvings (netsuke), lacquer and metal work, antique swords and functional art works, mainly from the 17th to 19th centuries, as well as a collection of modern Japanese art.Meeting Japanese culture face to face The collection has increased over time, and other private collections have been donated. Exhibitions cover different aspects of Japanese culture, displaying traditional and modern art, and emphasizing the aesthetic values unique to Japanese art. According to Japanese custom, a room is sparsely furnished with items selected for specific events and for the season. Hence the exhibitions are changed approximately every three months, and subject, style and period are common to all of them. Exhibitions are accompanied by illustrated catalogues and explanatory texts. The museum store also sells exhibition posters. In 1982 the Japanese philanthropist Ryoichi Sasakawa donated the sum of one and half million dollars for the construction of a large new wing to the museum. It was designed by the Japanese architect Junzo Yoshimura, together with Israeli architect Al Mansfeld of Haifa. It was opened in 1995, and is funded by the Eva Tikotin-Licht Foundation.Discover Haifa: Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art Yoshimura, one of the renowned architects of Japan, designed the National Museum at Nara in Japan and the Japan House, now known as Japan Society (Manhattan), in New York. Mansfeld is known as the architect of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The new wing has two floors and a lower parking area, and extends over 1,800 square metres. The exhibition hall covers 350 sq.m. and is connected to the original hall (300 sq.m.) in the old building. Adjacent to the large hall is a smaller hall of 120 sq.m. On the second floor the Raphael Angel acoustic Auditorium was constructed in 2000, with two hundred seats. A special staircase was connected to lead to the auditorium. The old building is a single story, and its integration with the new building created a single harmonious unit, embodying the Japanese spirit. The addition of these construction elements was planned by the firm Mansfeld Kehat Architects. Educational activities Tikotin's dream was that the Japanese Museum should be a centre for studying Japanese arts and culture and for broadening the Israelis' knowledge about Japan. In the educational branch of the Museum, workshops based on the exhibitions are conducted for schoolchildren and those of kindergarten age, for teachers, and for other groups. Courses are given about the Japanese language, calligraphy and ink drawing, ikebana, cooking, and special activities are held for children.Speech at opening ceremony of the jubilee celebrations There are also Japanese rooms for learning about how people live in Japan, their clothing, food, and homes. The Museum presents a variety of events concerning the arts and culture of Japan. These include lectures, films, the tea ceremony, festivals and special celebrations, many of which are held in the Raphael Angel Auditorium. As a result of its activities, the Museum has become a centre for promoting and understanding the unique Japanese culture, and for establishing closer ties between the two nations. Awards and recognition Since the re-opening of the museum in December 1995, there were some 145 new exhibits most, of which were curated by the Museum's chief curator, Dr. Ilana Singer Blaine,Depicting the Myth, Jerusalem Post who won the award by the Minister of Science and Culture (2007) and the Award of the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs (2014). In 2000, the museum received the Japan Foundation Special Award, which is conferred annually on institutions that make significant contributions to cultural exchanges with Japan.The Japan Foundation Awards: Special Prizes (2000) - Ceremony and Reception In 2003, the Israeli Ministry of Education and Culture's committee for evaluating the quality of exhibitions and collections, ranked the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art second only to the Israel Museum in order of merit.

It is a registered charity and was originally part of Edward Alleyn's College of God's Gift charitable foundation, which also included James Allen's Girls' School (JAGS) and Dulwich College. It has been a member school of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference since 1919. History=Edward Alleyn Edward Alleyn, founder of the School In 1619, Edward Alleyn established his 'College of God's Gift' (the gift of love) with twelve poor scholars. Alleyn's School is a direct descendant of Edward Alleyn's original foundation and was established as a boys' school in 1882. It still exists as part of a foundation alongside Dulwich College and JAGS; For the original College of God's Gift, 24 students had to be chosen from the four parishes with which Edward Alleyn had been connected. Saint Giles, Camberwell (in which Dulwich was situated), Saint Saviour, Southwark (where the Bear Pit stood on Bankside), Saint Botolph, Bishopsgate (where Alleyn was born), and Saint Giles, Cripplegate (home to the Fortune Theatre). Alleyn's became a public school with the election of the Headmaster to the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in 1919. The Lower School The 1857 Act for confirming a Scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the College of God's Gift in Dulwich in the County of Surrey, also known as the Dulwich College Act,An Act for confirming a Scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the College of God's Gift in Dulwich in the County of Surrey, with certain Alterations, 25 August 1857 mandated that the College of God's Gift be separated into an \\"Upper School\\", which became Dulwich College, and a \\"Lower School\\" which became Alleyn's. Separation from the College of God's Gift Reverend J. Henry Smith became the first Headmaster of Alleyn's School, having previously been the Master of the Lower School of the College of God's Gift In 1882, the upper school moved to a new site further south and the lower school stayed put, becoming an independent boys' school. In 1887 it moved to its own site, where the school currently stands. The original school is now the foundation chapel and the offices for the Dulwich Estate, which belongs to the foundation schools. Independence and co-education It was one of 179 direct grant grammar schools from 1958 until the abolition of that status in 1976; at which point the school was still boys-only. The Governors then opted for outright independence and co-education; Chairman Lord Wolfenden explained the decision in the House of Lords on 12 November 1975:DIRECT GRANT GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, HL Deb 12 November 1975 vol 365, cc1846 > As a responsible body of Governors, we were confronted with an extremely > difficult decision. The dilemma is this. Should we, as the phrase goes, > \\"take our place within the pattern of the local education authority\\", or > should we, on the other hand, go independent? In relation to the former of > those alternatives, there are two relevant considerations. The first is > whether the past history and present nature of a school fits in with the > overall structure of the pattern of the local education authority for > children in the Dulwich area.

It means > that there will now be in Dulwich two independent day grammar schools, one > of 1,300 boys and the other of 800 boys, within a couple of miles of each > other. It also means that in order to maintain Alleyn's as an independent > school its fees, with the removal of direct grant, will have to be put up to > something like those of its consistently independent neighbour, Dulwich > College.

Princess Shikishi ( Shikishi Naishinn≈ç) (1149 ‚Äì March 1, 1201) was a Japanese classical poet, who lived during the late Heian and early Kamakura periods. She was the third daughter of Emperor Go-Shirakawa (1127‚Äì1192, reigned 1155‚Äì1158). In 1159, Shikishi, who did not marry, went into service at the Kamo Shrine in Kyoto. She left the shrine after some time, and in her later years became a Buddhist nun. Shikishi is credited with 49 poems in the Shin-Kokin Sh≈´, a collection of some 2,000 popular works compiled in the early Kamakura period, and many other poems included in the Senzai Waka Sh≈´, compiled in the late Heian period to commemorate Emperor Go-Shirakawa's ascension, and later compilations. The poet's name is sometimes also pronounced Shokushi (both are on-yomi readings). Modern given names using the same characters include Shikiko (mix of on- and kun-yomi) and Noriko (pure kun-yomi). Her title, Naishinn≈ç (), means \\"Imperial Princess\\".  Biography  Though her exact date of birth is unknown, it is estimated that Princess Shikishi was born in 1150, and she died in the year 1201. She was the third daughter of Goshirakawa, seventy-seventh emperor of Japan beginning in the year 1155. During her lifetime, Japan saw turbulent times like the H≈çgen and Heiji Disturbances (1156 and 1159), which involved competing samurai clans vying for political power. There were also numerous natural disasters, including a tornado, a famine, and an earthquake, all of which wreaked destruction on Japan's inhabitants. During all this action, Shikishi was cloistered away for much of the time. In 1159, the Kamo Shrines chose her to be their thirty-first saiin, a vestal virgin or high priestess. An emperor-appointed position, the saiin represented the emperor by attending to the primary deities at the major Shinto shrines. To be saiin was an important and luxurious job‚Äîshe factored largely in the annual rite, called the Kamo no Matsuri or Aoi Matsuri, which was celebrated with a great festival every year. She also had many attendants and lived in her own palace, but saiin could be a rather lonely appointment, as the girl would move away from her family and remain mostly separate from the public. As saiin, Shikishi would have lived near the capital, and her large number of attendants provided ample company; however, this career came with many restrictions and the government policies at the time made it difficult for princesses to marry. Shikishi remained in this position for ten years until she became ill, forcing her to depart the shrine in 1169. She dealt with several illnesses over the rest of her life, including what was probably breast cancer. Around 1181, Shikishi became acquainted with Fujiwara no Shunzei, a famous poet of the time with whom she may have studied, and developed a friendship with his son Teika. Teika was also a renowned poet, and it is speculated that Shikishi and Teika were in a relationship. Much of Shikishi's poetry contains a tone of saddened longing, which has led some to believe she dealt with unrequited or unattainable love. Teika kept a thorough journal, in which he chronicles his visits to Shikishi. He and Shunzei would often visit her together, but Teika does not go into detail about these visits, though his concern for her appears in entries during the time when Shikishi's illness was worsening. A couple of times he wrote that he remained through the night, including a time Shikishi was especially ill and he stayed in ‚Äúthe northern corner of the kitchen.‚Äù Scholars disagree about whether or not Shikishi and Teika were lovers, and the evidence is too small to be certain either way. In the 1190s, Shikishi took Buddhist vows to become a nun and adopted the name Sh≈çnyoh≈ç, as she had become a believer in Pure Land Buddhism. Also in the 1190s, there were two separate instances of rumors that she had cursed notable women, one of the instances involving a plot against the government; and some believe she took the vows partly to escape punishment. No action was taken regarding either of these accusations, however. Shikishi was appointed as foster mother in 1200 to the future Emperor Juntoku, and also during this year she wrote a set of one hundred poems for the Sh≈çji ninen shodo hyakushu, the First Hundred-Poem Sequences of the Sh≈çji Era, which was sponsored by her nephew, the Retired Emperor Go-Toba. Go-Toba had directed all notable poets in this year to submit some of their works for this anthology, and Shikishi wrote this set of poems in only twenty days despite being extremely ill. Beginning with twenty-five, eventually forty-nine of Shikishi's poems were chosen for the eighth imperial anthology, the Shin-Kokin Waka Sh≈´ (as opposed to only nine of Teika's), which altogether contained 1,979 poems. For the two decades between Shikishi and Teika's first meeting and Shikishi's death, Teika's diary displays some of the ongoing health struggles Shikishi had until her death in 1201.  Poetry  399 of Shikishi's poems are known of today, many of which are part of three sets: Sequences A, B, and C. The poetry form Shikishi used was called tanka, which involves grouping syllables into a set of 5-7-5-7-7. As this form was rather limited, the most widely used way of experimentation lay in stringing together several sets of these 5-7-5-7-7 lines to make longer poems. Sequences A, B, and C were written in hundred-tanka sequences, called hyakushu-uta, and the rest of her poems are in smaller sets of tanka. Though it is difficult to be certain, Sequence A is thought to have been written sometime between 1169 (perhaps earlier) and 1194. It is believed that Sequence B was written between 1187 and 1194, and it is known for certain that Sequence C, the one she wrote for Go-Toba's poetry collection, was written in 1200 shortly before she died. Sequences A and B both abide by the same subjects and numbers: Spring, 20 poems; Summer, 15 poems; Autumn, 20 poems; Winter, 15 poems; followed by Love, 15 poems; and Miscellany, 15 poems. Sequence C contains the typical set of seasonal poems: 20 for Spring and Autumn, and 15 for Summer and Winter; followed by Love, 10 poems; Travels, 5 poems; Mountain Living, 5 poems; Birds, 5 poems; and Felicitations, 5 poems. The many tanka in a hyakushu-uta each focus on a single component of the greater concept of the poem, coming together to form an interconnected whole. Tanka often made use of the literary technique kake-kotoba, a method that involved using homonyms and homophones. For example, one of Shikishi's tanka reads: As spring comes my heart melts, and I forget how like the soft snow I go on fading Haru kureba kokoro mo tokete awayuki no aware furiyuku mi o shiranu kana In this poem, the segment ‚Äúfuru‚Äù of the word ‚Äúfuriyuku‚Äù means ‚Äúto fall‚Äù (like snow) and also ‚Äúto grow old.‚Äù The poem's use of kake-kotoba connects the idea of the narrator's heart softening at the season's change to the idea that she is aging. Shikishi also used a device called engo, or ‚Äúrelated word.‚Äù Engo involves tying together imagery in a poem by using words that evoke similar ideas. In one poem she writes: Wind cold, leaves are cleared from trees night after night, baring the garden to the light of the moon Kaze samumi ko no ha hare yuku yo na yo na ni nokoru kuma naki niwa no tsukikage Here, the word ‚Äúhare,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúcleared‚Äù (‚Äúleaves are cleared‚Äù), also connects to the image of the clear light of the moon, ‚Äútsukikage.‚Äù Another more content-based technique that appears in Shikishi's writing is honka-dori, the taking of a passage by another poet and incorporating it into one's own work, without acknowledgement. Some may be uncomfortable with this technique, considering its resemblance to plagiarism. However, considering the restrictive structure of tanka, the limited subjects poets were allowed to write on, and the closed-off nature of Kyoto at this time, it is not surprising that different poets‚Äô work would gradually begin to sound similar. Also, within Chinese methods of poetry writing which influenced Japanese poets, including someone else's work within one's own was seen as a tribute paid to another author, not an act of stealing. There are differences in the ways scholars translate Shikishi's poetry. Compare the two translations of one of Shikishi's works here, the first by Earl Miner and the second by Hiroaki Sato: Original: Tamano‚Äôo yo taenaba taene nagareba shinoburu koto no yowari mozo suru Miner's translation: O cord of life! Threading through the jewel of my soul, If you will break, break now; I shall weaken if this life continues, Unable to bear such fearful strain. Sato's translation: String of beads, if you must break, break; if you last longer, my endurance is sure to weaken Here is one of Shikishi's poems from Sequence A, translated by Sato. Spring: 20 poems In spring too what first stands out is Mount Otowa: from the snow at its peak sunrays appear Though warblers have not called, in the sound of cascades pouring down the rocks spring is heard Through a bud-tinted plum tree the evening moon begins to show light of spring As spring comes my heart melts, and I forget how, like soft snow, I go on fading As I look around, now here, now there, it's covered with spring robes, their woof feeble still Isolate my life, seclude it with layers of haze, deeply, at the food of the Hill of Gloom It's spring: to my heart's content I gaze at the treetops shrouded in haze and budding Opening on plum twigs in unfaded snow, the first blossoms for dyeing bring back the past In whose abode did they touch plum blossoms? The scent transferred so distinct on your sleeves Plum blossoms accompanied by a tinge of love: their scent on your coat, distinct, unfaded About blossoms I do not know; there, not there, I look around: haze fragrant on a spring dawn Would there were other means of consolation than flowers: coldly they fall, coldly I watch When I count the seasons past, fleeting, so many springs wistful of flowers I‚Äôve come through Everyone, look at Yoshino's mountain peaks! Are the clouds cherry, the blossoms white snow? I do not know about hilltops with cherry in bloom; now in spring haze a thousand hues fade A spring breeze must have passed the gable eaves: the accumulated snow fragrant where I lie In the moonlight remaining after daybreak, faintly falling blossoms hidden among leaves Warblers, too, wearied as spring ends; no more visits at night and my house is desolate The geese, now heading for home, can't help saying farewell to the clouds aglow at dawn Today's the last; haze with its hues rises and parts, spring at sunset in the hilltop sky A few of her other poems, not included in Sequences A, B, or C: After resigning the vestal‚Äôs post at Kamo, on the Day of the Sacred Tree during the festival someone brought her a gift of aoi to offer her. She wrote on it: At the foot of the god's hills I grew used to aoi; since I parted with it years have passed Among the poems on ‚ÄúLove‚Äù: Does he know: some thoughts, like dayflowers, cling to someone and intensify in color? What to do? Like the waves beating on the beach, I, in unknown love, am shattering myself Untitled: If no one kept what passes in traces of a brush, how could we meet the unknown past?  Recognition  Shikishi was recognized in fifteen out of twenty-one imperial anthologies. Fujiwara no Shunzei included nine of Shikishi's works in the Senzai Waka Sh≈´, the seventh imperial anthology, containing 1,288 poems. The eighth imperial anthology, the Shin-Kokin Waka Sh≈´, compiled shortly after her death, included forty-nine of her poems. 155 of her poems are incorporated throughout the seventh imperial anthology to the twenty-first.

Life  Born in Glogau, Germany, to a Jewish family, his ancestors had returned with Napoleon from Russia from a town called Tykocin. Tikotin grew up in Dresden and became involved with the artistic group of \\"Die Bruecke\\". Tikotin began collecting art in high school. He wanted to study painting but became an architect. In World War I, he was an officer in the German army, fighting first on the Western front in Belgium and later in the East. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. After the war, he travelled to Japan on the Trans-Siberia Express. He fell in love with Japanese culture and in April 1927, he opened his own gallery in Berlin. During World War II, Felix Tikotin settled in the Netherlands. His two daughters were born in The Hague, where he had a gallery in his house. After the invasion of the Nazis, the family moved away from the coast and then, when things became worse for the Jews, the Dutch Resistance helped to find them hiding places. The entire family survived, and the collection was hidden by honest neighbours but was stolen during the war years. Tikotin slowly resumed his activities as a dealer in Japanese art. He became, once again, very successful and prominent. He held exhibitions all over Europe and the United States. In 1955 he organised the first overseas exhibition of the origami by Akira Yoshizawa (in the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam). He also did much to introduce to the West ikebana and some other Japanese \\"specialities\\". When Tikotin first visited Israel in 1956, he decided that the major part of his collection really belonged in that country. He helped to build the first exhibition hall and buy the Kisch House in Haifa. In 1960, the Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art was opened.

In 2008 the village won the Class 2 category, and was placed third overall in the RCCE Best Kept Village in Essex competition.RCCE Blog. Village The village lies in and around a triangle formed by Colchester Road, Chapel Road and Lexden Road. Around the village lie numerous farms and large areas of woodland, including Hillhouse Wood, always known locally as Bluebell Wood, which was purchased by the Woodland Trust with the help of local people. Many walks exist through the wood, and a migrant population of various breeds of deer can sometimes be seen. Elmer's was the butchers shop.

Over the years there has been a confusion in the name of this farm and it has now become commonly known as Armoury Farm. After the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII the estate was sold to Richard DukeAlmoury Road in 1544, who was one of the civil servants responsible for administrating land seized by the King. However, the estate was finally brought back into the Sackville family by John Sackville in 1544.John Sackville 1523-1547/52 Bergholt has not always managed to maintain good relations with the Crown. During the Reign of King John, Jordon Sackville got on the wrong side of the King (Jordon was a rebel Baron and said to be an assistant to one of the twenty-five Peeres of the Reamle to see the Magna Carta signed) and had all of his land removed, including the Bergholt Manor, even though his father and previous Lord of the Manor, Geoffrey Sackville, was knighted by John. However, fortune landed on Jordon's side, as when King Henry III came to the throne in 1216 Jordon was granted all his land back. Although then his grandson, also called Jordon, assisted in the Barons' Revolt against King Henry III, claiming that he was not fit to rule the country in his 60s and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. However, as the King was a friend of his grandfather, he was pardoned after a year.West Bergholt ‚Äì Manors and Other Estates Jordon's heir, Andrew Sackville whose sonne and heire, named Andrew Sackuill, was under age at the time of his father's death and was placed under the King's Ward, was likewise imprisoned in Dover Castle. Nevertheless, by the special command of the King, he married an Honourable Ladie of the household to Queen, whereby he not only gained the King's favour, but the greatest part of his inheritance, gaining the family's land in East Sussex. He died before 1291 and Bergholt Hall passed to his son, another Andrew de Sackville. The second Andrew held the manor until his death in 1316 and was succeeded by his son, a third Andrew de Sackville, who, in 1347, was given free warden in Bergholt by Edward III, allowing him to kill game in his manor. He died in 1370, and Bergholt Hall passed to his widow Maud.Farrer, Honors and Knight's Fees, i. 212-13; E.R.O., T/P 191/11; Morant, Essex, ii. 225; Genealogist, n.s. xvii. 251 During Andrew's reign as Lord of the Manor Bergholt had become one of the poorest parishes in the Lexden Hundred by 1327 with the highest individual taxpayer be assessed being 7s. ¬Ωd,The Medieval Essex Community: The Lay Subsidy of 1327, ed.

Sir Thomas led quite an eventful life, from preventing the Duke of Lancaster, a newcomer to the landed gentry, from holding courts, poaching in the duchy parks and burning a commission issued under the Duke's seal, to being temporarily imprisoned for abetting and harbouring murderers.

The village ale tasters were also fined, as it was their responsibility to keep an eye on such matters.

This was end of the Sackville family in the village, although they kept the right to appoint the Rectors of St Mary's. The village name was not changed to West Bergholt until 1910.Jon Lander, This village should be called Bergholt Sackville, Village Bulletin (2001), Issue 87, pg 5 By the 16th century the village was involved in the booming cloth trade and many of the villagers were employed in removing the natural oils from the cloth and spinning wool. However, this prosperity was almost removed from the village by the 1557 Act of Parliament, which forbade the making or selling of any woollen cloth except in a market town. Thus, the local town of Colchester was unaffected, but Bergholt was not included as part of the town. Consequently, Bergholt allied with Bocking and Dedham and petitioned Parliament for a change in the law. They were successful in passing the Act for the Continuance of the Making of Woollen Clothe in Dyvers Townes in the Countie of Essex. This allowed the three villages, called towns in the act, to carry on their businesses providing they had been trading for seven or more years.J.Lander: A Thousand Years of Village News: How West Bergholt's history made headlines, Jon Lander (1999), pg.9 In 1565, Thomas Love, founder of Love's Charity, died and left a sum of money to acquire land and rent it to the poor of the village,West Bergholt = Charities for the Poor as he had received such a warm welcome when visiting the village during his lifetime. Trouble at the church Queen Elizabeth I had to step in twice to sort out problems with the village vicars. The first troublesome vicar was Reverend Edmund Tarrell, who was noted for spending too much time in the public houses and not enough time in the Church. The Queen had to intervene after it was reported that the vicar had failed to attend evensongWest Bergholt in History: Extracts from the Domesday Exhibition, 1986, West Bergholt Local History Group, p 10 and failing to give the last rites to a woman as he was in a Colchester pub and could not be found.Stubborn Rector His most serious offence, which he managed to escape, was not reading out King Henry VIII's latest religious doctrine, which carried the penalty of death. Later in 1581 the it was reported to the Queen by a member of the congregation that the village's vicar, Reverend Richard Kyrby, refused to conduct the service in English after the introduction of her new Prayer Book, which he claimed should remain in Latin and that the Queen's reforms were \\"politically incorrect\\". Kyrby was tried for treason, which he denied. The case was dropped after the accuser backed down. Sixteen years later the Queen stepped in and had him removed. James I's Coat of Arms in Old St Mary's Church Later on, to remind all the villagers who was king, King James I had his royal coat of arms painted in the Church. This coat of arms can still be seen to this day if one stands in the gallery and looks towards the altar. The motto on the arms reads \\"Exurgat Deus Dissipenter Ininice\\", this is the opening line of Psalm 68Psalm 68 (Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered). Opposite James's arms is a set of Hanoverian arms acquired in 1816.R.Tricker: St Mary's Old Church, The Churches Conservation Trust (1998), pg.9 There is evidence that the village was sympathetic towards the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War as Gregory Holland, inducted as vicar in 1613, was threatened with removal in 1644 as a royalist and conformist, and for ungodly behaviour. He was allowed to retain the living. However, in 1650, Reverend Gregory Holland was called before the Committee for Scandalous Ministers for preaching Royalist sermons during the Civil War, along with drunkenness and swearing in Church. His main offence was preaching royalist sermons and claiming that it was \\"not fir got farmers and tradesmen to know the mystery of their salvation, but only for himself and such as he.\\" The result of this hearing was that he was allowed to continue in his post as vicar at Bergholt, but that the parishioners elect him a curate, who would pay him the majority of his stipend. The curate chosen was nonconformist, Robert Billio.Harold Smith, The ecclesiastical history of Essex under the Long Parliament and Commonwealth, 115, 121, 125, 309 However, a group of parishioners were still not happy with the Rector's views and in 1655 Samuel Skillingham, Mary Cooke and Jonathan Bundock, all waited until the end of the sermon before standing up and giving their view of what he preached and continued afterwards to talk about their own religious experiences, which was typical of Quakers of the time. They were imprisoned in Colchester Castle.J. Sowle, An abstract of the sufferings of the people call'd Quakers (1733), pg 92 Skillingham was also sued for Tithes along with Stephen Davy, John Child, John Crofier, Moses Davy and Daniel Bicknall, but the charges were dropped following the death of their prosecutors.Ibid, p 85 However, Skillingham was later beaten with Zacky Child for attending a meeting at Wethersfield, while John Child had his horse taken from him.Ibid, pg 86 During the Civil War, the Lord of Bergholt Manor was Sir John Denham, a poet and Royalist spy. He was exiled to Holland, along with the rest of the Royal Family, and because of his large gambling debts his property was sold to his political enemy Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet, Recorder and MP for Colchester.

E. Oxley, The Reformation in Essex: to the Death of Mary, New York: Barnes and Noble (1965) She was then tried before the Bishop of London, Reverend Edmund Bonner, along with 12 others.Davids, Thomas, Annuals of Evangelical Nonconformity in the County of Essex, Jackson, Walford and Hodder (1863) pg 44 During her time at Newgate Prison she wrote a letter attacking the Pope for being the Anti-Christ, saying that she was baptised in Christ's Church not Rome and refusing to believe that bread and wine became the body and blood of Christ. She was burned at StratfordWest Bergholt in History: Extracts from the Domesday Exhibition, 1986, West Bergholt Local History Group, p 11 before 20,000 people. In 1879, a large monument was erected in St John's churchyard in Stratford Broadway, to commemorate the thirteen and others who were executed or tortured in Stratford during the persecutions. Agnes's husband Richard, a labourer, was also arrested in 1557. He escaped execution but his second wife, Christine, was also burnt, this time for heresy, along with two others from North Essex. They too were sentenced by Edmund Bonner, who claimed that they were \\"a spirited danger to other Christians\\" and a hazard to the state because they believed in redistribution of wealth. They were held in the Colchester Castle dungeon until 26 May 1558 when they were executed in front of a large crowd outside Moot Hall on the High Street. This was not the end of the saga for the George family. In another hunt for heretics in the parishes of North Essex, twenty- two Protestants, including Richard George, were interrogated at Colchester and were sent to London, bound in chains and rope, for trial. One woman in the group was set free at Chelmsford after agreeing to convert to the Roman Catholic Church. Witness accounts claimed that the rest of the group had ample opportunity to escape and were treated quite well. They were tried at Edmound Bonner's house, where the group took the opportunity to ask the crowd attending to convert to Protestantism. Bonner asked his agents to try to persuade the group to recant but the agents informed him that they were too \\"desperate and obstinate\\". Bonner, fearing that sending too many to the stake would cause unrest and maybe riots, came up with a compromise of a confession of faith that pleased both Catholics and Protestants, which they all signed. The group were then set free to make their own way back to Essex. Alas, Richard George, and his wife, were rearrested for his attitude towards Roman Catholics and imprisoned in Colchester Castle. In a fortunate turn of events for the Georges, Queen Elizabeth was crowned during their imprisonment and ended the persecution of Protestants. They were set free. The King's Wrath In 1540, the son of John Abell, Lord of the Manor of Cooks Hall, Bergholt, was executed at Smithfield on the orders of King Henry VIII. Thomas Abell who was brought up at Cooks Hall in the village, was chaplain to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, whom the King wanted to divorce to marry Anne Boleyn. Henry claimed that when he married Catherine, he had broken God's law and the marriage was invalid. On a secret mission to Spain, the Queen's chaplain sought to destroy the King's case for divorce and back in England, he argued against the King both in print and from the pulpit ‚Äì with the inevitable result.The Queen's Champion by Jon Lander After seven years in the Tower of London he was sentenced to \\"be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, there to be hanged, cut down alive, your members to be cut off and cast in the fire, your bowels burnt before your eyes, your head smitten off, your body to be quartered at the King's will, and God have mercy on your soul.\\"Lander, The Queen's Champion: A Forgotten Hero at the Court of Henry VIII, Up Front Publishing Ltd (2008) There is still to be seen on the wall of his prison in the Tower of London a rebus consisting of the symbol of a bell with an A upon it and the name Thomas above, which he carved during his confinement. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII as one of a group of fifty-four English Martyrs on 29 December 1886. Development of modern Bergholt 1725 is the first year that records of the village's largest pub appear ‚Äì The White Hart, which is still in use today, although frequent fines for unlicensed brewing, breaking the assize of ale, and permitting the playing of illegal games such as tennis, suggest that several alehouses existed in the later 15th and earlier 16th centuries.Essex Records Office, D/DMa M2, rott. 7‚Äì8; D/DMa M3, rott. 9‚Äì13, 16, 21, 26; D/DMa M29, rott. 6‚Äì7, 9‚Äì10. Alehouses were licensed in 1576, 1580, and 1608, although an unlicensed one owned by a collar-maker was suppressed in 1618.Essex Records Office, Q/SR 59/37, 74, 181/113, 223/27 There were three unlicensed alehouses or beerhouses in 1644.Essex Records Office, Q/SBa 6 The White Hart was a popular meeting place for farmers taking sheep and cattle to market, which caused the creation of the cluster of buildings known as the Crescent next to the pub. The Crescent contained four buildings: Anerly, Bascete, the Wheelwright's and the Blacksmith's shop, which original parts of can still be seen, although are all residential houses now. The Anerley was formerly known as The Crown and Sceptre Brewery and the Bascete used to contain a chapel at the rear of the building.B.Skudder & D.Fulford: A Walk Around West Bergholt 2, West Bergholt Local History Group (1987), pg.2 =The Brewery= O. G. Orpen The Daniell family had lived in Colchester since 1509 and were freemen of the town. The first member of the family to start brewing was Thomas Daniel during the 18th century, who produced beer for the workers on his farm. The beer was such a favourite with the men that he started selling it around the village and local area and in 1859 expanded the operation to two new breweries run by his two sons. The firm went from strength to strength and became a public company in 1886, with a value of ¬£30,000. The biggest event for the firm was to have Osmond Orpen marry into the family, who was known as the greatest brewer in England and became the Daniells' head brewer before moving on to be managing director.Orpen Close This had a great impact on the village. Not only did it create more jobs and help expand the village but Osmond also ran the parish council and was overseer of the poor.Rose Growing In his will he, along with Lorkin Daniell, gave the land and money for the building of the village hall (Orpen Memorial Hall) and surrounding land (Lorkin Daniell Playing Field). The rapid growth of the village also encouraged service trades and building. Grocers, butchers, bakers, coopers, poulterers, and dealers in tea and fruit were established by 1851, and increased in number in later decades. Alfred Diss, builder of the new Methodist Chapel (1878), Ebeneezer Villas (1884), and possibly the small Gothic Cottages (1880s), employed 9 carpenters, 9 bricklayers, and 8 labourers in 1881.Essex Records Office, sale cat. A439; Victoria County History Essex, ix. 193, 397, 405 Fluctuations in the building industry were thought to have contributed to serious unemployment in the village in 1912.West Sussex R.O., Add. Manuscript. 732, f. 112 However, one of the most lasting improvements to the village from the legacy of the brewery was the instalment of mains water during the 1930s and then sewage and waste water disposal systems in the mid 1950s. Prior to this the village was supplied by a series of shallow wells (many of which still remain, although bricked up under the village's more modern housing estates), although there were three springs which fed public ponds at the Queen's Head, on Lexden Road, and near the White Hart, and there was a deep well at the brewery.J. C. Thresh, Essex Water Supply, 67-8; Bergholt in Living Memory, 4; Essex Records Office, sale cat. A439; ibid. T/P 181/2/5 An additional public well at the top of Newbridge Hill was closed in 1896 because its water was unfit for drinking. The brewery suffered losses in 1958 and was forced to sell to Truman, Hanbury, Buxton and Co Ltd, who took over the brewery and its 150 tied houses, including the Treble Tile and Queen's Head in West Bergholt. Trumans used the Brewery as a bottling plant and later as transport depot until it was converted into flats in 1989. =Enclosure and fire raising= Moving back to the 1840s, the village was being dramatically changed by the agricultural revolution. The two largest impacts on the village were enclosure and the introduction of machines into the farming process. 2008 View of West Bergholt's Heath In the early 16th century overgrazing affected areas of both Bergholt and Cooks Hall Common, upon which the tenants of both manors shared.Essex Records Office, D/DMa M3, rott. 16‚Äì17, 27; D/DMa M16 In 1575-6 neither unmarried tenants nor under-tenants of Cooks Hall manor were allowed to feed more than four sheep or any cattle on that manor's common.Essex Records Office, D/DL1 M15 In 1587 and 1619 Bergholt Hall manor court forbade any tenant without a house and family to graze cattle on that manor's common.Essex Records Office, D/DC 5/124, rot. 11; D/DMa M15, pg 7 Overseers, rangers or drivers, of that common, first recorded in 1632, were in 1651 instructed to drive the heath at least three times a year and to impound illegally grazed cattle.Essex Records Office, D/DMa M15, pg 13, 20 Encroachment on the heath apparently began in the earlier 17th century when cottages began to be illegally erected on both the Bergholt Hall manor and Cooks Hall manor wastes. By the mid 18th century many encroachments were sanctioned as long as they were registered in the manor courts.Essex Records Office, D/DMa M15, pp. 8, 20, 43‚Äì4; D/DH VI D3B; D/DL1 M3, rot. 2; D/DL1 M5, rot. 1 and d.; D/DL1 M10; D/DC 5/126, rott. 1‚Äì2 Although a few 18th-century intakes were large additions to existing freeholds or copyholds, many were occupied by small cottages or shops; other encroachments included one for a barn, another for a brick kiln, and a third for a house, but most were small and the heath was still largely unenclosed in 1777.Essex Records Office, D/DL1 M 16; Map of Essex (1777) Enclosure happened in Bergholt in 1865, during which the Heath was divided into new areas. The old track ways and footpaths were closed and several new roads were laid out, the most important becoming Chapel Road. of land was given to the poor for allotments and a further for recreation (commonly known in the village as the Poor's Field). This land was held in trust by the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor. The maximum amount of land a single man was allowed to cultivate, without disturbance to his daily work, was ten rod measurements, which is still in use today. A third area was set aside for a new church and graveyard, as the church was too far from the centre of the modern village, and this, it was claimed, was the cause of the low attendance. The remaining area of the land was left as the Heathlands, where villagers were able to graze their goats. The land hand-out was carried out under the provisions of the Acts of Enclosure, Exchange and Improvement of Land. There were intended to produce the most economical use of the Heath, although largely disregarded the rights of commoners.Hill: The World Turned Upside Down, Pelican, pg.53 The plan was produced by Charles Horror and approved by the Enclosure Commissioners. The plan also contained land set aside for three village ponds (\\"public wells\\"); one for Lexden Road, Chapel Road and outside the White Hart,Enclosure Award & Map 1865, West Bergholt Local History Group although the latter has been filled in since the 1950s. The only opposition apparently came from gypsies camping on the heath.Victoria County House: Essex, ii. 336 n The agricultural revolution was not all good news for Bergholt. Many farm labourers had been left unemployed after the dip in the agricultural trade following the war with France in 1815. and the new Poor Law. Thus, the introduction of machines only made matter worse. The result was groups of vagabonds emerging in the countryside threatening social order,E. M. Wood: The Origin of Capitalism, Monthly Review Press (1999), pg.83 who were described at the time as \\"masterless men.\\"N. Wood: The Foundations of Political Economy: Some early Tudor Views on State and Society, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press (1994) In 1842 the village witnessed the earliest signs of violence from the protesters, which led the village to become the epicentre of protest in North Essex. Their main form of protest was fire raising. Among the victims were Robert Bradbrook and Thomas Daniell, two of the most important farmers and businessmen.A. F. J. Brown, Essex People, 1750‚Äì1900, 177; E.J. xxi. 45 One of the first fires occurred in 1843 at Hightrees Farm, which killed a horse, a calf and several poultry, as well as burning away worth of hay and damaging the farmhouse. It is claimed that the fire could be seen from Colchester, where a large crowd gathered on North Hill. This was the first of many fires. The Police had trouble tracking down the perpetrators as many in the village were sympathetic towards them. However, in 1843 Robert Woodward was found guilty of fire raising after an undercover policeman in the White Hart and his lover came forward with evidence. He was sentenced to transportation for life to Australia. During this period the village Cricket Club was founded on its original location to the west of the brewery,.Peter Wormell, A history of the parish of West Bergholt, Colchester Wiles & Son (1946), p 29 The first recorded cricket match in the village was a decade earlier between the Gentlemen of Essex and the Gentlemen of Norfolk played over three days commencing on 15 July 1831. The Essex County Standard reported that although the bad weather effected the amount of cricket that could be played, with delays on the first two days, there was considerable interest in the game. Essex won by 89 runs.West Bergholt Cricket Club History: Part 1 ‚Äì the early years, West Bergholt CC By the 1940s the club had moved to its current location on Manor Road. A football club was not formed in the village until 1911. it was nicknamed The Brewers, and played mostly friendlies using the cricket ground as a pitch. The current West Bergholt FC was founded in 1938 and became stable enough to maintain membership of a league, playing on its current location of the Memorial Field. The first success of the club came in 1981 winning the Border League Division 2.Club History, West Bergholt FC =Education= Frederick Sims' Grave The village by the 19th century already had a fee-paying school, but nothing for the poor. The vicar at the time, Reverend William Sims, had already applied to the Church of England for funding for the building of a school for the poor, but by 1833 he had raised only ¬£55 of the ¬£300 needed and appealed again. By then the village had grown in numbers and more money was needed for a larger school than originally planned. However, William Sims died before he could see the fruits of his labour. Fortunately the next vicar, his son, Frederick Sims, was able to raise ¬£400 by public subscription. The school was built on the Heath and two cottages were made alongside it: one for the schoolmaster and his wife and the other to be let out with the rent going towards the upkeep of the school. The school was initially built to accommodate 200 pupils, and the opening ceremony was held at the parish church during the Sunday Eucharist. Governance West Bergholt is part of the electoral ward called West Bergholt and Eight Ash Green. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 5,074. The buildings Interior of the \\"Old Church\\" (St Mary's) As well as two active churches, St. Mary's Anglican Church and West Bergholt Methodist Church, the village has a third church, not used for regular services, which is also called St. Mary's. Several legends exist about the church and its history. Locally called \\"St Marys' Old Church\\", it used to be in the centre of the village, but as time passed the village grew away from it. While no longer in regular use, it remains consecrated and it is maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust. Like many churches it has evolved over the years. Parts date from the 11th century and the astute observer will find reused Roman bricks in its fabric, and ancient graffiti from pilgrims who have visited over the years. It is positioned at the end of what is little more than a farm track in the East Anglian countryside, and on the Essex Way long distance footpath. It stands in a small graveyard that features a headstone with a death's head design.

It uses resources that facilitate information sharing outside the constraints of time and place among a network of people.. In many instances, well-constructed asynchronous learning is based on constructivist theory, a student-centered approach that emphasizes the importance of peer-to-peer interactions.. This approach combines self-study with asynchronous interactions to promote learning, and it can be used to facilitate learning in traditional on-campus education, distance education, and continuing education. This combined network of learners and the electronic network in which they communicate are referred to as an asynchronous learning network. Online learning resources that can be used to support asynchronous learning include email, electronic mailing lists, threaded conferencing systems, online discussion boards, wikis, and blogs. Course management systems have been developed to support online interaction, allowing users to organize discussions, post and reply to messages, and upload and access multimedia.. These asynchronous forms of communication are sometimes supplemented with synchronous components, including text and voice chat, telephone conversations, videoconferencing, and even meetings in virtual spaces such as Second Life, where discussions can be facilitated among groups of students. History The roots of asynchronous learning are in the end of the 19th century, when formalized correspondence education (or distance learning) first took advantage of the postal system to bring physically remote learners into the educational fold. The 1920s and 1930s saw the introduction of recorded audio, desynchronizing broadcasting and revolutionizing the mass dissemination of information. The first significant distribution of standardized educational content took place during World War II; the branches of the US military produced hundreds of training films, with screenings numbering in the millions.. Online asynchronous learning began with schools' and universities' substantial investment in computer technology in the early 1980s. With seminal applications such as Seymour Papert's Logo programming language, students were able to learn at their own pace, free from the synchronous constraints of a classroom lecture.. As computers entered more households and schools began connecting to the nascent Internet, asynchronous learning networks began to take shape. These networks augmented existing classroom learning and led to a new correspondence model for solitary learners. Using the web, students could access resources online and communicate asynchronously using email and discussion boards. The 1990s saw the arrival of the first telecampuses, with universities offering courses and entire degree plans through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous online instruction... Today, advanced multimedia and interactivity have enhanced the utility of asynchronous learning networks and blurred the divide between content-creator and content-consumer. New tools like class blogs and wikis are creating ever-richer opportunities for further asynchronous interaction and learning. Development of an asynchronous community Though the social relationships integral to group learning can be developed through asynchronous communication, this development tends to take longer than in traditional, face-to-face settings.. The establishment of an asynchronous community takes time and effort and tends to follow a projected course of five stages, as described by Waltonen-Moore et al.: # Introductions ‚Äì This might include a full biography or a short \\"getting-to-know-you\\" questions. Through this step, community members begin to see one another as human beings and begin to make a preliminary, emotive connection with the other members of the community. This step is often characterized by emotive or extravagant language and represents group members' attempts to make themselves known as living individuals behind the emotionless technology medium.. # Identify with the group ‚Äì Members begin to communicate with one another by reference to their commonalities as group members and seek to either establish or make known norms for successful membership. If this sense of group identity is not established, the likelihood of poor participation or attrition increases. # Interact ‚Äì Members will start interacting with one another in reference to the community's established focus and begin to share information with one another. If the community is an online learning course, then students will begin to discuss course content. # Group cohesion and individual reflection ‚Äì members of the group will begin to validate one another's ideas and opinions while, at the same time, being reflective of their own. # Expansive questioning ‚Äì Now feeling completely comfortable within the environment, focused upon the content, and respectful of other group members' thoughts and experiences, members will begin to not only post facts and deeply held beliefs, but will actually start to \\"think out loud\\", allowing other group members to take part in their personal meaning-making and self-directed inquiry. Asynchronous communities that progress efficiently through these stages tend to share at least three common attributes: First, the community has an active facilitator who monitors, guides, and nurtures the discourse. Unguided communities tend to have difficulty progressing beyond the second stage of development, because group members can become distracted from the community's intended purpose. Second, rather than seeking to take on the role of an instructor or disseminator of knowledge, the facilitator recognizes that knowledge is an individual construct that is developed through interaction with other group members. Thus, facilitators within successful communities tend not to be pedantic, but supportive. And third, successful asynchronous communities permit a certain amount of leniency for play within their discourse. That is, communities that insist upon being overly stringent on etiquette and make no room for the social development that comes from play seem to drive away participants. Rather than enriching discourse on the targeted topic, such attitudes have a negative impact on group identity development and individual comfort levels which will, in turn, decrease overall involvement. Roles of instructors and learners Online learning requires a shift from a teacher-centered environment to a student-centered environment where the instructor must take on multiple new roles. The constructivist theory that supports asynchronous learning demands that instructors become more than dispensers of knowledge; it requires that they become instructional designers, facilitators, and assessors of both grades and their teaching methods. As instructional designers, emphasis is placed on establishing the curriculum, methods and the media through which the content will be effectively delivered. Once the design is in place and executed, the instructor must then facilitate the communication and direct the learning. Instructors typically have to be proficient with elements of electronic communication, as asynchronous courses are reliant on email and discussion board communications and the instruction methods are reliant on virtual libraries of e-documents, graphics, and audio files. Establishing a communal spirit is vital, requiring much time commitment from the instructor, who must spend time reading, assessing, reinforcing, and encouraging the interaction and learning that is happening.. The student-centered nature of asynchronous online learning requires students to be actively involved with and take more responsibility for their own learning. In addition to their normal duties as learners, students are required to: * Become proficient with the technology required for the course; * Use new methods of communication with both peers and instructors; * Strengthen their interdependency through collaboration with their peers.. Strengths Asynchronous learning's greatest benefit to students is the freedom it gives them to access the course and its instructional materials at any time they choose, and from any location, with an Internet connection. This allows for accessibility for diverse student populations, ranging from traditional, on-campus students, to working professionals, to international students in foreign countries. Asynchronous learning environments provide a \\"high degree of interactivity\\" between participants who are separated both geographically and temporally and afford students many of the social benefits of face-to-face interaction. Since students can express their thoughts without interruption, they have more time to reflect on and respond to class materials and their classmates than in a traditional classroom. Research shows that the time required to initially design an asynchronous course is comparable to that of a traditional synchronous course. However, most asynchronous courses have the potential to reach far more students than a traditional course and course-wide updates or modifications can be disseminated far more quickly and efficiently than traditional lecture models. Schifter notes that a perceived additional workload is a significant barrier to faculty participation in distance education and asynchronous learning, but that perception can be mitigated through training and experience with teaching in these environments. Another advantage of asynchronous learning (and, as technology develops, many synchronous learning environments) is that there is a record of nearly everything that occurs in that environment. All materials, correspondence, and interactions can be electronically archived. Participants can go back and review course materials, lectures, and presentations, as well as correspondence between participants. This information is generally available at any time to course participants. Shortcomings Asynchronous learning environments pose several challenges for instructors, institutions, and students. Course development and initial setup can be costly. Institutions must provide a computer network infrastructure, including servers, audio/visual equipment, software, and the technical support needed to develop and maintain asynchronous learning environments. Technical support includes initial training and setup, user management, data storage and recovery, as well as hardware repairs and updates.. Research indicates faculty members who are hesitant to teach in asynchronous learning environments are so because of a lack of technical support provided by their institutions. However, for faculty to teach successfully in an asynchronous learning environment, they must be technically adept and comfortable enough with the technological tools to optimize their use. To participate in asynchronous learning environments, students must also have access to computers and the Internet. Although personal computers and web access are becoming more and more pervasive every day, this requirement can be a barrier to entry for many students and instructors. Students must also have the computer/technology skills required to participate in the asynchronous learning program.

The creek is divided into two parts. The first part lies between Ghodbunder and Thane, a section from where the Ulhas river flows from the north of Mumbai Island to meet the Arabian Sea on the west. The second part of the waterway lies between the city of Thane and the Arabian Sea at Trombay / Uran, before the Gharapuri islands. Thane Creek was formed due to a seismic fault lying below it which runs from Uran to Thane. In antiquity, Thane served as the capital of the Sheelahar kingdom, and was a large functional port for trade with the Arabian peninsula, along with other ports, such as Ghodbunder and Nagla Bunder. The region of the Thane Creek has been recognized as an Important Bird Area by the Bombay Natural History Society, as it is home to various avian species. In particular, it harbors populations of flamingos and several other migratory and wading birds.  Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary  The Maharashtra Government has declared the area along the western bank of the Thane Creek as the \\"Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary\\". It will be Maharashtra's second marine sanctuary after Malvan sanctuary. The sanctuary was notified in Govt. Gazette on 6 August 2015.

Its population has steadily decreased over the past years, going from 41,538 recorded in the 1989 Census to 35,511 in the 2002 Census to 31,809 in the 2010 Census. Etymology The origin of the name of Staraya Russa is unclear. The most involved and widespread hypothesis was presented by philologists and linguists R. A. Akheyeva, V. L. Vasilyev, and M.V. Gorbanevsky. According to this hypothesis, Russa comes from Rus'‚Äîa Slavic people, who settled in the vicinity to control trade routes leading from Novgorod to Polotsk and Kiev‚Äîwhich, in turn, is usually thought to originate from an Old Norse term for \\"the men who row\\" (rods-) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (the rowing crews) or Roden, as it was known in earlier times.The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text Translated by O. P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor Staraya is Russian for \\"Old\\". History Thought to have originated in the mid-10th century, it was first mentioned as Rusa (Cyrillic: –†—É—Å–∞) in chronicles for the year 1167 as one of three main towns of the Novgorod Republic, alongside Pskov and Ladoga. After Pskov became independent, Russa became the second most important town and trade center of the Novgorod Republic after Novgorod itself. By the end of the 15th century, it contained about one thousand homesteads. Brine springs made the saltworks the principal business activity in the town, which was the biggest center of salt industry in the Novgorod region. Catherine II appointed German mineralogy expert Franz Ludwig von Cancrin as director of the salt-works in 1783. The wooden fortifications of Russa burned to ashes in 1190 and then in 1194, after which they were replaced by the stone fortress. In 1478, it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow together with Novgorod. The word Staraya (Old) was prefixed to the name in the 15th century, to distinguish it from newer settlements called Russa. Nevertheless, the current name firmly established only in the 19th century, when the salt mining settlements around the town became collectively known as Novaya Russa (New Russa). When Ivan the Terrible ascended the throne in 1533, Staraya Russa was a populous town. During the Time of Troubles, it was held by Polish brigands and heavily depopulated. Only thirty-eight people lived there in 1613. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Staraya Russa was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. In 1776, Staraya Russa became the seat of Starorussky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed into Novgorod Governorate. In the 1820s, military settlements were organized in Staraya Russa and around, in accordance with the project designed by Aleksey Arakcheyev, an influential statesman. It was inconvenient to have both civil and military administration in Staraya Russa, and therefore the uyezd was abolished in 1824. The town of Staraya Russa and some adjacent territories were directly subordinated to the Defense Ministry. The military settlements were proven inefficient, in particular, in 1831, the area participated in the Cholera Riots. They were abolished in 1856. In 1857, Starorussky Uyezd was re-established.Snytko et al., p. 26 The Soviet authority in Staraya Russa was established on November 5(18), 1917. In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Starorussky District was established, with the administrative center in Staraya Russa.Snytko et al., p. 85 Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On September 19, 1939, Staraya Russa was elevated in status to that of a town of oblast significance and thus ceased to be a part of the district.Snytko et al., pp. 137‚Äì138 The town was occupied by the Germans between August 9, 1941 and February 18, 1944. Totally destroyed during the war, it was later restored. On July 5, 1944, Staraya Russa was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since. On February 16, 1984, Staraya Russa was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Staraya Russa serves as the administrative center of Starorussky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #559-OZ As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated separately as the Town of oblast significance of Staraya Russa‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts (one of the three in Novgorod Oblast). As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Staraya Russa is incorporated within Starorussky Municipal District as Staraya Russa Urban Settlement.Law #377-OZ Economy ruble coin depicting Staraya Russa, 2003 Industry The biggest enterprise in Staraya Russa is the aircraft repair works. The mechanical engineering plant went bankrupt in 2011 and no longer exists. Transportation A railway which connects Bologoye and Pskov passes through Staraya Russa. Staraya Russa is connected by roads with Novgorod, Demyansk, and Bezhanitsy via Kholm. There are also local roads. There is a wharf on the Polist River in the Lake Ilmen basin. The Polist is navigable downstream from Staraya Russa. The town is served by the Staraya Russa Airport. Attractions The Transfiguration Monastery Church of St. George the Victorious Staraya Russa is a spa, celebrated for its mineral springs used for baths, drinking, and inhalations; medicinal silt mud of Lakes Verkhneye and Sredneye and mud from artificial reservoirs.

Monuments include the Transfiguration Monastery, which includes a cathedral built in seventy days in 1198 and partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and several 17th-century buildings and churches. The principal city cathedral (1678) is dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ. Other notable churches are consecrated to St. George (1410) (the Dostoyevsky family stayed in the house of the priest of this church), Mina the Martyr (14th century), and the Holy Trinity (1676).

The narrower, northern part of the estuary is called Thane Creek. The harbour opens to the Arabian Sea to the south. The historical island of Elephanta is one of the six islands that lie in the harbour. Front Bay is the official name of the harbour, so named because the city started as a tiny settlement facing the harbour. The waterbody behind the original settlement, forming an arc between the former Colaba island and Bombay island, up to the Malabar Hill promontory or peninsula, was similarly called Back Bay. Front Bay is home to the Mumbai Port, which lies in the south section of the western edge of the harbour. Jawaharlal Nehru Port and Navi Mumbai lie to the east on the Konkan mainland, and the city of Mumbai lies to the west on Salsette Island. The Gateway of India with its jetty for Elephanta is the most important tourist destination, followed by the maritime Museum. Islands Bombay harbour 1626 The harbour east of the city Two American Cargo ships docked at Bombay Harbour, 1948. There are six islands in the Mumbai Harbour. Butcher Island, also known as Jawahar Dweep, is used as an oil terminal by the Mumbai Port. It has jetties for tankers and various other infrastructure for offloading crude oil and for loading refined petroleum products. The island is restricted to port employees, and not open to the public. Cross Island is a small, uninhabited islet just off the coast of the Dockyard Road. Though the remains of old fortifications are visible, the island itself is restricted to the public. Gharapuri Island, also known as Elephanta Island, is the best known of the islands in Mumbai Harbour. The Elephanta Caves located on the island are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The group of five larger caves have intricate Hindu religious rock sculptures. Two smaller caves have Buddhist religious sculptures. The carvings date back to between 5th and 8th centuries. Middle Ground Coastal Battery is a small islet in the Thane creek. It features an antique coastal gun battery of the Indian Navy. The guns salute Indian naval vessels returning from deployments when they enter the harbour. Oyster Rock is a small group of rock outcroppings in the harbour. The area has restricted access since it is used for naval exercises. Salsette Island is the large island on which the cities of Mumbai and Thane are located. It is separated from the Konkan mainland by the Vasai creek and the Ulhas river. Mumbai was originally a distinct island from Thane, but reclamation of land has long since merged the islands. Powai Lake, Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are the largest lakes on the island.  Mumbai Port Mumbai Port (MbPT) lies midway () on the western shore of Mumbai Harbour. The port was the pre-eminent commercial port of India in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is known as the gateway to India, and has been a primary factor in the emergence of Mumbai as the commercial capital of India. Ecology Mangrove swamps line much of the northwestern and eastern shores of the harbour, and provide a rich habitat for wildlife, including thousands of migrating birds such as flamingoes. Pollution Due to immense population pressures from the Mumbai metropolitan region and the extremely busy maritime trade, the Harbour is considered to be heavily polluted. This includes reports of heavy metals flux found in the creeks adjacent to the harbour with the harbour acting as a sink for most of the pollutants.

He was formerly the vice president and general manager for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). His tenure with the team was from 2003 to 2008 before being replaced by Cliff Fletcher in January 2008. He is married to Providence College graduate, Stephanie Paiva. He is the son of the NHL player John Ferguson, Sr. Playing career Drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, the team with which his father had played every one of his NHL games, in the 12th round of the 1985 NHL Entry Draft, Ferguson played four professional seasons at the American Hockey League (AHL) level with the Canadiens and Senators organizations. He was alternate captain of the 1992 Fredericton Canadiens that won the AHL regular season championship. Ferguson was named the team's \\"unsung hero\\" in consecutive years (1991, 1992). He played his college hockey at Providence College, where he served as an assistant captain, was an Academic All-American and graduated magna cum laude with a degree in business administration in 1989. Post-playing career Ferguson was a player agent responsible for negotiating player contracts, product endorsements and player recruitment. From 1993 to 1996 he was a member of the Ottawa Senators scouting staff as an amateur and professional scout. During that time he also spent the summers of 1994 and 1995 at the NHL office in the hockey operations and legal departments. Following his professional hockey career, he graduated cum laude with the degree of juris doctor from the Suffolk University Law School and was admitted to the Massachusetts State Bar in 1996. St. Louis Blues Ferguson served as vice president and director of hockey operations for the St. Louis Blues, and before that he was assistant general manager for the club for five seasons. In that role he evaluated players at the professional and amateur level and negotiated player contracts. Ferguson was also the president and general manager of the Worcester IceCats and was influential in the negotiation and acquisition of the Blues' top minor league affiliate. He is a former chairman of the AHL's Competition Committee and also served on the league's Legal Affairs Committee. Toronto Maple Leafs On August 29, 2003, at the age of 36, Ferguson became the 12th general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He succeeded Pat Quinn, who retained his duties as head coach after serving in a dual capacity for the previous four seasons. Leafs President Ken Dryden was given a seat on MLSE's board of directors and shuffled to the post of Vice-Chairman, where he was no longer in the Leafs management reporting hierarchy. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, the first after lockout, the Leafs narrowly missed the postseason. Quinn took the blame from the MLSE front office for the team's failure to make the playoffs and was let go as head coach. Quinn's firing upset some longtime Leaf fans, with many calling for the firing of Ferguson himself. The Leafs had finished the season 9-1-2 despite season-ending injuries to Eric Lindros, Jason Allison, Alex Khavanov and Ed Belfour, with TSN criticising Ferguson for signing these players. Many of the young players, who were key contributors to the Leaf's late-season run for a playoff spot, were drafted by Quinn prior to Ferguson's arrival. Ferguson also drew criticism for a trade which brought Mark Bell to the Leafs. Bell was convicted for a hit and run and driving under the influence while with the San Jose Sharks; the NHL (which wanted to crack down on off-ice behavior) suspended Bell for his first fifteen Leafs games. Entering the 2007‚Äì08 season the Leafs had posted a .577 points percentage during Ferguson's tenure, establishing franchise records for points (103), wins (45-tie), home wins (26) and road wins (23) in a season. The team lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 2003 playoffs, in seven games, and were again eliminated by the Flyers in 2004, in six games during the second round. The Leafs reached at least 90 points and 40 wins in each of the three seasons played. However, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in the last two of the four seasons under Ferguson. The team was out of a playoff position at the time of his dismissal, near the bottom of the league. After weeks of media speculation, on January 22, 2008, Ferguson was informed his Leafs' contract would not be renewed when it expired on June 30, 2008. He was relieved immediately from his duties as general manager, and was replaced by returning former Maple Leafs GM Cliff Fletcher. Team Canada In 2007 Ferguson served as a member of Team Canada management at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Russia. He collaborated with Steve Yzerman in selecting Canada's unbeaten gold medal roster, the youngest team to ever win a World Championship. After the Leafs At the 2007-08 NHL Season's trade deadline, Ferguson provided analysis of the trades as they came in for TSN. From 2008 to 2014 he served as a scout for the San Jose Sharks of the NHL. On June 26, 2014, he joined the Boston Bruins as Executive Director of Player Personnel.http://bruins.nhl.com/club/m_news.htm?id=724120 On September 16, 2016, he was also given the position of general manager of Boston's American Hockey League affiliate, the Providence Bruins.

It is the capital of both the Apur√≠mac Region and the Abancay Province.  Name  The word Abancay comes from a corruption of the Quechua Amankay meaning Lily. Location Abancay is located at an elevation of above sea level in the southern Peruvian Andes, above the Pachachaca River, and straddles the Marino River. Because of its dry mountain and famous year-round warm weather it is known as \\"The Eternal Springtime Valley\\". The nearest cities are Cusco, Chalhuanca and Andahuaylas. Abancay is located at the junction of two important Peruvian roads: the Caminos del Inca Road, an old road dating from Incan times, between the cities of Nazca and Cusco, and the Via de los Libertadores, connecting Ayacucho and Cusco. Panoramic view of Abancay History Abancay was already a populated area before the arrival of the Incas. It was the frontier of the Quechua-Inca cultural influence area of the Chancas, an ethnic native group of Peru. Its name comes from a flower native to the region called . When the Spanish arrived, they transliterated the word and named the city Abancay, Villa de los Reyes (\\"Abancay, Village of the Kings\\"), which was later reduced to Abancay, its current name. Abancay was the location of the Battle of Abancay between the forces of the Conquistadores Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. Abancay was mentioned in the first Cronicas (Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n) as an encomienda dedicated to the cultivation of sugar cane for the production of aguardiente. Abancay Cathedral's Bells Tower There is a traditional tale about the foundation of the city recorded by Guillermo Vidalegut, a local journalist, in his book \\"Alma y Rostro de Abancay\\", who, inspired by Ricardo Palma's Tradiciones Peruanas, gathered local traditional stories. As the story goes, during colonial times, the town was located above the valley, in one of the skirts of the Ampay mountain, in a place which is now known as Ccorhuani. One day, the statue of the Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of the Rosary, Patroness of the village, mysteriously disappeared from the local Church. The people, fearing robbery and claiming sacrilege, searched day and night until a shepherd found the statue standing above an immense boulder by the valley. The people believed that the thieves had left the statue in fear of being discovered by the search parties. The statue was returned in a procession back into town. A few weeks later, the same disappearance occurred again and another search ensued. The statue was again found in the same spot where it was found before. Lo and behold, the disappearance happened a third time. The people never understood why or how this was happening. Finally, it was suggested that maybe the statue was asking for a shrine in the valley at the location where it was being found. The town then built a small Chapel there, and it became a place of constant visits by the people. Before long, it became the center of activity, and the entire town was moved to where is located today. The statue of Our Lady of the Rosary still sits above the immense boulder which is located on the right side of the Cathedral. Ocampo Park in Abancay Economy Abancay is the agricultural center, as well as the industrial center of most of Apur√≠mac. Sugar is milled, along with rum and other liquor distillation. There are copper mines in the area, and they are also known for their sericulture. Population The population as of 2014 is 58 000 which has more than doubled the city in size since 1990 when the population was 29,200. Tourism The Carnival is the town's main celebration festival. It is famous as one of the best Peruvian ethnomusical festivals. It takes place from the last week of February through the last week of March. The comparsas contest and Yunsa games, with people dressing in local traditional costumes, fills the streets of the city. Every social group, from market vendors, students, government officials, teachers, etc., participate in the games which also have the support from the local and regional government due its cultural relevance. The city's surroundings have some astonishingly beautiful landscapes, such as the Ampay National Sanctuary, a wildlife sanctuary and a frontier within the Andes, and the Clouded Forest of the Amazonian Basin, located north of the city where the mountain called Apu Ampay (the Lord of Ampay, in the indigenous cosmology) is also located. Apu Ampay reaches heights of approximately 5,300 meters above sea level. There are also cave paintings, meteorite crash sites, lagoons, waterfalls, wildlife, orchids, and the famous Intimpa tree (a unique tropical conifer preserved by an effort led by the World Wildlife Fund) constitute a few of the attractions that nature lovers will find. Uspaccocha Lagoon, at the National Wildlife Sanctuary of Ampay. Some of the Choquequirao structures The Pachachaca River is famous for its colonial bridge and its rapids where canyoneering and whitewater kayaking can be practiced. It is one of the best and longest Peruvian locations for this. Remains of The Pachachaca State, an important producer of sugar and brandy during colonial and republican times, is now one of the major attractions of the city. Pachachaca Colonial Bridge, Abancay The Saywite Archeological Site, a famous temple and adoration center dating from Inca times, is located a few kilometers from the city. Therein is the world- renowned Saywite Stone. The stone is a roughly spherically-shaped monolith that has a representation of the Inca world. It suggests that the Incas had a much better understanding of astronomy than Europeans gave them credit for. There is Taxi service from the city. The Konoc Hot Springs (Cconocc, in Quechua) is a resort located a few kilometers from Saywite and is one of the best places in Peru to enjoy thermal baths from volcanic waters. It is claimed that regular baths in the springs can cure arthritis, asthma, and psoriasis. Abancay is the gate to the Inca city of Choquequirao, next to the Apur√≠mac River, which is considered as important as Machu Picchu. There is evidence that the real dimensions of the city are much larger than what has been uncovered, excavated and studied until now. Education=High schools Abancay is home of the high school Colegio Nacional \\"Miguel Grau\\". Since its founding in the 1880s, it has educated each generation of the city. The main festivity of the school is on October 8, and it is a day in which all the alumni reunite and celebrate companionship. It is a tradition that the classes which are celebrating their Silver and Gold jubilees head the expensive festivities. Universities Abancay, despite its small size, is an important center of higher education. The city is home of one state university, Universidad Nacional Micaela Bastidas de Apurimac, and two private universities, Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de los Andes and Universidad Alas Peruanas. There are also two college-level institutions, Escuela Normal La Salle, for careers in education, and SENATI for industry-related training.

The pavilion contains a reconstructed mine, smelting furnaces, and findings from the Egyptian-Midianite mining temple at Timna.Nechushtan, official museum website, accessed 22 April 2020 The reconstructed Chalcolithic and Late Bronze Age mine displays mining tools such as stone hammers, flint blades and copper chisels, as well as the typical marks they left on the rock. Four smelting furnaces are on display: * Bowl furnace from the Chalcolithic period (4th millennium BCE) * Domed furnace of the Late Bronze Age (14th‚Äì13th centuries BCE) * Authentic Late Bronze Age furnace (12th century BCE) * Shaft furnace of the Iron Age (10th century BCE). =Midianite temple pavilion= In the 14th century BCE, the Egyptian pharaohs dispatched mining expeditions to Timna. Alongside expert metalsmiths from the Land of Midian, they extracted copper at Timna until the early 12th century BCE. This pavilion houses a Midianite temple model. Of special interest is the copper snake with gilded head found in the Midianite shrine, reminding of the biblical Nehushtan, \\"the bronze serpent that Moses had made\\" (). Glass pavilion This pavilion exhibits ancient glass vessels. The exhibition is divided into three sections, representing three eras in the history of glass production: pre-blown glass (Late Bronze Age to Hellenistic period‚Äî15th-1st centuries BCE), blown glass of the Roman and Byzantine periods (1st‚Äì7th centuries CE), and blown glass of the Islamic period (7th‚Äì15th centuries CE).

Its stated mission is to \\"promote the interests of members, advance the science, arts and ethics of dentistry and improve the nation‚Äôs oral health.\\" Structure The majority of the BDA‚Äôs 22,000 members are family dentists, working in general practice providing both National Health Service (NHS) and private care. BDA members also work in community and hospital settings, universities and the British armed forces. The BDA‚Äôs headquarters is in Wimpole Street, London near Queen's College, London in the City of Westminster and it currently has offices in Stirling, Scotland, Belfast, Northern Ireland and Cardiff, Wales. History By the 1870s leading dentists including Sir John Tomes and Sir Edwin Saunders (one of Queen Victoria‚Äôs dentists) formed the Dental Reform Committee, to help bring unity, organisation and code of ethics to the dental profession. This Committee campaigned successfully for the first legislation to regulate dentistry, the Dentists Act, 1878 which limited the title of \\"dentist\\" and \\"dental surgeon\\" to registered practitioners. Qualified practitioners and those who could show they had practised dentistry for five years prior to 1878 were the only ones eligible to register. The Dental Reform Committee called for a nationwide meeting to establish the BDA in 1879. Finally established in 1880 the BDA elected Sir John Tomes as its first President. Much of the BDA‚Äôs early work involved prosecuting dentists in breach of the Dentists Act. One active member of the BDA was Charles Edward Wallis, being on the association's representative board for six years. He also wrote extensively for the BJD. The Dentists Act of 1921 created the Dental Board of the UK to administer the Dentists Register. Thus the BDA was freed from legislation, and rapidly emerged as the leading consultative body and voice for the dental profession. The 1921 Act introduced a provision that only registered individuals could practise dentistry. However, unqualified practitioners were given opportunity to register if they could show they had been practising dentistry for five years prior to 1921. The last unqualified dentist ceased practise during the 1970s. In 1946 Lilian Lindsay became the first female president of the BDA. The BDA headquarters were opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 1967. Function The organisation represents dentists at national and local level, ensuring that the views and concerns of the profession are high on the political and public agenda. The BDA promotes good practice and patient care, and provides members with expert advice in all aspects of practice, management and opportunities for continuing professional development. The organisation is also a scientific society promoting higher standards (often in co-operation with other organisations) and improvements in the oral health of the nation. Publications The BDA produces regular dental publications, including the British Dental Journal, BDJ In Practice, BDJ Student and BDJ Team. British Dental Association Museum Its museum in Wimpole Street holds the largest collection of dental material in Britain. It includes dental instruments, equipment, furniture, photographs, archives, fine and decorative art. The museum is maintained as a national resource for the dental profession, dental industry, researchers and members of the public and aims to promote an appreciation of dentistry today through an understanding of its past.Museum website The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health & Medicine. The museum also offers an enquiry and research service for individuals wanting to learn more about the history of dentistry or whether their ancestors were dentists. On several occasions the museum has also been used as a professional consultant on television series such as Call the Midwife.https://www.facebook.com/thebritishdentalassociation/posts/1375945475759804 British Dental Association Library The Robert and Lillian Lindsay Library was opened in 1920.

It is the largest museum in Northern Ireland, and one of the components of National Museums Northern Ireland.  History  The Ulster Museum was founded as the Belfast Natural History Society in 1821 and began exhibiting in 1833. It has included an art gallery since 1890. Originally called the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery, in 1929, it moved to its present location in Stranmillis. The new building was designed by James Cumming Wynne. In 1962, courtesy of the Museum Act (Northern Ireland) 1961, it was renamed as the Ulster Museum and was formally recognised as a national museum. A major extension constructed by McLaughlin & Harvey Ltd to designs by Francis Pym who won the 1964 competition was opened in 1972 and Pym's only completed work. It was published in several magazines and was until alteration the most important example of Brutalism in Northern Ireland. It was praised by David Evans for the \\"almost barbaric power of its great cubic projections and cantilevers brooding over the conifers of the botanic gardens like a mastodon\\". Since the 1940s the Ulster Museum has built up a good collection of art by modern Irish, and particularly Ulster-based artists. In 1998, the Ulster Museum merged with the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and the Ulster-American Folk Park to form the National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland. In July 2005, a ¬£17m refurbishment of the museum was announced, with grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL, usually pronounced as 'Dee-Kal'). In October 2006 the museum closed its doors until 2009, to allow for the work. Illustrations of historic interest of interiors before alterations will be found as nos 183 and 237 in Larmour, P. 1987.P.Larmour 1987 Belfast An Illustrated Architectural Guide. Friar's Bush Press. The redevelopment drew criticism from many significant figures in the architectural community and the Twentieth Century Society, especially for changes to the Brutalist character and dismantling of the spiral sequence of rooms in the Pym extension. The museum reopened in October 2009, eighty years to the day since its original opening. Within a month over 100,000 people had visited the museum. The reopening saw the introduction of Monday closure, which has received criticism from the public and in the press. All NMNI sites are to close on Mondays. This decision is being reviewed by DCAL. Collections The Malone Hoard of 19 polished Neolithic axe heads The museum has galleries covering the history of Northern Ireland from the earliest times to the very recent past, collections of art, mostly modern or ethnographic, historic and contemporary fashion and textiles, and also holds exhibitions. The scientific collections of the Ulster Museum contain important collections of Irish birds, mammals, insects, molluscs, marine invertebrates, flowering plants, algae and lichens, as well as an archive of books and manuscripts relating to Irish natural history. The museum also maintains a natural history website named Habitas. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s it had a permanent exhibition on dinosaurs which has since been scaled back considerably. There is also a collection of rocks, minerals and fossils. Irish archaeology The museum contains significant finds from Northern Ireland, although in earlier periods these were often sent to the British Museum or later Dublin, as with the Broighter Hoard, now in the National Museum of Ireland. Objects in the museum include the Malone Hoard of 19 polished Neolithic axe heads, the Moss-side Hoard of Mesolithic stone tools, the important Downpatrick Hoard of Bronze Age gold jewellery, part of the Late Roman Coleraine Hoard, the Viking Shanmullagh Hoard, and the medieval coins in the Armagh City Hoard and Armagh Castle Street Hoard.For fuller details see List of hoards in Ireland There are other significant objects of the Bronze Age gold jewellery for which Ireland is notable, including four of the 100-odd surviving gold lunulae, and some important early Celtic art, including a decorated bronze shield found in the River Shannon, and the Bann Disk, bronze with triskele decoration.

BotanyThe herbarium (BEL)= The herbarium in the Ulster Museum (BEL), is based on specimens from Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society (founded in 1821); the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club (founded in 1863); the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery (formed 1905) and the herbarium (BFT) of the Botany Department of The Queen's University, Belfast acquired in 1968. In total the number of specimens is more than 100,000. Although specimens from Northern Ireland are well represented, specimens from elsewhere in the world have been acquired by donation, exchange and purchase. All branches of the world's flora are represented: algae, lichens, fungi, mosses and pteridophytes (ferns), conifers and angiosperms. Little information about the Irish flora before 1830 is available, the oldest specimen in the Ulster Museum is an alga: Batrachospermum moniliforme (BEL: F41) collected in 1798 by John Templeton, other specimens of Batrachospermum, originally incorrectly identified as Thorea ramoissima were collected by John Templeton in 1815 from a \\"boghole\\" in Co.

Art collections The collection contains works by: * Jean Dubuffet * Morris Louis * Anthony Caro * Karel Appel * Francis Bacon * Joseph Beuys * Eduardo Paolozzi * Jean-Robert Ipoust√©guy *Marjorie Bloch Fashion and textiles The Ulster Museum's Fashion & Textiles Collection aims to reflect the history of fashionable dress from as early as the 18th century, as well as contemporary international designer and high street fashion. It comprises approximately 5000 objects including garments, accessories, historic and contemporary jewellery, and a collection of dolls and toys including pieces by Armand Marseille. The museum's policy is to collect clothing and accessories as an Applied Art, with an emphasis on acquiring pieces that are of high design quality and/or representative of significant changes in fashion history. The collection includes eighteenth-century Spitalfields silk gowns, early 20th century Parisian couture, and contemporary international fashion . Designers represented in the collection include Chanel, Dior, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, Vivienne Westwood and JW Anderson. The textiles collection includes pieces by important female Irish embroiders, such as the 'Lennox Quilt' of 1712 by Martha Lennox, and a bedcover by the renowned eighteenth-century letter-writer and artist, Mrs Mary Delany. The Antrim bed furniture, a complete set worked by or under the supervision of Lady Helena McDonnell, 1705‚Äì83, daughter of the 4th Earl of Antrim was purchased in 1982. Tapestries include 'Arabesque' by Joshua Morris and the mid-20th century Adam and Eve by Louis le Brocquy. The textiles collection also includes two large linen wall hangings, Oc√©anie ‚Äì Le Ciel and Oc√©anie ‚Äì La Mer, by the French artist Henri Matisse. =Malone House fire= The Ulster Museum's original collection of costume and textiles was almost completely destroyed in a fire following the 1976 bombing of Malone House in Belfast in November 1976, during the Troubles conflict. Malone House was a large house in a public country park and was the headquarters of the National Trust in Northern Ireland at the time. By Autumn 1976 the Ulster Museum's original costume and textile collection had been moved from unsuitable storage in the museum to Malone House. The museum held the top floor of the building which had been converted into costume and textile storage areas and a textile conservation workshop. On 11 November, gunmen gained entry to Malone House and planted two bombs, one on the ground floor and on the first floor. A five-minute warning was given, and everyone in the building was safely evacuated. Although some rooms on the ground floor were relatively unharmed, the costume and textile collection on the second floor collapsed on top of the fire and quickly perished. The collection included a collection of linen damask that was reckoned to be the best in the world after that of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Rijksmuseum. Both Irish and Continental linens were represented. One of the earliest items of costume destroyed in the fire was a lady's jacket of around 1600 with well-preserved polychrome silk and silver thread embroidery. The original Ulster Museum costume collection had a good selection of 18th-century garments costume, most with local connections such as a Spitalfields silk robe and petticoat of c.1745 which had on the linen lining the stamp 'Sam Holmes ‚Äì County Down'. Specimens of ladies' dresses existed for almost every year from the end of the eighteenth century until the 1970s. There were gaps in the range of men's costume, the eighteenth century being one of the best represented periods. The lace collection was comprehensive but with a bias towards Irish manufacturers. Lace had been collected on a proper systematic basis for longer than any other category of costume or textiles. Among the few objects to survive were the museum's tapestries, which were still stored in the museum building at the time of the fire (the Pilgrimage to Mecca set by Paul Saunders, a Flemish 17th century verdure tapestry, an arabesque probably by Joshua Morris and a le Brocquy), the museum's large new jewellery collection, largely donated by the jewellery collector and historian, Anne Hull-Grundy, the Lennox Quilt ‚Äì a highly embroidered signed and dated quilt of 1712 by Martha Lennox, and four 1950s and 1960s cocktail and evening dresses which were also on display. Rebuilding the Fashion Collection The Ulster Museum's declared aim immediately after the bombing was to try to replace the lost collection as soon as possible. Due to having to restart the collection from almost nothing, the museum was forced to re-examine its collecting policy. The main criterion became to collect fashion and textiles as an Applied Art and that it \\"must reflect the tastes and cultural interests and aspirations of the time it was made\\". Rebuilding the collection was helped by the museum's right to government compensation to indemnify its losses. This enabled the museum to purchase historic fashion and couture from auctions in Christies and Sothebys on a regular basis throughout the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This enabled the Ulster Museum, almost alone in Great Britain, to be able to compete with American and continental dealers on equal terms for items which were considered particularly appropriate to the collection. Notable pieces in the collection include a cut velvet and metal thread suit worn by the 'Black Rod' of the Irish Houses of Parliament in 1751, a number of very fine women's outfits of mid 18th century Spitalfields silk. It is the 20th-century haute couture and contemporary fashions are the most distinctive elements of the collection. Many important designers are represented, from Paul Poiret, Coco Chanel and Christian Dior to Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood. Collecting Contemporary Fashion Since 1984 the Ulster Museum has acquired both International Designer Outfit, High Street Outfit every year. This policy has enabled the Ulster Museum to build a comprehensive overview of late 20th and 21st-century fashion. Recent acquisitions include a 'We Should All Be Feminists' t-shirt by Maria Grazia Chiuri for Dior, pieces by JW Anderson, and pieces by Raf Simons for Calvin Klein. The Ulster Museum holds work by most important 20th century Paris designers and very many post-war English and Irish designers. High Street labels such as Wallis and Etam are also represented. Magazines and contemporary photographs are systematically kept to complement actual specimens.

Life Plaque at his last residence, Heinestra√üe 4, 2nd district of Vienna Jura Soyfer was the son of the industrialist Vladimir Soyfer and his wife Lyubov. The well-to-do Jewish family employed French- and English-speaking governesses for Soyfer and his older sister Tamara. In 1921, the family fled from the Bolshevist revolution and arrived in the town of Baden near Vienna. They later moved to Vienna. At the age of 15, Soyfer began studying socialist writings and became a staunch Marxist. In 1927, he joined the Verband der Sozialistischen Mittelsch√ºler (the Association of Socialist Mittelschule pupils). His early experience with languages meant that Soyfer soon developed a feeling and love for language and wordplay. In 1929, this led to his becoming a member of the Politischen Kabarett der Sozialdemokraten (Political Cabaret of the Social Democrats) where he gained his first experience in writing for the stage. From December 1931, Soyfer wrote two weekly political satires, one in the Arbeiter-Zeitung (Workers' Newspaper) and the other in the social-democratic weekly Der Kuckuck (The Cuckoo). He also wrote two articles for the Politische B√ºhne (Political Stage, a socialist newspaper connected to the Red Players group of actors). These demanded that theatre become more politicised, and that it should stop producing mere distraction and entertainment. In this respect Soyfer approaches Bertolt Brecht's \\"epic theatre\\". Soyfer also satirised the key authoritarian figures of the Austrofascist (1933/4 to 1938) period like Engelbert Dollfu√ü, Ernst R√ºdiger Starhemberg and Kurt Schuschnigg. In August 1935, through the writer and theatre critic Hans Weigel, Soyfer was introduced to Leon Askin, an actor and director at Vienna's popular \\"ABC Theatre\\", a political cabaret. This is where most of Soyfer's pieces were later performed. \\"Jura-Soyfer-Gasse\\", , Wien-Favoriten In 1937, Soyfer was mistaken for (a leader of the Communist Party of Austria) and arrested. When it was discovered that Soyfer himself had also written incriminatory pieces, he was imprisoned for three months. On 17 February 1938, he was freed as part of an amnesty for political prisoners. He remained freed for only 26 days. On 13 March 1938, he was arrested as he tried to cross the Austrian border at St. Antonien Joch above Gargellen into Switzerland. He was later transported to Dachau concentration camp. Here, Soyfer met the composer Herbert Zipper, and together they wrote the famous Dachaulied, the Dachau song, which cynically took up the Nazi motto Arbeit macht frei (\\"work liberates\\"), written above the entrance to such camps. In the autumn of that year, Soyfer was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp where he died of typhoid fever the day after his release was granted, on 16 February 1939. His remains were sent to the United States and are buried at the Hebrew Free Burial Association's Mount Richmond Cemetery. Jura Soyfer's gravesite at Hebrew Free Burial Association's Mount Richmond Cemetery Works Soyfer's first work, Der Weltuntergang oder Die Welt steht auf kein' Fall mehr lang (\\"The End of the World\\", or \\"The world is certainly not going to last much longer\\") was first performed in the early summer of 1936; the last performance took place only a short time later on 11 July 1936. It shows humanity before the Apocalypse, the destruction of the world by a comet ‚Äì the violent repression of the revolutionary masses and the blindness of the people waiting for the end of the world. In the end, the comet does not find the heart to destroy the world, which gives the play a positive ending, but also underlines the frustrating incorrigibility and stupidity of human beings. His second work, Der Lechner Edi schaut ins Paradies (translated into English as \\"Journey to Paradise\\") depicts an unemployed person who sets off to find those guilty for his distress in the past, with the help of a time machine. Eventually he discovers that the cause for his condition is the creation of humanity. The play ends, however, with a call to people to make decisions, including political ones. In this way, Soyfer connects pathos with the typical element of cabaret, political criticism. Soyfer's third play is Astoria, a reaction to the problematic use of the word Vaterland which had been discussed in Austria since 1918. \\"Astoria\\" is a non-existent land which is the focus of the hopes and aspirations of the characters in the play. Their utopic dreams are constantly destroyed by reality. This point is made clearly at the end of the play by a song of praise the actors sing about the country when they are actually being sent to prison. In 1937 Soyfer wrote Vineta. In this piece he leaves behind traditional Austrian theatre and portrays absurd actions and speech which lead irretrievably to downfall and destruction. The protest against facts which are seen as unchangeable, and the idea of \\"not wanting to know\\" are both themes of the play. Vineta is a warning against war and against illusions which are created to suppress people. Soyfer also wrote Broadway Melodie 1942 for the \\"ABC Theatre\\". It is an adaptation of Columbus by Kurt Tucholsky and Walter Hasenclever. Soyfer kept the original satire of the clergy and court society, but his political criticism of society is far more radical. The way the play sees events from the point of view of the lower classes makes it a classic piece of Volkstheater Wien (Austrian popular theatre); it becomes clear that, in the imagination of the playwright, the lower classes of society are actually superior to the upper classes (or at least should be). During his imprisonment from 1937‚Äì1938, Soyfer began writing another play which was to be about Adolf Hitler. Nothing has survived of these drafts. The first verse of the ', the Dachau song:001-wein-kunst.de Stacheldraht, mit Tod geladen, ist um unsre Welt gespannt. Drauf ein Himmel ohne Gnaden sendet Frost und Sonnenbrand. Fern von uns sind alle Freuden, fern die Heimat, fern die Fraun, wenn wir stumm zur Arbeit schreiten, Tausende im Morgengraun. Doch wir haben die Losung von Dachau gelernt und wurden stahlhart dabei: Sei ein Mann, Kamerad, bleib ein Mensch, Kamerad, mach ganze Arbeit, pack an, Kamerad, denn Arbeit, Arbeit macht frei! Barbed wire, loaded with death is drawn around our world. Above a sky without mercy sends frost and sunburn. Far from us are all joys, far away our home, far away our wives, when we march to work in silence thousands of us at the break of day. But we have learned the motto of Dachau and it made us as hard as steel: Be a man, mate, stay a man, mate, do a good job, get to it, mate, for work, work makes you free! Resonance Jura Soyfer's intent was not to present any complete solutions or conclusions: he believed that the problems he presented could only be solved in real life, in actual protest. His plays destroy illusions and call upon us to change society in its present form. He himself saw his own plays as a means for propaganda with a direct connection to the times in which he lived. Soyfer's plays were published as a collection for the first time in 1974 thanks to the work of members of the organisation of exiled Austrians in England, \\"Young Austria\\". This took his works out of their original context and gave them a larger application: they were presented, for example, as timeless criticisms of the society of the communist GDR. Personal life Until his death, Soyfer was engaged to Helli (Helene) Ultmann, a first cousin of the famous stage mind reader and hypnotist Erik-Jan Hanussen (Hermann Steinschneider) (source: Jenny Zundel, n√©e Steinschneider, 1915-2012, another cousin).

A market town and administrative centre developed during the Ottoman Empire, it is one of the most important medium-sized cities in the country. It is situated on a mountain ridge, surrounded by fertile land. As of 2005, it had a population of 160,000.  History  Local men Ibb has been occupied since ancient times, and due to its strategical importance, the Ottomans used it as an administrative centre. It thrived as a market town and the Ottomans established the Wednesday market in Ibb. Ibb was governed by a semi-autonomous emir until 1944, when the emirate was abolished. At times in its history many people have migrated to Ibb from areas of Yemen which had been experiencing drought, to find work in farming. In the mid 1950s there was reportedly an outbreak of smallpox in the city. German explorer, Hermann Burchardt, photographed the city in 1901, photos now held at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.Ibb, by Hermann Burchardt (Click on photo to enlarge); Whitewashed houses .  Climate  Ibb is located at an altitude of on a spur of Mount ShamƒÅ·∏•ƒ´.
