The village is about northeast of the market town of Malmesbury and a similar distance south of the Gloucestershire market town of Cirencester. The Swill Brook forms part of the northern boundary of the parish. History A settlement of 28 households at Wochesie was recorded in Domesday Book of 1086. There was a church at Oaksey in the 12th century, and in 1377 there were 86 poll tax payers. Norwood Castle is an earthwork about north of the village at Dean Farm. It may be the remains of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. An early manor house, near the church, was in ruins by 1593. Oaksey Park House, a three-storey manor house, was built in the early 17th century, possibly for Sir Henry Poole. It was demolished in 1956. Parish church All Saints Church, Oaksey The Grade I listed Church of England parish church of All Saints existed by the first half of the 12th century, and the nave walls of the current building may date from that time. In the 13th century the chancel was rebuilt and the three-bay south aisle was added, along with the south porch. The Decorated GothicPevsner & Cherry, 1975, page 362 north porch was added in the first half of the 14th century. The five-bay Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added in the first half of the 15th century. Further Perpendicular Gothic additions were made early in the 16th century: the south aisle was extended to form the south chapel, new windows were inserted in the north wall of the nave, the third stage of the tower was added. A number of wall paintings were painted in the church either in the 15th century or early in the 16th century. Those that survive today include a painting of Saint Christopher with a mermaid, one of Christ surrounded by instruments of torture as a warning to Sabbath breakers and a badly damaged one of Saint Edmund. In 1553 the tower had three bells, one of which had been cast at Worcester. In 1773 these were replaced by a ring of six new bells cast by Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester. In 1960 the ring was recast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. Amenities Oaksey has a pub, the Wheatsheaf Inn. A village hall was opened in 2000. Oaksey has primary school, a shop and Post Office, a cricket club, a football club which plays in the Cirencester and District League and a branch of the Women's Institute. Oaksey Park Airfield (ICAO code EGTW) has two grass runways and is operated by Austen Aviation Services. The Cotswold Water Park extends into the eastern part of the parish. Railway The Golden Valley Line between Swindon and Cheltenham was built across the parish in 1841. Between 1929 and 1964 there was a small station (Oaksey Halt) where the road to Somerford Keynes crossed the line. The nearest station is Kemble, about 3 miles distance by road.

In 1957 the book was made into a six-part BBC television drama series starring Patrick Troughton and Daphne Slater. Under its French title 'Sarn', it was produced as a television play by French Television ORTF in 1968, with Dominique Labourier as Prue, Josep Maria Flotats as Gedeon and Pierre Vaneck as Kester; the director was Claude Santelli. In 1989 it was again adapted for British television by the BBC, directed by Christopher Menaul and starring Clive Owen and Janet McTeer. Synopsis The story is set in rural Shropshire during the Napoleonic Wars. It is narrated by the central character, Prue Sarn, whose life is blighted by having a Cleft lip and cleft palate. Only the weaver, Kester Woodseaves, perceives the beauty of her character, but Prue cannot believe herself worthy of him. Her brother Gideon is overridingly ambitious to attain wealth and power, regardless of who suffers while he does so. Gideon is set to wed his sweetheart Jancis, but he incurs the wrath of her father, the cruel and scheming self-proclaimed wizard Beguildy. An act of vengeance by Beguildy makes Gideon reject Jancis and tragedy engulfs them both. Prue is wrongly accused of murder and set upon by a mob, but Kester defies them and carries Prue away to the happiness she believed she could never possess because of her Cleft lip and cleft palate. The setting for the story has been attributed to the Meres of northern Shropshire, but is more likely to have been the area around Bomere Pool which was closer to the author's own home at Spring Cottage on Lyth Hill and the travel writer S. P. B. Mais recorded being taken to the pool to see the location of ‚ÄúSarn‚Äù in the 1930s. These locations remained very rural at the time the novel was written, and Mary Webb was herself very much part of local country life there in the 1920s. Webb uses the rural setting to isolate Prue Sarn and her fellow characters from the larger world; at one point Prue tells us, \\"four years went by, and though a deal happened out in the world, naught happened to us. The title of the story has a double meaning. It is taken from John Milton's Paradise Lost (Book I, lines 690-692): :Let none admire :That riches grow in Hell; that Soyle may best :Deserve the precious bane. It refers to the love of money, which, as Prue records, blights love and destroys life. But the title also refers to Prue's deformity, which she comes to recognize as the source of her spiritual strength. In one of the most moving passages in the book, she relates: \\"...there came to me, I cannot tell whence, a most powerful sweetness that had never come to me afore... as if some creature made all of light had come on a sudden from a great way off, and nestled in my bosom.... Though it was so quiet, it was a great miracle, and it changed my life.... If I hadna had a hare-lip to frighten me away into my own lonesome soul, this would never have come to me.... Even while I was thinking this, out of nowhere suddenly came that lovely thing, and nestled in my heart, like a seed from the core of love.\\" Main characters The critic G. K. Chesterton wrote that the characters in this novel \\"live a hard life; they probably on occasion live a hungry life; they are quite capable in some circumstances of living a gross or ferocious life. But they do, in a very deep sense, live a full life.\\" Prue Sarn ‚Äì The narrator of the novel is in her teens when we first meet her. She is loving towards her mother, obedient to her demanding brother. The natural world of Shropshire offers her some consolation to the back-breaking work on the farm, and the fact that she can read and work with numbers is a source of pride and solace. Her \\"hare-shotten\\" lip is her own bane, and she bears it at times with dignity, at other times with deep feelings of shame. The English poet and critic Glen Cavaliero writes that \\"...Prue is spirited and stoical, with a vein of humor and no self-pity: her hare-lip is a source of wonder to her as much as heartbreak.\\" Gideon Sarn ‚Äì A few years older than Prue, he inherited both his father's farm and cruel temperament. He is Prue's opposite number, taking no delight in nature, and showing little affection for his aging mother. Above all else he is motivated by money, and relentlessly works the farm, and Prue, to get ahead. His single- minded determination to become rich is symbolized in part by his decision to put most of his fields in wheat (called corn in the book in accordance with British usage), the crop that was at the time the most lucrative. Beguildy - Owner of a neighboring farm, a man more committed to his wizardry and spells than to his fields and crops. A poor or more likely lazy farmer, he is often gone for days at a time, working charms and spells believed to heal the sick and injured in the community. He teaches Prue to read, write and work with numbers, but shows little care for his wife and daughter. Jancis Beguildy - The wizard's daughter and Gideon Sarn's intended wife, plump, blonde with a lush, pleasing mouth always forming a lovely \\"oh.\\" Missis Beguildy - Beguildy's wife who fears her husband and yet doesn't hesitate to collude with Gideon and Jancis in their plans to be together. She is crafty in her methods to get her husband out of the house for days at a time, and she is sharp in her observations of the people in the community. Kester Woodseaves - He is a skilled itinerant weaver, making his living by traveling through Shropshire, weaving in the homes and farms. He is intelligent and compassionate - he prevents a bull baiting from taking place on a market day in town, but pays dearly for his efforts. He is a discerning judge of character, quickly recognizing Prue's qualities despite her deformed lip.

The first network was set up by the incumbent Belgian telecom operator Belgacom and has been expanding ever since. In 2004 nearly 90% of the entire territory had access to ADSL from Belgacom. Belgacom's daughter company Skynet was the first officially supported ADSL provider, but now many more have gained popularity and almost all provide full triple play services (Television/Internet/Telephone). Alongside the Belgacom ADSL network, several operators including Scarlet, Mobistar and Versatel have created a secondary network, based on local loop unbundling. In 2009 the competitors of Belgacom started to offer VDSL2 connections instead of ADSL2+. Belgacom, rebranded into Proximus in 2014, is the only owner of historical telephone networks, available to households, in Belgium. Other providers use Proximus's infrastructure as well. =Providers= * EDPnet * Orange * Proximus * Scarlet * Telenet * United Telecom Cable Belgium also has cable networks. The biggest one, taken over by Telenet in 1997, covers almost all of Flanders. Speeds vary from 100 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s down. As of June 2020, 93% of Telenet's nodes support Gigabit speeds. If Gigabit speeds are not available on a customer's node, the second fastest speed Telenet offers for residential plans, is 400 Mbit/s. Even with Gigabit download speeds, upload speeds are limited to 'only' 40 Mbit/s for residential plans. It is believed Telenet will not increase their upload speed, because DSL can not exceed 40 Mbit/s upload due to hardware restrictions, until Proximus rolls out supervectoring. This means that for most households, 40 Mbit/s upload is the maximum they can get. Only providers using fiber and LTE networks offer faster uploads, but home internet over LTE is nowhere near as popular (yet), and FttH networks are still pretty new in Belgium and not widely available. As of 2020, Telenet and VOO are the only owners of coaxial networks (originally built for transferring radio and TV signals). Other providers use their infrastructure as well. ;Providers * Numericable-SFR. (multilangual Brussels).

(Wallonia (French speaking part) and multilangual Brussels) Bandwidth and transfer limits Download speeds in Brussels are now reaching a good level, however, the majority of Belgians have bandwidth caps in place to limit the amount of data users can transfer through their connection. Typically these are between 5GB/month and 1000GB/month and show that the competition in this market has not been strong enough to drive out these practices which have vanished in other western and eastern European countries. In June 2008 the Belgian Internet providers Dommel and Yabu ADSL announced nationwide ADSL subscriptions without the data limits. In February 2010 the major operators of Belgium, including Telenet and Belgacom, announced tariffs with unlimited caps, but still with FUP formulas (fair usage policy). However, some of them have adapted the FUP so it only counts on specific hours of the day. IPv6 adoption In 2014, Belgium has the world's highest adoption rate of IPv6 connectivity.

The episcopal see is Laval Cathedral in the city of Laval. Created in June 1855, the diocese was originally erected from the Diocese of Le Mans, and corresponds to the department of Mayenne. Under the Ancien R√©gime the diocese of Mans had an Archdeacon of Laval, whose responsibilities extended over the deaneries of Ern√©e, √âvrun, Laval and Mayenne.L√©on Ma√Ætre, Dictionnaire topographique du D√©partement de la Mayenne (Paris: Imprimerie nationaloe 1878), p. vii. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo. The current bishop is Thierry Scherrer, appointed in 2008.Dioc√®se de Laval, Biographie de Mgr Scherrer, retrieved: 2017-05-14. On 10 April 2017 he announced the first diocesan synod ever to be held in Mayenne, to commence on 23 May.Dioc√®se de Laval, Un synode pour le Dioc√®se de Laval, retrieved: 2017-05-14. In 2013 there was one priest for every 1,780 Catholics. History At the beginning of the Revolution, the Constituent Assembly decided that the number of dioceses in France was excessive, and that approximately fifty of them could be eliminated. Those that survived would have their boundaries changed to coincide with new departmental subdivisions of France. This was contrary to Canon Law, which reserved the creation and suppression of dioceses, as well as the appointment and transfer (translation) of bishops to the Pope. In creating the new department of Mayenne, the French government produced a territory in which there was no established bishopric. The very large former diocese of Mans (now called Sarthe) was divided, and the western half given to the diocese of Mayenne, situated at Laval. A new Metropolitanate was created (the M√©tropole du Nord-Ouest), with its center at Rennes, embracing the department-dioceses of Ille-et-Vilaine, C√¥tes du Nord, Finist√®re, Loire-Inf√©rieure, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, Morbihan, and Sarthe.Pisani, p. 125. In March 1791 the electors of the Department of Mayenne met to elect a constitutional bishop. These electors did not need to be active members of the Roman Catholic Church, nor even Christians. The election, therefore, was blasphemous and schismatic. The office of bishop was first offered to Abb√© de Vauponts, the Vicar General of the (former) diocese of Dol. After some hesitation, he refused, and won a commendation from Pope Pius VI. On 20 March, the electors then turned to Father Noel-Gabriel-Luce Villar, a native of Toulouse and teacher of rhetoric at the Coll√®ge de Toulouse, and then principal of the Coll√®ge de la Fl√®che.Bouiller, pp. 34-38. He was consecrated in Paris by the Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel on 22 May 1791.Tableau, p. 22. Pisani, pp. 142 and 457. Gobel had been consecrated titular Bishop of Lydda in 1772, and therefore the consecration of Villar was valid, though uncanonical and schismatic.Pisani, p. 53. The new bishop returned to Laval, and was installed in the church of la Trinit√©, which served as a cathedral for the Constitutionals. Only twnety-two ecclesiastics signed the record.Bouiller, p. 38. Villar participated in the Legislative Assembly, and voted King Louis XVI guilty, though not requiring the death penalty. In 1794, when Reason replaced Religion in France, he abandoned his ecclesiastical activities and no longer said Mass. He did not resign his bishopric, however, until 3 October 1798, under pressure from his Metropolitan, Bishop Le Coz.Pisani, p. 143. He died on 26 August 1826.Tableau, p. 22. In October 1798 Bishop Le Coz was able to authorize an election, by the priests of Mayenne, to provide a successor to Bishop Villar. They chose Charles Fran√ßois Dorlodot (or D'Orlodot), the cur√© of the church of S. V√©n√©rand in Laval, and Bishop Le Coz confirmed the election on 6 February 1799. Dorlodot was consecrated at Laval by Le Coz and the constitutional bishops of Saint-Brieuc and Vannes on 7 April 1799. He took part in the provincial council held by Le Coz in Rennes, and then in the national council held in Paris in 1800.Pisani, p. 145. On November 29 1801, by the bull Qui Christi Domini, Pope Pius VII suppressed all of the Roman Catholic dioceses in France, and reinstituted them under papal authority. The Constitutional Diocese of Mayenne (Laval) was ignored by the Vatican, which had played no part in its existence. In 1802 the French government suppressed the diocese of Mayenne (Laval),Bouiller, pp. 363-368. and Dordolot was named a Canon of Mans. He continued to reside in Laval, however, and found employment as librarian of the √âcole Central until 1810, when he followed his patron Le Coz to Besan√ßon.Boullier, p. 372. He died in Besan√ßon on 3 January 1816.Pisani, p. 146-147. In 1846 the creation of the new diocese was decided upon, but was not carried out until after the death of Bishop Jean-Baptiste Bouvier of Le Mans on 29 December 1854. A Bull of Pope Pius IX, June 30, 1855, established the See of Laval. The apologist Emile Bougaud was consecrated Bishop of Laval in February 1888, and died a few months later. The request of the Holy See in 1904 for the resignation of Bishop Pierre-Joseph Geay (1896-1904) was one of the reasons assigned by the French Republic for breaking with the pope and preparing the separation of Church and State. In August 1859 Bishop Casimir-Alexis-Joseph Wicart held a diocesan synod in the √©glise S. Michel in Laval. Bishop Grellier held a synod in November 1913.

He was consecrated a bishop on 6 September 1896 in Lyon by Archbishop Pierre-Hector Couilli√©.

Yandarbiyev was fatally wounded and died on the way to the hospital while his 13-year-old son Daud was seriously injured and arrived in critical condition. According to some reports, two of his bodyguards were killed as well.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4261459/ns/world_news/t/ex-chechen-president- dies-blast/#.XpbYYsgzbDc retrieved= 15 March 2010 It was initially unclear who was responsible for the blast, but suspicion fell on SVR or GRU, denying any involvement, or internal feuding among the Chechen rebel leadership. Aslan Maskhadov's separatist Foreign Ministry condemned the assassination as a \\"Russian terrorist attack\\", comparing it to the 1996 attack that killed Dzhokhar Dudayev. The car bomb led to Qatar's first anti-terrorism law, declaring lethal terrorist acts punishable by death or life imprisonment. Investigation and trial On February 19, 2004, the Qatari authorities arrested three Russians in the Russian embassy villa for the murders. One of them, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Qatar, Aleksandr Fetisov, was released in March allegedly due to his diplomatic status and the remaining two GRU agents: Anatoly Yablochkov (also known as Belashkov) and Vasily Pugachyov (sometimes misspelled as Bogachyov), were charged with the assassination of Yandarbiyev, assassination attempt of his son Daud and smuggling weapons into Qatar. According to Russia, Yablochkov and Pugachyov were secret intelligence agents sent to the Russian Embassy in Doha to collect information about global terrorism. Russia‚Äôs acting Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov pledged state support to the suspects and declared that their imprisonment was illegal.Sergei Ivanov has promised to strive for discharge of the Russian prisoners in Qatar.

The trial proceedings were closed to the public after the defendants claimed that one of the prosecution witnesses, the Qatari Colonel Dawi or Dawdi, had tortured them in the first days after their arrest, when they had been held incommunicado; the two Russians alleged that they had suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and attacks by guard dogs. Based on these torture allegations and the fact that the two officers were arrested within an extraterritorial compound belonging to the Russian Embassy (i.e. effectively on Russian soil), Russia demanded the immediate release of its citizens; they were represented by the attorney of the law firm founded by Nikolai Yegorov, a friend and fellow student of Vladimir Putin at Leningrad State University.The Origin of Putin's Oligarchy by Vladimir Pribylovsky, Ms., October 11, 2005 (in Russian).

Other technologies such as Cable, FTTH and FTTB (fiber), Satellite, UMTS/HSDPA (mobile) and LTE are available as alternatives. DSL In Germany, DSL is the prevalent internet access technology with over 30 million subscribers. For residential services the Annex B versions of ADSL, ADSL2+, and VDSL2 are used. With over 12 million customers the incumbent Deutsche Telekom is the market leader. Other DSL providers either operate their own hardware on local loops rented from the incumbent in a local loop unbundling (LLU) arrangement, and/or purchase bit- stream access from a provider that operates DSL hardware. As of January 2014, a typical monthly cost for \\"dual flatrate\\" internet and telephone service start at ‚Ç¨25 for ADSL2+ (16 Mbit/s downlink, 1 Mbit/s uplink) and ‚Ç¨30 for VDSL2 (50 Mbit/s downlink, 10 Mbit/s uplink). Some of the major nationwide DSL providers are: * Deutsche Telekom  Congstar * 1&1 * Vodafone * o2 * Versatel Providers such as Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone also offer DSL-based triple play services with IPTV, which requires at least 16 Mbit/s for HD quality. Starting in 2013, all newly deployed Deutsche Telekom VDSL2 nodes support G.vector technology. Beginning in August 2014, vectored VDSL2 service with data rates of up to 100 Mbit/s downlink and 40 Mbit/s uplink is available from Deutsche Telekom. Existing VDSL2 deployments in major cities will be upgraded to G.vector in 2016. Deutsche Telekom is planning to introduce 500 Mbit/s service using G.fast in 2017 at the earliest. Symmetric DSL (SDSL) connections using G.shdsl technology are marketed to business customers. Providers offering SDSL include Deutsche Telekom, QSC, and Versatel. Alternative technologies While DSL is the prevalent connection technology in Germany, other technologies may offer lower prices or better availability and speed. =Cable= Internet via cable is offered by Kabel Deutschland and Unitymedia (separated geographically). Additionally there are some small providers as well which do not operate nationwide. The typical available download speed is between 10 and 200 Mbit/s. In April 2015 Tele Columbus started offering up to 400 Mbit/s. A typical 2-year subscription with 120Mbit/s internet and telephone costs about ‚Ç¨35 per month, with additional HD cable TV about ‚Ç¨60. Since November 2014 both Unitymedia and Kabel Deutschland offer connections with up to 200Mbit/s in downstream. Unitymedia started its 400 MBit/s connections in January 2016, Vodafone Kabel Deutschland offers 400 MBit/s since June 2016. =FTTH and FTTB= Deutsche Telekom started offering FTTH/FTTB in select regions in 2011, with up to 200 Mbit/s downstream and 100 Mbit/s upstream. As of January 2014, Deutsche Telekom FTTH was available in 884,000 households, at a price point of ‚Ç¨55 for 100/50 Mbit/s and ‚Ç¨60 for 200/100 Mbit/s service. Regional providers also offer FTTH/FTTB services, e.g. M-Net in Munich, wilhelm.tel in Hamburg, NetCologne in Cologne, and in Aachen. =Satellite= Satellite internet is geographically more widely available than land-based technologies. In places where land-based internet access technology (DSL, cable, FTTx) is not available, satellite and UMTS/LTE are the primary means of high-speed internet access. As opposed to UMTS/LTE, satellite internet providers offer flatrates. =UMTS/HSDPA and LTE= Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone offer fixed location internet service on their UMTS and LTE networks. As of December 2014, there are no flatrates available. The included data volume is generally higher for fixed location service than for mobile service at the same price point. As of December 2014, both Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone limit the speed to 384 kbit/s after the data volume of between 10 and 30 GB is used up. UMTS/HSDPA with up to 42.2 Mbit/s and LTE with up to 375 Mbit/s is offered by all four network operators: Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, o2, and E-Plus. In 2013, Chip measured average downstream UMTS/GPRS data rates of between 2.4 and 7.9 Mbit/s and average downstream LTE/UMTS/GPRS data rates of between 3.2 and 16.0 Mbit/s, depending on both provider and location (rural vs. city). In the same test, LTE coverage was measured at between 15% and 80%, depending on provider and location (rural vs. city). A typical 2-year contract with 2GB of LTE speed, unlimited minutes and texts costs around ‚Ç¨40 per month. History The first email from the US to Germany was sent in 1984. Until 1995, Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) was a government corporation linked with Deutsche Bundespost. As a government run and owned corporation, Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly ISP until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. Until the 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses. Bildschirmtext (BTX) was an early data network service offered by Deutsche Telekom starting in 1983. Later it served as an alternative to the Internet, but was discontinued by 2001.:de:Bildschirmtext =DSL= Prior to the introduction of DSL and cable internet, voice-band modems and ISDN BRI were the most common residential internet access technologies. ISDN was widespread, with 333 ISDN BRIs per 1000 persons in 2005. DSL was introduced in Germany by Deutsche Telekom on July 1, 1999 under the brand name T-DSL, with 768 kbit/s downstream and 128 kbit/s upstream.:de:DSL (Telekom) T-DSL speeds were increased by Deutsche Telekom to 1536/192 kbit/s upstream/downstream in September 2002, 3072/384 kbit/s in April 2004, and 6016/576 kbit/s in mid-2005. Deutsche Telekom introduced ADSL2+ service with 16000/1024 kbit/s in spring 2006 and VDSL2 with 50000/10000 kbit/s triple play service under the brand name Entertain in October 2006.:de:Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line#VDSL2 in Deutschland VDSL2 service without bundled IPTV was introduced in June 2009. In 2011, Deutsche Telekom introduced Voice over IP (VoIP) services over ADSL2+ Annex J. In February 2013, Deutsche Telekom started switching existing POTS and ISDN voice service subscribers to VoIP service. In August 2014, Deutsche Telekom became the first service provider to offer vectored VDSL2 using G.vector technology, offering 100/40 Mbit/s. In 1998, the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) established regulations for local loop unbundling, enabling providers such as Vodafone, Telef√≥nica Germany (O2), QSC, and Versatel to rent the local loop from the incumbent Deutsche Telekom and to operate their own access networks, placing their DSLAMs either in their own central offices (CO) or co- located with the incumbent's.:de:Entb√ºndelung These ISPs either offered their services directly to the subscriber, or sold bit-stream access to other ISPs.:de:Bitstromzugang To compete with the incumbent's POTS and ISDN voice services, alternative providers introduced voice over IP (VoIP) bundled with their DSL internet services under the name Komplettanschluss. Starting in 2004, Deutsche Telekom provided IP-level bitstream access to other providers under the name T-DSL resale.:de:T-DSL-Resale The \\"resold\\" T-DSL was only available to subscribers of Deutsche Telekom's POTS/ISDN service.:de:T-DSL- Resale In July 2008, Deutsche Telekom introduced bitstream access which does not require the incumbent's POTS/ISDN service, enabling competing ISPs to provide combined internet and VoIP service (Komplettanschluss) on Deutsche Telekom-operated local loops. G.vector is not compatible with local loop unbundling, because G.vector can only be feasibly deployed by one provider per serving area interface. The regulator BNetzA conceived a \\"vectoring list\\", on which providers can claim cabinets on a first-come-first-served basis. To prevent a monopoly, this provider is required to offer bit-stream access to its competitors. =Cable= Cable internet access in Germany began with pilot projects in December 2003 and wide deployment followed in late 2004.:de:Kabel Deutschland#Geschichte A number of political reasons prevented an earlier market adoption of cable internet in Germany.:de:Netzebene (Kabelfernsehen)#Betreiber und neuere Entwicklung Until 2001, Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly owner of the German coax cable network, and had no intention to offer in-house competition to its DSL service. Pressure from regulatory agencies forced Deutsche Telekom to sell its cable network, however Deutsche Telekom took measures to delay a possible cable internet offering. =LTE= LTE internet access was introduced by Deutsche Telekom in 2010 and by Vodafone in 2011.:de:Digitale Dividende As part of the 2010 spectrum auction, the regulatory agency BNetzA required bidders to use the spectrum to provide broadband internet access to regions with only limited land-line broadband (DSL, cable, FTTH) access. For the purpose of land-line broadband replacement, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone introduced fixed location LTE service. Internet censorship and surveillance Internet censorship in Germany is practiced by law as well as the effect of some court decisions. An example of content censored by law is the removal of web sites from Google search results that deny the holocaust, which is a felony under German law. Most cases of Internet censorship in Germany, however, occur after state court rulings. One example is a 2009 court order, forbidding German Wikipedia to disclose the identity of Wolfgang Werl√© and Manfred Lauber, two criminals convicted of the murder of the Bavarian actor Walter Sedlmayr. In another case, Wikipedia.de (an Internet domain run by Wikimedia Deutschland) was prohibited from pointing to the actual Wikipedia content. The court order was as a temporary injunction in a case filed by politician Lutz Heilmann over claims in a German Wikipedia article regarding his past involvement with the former German Democratic Republic's intelligence service Stasi.

Some of his smaller works, such as The Galatea and the small copy of Raphael's School of Athens (1819), in the Galleria Tosio Martinengo at Brescia, give a more favorable idea of his talent. He painted one of the lunettes in the Tribune of Galileo at the Natural History Museum (La Specola Museum) in Florence, and the more important series of scenes from the life of Caesar (1836) in one of the rooms on the ground floor of the Pitti Palace. His Assumption of the Virgin is found in the Museo dell'Opera of the church of Santa Croce. Other principal works include a Baptism of Clovis and a Madonna in fresco for the Pitti Palace. He painted two ceilings for the Borghese Palace at Rome representing Toilet of Venus, and Venus carrying Ascanius. He died in Florence.

As an international, Hayes played for both Ireland teams ‚Äì the FAI XI and the IFA XI. Like fellow dual international, Billy Walsh, he also represented England Schoolboys. Greatest Ever Cork Team Another William Hayes also played for Ireland during the 1940s. Club career =Huddersfield Town= Hayes moved to England as a youth and played junior football in the Sheffield area before being spotted by Huddersfield Town as a teenager. In two spells with Town, either side of the Second World War, he made 184 league appearances and scored 5 league goals. He also made 21 wartime league appearances for the club during the 1939‚Äì40 season. Soccer at War ‚Äì 1939 ‚Äì 45 (2005): Jack Rollin Hayes won all six of his senior international caps while playing for Town. =Cork United= During the Second World War, Hayes returned to Cork where he played for a very successful Cork United team. His United teammates included, among others, Jack O'Reilly, Florrie Burke, Owen Madden, Jackie O'Driscoll, Frank O'Farrell and Tommy Moroney. Hayes helped United win five League of Ireland titles and in 1942 they won an FAI Cup / League double. While with the club he also represented the League of Ireland XI on two occasions. History of soccer in Cork =Burnley F.C.= In February 1950 Hayes left Huddersfield Town and signed for Burnley. He made his debut for Burnley on 18 February 1950 in a home game against Chelsea. He played his final game for the club on 20 January 1951 against Newcastle United. After making just 12 league appearances he was released in May 1952. Irish international When Hayes began his international career in 1937 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland ‚Äì based IFA and the Irish Free State ‚Äì based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including Hayes, played for both teams. =IFA XI= In 1937 and 1938 Hayes made 4 appearances for the IFA XI. He made his international debut on 23 October 1937 in a 5‚Äì1 defeat against England. He then helped the IFA XI earn a 1‚Äì1 draw with Scotland on 10 November 1937. He played again against Scotland in 1938 before making his final appearance for the IFA XI in a 7‚Äì0 defeat against England on 16 November 1938. =FAI XI= In 1938 Hayes missed out on two opportunities to play for the FAI XI. He was initially called up to play against Switzerland on 18 September. However Huddersfield Town were unable to release him as they not only had a game the day before but also the day after. He was then called up again to play against Poland on 13 November. However this time Hayes found himself in the same predicament as Tommy Breen had a year earlier. He had also been called up by the IFA to play against England on 16 November and, like Breen, he chose to withdraw from the FAI selection. Hayes eventually made 2 appearances for the FAI XI in 1946 and 1947. On 30 September 1946 he was a member of the first ever FAI XI to play against England. Hayes was injured during the game and was reduced to the role of a limping passenger. Despite a credible performance, the FAI XI lost 1‚Äì0. He made his second and last appearance for the FAI XI on 4 May 1947 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat against Portugal. During this game Hayes missed a penalty, shooting yards wide just after half-time.

The first moves to providing an electricity supply to Geelong were made in 1898, with three separate companies vying for the right to operate in the city. Two of these companies merged to form the Electric Lighting and Traction Company of Australia, who built the Geelong A power station. The company was later taken over by the Melbourne Electric Supply Company, who remained the supplier of electricity to Geelong until 1 September 1930, when the company was purchased by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. In 1936 Geelong was connected to the state electrical grid, and by the 1960s Geelong A had closed. Geelong B remained for a few more years being used for peak loads only, but closed in 1970 due to the much higher efficiency of the new power stations in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. Geelong A Facade of the former Geelong A power station, now part of Westfield Bay City The Geelong A power station was located on the corner of Yarra and Brougham Streets in the city., ...photographic collection of glass plate and film negatives...relating to the development of the electric power supply industry in Victoria,...and various predecessor private and municipal power supply enterprises dating back to the late 1880s. Geelong 'A' Power Station... It was erected by the Electric Lighting and Traction Company of Australia, who laid the foundation stone in March 1900. On 4 June 1900 the first power pole was erected in Geelong, on the corner of McKillop and Yarra Streets opposite the Jewish Synagogue. The work was completed by May 1901, and on 3 May a ceremony was held to switch on the supply of electricity to Geelong. =Design= The power station was originally of 200 kilowatts capacity, and supplied electricity at 440/220 volts DC current. Equipment at the station consisted of: * two 100 kW Belliss- Brush steam dynamos * two boilers of dry back return tube type, operating at 120 psi steam pressure, with Green's economisers also fitted * high brick chimney * 800 ampere hour secondary battery for lamps in the station. Condensing water for the boilers was pumped from Corio Bay by electric pump via a cast iron rising main. The power station was only used in daylight hours, with the town run by batteries at night. In 1920 the original equipment was scrapped, and a three phase 6000 volt 50 cycle system was installed, giving a total generation capacity of 10,500 kilowatts (10.5 MW). The new works included: * six John Thompson water tube boilers, with a of heating surface, and 200 psi gauge pressure * four Erith-Riley multiple retort stokers, and two Underfeed company chain grate stokers set up in batteries of two * one 1,500 kW Brush-Ljungstrom turbo-alternator, and three further sets of Metropolitan-Vickers 3000 kW alternators. * an additional floor to the administration block * new water tunnel to Corio Bay tunnelled Three Peebles- La-Cour rotary converters of 500 kilowatt capacity was also installed to supply DC current for the Geelong tramways and older DC city supplies. The fuel used was Black coal from Newcastle that was brought from fuel storage yards some distance away. The station was converted to burn brown coal briquettes in 1931, with the stokers to the boiler replaced by locally produced ones of overfeed design. The use of black coal was phased out by 1937. After 1930 the station was transferred to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, and was operated with one generator set out of service, giving a useful capacity of 7500 kilowatts, and an overload capacity of 9375 kilowatts. The Geelong Harbour Trust had also been responsible for the supply of electricity to the port of Geelong, with these responsibilities acquired by the SECV from midnight 13 June 1938. =Closure= The rotary converters ceased functioning on 17 July 1961, resulting in the DC current supply being terminated. This also marked the end of 'Geelong A' as a generating unit. However, the plant was retained until 1967, with the sale of equipment being carried out in 1966‚Äì67, and dismantling and removal planned to take 7 to 8 months. Sale of the building was dependent on the SECV Distribution Depot being moved to North Geelong, the conversion of older 6.6 kV feeders to a more modern 22 kV system, and the removal of the 6.6 kV switching structure and capacitor banks at old station. The building was sold at auction on 11 June 1970 for $45,000 to a Mr I. Watson acting on behalf of unknown company. Development plans were floated for the site throughout the 1980s, but it was not until Bay City Plaza shopping centre was built that anything was done. The facade of the administration block remains as part of the shopping centre today. Geelong B Geelong B power station from the west, looking over Corio Bay Geelong B power station in 2011 The Geelong B power station was of 30,000 kilowatt (30 MW) capacity and located at North Geelong on the edge of Corio Bay. It was also the largest power station in Victoria outside the Latrobe Valley. The plant was officially opened on 8 October 1954 by the Honourable J.W. Galbally, MLC, Minister in Charge of Electrical Undertakings. Geelong B was a 'packaged' station from components imported from the United States of America and was erected under contract for the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. The contract included the supply and erection of buildings, boilers, generators, transformers, switchgear and coal handling equipment, and putting the station into service. The power station was of unusual design, with no conventional boiler house, the boilers being out of doors except for the boiler operating face, which helped to reduce building costs. Each of the three boilers was connected to a generator of 10,000 kW capacity. Cooling water for the power station was drawn from Corio Bay, and most of the power generated was used by local industry. The boilers were automatically controlled, and produced 110,000 pounds of steam per hour (49,900 kg/h) at 625 psi (4.3 MPa). Fuel was moved by belt bucket and scraper conveyors to the fuel bunkers, then delivered to the boilers by mechanical spreader stokers. The fuel used was brown coal purchased by the SECV from the Wensley Brae open cut mine, just west of Wensleydale, but from 1960 better quality coal was purchased from a mine at Anglesea instead. (The Anglesea mine was then used to fuel the adjacent Anglesea Power Station that opened in 1969 and closed in 2015.) A third change in fuel supplied occurred soon after, with the boilers being converted to use briquettes brought to Geelong by rail from Yallourn. By the 1960s the power station was only used to meet peak loads due to its high operating cost, and the station was closed in 1970 when newer power stations were opened in the Latrobe Valley. The building known as the Powerhouse still stands today and in 2014 was the site of an arts project curated by Ian Ballis that decorated the once derelict building with many of pieces of art. It was opened to the public at the time. Rone was one artist who participated. References * R. Arklay and I.

On the contrary, the average of mobile connections is above the global average (Global: 28.02 Mbit/s Down and 10.87 Mbit/s Up - Italy: 31.31 Mbit/s Down and 12.74 Mbit/s Up at August 2019). Overview According to data released by the fibre-to-the- home (FTTH) Council Europe, Italy represents one of the largest FTTH markets in Europe, with more than 2.5 million homes passed by fibre at end-December 2010;Will Italy have the best FTTH network in Europe? FTTH Council Europe. Web. 02 Dec. 2012. at the same date the country reported around 348,000 fibre subscribers. The \\"Fibre for Italy\\" project (with the participation of providers Fastweb, Vodafone and Wind in a co-investment partnership) aims to reach 20 million people in Italy's 15 largest cities by 2015, and Telecom Italia plans to connect 138 cities by 2018. The government has also started the Italia Digitale project, which aims to provide at least 50% of Italians with high-speed internet access by 2020. The government aims to extend the fibre-optic network to rural areas. While ADSL2+ with speeds up to 20/1 Mbit/s is still the most widely common subscription available in Italy, the main telephone company in the country (TIM or Telecom Italia) is investing 12 billion ‚Ç¨ in the period of 2016-2018, with the aim of reaching 84% of the homes with broadband connection (100 Mbit/s) before the end of 2018. Despite this, there's a debate going because the company is still investing on copper and on the fiber-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) technology, instead of bringing fibre directly to the home everywhere. The FTTC and VDSL2 technologies can currently bring up to 100/20 Mbit/s connections to the final customer. TIM and Fastweb have plans to increase FTTC speeds with vectoring to up to 200/50 Mbit/s streams before the end of 2016. The FTTH network is developing as well, with a standard 1000/100 Mbit/s connection (1000/200 Mbit/s with Vodafone ) at the same subscription price as FTTC . Figures published by the National Institute of Statistics showed at end-2011 that 58,8% of Italian families had a personal computer (up slightly from 57,6% in 2010); Cittadini e nuove tecnologie. Istituto nazionale di statistica. Web. 01 Dec. 2012. 54,5% had access to the internet (up from 52,4%); and 45,8% had broadband access (up from 43,4%). Over one-fourth (26,3%, down slightly from 26,4% in 2010) of Italian internet users aged 14 and older made an online purchase during 2011. Internet regulation A sign posted on the door of an internet cafe in Florence regarding Italian Law No. 155 of 31 July 2005 An anti-terrorism law amended in 2005, after the terrorists attacks in Madrid and London, by then-Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Pisanu, restricted the opening of new Wi-Fi Hotspots, subjecting interested entities to first apply for permission to open at the Police Headquarters of jurisdiction and that such hotspot's customers were be subjected to identification, by presenting an identity document. This inhibited the opening of hotspots across Italy, with a number of hotspots 5 times lower than France and the conspicuous absence of Municipal wireless networks. Considering the above-mentioned law was too strict, a proposed law was proposed to facilitate the opening and access of Wi-Fi Hotspots, although it was not clear how it should have been possible. Only at the end of 2010, a bipartisan bill allowed for the repeal of article 7 of the Pisanu law.Decreto Pisanu, pronto il cestino?

He played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1976 and 1985, for the Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros, and Chicago Cubs, primarily as an outfielder.  Early life and education  Woods graduated from San Marcos High School in 1971 and then attended Santa Barbara City College before starting his professional baseball career. After a 14-year professional career Woods returned to his studies where he earned an MBA at Pepperdine University.GoletaValleyVoice.com  Baseball career  = Oakland A's = On May 12, 1973, the Oakland Athletics signed Woods as a nondrafted free agent. He spent 1973 playing outfield for the A's Class A minor league Lewiston Broncs, and in 1974 for the Class A Burlington Bees. In 1975, he was promoted to the Double-A Birmingham A's in the Southern League, and in 1976, Woods advanced to the Triple-A Tucson Toros. On September 14, 1976, Woods made his major league debut in the second game of a doubleheader, a 4‚Äì3 loss to the Minnesota Twins. Woods entered the game as a defensive replacement, playing center field. He got a base hit in his only at bat in the top of the 9th inning. In six games for the A's in 1976, he went 1 for 8. = Toronto Blue Jays = On November 5, 1976, Woods was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He was in the Blue Jays' opening day lineup for the debut game on April 7, 1977, batting fifth. \\"I remember the snow on the field and I remember Doug Ault and I remember the excitement in the city,\\" Woods told the Toronto Star in an article that was published on October 8, 1985. \\"I was a young ballplayer very excited to be part of a building experience. It was a really neat feeling. But of course we played like an expansion team and I played like a guy who wasn't quite ready for the major leagues.\\" Woods was sent out to Triple-A during the 1977 season as he struggled with the bat, and was later brought back to Toronto to get some more playing time. 1978 was a different story as Woods did not make the team in the spring, spent the full Triple-A season in the minors, finally getting a call up when the Major League rosters expanded in September. By then he was no longer in the Jays' plans. = Houston Astros = On December 5, 1978, Woods was traded to the Houston Astros for minor league outfielder Don Pisker. Woods spent 1979 and most of 1980 in the minors, playing again for the Triple-A Tucson Toros, which by this point had shifted affiliations from Oakland to Houston. In late 1980, Woods was called up to the majors, hitting .377 in 19 games. Woods also went 2-for-8 in four games in the Astros' League Championship Series in 1980. In the strike-shortened 1981 season, Woods platooned with Terry Puhl in the outfield, helping the Astros reach the West Division playoffs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \\"I really felt I was a big part of them getting there,\\" he told the Chicago Tribune in an article that was published on September 11, 1986, referring to the playoffs. \\"Of course, I may have also played a big part in them not getting to the World Series when I left third base too soon in one of the games.\\" = Chicago Cubs = On December 9, 1981, Woods was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Jim Tracy and was pressed into service as a starting center fielder when prospect Ty Waller failed early. \\"I was batting about .350 after 150 at-bats,\\" Woods told the Chicago Tribune in the September 11, 1986 article. \\"But they decided to put Keith (Moreland) in the outfield and they wanted to play Steve Henderson to see if they could trade him. I sat down and never got a chance to get back in.\\" Woods finished the 1982 hitting .269 in 117 games and never committing an error. Woods played for the Cubs in limited amounts in the 1983, 1984 and 1985 seasons. One highlight was getting to play in the 1984 National League Championship Series against the San Diego Padres. In one game, Woods went 0-for-1 and played outfield. Woods tried to continue his career in 1986 after being cut by the Cubs in spring training despite hitting .286. At that point, Padres then-minor league manager Larry Bowa asked the Padres to sign Woods to a minor league contract, and Woods played a full season at the Padres AAA Las Vegas minor league club before retiring. \\"I have no regrets,\\" Woods told the Chicago Tribune in the September 11, 1986 article. \\"There are a whole lot of guys with more talent than I ever had who never got the opportunity. I went to the big leagues, went down, made it back and stayed for six years. I know I can look in the mirror and say I did all I could to be the best possible player I could be.\\"  Life after baseball  When his playing career ended, Woods entered the business world and coached at a youth level. He had returned to professional baseball and was a Southern California area scout for the Chicago White Sox, also serving as hitting coach during the summer for the Santa Barbara Foresters, one of the top teams in the California Collegiate League. Woods died from a heart attack on February 19, 2015, in Solvang, California. Woods was living in the Santa Ynez Valley at the time of his death.

The St. Malo Declaration laid the political foundation between France and the United Kingdom, which in turn facilitated the launch of the European Security and Defence Policy and the formulation of the Headline Goal. In 2004, a new target was set: the \\"Headline Goal 2010\\". To update the initial declaration in December 1999, the formal agreement on the Headline Goal was reached on 22 November 2004 and according to statements made by EU officials the first units will be deployable in 2007. Since 1 January 2007, 60,000 soldiers have been available for a possible European Rapid Reaction Force who are potentially able to be deployed for at least a year. Headline Goal 2003 Under this plan, the European Union pledged itself during the Helsinki summit to be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg tasks (as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty), including the most demanding, in operations up to corps level (up to 15 brigades or 50,000-60,000 persons) to be capable of intervening in any crisis that could occur in an area where European interests are affected.WEU, European strategic lift capabilities - reply to the annual report of the Council, 5 December 2001, The aim was to make those forces self-reliant, able to deploy within 60 days and over , and sustainable in the field for a year. This means the force would actually have to number around 180,000 troops so as to provide rotating replacements for the initial forces. The Petersberg tasks include humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks; and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.EUROPEAN UNION, Petersberg tasks, n.d. EU- led forces assembled in response to a crisis would last only for the duration of the crisis and it would be up to the member states themselves to decide whether, when and how to contribute troops. The Petersberg tasks, which outline the duties of the ERRF, have been expanded from humanitarian, rescue, and peacekeeping and peacemaking to include 'joint disarmament operation', 'military advice and assistance tasks' and 'post-conflict stabilisation'. It also states that, \\"all these tasks may contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating terrorism in their territories.\\"EUISS: redirection from old site =Headline Force Catalogue= From the Petersberg task scenarios envisaged, the EU Military Staff generated the \\"Helsinki Headline Catalogue\\" which specifies which capabilities are required in each of 144 capability areas. In November 2000, the European Union held a Capabilities Commitment Conference in Brussels, which elicited commitments for over 100,000 (existing) troops that were declared available for what became known as the Helsinki Force Catalogue. A year later, a Capabilities Improvement Conference was held during which further military forces and 5,000 police were added to the catalogue. =European Capability Action Plan= During the December 2001 Laeken summit, the EU launched the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP) to remedy European capability shortfalls.WEU, ESDP developments and the Headline Goal 2010 ‚àí reply to the annual report of the Council, 15 June 2005, It involved initially some 20 panels composed of military experts from the member states which put forward plans and proposals to fill the identified shortfalls (e.g., by acquiring new equipment or optimising existing capabilities, in particular through cooperation at European level). Headline Goal 2010 As the Helsinki Headline Goal became fulfilled, the European Council of June 2004 approved to further develop the EU's military crisis management capability and a new target was set: the \\"Headline Goal 2010\\".CONSOLIUM EUROPEAN UNION, HEADLINE GOAL 2010 EU members made the commitment that by the year 2010, at the latest, they would be capable of responding \\"with swift and decisive action applying a fully coherent approach\\" to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty of the EU and the 2003 EU Security Strategy (i.e. humanitarian and rescue tasks, disarmament operations, support to third countries in combating terrorism, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, and peacemaking). The EU also aims to address the shortfalls from the previous headline goal (e.g. gaps related to strategic airlift and sealift) which are still considered to be a limiting factor to the operability of the designated forces, especially in more demanding crisis management operations.

Completed in early 1944, the ship spent the war in the Baltic Sea, escorting German ships, laying minefields, and bombarding Soviet forces. On 12 December, a navigational error caused her to enter a German minefield as she was preparing to lay another minefield in the Gulf of Finland off the Estonian coast. Z36 struck a single mine and sank with the loss of all hands. The wreck was surveyed in 1994. Design and description The Type 1936B design retained the hull design of the Type 1936A, but reverted to the lighter main armament of the Type 1936 to reduce topweight and improve seakeeping. The ships had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers for a designed speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Their crew consisted of 11‚Äì15 officers and 305‚Äì20 sailors. The Type 1936B ships carried five SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on top of the rear deckhouse. The guns were designated No. 1 to 5 from front to rear. Their anti-aircraft armament consisted of four SK C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and fifteen C/38 guns in three quadruple and three single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two power- operated mounts. Two reloads were provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 74‚Äì76 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchger√§t) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines and a S-Ger√§t sonar was also probably fitted. The ships were equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge. Construction and career Z36 was originally ordered as a Type 1938B destroyer from AG Weser (Deschimag) on 28 June 1939, but the contract was cancelled when the Type 1938B design was abandoned, and the ship was reordered as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer. That was changed to a Type 1936B on 17 February 1941. She was laid down as yard number W1006 on 15 September at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard, launched on 15 May 1943 and commissioned on 19 February 1944, under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (Lieutenant Commander) Fredric von Hausen. After working up Z36 was assigned to the 6. Zerst√∂rerflotille (6th Destroyer Flotilla) in mid-1944. In preparation for Operation Tanne West, the occupation of the √Öland Islands in case of Finnish surrender, the flotilla escorted the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow to the island of Ut√∂ on 28 June, but the operation was canceled and the ships returned to port. On 30 July and 1 August Z36 and three other destroyers of the flotilla sailed into the Gulf of Riga to bombard Soviet positions inland. On 5 August, they escorted the heavy cruiser as she engaged targets on the island of √ñsel, Estonia, and in Latvia on 19‚Äì20 August. Z36 and the destroyer escorted the troopship MV Monte Rosa, laden with refugees, from Baltischport, Estonia, to Gotenhafen, Germany, on 16 September. That month, the flotilla also covered the convoys evacuating Finland and then Reval. From 10 to 15 October the flotilla escorted L√ºtzow and Prinz Eugen as they resumed their shore bombardment missions and bombarded targets themselves, attacking Soviet positions at Memel and Libau. The following month, the flotilla and the heavy cruisers and Prinz Eugen shelled Soviet positions during the evacuation of Sworbe, on √ñsel, between 20 and 24 November. In mid-December, the 6. Zerst√∂rerflotille, which now consisted of Z36, her sister ships and , and the large torpedo boats and , was tasked to lay a new minefield between the Estonian coast and an existing minefield slightly further out to sea. T23 was to escort the other ships and the destroyers were laden with 68 mines each. The mission was postponed to the night of 11/12 December because of bad weather and the flotilla sailed on the morning of the 11th. The weather gradually worsened over the course of the day and the spray and rain made navigation difficult. Having sailed a bit too far north, Z35 and Z36 blundered into the Nashorn (Rhinoceros) minefield that was only north of the intended position of the new minefield. Around 02:00, Z36 struck a mine and sank very quickly with the loss of all hands. The wreck was surveyed by the Finnish Ministry of the Environment in 1994 at .

ADSL bandwidth is received mainly through the Seabone Network, Interoute and Telecom Italia, operated by GO Plc and Vodafone Malta Ltd, whilst there is another connection operated by Melita Plc The bandwidth is then sold to the various ISPs which in turn sell it to customers. December 2005, DataStream merged with the ISP Maltanet, giving Maltanet a competitive edge over other ISPs. Both DataStream and Maltanet were subsidiaries of Maltacom, the national telephone company, which is now integrated into one company called GO. Cable Internet is offered by only one ISP, Melita Plc. Melita - Internet (formerly branded as OnVol) is a division of the cable and digital television provider, Melita Plc. Melita - Internet also offer standard ADSL connections for businesses. In Q3 2007 Vodafone launched a fixed WiMAX based offering for Internet access. This increased the competition in Malta. However, since Q2/Q3 of 2011, this has been discontinued due to unsatisfactory results with the reliability of the WiMAX system, and is no longer offered to new customers. As of 2019, Vodafone began offering home broadband packages, although these use GO's fibre network as a base. In 2010 Melita launched a service at 100Mbit/s, then the fastest in Malta. Melita also held the highest upload speed at the time with 4Mbit/s, which has today been matched mainly thanks to advances in telephone copper delivered internet through new technologies such as vDSL. Since 2016, GO has been installing fibre-optic cabling across Malta; as of 2019, more than 100,000 homes (approximately 50% of Malta and Gozo) were included in the network, with full nationwide coverage expected by 2024.https://www.go.com.mt/true-fibre/  References ","title":"Internet in Malta"},{"id":"12837820","text":"Gaspare Landi (6 January 1756 ‚Äì 28 February 1830) was an Italian painter of the Neoclassic period, active in Rome and his native city of Piacenza. Self- portrait Gaspare Landi, Veturia at the Feet of Coriolanus, Palazzo Pitti Biography He is said to have been a fun-loving youth, but in 1781 he procured a subsidy to study painting in Rome from patron and distant relative, Marquis Giambattista Landi. At age 25, he moved to Rome to work under Domenico Corvi and Pompeo Battoni. He is considered a rival of Vincenzo Camuccini. Two of his pictures were once in the Pinacoteca at Parma, Diomedes and Ulysses bearing off the Palladium (1783) and the Marriage of Abraham and Sarah. Above one of the altars in the church of the Santa Casa at Loreto there is a later work by this Landi showing the Madonna addolorata. A major work is his large canvas representing the fainting of Christ as he struggles along over the road to Calvary weighted down by the burden of the Cross, Lo Spasimo for San Giovanni in Canale at Piacenza.Gli artisti piacentini, cronaca ragionata By Luigi Ambiveri Tipografia Francesco Solari, Piacenza, 1879. page 175. It hung opposite Vincenzo Camuccini's Presentation. He painted a Deposition of the Virgin in the Tomb and Apostles at the empty Tomb of the Virgin (1804) for the choir of the Duomo of PiacenzaL. Ambiveri, page 174-175. Landi became a member of the Accademia di San Luca of Rome in 1805, professor of the theory of painting in 1812, and president of the Academy in 1817. He was also made a Chevalier of the Order of the Iron Crown by the Emperor, of the Order of San Giuseppe, and of a Neapolitan order by the King of Naples. L. Ambiveri, page 186-188. About 1820 he returned to Piacenza, intending to remain there, but soon tired of the monotonous existence of a provincial town, and in 1824 reestablished himself at Rome. His last work was an Assumption and was placed in the church of San Francesco di Paola in Naples. He was offered a post as professor of the Academy of Venice, but stayed instead a president of the Academy of St Luke in Rome.L. Ambiveri, page 186-191.

Hickory golf is a variation of golf played with hickory shafted golf clubs. In the United States the main organizing bodies are The Society of Hickory Golfers (SoHG) and the Golf Collectors Society; in Canada - The Canadian Golf Historical Society; and in the UK - The British Golf Collectors Society. There are also active groups in Switzerland, Sweden and Finland that conduct national tournaments. Part of the attraction of playing with hickory clubs is that they reintroduce 'feel' to the golf shot. Proponents also claim that hickory golf allows golfers to play classic golf courses as they are meant to be played. Divisions There are two main divisions of play, pre-1935 and pre-1900. The pre-1900 group play a Gutta- Percha style ball, and clubs are limited to those produced before 1900 or approved reproductions. Iron clubs are smooth-faced and woods are splice- necked. The main tournament for this group is the National Hickory Championship organized by Peter Georgiady. In June of 2019 it will conduct its 22nd Championship at the historic Mound Golf Course in Miamisburg, OH. The majority of the \\"NHC\\" tournaments have been conducted in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia at Oakhurst Links, as restored by Lewis Keller, and identified by the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest golf course in the United States. The two other venues have been Pinehurst No.8 & No.1 (one Championship) and The St. Martin's course of The Philadelphia Cricket Club (two Championships). The pre-1935 group (vintage division) play with modern balls, but play is limited to clubs manufactured before 1935 or to authorized reproductions. There are numerous tournaments and championships. Championships There are a number of Championships conducted in countries around the world. The majority of the events are currently held in the United States and the United Kingdom. Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, France and Finland have held events. Schedules of these events are available at Hickorygolf.com and the SoHG (hickorygolfers.com). The French hickory golf Championship (francehickory.com) of La Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Golf Hickory is the leading tournament of Continental Europe and since 2009 involves Professional Golfers. The inaugural Championship during Centennial of Chantilly G.C. was remarked by never seen scores under PAR. It is the first prize money Championship of Continental Europe. The Swiss Hickory Championship Days (swisshickory.ch) were inaugurated in 2011. They are held on the oldest golf course in Switzerland, the Engadine Golf Club - Since 1893 in St. Moritz/Samedan. Amateurs and Professionals are welcomed to participate in this hickory event. Probably the most prestigious tournament is The World Hickory Open Championship (www.worldhickoryopen.com), which was inaugurated in 2004 and played on Musselburgh Old Course, the oldest still surviving playing surface in the world (Guinness Book of Records). This year (2010) the tournament continues as part of the Festival of Hickory Golf, played on some of Scotland's best known East Lothian golf courses including Musselburgh Old Course, Craigielaw, Gullane 2 and 3, and Archerfield. The Royal Musselburgh Golf Club host the Scottish Hickory Open Championship. At this event any player is eligible to participate as Hickory Clubs are available on the day which makes the event available to all golfers of all abilities.

The smelter has a production capacity of 545,000 tonnes of aluminium per year. The operating company Boyne Smelters Ltd is 59.4% owned by Rio Tinto Alcan with the balance held by a consortium of Japanese participants including Sumitomo, Marubeni, Mitsubishi and YKK Group. 2011 saw the construction of a new carbon bake furnace to replace the original bake furnace. History Construction of the smelter commenced in 1979 and the plant was officially opened in 1982. The concept of an aluminium industry in the state of Queensland, Australia began in 1957 when the Queensland Government and Comalco's predecessor signed an agreement giving the company the right to develop a large bauxite deposit discovered two years earlier at Weipa on the remote far North West coast of Cape York Peninsula by the company. The agreement required Comalco to accept a number of obligations, including establishing a plant in Queensland to refine bauxite to alumina and to investigate building an aluminium smelter to smelt alumina to aluminium. The first obligation was fulfilled in 1967 when a consortium by the company commenced operation of the Queensland Alumina Ltd. Gladstone refinery. The economics of establishing a smelter improved dramatically after the discovery within Queensland of a number of new coal fields in the Bowen basin. In 1972 Comalco entered into further agreements with the State giving the company the right to opt for blocks of power from a new powerstation to be built at Gladstone. Partly funded by the Australian Government on the condition that a portion of the power would be used for export industry. In 1974 Comalco began detailed investigations into a site for an Aluminium smelter in the Gladstone area. The power agreement defined a radius from the powerstation for the establishment of the plant. A local office was established in Gladstone to conduct site selection, environmental studies and infrastructure requirements. In 1975 the company opted for the first block of power. At the time the world aluminium industry was in recession. In August 1977 Comalco had obtained Australian Government, Queensland Government and Calliope Shire environmental approvals and began clearing and preliminary earthworks on the 50 Ha Boyne Island smelter site. It was not until 1978 that conditions improved sufficiently for Comalco to commit in principle to the establishment of the Boyne Island aluminium smelter. In August 1979 Comalco formed the consortium company to establish the smelter.. Initially the consortium comprised American and Japanese participants along with Comalco, an Australian company. All participants entered the project through an Australian subsidiary, and are obliged to take the whole of the production of the smelter in proportion to their shareholding. Comalco managed the construction and ongoing operation of the plant. The first aluminium was produced in Feb. 1982 on schedule and within budget. Potline 2 start-up was July 1983 and the smelter officially opened after that. Construction With approval of the project by the board the smelter development came under the Smelter Division of Comalco headed by Executive general manager Mr. Jim L. Merritt, he formed a team of experienced engineers to manage the design and construction. A wholly owned company Calliope Constructions Ltd (CCL) was formed with directors; New Projects general manager Mr. Jack M. Lees, responsible for the project fruition. Mr. Neil M. Jacobs Design Manager responsible for technology, plant design and day-to-day management of design. Mr John B. Gray Construction Manager responsible for site selection, environmental, infrastructure and day-to-day management of construction.. In 1974 along with establishment of its local office, field studies began and extensive discussions and negotiations were held with both Local and State Governments and departments. It was therefore possible to define the public facilities needed associated with a Boyne Island smelter site. As a result, a new community at Boyne Island / Tannum Sands was proposed. Comalco staff was actively involved in planning services for the new community and much of this was commenced before construction of the smelter itself began in earnest. By the time construction on the smelter site began, housing subdivisions were proceeding with new housing, (eventually nearly 500 homes) access roads, new bridges onto Boyne Island and another built to Tannum Sands, joining the two previous villages, water sewerage, power supplies and phones constructed. Caravan parks and quarters surrounding a new recreation club with sporting facilities initially for the construction workers but eventually for community use were completed. Nearly $40 million was spent by the company on community facilities. Reduction of the lead time activities was crucial in getting the project off to a successful start. With the foregoing arrangements Comalco were able to achieve a start on its project some 18 months ahead of competitors with similar plans. A 'fast track' approach was used for the main plant with simultaneous design and construction with multiple contractors. Although carrying out the technology selection and plant criteria development the company did not have staff to fully carry out detail design and contract supervision, so CCL decided on an arrangement where it retained project management responsibility and sought the services of a widely recognised engineer constructor. International inquiries were called and appointment of IBI made in June 1979, construction commenced on the plant in October 1979. The organisational arrangement was three tiered; CCL as owner's representative and project managers, the engineer / constructor as agent to CCL and individual contractors and suppliers, all contracts were with CCL. Over 3700 drawings were prepared, a design staff peak of 150 engineers and draftsmen (at a time before computer aided drawing) with a field staff of 140 engineers and supervisors. 180 installation contracts were let with a peak workforce of 1400 on site in 1981. The potline buildings were considered the longest buildings in Australia at nearly a kilometre in length and requiring for each potline 7,300 tonnes of steel, 32,000 cubic meters of concrete and 75,000sq meters of roofing and siding, with 7500 tonnes of aluminium busbar each. First concrete was placed in March 1980, and first steel in June 1980. In November 1981 the site was connected to electricity at 132 kV. For the initial smelter there were 1,500,000 cu m of earthworks, 116,000 cu m of concrete, 20,000 tonnes of steel, 250,000 sq m of sheeting, 1,000 electric motors, 560 km of cables, 50 km of piping and 60 km of cable racking. The CCL project team placed emphasis on local participation and opportunity for local engineers. Of the capital cost 77% was spent in Australia, 33% in Queensland and 19% in Gladstone. To ensure a smooth transition from construction to operations Comalco appointed senior management from existing operations under Mr. I. W. Reid and they were in place to assist with commissioning. As a green fields site the plant was designed for ease of expansion for an ultimate four potline configuration. Line 3 was constructed between 1994 and 1997. Technology The smelter comprises: * two potlines of 240 Sumitomo S-170 reduction cells commissioned in 1982; * one potline of 264 Pechiney AP-30 cells commissioned in 1997; and * a test group of 5 Comalco B32 cells commissioned in 2002.

The stations are owned by Buck Owens Production Company (which is controlled by the estate of Buck Owens) and the licenses are held by Owens One Company Inc. They broadcast a simulcast country music format to the inland central California region. KUZZ's radio signals can extend over 100 miles, from Los Angeles on some nights to Fresno with a little better audio in the north, all away to Barstow in the Mojave Desert and to Santa Maria by the Pacific Ocean. KUZZ was also the call sign of television station channel 45 which Owens owned at one time. It is now Justice Network affiliate KUVI. KUZZ was KAFY on 1490 kHz in 1947. It moved to 550 kHz in 1950. History In 1958, KUZZ (then KIKK) first began broadcasting a country music format on 800 AM. In 1960, the station manager, a local country and western star named \\"Cousin\\" Herb Henson, changed the calls to KUZZ. In 1966, country music singer Buck Owens purchased the station and kept the country format. One year later in 1967, Owens also purchased the 107.9 frequency. When Owens purchased the frequency, he did not actually start playing country music. He started it out as an alternative rock station. The calls letters for the new 107.9 would be KBBY-FM. In 1969 after low ratings at 107.9, Owens flipped the station to country and western and changed the call letters to KZIN-FM. KUZZ and KZIN were sister stations and both played a country format but KZIN differed from KUZZ by playing more new country than KUZZ. In 1977, plans were made to purchase rival country station AM 970 KBIS- AM. During that same time 800 AM was being sold to the Church of the Foursquare Gospel, which was headquartered in Los Angeles. The plan for 800 AM was to flip the format from country to a Christian format. In January 1977, 107.9 KZIN-FM flipped formats from country to an album oriented rock station. The first song on the new 107.9 was \\"New Kid In Town\\" by the Eagles. The new calls letters were KKXX-FM. At this time, 970 AM KUZZ became a full-time 24-hour country station (before then, it had been known as a \\"daytimer\\" and would only broadcast during the day and turn off at night). In 1984, Buck Owens increased the power of KUZZ to 5,000 watts and also purchased another AM country radio station, 550 KAFY. A couple years later, management at the station 970 AM KUZZ and 550 KAFY, decided to exchange dial positions. With music formats on the decline on the AM band, people were not listening to AM radio as in previous generations. In 1988, after competitors were saying they would bring country music to the FM dial, Owens decided to do that as well. He flipped rock station 107.9 KKXX to contemporary country KUZZ. The logo of the station is an artist impression of Owens' famous red, white, and blue guitar, which he used throughout most of his career. Programming The programming on this station features local personalities, most notably the locally produced morning show Gradowitz in the Morning which includes host Steve Gradowitz and Geoff Emery. Other weekday programming includes Tanya on mid- mornings and Brent Michaels on mid-days. Brent's show features \\"The Country Cafe\\", an hour of requests during the lunch hour. Kenn McCloud is on afternoons and Vic D is on nights. The night show is an all-request show and includes \\"The Top 8@8\\", a countdown of the eight most requested songs of the day. Overnights feature the syndicated show \\"After Midnite\\". Weekend and fill- in hosts include Lauren Carter, Ken Richards, Chris Townsend, Danny Christopher, Keith Jones and Kenny Hernandez.

The .hr domain was first registered in March 1993. Technologies and services = Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) = In Croatia ADSL was introduced in 2000 by the German owned operator T-Com, formerly HT (Hrvatski telekom, meaning Croatian telecom). DSL is the most common form of broadband. Flat-rate based plans are the most commonly used in conjunction with DSL. There are companies offering ADSL2+ Internet Access and TriplePlay. Local loops were expected to be unbundled after September 2006. , this has only partially been done. ADSL and fixed line phones use the same cable plant in most parts of the country, in some locations the line quality is not good enough to support a stable ADSL link, and in some locations there is no ADSL supporting telephone switch installed. The list of DSL providers in Croatia is: * Hrvatski Telekom (owned by Deutsche Telekom) - MAXadsl, with a TriplePlay plan MaxTV, nationwide) * Iskon Internet (owned by HT) - part of the network is locally based (in major urban areas), and partly services are run by local loop over T-Com copper lines, TriplePlay plan Iskon.TV, but only on the local part of the network for now. * Vipnet d.o.o. (owned by A1 Telekom Austria Group) * Optima Telekom d.d. - part of the network is locally based (in major urban areas), and partly services are run by local loop over T-Com copper lines, TriplePlay plan is called OptiTV. The reach for TriplePlay is extended gradually. *Transintercom d.o.o. *Magic Telekom d.o.o. *H1 telekom d.d. = WiMax = The oldest commercial WiMax provider is: Novi net d.o.o. WIMAX concessions were also given to Optima Telekom, WIMAX Telecom and Oda≈°iljaƒçi i veze d.d. (OiV). However, none of them has to the present day () realized the full potential of their concession, due to the high cost of the infrastructure which needs to be built. Also, the providers claim that there are not yet enough potential interested users for this technology. = Fiber to the Home (FTTH) = The existing Fiber to the Home provider, Metronet telekomunikacije d.d. T-Com, is performing a trial that is expected to take a few years time, to see the potential for nationwide coverage using FTTH technology. In mid-2009 a 28 floor building in Rijeka was equipped with FTTH providing triple play as a test site. Supposedly in three further cities similar test are being run. = Cable Internet = Cable Internet is available, but it is not as widespread as ADSL. There is one Cable Internet provider in Croatia, B.net Hrvatska d.o.o., also with a TriplePlay offer. = Mobile broadband = Mobile broadband Internet access is offered by the three national concession GSM operators: *T-Mobile Croatia, *VIPnet (Vodafone partner), and *Tele2 Croatia. There are both pre-paid and post-paid plans. All three providers cooperate with CARNet to provide a discount for users in the academic and education community - ordered by seniority they are named Mobile CARNet/VipmeCARNet (VIPnet), Tele2CARNet (Tele2 Croatia), Stick2CARNet (T-Mobile HR). It is not mandatory to register any personal data upon purchasing a prepaid plan (together with the USB based mobile modem stick), so any foreign citizen may also get it for in-land use. GSM coverage is very good, while EDGE and UMTS coverage is rather sparse, and the usage for higher speeds is only possible on certain, mainly urban locations and in the Adriatic Sea area. = National research and education network = CARNet is the national research and education network and a significant Internet provider for numerous end-users in the academic and educational community in Croatia. = Dial-up Internet = The dial-up Internet penetration in Croatia is still high, mainly in rural areas. This is due to the high penetration rate for fixed line telephones throughout country. There are several providers which also offer this rather old connection method: * T-Com Croatia - dial-up plans exist * Iskon Internet - the Iskon.Dial-Up service enables classic dial-up access, with several plans. * VIPnet - their Homebox + offer includes which they designate as \\"fixed line\\", but technically uses GSM has the plan which also offers Internet access. Also, the VIP online plan exists using classic modem lines. * Optima Telekom - OptiNET Dial-Up service * Globalnet - dial-up unified login data, also possible for usage by foreigners * There are also some smaller dial-up providers. = Wireless LAN hotspots = Some Wireless LAN (WLAN) hotspots exist in Internet caf√©s and some cities. There are also many volunteer-driven WLAN local-city networks, for example: * DJWireless (ƒêakovo), * OSWirless (Osijek), * TENG (Nova Gradi≈°ka), and * some others. They usually serve a small number of local users. VIPnet and Iskon Internet operate some hotspots commercially. = Satellite Internet = In the past, there were a few resellers of one-way satellite Internet services, which mostly ceased to exist with the arrival of increased ADSL coverage and reduced interest in the service. Currently (as of 2010), there is at least one reseller of a two-way satellite Internet service. However, this method of Internet access is not economically viable, except for a very few very remote areas. The equipment needed is not subsidized, unlike ADSL and FTTH trial equipment. When Croatia joined the European Union in the year 2013, it became an integral part of the agenda to close the digital divide. According to official data, satellite Internet coverage at the end of 2013 was 94%. = Commercial fiber = In Croatia there are various commercial fiber providers. Some of them: * Omonia https://omonia.com/about-us/ Internet censorship and surveillance There is no OpenNet Initiative country profile for Croatia, but it is shown as little or no evidence of Internet filtering in all areas (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools) on the ONI global Internet filtering maps.\\"Global Internet Filtering Maps\\", OpenNet Initiative.

She served as Sir Samuel Hood's flagship in the Leeward Islands and the Channel. During her 22-year career Centaur saw action in the Mediterranean, the Channel, the West Indies, and the Baltic, fighting the French, the Dutch, the Danes, and the Russians. She was broken up in 1819. Service in the Mediterranean Captain John Markham commissioned Centaur in June 1797 and the next year sailed for the Mediterranean. In November she participated in the occupation of Menorca (historically called \\"Minorca\\" by the British). On 13 November, Centaur, HMS Leviathan, and HMS Argo, together with some armed transports, relatively unsuccessfully chased a Spanish squadron. Argo did re-capture the British 16-gun Pylades-class sloop HMS Peterel, which the Spanish had taken the day before. The next year, on 2 February 1798, Centaur pursued two Spanish xebecs and a settee, all privateers in royal Spanish service. She captured the privateer La Vierga del Rosario, which carried fourteen brass 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 90 men. The other two vessels escaped. A year later, on 16 February 1799 Centaur, Argo and Leviathan attacked the town of Cambrils. Once the defenders had abandoned their battery, the boats went in. The British dismounted the guns, burnt five settees and brought out another five settees or tartans laden with wine and wheat. One tartan, the Velon Maria, was a letter of marque, armed with one brass and two iron 12-pounders and two 3-pounders. She had a crew of 14 men. Then on 16 March 1799, she and Cormorant drove the Spanish frigate Guadaloupe aground near Cape Oropesa. Guadaloupe, of 40 guns, was wrecked.Norie (1842), p. 275. In June, Centaur was involved in a brief action off Toulon before elements of Admiral Keith's fleet joined her. Centaur and fired at a brig- corvette and several settees off Toulon. They were then able to capture and destroy four of the settees.James (1837), Vol. 2, p. 262. In the Action of 18 June 1799, Markham's squadron captured a French squadron consisting of the 40-gun Junon, 36-gun Alceste, 32-gun Courageuse, 18-gun Salamine and 14-gun brig Alerte. The British took the captured vessels into service under their existing names, except that Junon became Princess Charlotte and Alerte became Minorca. Soon after, Centaur returned to England. While working in the Channel in late 1800 and early 1801, on 25 January 1801 Centaur sent the Danish galiots Bernstorff and Rodercken into Plymouth. The Danish ships were carrying bale goods and nuts.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p. 180. Under Captain Littlehales, while serving with the Channel Fleet, Centaur and her sister ship, Mars, collided off the Black Rocks during the night of 10 March. Centaur lost her main and main-top-mast, which killed two men and injured four as they fell.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.371. Mars lost her head, bowsprit, foremast and main top-topmast and then almost grounded near the √éle de Bas. In the last moment Canada was able to get a tow rope on her. Canada then towed Mars into Cawsand Bay.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, pp. 366 & 371. The subsequent court martial acquitted Marss captain and lieutenant of any negligence, but sentenced a lieutenant from Centaur to the loss of six months' seniority and dismissal from his ship.Grocott (1997), pp. 110‚Äì111. Service in the West Indies Late in 1802, Centaur sailed to the West Indies where she joined Vice Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth's squadron in Jamaica. When Commodore Sir Samuel Hood arrived to take command in the Leeward Islands, he raised his pennant in Centaur. On 26 June 1803 Centaur participated in the capture of Saint Lucia and its citadel, Morne Fortun√©e; three days later the expedition took Tobago from the French.Southey (1827), Vol. 3, pp.230-1. The fleet went on to capture the Dutch islands. On 21 August 1803, Centaur and captured the American ship Fame and her cargo of flour and corn. Then on 31 August Centaur detained the Dutch ship Good Hope, which was carrying wine and cordage. On 20 September the British seized Demerara. The corvette Hippomenes, which was acting as a guard ship at Fort Stabroek, where she looked after the Governor's maritime affairs and served as harbour master for visiting ships,Southey (1827). Vol. 3, pp. 232-4. was the only vessel belonging to the Batavian Republic there and was included in the terms of capitulation. The British took her into service as . In September Hood also received the assignment to blockade the bays of Fort Royal and Saint Pierre, Martinique. On 22 October Centaur captured the French privateer Vigilante. She was armed with two guns and had a crew of 37 men. The pursuit took seven hours.Naval Chronicle, 30 June 1804, Vol. 11, p. 156. Centaur was sailing past Cap des Salin√©s, Martinique, early in the morning of 26 November when a battery fired at her. Hood had Maxwell anchor in Petite Anse d'Arlette. Then a landing party made up of Centaurs marines and about 40 sailors destroyed the battery. They also threw its six 24-pounders over the cliff. The militia guarding the battery had a brass 2-pounder gun but fled without putting up any resistance even though the landing party had to climb a steep, narrow path. Unfortunately, the premature explosion of the battery's magazine cost Centaur one man killed, and three officers and six men wounded, the only casualties from the operation. Then Centaur discovered another battery, this one armed with two 42-pounders and a 32-pounder, between the Grande and Petite Anse d'Arlette. The French abandoned the battery when a landing party approached. Once again, Centaurs men threw the guns over the cliff and destroyed a barracks and the ammunition stored there.Naval Chronicle, 30 June 1804, Vol. 11, p. 155. Centaur was anchored in Fort Royal Bay, Martinique, when on the morning of 1 December she sighted a schooner towing a sloop. The pair were about six miles away and Hood believed that they were on their way to St. Pierre. He therefore instructed Maxwell to take Centaur in pursuit. Their prey did not initially notice them, but when they did, the schooner let go her tow and the vessels separated. After a pursuit that extended over 24 leagues, Centaur captured the schooner. She turned out to be the privateer Ma Sophie, out of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 46 men and had had eight guns that she had thrown overboard during the chase in an attempt to increase her speed. When Ma Sophie and the sloop separated, Centaur sent the Sarah, an advice boat, after the sloop, which she captured.. Hood decided to use Sophie as a tender to Centaur. Lieutenant William Donnett became her captain with the task of monitoring the channel between Martinique and Diamond Rock, a basalt island south of Fort-de-France, the main port of Martinique, for enemy vessels. Subsequently, Donnett and Sophie frequently visited the Rock to gather both the thick, broad-leaved grass that the crew could weave into sailors' hats, and a spinach-like plant called callaloo. Callaloo, when boiled and served daily, kept the crews of Centaur and Sophie from scurvy and was a nice addition to a menu too long dominated by salt beef.Boswall (1833), p.210. In late 1803 and early 1804, Centaur, under Captain Murray Maxwell, established several batteries on Diamond Rock. To ease its administration vis-√†-vis the Admiralty, The British commissioned the rock as HMS Diamond Rock. Hood garrisoned it with two lieutenants and 120 men under the command of Lieutenant James Wilkes Maurice, his first lieutenant. Unfortunately, at some point during this period and for an unknown reason, Sophie blew up, killing all but one man of her crew.Boswall (1833), p.212. (Diamond Rock fell to an overwhelming French attack on 3 June 1805.) On 3 February, Centaur sent her boats to cut out the French 18-gun brig-corvette Curieux from the Car√©nage, under the guns of Fort Edward at Fort-Royal harbour, Martinique. In the fight, the French lost 40 men killed and wounded, and the British had nine men wounded, including all three officers leading the cutting out party. The British took Curieux into the navy as HMS Curieux. Her original commander was Lieutenant Robert Carthew Reynolds, who had led the cutting-out party, but he died of the wounds he had received in the attack. His replacement as her commander was Lieutenant George Bettesworth of Centaur, also a member of the cutting-out party.Moore Holdsworth Macpherson, (1926), p.36. On 25 April 1804, Centaur arrived off the Surinam River after a three-week voyage from Barbados. Her flotilla consisted of Pandour, Serapis and Alligator, all three en flute, Hippomenes, Drake, the 10-gun schooner Unique, and transports carrying 2000 troops under Brigadier- General Sir Charles Green. The British proposed surrender terms that the Dutch governor rejected. As an initial step in the campaign, Centaur sent her boats to capture the battery of Friderici. The landing party captured the battery at the cost of four men killed and three wounded. The Dutch surrendered on 5 May and Hood made Captain Conway Shipley of Hippomenes post-captain and appointed him to Centaur. (One day earlier the Admiralty had promoted Shipley into the ex-French 28-gun frigate Sagesse; he later assumed command of her at Jamaica.) Hood next appointed Captain William Richardson of the 28-gun frigate Alligator to command Centaur and the Admiralty confirmed his appointment on 27 September. The British captured two Dutch men-of-war, the 32-gun frigate Proserpine, which they took into service as , and the 18-gun corvette Pylades, which they took into service as . The British also captured the George, a schooner of 10 guns, and three merchant vessels. On 30 July 1804, Centaur sent her boats into Basseterre Roads, Guadeloupe, where they cut out a schooner of unknown name and of two guns, as well as the privateer Elizabeth, which was pierced for 12 guns but mounting six. She had a crew of 65, most of whom were either killed, drowned, or swam ashore. The boats achieved these captures despite a complete lack of wind and under heavy grape and small arms fire from the batteries and troops that lined the beach. The boats had one man killed and five wounded, and brought out two wounded prisoners. Shipley described Elizabeth as \\"the fastest sailing Privateer out of Guadaloupe, and has been uncommonly fortunate this War.\\" Centaur also recaptured another , this one of Liverpool, that Decid√© (actually Grande Decid√©) had captured while Elizabeth was sailing from the coast of Africa with a cargo of slaves. Centaur detained, on suspicion, the \\"Grecian\\" ship St. Nicholas, which was carrying produce from Guadeloupe. Centaur also recaptured the schooner Betsey, which had been sailing in ballast. Then in December, Centaur recaptured the English ship Admiral Peckenham, which was carrying produce. Centaur sailed to England in the spring of 1805, before returning to the Leeward Islands. Centaur nearly collides with St. George A year later, on 29 July 1805, Centaur, under Captain Henry Whitby, in company with a squadron under Captain De Courcy, was sailing from Jamaica to join Nelson, when the squadron encountered a hurricane.Ellms (1841), pp.247-261. The storm threw Centaurs masts overboard, carried away her rudder and smashed and sent all her boats overboard.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.229-31. Leaks that had started when Centaur had run ground some weeks before worsened substantially. The crew, especially the marines, labored at her pumps. For sixteen hours they were barely able to offset the water coming in. On the second day of the storm, a huge wave almost brought the first-rate crashing into Centaur.Mechanics' magazine, and journal of the Mechanics Institute, Vol. 7, p.112. As the hurricane lessened and the seas became a little calmer, the crew was able to get a sail under Centaur, and use her hawsers to lash it to her, much reducing the leaks and bracing her shattered frame. To help keep Centaur afloat, the crew also threw all but a dozen or so guns overboard. The 74-gun third rate HMS Eagle was then able to tow Centaur into Halifax. There Commissioner John Inglefield, who had been captain of the previous Centaur when she foundered after the Atlantic hurricane of 16‚Äì17 September 1782, greeted her.Campbell (1818), pp.346-7.That same, earlier, hurricane had also sunk Ville de Paris, Ramillies, Glorieux, and Hector, all but Ramillies being prizes from the Battle of the Saintes. The convoy numbered some 94 vessels in all. A number of other British merchant and smaller navy vessels also sank, with the total death toll being around 3,500 men. At Halifax, Nova Scotia, Centaur was put on her side for repairs. At that time it was discovered that \\"14 feet of false keel was found off from the fore foot aft, which occasioned the leak.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 17, p.128. Officers of HMS Centaur in 1805 Captain Whitby married Catherine Dorothea Inglefield, the commissioner's youngest daughter, around the end of 1805. Whitby wanted to stay in Halifax so he made an exchange into the 50-gun fourth rate HMS Leander.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 28, pp.269-270. Captain John Talbot of Leander took command of Centaur on 5 December and sailed her home. Because of the damage she had suffered, Centaur missed joining Nelson and therefore being at the Battle of Trafalgar. The Channel and Eastern Atlantic In 1806, Centaur was under the command of Captain W. H. Webley and also served as flagship for Captain Sir Samuel Hood, who was acting as Commodore of the squadron off Rochefort. On 16 July, boats from each of the squadron's line-of-battle ships and and engaged in a cutting out expedition on two corvettes and a convoy in the Garonne. Lieutenant Edward Reynolds Sibley, Centaurs First Lieutenant, was badly wounded in the successful attack on the largest corvette, the five-year- old Caesar. Caesar was armed with eighteen guns and had a complement of 86 men, under the command of Monsieur Louis Francois Hector Fourre, lieutenant de vaisseau. One man from Centaur was killed and seven, including Sibley, were wounded. The other French vessels escaped up the river and the British boats that followed them, unsuccessfully, suffered heavy casualties. In addition to the losses from Centaur, the British had five men killed, 29 wounded, and 21 missing, most of whom were apparently taken prisoner. During the Action of 25 September 1806, Centaur captured Armide, and assisted in the capture of Infatigable, Gloire and Minerve. The British took all of them into the Royal Navy under their existing names. Centaur lost three men killed and three wounded. In addition, a musket ball shattered Hood's arm, which had to be amputated. The wound forced Hood to quit the deck and leave the ship in the charge of Lieutenant William Case. Towards the end of 1806, Hood received orders to join a secret expedition at the Cape Verde Islands. However, the expedition sailed before Centaur arrived. Hood then took a squadron under his command to cruise between Madeira and the Canaries. The Baltic In the summer of 1807, Samuel Hood had received a promotion to Rear-admiral of the red. On 26 July 1807, Centaur, with Commodore Sir Samuel Hood and Captain William Henry Webley, sailed as a part of a fleet of 38 vessels under Admiral James Gambier and bound for Copenhagen. Between 15 August and 20 October, she took part in the second Battle of Copenhagen when Gambier, together with General Lord William Cathcart, captured the Danish Navy in a preemptive attack. Taking command of the fleet at Copenhagen, he raised his pennant in Centaur on 18 October. Centaurs deployed her boats to blockade the harbour at Copenhagen and intercept any supplies arriving from the Baltic. At some point, her cutter attempted to take a Danish dispatch boat that was trying to sail from Copenhagen past the island of Moen to Bornholm. The Danish boat ran on shore just past a cliff where the Danes had stationed troops with two field pieces. The Danes on the cliff fired on the cutter, killing the lieutenant in charge and wounding a midshipman. Nevertheless, Midshipman Price, Master's Mate Walcott and the cutter's crew succeeded in taking their quarry and towing her off.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, pp.32-33 & 389. By 24 December, Centaur was again briefly in the Atlantic, this time participating in General William Beresford's (friendly) occupation of the island of Madeira. =Anglo- Russian War= In early 1808 Russia initiated the Finnish War in response to Sweden's refusal to bow to Russian pressure to join the anti-British alliance. Russia captured Finland and made it a Grand Duchy under the Russian Empire. The British decided to take counter-measures and in May sent a fleet, including Centaur, under Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez to the Baltic. On 9 July, the Russian fleet, under Admiral Peter Khanykov, came out from Kronstadt. The Swedes massed a fleet under Swedish Admiral Cederstrom, consisting of 11 line-of-battle ships and five frigates at √ñr√∂ and Jungfrusund to oppose them. On 16 August, Saumarez then sent Centaur and Implacable, under Captain Thomas Byam Martin, also a 74-gun third rate, to join the Swedish fleet. They chased two Russian frigates on 19 July and joined the Swedes the following day. On 22 August, the Russian fleet, which consisted of nine ships of the line, five large frigates and six smaller ones, moved from Hanko and appeared off the √ñr√∂ roads the next day. The Swedish ships from Jungfur Sound had joined Rear-Admiral Nauckhoff and by the evening of 24 August the combined Anglo-Swedish force had made its preparations. Early the next day they sailed from √ñr√∂ to meet the Russians. The Anglo-Swedish force discovered the Russians off Hanko Peninsula; as the Russians retreated the Allied ships followed them. Centaur and Implacable exhibited superior sailing and slowly outdistanced their Swedish allies. At 5am on 26 August Implacable caught up with a Russian straggler, the 74-gun Vsevolod (also Sewolod), under Captain Rudnew (or Roodneff). Vsevolod burning, after the action with the Implacable and Centaur, August 26, 1808 Implacable and Vsevolod exchanged fire for about 20 minutes before Vsevolod ceased firing. Vsevolod hauled down her colours, but Hood recalled Implacable because the Russian fleet was approaching. During the fight Implacable lost six dead and 26 wounded; Vsevolod lost some 48 dead and 80 wounded. The Russian frigate Poluks then towed Vsevolod towards Rager Vik (Ragerswik or Rogerswick), but when Centaur started to chase them the frigate dropped her tow. The Russians sent out boats to bring her in, in which endeavor they almost succeeded. They did succeed in putting 100 men aboard her as reinforcements and to replace her casualties. However, just outside the port, Centaur was able to collide with Vsevolod. A party of seamen from Centaur then lashed her mizzen to the Russian bowsprit before Centaur opened fire. Vsevolod dropped her anchor and with both ships stuck in place, both sides attempted to board the other vessel. In the meantime, Implacable had come up and added her fire to the melee. After a battle of about half an hour, the Russian vessel struck again. Implacable hauled Centaur off. The British removed their prisoners and then set fire to Vsevolod, which blew up some hours later. Centaur lost three killed and 27 wounded. Vsevolod lost another 124 men killed and wounded in the battle with Centaur; 56 Russians escaped by swimming ashore. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with the clasps \\"Implacable 26 Augt. 1808\\" and \\"Centaur 26 Augt. 1808\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Vice-Admiral Saumerez with his entire squadron joined the Anglo-Swedish squadron the next day. They then blockaded Khanykov's squadron for some months. After the British and the Swedes abandoned the blockade, the Russian fleet was able to return to Kronstadt. Return to the Mediterranean In 1809, Frederick Marryat, who would go on to become a famous author, joined Centaur as a midshipman. He continued to serve under Hood in the Mediterranean.While Centaur was cruising off Toulon, Marrayat jumped overboard to rescue a man who had fallen from the main-yard. This was his second such rescue. The first time was in 1806 while he was a midshipman on HMS Imperieuse. Capt. John Chambers White brought Hibernia to Port Mahon to be Hood's flagship. White then took command of Centaur.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.233. Centaur participated in the defence of Tarragona when French forces under Marshal Suchet besieged the city from May 1811. Captains Codrington, White, and Adam spent most nights in their gigs carrying out operations under cover of darkness to evacuate women, children and wounded. On 21 June the French broke in. They then reportedly massacred several thousand men, women and children and took many prisoners before setting fire to the city.Edinburgh annual register, Vol 4, Issue 1, p.306. The boats of the squadron had only been able to rescue some five or six hundred of the inhabitants. On 28 June Centaurs launch engaged the French on a beach at Tarragona, losing two men killed and three wounded. Centaur returned to Plymouth in October 1813. Channel Fleet Centaur first sailed to Saint Helen's Island, Quebec, and the Western Isles (the Azores), but arrived off Cherbourg by November 1813. On the evening of 6 April 1814, Centaur arrived at the Gironde. Her objective was to support in her attack on the French ship of the line Regulus. Also near her were three brigs and some other vessels. All were under the protection of shore batteries there. The plan was that a landing party in boats, to which Centaur had contributed, would storm Fort Talmont while Egmont would take advantage of high tide to attack Regulus. At midnight, before the attack had even begun, it became clear that the French had set fire to their ships, which were totally destroyed by morning.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.291. Before 9 April, a landing party of seamen and marines from the 38-gun frigate Belle Poule, under Captain George Harris, successively entered and destroyed the batteries of Pointe Coubre, Pointe N√®gre, Royan, Soulac, and M√®che. In January 1819, the London Gazette reported that Parliament had voted a grant to all those who had served under the command of Lord Viscount Keith in 1812, between 1812 and 1814, and in the Gironde. Centaur was listed among the vessels that had served under Keith in the Gironde. Final years After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Centaur made a few more cruises, including another to Quebec, in 1814. In the spring of 1815, under Capt. T. G. Caulfield, she sailed with HMS Chatham from Plymouth to the Western Islands again. On 26 August she left the Cape of Good Hope for England, arriving on 13 November. She was paid off in Plymouth three days later. She was broken up in November 1819. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References *Boswall, Captain, RN.

Biography Their first live was on 10 November 1999. The band started out by releasing three demos that were heavier visual rock. The mini album Egoism was released on 21 March 2001. After the band managed to sign with Tristar, they presented their new musical style that was lighter and more romantic. In autumn 2001, Ruli left the band and Tetora subsequently joined in as the new guitarist. Their new album Aula was a success despite that. Kaede then changed his name to Yuki and Tetora to Tomo. 29 January was the release day of their first DVD, Venus. In between the songs, there is much additional off-stage material. The mini album Birth continued in this new direction and this time the band was sent to France to record new PVs (Music Videos). The record company promoted the band a lot, which is unusual for smaller acts. Their trip to Paris was used for filming material for their next DVD, Video Birth, and for releasing a photo book called Birth in Paris. In 2003, ElDorado tired of searching for their final breakthrough and they decided to return to their roots. In order to symbolize the change, the band's name was changed to EllDorado and they changed their logo. The DVD Ekiribako was the first official material from the new style. EllDorado met trouble in the year 2004. Single releases were pushed back and the CD PUZZLE was cancelled completely. They officially disbanded on 26 August 2004. However, Elldorado returned together once more for a concert on 26 August 2006 at HOLIDAY Shinjuku.

The name \\"Alanchy\\" is derived from the Tamil words \\"Aalu\\" (Banyan tree) and \\"Anju\\" (Five). The whole area was owned by Alanchi Tharavad family and hence the name. There are Coastal Villages in the North- west (Midaalam) and South-west (Kurumabanai). Most of the people of Alanchy are Nadars among them 99% are Roman Catholic Christians.  History With a population of about 9,000 people, Alanchi is one of the smallest villages in India, however, the per capita income of the residents of the village is larger than many other villages of the nation. During the independence, Alanchi was a very poor village with very few houses and others living in huts. The primary occupation in then was climbing palm trees and selling palm juices. Jaggery was also made out of those palm juices - a task carried out by the women of Alanchi. Christianity set foot in Alanchy during the days of St. Francis Xavier, one of the missionaries of Catholic church, and hence 99% of the Alanchy people are Catholics. Still there is a belief among people of Alanchy that the Stone Cross, presently placed in the Church porch, was erected by St. Francis Xavier himself. The Catholic Church in Alanchy is 180 years old. The present Church is the third church and the patron Saint is rightfully St. Francis Xavier. Thanks to the efforts of Sri. V. Soosanthony Maistry, who was a Church architect and Contractor and with close proximity to the Syro Malankara Church, most of the residents of Alanchi were trained and offered jobs in the construction business owned by Sri. V.Soosanthony Maistry. He also funded the laying of the roads to the neighbouring village of Colachel, which had better connectivity to the other parts of the district. Soon there were money and joy in the houses of Alanchi. Huts slowly began to transform into Modern houses. There were great Vaithiyars and Varmanis (Native Physicians) whose contributions were immense for the health of people of Alanchy. The parish priests had contributed much for the development of Alanchy. Among them were Rev.Fr.Elias and Fr. Martin, Carmelite missionaries who lived in the late 19th century, responsible for the establishment of the first church in Alanchy. In early 1950s,Rev. Fr. C. M. Hillary laid the foundation stone for the modern Alanchy of today. He encouraged education among children and tried hard to establish a school. With expertise in building construction, the residents of Alanchi soon found opportunity in the then upcoming Middle Eastern economy. People one after another flocked to the GCC countries of Oman, Bahrain, the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. By the 1990s Alanchi was completely transformed into a modern village with most of the houses having electricity and television - which was still a luxury in other villages across the country.The church was renovated and the modern flooring and ceiling add beautu to the church. The altar was renovated with rich arts and architecture and the renovated church was blessed By Bishop Peter Remigius on 17 the February 2020.  Religion  Christianity is the primary religion of Alanchi. Almost everyone are Catholics, except for a few families of Hindus and Muslims. St. Francis Xavier had toured Alanchi and helped set up a small church which was the first known. Alanchi has a Catholic church dedicated to St. Francis Xavier and a nun's convent nearby.

As of 31 December 2014, France had 26 million Internet broadband and high-speed connections on fixed networks. In 2014, 80.7% of French households (22.5 million households) had Internet access (47 million users in January 2015, according to M√©diam√©trie), while 19.3% did not (5.4 million households, out of a total of 27.8 million households). In 2014, 82% of French people aged 12 and over had Internet access at home (even though only 77% used it), and 64% of French people aged 12 years and older connected daily to the Internet from home. Considering all connections locations (not only the home), 83% of French people were Internet users.http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/etude- CREDOC-diffusion-TIC-2014.pdf In metropolitan France, intense competition between Internet service providers has led to the introduction of moderately- priced high speed ADSL up to 28 Mbit/s (ATM), VDSL2 up to 100 Mbit/s, and FTTX up to 1 Gbit/s from ‚Ç¨26 per month.Bouygues Telecom: guide des tarifs They often include other services such as unlimited free VoIP telephone communications to land lines, and digital television. Dial-up internet access is considered outdated. Since around 2003, quotas have been seen as outdated and consequently all the fixed broadband internet offers in France are unmetered.  History  FNET, the French branch of EUnet, converted from UUCP to TCP/IP in 1986. During the summer of 1988, the INRIA connected the Sophia Antipolis NSFNet network to Princeton by a satellite link leased to France Telecom and MCI. The link became operational on 8 August 1988, and allowed INRIA researchers to access the US network and allowed NASA researchers access to an astronomical database based in Strasbourg. This was the first international connection to NSFNET and the first time that French networks were connected directly to a network using TCP/IP, the Internet protocol. Internet access was limited to research and education for some years.[Et Dieu crea l'Internet, Christian Huitema, , 1995, page 10] In 1992, almost simultaneously, French Data Network and Altern (via the Minitel service 3616 ALTERN) enabled the general public to connect to the Internet network. World Wide Web access did not yet exist at the time and the services offered were email, the news of the Usenet network, access to many software archives documentation, and access to Internet network machines. RENATER was the first network for research and higher education in France to use the Internet protocol suite in 1993. Initially the Internet was only available to a small number of users in a few companies and universities. The general public began to have access to Internet starting from 1994, and was democratized in the early 2000s with the emergence of ADSL. The first real public service provider was WorldNet which opened in February 1994 at the Computer Associates Expo. FranceNet, founded by Rafi Haladjian, launched its service in June 1994. These were followed by order Calvacom, Internet Way and Imaginet. AOL was a great success between 1996 and 2000 through its widely distributed, free CDs, and with attractive prices for low speeds. Lines On 3 December 2008, France had 16.3 million broadband connections, of which 94% are ADSL subscribers. This makes France the second largest ADSL market in Europe. At the end of 2005, 30% of those DSL lines were unbundled, and 37% of those unbundled lines were totally unbundled without any direct invoicing of the historical operator and a greater progression rate than partial unbundling. At the end of September 2005, more than 95% of the population can have a DSL connection, albeit some of them only 512/128. = \\"Zones Blanches\\" in France = An estimated households in rural areas are unable to be reached for ADSL connection, and must access Internet through other means, such Satellite Internet. To reduce the digital divide, many departments have chosen either to subsidize a map of departments that provide a grant to the satellite Internet access . Internet access via satellite, or to deploy radio networks, such as the WiMax. The French state has also chosen to subsidize some private operators to enable them to deploy fiber optics throughout the national territory.  Domain Names in France  The AFNIC is responsible for domain names in France, including .fr (France and the island of R√©union) and .pm (for Saint Pierre and Miquelon). Other domain names exist, such as .gf for Guyana, .nc for New Caledonia, .mq for Martinique, .yt for Mayotte, .pf for French Polynesia, .gp for Guadeloupe, .tf for French Southern and Antarctic Lands or .eu for the European Union. ADSL market Consumer access to digital networks started in France earlier than in other countries with the Minitel, a pre-World Wide Web online service invented by the PTT (Postes, T√©l√©graphes et T√©l√©phones). In May 1998, the number of French households connected to the Internet was an estimated (or 2.4% of French households), compared to in May 1997 and in May 1996.Les Echos June 10 1998 page 18 In June 2009 France occupied the third place in the number of households in European connected to Internet, behind Germany and the United Kingdom.

Those offers of naked DSL are also available in non- unbundled areas, and can lead to the economy of the traditional telephone subscription. ADSL technology After selling the first ADSL2+ offers in Europe, providing a speed of 18 Mbit/s down and 1 Mbit/s up in 2004, French operators continue to offer new services, driven by the competition.

He designed the resort destination of Asbury Park on the New Jersey Shore.JAMES A. BRADLEY (1830 - 1921) PAPERS, 1891 - 1897, Lois R. Densky, Gregory J. Plunges, April 1981. Bradley was also involved in the development of Bradley Beach, which bears his name.A Brief History on Bradley Beach, Bradley-Beach.com/ Biography Bradley was born on February 14, 1830 in Rossville, Staten Island to Hannah and Adam Bradley. At age sixteen, in 1846, he became an apprentice brush maker for Bernalds and Weeks in New York City. In 1857 he established his own brush making business, Bradley & Smith, in New York City. Bradley was married to Helen M. Packard of Boston; they had no children. Bradley converted from Catholic to Methodist, and was very close philosophically with the leaders of the Ocean Grove Meeting Association who ran the summer retreat on the New Jersey shore. These relationships lead Bradley to focus his attention on developing the area around Ocean Grove. On January 24, 1871, Bradley acquired approximately of land east of the New York and Long Branch railroad, between Wesley and Deal lakes. Bradley named the new community Asbury Park after Francis Asbury, the founder of Methodism in the United States. Bradley served as the first postmaster of Asbury Park from 1874 to 1884, and established the city's first newspaper, the Asbury Park Journal (1876‚Äì1910) in 1876, serving as its editor and until 1882. Bradley began Asbury Park‚Äôs first sewerage system in 1881, and setup water & gas works in 1884. Bradley also served as Mayor of Asbury Park, New Jersey and councilman. In 1894, Bradley was elected to the New Jersey Senate from Monmouth County. The City of Asbury Park sued Bradley for control of his beach front property, and sewer system in 1902. Bradley lost the suit. Bradley died June 6, 1921. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. Legacy Statue at Bradley Park in Asbury Park, New Jersey A statue of Bradley stands in front of the Paramount Theater and Convention Hall complex in Bradley Park. Constructed shortly after his death to mark the 50th anniversary of the city's founding, a campaign began in 2017 to remove the statue based on Bradley's history of instituting segregation on the beach and boardwalk that he owned. Bradley was pressured into this by hotel owners and a campaign by the Asbury Park Daily Journal upon complaints of White visitors in 1885. Previously, the oceanfront was open to all.David Goldberg, Greetings from Jim Crow, New Jersey: Contesting the Meaning and Abandonment of Reconstruction in the Public and Commercial Spaces of Asbury Park, 1880-1890. Bradley openly explained his motivations to Black groups. He felt that should Asbury Park remain integrated and cease to attract White visitors, economic ruin would result. The city's economy was negatively impacted in the 1970s when the number of White visitors declined after the beach and boardwalk were reintegrated. Members of the Asbury Park Historical Society acknowledged Bradley's use of segregation but opposed removal of the statue.Bogues, Austin. \\"Don't tear down Asbury Park founder statue, history group pleads\\", Asbury Park Press, September 27, 2017.

Werner Baumgartner, city historian for Asbury Park, said in addition to being the city's founder Bradley served as the city's mayor for several terms.\\" Bradley set aside park lands, waterfront areas, and urban scale blocks, that widened at the ocean. Bradley donated land to religious and civic groups, and the public library. Bradley is responsible for the creation of the mile long oceanfront boardwalk that remains today.

Internet censorship and surveillance Greece practices some internet censorship, including the blocking of websites that offer unauthorized online gambling. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Independent media are active and express a wide variety of views. Individuals can criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal, and the government does not impede criticism. However, the law provides for prosecution of individuals who \\"intentionally incite others to actions that could provoke discrimination, hatred, or violence against persons or groups of persons on the basis of their race or ethnic origin or who express ideas insulting to persons or to groups of persons because of their race or ethnic origin.\\" In practice the government has never invoked these provisions. The law permits any prosecutor to order the seizure of publications that insult the president, offend any religion, contain obscenity, advocate for the violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose military secrets. The law provides criminal penalties for defamation, however, in most criminal defamation cases, authorities released defendants on bail pending trial and they served no time in jail. The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. However, NGOs such as the Greek Helsinki Monitor report that authorities do not always respect these provisions in practice.\\"Greece\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, April 2013.

On November 1, a court acquitted him; prosecutors appealed the verdict, and a re-trial date was pending at the end of 2012. In the 2013 re-trial, he was acquitted again. In September 2012 the cyber-crime police arrested a 27-year-old man, F. Loizos, charging him with \\"malicious blasphemy and insulting religion\\". The man reportedly created a Facebook page under the name \\"Elder Pastitsios\\" that played on the name of a legendary Mount Athos monk famous for his prophecies about Greece and Orthodox Christianity, and the name of a popular Greek dish. The cyber-crime police seized the man‚Äôs laptop and removed the Facebook page. On January 16, 2014, he was found guilty of \\"repeatedly insulting religion\\" and was sentenced to ten months in jail, suspended while the prosecutor had recommended a smaller sentence. In the 2017 re-trial, however, the court acquitted Loizos. On August 6, 2009, the most- visited Greek blog (troktiko.blogspot.com) was shut down. Although Google cites potential violations of the terms of use, comments implying other reasons behind the closure of the Troktiko blog were published in several leading Greek blogs. The blog went back on-line a few months later and suspended its activities in July 2010, after the assassination of Sokratis Giolias, its administrator. On June 29, 2009, George Sanidas, the soon-to-be- retired Prosecutor of the Greek Supreme Court (Areios Pagos), declared that \\"Internet-based communications are not covered by current privacy laws\\" and are thus open to surveillance by the police. Such surveillance would be, according to Sanidas's mandate, completely legal. Following this proclamation, Greek bloggers, legal experts and notable personalities from the media have claimed that Sanidas's mandate contravenes both the Greek constitution and current EU laws regarding the privacy of Internet communications. Furthermore, this mandate has been greatly criticised as being a first step towards full censorship of all Internet content.* \\"Œ£œÄŒ¨ŒµŒπ œÑŒø Œ±œÄœåœÅœÅŒ∑œÑŒø œÑœâŒΩ ŒµœÄŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒπœéŒΩ œÉœÑŒø ŒôŒΩœÑŒµœÅŒΩŒµœÑ\\" (\\"Breaks the confidentiality of communications on the Internet\\" ), Alexander Avlonitis, ŒïŒòŒùŒüŒ£.gr, Nation Publishing SA, 30 June 2009.

It lies between Crieff and Loch Turret, north of the A85. History The estate was the subject of a violent blood feud between the Murray clan and Drummond clan in the neighbourhood in the late 1400s. The Murrays of Ochtertyre had been engaged by their relative, the abbot of nearby Inchaffray Abbey, with collecting teinds from the Drummonds of Monzievaird. They did this with such brutality that the Drummonds were provoked into retaliation. They went to Ochtertyre and tried to evict the Murrays from their land. The conflict led to the Battle of Knock Mary, which the Murrays lost, and the subsequent Massacre of Monzievaird. The episode was captured by the historical novelist Walter Scott in his book A Legend of Montrose. Members of the Murray family living here included William Murray of Ochtertyre and his son Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre. The estate was sold by the Murrays to the Dundas family in the early 19th century. Robert Burns visited Sir William Murray at Ochtertyre on his third northern tour with Nicol. The house is a category A listed Georgian building dating from 1784‚Äì1790. Its architect is unknown. The house bought by the wealthy Dundas family in 1812 and its inhabitants included: * George Dundas, Lord Manor * Captain James Dundas, who won the Victoria Cross for his actions in Afghanistan in 1879 * David Dundas, Lord Dundas * William John Dundas, FRSE.

The village is close to the River Ray on the northern edge of Otmoor. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 129. History The toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"Ot(t)a's Hill\\", possibly after the same person who gave his name to Otmoor. Parish church The monumental brass of Ralph Hamsterley (died 1518) at Oddington in Oxfordshire. Hamsterley was rector of Oddington and also warden of University College Oxford. This brass, which shows his body wrapped in a shroud being eaten by worms, was one of five identical brasses Hamsterley laid down before his death. Only one (at Oxford) was over his grave. A mention of Oddington in a Papal bull written in AD 1146 suggests that the village had a parish church by the middle of the 12th century. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew was built at the end of the 13th century and beginning of the 14th century. The buttresses of the nave are late 13th century, and the font is probably also from that century. Some features of the chancel are early 14th century, but in 1821 the chancel was demolished and rebuilt. Between 1884 and 1886, the church was heavily restored under the direction of the architect E.G. Bruton. The bell tower and the north wall of the chancel were rebuilt, the vestry and north aisle were added and several windows inserted. Inside the church are two unusual monuments. The first is an early 16th-century monumental brass in memory of Ralph Hamsterley, who had been parish priest and died in 1518. It is a cadaver monument, showing his corpse in its burial shroud, which is a style unusual for monumental brasses in England. Elsewhere there is an example from the late 14th century, also in memory of a parish priest, in the parish church at Lytchett Matravers in Dorset. Margaret Staples Browne in St Andrew's churchyard. Browne was a MƒÅori princess whose maiden name was Papakura The second unusual monument is a large piet√† at the west end of the nave. It is decorated with MƒÅori totems in memory of MƒÅori servicemen killed in the First World War. The tower has three bells. The treble was cast in 1609, but the bellfounder has not been identified. James Keene of Woodstock cast the tenor in 1626. Thomas I Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the youngest of the three bells in 1804. The ring was converted for chiming in 2012. There is also a Sanctus bell, cast by an unknown founder in about 1614, but it is cracked. Gilbert Sheldon held the living of the parish from 1636. Sheldon already held the living of Hackney, received that of Ickford, Buckinghamshire at about the same time as that of Oddington, and at some time also the living of Newington, Oxfordshire. After the Restoration of the Monarchy, Sheldon was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in 1663. The Syriac scholar William Cureton was curate of Oddington for a time in the 19th century.

Bruschi, Edifici privati di Bramante a Roma, in \\"Palladio\\", a.II n.4, 1989 The style of architecture was influenced by that of the papal chancery, the Palazzo della Cancelleria, one of Rome's first Renaissance palaces, which had been completed a few years earlier. The palazzo's arcaded inner courtyard has been attributed to Raphael. In 1504, before its completion, the Cardinal (who had fallen from papal favor) presented the palazzo to King Henry VII of England. The English king Henry VIII later handed it to Lorenzo Campeggio, England's last Cardinal Protector. He lived in the unfinished palazzo from 1519 to 1524.

Market penetration in Portugal is around 50% although Portugal has the distinction of being one of the few European countries to have coverage in virtually the entire territory. There are several service providers offering ADSL, fiber and wireless services in Portugal to the residential and the professional markets. The majority of the residential market is split between the two larger operators: Portugal Telecom and Sonae. The current maximum speed for home Internet plans in Portugal is 1 Gbit/s, available on special request, and 360 Mbit/s is widely available together with television and telephone services. =Portugal Telecom= A former monopoly, Portugal Telecom is still the largest telecommunications company in the country. Due to its previous monopoly status its copper landline infrastructure covers all territory, making it the only operator that can offer direct service anywhere in the country. Portugal Telecom uses different brands to segment their ADSL service, among others SAPO for the residential market and Telepac for the small business market. In November 2006 Portugal Telecom announced their ADSL2+ service, adding a 24 Mbit/s speed grade service to their market offer and effectively catching up to competitor Sonaecom that had been offering ADSL2+ speed grades for several months. Portugal Telecom was also the first to deploy fiber in the country, being that ZON, Vodafone and Sonae followed with their deployment after being denied access to Portugal Telecom's infrastructure. =Sonae= Sonaecom started operations in 1999, soon after the government opened the telecommunications market to competition. The company started by renting Portugal Telecom's lines in order to offer their voice service to customers, but soon started laying their own infrastructure and can now offer direct service in the main metropolitan areas. Sonaecom also uses different brands to segment their ADSL offer, these include Optimus Clix for the residential market and Novis enabling the company to offer Triple Play services to customers in select areas. Taking advantage of the increased bandwidth provided by their ADSL2+ network, Sonaecom announced in June 2006 the launch of their IPTV service, SmartTV. =Other ADSL and fiber providers= * Vodafone * ZON Multim√©dia Cable =Cable service providers= * Cabovis√£o * ZON Multim√©dia Internet censorship and surveillance Internet access in Portugal is not restricted.\\"Portugal\\", Freedom in the World 2013, Freedom House.

It is the first and oldest state university in Northern Luzon which offers low tuition fee, tracing its roots to 1906, which is older than the University of the Philippines by two years. It is the only state university in the province aimed for less-fortunate people and one of three state-owned educational institutions of higher learning operating in Ilocos Sur (with the Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State College and the Northern Luzon Polytechnic State College, a former branch of the university). History The university began as the Vigan High School (present-day Ilocos Sur National High School) in 1906. Its shop department was converted into a separate intermediate level school, named the Vigan Trade School in 1910. It opened its high school in 1927 and produced its first graduates in 1931, when it evolved as the Ilocos Sur Trade School. They were both in Vigan town. Two of the buildings still exist: one being used as a warehouse for a construction supply firm, the other is the location of the Vigan City Trade Center. President Manuel Luis Quezon converted the Ilocos Sur Trade School in 1941 through the help of Assemblyman Benito T. Soliven and Governor Pedro Singson Reyes. However, World War II halted its implementation. In 1951 the Ilocos Sur Trade School became the Northern Luzon School of Arts and Trades (NLSAT) by virtue of Republic Act 547. However, Republic Act 2700, or the General Appropriations Act of 1960, converted it back to Ilocos Sur School of Arts and Trades (ISSAT). It proved temporary: On June 19, 1965, then-Congressman Floro S. Crisologo authored Republic Act 4449.https://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno4449.html#.Xx- wYigzaHs It was signed into law at the Philippine Embassy in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, converting ISSAT into the University of Northern Philippines. It then began implementing its Charter on October 14, 1965. Crisologo is recognized as the founder of the university. The Candon Community College (CCC) was incorporated into the university in 1989 through Republic Act 6744,https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1989/08/11/republic-act-no-6744/ through the efforts of then-Congressman Eric D. Singson. It acted as a semi- autonomous unit. Despite this semi-autonomous status, CCC was split from the university by virtue of Republic Act 10085,http://senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2010085.pdf also by Singson, to become the Northern Luzon Polytechnic State College in 2010.https://www.nlpsc.edu.ph/index.php/2014-06-26-07-44-54/historical- background In the late 1980s the commitment of the university to the new Stepladder Nursing Curriculum pioneered in Palo, Leyte was marked by the construction of the College of Health Sciences building, formerly the tallest building in the university (the under-construction Ladies' Dormitory Building will become the tallest) and one of the tallest in Ilocos Sur, finished in 1997. It currently houses the individual Colleges of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the university-owned radio station dwNP. In 2008 the university's FM radio station, dwNP Campus Radio, was relaunched. It occupies the 100.5 MHz frequency, moving from its old, weak 88.5 MHz frequency. In 2009 two devastating fires struck the university, part of the Father Jose Burgos Hall, which houses the College of Arts and Sciences and the Elpidio Quirino Hall, which houses the University Administration. Despite these setbacks, especially to the Administration Building, the university fully recovered in a few months and construction of a bigger three-story Administration Building was started to replace it. Offices once occupying the burned Administration Building has been temporarily transferred to the Graduate School's E-Library Building, while the President's Office occupied three rooms in the Lauro B. Tacbas (Criminology) Building. The new Administration building has been inaugurated in 2014 and it now houses all administration offices. The University Infirmary was due for completion in 2009 but was delayed to give priority to the construction of the Administration Building. It was inaugurated on July 4, 2011. The fully operational hospital now houses the College of Medicine, which was spun off from the College of Health Sciences starting SY 2014‚Äì2015. Under the administration of University President Gilbert R. Arce, an unprecedented sweeping wave of reforms led to various successes in the local, national, and even international scenes. During this period, amidst organizational reforms (including the shifting of the opening of the school year to the month of August‚Äî-the first to do so in Ilocos Sur) and infrastructure changes (including the building of a new Gymnasium, the University Hostel, and the tallest in-campus Dormitory Building in Ilocos Sur (still under construction)), the University attained attention when two of its graduates from the College of Medicine landed First in the Medical Council of India board examinations.http://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/07/13/17/ph-trained- indian-doctor-tops-indias-medical-board-exam Campuses * Vigan Campus is located in Barangay Tamag; houses most of its 14 core colleges, the University Infirmary, and the university's FM radio station * Sinait Campus houses the Upland Research and Development Center * Quimmarayan Campus houses the agricultural, fishery and research courses; and the Environmental Research and Training Center * Santa Maria Campus houses the Marine Research and Development Center Graduate School Due to the implementation of Vertical Articulation, all of its courses have been transferred under the jurisdiction of appropriate colleges, thus abolishing the Graduate School as a separate entity. * Doctor of Education * Doctor of Public Administration * Doctor of Business Administration * Master of Arts in Education: Educational Management, Guidance * Master of Public Administration: Local Government, Government Administration, Police Administration * Master of Arts in Teaching: English, Filipino, Practical Arts, Home Economics, Health Education, Physical Education, Nursing * Master of Science in Teaching: Physics, Chemistry * Master of Arts in Mathematics Education * Master of Statistics * Master of Business Administration * Master of Arts in Nursing * Master of Guidance & Counseling Open University * Bachelor of Science in Criminology * Master of Public Administration * Master in Social Work * Master of Arts in Nursing * Master of Arts in Education: Science Education, Mathematics Education College of Law * Bachelor of Laws College of Architecture * Bachelor of Science in Architecture * Bachelor of Science in Interior Design * Certificate in Architectural Interiors * Certificate in Building Technology * Certificate in Landscape Gardening College of Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Geodetic Engineering * Bachelor of Science in Sanitary Engineering College of Arts and Sciences * Bachelor of Arts in Communication * Bachelor of Arts in Political Science * Bachelor of Arts in English * Bachelor of Science in Psychology * Bachelor of Science in Biology * Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology * Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies * Bachelor of Science in Mathematics * Bachelor of Science in Physics * Bachelor of Science in Statistics College of Business Administration and Accountancy * Bachelor of Science in Accountancy * Bachelor of Science in Business Administration: Human Resources Development Management, Financial Management * Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship * Bachelor of Science in Cooperative Management * Associate in Office Management College of Information and Communication Technology * Bachelor of Science in Computer Science * Bachelor of Science in Information Technology * One-year Computer Technology College of Criminology * Master in Criminal Justice * Bachelor of Science in Criminology * Bachelor of Science in Law Enforcement Administration College of Social Work * Bachelor of Science in Social Work College of Fine Arts * Bachelor of Fine Arts: Advertising Arts, Painting * Associate in Commercial Arts * Bachelor of Science in Interior Design College of Health Sciences This college, organized as the Institute of Community Health, originally intended to lead students into Medicine (as Level V) through a Step-Ladder version of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing curriculum as a Department of Health pilot project.

Cadorna (2019‚Äìpresent) Student Council Presidents/Student Regents The UNP University Student Council (UNP - USC) had always been the forefront of student governing bodies in Northern Luzon. With its autonomy and governing power given by the UNP Board of Regents, the UNP - USC has been an active workforce and influence on other educational institutions in Luzon and the entire country. This includes outside participation of the council on local and national issues and its outstanding stand on issues affecting the students. Major accomplishments includes major infrastructure projects on Rallojay, de Vera and Torricer's incumbency as presidents and Student Regents for the University's Board of Regents. Ragunton's term made an immediate action on the issues being equaled to the council to return its reputation after a scandalous money laundering issue on Alegre's incumbency. In 2001, Student Council President Julio Alegre, then a junior Mass Communications student, laundered close to half a million pesos in Student Council Funds. He was not able to continue his studies and is currently at large. Erwin Rallojay has formed a strong set of council officers and has set new implementing guidelines on student governance. De Vera's term introduced the Student Council Volunteer Corp. He also became the Region I Chairperson of the National Confederation of Student Regents of the Philippines (NCSRT). The UNP - USC were able to sponsor a National Seminar on Environmental Summit and was the first to stage the Miss Earth UNP which is different from the Miss UNP Beauty and Brains Pageant held every year. The referendum for the Student Council's Constitution and By Laws was also conducted. Majority of the almost 13,000 student population for 2003 of the University voted for \\"YES\\" with the said referendum. Torricer's term marks another milestone on the Student Council achievements. After the referendum, Emilio Arnold Torricer became the first president under the New SC Constitution and By Laws and having three vice presidents namely; Vice President for Operations, Student Concerns and UNP - Candon City Campus. He also became the Regional Commissioner of the National League of Student Regents and Trustees of State Universities and Colleges of the Philippines (NLSRTP) as mandated by CHED, PASUC and the National Youth Commission (NYC). Additional working umbrella organizations under the University Student Council has been conceived because of the New Constitution and by Laws. The Council of Students Interest Groups (CSIG) which is composed of 42 Accredited Organizations of the University, the Mandated Organizations (includes mother organizations of each 14 Colleges) and the PROFRAT (Peaceful, Responsible and Organized Fraternities) which has 17 member fraternities and sororities. The Student Council has undergone several changes and adjustment with the new constitution. During the year, they first staged the Student Fair and the first ever Mr. and Miss UNP. A new strong blood emerges at the College of Nursing, Warren Rafal visualize a service-oriented Student Council that caters pro-student activities and projects. He acknowledges the importance of student facility improvement and provide LCD projectors for medical and nursing colleges, machinery for hands-on in technology colleges and educational material in instruction colleges. During Rafal's term, the Student Fair was transformed to Student Festival which highlights all activities of the student council like Body painting, Street painting, Larong Pinoy, Dance Craze, Battle of the Bands, SYMBO game (Bingo type game which uses chemical symbols), and Student's cocktail street party. Aside from quizzes, student development programs, career sponsorships, leadership seminars, the dependability of the UNP - USC has been proven worthy by time. The present administration of the USC has been affected with other much difficult issues and was believed to have lost in track in serving the students. It stands by this motto: \\"The Students' Voice is OUR Voice.\\" The last Student Council elections became controversial when a disqualification case was filed against Cesar Borillo Jr. But the students' voice had prevailed. Winning an overwhelming votes from those who believe in him had become his vindication. At the end, Borillo was declared as the new Student Regent. The said election controversy was even discussed by a national television station through its regional bureaus' local newscast. However, Borillo has proven them that he is worthy of the position. He has been consistently showing good performances during Board meetings. The 44th foundation celebrations were made remarkable because of the activities that the Student Council conducted. For now, the present UNP Student Council with the undying support of the UNP administration paved way in the building of the Students' Study Haven and boats were also stationed at the UNP lagoon for the use of every UNPian. University student publications College departments in the university have their own publications, with the University's main school publication being the New Tandem, and Layap as its literary folio. The university's official publication is the UNP Chronicle. The University Chapter of the Junior Philippine Institute of Accountants has its own publication, The Ledger.

The Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Serbia is .rs and .—Å—Ä–±. (Cyrillic)https://www.rnids.rs/en/domains/national-domains History =Introduction of the Internet= Linking of Yugoslavia into global electronic networks began at the end of the 1980s. The European Academic Research Network (EARN) was functioning in Europe at that time. In 1988 the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Belgrade, proposed that Yugoslav universities join the EARN. The University of Belgrade became a node of the EARN in 1989, when the first international connection of the academic network between Belgrade and Linz became active. The capacity of this link initially was 4800 bit/s and it was later doubled to 9600 bit/s. The project of developing the academic network functioned within the project of developing the system of scientific-technological information (SNTIJ) and was managed by the University of Maribor and the institute Jo≈æef ≈†tefan from Ljubljana. These institutions took on the responsibility of organising the first .yu domain register between 1990 and 1991. =1990s= The development of the Internet in Serbia faced with very difficult circumstances, during the breakup of Yugoslavia. In the middle of 1992 the UN Security Council imposed all- inclusive sanctions against the newly formed Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro. The sanctions did not exclude telecommunications and all such government-funded projects came under the sanctions. It was not long before the only Yugoslav Internet link, connecting the Yugoslav academic network to EARN, was shut down. The sanctions prevented foreign companies from doing any kind of business with Yugoslav firms, so it was impossible to establish any commercial Internet links with Yugoslavia. Before November 1995 the only way to access the Internet from Yugoslavia was by using an extremely expensive and slow X.25 packet network or by directly dialing ISPs abroad. These methods were used only by a few of the largest Yugoslav companies and by the academic network. After the Dayton peace agreement was signed in the middle of November 1995 ending the war in Bosnia, some of the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia were lifted, opening the possibility of decent Internet access. On 14 December 1995, Belgrade's Radio B92 formed an Internet division which became known as Opennet. A 128 kbit/s leased phone line link between Radio B92 and the XS4All ISP in Amsterdam was sponsored by the Fund for an Open Society. Opennet became the first Yugoslav ISP to offer affordable public Internet access, e-mail accounts, and Web space. Like Radio B92, Opennet strongly supported the Internet as a means of free expression and promoting tolerance and open communication. The Electronic Frontier Foundation honored Opennet's director Drazen Pantic as the EFF Pioneer for 1999, in recognition of his continued promotion of these values and of his contribution to the development of civil society in Yugoslavia. Opennet was also the first Yugoslav ISP to offer public Internet access in three computer centers, known as \\"Opennet classrooms\\", in Belgrade. Shortly after Opennet started up, on 26 February 1996 the first commercial Yugoslav ISP, Beotel, established a 512 kbit/s satellite link with the Norwegian ISP Taide.net. In April 1996 another commercial provider started up with a local branch of EUnet International (now KPNQwest). It started with a 2 Mbit/s digital ground link with Amsterdam and remains the largest and strongest ISP in Serbia. At the beginning of April 2001 EUnet owned two satellite and ground Internet links with an overall capacity of 10 Mbit/s. During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Internet was a significant source of uncensored information for the population of Serbia, as well as a chance for Serbians to show their own view of the bombing to the world. Serbian analyses of the latter usually conclude that use of Internet for this was successful. However, it still didn't attain a widespread adoption due to various socioeconomic difficulties such as conflicts, general poverty, overall computer illiteracy (as a result of mentioned factors among others) and detrimental effects of sanctions and isolation, but still didn't lag dramatically in comparison to the countries in the region of somewhat higher level of economic development and similar socialist past, such as Romania. =2000s= Dial-up was the only way to access the Internet until the early 2000s, when several ISPs started to offer wireless access via unlicensed hardware. The equipment required for access was too expensive for most people (about 200 euros), so this type of connection was popular only in limited urban areas. The situation changed in 2002 when Serbia Broadband (SBB), then a growing cable operator, approached subscribers with a cable Internet option of a tariff based 128 kbit/s access. As of 2019 SBB offers speeds up to 300 Mbit/s. In 2005 Telekom Srbija started offering ADSL2+ service and in 2013 added VDSL2 service. =Contemporary period= According to a survey conducted in 2015, there were 4.99 million Internet users, 71% of the population.http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/repository/documents/00/02/25/86/IKT__2016_pres_s.pdf In 2012 Serbia ranked 44th in the world with 1.1 million Internet hosts.\\"Communications: Serbia\\", World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 28 January 2014.

Retrieved 31 January 2014. The constitution and law provides for freedom of speech and press. However, the constitution specifically allows restrictions on speech \\"to protect the rights and reputation of others, to uphold the authority and objectivity of the courts and to protect public health, morals of a democratic society and national security of the Republic of Serbia.\\" While the law does not include a specific provision on hate speech, it is a criminal offense to \\"incite\\" national, racial, or religious intolerance. In June 2011 the Constitutional Court banned the extreme right-wing organization Nacionalni Stroj (National Front) for promoting racist hate speech. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. While the law requires the Ministry of Interior to obtain a court order before monitoring potential criminal activity and police to obtain a warrant before entering property except to save persons or possessions, police occasionally fail to respect these laws. Most observers believe authorities selectively monitor communications, eavesdrop on conversations, and read mail and e-mail. Human rights leaders also believe that authorities monitor their communications. The law obliges telecommunications operators to retain for one year data on the source and destination of a communication; the beginning, duration, and end of a communication; the type of communication; terminal equipment identification; and the location of the customer's mobile terminal equipment. While these data can be accessed by intelligence agencies without court permission, a court order is required to access the contents of these communications.

In some rural areas, wireless technologies (WiMAX, LMDS, Satellite, HSDPA, ...) are used to provide wired- like services, the main provider of these services is Iberbanda (a Telef√≥nica subsidiary like Movistar), there are also other companies like San Pedro Wifi who are not part of the Telef√≥nica monopoly. Typically San Pedro Wifi can offer speeds over 100 Mbit/s. Virtually all wired connections are unmetered. Most broadband lines include free phone calls to land-lines within Spain and some include limited calls to mobile phones. Movistar offers 600Mbs asymmetrical in many cities throughout Spain. The most common speed in Spain is 100 Mbit/s as it is the default offer from Movistar, the main broadband supplier in the country. Clients of other DSL companies usually have higher speeds sold as \\"M√°xima velocidad\\" (maximum speed) or \\"Hasta 200 megas\\" (up to 200 Mbit/s); in those offers the speed of the connection depends on the quality of the line (length of the wire, attenuation, noise) as those speeds are just at the limit of the ADSL2+ technology. Jazztel gets better results with its \\"Hasta 300 megas\\" (up to 300 Mbit/s) because that connection works with VDSL. In opposition to those unguaranteed offers, Ono, the main cable provider, sells its connections as \\"x megas reales\\" (x true Mbps). The main providers are: * Movistar - Former state telecom monopoly. * Orange * Vodafone * M√ÅSM√ìVIL * Euskaltel Movistar, Vodafone, Orange and Euskaltel are the main providers offering TV packages with their broadband.  Mobile broadband  The use of mobile networks for Internet access is important due to the high penetration of smart and mobile phones in Spain. The use of USB devices for computers to connect to mobile networks is also common and some fixed broadband providers offer them for free or at low cost for use on holidays. People usually use flat rates for Internet with limits depending on the price, once that limit is reached, the speed falls from ~7 Mbit/s to ~128 kbit/s (depending on the provider) or the client pays for the extra amount of data downloaded. There are three 2G (GSM) networks, four 3G (UMTS, HDSPA, HSUPA, etc...) networks and LTE networks are being deployed. Nearly all of Spain is covered by at least UMTS. The main providers are: * Movistar - Former state telecom monopoly. * Orange * Vodafone * M√ÅSM√ìVIL Internet censorship in Spain There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or, as of 2012, reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.\\"Spain\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 22 March 2013.

In 2014, for example, the Spanish version of Google News was shut down as continued operation would have required it to pay fees for each news link that it aggregates. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights. The law prohibits, subject to judicial oversight, actions including public speeches and the publication of documents that the government interprets as glorifying or supporting terrorism. The law provides that persons who provoke discrimination, hatred, or violence against groups or associations for racist; anti-semitic; or other references to ideology, religion or belief, family status, membership within an ethnic group or race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, illness, or disability may be punished with imprisonment for one to three years. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence and the government generally respects these prohibitions.

In 2009 the EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media, Viviane Reding, warned Spain against cutting off the Internet access of content pirates without a judicial proceeding. She said, \\"If Spain cuts off Internet access without a procedure in front of a judge, it would certainly run into conflict with the European Commission\\" and \\"Repression alone will certainly not solve the problem of Internet piracy; it may in many ways even run counter to the rights and freedoms which are part of Europe's values since the French Revolution.\\"\\"Reding warns Spain against internet cut-off\\", Reporters Without Borders, 3 December 2009.

And since 29 March 2015 the site is blocked on multiple URLs from all ISPs. On 13 September 2017, the Civil Guard seized referendum.cat, a Catalan website promoting the Catalan independence referendum, pursuant to an order by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia, as the country has considered the referendum to be illegal. The Guard subsequently obtained orders to seize other .cat domains hosting mirrors of the referendum website, and later on 23 September 2017, an order for all ISPs to block any website publicized by Catalan politicians as mirrors of the referendum website. Also censored was an HTTP gateway for the InterPlanetary File System‚Äîa distributed file system that had been used to mirror the materials. On 10 October 2017, the Spanish Civil Guard blocked access to Whats-app groups of several pro-Catalan independence groups. As of December 2017, all previously blocked sites have once again been unblocked, with the focus shifting to taking the sites down directly.

Children and teenagers sing these songs and dance as they go to various homes in their community, collecting money, sweets and food and giving blessings for prosperity. Bhailo is generally sung by girls, while Deusi is sung by boys. At the end of these songs, the woman of the house serves food and gives money to these Deusi/Bhailo singers and dancers. In return, the Deusi/Bhailo team gives blessings for high income and prosperity.  Origin  The exact origin of the Deusi-Bhailo tradition is not very clear. However, the Deusi and Bhailo songs indicate that this tradition is related to King Mahabali, since the lyrics of the songs says \\"We were sent by King Bali\\". The word \\"deusurey\\" used in the songs could be a conjunction of two words \\"Dev\\" and \\"Asur\\". King Mahabali had a mixed Dev and Asur lineage. He was the great grandson of the Asura king Hiranyakshipu, the grandson of Prahlada and the son of Virochana. Also, the word \\"deusire\\" (variation of \\"deusurey\\") used in the songs could be broken down as \\"deu\\", which means \\"give\\" in Nepali, and \\"sire,\\" which is the Sanskrit word for \\"head\\". So deusire could mean to offer one's head for a greater cause or in other words sacrifice oneself. According to the Puranas, King Bali gave his own head to Vamana, the fifth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. King Bali was performing the Ashwamedhya Yajna, when Vamana approached Bali and asked for land that would equal three strides he took. Bali was known for giving alms to any one who came to his palace. Bali agreed to fulfill his demand. To Bali's great surprise, Vamana covered the Earth and the Universe with two steps, and then asked him where he should place his third step. Bali offered his own head. Lord Vishnu, seeing the devotion of Bali, blessed him and raised to him to Suthala, the supreme position in heaven. For his sacrifice, Bali gained Lord Vishnu's favour and also attained salvation.  Entertainment  The Deusi/Bhailo programme provides cultural entertainment by a group of men and/or women who move around their local area singing the Deusi/Bhailo song and other songs. The group is usually composed of a lead chanter/singer and a chorus group and sometimes additional participants such as musicians and dancers. The lead chanter/singer wishes blessings upon the owners of the house where the team visits. Traditionally, the programme is all live and uses minimal electronic instruments. The entire programme can last from about 10 minutes to half an hour in one house. Then the group moves to another location to perform. The programme is held on the third and fourth days of Tihar, where Bhailo is performed on the third day (Laxmi Puja) and Deusi is performed on the fourth day (Gowardhan Puja).

His father encouraged him to take on law studies at the National Chengchi University but after a year, he switched majors to journalism. Graduating with a degree in journalism, Lin was drafted into the army with an office job in communications in Taipei. At an early age, Lin showed great interest in writing and reading. He published his first story in United Daily News at the age of fourteen. At the age of eighteen, he was engaged as one of the contract writers for Crown, one of Taiwan's biggest magazines. In 1969, his story entitled Cicada that narrated the theme of Taiwanese \\"Lost Generation\\" gained popularity amongst the younger generation. This love for reading and writing would later help him conceptualise his artistic vision in his works. For example, he was greatly influenced by Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace while composing his notable work, Legacy. Later, he would inculcate a love for reading in his dance company by giving the dancers each a book in between practices and performances and engage in book discussions with them. =Encountering dance= Lin was first introduced to dance at the age of five, when he saw the British film The Red Shoes. He was so mesmerized with the movie that he began dancing for his family. His interest piqued further after he saw a performance by American Jos√© Lim√≥n Dance Company in Taichung. In the 1960s, when modern dance was gaining popularity in Taiwan, Lin enrolled in a dance studio but gave up after three months as he felt he could not learn much from it. Later on, Lin attended workshops by renowned dancers such as Chungliang Al Huang and Yen Lo-Wong. In 1969, Lin left for the United States on a scholarship to study journalism at the University of Missouri. At Missouri, he received a fellowship to the University of Iowa‚Äôs International Writing Program to study under renowned poet, Paul Engle. At UI, he participated actively in theatre and fine arts. He also attended a Modern Dance course taught by Marcia Thayer. Lin would later on refer to her strong passion and dedication to the art of dance as an important influence. It is from this increased involvement in dance and fine arts that he sharpened his interest and enrolled in a summer course at Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance in New York, where he would later on spend most of his time upon receiving his master's degree from Iowa to hone his artistic skills and knowledge. Career When Lin returned to Taiwan in the 1970s, he started writing and choreographing as well as teaching at the National Chengchi University and the Chinese Cultural University. In 1983, he created the Department of Dance at Taipei National University of the Arts and since 2000, he has been serving as the Artistic Director of the Novel Dance Series for the Novel Hall dance venue in Taipei. =Cloud Gate Dance Theater= In 1973, he founded the Cloud Gate Dance Theater. Since its inauguration, Lin has served as the company‚Äôs founder, resident choreographer as well as its artistic director. He disbanded the group in October 1988, traveled to India, Indonesia, and New York University, before returning to Taiwan in 1990 to restart the troupe. Following the continued success of the company, he founded Cloud Gate 2 in 1999. His intention was to form a Chinese dance group to perform works composed and choreographed by Chinese for the Chinese audience. This formed the vision of the dance group in the early years, as Lin would later call it \\"a very Chinese period\\". This was an important period as Lin created a heightened interest in the Chinese community for modern dance. His formation of the dance company came at a moment when his country was in the midst of developing and defining its own identity through culture and the arts and his repertoire gave the Taiwanese people an artistic source to the understanding of their identity. =International success= As the Cloud Gate Dance Theater gained international popularity, the demand for Lin's artistic directions and masterwork increased as well. He collaborated with many international artists and dance groups. He worked with world- renowned stage designer Ming Cho Lee to conceptualize the scenography of Nine Songs in 1993. He also worked with the world-famous Sylvie Guillem and Akram Khan on Sacred Monsters in 2006. Furthermore, in 1996, he debuted as an opera director in the production of Rashomon. However, despite his international success, Lin remains deeply rooted in Taiwan, refusing a position to direct a major European dance company. He said, \\"How could I leave Taiwan? It is where all my friends and family are. It is out of this that I create\\". Aesthetics and stylistic innovations Lin often assimilates old forms of dance with contemporary style and interpretation. He has composed many original works as well as modified and adapted classical works from Peking opera. He incorporates different art forms into his pieces and marries Western and Eastern aesthetics and style into a distinct fusion signature of the Cloud Gate Company. He is famous for his ability to seamlessly integrate different styles such as ballet, traditional Chinese opera, Buddhist meditation and martial arts like tai chi as well as Taiwanese aborigines ritual dance into his choreographic works. He immerses himself in the study of Asian culture, such as studying court dance in Seoul in 1975 as well as spending quality time throughout his career in Bali to observe local rituals and ceremonies. Furthermore, most of his works would include themes that relate closely to Taiwan. At the beginning of his career, he was deeply concerned with political changes in his home country and he was also aware of the rise of Taiwanese consciousness. He felt responsible to compose pieces to reflect Taiwan‚Äôs history as this also intimately relate to his own past and upbringing. He draws inspiration from diverse sources of artistic styles to create unique contemporary dance movements that reflected Taiwan society's complexity. The dynamic Chinese and Japanese experiences of his family (and Taiwan's colonial past), his western education in the United States as well as his vast knowledge on Asian and Taiwanese Aboriginal traditional cultures and rituals all contributed significantly in helping him form his artistic vision of Taiwan. =Notable work: Legacy (1978)= The masterpiece, Legacy, is the \\"first theatrical presentation of the history of Taiwan\\". The choreography depicts the history of early pioneers who traveled to Taiwan to build a new life on the island. Stylistically, Lin seamlessly combined acrobatics, gymnastics as well as traditional Chinese dance movements to recreate the nation's story on stage. What are ordinary physical laborer's actions of ploughing in the field and harvesting rice are artistically stylised. Legacy was composed at a time when political tensions between the United States, China and Taiwan were high. Coincidentally, it premiered on 16 December 1978 when President Jimmy Carter announced the end of diplomatic ties between the United States and Taipei. It was out of this fragile political environment that Legacy was debuted. Thus, Legacy struck a deep chord and left an indelible mark in Taiwan as people searched intensely for their Taiwanese identity. Personal life Lin is openly gay and in a long-term relationship with Taiwanese writer and artist Chiang Xun. They live together in an apartment complex close to the Tamsui River in the Bali District of New Taipei City.

The station broadcasts a regional Mexican music format. KMLA is owned by Gold Coast Radio, LLC. History KMLA first signed on in October 1996. Owner Clayton Corp. sold the station to Gold Coast Radio LLC for $600,000 the following month; the transaction was consummated December 6. On October 30, 2008, KMLA owner Gold Coast Radio faced rival radio company Lazer Broadcasting in Ventura County Superior Court, suing for unspecified damages. Gold Coast accused the defendant of interfering with its advertisers and customers to harm its business, beginning with the near-cancellation of a 2007 concert hosted by KMLA. Lazer filed a countercomplaint requesting an injunction to stop Gold Coast from claiming that KMLA is the number-one rated station in Ventura County, citing Arbitron ratings reports to the contrary. On November 6, a jury awarded $553,000 in damages to Gold Coast Radio and promoter Universo Musical. However, on November 20, Superior Court judge Henry Walsh agreed with Lazer's counterclaim, granting the injunction prohibiting Gold Coast from making false and misleading claims of having the top-rated station. On January 7, 2009, Walsh set aside the jury award and ordered a retrial, citing insufficient evidence presented by the plaintiffs; the second jury granted Gold Coast and Universo Musical a smaller award of $99,800 on August 28. On July 1, 2016 at midnight, Gold Coast Radio began operating KURQ in Grover Beach, California under a local marketing agreement with El Dorado Broadcasters, dropping the pre-existing modern rock format and simulcasting KMLA.

Sir Alfred Biliotti (14 July 1833 ‚Äì 1915) was a levantine Italian who joined the British Foreign Service and eventually rose to become one of its most distinguished consular officers in the late 19th century. Biliotti was the eldest of seven children of Vice-Consul Charles Biliotti, who was born in Livorno and later moved to Rhodes. He became a naturalised citizen in 1872.UK, Naturalisation Certificates and Declarations, 1870‚Äì1916 Biliotti was also an accomplished archaeologist who conducted important excavations at sites in the Aegean, western Anatolia, and eastern Anatolia. He was made a Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George in October 1898. Biliotti's despatches, though written in slightly poor English, are recognized as being of major value for 21st century scholars in fields as different as diplomatic history, anthropology, and of course archaeology. He served as British vice-consul at Rhodes and was transferred to Trebizond in 1873; later he was consul at Chania (Crete) and consul-general at Salonica. His service in Crete covered the period of the revolutionary movements of 1889, 1895 and 1897, in all of which Britain was concerned as one of the Great Powers. His service at Salonica saw the beginnings of the guerilla warfare which would eventually lead to the Balkan Wars. He excavated at Camirus (1858‚Äì1865), Ialysus (1868‚Äì1870), Satala (1874) and Cirisli Tepe (1883).

It was one of the three ancient Doric cities in the island, and one of the six towns constituting the Doric hexapolis. It was situated only six stadia to the south-west of the city of Rhodes, and it would seem that the rise of the latter city was the cause of the decay of Ialysus; for in the time of Strabo it existed only as a village. Pliny the Elder did not consider it as an independent place at all, but imagined that Ialysus was the ancient name of Rhodes. Orychoma, the citadel, was situated above Ialysus, and still existed in the time of Strabo.

Originally designed by Herbert A. Simon and Edward Feigenbaum to simulate phenomena in verbal learning, it has been later adapted to account for data on the psychology of expertise and concept formation. It was influential in formalizing the concept of a chunk. In EPAM, learning consists in the growth of a discrimination network. EPAM was written in IPL/V. The project was started in the late 1950s with the aim to learn nonsense syllables. The term nonsense is used because the learned patterns are not connected with a meaning but they are standing for their own. The software is working internally by creating a decision tree.

It is in the town of Hatfield. It grew up on the Great North Road , one days journey from London by horse or coach and once had many coaching inns. It was a convenient place for the Bishops of Ely to have a lodging, giving access to both the cathedral in Ely to the north and the capital to the south. A village grew up adjacent to the estate of Bishops palace. The parish church of St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield was named by the Bishops after their patron saint √Üthelthryth . A market was once held in Fore Street. When Hatfield was developed as a new town after World War Two, Old Hatfield was deliberately left unspoilt by development and through traffic and so retains an historic feel.  History  Old Hatfield is the result of the houses and farms which have been established near a place of worship featured by a few religious buildings by the Monks . In fact, in 970, King Edgar the Peaceful and his wife had inherited the estate from √Üthelflaed's parents. The place is very attractive, there are arable lands, forests and a river , some marshes bring a natural boundary against enemy. They give it to the Monks against the promise to build a church. British History Academy Sainte Ethelreda 's church Over the years, needs evolve at the same time as a village gets bigger and grows up with new religious buildings. Over the years, and during 4 centuries, successively the site has belonged to the Monks, to the Abbots and to the Bishop of Ely until John Morton (cardinal) who builds there in 1485, near a parish church named St Etheldreda what is going to become Bishop Hatfield. British History Academy Hatfield Palace The construction made of red bricks bearing a timber roof, according to medieval architectural style, is a quadrilateral featured by four wings with a yard inside. It is known that the estate was attended by the royal family since Henry VII of England and later his son, Henry VIII of England who decided to use the manor as the royal nursery. In 1538, he exchanged the estate with Thomas Goodrich, Bishop of Ely, against bishoprics located in Cambridgeshire and Essex that he had seized before during the Reformation's very first laws. Then all later Tudor dynastic rulers would attend this manor, then better known as Hatfield Palace. The Stuart dynasty's first sovereign, James VI and I, in 1607, was to exchange Hatfield Palace against Theobalds House, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury's house. North facing view of Hatfield House He decided to wreck three wings of the building and use the bricks to construct Cecil's new house which was named as Hatfield House, a Jacobean architectural style construction.

She served in the Napoleonic Wars and was decommissioned in 1815. After conversion to a 76-gun ship in 1817 she circumnavigated the world, visiting Australia. She was cut down to a single decker 50-gun frigate in 1840 and was decommissioned in 1846. She was lent as a boys' training ship to The Marine Society and was lost to fire in 1876. Design and construction After a long delay due to shortage of timber, Warspite was launched on 16 November 1807 at Chatham and commissioned by Sir Henry Blackwood, Admiral Lord Nelson's ‚Äòfavourite frigate captain‚Äô. She was designed by Sir John Henslow as one of the large class 74s, and was the second, and last, ship of a class of two (the other being ).Winfield (2004) p. 40 As a large '74', she carried 24-pdrs on her upper gun deck instead of the 18-pdrs found on the middling and common class 74s. Napoleonic Wars Warspite spent three years between 1807 and 1810 playing a supporting role in the Peninsular War. She took part in the long blockade of Toulon in 1810. She then joined the Channel Fleet, protecting British trade while intercepting French and American ships. During early 1813 Warspite took a couple of lucrative ‚Äòprizes‚Äô including a US schooner bound for Philadelphia ‚Äòwith brandy, wine, silks, etc.,‚Äô from France. In June 1814 her name appears for the first time on the North American and West Indies Station, when she carried reinforcements to Quebec; the first 74-gun ship to go so far up the Saint Lawrence River, under Captain Lord James O'Brien.Marshall, John, Royal Naval Biography, Vol. IV - Part II, Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1835, p. 137 76-gun ship of the line Henry Moses She was paid off in 1815 only to be recommissioned in 1817 when she was modified to carry 76 guns. At the same time her stern was altered and she was given diagonal bracing on the framing introduced by Sir Robert Seppings. In 1825 she sailed from Portsmouth with Rear Admiral Philip Woodehouse as the new commanding officer of the West Indies station. During 1826-27 she circumnavigated the World under Captain William Parker,Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 72, Navy Records Society (Great Britain), London, 1934, p. 254 but bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Gage, departing from Spithead for India. At Trincomalee Rear-Admiral Gage was replaced by Commodore Sir James Brisbane as the new South Atlantic (Rio de Janeiro) Station commander-in-chief. However, following Commodore Brisbane's death from a contracted tropical disease, Captain Richard Saunders Dundas of the accompanying 6th rate Survey ship HMS Volage took command for the rest of the voyage which saw Warspite as the first ship of the line to visit Port Jackson in the colony of New South Wales in Australia.William R. O‚ÄôByrne, A Naval Biographical Dictionary - Volume 3, p.1126 Returning to the station with the Malta squadron late in 1828 she was detached to transport Count Capo d'Istria, President of the Greek republic, to various locations around the Eastern Mediterranean while blockading Navarino, Modon and Coron in coordination with the French and Russian allied squadrons. In this capacity it helped to interdict two Egyptian corvettes at Navarino, one suffering substantial damage when it ignored warning shots and was engaged with the main battery. Captain Parker then participated in several conferences with Ibrahim Pasha to negotiate the withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Greece.George Thomas Keppel Albemarle (Earl of), Narrative of a journey across the Balcan, Volume 1, H.

Training for about 150 boys at a time was conducted over about 10 months to provide basic seaman knowledge, including of ship lore, rigging and discipline, sufficient to be employed as Boy Seaman in either the Royal Navy or the merchant marine. On 6 August 1863 she was struck by the Russian ironclad Pervenets while the latter was undergoing sea trials.

His great-uncle Stephen George Comyn had been naval chaplain to the English Admiral Lord Nelson. He was educated at Merchant Taylor's School, and Dulwich College and subsequently founded his own shipping company - Comyn Singleton and Dunn of Gracechurch Street London EC1. Through this business he went to California where he settled and became a businessman in San Francisco. His father in law William Emil Gerber of Sacramento, California was a merchant and financier, and may have supported his enterprises.Sacramento County Biographies William Emil Gerber One of the ships he built was a five master sailing ship named Ann Comyn after his wife. During World War I Leslie Comyn, tried to persuade the United States Shipping Board (USSB) that they should build concrete ships. They were not convinced so in 1917, he founded the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company at Oakland, California. In January 1918 he started, on speculation, to build the first ship, called appropriately \\"FAITH\\" designed by Alan MacDonald and Victor Poss. The ship was an 8000-ton freighter, and, at the time, the largest concrete vessel with a sea-going capability in the world. The ship was launched successfully in March 1918.New York Times Mar 15, 1918 BIG CONCRETE SHIP AFLOAT IN PACIFICTimes Monday March 18, 1918 U. S. War Activities The Turning-Point Following this, on April 12, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson approved the Emergency Fleet Corporation program which oversaw the construction of 24 ferrocement ships for the war. In May 1918, Faith left San Francisco on her maiden voyage, with 4300 tons of salt and copper ore, bound for Vancouver, followed by other voyages to Honolulu, Balboa, Callao, Valparaiso and New York. In 1919 Comyn's shipbuilding company sold the ship to the French-American SS Lines. Comyn was founder President of the \\"W L Comyn & Co\\" shipping companyGuide to the California business records, 1918-1932 and had an interest in other companies (for example Snow's Import Export). The company is widely quoted in shipping law from the case \\"Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog V. Signal Oil & Gas Co. of, 310 U.S. 268 (1940)\\".FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code The question concerned is whether the Standard Oil were entitled to maritime liens for fuel oil delivered to Dannebrog's vessels. Dannebrog had chartered two ships - the 'Stjerneborg' and the 'Brand' - to W. L. Comyn & Sons in May 1933. Standard Oil had previously modified a contract with Anglo Canadian Shipping to include the fuel oil requirements of vessels owned, chartered or operated by W. L. Comyn & Sons. Family Comyn married Ann Gerber, daughter of William Gerber, and had three children. His brother Hugh Comyn was a Wimbledon singles entrant in 1906 and 1907 as well as a Scottish Open (badminton) champion in 1908 and 1909.

He was born at Great Harwood, near Whalley in Lancashire, England, the second son of William Brooks. In 1815 he became a partner in his father‚Äôs Blackburn-based business, Cunliffe Brooks & Co. This business supplied cotton Sayers, R. S. (1957) Lloyds Bank in the History of English Banking. London: OUP; p. 331 and/or textile equipment,Brackenbury and also ran a bank as a sideline. Around 1819 his father set up Samuel and his two brothers as junior partners in three separate firms of calico printers in Manchester. Samuel opened a small branch of his father‚Äôs bank in a corner of his warehouse. Gradually, banking became his principal activity, and in 1826 the bank moved to its own premises. It soon became established as one of Manchester‚Äôs leading banks. In 1900 it was absorbed by Lloyd's Bank to provide them with a presence in the Manchester area.Sayers, R. S. (1957) Lloyds Bank in the History of English Banking. London: OUP; pp. 12, 14, 147, 281 and 331 Subsequently Brooks established the first housing estates in Whalley Range (which he named) and Brooklands (which acquired its name from common usage). William Cunliffe Brooks was the son of Samuel Brooks and his wife Margaret, n√©e Hall, daughter of Thomas Hall. Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1881 Manchester and Leeds Railway In 1830, Brooks chaired the first meeting of the promoters of the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;). Subsequently he became its first deputy chairman.Marshall, John (1970) The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, Vol. 2. Newton Abbot: David and Charles; quoted by BrackenburyWells, Jeffrey (2000), The Eleven Towns Railway: The Story of the Manchester and Leeds Main Line, pages 11, 71 Railway and Canal Historical Society Initially the M&LR; placed its Manchester terminus at Oldham Road but they had a firm plan to establish a station more centrally. Samuel Brooks had purchased land at Hunt's Bank and in August 1838 he informed the board that,\\"...if you require any portion of that land, you shall have it on reasonable terms\\". He went on to pledge that the company would not be prejudiced by his holding the land, and that he had offers in hand but would not sell until he knew the board's intentions. The board gratefully accepted this offer. So the company were able to build Manchester Victoria station a few years later. Whalley Range In 1836 he bought Jackson‚Äôs Moss, a swampy area south of the city centre. He drained it and built villas for wealthy businessmen such as himself. The house he built for himself was named Whalley House and the area acquired the name Whalley Range probably after his boyhood home. Tollbars guarded this exclusive area and the site of one of them is still called \\"Brooks‚Äôs Bar\\" though simplified in local pronunciation to Brooks' Bar (with long \\"oo\\"). Here is the Whalley Hotel on the corner of Withington Road and Upper Chorlton Road. The pub has closed, although the building remains standing, and will be developed. Brooklands In 1856, Samuel bought a vast area of land in North Cheshire from the Earl of Stamford and made further purchases later. He enhanced its value by draining, scrub clearance and tree planting. The area was crossed by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, opened in 1849. His son William continued to purchase and develop the area until the estate stretched from Davenport Green to Warburton Green and included much of Hale Barns and of what soon became known as Brooklands. =Railway station= A road crossed this railway between Sale and Timperley stations, and in 1855, 45 residents petitioned for a station there. The company took no action but in 1859, Brooks negotiated terms for a station. He offered an acre of land for ¬£200, and guaranteed to pay the company ¬£300 if annual receipts had not reached ¬£100 after five years. The unofficial name \\"Brooks‚Äôs land\\" soon became Brooklands, and the station so named opened there on 1 December 1859. Annual receipts reached ¬£100 after two years. =Private road (Brooklands Road etc.)= As at Whalley Range, so at Brooklands he built a private road in 1862 with land available for superior residences. This road was four miles long and led to the station. It was wide and tree lined, with a sound stone foundation. From Brooklands Station it led straight in a south-easterly direction for 2 ¬Ω miles. This part is called Brooklands Road on the 1872 six inch map. It crossed the Stockport-Altrincham turnpike (now the A560) and two minor roads: Dobbinetts Lane and Whitecarr lane. This was called Hale Road. It then used Roaring Gate Lane to Davenport Green before providing a further new road (Ashley Road) to the Altrincham- Wilmslow road (now the A538) in the village of Hale. The name Brooks‚Äôs road gradually became accepted for Hale Road and Ashley Road. It can easily be followed today (2007). Samuel did not live to see this road completed but it was completed by his son William. Beyond the immediate vicinity of Brooklands, most of this road was not used for development. It may have been made for Samuel‚Äôs own convenience in travelling around his estate. Since World War II, development has been restricted by planning laws and some of the road still passes through greenbelt agricultural land. Other parts are likely to be developed in the near future. Brooks died in 1864. He had married Margaret Hall, daughter of Thomas Hall, and had a son William, who became an MP and was made a baronet.

It follows the career of Yevgeni Yeremin, an orphan of Stalingrad, from his days as a MiG-15 pilot in the Korean War to his later years as a cosmonaut. Plot The novel follows Yevgeni Yeremin, first as an orphan and then his time as a fighter pilot in the Korean War, where he crashes in a plane bearing USSR insignia. Although rescued by North Korean troops he is felt to have risked revealing that Soviet aircrew participated in the conflict and on cessation of hostilities he is exiled in disgrace to a polar base. He has been befriended by one of his groundcrew, (throughout referred to as 'The Widow'), who follows him north, and he eventually marries her. He becomes a trainee cosmonaut, with little hope of a mission; he eventually volunteers for a risky mission to attempt a lunar landing ahead of Apollo 11, in an untested lunar craft. He knows that if he fails, his death will lead to little comment, and be denied by the USSR. He succeeds in achieving a landing, on the far side of the Moon, but the lander rocket has malfunctioned, leaving him no hope of return. The novel ends with his descending from the doomed craft to walk on the lunar surface, as the lights in the stranded craft gradually go out.

But the character himself is a cipher, a prop to build a plot around. The protagonist never quite comes alive, and so neither does the novel.\\" Publishers Weekly had similar thoughts on the character of Yeremin saying \\"too many details of training pad out a short book, and nothing in it really tells us enough about Yeremin to make us care what happens to him.\\" Adaptations The novel was serialised in 10 episodes in the BBC's Book at Bedtime in August 2007.

He later became a successful breeding stallion siring the Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic. Background Summer Squall was sired by Storm Bird, a son of 1964 Northern Dancer, \\"one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history.\\" His dam was Weekend Surprise, who was also the dam of 1992 United States Horse of the Year A.P. Indy. Weekend Surprise's dam Lassie Dear was also the direct female-line ancestor of Duke of Marmalade, Lemon Drop Kid and Ruler of the World. Bred and born on the land that became Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, by W.S. Farish III & W.S. Kilroy, Summer Squall was trained by Neil J. Howard and ridden by National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame jockey Pat Day. Racing career Racing at age two, Summer Squall went undefeated in all five of his starts. As a three-year-old in 1990, he became known for his rivalry with Unbridled. They met six times at ages three and four, with Summer Squall winning three of those races, including the Blue Grass Stakes, and finished ahead of Unbridled in one other, the 1991 Pimlico Special. At Kentucky Derby post time, Summer Squall was sent off as the bettors' second choice behind Mister Frisky, a colt from Puerto Rico who had won a record sixteen straight races coming into the Derby including victories in California in the San Rafael and San Vicente Stakes and the important Grade I Santa Anita Derby. Running six lengths back, Summer Squall made a move as the field turned into the stretch for home but Unbridled came with him, then pulled away to win. Pleasant Tap finished third with Mister Frisky eighth. Summer Squall won the Preakness Stakes by 2 lengths. In beating Unbridled, his 18 seconds for the final 3/16 of a mile was the fastest in Preakness history. Summer Squall had bled quite a bit during his racing in Florida and required Lasix to deal with the problem. However, Lasix was still banned in New York in 1990, so he did not race in the Belmont Stakes, in which rival Unbridled finished fourth without the use of Lasix. Summer Squall went on to win the Grade II Pennsylvania Derby with the use of Lasix, but he bled again while finishing off the board and far back in the Meadowlands Cup. Summer Squall competed at age four in 1991, and though he never won another Grade I, he won the Fayette Handicap; then in Chicago at Arlington Park, he ran second to Black Tie Affair in the Washington Park Handicap. He also finished second to Farma Way in the then-Grade I Pimlico Special. Retirement Summer Squall was a ridgling, meaning that he had an undescended testicle. However, this did not preclude him being used at stud. He stood at Lane's End Farm until he was pensioned in 2004 due to fertility problems. He was euthanized in September 2009 from infirmities of old age. The sire of thirty-five stakes winners, Summer Squall produced offspring that included: * Charismatic - 1999 Kentucky Derby winner, 1999 American Horse of the Year * Storm Song - won 1996 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly * Summer Colony - millionaire filly, multiple stakes winner including the Grade I Personal Ensign Handicap * Summer Mis - 2003 Illinois Horse of the Year Summer Squall is also the damsire of Stevie Wonderboy and of Summer Bird, winner of the 2009 Belmont Stakes.

Franz Boos was an Austrian botanist who, with Franz Bredemeyer, made up Emperor Joseph II's gardening team. Boos and his assistant Georg Scholl, were collecting Cape plants for the imperial gardens. These collections were transported to Vienna by Nicolas Thomas Baudin, who had been carefully briefed by Boos on the techniques used for keeping plants and animals alive on long ship voyages. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae (subfamily Amaryllidoideae) and its specific name shows that Jacquin felt it resembled an Amaryllis. H. amarylloides is usually found in seasonally-inundated hollows at about 600 m altitude, between Springbok and Grootvlei in Namaqualand, and along the Bokkeveld Mountains escarpment to Gifberg near Vanrhynsdorp. It has a cone- shaped inflorescence of pale to dark pink flowers appearing from May to October. The two annual leaves are strap-shaped to broadly elliptical, carried erect or flat on the ground. Slight differences between the Gifberg and Vanrhyns Pass populations, support the notion of two subspecies for now, but finding intermediate forms may revert the taxon to a single, variable species. The name \\"Haemanthus amarylloides\\" was repeatedly applied in error to specimens of a similar-looking species from the summer rainfall region.

The Portuguese name refers to Serra de Aires, a mountain near Montforte in the Alentejo region (sometimes mistaken for the Serra d'Aire, a range of hills or mountains marking the boundary between Ribatejo and Oeste, north of the Tagus river). The breed is nicknamed ('macaque dog', 'monkey dog') for its furry face and lively attitude.  Appearance  Portuguese Sheepdog is a medium-sized dog, standing 45 to 55 cm (17¬Ω to 21¬Ω ins) at the withers for males (females slightly smaller) and 17 to 27 kg (37 to 60 lbs) in weight. The dog's body is long and has a long coat without an undercoat, of medium thickness and described as having a \\"goat like\\" texture.Original Standard in Portuguese from the Portuguese Kennel Club:Estal√£o Do C√£o Da Serra De Aires ; or in English translation from the FCI Breed Standard from the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale The lack of an undercoat makes the dog less resistant to extreme weather as a working dog. Typical coat colours include yellow, chestnut, grey, fawn, wolf grey (), and black, with tan marks. White hairs may be mixed in with the coat, but there should be no large white patches. The tail should be long, and a natural bobtail is a disqualification under the breed standard, meaning that owners are discouraged from breeding such non typical dogs, and tailless dogs cannot compete for breed championships. The tail should never be docked. The drop (hanging) ears are set high and close to the head. Detailed descriptions of all of the ideal proportions and colours are listed in the original breed standard, as well as faults which are aspects not typical for the breed or that are structural problems.  History  Head of a C√£o da Serra de Aires living in Poland Ancestors of the modern breed were traditionally used for herding cows, sheep, goats, horses, and even pigsAnnotated Breed Standard (in Portuguese, from the Portuguese breed club, Clube Portugu√™s do C√£o da Serra de Aires) in the Serra de Aires and in the Alentejo.United Kennel Club breed standard As with other breeds who came from undocumented, working dog origins, \\"... data is rare, or does not exist ... most guardian and herding breeds do not have records before 1900\\".C√£o de Castro Laboreiro History (in Portuguese) Retrieved 4 October 2008 The dog is recognisable as one of the old-fashioned types of European sheepdogs, believed to be closely related to the Pyrenean and Catalan Sheepdogs. It is also believed to be descended from Briards imported into Portugal in the early 1900s by the Conde de Castro Guimar√£es from Cascais, and crossed with the Pyrenean Sheepdog.FCI Breed Standard The landscape of the Serra de Aires is barren and harsh and it has been noted that the breed would have had a difficult time adapting to the climate there.Breed Origins from the Portuguese breed club (in Portuguese) The first breed standard was written by Antonio Cabral and Felipe Morgado Romeiros and was accepted by the Portuguese Kennel Club. The breed was recognised internationally in 1996 by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, under the name Portuguese Sheepdog in English. The breed has been exported to other countries, and has become a popular companion and pet in Europe. In the United States, the breed is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Herding group as of 2006, also under the name Portuguese Sheepdog. It is also recognised and listed under its original name or various translations by minor kennel clubs, specialty clubs, and Internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.  Related Portuguese breeds  The Portuguese Sheepdog is a regional herding breed, and in other areas of the country the Saint Miguel Cattle Dog, Estrela Mountain Dog, Castro Laboreiro Dog and Rafeiro do Alentejo traditionally did similar work herding livestock in other mountain areas of the country. Nowadays, most of them are kept as pets.  Health  No recurring health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. They are prone to ehrlichiosis transmitted by ticks. Abdominal tumors are to be expected on senior dogs, so regular echograms are advised after the eighth year of life. =Temperament= The FCI breed standard states that the ideal Portuguese Sheepdog is \\"exceptionally intelligent and very lively.\\" =Activities= Portuguese Sheepdogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Portuguese Sheepdogs exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

The church distanced itself from the Quaker denomination; it is much more conservative than most Quaker churches, and does not espouse the pacifist views of most Quakers. In 2008, took the name of Yorba Linda Friends Church.

It consists of N-acetyllactosamine synthase and alpha-lactalbumin. Alpha-lactalbumin, which is expressed in response to prolactin, increases the affinity of N-acetyllactosamine synthase for its substrate, causing increased production of lactose during lactation. N-acetyllactosamine synthase falls under the category of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, a type-II membrane protein found in the Golgi. Alpha-lactalbumin is a Ca2+ binding protein specific to mammary glands. Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase consists of the catalytic component and alpha- lactalbumin consists of the regulatory component of lactose synthase. Alpha- lactalbumin promotes glucose binding to beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase. The beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase catalytic component consists of two flexible loops: small loop and large loop. The small loop consists of a Trp residue (Trp314) with surrounding glycine residues, meanwhile the large loop makes up amino acid residues 345 to 365. The Trp residue in the small loop moves allowing for the sugar nucleotide to be locked into the binding site. This causes a conformational change in the large loop which then creates sites for oligosaccharide and metal ion binding, and protein-protein interactions for alpha-lactalbumin.

It consists of four medium-sized, broad-winged species. * European honey buzzard, Pernis apivorus * Crested honey buzzard, Pernis ptilorhynchus * Barred honey buzzard, Pernis celebensis * Philippine honey buzzard, Pernis steerei They breed in temperate and warmer climates of the Old World, and are specialist feeders on wasp larvae. The two temperate species, the European and crested honey buzzards, are migratory. They breed in woodland, and are often inconspicuous except when displaying. The members of this genus have plumage which mimics that of juvenile common buzzards or of Spizaetus hawk-eagles. It has been suggested that the similarity has arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors such as goshawks, which may be wary about attacking what appears to be a better-protected species with stronger bill and talons than the honey buzzards actually possess.

The village of Burghclere, but less so Old Burghclere, was once on the A34 and has now been by-passed, although this section is not really part of the Newbury bypass. Burghclere has been known variously as: Clere Episcopi, Burcler (xiii cent.); Bisshopesclere, Bourghclere, Burghclere (xiv cent.); Boroughclere, Burghcleere, Boroweclere, Burcleare (xvi cent.); Burroughclere, Borough Cleere, and Burgh Cleere (xvii cent.).A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281. Burghclere is a large parish five miles west of Kingsclere, and is immediately adjacent to Highclere, which is on its western boundary. In the heart of Old Burghclere, in centre of the whole Burghclere parish stands the old church of All Saints, and close by is Burghclere Manor House, which was formerly the rectory. Burghclere Farm is north of the old church.The modern church of The Ascension stands on a hill in the north of the parish; near it are the school and the rectory. Earlstone Common and Burghclere Common are in this part of the parish, and east of these commons is the estate of Adbury Park. Earlstone Farm on the northwest side of the river which forms the north-eastern boundary of the parish and Earlstone are south of Earlstone Common, and on the north side of Burghclere Common is the small parish of Newtown, the chapelry of which is annexed to the rectory of Burghclere. Other places of importance in the parish are Heatherwold in the north, Whitway on a hill on the north-west boundary, Wergs one mile north-east of the village and Palmer's Hill. The Methodist chapel, built in 1864 and rebuilt in 1894, is north of Whitway, near the old Newbury road. (A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281.) In 1233 the common fields (campi) of Burghclere comprised Stock (67¬Ω acres), Surlande (31¬Ω acres), Harebert and Leylie (242 acres), Lendecumbe (151 acres), as well as 10 acres of meadow dispersed over the manor. These commons were inclosed in 1783.Some place-names of interest are Le Byle, Erchelreston and Harte (1558), Garstone (14th century), Nochesland and Pilgrims' Farm at Earlstone, which probably derived its name from being on the line of an ancient trackway, a pilgrims' way which leads to Winchester. (A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281.) The southern part of the parish (Old Burghclere) is open down country. Beacon Hill, which is 842 feet above the ordnance datum, is here a conspicuous landmark, upon which are the remains of an ancient earthwork. Down Farm lay east of the hill close to the former Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway run by the Great Western Railway, which ran almost due north from here through the parish. The total acreage of the parish of Burghclere is 5,269 acres, of which 1,740 acres are arable land, 2,174 acres permanent grass and 500 acres woods and plantations (1911). The chief crops are wheat, barley and oats (1911); the soil varies, being chiefly gravel and chalk, the subsoil chalk and greensand.A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281.

The most notable Bishops of Winchester being William of Wykeham (1320 or 1324‚Äì1404), who founded New College, Oxford, and New College School in 1379, and Winchester College in 1382, but also owned, in his own right, Earlstone manor in the parish of Burghclere. William Waynflete, Lord Chancellor of England (1456‚Äì1460) and founder of Magdalen School and College in Oxford was also particularly renowned. In 1551 Edward VI received it from John Ponet, Bishop of Winchester, in exchange for lands elsewhere.A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281. King Edward VI granted it to William FitzWilliam in the same year, 1551, and although, under Philip and Mary, John White, the then Bishop of Winchester, was reinstated in 1557, William Fitz William died seised in 1559, leaving four daughters as his heirs. Of these Mabel, the eldest, was married to Sir Thomas Browne, and Katharine to Christopher Preston, 4th Viscount Gormanston; the two younger, both called Elizabeth, subsequently married Francis Jermy and Innocent Rede (Reade) respectively.A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281. Sir William bequeathed the manor to his wife Jane (died 1575) for life, and after her death to his three younger daughters, whose respective husbands are found each holding a third part; in 1568 Innocent Rede (Reade) and Elizabeth his wife conveyed a third part of the manor to Hugh Hare, in 1569 Francis Jermy was concerned in the conveyance of a third, and in 1576 Christopher Viscount Gormanston held a third. In 1577 Richard Kingsmill (MP) acquired by fines the whole manor which George Kingsmill, his brother, was holding for life at the time of Richard's death in 1600. Constance, only daughter and heir of Richard, married Sir Thomas Lucy, of Charlecote (county Warwicks), whom she survived, and on her death in January 1637 her son Sir Thomas Lucy inherited.In the 17th and 18th centuries mention is made of the rights of free warren, free fishery, court leet and court baron and view of frankpledge, which belonged to the lord of the manor of Burghclere, and in the reign of Elizabeth 'a grievous complaint' was made by the inhabitants of Burghclere and other manors against Richard Kingsmill, 'Surveyour of her Majestie's Court of Wardes and Liveries,' 'concerning the breach of sundry customes, innovacions of tythes, encroachments of pasture, &c.;'(A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281.) In 1647 the manor was in possession of Spencer Lucy son and heir of Sir Thomas, and it passed with Highclere to his brother Richard, who owned the latter manor in 1667, and presented to the church of Burghclere in 1661. Ten years later the property was conveyed to Sir Robert Sawyer, who died seised of the manors of Burghclere and High Clere in 1692, leaving as heiress an only daughter, Margaret wife of Thomas, Earl of Pembroke, ancestor of the Earls of Carnarvon. Burghclere has largely remained in the possession of the same family since this date, Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Carnarvon inheriting by the will of his uncle, the Hon Robert Sawyer Herbert, second son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, and in 1911 was in the hands of George Edward Stanhope, fifth earl.A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume iv, Victoria County History (VCH), London, 1911, pages 277-281.

The Reading Mercury, Saturday, 30 October 1869, reported the building.'BURGHCLERE - Considerable amount of interest has been excited in this locality on the subject of Cheap Dwellings for the Working Classes, owing to a report that the Earl of Carnarvon was about to start the new system of building houses in concrete. His Lordship has already commenced the erection of a block of three cot- tages at Burghclere Bottom, and no doubt the result will be anticipated with much interest both by landed pro- prietors and tenant farmers. This plan, if successful, will settle much controversy as to the predictability of building suitable farm cottages at a cheap rate, as up to this time cottages in brickwork do not afford interest on the capital expended. The work is to be done with Tall's Patent Concrete Machine, and is not expected to cost more than 6L. [¬£6] per rod standard thickness [a rod is 5 meters, or 5.5 yard, 16.5 feet]. Many build- ings of various descriptions have already been erected on this principle throughout the country, and competent judges have pronounced them the exact kind of building that is wanted. They are said to have a neat appearance when completed, and are not only stronger and more durable than brickwork, but warmer and consequently more dry and healthy.'

The fourth U.S. warship to be named for the United States of America, she was delivered in spring of 2014, replacing of the . Her mission is to act as the flagship of an expeditionary strike group or amphibious ready group, carrying part of a Marine expeditionary unit into battle and putting them ashore with helicopters and V-22 Osprey tilt- rotor aircraft, supported by F-35B Lightning II aircraft and helicopter gunships. The ship's design is based on , but to allow more room for aviation facilities she does not have a well deck, and has smaller medical spaces. With a displacement of 45,000 tons, she is as large as many other countries' aircraft carriers and can fulfill similar missions when configured with 20 F-35B strike fighters. Design The design is based on that of , itself an improved version of the . Approximately 45% of the Flight 0 design is based on Makin Island, with the well deck removed to allow more room for aircraft and aviation fuel. The removal of the well deck for landing craft allows for an extended hangar deck with two significantly wider high bay areas, each fitted with an overhead crane for aircraft maintenance. These changes were required in order to operate the F-35B and MV-22, which are considerably larger than the aircraft they replace. The typical aircraft complement is expected to be 12 MV-22B transports, six STOVL F-35B attack aircraft, four CH-53K heavy transport helicopters, seven AH-1Z/UH-1Y attack/utility helicopters and two Navy MH-60S for air-sea rescue. The exact makeup of the ship's aircraft complement will vary according to the mission. America can carry 20 F-35B and 2 MH-60S to serve as a small aircraft carrier as demonstrated by LHD operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Other enhancements include a re- configurable command and control complex, an on-board hospital, additional aviation fuel capacity and numerous aviation support spaces. America will be modified in a similar way to the modifications made on to make her better able to withstand the great amounts of heat generated by the F-35B's engine exhaust when taking off or landing vertically. Intercostal structural members will be added underneath flight deck landing spots seven and nine to more closely perform timed cyclic flight operations without overstressing it. Other changes may involve re-adjusting some ship antennas to allow for a clear flight path. The ship will undergo a 40-week modification period where recently installed piping, lighting, and other features will be removed to weld reinforcements underneath the flight deck; the modification period would have been greater if its construction when in the shipyard had been interrupted to perform it. Such accommodations will be included in all future America-class ships from the start. The America class has an increased aviation capacity to include an enlarged hangar deck, realignment and expansion of the aviation maintenance facilities, a significant increase in available stowage for parts and support equipment and increased aviation fuel capacity. However, the ship's design represents a major departure from past designs and has been the source of considerable controversy, as it lacks the capabilities and multi-role flexibility of traditional amphibious ships, including the ability to launch landing craft and amphibious assault vehicles, such as the AAV-7. Some have even argued that America represents a \\"dead end\\" as an amphibious ship. In fact, the Navy is building only one other ship () to the LHA-6 blueprint. At issue is the focus on aviation capabilities, at the expense of the \\"well deck\\", which is the defining feature of the amphibious fleet and allows Marine Corps amphibious operations. The Marine Corps Commandant and the Chief of Naval Operations have signed an official Memorandum of Agreement that restores the well deck to and subsequent ships, while in 2015 the Commandant of the Marine Corps launched an initiative to ensure aviation platforms do not lead to an imbalance in the MAGTF. History AV-8B Harrier of VMA-311 launches from America during exercises off California in February 2015 The U.S. Navy awarded Northrop Grumman Corporation's Ingalls Shipyard Division a $2.4 billion fixed-price incentive contract for the detailed design and construction of LHA-6, primarily at the company's shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The production decision was made in January 2006 and construction of LHA-6 began in December 2008. Navy Secretary Donald C. Winter announced in June 2008 that the ship would be named America.

Plot The story revolves around Georgia, a Filipina patis (fish sauce) manufacturer and a mother who is finally reunited with her long-lost Filipino Australian daughter after 20 years of separation. Christine can think of 101 reasons why her Australian dad must not marry her mom. The number one reason is that Georgia, her mother, disappeared from her life twenty years ago and never came back. Now Christine is confused: Why does her father want to marry her mom, who had caused them so much heartache? When Christine goes to her mother's town in Malabon, what starts out as an investigation turns out to be a hilarious yet touching journey for both mother and daughter. Christine's outrageous attempts to expose her mother's flaws are all foiled, as Georgia also comes up with hysterical schemes to win her daughter's love. Meanwhile, things get more riotous when Nanny Ninonu's blind heart falls for Junjun, who is obviously gay and definitely shows no interest liking her back.

The civil parish of Old Cleeve covers an area of and includes the villages of Old Cleeve, Blue Anchor, Roadwater and Washford as well as hamlets such as Bilbrook, Chapel Cleeve, Golsoncott and Leighland Chapel. Approximately half the parish lies within the Exmoor National Park. The remaining half is on the southern edge of Exmoor. The village has been in existence since the early 13th century. The village held its first council meeting in 1711. By the 1720s the village had several churches, in which to meet. The town hall was built in 1727. The first church here was built in 1694, built by the Eastern Christian Society. This church was destroyed in a fire in 1847, and has been rebuilt and restored.In 2011, the population of the parish was 1,672. Etymology The name Cleeve, first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Clive, comes from the dative singular form of the Old English word clif ('cliff, bank, steep hill').A. D. Mills, A Dictionary of English Place Names (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), s.v. Cleeve. It became known as Old Cleeve to distinguish the principal village north of the main A39 road from the later site of Cleeve Abbey to the south. The hamlet of Golsoncott takes its name from the Old English words goldsmi√∞ ('goldsmith') and cott ('cottage').Smith, A. H., English Place-Name Elements, 2 vols, English Place-Name Society, 25‚Äì26 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1956), s.v. goldsmi√∞. History The parish of Old Cleeve was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. Black Monkey Bridge, which was built around 1860, carries the West Somerset Railway, a steam operated heritage railway over a stream and footpath. Old Cleeve was also near the route of the West Somerset Mineral Railway which ran from the ironstone mines in the Brendon Hills to the port of Watchet on the Bristol Channel. The old Mineral line railway station which was built in 1861 is now a store, and there is also a bridge remaining from this line. Governance Administratively, it falls within the West Somerset local government district and the Somerset shire county, with administrative tasks shared between county, district and parish councils. The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. An electoral ward of the same name exists. The ward stretches from the Bristol Channel south via Washford to Luxborough. The total ward population at the 2011 Census was 2,196. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography Countryside on the coastal path Between Old Cleeve and Watchet is Cleeve Hill a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which covers a moderate to steeply sloping south face of the Washford River Valley. It supports a rich and diverse calcareous grassland community with associated mixed woodland and scrub. The site contains two species of plant which are nationally rare in Great Britain, Nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum) and Rough Marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta). The parish extends to the coast of Bridgwater Bay between Blue Anchor and Watchet, in an area previously known as Cleeve Bay, on the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It provides an outstanding series of sections through the Early Jurassic Lower Lias, spanning the Hettangian and Pliensbachian Stages and named the \\"Lilstock Formation\\". The Triassic cliffs have geological interest for the variety of fossils and is on the South West Coast Path. There is the remains of a Lime Kiln complex which was used in the 18th century. Bridgwater Bay consists of large areas of mud flats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Religious sites The parish church of St Andrew dates from the 12th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The floor of the porch was cobbled with alabaster stones from the beach below the village and set in the shape of a heart during the 17th century. In Leighland Chapel is the church of St Giles which was built in 1861 by Charles Edmund Giles on the site of a previous building. Cleeve Abbey in Washford village, is a medieval monastery founded in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order. In 1536 Cleeve Abbey was closed by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was converted into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as farm buildings until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve Abbey was taken into state care; it is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber. Binham Farmhouse was built in the 15th century as the grange to the abbey. Chapel Cleeve Manor, which dates from 1452, is the remains of a pilgrim's hospice attached to the chapel, which was enlarged as a country house, has been a hotel and is now a private house.

It has been granted orphan drug status. The drug is to be used orally. Trials A Canadian Phase III clinical trial has been completed. Phase III trials in Europe and the US started in June 2009 and are expected to complete in April 2013. Mechanism of action Ranirestat is aldose reductase inhibitor that acts by reducing sorbitol accumulation in cells. Aldose reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes one of the steps in sorbitol (polyol) pathway which is responsible for formation of fructose from glucose. Aldose reductase activity is increased, parallel to glucose blood levels, in tissues that are not insulin sensitive, including lenses, peripheral nerves and renal glomeruli. Sorbitol does not diffuse through cell membranes easily and therefore accumulates in these tissues, causing osmotic damage, leading to retinopathy and neuropathy. Efficacy Results from a Canadian double-blind, placebo-controlled biopsy Phase III clinical trial, involving total of 549 patients with diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP) randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or 10, 20, or 40 mg/day ranirestat for 52 weeks, showed that ranirestat appears to have effect on motor nerve function in mild to moderate DSP, but failed to show statistically significant difference in sensory nerve function. Efficacy of ranirestat was evaluated by nerve conduction studies, the modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (mTCNS), and quantitative sensory tests (QSTs).

S. state of Michigan and judge from the Arizona Territory. Early life Backus was born in Norwich, Connecticut to James and Dorothy Church (Chandler) Backus on April 4, 1809. He was educated in local schools. Following graduation he worked briefly as a store clerk before he began reading law under Calvin Goddard and attending lectures at Yale University. Backus was admitted to the bar in 1833 and practiced for a short time in Norwich before moving to Michigan. In Michigan, Backus initially lived in Detroit at the house of his cousin, William Woodbridge. He also formed a law partnership with Woodbridge. He later became senior partner in the law firm, Backus and Harbough. Backus married Woodbridge's daughter, Juliana Trumball, on December 7, 1835. The couple had five children, two of which lived to maturity. Politics Backus served as a Whig in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1840 and was a member of the state constitutional convention of 1850. He was Grand Master of Masons in Michigan from 1851 to 1853 and served as alderman from the 9th ward of Detroit from 1860 to 1861. In 1860, Backus was elected as a Republican to the Michigan Senate and chosen as president pro tempore of the state senate after Joseph R. Williams took on the duties as the Lieutenant Governor of Michigan. After the death of Williams a couple months later on June 15, 1861, Backus took on the duties as the 15th Lieutenant Governor under Austin Blair until January 1863. Judicial career Following the resignation of William Thompson Howell from the Arizona bench, U.S. Senator Jacob M. Howard recommended Backus as a replacement. The new Associate Justice received his commission on March 11, 1865. He reached Prescott for the opening of the territorial supreme court's first session on December 26, 1865 and left for his posting in Tucson on January 2, 1866. While he served faithfully during his four years of office, during his spare time he explored the region including trips to the Colorado river and an 1867 journey into Mexico. As his term neared an end, Backus issued a ruling in a pair of cases that had significant impact upon the territory. The ruling determined that the means of apportionment used by the territory violated the Arizona Organic Act. As a result, the legality of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Arizona Territorial Legislatures was brought into question. This had the consequence of effectively crippling the territorial government. The issue was not resolved until March 23, 1870 when the United States Congress passed a law confirming the legality of the territorial legislature's actions despite any irregularities that may have occurred. Retirement and death Backus declined to seek reappointment when his term expired in March 1869. He instead returned to his private legal practice in Detroit. In Michigan, he discovered that his health, which included a chronic throat condition, had been helped by the Arizona climate. In 1875, Backus requested appointment to a position in either Arizona or New Mexico territories but no such posting was available. He returned to Arizona Territory in March 1877 and stayed at the home of his friend, Charles T. Hayden of Tempe. In addition to making his home in the territory, the former justice planned to use his \\"ample fortune\\" to found the territory's first bank in Prescott. While traveling through Mohave County with Hayden, Backus became ill near the town of Greenwood. Backus died in Greenwood on July 13, 1877. He was initially buried in Greenwood with his remains later moved to Yantic Cemetery in Norwich, Connecticut.

It reduces the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol which is believed to be the cause of diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy It is well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse effects being gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, as well as increases in certain liver enzymes. Chemically, epalrestat is unusual in that it is a drug that contains a rhodanine group. Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the polyol pathway whose enhanced activity is the basis of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) target this enzyme. Out of the many ARIs developed, ranirestat and fidarestat are in the trial stage. Others have been discarded due to unacceptable adverse effects or weak efficacy. Epalrestat is the only ARI commercially available. It is easily absorbed into the neural tissue and inhibits the enzyme with minimum side effects.  Evidence  It has been proven in animal experiments that there is an improvement in sorbitol levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity leading to improved nerve conduction velocity. Diabetic rats treated with epalrestat showed improvement in morphological abnormalities of nerves. In a placebo controlled double blind trial of 196 patients, it was proved that Epalrestat in a dose of 150 mg/day improved the effects of diabetic neuropathy like upper limb spontaneous pain, motor nerve conduction velocity, thresholds of vibratory sensation and autonomic nerve function as compared to a placebo. These effects were significantly better in those with poorer control of diabetes. A systematic review and metaanalysis showed that based on the results of 10 articles, it can be concluded that Epalrestat has some benefit in the control of diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy but only in the early or mild cases. It also doesn't influence glycaemic control.

It was popularized by Ferlin Husky and Jean Shepard, and was a crossover country-pop hit in 1953. The song played on the concept of a Dear John letter while referencing the United States' involvement in the Korean War. Here, a young woman, whose boyfriend John was stationed in Korea, writes stating that she is breaking off the relationship. To add to the heartbreak: She is marrying John's brother, Don, and wants her photograph back (because ‚Äî according to the lyrics ‚Äî Don wants it now). Chart success \\"A Dear John Letter\\" was performed as a duet by the two performers, with Husky speaking his part while Shepard sang hers. \\"Dear John\\" was released in 1953 and was a big success. The song topped the Billboard magazine country charts and reached No. 4 on the Billboard pop charts; in addition, it turned the unknown singers into star performers in the United States. When \\"A Dear John Letter\\" topped the Billboard country charts, Shepard ‚Äî at 19 years, nine months ‚Äî became the youngest female artist to that point to have a no. 1 country single. She kept that record for nearly 20 years, when 14-year-old Tanya Tucker topped the Hot Country Singles chart with \\"What's Your Mama's Name.\\" Cover versions and sequels \\"Dear John\\" has been covered by several other performers, including Pat Boone. Following Husky and Shepard, Skeeter Davis and Bobby Bare recorded the song together in 1965, resulting in a No. 11 country hit for themselves that year. Red Sovine and Ernest Tubb also recorded cover versions of \\"A Dear John Letter.\\" The song was released as \\"K√§re John\\" in Sweden/Scandinavia by Swedish jazz vocalist Alice Babs and Charlie Norman och deras Reeperbahn Stompers in the 1950s. Lennart and Ingrid Reuterski√∂ld wrote the Swedish lyrics. Shepard and Husky recorded a reply to \\"Dear John,\\" called \\"Forgive Me, John,\\" which was another popular country music song. The song was released by MGM Records (catalogue M-G-M 5161 in Australia) by The Four Horsemen with vocals by Pat O'Day, in 1954. Between 1972 and 1974, this song was covered by Singapore-based female singer Ervinna, backing music by The Charlie & His Boys, on her LP album Golden Hits Of 20th Century Vol. 4 with the local White Cloud Record. In popular culture In 1954, Stan Freberg, also of Capitol Records, released a parody version of \\"A Dear John Letter\\", which he called \\"A Dear John and Marsha Letter\\". In this parody, John tries to say his \\"I was overseas in battle\\" dialogue, but Marsha's humorous interruptions force him to change his accent a little bit. When John finishes his dialogue, Marsha steps in, much to his annoyance and forcing him to scream at her. Marsha starts lamenting about the nice things John had said to her, jumping in the flashback of \\"John and Marsha\\". John tries to cheer her up by offering her a can of worms and a pomegranate, but Marsha doesn't want any of these and requests to sing in the background, which she did. Thus, John is able to finish his spoken words, using the same accent Marsha wanted him to do earlier.

Listed at 5'8\\", 150 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. He was born in San Francisco, California. Lodigiani enjoyed a 17-year baseball career (1935‚Äì1954), playing parts of six seasons in the majors (1938‚Äì42, 1946) and 14 in the minor leagues (1935‚Äì40; 1947‚Äì54), losing three years while serving in military (1943‚Äì45). Early life He played second base for Lowell High School (San Francisco), as his double play partner was shortstop Joe DiMaggio. In 1935, he graduated from Galileo High School (SF), where he was an All-Star in the baseball, basketball and football teams. Professional career At age 19, Lodigiani started his professional career with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League (1935‚Äì37) and later joined the Williamsport Grays of the Eastern League (1938). He entered the majors in 1938 with the Philadelphia Athletics, playing for them until 1940 in one game before joining the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League (1940). He returned to major league action with the Chicago White Sox (1941‚Äì42), and later served in the US Army Air Force during World War II (1943‚Äì45). After discharge, he rejoined the ChiSox in 1946, his last major league season. In his rookie season with Philadelphia, Lodigiani posted a .280 batting average with six home runs and 44 RBI in 93 games. The next year he recorded career-highs in games (121), hits (102), runs (46), doubles (22), and matched his numbers in home runs and RBI while hitting .260. In a six-season career, Lodigiani was a .260 hitter (355‚Äìfor‚Äì1364) with 16 home runs and 156 RBI in 405 games, including 142 runs, 71 doubles, seven triples, 12 stolen bases, and a .338 on- base percentage.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 316. It is situated just over east from the A1 road, south-east from Grantham and north from Stamford. It has approximately 138 houses. History A Deserted Medieval Village has been identified nearby, probably the vill of Sudwelle. Traces of earlier settlements in the form of barrow burials have also been suggested. The village is reputed to have been a site for signalling beacons at the time of the Spanish Armada and a modern fire-basket stands in the village, erected for 400th anniversary in 1988. In 1848 the village was described as: \\"Swayfield (St. Nicholas), a parish, in the union of Bourne, wapentake of Beltisloe, parts of Kesteven, county of Lincoln, 2 miles (S. by W.) from Corby; containing 265 inhabitants. The living is a rectory, valued in the king's books at ¬£11. 2. 11., and in the gift of the Crown; net income, ¬£391. The tithes were commuted for land and corn-rents in 1797\\". During the Second World War, Swayfield was the site of two dummy airfields, the remains of which can still be seen. Geography Swayfield is from Bourne (via the A151), from Grantham (via the B1176), from Stamford (via the B1176) and from Oakham. It is 3 miles from the county boundary with Rutland, at the point near Stocken (HM Prison). The road to the west towards Lobthorpe is Overgate Road. To the east, adjacent to the village, is the East Coast Main Line. Nearby villages include Castle Bytham, Corby Glen, Swinstead, Creeton and Lobthorpe. Landmarks St Nicholas Church is on the edge of the village on Church Lane and is part of the Corby Glen group of churches in the Beltisloe Deanery; the incumbent is the Revd Margaret Barton. Although the village has no priest, it has a lay reader. Swayfield has a public house, the Royal Oak on High Street, and a village hall.

Black was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, England, and was brought up in Buckinghamshire, England. He was the only son of tea-taster Dudley Black and Joan n√©e Denton. At age two he was isolated for a whole year in hospital with polio, then at age five he suffered the death of his mother. After his attendance at Slough Grammar School for Boys, in 1969 Black went to Oxford University as Exhibitioner in Classics to Worcester College. At Oxford he became interested in the ancient languages and cultures of Mesopotamia, and after qualifying changed his studies to Sumerian and Akkadian under Professor Oliver Gurney. Black's (still unpublished) BA dissertation was entitled \\"A History of Nippur, from the Earliest Times to the End of the Kassite Period‚Äù: this work was utilised in the very beginning of S.W. Cole's book Nippur in Late Assyrian Times, ca. 745-612 B.C., 1996, where it is described as the \\"only systematic treatment of Nippur's early history\\". In 1975 Black attained his BPhil in Cuneiform Studies. For postgraduate studies, partly supervised by Edmond Sollberger of the British Museum, and with the continuing guidance of Gurney at Oxford, Black wrote his DPhil dissertation on \\"Ancient Babylonian Grammatical Theory\\", submitted in 1980 and later published under the title Sumerian Grammar in Babylonian Theory, Rome 1984, 2nd edition 1991. A.R. George has described it as \\"the only book-length examination of the linguistic thinking that underpinned the Babylonians' understanding of Sumerian\\". While completing his DPhil dissertation, Black took a position with St Catherine¬¥s Foundation at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park. In 1981, however, he was enabled to return full-time to the field of Assyriology by his appointment to a Research Associate post at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago to work on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary Project (see acknowledgement of his contribution on the title pages of volumes 17/≈† [1989‚Äì1992] and 14/R [1999]). In 1982 Black took up the post of Assistant Director of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, the Baghdad wing of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq, succeeding Michael Roaf, who had been elevated to the directorship. Following the resignation of Roaf in late 1985, Black was appointed Director, which post he held until early 1988. In Iraq Black served as epigrapher on a number of archaeological expeditions, and in Baghdad carried out research in the Iraq Museum, where he worked especially on the tablets (cuneiform documents) discovered in the earlier major British excavations at Ur and Nimrud; the latter were published in J.A. Black and D. J. Wiseman, Cuneiform Tablets from Nimrud, 4: Literary Texts from the Temple of Nab√ª, London 1996. Black also collaborated on Assyriological works with Iraqi scholars, notably with Farouk Al-Rawi, and with other colleagues from the days in Baghdad: the book Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary (co-authored with Anthony Green, illustrated by Tessa Rickards, London and Austin 1992, 2nd edition 1998) grew out of such an association. Also in Iraq, Black met and married the British archaeologist Ellen McAdam (later divorced). Benefitting from the recommendations of the 1986 Parker Report into Asian and African Studies in Universities in the UK, in 1988 Oxford University was able to re- establish a full-time lectureship in Assyriology (absent since the retirement of Gurney in 1978). The new post, known as University Lecturer in Akkadian, was awarded to Black, who was also elected a Fellow of Wolfson College. Back in Oxford ‚Äì apart from periods devoted to full administrative duties, first as Senior Proctor of the University, 1995‚Äì1996, then as chairman of the board of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 1999‚Äì2001 ‚Äì Black was free to develop his studies in Sumerian literature, literary criticism and philology. Most notable was the publication of his Reading Sumerian Poetry, Oxford 1988. In the assessment of A.R. George, this book \\"displays ... a real sensitivity to Sumerian imagery‚Äù. Black also collaborated with Andrew R. George and J. Nicholas Postgate on A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian, 1999 (reprinted 2000). He actively participated in other scholarly projects, such as those of the international ‚ÄúSumerian Grammar Group‚Äù and the Gr√∂ningen-based ‚ÄúMesopotamian Literature Group‚Äù. From 1997, with initial funding from the Leverhulme Trust, and later from the Arts and Humanities Research Board, Black founded and administered what may well come to be considered his greatest legacy, the Internet-based \\"Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature\\". Work by the project team continued after Black's death, although active funding was ended in mid-2006. The Jeremy Allen Black Trust for Assyriology, a fund to support young Assyriologists, was established by the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Oxford University in his memory. Towards the end of his life Black had the pleasurable discovery of, and contact with, his half-brother, Peter Mitchell (the son of Dudley by his first wife), living in the British Virgin Islands. He was also an enthusiastic amateur musician who sang bass with the Cathedral Singers of Christ Church, Oxford, and with the Northamptonshire-based period music ensemble Fiori Musicali.

Tallington has a busy level crossing over the East Coast Main Line. There was once a Tallington railway station, but it is now closed. Since the 1930s there has been a plan for a Tallington bypass and bridge over the railway ; even though the village ended up making concrete bridges for many UK motorways (including much of the Yorkshire section of the M62), there has never been a bridge made for the village. Dow Mac even offered to donate a bridge to the village. From the East Coast Main Line south-east of the village, the parish boundary follows the River Welland to the west, it meets Uffington and crosses the A16 a half-mile west of the village at the point where the pylons cross the road, then skirts the edge of Casewick Park. It crosses the ECML a half-mile north of the village, and meets Barholm and Stowe. It skirts the northern edge of Barholm Lodge, across the north section of Tallington Lakes and meets West Deeping at King Street. It follows King Street southwards to the A16, which it follows to the west, around the western edge of West Deeping, to the River Welland, north of Lolham Mill, where it meets the City of Peterborough and the parish of Bainton.

Hale, \\"Francisco Bulnes\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 485. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Biography He educated as an engineer, but is better known as an influential liberal intellectual during the regime of Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. He served D√≠az as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. As a trained scientist, \\"it is not surprising that Francisco Bulnes became one of the leading figures in Mexico's liberal- positivist school, collectively known as the Cient√≠ficos.Karen Racine, \\"Francisco Bulnes\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, p. 168. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997. Positivism was the prevailing intellectual movement of the period and took a scientific approach to economic development and to history. Bulnes was born in Mexico City in 1847 and attended the National Mining School. He then taught mathematics at the prestigious National Preparatory School, later also teaching other sciences as well as political economy. As a member of Mexico's Society of Geography and Statistics, Bulnes traveled to Japan with a delegation of Mexican scientists. He entered political life through his work on the Mexico City-Veracruz railway line when he met liberal Veracruz politician Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. Bulnes became a long-serving Mexican senator, where he drafted the first Bank Law and the Mining Code of 1880.Racine, \\"Francisco Bulnes\\" p. 168. He was an admirer of the British political system and admired the progress of both the United Kingdom and the United States. He was a full supporter of liberal ideology which in Mexico sought to curtail the political and economic power of the Roman Catholic Church. Its religious doctrines stressed rewards in the afterlife and in liberals' view was an impediment to personal advancement and national economic development. He viewed Protestantism as \\"more suited to modern cultures.\\"Racine, \\"Francisco Bulnes\\" p. 168. In El porvenir de las nations Hispano-Americanas (The Future of the Hispanic-American Nations), published in 1899 in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Bulnes attributed Mexico's backwardness to a combination of Iberian conservatism and Indian debility. He explained the natives' weakness, using the recently developed science of nutrition, by dividing mankind into three races: the people of corn, wheat, and rice. After some dubious calculations of the nutritional value of staple grains, he concluded that ‚Äúthe race of wheat is the only truly progressive one,‚Äù and that ‚Äúmaize has been the eternal pacifier of America's indigenous races and the foundation of their refusal to become civilized.‚Äù Bulnes attacked the reputation of the late president Benito Ju√°rez, describing him \\"as an insignificant provincial lawyer with no clear ideology until he met Ocampo in New Orleans.\\"Brian Hamnett, Ju√°rez. New York: Longmans 1994, 244-245. Bulnes's attack on Ju√°rez was contested by among others Genero Garc√≠a and Justo Sierra.Hamnett, Ju√°rez, p. 245. In 1910 when the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1920) erupted and the D√≠az regime collapsed, Bulnes left Mexico for exile in New Orleans and then Havana, returning to Mexico in 1921 following the end of the military phase of the Revolution. Bulnes published a defense of D√≠az in 1920 and a critique of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's role in the Revolution.Racine, \\"Francisco Bulnes\\", p. 169. As a staunch defender of the D√≠az regime and one who espoused politically charged opinions on a variety of topics, Bulnes's reputation in Mexico has suffered. Manuel Gamio, the archaeologist who excavated the pyramids of Teotihuac√°n, denounced Bulnes as a racist, while Daniel Cosio Villegas, a leading historian, described him as ‚Äúone of the most evasive, designing, and deceitful writers that Mexico has ever produced.‚Äù However, historian of Mexican liberalism, Charles A.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Increase A. Lapham was a Liberty ship laid down under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1584, on 10 June 1943, at Richmond, California, by the Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 2; launched on 29 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Chester P. Kenman; acquired by the Navy on 5 October 1943; converted for naval service by the Hurley Marine Works, Oakland, California; renamed Alkes (AK-110) on 6 October 1943; and placed in commission at Oakland on 29 October 1943, Commander William H. Wight in command. Service history After shakedown training, the new cargo ship got underway for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, her base of operations while she carried supplies to the forward areas in the Pacific Ocean. In early December, the ship sailed to the Gilbert Islands with Task Unit (TU) 16.15.1. She reached Makin Island on 16 December, and commenced unloading. The ship moved to Baker Island on 31 December, to take on cargo prior to returning to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 13 January 1944. = Supplying forces in the Marshall Islands = Shortly after returning to Hawaii, the vessel began taking on supplies and equipment for another shuttle run. Alkes sailed on 25 January for the Marshall Islands. Upon reaching Majuro Atoll, on 3 February, the ship began unloading her cargo to support ongoing landing operations. One week later, she reversed her course and arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 21 February. = Supplying the South Pacific forces = Alkes got underway again on 12 March, bound for the Marshall and Gilbert Islands with Task Group 16.12. Among her ports of call were Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Majuro, Marshall Islands; and Tarawa and Makin, Gilbert Islands. Alkes returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 May, to replenish her cargo. She shaped a course back to the Marshalls on 22 May and made stops at Kwajalein and Eniwetok. The vessel arrived at Guam on 8 August, where she remained for one month discharging cargo and delivering fresh water to various ships of the fleet. = Repairs stateside = Alkes arrived back at Pearl Harbor on 11 September. After 10 days in port, she continued sailing east toward the United States. The vessel reached San Pedro, California, on 3 October and, shortly thereafter, began alterations and repairs. She moved to San Francisco, California, on 27 October, to take on cargo and, on 6 November, sailed for Pearl Harbor. = Return trips to the South Pacific = The ship reached Hawaiian waters on 16 November, and sailed the next day for Eniwetok, Guam, and Ulithi. Alkes reached Ulithi on 13 December, and assumed duty there as a fleet issue ship. She operated at Ulithi until 6 February 1945, when she got underway for a return voyage to California. Alkes arrived at San Pedro on 4 March and underwent repairs while taking on supplies and equipment. She sailed on the 23d to resume her cargo operations in the Western Pacific. On 12 April, the ship returned to Ulithi, where she remained until late May, preparing for the impending assault on the Ry≈´ky≈´s. = Supporting Okinawa invasion operations = Alkes got underway with TU 13.11.2 on 23 May, bound for Okinawa. She remained off that island and Kerama Retto from 28 May through 13 August issuing her cargo to units of the invasion force. She experienced numerous air attacks but continued to carry out her duties without sustaining any serious damage. = Return to stateside duties = She left Okinawa in mid-August and sailed via Ulithi to the west coast of the United States. The ship again reached San Pedro on 14 September and remained there until early January 1946, serving as a fleet issue ship. On 3 January, she set a course for the US East Coast. Having transited the Panama Canal, Alkes arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 31 January.  Inactivation and decommissioning  Preparations for her inactivation were then begun. The vessel sailed to Baltimore, Maryland, on 8 February and was placed out of commission there on 20 February 1946. She was returned to the Maritime Administration on 27 February, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 12 March 1946. The ship was subsequently laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia, as SS Increase A. Lapham. She was sold on 26 October 1971, to Hierros Ardes S.

History The settlement of Blue Mounds was founded in 1828 by Ebenezer Brigham on the south slope of the eastern mound of the Blue Mounds. In 1832, when word arrived that Chief Black Hawk and his 1200 Sauk followers had crossed the Mississippi River, it was decided to build a fort to protect the settlers. On May 10, 1832, the construction of Fort Blue Mounds began with the help of the residents of Blue Mounds, led by the newly promoted Colonel Ebenezer Brigham. The fort was built a mile south of Eastern Mound on the highest part of the open prairie, allowing for a commanding view of the open country for miles. Those who defended the fort were able to see to the east, south, and west, with the mound bounding the northern side of the fort. Word quickly arrived at the settlement of an engagement between Black Hawk's group and the Illinois militia on May 14, 1832. In what was to be called the Battle of Stillman's Run, the Illinois militia were defeated by the Indians. This, along with the closeness of the Ho-Chunk tribe, brought fear to the settlers, and they worked quickly to complete the fort in about two weeks. From May 20 to September 20, 1832, the settlers and miners joined General Henry Dodge's Michigan Territory Militia during the Black Hawk War. James Aubrey was the first commander at the fort, but after he was killed by the Indians on June 6, his first lieutenant, Edward Beouchard, took command. He didn't command long before Captain John Sherman succeeded him. Archaeology The site of the original fort was owned by Colonel Brigham's descendants until it was donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society, who dedicated it as a state historical site on September 5, 1921. Through excavation, it was found that the layout of the fort was very similar to one at Apple River in Illinois. The fort was surrounded by a picket fence about in length on each side. Its wall was made from oak trees that were about 16 or in height, with of trunk planted in the ground. At two of the corners of the fort were square blockhouses. Inside the wall was a log building in the center that was 30 by that was used as a store-house and barracks. Today On May 22, 2010, the Blue Mounds Fort marker was rededicated following a three-year fundraising effort by the Blue Mounds Area Historical Society. The marker, which was cleaned up and re-mounted on a chert boulder donated by Blue Mound State Park, sits on the site of the Fort, although it is not currently accessible by the public.

Available from http://www.britarch.ac.uk/conserve/planning/plansheet8.html The historic landscape characterisation programme does not restrict itself to historic buildings, ornamental landscapes and purely \\"archaeological\\" features, but embraces other man made features such as hedges and managed woodland. It recognises that the landscape itself can be historic (in addition to historic features within it). Recognising the historic character of a landscape is intended to allow the landscape itself to be managed and protected within the planning regime operating in England. In most cases, characterisation is focused on an English county, although in some cases it is applied to a region crossing county boundaries. The programme is intended to: * document the existing situation in a standardised way; * identify gaps that merit investigation; * enable participation in the process by local residents; * provide information for bodies responsible for planning and land use. The results are incorporated within a geographical information system which allows maps to be prepared at the level of detail appropriate to the particular purpose. Types of landscape are characterised based on the way in which they were formed, their current and earlier land uses and their physical appearance. Other than the landscape itself, the methodology is largely desk based;Factsheet 8: Historic Characterisation, Planning and Regeneration, Council for British Archaeology. sources include aerial photographs as well as current and historic maps. Since the landscape is not static, the characterisation will be updated periodically. Despite being a largely desk- based subject, some academics are keen to point out that this is not the most important way to understand the historic landscape. They emphasize the \\"social and experiential\\" nature of the landscape, and that historically, this is how the landscape would have been understood: in person. It is also important to bear in mind that the landscape, as W. G. Hoskins stated in the 1950s, at the birth of landscape history as a discipline, that the landscape is a palimpsest.W.G. Hoskins, \\"The Making of the English Landscape\\" HLC projects only display one layer at a time, and can be misleading without closer examination combined with some knowledge of landscape history. Historic landscape characterisation has no statutory basis, however local planning authorities are required to \\"take account of the historical dimensions of the landscape as a whole\\".Planning Policy Guidance 15: Planning and the historic environment, September 1994, published by The Stationery Office. Available from A good example of the advice of an HLC being ignored is that of the \\"West of Stevenage\\" building proposal; in which the HLC and other sources recommended that the proposal be turned down, it was granted by the then deputy prime minister, John Prescott. However, the Isle of Axholme (Lincolnshire) was granted extra protection from development by the historic landscape characterisation project, so it can clearly be seen that some instances, or some authorities, use these projects and their advice more carefully than others.

As a solo composer, Phatak has also created the background scores for films such as Fire in the Blood (2013) and Zubaan (2016). Fire in the Blood premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013. Zubaan, which premiered at the Busan Film Festival in 2015, was released mid-2016. He recently completed music for Ashram, a film that is slated for a 2018 release. Musician Phatak has been a part of over 15 contemporary music albums. He and Ghanekar released the Smoke Signals (2008), an album that has been in the making for 8 years, and one that features the duo's hit songs from their films. 2008 also saw the release of Phatak's debut solo album Sigh of an Angel where he collaborated with Australian artist Aurora Jane, acclaimed jazz guitarist Sanjay Divecha, Ghanekar, drummer Lindsay D'mello and singers Vivienne Pocha and Carolisa Monteiro. Phatak handled keyboards, vocals and guitar responsibilities. This was followed by The Psychic Plumber and Other Lies (2011), a multimedia project between Phatak and popular contemporary artist Sarnath Banerjee. Inspired by the products and advertising of the 70s and 80s, this collaboration culminated in a combination of text and drawings, sound and music, to recreate life in pre-liberalisation India. The Petri Dish Project, an ambient psychedelic rock album with an acoustic as well as an electronic vibe, saw Phatak regroup with Lindsay D&#39;Mello, and collaborate with a host of other musicians such as Monica Dogra, Suman Sridhar, Anushka Manchanda, Saba Azad, and JD Thirumalai. Entrepreneur: _blueFROG_ In 2008, Phatak and Dhruv, along with fellow partners Simran Mulchandani, Srila Chatterjee and Mahesh Mathai launched blueFROG, a live music venue in Lower Parel, Mumbai. The brand also expanded to open branches in Pune and Bangalore. The Delhi outlet shut for a few months in 2012 before reopening in a new avatar. blueFROG Mumbai shut down in August 2016. _The True School of Music_ In 2013, Phatak, along with noted sound engineer Nitin Chandy and other partners from related fields, united to form The True School of Music.

He was knighted in 1957 and was created a Labour Party life peer on 14 January 1966, taking the title Baron Campbell of Eskan, of Camis Eskan in the County of Dumbarton.Alastair Campbell A History of Clan Campbell (Vol. 3, p. 282), Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004. A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain He was Chairman of the Commonwealth Sugar Exporters Association (1950‚Äì84). He was additionally notable as chairman of Booker McConnell, Chairman of the New Statesman and Nation and the first chairman of the Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Childhood and youth Jock's paternal grandfather, William Middleton Campbell, was Governor of the Bank of England between 1907 and 1909, a man of great prestige. His mother Mary was of aristocratic Irish stock. Jock was born on 8 August 1912 and at the age of three was sent to the opulent family seat of his mother's family, Glenstal Castle in southern Ireland, to be safe from the bombs of the German Zeppelins. After the war Jock returned to the family home in Kent. He later attended Eton and Oxford. Family background: the slave trade It was John Campbell (Senior), Jock's great-great-grandfather, ship owner and merchant of Glasgow, who, towards the end of the 18th century, first established the fortunes of the Campbell family in the West Indies, through the slave trade. At the time, Glasgow trading houses, long-experienced in servicing the needs of North American slave plantations, were ready to capitalise on new opportunities in the sugar industry arising on the West Indies. By the 1780s they were supplying the two most important British exports to the West Indies, herring and coarse linen goods. Among the principal beneficiaries of this booming trade were John Campbell (Senior) and Company, which supplied merchandise to the slave plantations along the coast of Guiana, then in Dutch hands. It was in this role of supplier that the company first began to acquire plantations along the Essequibo Coast of Guiana, from planters facing bankruptcy. Jock Campbell later remarked often that, in acquiring estates through foreclosure, his ancestors became de facto slave-owners. Campbell himself abhorred slavery, and it was in fact the urge to make good the misdeeds of his own family that was the catalyst for his own reformist ideals. On 5 May 1971, in the House of Lords, Campbell dissociated himself from his ancestors, arguing that \\"maximising profits cannot and should not be the sole purpose, or even the primary purpose, of business.\\" By the 20th century, the company of Curtis, Campbell and Co had its established place in the British Guiana plantocracy; it owned Ogle Plantation in Demerara and Albion Estate, up the Atlantic coast in the Corentyne district, and a wharf in Georgetown. When Jock's great- grandfather, Colin Campbell of Colgrain, died in 1886 he left ¬£1 million, a fortune at the time (about ¬£ million today). When his grandfather (William Middleton Campbell) died in 1919, he left ¬£1.5 million (about ¬£ million today), all of it from the cane fields of British Guiana. Arriving in British Guiana Jock went to British Guiana for the first time to take charge of the family estates, arriving in 1934. The Campbells owned Las Penitence Wharf on the Demerara River, Georgetown, where they were agents for the Harrison line of shipping. They also owned Ogle Estate, up the East Coast from Demerara, and Albion, further Eastward in the Berbice district. In his first few months in the colony Jock worked at the family's wharf, assessing the claims made by merchants whose goods had been broached, broken or stolen. After several months on the wharf he went to continue his apprenticeship at Albion Estate in the Essequibo District. One anecdote of this time is characteristic of the shock he suffered on seeing the appalling conditions of the workers: When shown around the family plantation at Albion, in the Corentyne district of British Guiana, Jock was appalled by the living conditions of the coolies, the East Indian cane cutters. The East Indians had been brought into the country after the liberation of the slaves, and were housed in the same tiny, dark, vermin-infested, earth-floored ‚Äúlogies‚Äù. Next to the logies was a more pretentious building, clean, painted, smart-looking, a mansion in comparison to the shacks. ‚ÄúJock enquired who lived in the hovels: 'Our coolies,' replied Bee (the estate manager). He then asked of the residents of the trimmed building. Bee said, 'Oh! We keep our mules there.' A na√Øve 22-year-old Jock asked flippantly: 'Why don‚Äôt you move your coolies to the mules‚Äô palace and put your mules in the hovels?' A stunned Bee exclaimed cryptically: 'Mules cost money, sir!'\\" Reform of the sugar estates As the son of the estate owner, Jock had enormous influence in spite of his youth and soon embarked on a mission of reform, and this became his life work. As the first step of plan, Jock urged his father and uncle to merge the family company the giant company Booker Brothers, McConnell and Co. The take-over took place in 1934, after which Jock quickly rose to chairman. Bookers, as it was then known, at the time was a state within a state, owning almost all the colony‚Äôs sugar plantations and dominating the economic life of the country so much it was called ‚ÄúBooker‚Äôs Guiana‚Äù. As head of this state, Jock went about implementing his reforms. Jock was partly driven by the guilt of his family background, but also by the conviction that every business has a responsibility towards its workers; and that profit alone should not be the guiding principle of society. His reforms continued on a grander scale. According to Ian McDonald, one of his employees: ‚ÄúAll Jock‚Äôs abundant energy was converted to a faith that Booker had to mean something in a new deal for the West Indies‚Ä¶ Demerara was his Damascus.‚Äù > I believe that there should be values other than money in a civilised > society. I believe that truth, beauty and goodness have a place. Moreover, I > believe that if businessmen put money, profit, greed and acquisition among > the highest virtues, they cannot be surprised if, for instance, nurses, > teachers and ambulance men are inclined to do the same. In effect, Jock Campbell became a socialist-capitalist. He initiated a process in which Bookers was completely reorganised and recreated. The sugar industry was transformed from a run-down, unprofitable, inhuman, paternalistic and plantocratic expatriate family concern into a rehabilitated, forward-looking, productive and dynamic enterprise. Guianese were placed in the highest positions; if they did not have the skills for these positions, they were sent away for training. Sugar production grew from 170,000 tons to 350,000 tons. Estates were consolidated and factories modernised. Drainage and irrigation facilities and the whole infrastructure of field works were completely revamped. Agricultural practices and applications were overhauled in line with current world-class technology. The first sugar bulk-loading terminal in the Caribbean was established to replace the drudgery of loading sugar in bags. The people side of the industry was revolutionised: remuneration vastly increased, the old logies eliminated and 15,000 new houses in 75 housing areas built with roads and water supplied. Medical services were upgraded to cater for all sugar workers and their families and the scourge of malaria was eradicated, Community Centres were established on all estates and welfare, sporting and library activities expanded. Training and education were immensely improved; scholarship programs initiated, and all along Guianisation moved forward until the time came when the industry was being run almost entirely by Guianese. It was an era of tremendous growth and change. As a member of the Fabian Society, Jock Campbell's key message was quite simple: > People are more important than ships, shops and sugar estates. Employees were greatly inspired by him. Said one: > We tried to act in the belief that business could not possibly just be about > making money if only because that would be soul-destroyingly boring. > Business had to be about making the lives of people better and more > fulfilled. People in any case always came first however you considered what > you were trying to do in business. You had a fourfold responsibility to > people: to shareholders, to employees, to customers, to the community of > people in which business operated and found its meaning. Creating profit was > vital but not just for its own sake but for good, everyday, ordinarily > human, immediately flesh and blood, life-enhancing purposes. Politics =British Guiana/Guyana= In British Guiana, Campbell met his foil in Cheddi Jagan. Jagan, himself the son of Indian indentured servants, quickly gained the confidence of the sugar workers, and in Guyana's first general elections in 1953 became Prime Minister. Campbell was willing to work with Jagan, as both had the same aims, but Jagan made it clear that the sugar industry would be nationalised after independence. Jagan was removed from power by the British due to his Marxist leanings;The Suspension of the British Guiana Constitution ‚Äì 1953 (Declassified British documents) in his place came Forbes Burnham. =United Kingdom= On 14 January 1966, Campbell was created a life peer, by Harold Wilson, taking the title \\"Baron Campbell of Eskan\\", \\"of Camis Eskan in the County of Dumbarton\\". He was active in the House of Lords on behalf of the Labour Party. The Booker Prize It is after leaving Guyana that Jock, who had always loved great literature, became instrumental in the initiation of a British literature prize. Jock was an old friend and golfing partner of Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond spy novels, who had recently been diagnosed as terminally ill with less than a year to live. During a game of golf Fleming turned to Jock for advice on securing his estate for his family from heavy taxation. Jock initially advised Fleming to turn to accountants and merchant bankers, but then had a new idea: Bookers could act as bankers for Fleming, beneficially for both parties. As a result, Bookers acquired a 51% share in the profits of Glidmore Productions, the company handling the profits from worldwide royalties on Fleming's books, and the associated merchandising rights ‚Äì but not the film rights. Thus was born the Bookers Author Division, with the injunction: > It should make money, not to mention being entertaining, and there could be > advertising interest in it for some of our companies. Bookers later acquired the copyrights of other well-known authors, including novelists Agatha Christie, Dennis Wheatley, Georgette Heyer and the playwrights Robert Bolt and Harold Pinter. It was the copyrights of Agatha Christie which, over time, contributed most to the profit of the Authors Division. The Booker Prize was launched in 1969, after the publishers Jonathan Cape suggested that Bookers might sponsor a major fiction prize. A new sponsor for the prize was announced in April 2002, the Man Group, after which it became known as the Man Booker Prize. Milton Keynes Development Corporation Jock was chairman for the Milton Keynes Development Corporation from 1967. The large, central park initially called City Park, was renamed Campbell Park in his honour. There is a memorial stone by the fountain in his honour which reads simply \\"Si monumentum requiris, circumspice\\". (\\"If you seek a monument, look about you\\", referring to the urban landscape created by his team.Cycling in Milton Keynes In June 1973 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University. He stepped down from the post of chairman of Milton Keynes Development Corporation in 1983 and was replaced by Sir Henry Chilver, who remained in post until Milton Keynes Development Corporation was wound up on 1 April 1992.

It is a concept album with lyrics based upon Cold War themes, using a futuristic version of the tale of Atlantis as a metaphor for a technologically advanced society brought to the brink of destruction. The cover artwork is by Patrick Woodroffe.http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/13Prog_Cover_Artist_Patrick_Woodroffe_Dead_At_74.shtml Much of the album's material first appeared in the Atlantis Suite, an epic science fiction rock opera which was a cornerstone of live Pallas shows at the time. The band's original intent was that the album would present the entire piece as a concept album, with the following running order: Side 1 # \\"Rise and Fall (Part One)\\" - 6:05 # \\"Eastwest\\" - 4:58 # \\"March on Atlantis\\" - 5:23 # \\"Rise and Fall (Part Two)\\" - 4:08 Side 2 # \\"Heart Attack\\" - 7:59 # \\"Atlantis\\" - 7:59 # \\"Ark of Infinity\\" - 7:05 The group did in fact record the entire suite at the time; however, EMI wanted the group to balance its progressive efforts with more commercial songs, such as \\"Eyes in the Night\\" (AKA \\"Arrive Alive\\"), \\"Cut and Run\\", and \\"Shock Treatment\\", and as a result, only four of the songs from the Atlantis Suite were presented in the original version of the album, and then not in the preferred running order, obscuring the original concept entirely. The excised songs were issued as B-sides and EP tracks. This frustrated many of the band's existing fans, since anyone who wanted to hear the entire Atlantis Suite would have to buy the album and all of the associated EPs and singles. The ultimate result was an album which satisfied nobody. The group felt that the album had been compromised, and their existing fans were annoyed that the album didn't present the intact Atlantis Suite as they had been expecting. New listeners found the Atlantis concept impossible to follow due to the missing songs and muddled running order of the remaining material, and EMI themselves were disappointed with the low sales of the album and the failure of the commercial songs to attract a wider audience. The album was eventually re-released on CD in 1992, under the Centaur Records label, with bonus tracks and a different running order; the commercial tunes the band recorded at EMI's behest are put at the start of the running order as a \\"warm- up\\", whilst the remainder of the album consists of the Atlantis Suite in its entirety, as originally recorded in 1984 and as the band intended it to be presented all along. The record has been re-released again in 2004 under the Insideout label on a numbered, special edition CD with added cd-rom content. In its August 2013 issue the British magazine Prog ran an article on the album in its series \\"The Albums that Saved Prog\\".

Career Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Sharman was a right-handed batter who began his professional baseball career in 1915, at the age of 20, for the Portsmouth Cobblers of the Class-D Ohio State League. He had five home runs in 103 games played, and had a .397 batting average in 393 at bats. In 1916, he moved up and began the season with the class-B Galveston Pirates of the Texas League (TL). After playing in 120 games for the Pirates, he promoted to the class-A Memphis Chickasaws of the Southern Association. He did not hit well for the Chickasaws in 1916, just a .132 batting average in 15 games, and he returned to the TL in 1917. He began the season with the Fort Worth Panthers, then later re-joined the Pirates. In total, he collected 203 hits, three home runs, and had a .341 batting average during the TL season. He signed with the Philadelphia Athletics toward the end of the Major League Baseball season in 1917. He made his debut with the team on September 10, playing in both games of a doubleheader against the New York Yankees. He played 13 games for the Philadelphia Athletics, batting .297 and collecting 11 hits, 2 doubles, a triple, 2 RBIs, a stolen base, and three walks. Military and death It was reported on November 3, 1917 that Sharman had enlisted into the United States Army in Cincinnati.

The park was designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who gave the design to the city on the condition it would be named after their mentor, Andrew Jackson Downing, a Newburgh native who had died in a steamboat accident on the Hudson River in 1852. History Most of Downing Park was a farm belonging to a family named Smith. The Smith's 1750s farmhouse stood at the present location of the pergola. The idea to build a park originated with Mayor Benjamin B. Odell in the late 1880s. The 25-acre Smith estate was acquired and later ten more acres were added. The City offered the design commission to Olmstead and Vaux, who delivered the plans in 1889. It was the last collaboration between the two. Vaux and Olmsted were well known for creating open spaces that promoted the well-being of the public, and they favored naturalistic, rustic, and curving landscape designs. Downing Park's 35-acres were designed to be a passive, contemplative environment in the center of the city. Construction started in 1894 and the park was opened in 1897. In addition to the farmhouse, the park originally featured an observatory and a band shell. The observatory, designed by Calvert's son Downing Vaux, rested on the highest point in the park, commanding spectacular Hudson River views. At the turn of century, the farmhouse was turned into a smallpox sanatorium. In 1908 the flu epidemic ended; the city condemned the house, and it was burned to the ground. Later that year, architect Frank Estabrook designed the pergola to be built on the farmhouse foundations. The band shell was removed in the 1920s; the observatory was torn down in 1961 as part of an \\"urban renewal\\" project.\\"History of Downing Park\\", City of Newburgh Today Downing Park, Newburgh, NY Downing Park is centrally located within the city, between Robinson Avenue (US 9W-NY 32) on the west, South Street on the north, Dubois Street on the east and Third Street to the south. Carpenter Avenue divides the park into an eastern and western half. The most prominent feature of the park is the pond and fountain in its southwest corner, known as the \\"polly.\\" In the early 20th century, it was a popular place for ice skating in the winter, but that has since been prohibited as pollution has made the water less capable of effectively freezing up in the winter. The Polly‚Äôs natural stone Shelter House, designed by local architect Gordon Marvel was added in 1934 and served as a place for visitors to change into skates and enjoy cups of hot chocolate during the cold winter months. It is now the headquarters of the Downing Park Planning Committee. To the east, the land rises to a small hill, the terrace, which overlooks the Hudson. Other amenities in the park include an amphitheater to the north of the polly, host to many local concerts and festivals in the summer months. =Flora and fauna= Downing Park is home to the only dedicated ornamental daylily garden in New York, donated and maintained by the Iris and Daylily Society.

Biography A native of Milford, Massachusetts, Kenney led Milford High School to a state baseball championship in 1932. He was a standout college baseball player at Holy Cross, where he posted a career 16‚Äì4 record and is a member of the school's athletic hall of fame. While at Holy Cross, Kenney played summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League, pitching for the league's Harwich team in 1937. In a 1938 exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox, he hurled four innings for Holy Cross, striking out Baseball Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx twice in a 3‚Äì2 upset win over the big leaguers. Kenney appeared in two major league games, pitching in relief twice for the Boston Bees (Braves) during their 1938 season under manager Casey Stengel. His first appearance came on July 1 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies at Braves Field. Kenney pitched the ninth inning in relief of Dick Errickson in the Braves' 5‚Äì0 loss. His second appearance came three days later on July 4 in the second game of another twin-bill with the Phillies, this time at Shibe Park. Kenney tossed 1 innings again in relief of Errickson as the Braves took another loss, 10‚Äì2. Over his two big league appearances, Kenney allowed three hits and four earned runs in 2 innings pitched for a 15.34 ERA. He recorded two strikeouts and eight walks, did not have a decision, and did not come to bat. Kenney served in the US Army Air Force during World War II.

He scored 2‚Äì03 against Meath in the final. He also won an Irish News Ulster All-Star award for his performances that year. In 2007 Freeman helped Monaghan reach the Ulster Senior Football Championship final, where they lost by two points to Tyrone (1-15 to 1-13). Freeman was top scorer in that year's Ulster Championship a total of 0-12. Monaghan however went on to reach the All-Ireland Championship quarter-final, where they met reigning champions Kerry. He cut his thumb in a work-related accident a few days before the match and he had to get a cast on, which was only removed two days before the match. He did however play in the game and scored 1-02, which Kerry won 1‚Äì12 to 11. Freeman finished the Championship with 4-22, the second highest scorer behind Cork's James Masters. He was awarded an All Star award for his performances that year and also named Irish News Ulster Player of the year. Freeman was very much a key player once again in 2008 for Monaghan. They were not as successful as the year before but Tommy still made many highly rated performances. Monaghan were often criticised for their heavy dependence on him and teammate Paul Finlay. This was a disappointing year as they once again went out to Kerry in the All-Ireland qualifiers after a great display against Derry in the previous round. He received an Ulster All-Star in 2008. In 2009 Monaghan made it to the division 2 league final in which they played Cork. Freeman was still Monaghan's best player in this year but received a 2 match ban for an incident where he tried to hit a Derry player in the Ulster Quarter Final. Freeman was sorely missed in their next 2 games against Armagh and Derry, although Monaghan made a fine display to beat 'The Orchard County' on a score of 0‚Äì13 to 012 after extra time but Banty's army fell short with Tommy still serving his 2 match ban during the encounter with 'The Oak Leaf County'. Freeman's tireless dedication to the Monaghan cause was finally rewarded in 2013 when he and the Monaghan team beat Donegal in the final of the Ulster Senior Football Championship to win the trophy.

Setting The Beni savanna covers an area of in the lowlands of northern Bolivia, with small portions in neighboring Brazil and Peru. Most of the Llanos de Moxos lies within the departments of El Beni, Cochabamba, La Paz, Pando, and Santa Cruz. The Llanos de Moxos occupies the southwestern corner of the Amazon basin, and the region is crossed by numerous rivers that drain the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains. The low relief of the savannas, coupled with wet season rains and snowmelt from the Andes, cause up to half the land to flood seasonally. The Beni savanna is surrounded by tropical moist forests; the Southwestern Amazonian moist forests to the north, west, and south, and the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests to the east. =Climate= The climate of the Beni savanna is tropical, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season generally extends from December to May, and annual rainfall ranges from 1300 in the east to 2000 mm in the west. Flora The ecoregion comprises a mosaic of savannas and wetlands, with islands of forest and gallery forests along rivers. Flooding and fire are important ecological factors. Fauna The ecoregion is home to the blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis), which is critically endangered. People The Llanos de Moxos was the setting for pre- Columbian agriculture, and appears to have been an early center of plant domestication. The inhabitants constructed agricultural earthworks: raised fields, causeways, canals, and about 4700 forested mounds over a 50,000 square kilometer area. Construction lasted from about 8850 BCE to about 1450 CE. Cultivation included manioc from about 8350 BCE, squash from about 8250 BCE, and maize from about 4,850 BCE. Several domestic crops, including manioc, squash, peanut, some varieties of chili and some beans, are genetically very close to wild species living in the Llanos de Moxos, suggesting that they were domesticated there.U.

Although Europeans arrived in South America in the late 15th century, they did not come to settle in the Llanos de Moxos until the late 17th century. The missions established by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries became many of the modern towns in the region. Since the 1950s, ranching has become the most important industry, and ranches dominate the landscape.

Bee Ho Gray (born Emberry Cannon Gray on April 7, 1885, in Leon, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory ‚Äì August 3, 1951, in Pueblo, Colorado) was a Western performer who spent 50 years displaying his skills in Wild West shows, vaudeville, circus, silent films, and radio. While he was primarily known as an expert at trick roping, he was also skilled with knife throwing, bullwhips (specifically the Australian black snake whip), trick riding, and the banjo. He wove all of these skills together in a homely comic routine. Throughout his long career, he was constantly compared to Will Rogers, which was befitting, considering the two performers worked together several times and developed their acts together in the early 1900s. Biography Emberry Cannon Gray was born on April 7, 1885, in Leon, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, in what is present-day Oklahoma. His family moved to the small town of Cache (near Fort Sill), Indian Territory, within two years of his birth. Bee Ho's mother was one-quarter Chickasaw; his father had been a Texas Ranger in the Trinity Division, and later served in the Confederate Army. Gray grew up among the Apache, Comanche, and Kiowa, as Cache was the commercial center of their territories. His brothers and he played with the children of Comanche Chief Quanah Parker, and his parents became good friends with the Parker family. By the time Emberry was five years old, he began going by the name \\"Bee Ho\\", a name meaning \\"Brother of the Cripple\\" given to him by Chief Quanah, because Bee Ho's brother, \\"Ho\\" Emmet Gray, was stricken with polio as a small boy and walked with a crutch for the remainder of his life. Bee Ho developed his Western skills on the plains of Indian Territory, but had never seen a real trick roper until about 1900. Bee Ho and his younger brother, Weaver, heard about the amazing tricks that were being performed by trick ropers in Wild West shows. Together, they rode 60 miles on one horse to the town of Chickasha to see the Pawnee Bill Wild West exhibition, making the trip in two days. They were very impressed with the trick ropers and began teaching themselves rope tricks, using clothesline and anything else they could spin. Within a few years, both were performing with Wild West shows. Both brothers enjoyed amazing 50-year careers in Western performance. During the early years of his career as a Western performer, Bee Ho performed with several Wild West shows. His first notable performances were with Colonel Cummins' Wild West Indian Congress and Rough Riders of the World at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, also known as the Saint Louis World's Fair. Other notable performers from this show include Geronimo, Will Rogers, Zach Mulhall, Lucille Mulhall, and a number of well-known Native American chiefs. Bee Ho joined the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West in 1907, its first year of touring the United States. Other famous people who performed with the 101 Ranch include Tom Mix, Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson, Buck Jones, Tex McLeod, Chester Byers, Iron Tail, \\"Buckskin Bessie\\" Herberg, Bill Pickett, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, Milt Hinkle, Billy Lorette, Luka Chkhartishvili (Prince Lucca), Art Acord, and Princess Wenona (Lillian Smith). While Will Rogers was never actually employed by the 101 Ranch, he spent a lot of time there visiting with friends and taking part in the informal roping contests and other events. Bee Ho and his wife, Broadway actress, equestrienne, and horse trainer Ada Sommerville, traveled with the 101 Ranch for most of the years 1907-1916, with occasional departures to perform with other shows and to compete in early rodeos. The Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Real Wild West toured from 1907‚Äì1916 and again from 1925-1931. Some of the many other shows with which Bee Ho performed include California Frank's All-Star Wild West (Frank Hafley), Irwin Brothers Cheyenne Frontier Days Wild West Show, Diamond Dick's Wild West, Barnum and Bailey Circus, Ringling Brothers Circus, Shrine Circus, and his own show, Bee Ho Gray's Wild West. Bee Ho learned the sign language and spoken language of various Native American tribes while growing up in Indian Territory. In about 1912, Bee Ho accompanied Sioux Chief Iron Tail to Washington, DC and New York, where Iron Tail modeled for sculptor James Earle Fraser as he worked on designs for the new buffalo nickel. The two men had been working together on Wild West shows prior to this time and Bee Ho traveled with Iron Tail to act as an interpreter and guide. Bee Ho won the World Champion Trick and Fancy Roper title at Guy Weadick's Winnipeg Stampede in 1913 when he displayed a rope catch that had never been seen before. The trick was called the \\"Three- Rope Catch\\" and involved catching a galloping horse and rider with three ropes -- (1) around the rider's torso, (2) around the horse's neck, and (3) all four legs of the horse. Bee Ho won the title from Tex McLeod and held it until 1916, when he lost it to Chester Byers. Bee Ho was the only person who could do the trick for several years. He later taught it to Will Rogers, who performed it in the 1922 silent film The Ropin' Fool. Bee Ho earned the championship again in the early 1920s when he competed at the Cheyenne Frontier Days and Pendleton Round-Up. Bee Ho Gray moved out of competitive roping by the mid-1920s to focus on his vaudeville and film career. Bee Ho Gray throwing knives at Erich von Stroheim on the set of Greed Bee Ho and Ada spent many years as Vaudeville performers with the B. F. Keith, Orpheum, and Western circuits. The show consisted of a comic banter that was delivered while performing intricate rope tricks, knife throwing, whip cracking, banjo, and horse dancing. Their show usually received top billing and was sought after across the country. The couple traveled to Europe to perform on several occasions. They maintained a packed schedule of performances and literally played thousands of venues and shows during their career. Bee Ho performed in Erich von Stroheim's Greed (film) in 1924. Though his performance was apparently cut from the film when the length was reduced by about 80%, his name still shows up on lists of actors who were in the film, but one of his feats of skill still appears in the film. During an argument between the two main characters (McTeague and Marcus), a knife is thrown and sticks into the wall next to the lead actor's face. According to a 1926 Cedar Rapids (Iowa) Republican newspaper article, \\"Erich von Storheim [sic] featured Gray in his famous picture, Greed because of his ability to throw a knife.\\" Bee Ho also performed in a number of more obscure early Western films from the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Bison Films, Monogram Pictures, and the Vitaphone Corporation ,including Hey! Hey! Westerner. In May and June 1922, Bee Ho and Ada Sommerville were featured in a Broadway musical called Red Pepper, which appeared at the Shubert Theatre. The stars of the show were the minstrel duo James McIntyre and Thomas Kurton Heath. The show then went on the road for one year, closing in North Dakota in June 1923. Bee Ho added a trained coyote named \\"Chink\\" to be part of his act in the early 1930s, and began making radio appearances with his witty Oklahoma comedy. He appeared on stage and on the radio with personalities such as Bing Crosby, Will Rogers, Fred Stone, Joe E. Brown (comedian), Mary Beth Hughes, Eddie Nugent, Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, and many others. Many of the Western stars who performed in the first half of the 1900s got their start with him at the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West as they saw their way of life on the open range disappearing. Ada Sommerville died in 1940 at the age of 68. Bee Ho continued with his act using other assistants to fill her role, but the days of vaudeville were over and his career was relegated to county fairs, small corporate events, and school benefits. During his career, Bee Ho gave command performances for at least four United States presidents, members of European royalty, and many diplomats and notables. He died in Pueblo, Colorado, on August 3, 1951, at the age of 66 while visiting his sister. Many of his fans, friends, and family members never knew what became of him.

The sea around it is the birthplace of terrible tropical typhoons, which spring up suddenly and sweep helpless ships onto the sharp cliffs, where they are dashed to pieces. And, before Japan tamed her tiger, if a few poor half-drowned sailors managed to land, they were usually captured by the savages who lived there and killed by them.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Burr was known as \\"Tom\\" to his friends. Press accounts throughout his life, as well as other memoirs, used this nickname, although many baseball references labeled him \\"Alex\\". Burr attended The Choate School (later Choate Rosemary Hall), where he was a star pitcher. He then went to Williams College, although he turned pro before he ever played a collegiate game. Burr made the New York Yankees roster as a pitcher under manager Frank Chance. However, his only game appearance for the Yankees (on April 21, 1914) came in center field. He had no fielding chances and did not have a plate appearance. Burr returned to Williams College after his pro career ended, although by some accounts he went into business instead of returning to school. He volunteered to serve in the war before ever graduating. He self-financed his trip to France where he volunteered as an ambulance driver before joining the aviation corps. He was killed shortly before the war ended in an airplane accident on October 12, 1918 while serving in the United States Army Air Service in Cazaux, France. After colliding with a fellow pilot, Burr's plane crashed into a lake in flames; his body was recovered after 12 days. He had been serving in France since November 1917 and was 24 years old at the time of his death. Burr was interred in American Expeditionary Forces Cemetery No. 29. During the years after the end of World War I, this cemetery was deconsecrated. Some of the bodies exhumed‚Äîincluding Burr's‚Äîwere repatriated. Tom Burr's final resting place became Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Chicago.

Alongside contemporaries Watchmen, The Crow, and The Dark Knight Returns, Faust was credited with popularizing the \\"deconstructed superheroes\\" genre and the notion \\"comics aren't just for kids.\\" One of the bestselling independent comics of the era, Faust issue 1 sold over 100,000 copies with later issues averaging 50,000 sales per issue, most of which sold through several printings and editions. The series featured strong graphic violence and sexual situations. The main series is known as \\"Faust: Love Of The Damned\\" and started publishing in 1987, with new issues being published irregularly, roughly once a year, or sometimes every two years. David Quinn completed a script in 1996 (when writing the proposal to sell the film). The gap between issues grew wider with time. Issue 13 was published in 2005. It then took seven years for the authors to deliver the two last issues, 14 and 15, which concluded the story 25 years after the first episode. In 2001, Lionsgate Films released the Stuart Gordon produced feature film adaptation \\"Faust: Love of the Damned\\". Plot summary In New York City, Beef and Hapi, two hitmen who work for a mysterious Mephistophelian crime boss known as \\"M\\", kill a drug dealer and his girlfriend. This violence is detailed in the newspaper articles of Ron Balfour, a journalist who meets Doctor Jade DeCamp in a cafe. Jade has been fired from Bellevue Hospital and is furious over the accidental death of her patient and secret lover, John Jaspers. After Jade leaves the cafe, she and Balfour are assaulted by a gang and a horn-masked figure, Faust, appears laughing and singing while he slaughters the street punks with a pair of retractable forearm talons. Jade realizes in horror that Faust is John Jaspers. Jaspers later wonders if he is spilled too much blood, or not enough. He, apparently hallucinating, sees demons everywhere. One night from his Brooklyn Heights mansion, M calls a radio station and requests to play the song \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\" repeatedly, saying it should be dedicated \\"From M to the new kid in town\\", Faust. Later, it is shown that M played a role in Jaspers' Bellevue treatment. M's criminal colleagues want him to unleash his secret \\"Project Assassin\\", to eliminate Faust, unaware that Faust is M's prized killer. Jaspers then regains his lost memories of being an assassin for M, as well as the rebellion that led to his supposed \\"death\\".

The Bucking Horse and Rider (BH&R;) is a registered trademark of the U.S. state of Wyoming. In 1936, Wyoming trademarked the image for the state's license plates. However, the state's usage of the logo can be traced back to as early as 1918. University of Wyoming news release. February 8, 2001. Wyoming is popularly known as the \\"Cowboy State,\\" in part because of the use of the bucking bronco as its symbol. The University of Wyoming at Laramie athletic teams are nicknamed the Cowboys and Cowgirls, both of which use the bucking horse and rider logo on their uniforms. Uniforms for the Wyoming National Guard serving in Europe during World War I featured the horse and rider symbol. First Sergeant George N. Ostrom of E Battery, 3rd Battalion, 148th Field Artillery Regiment 91st Division, American Expeditionary Forces, is credited with designing the insignia. According to references in military records of the 91st Division, Ostrom manipulated a horse named Red Wing, which he had bought near Crow Agency, Montana, into the Army remuda with the assistance of Army Horse Purchasing Officer Chester Cotton of Sheridan. Once the soldiers and the horse reached the post outside Cheyenne, Major Louabaugh selected the horse as his mount, only to have it start bucking when the two bears used as mascots entered the parade ground. Chester Cotton and George Ostrum were detailed to remedy the horse's behavior. Ostrum used his memory of Chester Cotton subsequently riding Red Wing to win a slogan contest for the unit once in Europe. The horse survived World War I and was retired to a stable in France. The idea that the horse in the image was Old Steamboat (1894‚Äì1914), the famous bucking horse near Cheyenne, was developed much later, as few civilians saw the event depicted by Ostrum. The incident was documented with citations in the book Where Rivers Run North by Sam Morton.Sheridan Historical Society and 91st Division archives The slogan, \\"Powder River ‚Äî Let 'er Buck\\" and was taken into the trenches as a password and counter-password by troops from that unit in Europe. Descendants of those soldiers were still serving with the Wyoming National Guard in 2014. The silhouette of the horse and rider is still in use today on uniforms of the Wyoming National Guard soldiers. Clayton Danks, a Nebraska native who died in 1970 in Thermopolis, Wyoming, is believed to be the cowboy on the Bucking Horse and Rider model. He rode Steamboat in the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo in 1909. Wyoming State Quarter The iconic horse Steamboat came from the Tyrrell ranch near Chugwater, Wyoming, northwest of Cheyenne, and was given to Cheyenne Frontier Days by its former general chairman, Ace V. Tyrrell. Steamboat is buried on Frontier Park grounds near bucking chute #9, the only animal ever given the honor of being interred on park grounds. In 1975, Steamboat was inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, in 1979, into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs and in 2002 into the Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame. Wyoming sought to counter rampant counterfeiting of the state's license plate when it debuted the horse and rider image in 1936 as part of its license plate design. It is now the longest-running license plate motif in the world. Secretary of State Lester Hunt spearheaded legislation for the new design and commissioned artist Allen T. True to render the graphic image. True is also noted for painting murals for the Senate and House chambers in the Wyoming State Capitol. True's bucking horse and rider image is also on the logo for the University of Wyoming, on the Wyoming state quarter, and on the state highway shield.

It stars Jill Schoelen, Tom Villard, Dee Wallace, and Derek Rydall.  Plot  Film student and aspiring screenwriter Maggie Butler (Jill Schoelen) has recurring dreams of a young girl named Sarah who is caught in a fire and being chased by a strange man who is trying to kill her. She records what she remembers on an audiotape and plans on making the story into a film. Maggie lives with her mother Suzanne (Dee Wallace Stone), who has been receiving demonic prank calls. On her way to class, Maggie shuns the advances of her boyfriend Mark (Derek Rydall), explaining that she can't be distracted from writing her script. Maggie's classmate Toby D'Amato (Tom Villard) has an idea to put on an all-night horror movie marathon to raise funds for the university's film department. They set up shop in the defunct Dreamland theater, which is to be razed in three weeks. Professor Davis (Tony Roberts) is concerned about the time constraints, but Toby enlists the help of Dr. Mnesyne (Ray Walston), an owner of a film memorabilia shop with deploying promotional gimmicks. There are three main films within a film:Muir (2011), p. 170-172 Mosquito is a 3D film, The Attack of the Amazing Electrified Man uses a \\"Shock-o-Scope\\" gimmick (electrical \\"buzzers\\" in seats), and The Stench uses Odorama.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 As they go through Dr. Mnesyne's trunks of equipment, they find a short cult film called Possessor, that greatly resembles Maggie's dreams. Davis informs them Lanyard Gates, the film's director, killed his own family while shooting the final scene before setting the theater on fire, trapping the audience inside. Maggie soon becomes obsessed with Possessor and tries to figure out why she has been dreaming about it. When she asks her mother if she has heard of Gates or Possessor, Suzanne becomes uncomfortable; she urges Maggie to quit the festival and wants them to go away together. After Maggie goes to bed, Suzanne receives another prank call from someone she believes to be Gates. He tells her to meet him at Dreamland so they can talk and advises her to bring a gun. On the night of the festival, Maggie is working the box office when Mark arrives with another girl, Joy (Karen Witter). Later, a man buys a ticket and calls Maggie \\"Sarah\\" before he walks away. Unable to find the man in the theater, Maggie goes to the projection booth to tell Toby that she thinks she saw Gates. Meanwhile, Mark has left his date to sneak up on Maggie and Davis prepares the giant mosquito model to fly across the theater that he operates with a remote control. Once the mosquito is released above the audience, a figure in the catwalks above Davis, using another remote control, uses the mosquito to stab Davis in the chest with the stinger. The scene cuts to a laboratory where a figure is seen making a mask of Davis's face. As the second film starts, Bud (Malcolm Danare), who is wheelchair-bound, prepares the seat shockers from a control panel above the audience. Maggie listens to her audio recordings when the tape is cut off with a message from Gates. As she tries to exit the box office, she opens the door on Mark, knocking him down and unknowingly smashing the recorder in the process. Meanwhile, Maggie's classmate Tina finds Davis on the catwalk and goes up to meet him; it is revealed that they have been having an affair. She is unaware that the killer is posing as the professor, and is strangled with rope. Mark and Maggie find her shortly thereafter, but the killer manipulates her voice and body in the darkness to make it look like she is still alive. The killer straps Bud into a makeshift electric chair that is set to go off when a series of lights comes on. As he is electrocuted, the theater loses power. Maggie finds her way to Bud, only to find him dead and Gates confronting her. As Maggie flees, she realizes that she is Sarah Gates, Lanyard is her father, and Suzanne is her aunt who saved her from being killed so long ago. She runs into Toby and tells him everything she remembers, believing that Gates has returned for her.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 She and Toby enter the basement and Toby falls, disappearing into the darkness. With only a flashlight, Maggie thinks she sees Davis and Tina, but runs into Gates. The power comes back on and Maggie finds herself in the killer's lair, strapped into the chair he uses to make facial masks of his victims. The killer is revealed to be Toby, who was badly burned as a child after attending the showing of Possessor with his mother. Toby's mother as a member of Gates' film cult and was killed in the fire. Toby holds Maggie and Suzanne responsible for his loss, and plans to exact his revenge on them by re-enacting the final scene of Possessor onstage that evening, only with the ending that Gates had originally intended. He then wheels out Suzanne, whom he has cast full-body, pointing her gun. Meanwhile, Cheryl and Joanie (Ivette Soler) tend to Mark's injuries as they are met with an upset Joy, who tells Mark she saw Maggie and Toby together and that they went back to Toby's place. Mark leaves to find them and Joanie realizes she is late for her Odorama cue and goes to join Leon (Elliott Hurst) to activate the odor pellets during the third film. Leon leaves to go to the bathroom and is met by a mirror image of himself at the next urinal. After urinating on him, the doppelganger attacks Leon and locks him in one of the stalls and drops some type of material into the toilet that creates a thick smoke and Leon passes out. Soon after, there is an explosion from the stall and Leon is killed. Toby returns to the booth dressed as Leon with the plan to stab Joanie from behind, but spares her when she mentions her unrequited love for Toby. Shocked by this, Toby gets upset and storms out to continue setting up for the final scene of Possessor. Mark arrives at Toby's apartment to find that the landlord is evicting Toby. Toby's walls are plastered with articles concerning the incident, pictures of his facial reconstruction, and pictures of Maggie with scissors through her eyes. Realizing she is in real danger, Mark rushes back to the theater but the front doors are locked. He scales the building, climbs through a window on the balcony level and finds the final scene of Possessor playing on stage. Maggie has been drugged and placed in a metal dress so she has no mobility except for her head. She pleads to the audience to save her, but they believe this is all part of the show. Mark uses his belt on the mosquito track and zip-lines onto the stage, causing the secured mosquito to unlatch and swing out across the stage. The stinger stabs Toby in the chest, killing him. Mark releases Maggie and Suzanne as the crowd erupts in applause.

Ormsby was replaced by Porky's actor Mark Herrier a few weeks into filming. The original lead Amy O'Neill was replaced by Jill Schoelen at this time as well. Ormsby is credited with directing all three of the main films within a film, while Herrier is credited with filming the present-day portions of the film.Muir (2011), p. 170-172  Analysis  According to John Kenneth Muir, the title reflects a trend in the horror films of the 1990s. There were few colorful titles, none as flamboyant as examples of previous decades such as The Last House on the Left (1972), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Instead most film titles were generic and simple. Besides Popcorn, he cites titles such as The Guardian (1990), The Crush (1993), The Temp (1993), Hideaway (1995), and Scream (1996).Muir (2011), p. 10-11 He believes this trend was a result of the studio desire for generic, wide-appeal films.Muir (2011), p. 10-11 Muir believes the film itself was part of another trend of the time. Horror films which were both postmodernist films and self-reflective. Popcorn took inspiration from the history of the horror films, from the 1950s onwards. While Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995) used metafiction as one of their themes.Muir (2011), p. 10-11 Muir found the films-within-a-film to be more interesting than the frame story. He found them to be a realistic homage to the low-budget horror film of the 1950s and to the gimmicks of William Castle.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 Mosquito has similarities to the films of Jack Arnold. Nuclear weapons testing has caused desert mosquitoes to grow into giant monsters, in a plot resembling Them! (1954) and The Deadly Mantis (1957). The film includes stock characters and situations, such as a dedicated lady scientist and the military insisting on using a nuclear weapon to annihilate the monster.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The gimmick accompanying Mosquito is a life-sized version of the giant mosquito which slides down a rope above the heads of the film audience. This is a tribute to Emergo, the Castle-devised gimmick accompanying House on Haunted Hill (1959). The original gimmick featured a glowing skeleton sliding down a rope.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The title of The Attack of the Amazing Electrified Man seems to be a homage to The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), while the visual style of this film is similar to the works of William Cameron Menzies. It includes influences from German Expressionism, with \\"exaggerated shadows and menacing low-angles\\".Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The accompanying gimmick, \\"Shock-o-Scope\\", seems to be a rename of Percepto, the electric gimmick which accompanied The Tingler (1959).Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The Stench is fashioned after Japanese films, imported and dubbed for the American market. Its accompanying gimmick is an obvious variation of Smell-O-Vision, the gimmick used in Scent of Mystery (1960).Muir (2011), p. 170-172 Stranger than them is the Possessor. It features extreme close-ups, and functions as a mix between a snuff film and a product of Psychedelia. Its protagonist Lanyard Gates has similarities to cult leader Charles Manson.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The frame story is instead a rather typical slasher film. The killer impersonates his victims through use of masks, and his goal is the performance of a snuff-show in front of a live audience. His motivation lies in a crime of the past which scarred him for life. Maggie serves as the final girl of the film, accompanied by a heroic boyfriend. As to the identity of the killer, the film employs a suitable red herring for misdirection.Muir (2011), p. 170-172 Muir observes, however, that the film does not use slasher films themselves as part of its self-reflecting depiction of the horror genre. The characters don't seem aware of the relevant tropes, nor do they seem aware of their presence in a slasher film-like situation. Unlike their counterparts in Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997).Muir (2011), p. 170-172 The film includes a scene hinting at supernatural horror, which seems out of place in this film and is never properly explained. Suzanne, Maggie's mother, arrives at Dreamland to confront Lanyard Gates, gun in hand. As if in response, the letters of the movie theater's marquee fall on the ground and in their place appears a new sign: Possessor. Actually no character in this film, including the killer has the ability to do something like this.Muir (2011), p. 170-172  Release  = Box office = The film was not a box office success. The film opened in 8th place its debut weekend with a tally of $2,563,365 from just over 1,000 screens. It ended its domestic box office run with $4,205,000. = Home video = Popcorn was initially released on home video in June 1991. Variety reported in 1993 that home video sales equaled $2,043,179. Elite Entertainment released a DVD edition of Popcorn in 2001. Special features include theatrical trailers, TV spots and promotional footage. A Region A (US/Canada) Blu-ray/DVD combo was released through Synapse Films on March 7, 2017.  Reception  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film reports that 37% of 19 critics gave the film positive reviews. John Kenneth Muir identified two distinct films in Popcorn: one is a smart, postmodern film that \\"self-reflexively gazes back at genre conventions and gimmickry\\", and the other a rather derivative revival of 1980s slashers that lacks the self- awareness and intelligence of the more postmodern half. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"the best spoof of its kind since Alligator.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it an \\"ingenious and spoofy little shocker\\" and \\"A Nifty Tribute to Its Genre\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it B and wrote, \\"Though it isn't even trying to scare you, this is a very nifty black-comic horror movie, one of the rare entries in the genre with some genuine wit and affection.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote that it \\"has several good ideas that, unfortunately, go unrealized.\\" Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote, \\"Popcorn isn't too clever by half, but only by seven-sixteenths. It's so busy being droll and ironic it forgets to be any good.\\" Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote, \\"On the whole, \\"Popcorn\\" is so amateurish in its development, with pseudo-hip dialogue that drops movie references every few lines, it winds up being neither scary nor funny.\\" Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote that the film spoofs were inspired, but the rest of the film is much worse. Reviewing the 2001 DVD release, Adam Tyner of DVD Talk called it \\"a wildly entertaining movie\\", and Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict called it \\"a fun little flick.\\" Despite the film's mixed reception, it has gained a \\"cult following\\" since its release.

They lived in south central Beni Department, on both banks of the Mamore River, and on the marshy plains to its west, known as the Llanos de Mojos. The Mamore is a tributary to the Madeira River in northern Bolivia. Moje√±os were traditionally hunter-gatherers, as well as farmers and pastoralists.. Jesuit missionaries established towns in the Mojos plains beginning in 1682, converting native peoples to Catholicism and establishing a system of social organization that would endure well beyond the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767 Block, David (1994). Mission Culture on the Upper Amazon: Native Tradition, Jesuit Enterprise and Secular Policy in Moxos, 1660-1880; Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press.. Moje√±o ethnic identification derives from a process of ethnogenesis as a result of this encounter between a number of pre-existing ethnic groups in this mission environment. This process occurred in several different mission towns, resulting in distinct Moje√±o identities, including Moje√±o-Trinitarios (Trinidad mission), Moje√±o-Loretanos (Loreto mission), Moje√±o-Javerianos, and Moje√±o-Ignacianos (San Ignacio de Moxos mission). They numbered some 30,000 in the first decade of the 20th century. Many Moje√±o communities are affiliated with the Central de Pueblos Ind√≠genas del Beni and/or the Central de Pueblos √âtnicos Moje√±os del Beni. Language In addition to Spanish, many Moje√±o people speak one of several indigenous languages, belonging to the Arawakan language family, including Ignaciano language. In many communities, the language is used in daily life and taught in beginning primary school grades. A dictionary of Ignaciano Moje√±o has been published, and the New Testament was translated into the language in 1980. Name They are also known as Mojos, Moxos or Moxe√±os. History =Moxos Before the Jesuits= The previous inhabitants of the region, which before the independence of Bolivia was a single territory called Mojos, were the aboriginal Itonama, Cayuvava, Canichana, Tacanam and Movima. Afterwards, the Moxos or the Moxe√±os arrived. The Moxos were from the Arawak ethnic group, an ethnic group which developed a more complex culture between the Amazon rainforest and the Llanos. For unknown reasons, between the 15th Century B.C. and the 8th Century B.C., agricultural Arawak groups from the lowlands (present-day Surinam) abandoned their lands and migrated to the west and south, bringing with them a tradition of incised ceramics. The Moxos, who were part of this population stream, built irrigation canals and crop terraces as well as ritual sites. Thousands of years before the Common Era, the Arawak also migrated north and populated the islands of the Caribbean Sea. This slow expansion resulted in their arrival at the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola (present-day island of the Dominican Republic and Haiti). Pottery pieces found in the countryside of the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and even in the present-day precinct of the city Santa Cruz de la Sierra, reveal that the region was populated by an Arawak tribe (known as the Chan√©) with a ceramic- making culture. Writers such as Diego Felipe de Alcaya, tell of a group living between the last buttresses of the Andes Mountains and the central arm of the Guapay River. The communities all throughout this great plain region and along the banks of the river were established and allied under the superior command of a leader, whom Alcaya describes with the title of king. This king, called by the dynastic name of Grigot√°, had a comfortable dwelling and wore a vividly-colored shirt. Chiefs (caciques), named as Goligoli, Tundi, and Vitupu√©, were subordinate to Grigot√° and had control of hundreds of warriors. As a result, the first Jesuits in Moxos encountered a developed, ancient civilization. Thousands and thousands of artificial hills up to 60 feet high dotted the landscape, along with hundreds of artificial rectangular ponds up to three feet deep, all part of a system of cultivation and irrigation. The people used the built-up high ground for farming and dug canals to unite ponds and rivers that caught water in this flood-prone region. All these architectural and structural masterpieces can be attributed to the ancestors of the present-day Moxe√±os, who include the Arawak, the most extensive ethnic group in the area. The Moxos language belongs to a language family called Arawakan. The Arawak have always been famous architects, and indeed the great hydraulic works (dated to ca. 250 CE) of their ancient empire is located in the territory of Moxos. Even today one speaks of the \\"Amazonian cultures\\" as a block, despite the differences between the various peoples. The Amazonian cosmos includes a tripartite world: the sky above, the earth here, and the underworld below. These cultures believe that the earth is controlled by a father creator, in collaboration with created spirits or due√±os, masters, of places or things and with ancestors who help to maintain justice and balance. Slipping from the norm brings about a spiritual sickness that is cured by a communal search for the cause and by a variety of religious rituals, including prayers and natural remedies. In Moxos the principal due√±os are the spirits of the jungle (connected with the tiger) and of the water (connected with the rainbow). Many rich dances renew the life of the community and the universe. =Jesuit mission era= Jesuit priests arriving from Santa Cruz de la Sierra began evangelizing native peoples of the region in the 1670s. They set up a series of missions near the Mamor√© River for this purpose beginning with Loreto. The principal mission was established at Trinidad in 1686. The Jesuit missionaries who first encountered the Moxe√±os found a people with a strong belief in God as father and creator. The Jesuits accepted in their catechism the names the indigenous peoples gave to God in their own languages, trying to embrace all aspects of the culture not contrary to Christian faith or custom.http://www.companysj.com/v153/returntosanignacio.html See also * Moxos Province Notes * External links *Mehin√°ku material culture, National Museum of the American Indian *Moxos Indians at the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia. *\\"The Amazon and Madeira Rivers: Sketches and Descriptions from the Note-Book of an Explorer\\" is a book from 1875 that has a chapter about the Moxo people.

She was first named after William G. Sumner, a classical liberal American social scientist. She was renamed and commissioned after Alkaid, a star in the Big Dipper asterism or constellation Ursa Major. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction William G. Sumner was laid down on 13 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1211, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; she was sponsored by Mrs. William R. McQuaid, a prominent citizen of Jacksonville, and launched on 8 November 1943. She was acquired by the US Navy, under a bareboat charter on 19 November 1943, and renamed Alkaid. She was converted for naval service by the Gibbs Gas Engine Co., Jacksonville, and commissioned in Jacksonville, on 27 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander Edward G. Gummer in command. Service history Following a period of shakedown training off the US East Coast, Alkaid sailed on 6 May 1944, for the Pacific Ocean, via Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal. On 14 June, the ship touched at Espiritu Santo and reported to Service Squadron 8 for duty. For the duration of her World War II service, Alkaid acted as an interisland transport. Some of the ports she visited included Noumea, New Caledonia; Guadalcanal; Tulagi; Suva, Fiji; Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand; Efate, New Hebrides; Oro Bay, New Guinea; Iwo Jima; Guam; and Eniwetok. On 15 May 1945, Alkaid sailed from Ulithi, with a convoy bound for Okinawa. She arrived off Hagushi beach on 21 May, and operated there through the end of the month. Alkaid touched at Pearl Harbor in early August. She was undergoing availability when she received word of the Japanese surrender. In September, the ship got underway for Japan. After making calls at Eniwetok, Saipan, and Iwo Jima, Alkaid dropped anchor at Yokosuka, Japan, on 4 October. For the next one and one-half months, the ship served with the occupation forces in Japan. On 16 November, Alkaid left Japan with a load of homeward-bound American troops and reached Long Beach, California, on 9 December 1945. On 4 January 1946, Alkaid departed Long Beach for San Francisco, California, arriving on 6 January 1946. Decommissioning The ship was decommissioned there and returned to the Maritime Commission (MARCOM) on 11 March 1946, and entered the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Alkaid was stricken from the Navy list on 28 March 1946. Resuming the name William G. Sumner, the ship remained in reserve into the 1960s. She was sold for scrapping to the National Metal & Steel Corp., on 31 March 1964, for $52,609.15. She was removed from the fleet by the purchaser on 20 April 1964.

It is notable for its position on the Diendorf fault line and for its immediate vicinity to the site of one of the most significant Celtic settlements in Central Europe, situated on the southern slopes of the nearby Sandberg ridge towards the neighboring village of Roseldorf. History The Platt area shows signs of human habitation that date back to late neolithic (Funnelbeaker culture) and early Bronze Age (Unetice culture) times. Prehistoric culture reached its peak during the early and middle La T√®ne period, around 300 B.C., when the large (20-40 ha) Sandberg Celtic city existed here on the southern slopes of the nearby Sandberg ridge. Systematic archeological excavations that have been ongoing since 2001 continue to reveal information on this recently recognized and highly significant settlement from the Iron Age, which at its climax comprised at least 450 buildings and included a halidom district with several cult sites. The preserved tower of Platt's old parish church. The new church is visible in the background on the left The village of Platt was first documented in 1185 (as Plade), and grew from 56 buildings in 1590 to 187 in 1850, when the population reached 1,202 and the village became an independent administrative community. From this time onward the headcount dropped continually, reaching a minimum of 398 in 1991 and rising only marginally as a result of weekend residences being built, mainly by citizens of Vienna which is about away to the southeast. In 1967, the local administration of Platt was moved to Zellerndorf. Only the tower, strongly modified in the 18th century, is left from Platt's original parish church, which was dedicated to St. Ulrich and traces back to a chapel erected between 1430 and 1440. The much larger new church was completed in 1850. It contains two oil paintings by Paul Troger, a famous artist from the Baroque period. The first decades of the 19th century were an unfortunate time for Platt. The village burned twice (in 1811 and again in 1827), followed by a cholera epidemic in 1832. The Diendorf fault line and the vanished castle Platt is situated on one of the most active segments of the Diendorf fault, a geological disturbance traversing Lower Austria from Wieselburg and Melk to Mautern, Krems and Maissau, then continues northward towards the Czech border. Its movements do not primarily result in earthquakes but rather in the slow but constant formation of subterranean clefts and cavities which destabilize the ground and cause significant damage even to major buildings with strong foundations. Occasionally large cavities collapse and take entire surface structures down with them, as happened with parts of a vineyard in 1942. This might be the reason for the unexplained disappearance of a building of local significance (sometimes referred to as a castle) which was independently documented by several sources in the early 17th century but was gone by the 1670s, apparently without leaving permanent traces. It has been suggested that the building became a victim of the Diendorf fault, but it is also possible that it was destroyed by invading Swedish troops during the final phase of the Thirty Years' War: in 1645, the headquarters for Swedish army operations in Lower Austria had been established in the immediate vicinity, at the castle of Schrattenthal. Economy and infrastructure Platt's economy is essentially agricultural, mostly based on wine, but recently significant areas have been dedicated to pumpkins (the Styrian variety cultivated for their highly valued seed oil) and sunflowers. The second most important element is tourism. There is a direct and well- served train connection linking Platt to Austria's capital, Vienna and to Znojmo immediately across the Czech border. Bus connections are available to Retz.

Photo by Mikhail Evstafiev The Presidential Palace in Grozny was a building in the center of the Chechen capital Grozny. The building became a symbol of resistance for the supporters of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria during the early stages of the conflict in Chechnya. The building was ruined by repeated artillery and air strikes. The Russians demolished it completely in 1996 for good. History The 11-floor building was originally the headquarters of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Eventually General Dzhokhar Dudayev, the first leader of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, adopted it as his presidential palace and the main seat of his government (Dudayev's actual office was on the eighth floor of the building). During the brief period of de-facto independence (November 1991-February 2000) from Russia the square outside the building was named in honour of Sheikh Mansur. =Chechen War= A Chechen fighter near the burned-out presidential palace during a short lull in fighting in Grozny, January 1995. Photo by Mikhail Evstafiev The palace was the target of abortive attacks by the Russian-supported Chechen opposition forces through 1994 but was not targeted in the initial Russian bombing campaign. During the early phase of the 1994‚Äì1995 Battle of Grozny the palace was the primary objective of the disastrous New Year's Eve assault by the Russian forces, the place where all columns of the Russian armour were supposed to meet after advancing from various directions, as well as the further Russian attacks. The soldier who would raise the flag of Russia over the building was promised to have become a Hero of the Russian Federation and the Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev even claimed his forces captured it during the initial storming. Although Dudayev left Grozny early in the battle, the massive concrete structure of his presidential palace turned into the main Chechen stronghold in the city. It, together with the surrounding buildings, was fiercely defended by several hundred separatist fighters, including some of Dudayev's presidential guards and the battalion of Shamil Basayev. The basement under the palace became the battle headquarters of Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen chief of staff, shared with a field hospital and an improvised prisoner-of-war camp for captured Russian soldiers. Sergei Kovalev (Boris Yeltsin's human rights commissioner), six other State Duma deputies, as well as several journalists and aid workers (including Viktor Popkov) were also trapped in the bunker for days following the initial Russian attack. The Russian forces shelled the building for nearly three weeks, scoring hundreds of direct artillery hits, including with mortars, point-blank tank fire and a particularly devastating salvo of BM-21 rockets. They deployed thousands of troops for some two weeks of fierce fighting that completely destroyed many of the municipal buildings and houses near the palace and reduced it to little more than a gutted shell. Eventually, by January 16 the Russians managed to surround the burning building on three sides (the fourth being the Sunzha River), but still failed to dislodge the defenders. On January 17, 1995, two enormous nine-ton bunker buster bombs were dropped, in a rare instance of the use of precision-guided munitions by the Russian Air Force in Chechnya. One of them penetrated the building and exploded in the underground hospital, killing at least 50‚Äì60 people including many of the prisoners; the second one, which landed just metres from Maskhadov's command post, failed to explode and Maskhadov escaped unhurt. After midnight on January 18, the ruined building was abandoned by the last defenders, who crossed a bridge to the other side of the river under cover of darkness, and was finally seized by the Russians the next day. The site was a scene of a massive peace demonstration in February 1996. The rally ended in bloodshed when the Russian government forces fired on the demonstrators, killing several people.Chechens demonstrate on bullet- ridden Presidential Palace The Russians then completely demolished the ruins soon afterwards for good. =After the wars and Reconstruction= The site where the building once stood is now the site of the Akhmat Kadyrov square. With funds from the Federal Government the area has been redeveloped. It is now home to the Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque, the second largest in Russia.

The exact location is not known, but in an anonymous Bulgarian chronicle, it is mentioned that the armies of Michail Asen engaged the invading forces before they could reach Sofia.  Origins of the conflict  After the Ottoman Turks seized their first fortress in the Balkans in 1352, they quickly began to expand their territory in Europe. From the year 1354, their raiding parties began looting in Bulgarian Thrace, ravaging the regions of Plovdiv and Stara Zagora, and in the following year launched a campaign against the key city of Sofia.  The battle  The son of the Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander, Michail Asen, summoned an army to stop the advancing enemy. The battle was fierce, the Bulgarians suffered heavy casualties and their commander and heir to the throne was killed. However, the Ottoman losses were also heavy and they were unable to continue their march on Sofia.  Aftermath  The battle showed that the Bulgarians were not ready to challenge the Turks in an open field battle and the loss of their eldest and allegedly most capable son was a great blow for the Bulgarians and their Emperor. But the battle and his death were not in vain: the Ottomans were able to reach Sofia 30 years later in 1382. But during that time, the Bulgarians could not prevent them from taking over the whole Thrace.

The Jorkens stories, primarily fantasy but also including elements of adventure, mystery and science fiction literature, have been collected in a series of six books, and were a key inspiration for the \\"fantastic club tale\\" type of short story. Development =Origins= In the middle volume of his autobiographical trilogy, While the Sirens Slept, Dunsany notes the creation of Mr Jorkens, on the 29 and 30 March in 1925, when \\"I wrote a tale called The Tale of the Abu Laheeb. There was in this tale more description of the upper reaches of the White Nile or of the Bahr-el-Gazal than I have given here; indeed the whole setting of that fantastic story may be regarded as accurately true to life, though not the tale itself. I mention this short story and the date, because it was the first time that I told of the wanderings of a character that I called Jorkens. He was my reply to some earlier suggestion that I should write of my journeys after big game and, being still reluctant to do this, I had invented a drunken old man who, whenever he could cadge a drink at a club, told tales of his travels.\\" \\"The Tale of the Abu Laheeb\\", the first Jorkens story, was published in the July 1926 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, with illustrations. =Later development= Over the following 32 years, Dunsany continued to write of Mr. Jorkens, and the stories were popular and sold well, mostly initially to magazines (many enjoying wide circulation, from the Atlantic Monthly, Saturday Evening Post and Vanity Fair to the Pall Mall Gazette, The Strand and The Spectator) and newspapers (including The Daily Mail and The Irish Independent), and also in their collected book form. Some of the stories were read on radio, and they were popular enough that for at least one announcement of a new book, an introductory piece by Lord Dunsany was included in the publisher's house magazine. A total of 154 stories are included in the Collected Jorkens edition. It has been rumoured at literary conventions that one or two further uncollected (or even unpublished) pieces may remain. Some of the stories bear different titles in their periodical appearances than in the books (the book titles are apparently those Dunsany gave the stories, and he was strongly opposed to any changes to the stories or their titles), and were accompanied by sketches in both colour and black-and-white. The Jorkens oeuvre contains the story which introduced the futuroscope, a device later the subject of a whole Dunsany novel, and one of the last short stories Dunsany wrote. The last two Jorkens stories were written in 1957, in February and August; the author died in October. Style and settings The Jorkens stories are usually told in the \\"frame\\" of a gentlemen's club in London, to which the narrator is invited in the first story, and of which he becomes a member. In general, Jorkens is sitting, and his attention is caught by someone else trying to tell a story, whereupon he provides a better story, in return, before or after or both, for whiskey. The stories often contain a \\"sting\\", with Jorkens appearing to do something remarkable, or get rich, but missing out in the end, but in their lightness often also touch on bigger themes. The stories take place in a wide range of settings, most often in the UK and Ireland and parts of Africa, as well as India, and are of varied character. Some of the early stories are notably lengthy, while most of the later are shorter, some just a few pages. A recurrent sceptical character, Terbut, often provokes their telling while the narrator (Dunsany himself) tends to be sympathetic. =Club tales= Dunsany's Jorkens stories, themselves in the tradition of such tall tales as those featuring Baron Munchausen, essentially established the genre of the fantastic tall club tale or bar tale. The \\"club tale\\" format itself was not new; at the time of Jorkens' first appearance in December 1926, P. G. Wodehouse had already published numerous stories about The Oldest Member and about Mr. Mulliner, both of whom would tell tall tales in a club or bar setting. However, the element of fantasy was a new wrinkle, and would inspire such disparate later descendants as L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt's Tales from Gavagan's Bar, Arthur C. Clarke's Tales from the White Hart (specifically acknowledged by Clarke in his introduction to the first Jorkens omnibus volume) and Sterling E. Lanier's Brigadier Ffellowes stories, as well as Rhys Hughes's Tallest Stories, Larry Niven's Draco Tavern stories, Isaac Asimov's Black Widowers and Union Club mysteries, Spider Robinson's tales of Callahan's Place, and even the animated cartoon series \\"The World of Commander McBragg\\" and \\"Mater's Tall Tales.\\" Typically, the club tale features one particular raconteur notorious for his colourful history and unbelievable reminiscences, who relates memoirs of his life to initially incredulous fellow club members; by the end of the story the latter usually at least believe the unlikely tale, and count the experience well worth the expense. Major variations include a recurring cast of club members or bar regulars with the story-teller being an outsider, non-fantastic (but still interesting) tales, or settings that are themselves fantastic, rendering the tales themselves more believable within their fictional context. The format has proven endlessly adaptable, with notable instances to be found in the science fiction (Clarke and Robinson) and mystery (Asimov) genres as well as fantasy. P.G. Wodehouse's Mr. Mulliner and Oldest Member stories are (comparatively) non-fantastical examples of the club tale. Image Jorkens was pictured a number of times, both in magazine and newspaper graphics as well as inside the collected volumes and on dust jackets; these depictions varying considerably. Among the more famous illustrations are those by Dunsany's favourite artist, Sidney Sime, which are, unusually for Sime, done in colour. The originals of these illustrations, which exist for at least the first three Jorkens stories, are still available to see at Dunsany Castle.

The nuclear envelope consists of two lipid bilayer membranes, an inner nuclear membrane & an outer nuclear membrane. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space. It is usually about 20‚Äì40 nm wide. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The nuclear envelope has many nuclear pores that allow materials to move between the cytosol and the nucleus. Intermediate filament proteins called lamins form a structure called the nuclear lamina on the inner aspect of the inner nuclear membrane and gives structural support to the nucleus. Structure The nuclear envelope is made up of two lipid bilayer membranes. An inner nuclear membrane and an outer nuclear membrane. These membranes are connected to each other by nuclear pores. Two sets of intermediate filaments provide support for the nuclear envelope. An internal network forms the nuclear lamina on the inner nuclear membrane. A looser network forms outside to give external support. =Outer membrane= The outer nuclear membrane also shares a common border with the endoplasmic reticulum. While it is physically linked, the outer nuclear membrane contains proteins found in far higher concentrations than the endoplasmic reticulum. All four nesprin proteins (nuclear envelope spectrin repeat proteins) present in mammals are expressed in the outer nuclear membrane. Nesprin proteins connect cytoskeletal filaments to the nucleoskeleton. Nesprin-mediated connections to the cytoskeleton contribute to nuclear positioning and to the cell‚Äôs mechanosensory function. KASH domain proteins of Nesprin-1 and -2 are part of a LINC complex (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) and can bind directly to cystoskeletal components, such as actin filaments, or can bind to proteins in the perinuclear space. Nesprin-3 and-4 may play a role in unloading enormous cargo; Nesprin-3 proteins bind plectin and link the nuclear envelope to cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Nesprin-4 proteins bind the plus end directed motor kinesin-1. The outer nuclear membrane is also involved in development, as it fuses with the inner nuclear membrane to form nuclear pores. =Inner membrane= The inner nuclear membrane encloses the nucleoplasm, and is covered by the nuclear lamina, a mesh of intermediate filaments which stabilizes the nuclear membrane as well as being involved in chromatin function and entire expression. It is connected to the outer membrane by nuclear pores which penetrate the membranes. While the two membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum are linked, proteins embedded in the membranes tend to stay put rather than dispersing across the continuum. It is lined with a fiber network called the nuclear lamina which is 10-40 nm thick and provides strength. Mutations in the inner nuclear membrane proteins can cause several nuclear envelopathies. =Nuclear pores= Nuclear pores crossing the nuclear envelope The nuclear envelope is punctured by thousands of nuclear pores, large hollow protein complexes about 100 nm across, with an inner channel about 40 nm wide. They link the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Cell division During the G2 phase of interphase, the nuclear membrane increases its surface area and doubles its number of nuclear pore complexes. In eukaryotes such as yeast which undergo closed mitosis, the nuclear membrane stays intact during cell division. The spindle fibers either form within the membrane, or penetrate it without tearing it apart. In other eukaryotes (animals as well as plants), the nuclear membrane must break down during the prometaphase stage of mitosis to allow the mitotic spindle fibers to access the chromosomes inside. The breakdown and reformation processes are not well understood. =Breakdown= In mammals, the nuclear membrane can break down within minutes, following a set of steps during the early stages of mitosis. First, M-Cdk's phosphorylate nucleoporin polypeptides and they are selectively removed from the nuclear pore complexes. After that, the rest of the nuclear pore complexes break apart simultaneously. Biochemical evidence suggests that the nuclear pore complexes disassemble into stable pieces rather than disintegrating into small polypeptide fragments. M-Cdk's also phosphorylate elements of the nuclear lamina (the framework that supports the envelope) leading to the disassembly of the lamina and hence the envelope membranes into small vesicles. Electron and fluorescence microscopy has given strong evidence that the nuclear membrane is absorbed by the endoplasmic reticulum‚Äînuclear proteins not normally found in the endoplasmic reticulum show up during mitosis. In addition to the breakdown of the nuclear membrane during the prometaphase stage of mitosis, the nuclear membrane also ruptures in migrating mammalian cells during the interphase stage of the cell cycle. This transient rupture is likely caused by nuclear deformation. The rupture is rapidly repaired by a process dependent on \\"endosomal sorting complexes required for transport\\" (ESCRT) made up of cytosolic protein complexes. During nuclear membrane rupture events, DNA double-strand breaks occur. Thus the survival of cells migrating through confined environments appears to depend on efficient nuclear envelope and DNA repair machineries. Aberrant nuclear envelope breakdown has also been observed in laminopathies and in cancer cells leading to mislocalization of cellular proteins, the formation of micronuclei and genomic instability. =Reformation= Exactly how the nuclear membrane reforms during telophase of mitosis is debated. Two theories exist‚Äî *Vesicle fusion ‚Äî where vesicles of nuclear membrane fuse together to rebuild the nuclear membrane *Reshaping of the endoplasmic reticulum‚Äîwhere the parts of the endoplasmic reticulum containing the absorbed nuclear membrane envelop the nuclear space, reforming a closed membrane. Origin of the nuclear membrane A study of the comparative genomics, evolution and origins of the nuclear membrane led to the proposal that the nucleus emerged in the primitive eukaryotic ancestor (the ‚Äúprekaryote‚Äù), and was triggered by the archaeo- bacterial symbiosis. Several ideas have been proposed for the evolutionary origin of the nuclear membrane. These ideas include the invagination of the plasma membrane in a prokaryote ancestor, or the formation of a genuine new membrane system following the establishment of proto-mitochondria in the archaeal host. The adaptive function of the nuclear membrane may have been to serve as a barrier to protect the genome from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the cells' pre-mitochondria.Bernstein H, Bernstein C.

Life Buck was born in 1812, the son and heir of Lewis William Buck (1784‚Äì1858). He inherited the estates of his father in 1858, and in the same year changed his name and assumed by royal licence the name and arms of Stucley in lieu of his patronymic as lineal heir of the ancient Stucley family, which had possessed Affeton Castle in Devon for over 600 years. He thus possessed the paternal Buck estate of Daddon and other lands, the Stucley inheritance of Affeton and other lands and also Hartland Abbey and other lands. In April 1859 he was created a Baronet, of Affeton Castle in the County of Devon. He had a keen interest in family history, heraldry and his ancestors. He redecorated Hartland Abbey and in 1868-9 reconstructed the ruinous Gatehouse at Affeton, the only part of the fortified manor house of the Stucleys which had been left standing since the destruction of the house during the Civil War, which he renamed \\"Affeton Castle\\" and used as a shooting lodge for the grouse shooting season on Affeton Moor. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, and obtained a commission in the Royal Horse Guards, from which he retired with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was afterwards connected to the Devon Artillery Militia, of which he was appointed in command in 1849 and retired with the honorary rank of colonel as the regiment was disbanded in 1853. As George Buck he unsuccessfully ran for Parliament for the Exeter constituency in 1852, but was elected for Barnstaple in 1855, a seat he held until 1857 and again as George Stucley between 1865 and 1868. In 1863 he served as High Sheriff of Devon, and he was also a Deputy Lieutenant for Devon and Cornwall. For many years he was chairman of the Bideford Board of Guardians, and on the establishment of district and parish councils was elected by the board as a co-opted member. As patron he made two presentations to the rectory of Bideford, in 1878 (Rev. Roger Granville (died 1896), author of History of the Granville Family (lords of the manor of Bideford for many centuries)) and in 1896. He was known as a keen sportsman and was an active man until a few years before his death. Stucley died at his residence Moreton House, Bideford, on 13 March 1900, aged 87. Family Stucley married first in 1835 Lady Elizabeth O'Bryan, 4th daughter and co- heiress of William O'Brien, 2nd Marquess of Thomond (1765‚Äì1846), by whom he had children. Lady Elizabeth Stucley died in 1870. He married secondly in 1872 to Louisa Granville, daughter of Sir Beville Granville of Wellesbourne, Warwickshire. Lady Stucley died in 1913. He lived at Hartland Abbey from 1840 to 1870, when following the death of his first wife he handed ownership of Hartland Abbey to his son Lewis.

The band was co-founded by Johnnie Dee, keyboardist and vocalist Brad Bent, and drummer Mike Lengyell in 1981. Biography Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, Grehan began playing piano and switched to guitar at age 11. His early influences included Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix and Santana. Grehan recorded his first single at 17, with a band known as Stytch. Grehan attended Fanshawe College in London, Ontario, and received a diploma in Recorded Music Production. During this time he wrote \\"New Girl Now\\" which would later become one of Honeymoon Suite's biggest hits. After moving to Toronto he hooked up with singer Johnnie Dee in 1982 and together they recruited the other members to form Honeymoon Suite. Their subsequent demo recording of \\"New Girl Now\\" was entered into a contest sponsored by radio station Q107 and they won first prize. This exposure led to a record deal with Warner Music and the band released their first self-titled album in 1984. Honeymoon Suite (named after the band members' hometown of Niagara Falls, Ontario) sold over 300,000 copies of their debut in Canada and toured North America and Europe extensively. They were the opening act for many touring acts including Heart, ZZ Top and Journey. The band released two more albums during the 1980s (The Big Prize and Racing After Midnight) and received much exposure when their songs were featured in the hit TV show Miami Vice. Grehan even played the lead role in a 1986 Pepsi commercial, air- guitaring a solo originally done by Vinnie Moore. Honeymoon suite released three more albums in the 1990s and continued to tour.

History  The Portuguese name, meaning 'dog from Castro Laboreiro', refers to a small town in the far north of Portugal, now a parish in the Melga√ßo urban area. It is in the same mountains as the Peneda-Ger√™s National Park. Although now served by modern highways, the mountainous, rocky area was once quite remote. The modern breed is descended from a very old molosser type, which worked with livestock herders in the mountains, defending against wolves and other large predators. The origin of the breed is not known, although many legends are given. The Portuguese breed club notes that \\"Everything that is written about their origins is pure fiction, without any scientific or historical accuracy ... data is rare, or does not exist ... most guardian and herding breeds do not have records before 1900\\". There are mentions of the Castro Laboreiro in the 19th century but none before 1800. Camilo Castelo Branco in his novella A Brasileira de Prazins (1882) mentions \\"the dogs of Castro Laboreiro, very fierce ...\\" The modern breed today is of the general type of livestock guardian dog that moved with the pastoralist nomads of the transhumance into many areas of the world, possibly arriving before 3000 BCE in the Iberian Peninsula. It is generally theorised that the origin was in Mesopotamia where modern sheep and goats were domesticated. Modern genetic studies have shown that the modern breed is unique from other similar breeds in Portugal. Original paper:MtDNA diversity among four Portuguese autochthonous dog breeds: a fine-scale characterisation BMC Genet. 2005; 6: 37. Published online 2005 June 22. . It is said to be \\"ferocious against wolves.\\" With the eradication of wolves and other large predators the Castro Laboreiro Dog lost its original use. Changes in agricultural methods over the last hundred years led to many of these dogs being abandoned, turning feral and becoming a problem for those that raise cattle and horses. Today, the breed has mostly been removed from its native range and purpose, and is kept as a companion and guard dog. It was first exhibited at a dog show in 1914, and the first written breed standard was by veterinarian Manuel Marques in 1935, when the breed was recognised by the Clube Portugues de Canicultura, the official F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) kennel club for Portugal founded in 1897.Clube Portugues de Canicultura (in Portuguese) The Castro Laboreiro Dog is recognised by the FCI in Group 2, Section 2.2: Mastiffs, Mountain Type, Portugal (breed number 150). It is also recognised, under its Portuguese name, by the United Kennel Club in the United States, in their Guardian dog group. It may also be listed under the name , similar-sounding names, or different English versions of the name (such as Portuguese cattle dog or Portuguese watchdog) by large commercial breeders, minor kennel clubs that require little to no breed verification for registration, and Internet-based dog registry businesses, where it is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a fashionably novel or unique pet. Nevertheless, the number of specimens of this breed does not exceed 500 in the whole world. In Portugal, there are a half-dozen breeders, plus a couple more elsewhere in Europe (in United Kingdom and Germany), and one in the US.  Appearance  The standardised appearance for which the Castro Laboreiro Dog has been bred is somewhat wolf-like in outline. It is a large dog, but not oversize. Height should not be above 60 cm (24 in) at the withers and weight should not be more than 40 kg (88 lbs); females somewhat smaller. Coat colours are ofte described in wolf terms: \\"dark wolf colour\\", \\"light wolf colour\\". Most breeders prefer what is considered the most authentic, called \\"mountain colour\\" (), also described as similar to the coat of a wolf, but a mixed light and dark grey interspersed with individual hairs (not spots) that are brown (called \\"pine-seed\\") or dark red (called \\"mahogany\\"), forming overall a brindle pattern.  Health issues  Health issues specific to the breed have not been documented. Dogs represented as Castro Laboreiros may be mixed with other breeds, which may have other genetic health problems. Puppy buyers should enquire of breeders about types of health testing done on the sire and dam; responsible breeders will be able to provide information. Being a \\"rare breed\\" does not guarantee immunity from inherited disease or disability.

It was built in 1827-1828, to a design by architect William Henry Playfair (1789‚Äì1857). The first minister of the church was William Muir, who opened an evening school in the large vaulted cellars of the church for the education of the illiterate. The interior was altered in 1956, the congregation having declined. A major fundraising effort was organised led by the then minister, the Revd A. Ian Dunlop. This was one of the first subdivisions of major buildings in Edinburgh, with the reconstructed church occupying effectively the gallery level accessed by the main staircase from Howe Street, and a number of halls (including a main hall with fully fitted stage etc.) and meeting rooms formed below. These halls have over the years hosted a number of events including Festival Fringe shows. During the reconstruction the church fittings by architect David Rhind (1808‚Äì1883) were kept, as was the organ by Willis, which was re-built on the \\"gallery\\" level. On 27 June 2014, Leslie Benzies, a video game producer and at the time president of Rockstar North, announced a deal to purchase the church for over 500 thousand pounds. He plans to preserve the building and create a trust composed of members of the community to manage it. However, in 2017, Philip Johnston, trustee for the Benzies Foundation announced, \\"We now believe we have taken this as far as we can\\". On 12 July 2017, Peter Schaufuss, founder of the English National Ballet School purchased the church from the Benzies Foundation, stating \\"I plan to make the Great Hall a world-class theatre, one that will attract productions from leading companies from around the world\\". Ground and basement areas, meanwhile, would be intended to find mixed commercial, cultural and community usage.

Retrieved 22 February 2014. According to Eurostat, OECD and others, Internet access in Poland is among the most expensive in Europe. This is mostly caused by the lack of competitiveness and lack of know-how. New operators like Dialog and GTS Energis are making their own provider lines and offer more attractive and cheaper service. In February 2011, the Polish Office of Electronic Communication issued an order forcing the TPSA to rent 51% of their ADSL lines to other ISPs at 60% discount of their market pricing. As the result the prices are non-competitive, other ISP charge as TPSA making a guaranteed 40% profit, while TPSA has no incentive to lower its consumer prices, because it would result in lowering of wholesale prices as well. ADSL The most popular ADSL services for home users in Poland are Neostrada provided by TPSA and Net24 provided by Netia. Both provide download speeds in the range of 10 to 80 Mbit/s and upload speeds of 1 Mbit/s or more.

Internet censorship and surveillance The government does slightly restrict access to the Internet by using a black registry of internet sites, the PiS party deems un lawful, but there are no credible reports that it monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.

In January 2012, thousands protested Prime Minister Tusk's signing of the Anti- Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) establishing international standards for enforcing intellectual property rights, accusing it of facilitating Internet censorship.

The first available connections were dial-up. Cable Internet has been available since 1998 and ADSL since 2001. Currently T√ºrk Telekom's TTNET ADSL2+ service is the most widely used Internet service in Turkey, offering speeds from 8 Mbit/s to 24 Mbit/s. TTNET offers VDSL2 service with speeds at 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s as well.http://www.ttnet.com.tr/web/234-1196-1-1/tur/evde_ttnet/baglanti_cesitleri_- _vdsl2/kisaca Alternative broadband companies, while mostly still using TTNET infrastructure, such as SmileADSL and Biri are also available. Superonline is offering fibre broadband in limited areas in 12 cities, though the company is enlarging at a healthy pace. They currently offer up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds. Furthermore, relatively wide but not universal coverage of cable Internet is maintained by UyduNET, offering speeds from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. In March 2012, TTNet and Superonline, which between themselves provide the bulk of Turkish broadband Internet access, have started applying \\"fair use\\" policies (known with the Turkish abbreviations AKK for \\"Adil Kullanƒ±m Kotasƒ±\\" and AKN for \\"Adil Kullanƒ±m Noktasƒ±\\") that are overly restrictive in terms of the allowed download and upload quotas. Most accounts are allotted 50 GB download (and 10 GB upload) quotas, after which the bandwidth is reduced 10-fold, down to 3 Mbit/s. Some users have reported that their broadband speeds were reduced in six days into the month. Both companies have been under heavy criticism for their \\"fair use\\" policies. TTNET's monopoly and perceived excessive pricing have received numerous criticisms from users over the years. According to T√úSƒ∞AD, Turkey has 36 million active Internet users with 10 million active e-commerce users. The penetration and the usage of credit cards are very high in Turkey. However development of alternative payment systems will be helpful both by facilitating the shopping of the consumers owning credit cards and by familiarizing non-credit card holders with the e-commerce. In 2019 it was reported that the Internet users of Turkey had reached to 69,107,183 (12th highest number of internet users worldwide)  amounting to 88% of Turkish households having internet access. Turkey implements protectionist policies to stimulate the local internet technology industry and enforce data retention: In 2016 payment gateway PayPal was forced to cease most of its operations in the country. In January 2017 the government unveiled plans to build a domestic web search engine and webmail service. Internet Entrepreneurship in Turkey, also called \\"Digital Bosphorus\\" has reached several exits in last years. The biggest three of them have been Yemeksepeti, Gittigidiyor and Markafoni. According to Sina Afra, the potential of the Turkish Internet market is bigger than in many other European countries. Internet in Turkey holds a 'Not Free' ranking in Freedom House's index. Turkish government has constantly blocked websites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and as of May 2017, Wikipedia is currently inaccessible. According to Twitter's transparency report, Turkey leads in social media censorship. Censorship More than 7000 web sites in Turkey are blocked. In Turkey, the Telecommunications Communication Committee (TIB) for the decision of the court is sought by barriers blocked sites.

Ochaya are located in , and are today most numerous in Kyoto, though they can be found in geisha districts in other cities, such as Tokyo. Ochaya, where geisha entertain, should be distinguished from okiya (boarding house), where geisha live ‚Äì these may both be loosely translated as \\"geisha house.\\" Geisha are attached to a single boarding house (where they do not entertain), and entertain at various ochaya or other venues from night to night. This arrangement originally developed in the y≈´kaku, or pleasure quarters, where oiran below the rank of tay≈´ or k≈çshi could be summoned to entertain guests at ochaya.Seigle, Cecilia Segawa, Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan. University of Hawaii Press, 1993. Terminology Though the term \\"ochaya\\" literally means \\"tea house\\", they do not serve tea, except incidentally (that is, as an ordinary beverage); buildings or rooms for Japanese tea ceremony are instead known as . When used as part of a name, the honorific prefix o- is not used in Japanese, and the plain \\"chaya\\" is used as a suffix, as in \\"Ichiriki Chaya\\". In English this is not always observed, and terminology such as \\"Ichiriki Ochaya\\" is sometimes used. Ochaya are often referred to instead simply by their name, as in \\"(the) Ichiriki\\". Access left Ochaya are typically very exclusive establishments ‚Äì with very rare exceptions, one may only enter if one is already an established patron, or accompanied by a patron, with reservations. Relationships to ochaya can often be traced back generations, and are generally associated with a family or company. Switching ochaya is not generally possible, and even patronizing ochaya other than the one with which one is associated is considered a very serious breach of manners. In exceptional circumstances, these restrictions are relaxed. For example, for a brief period of only a few nights in 2006, one ochaya in each of the five Kyoto geisha districts offered general access to a small number of tourists who were unaccompanied by patrons, as part of a tourism promotion program, at the request of the Kyoto City Tourist Association.\\"Exclusive Kyoto Teahouses Open Doors to Tourists.\\" Yomiuri Shimbun [Tokyo] 30 Jan. 2006: .

Interiors will typically be tatami rooms, while exteriors may feature sheer walls (for privacy) or . Services The main function of an ochaya is to provide a private space for entertainment by a geisha (including an apprentice maiko). Geishas are not affiliated with a particular house, but are instead hired from a geisha house (okiya) to provide entertainment, consisting of conversation, flirtation, pouring drinks, traditional games, singing, musical instruments, and dancing.

The telecommunications infrastructure in the United Kingdom provides Internet access to businesses and home users in various forms, including cable, DSL, wireless and mobile. The share of households with internet access in the United Kingdom grew from 9 percent in 1998 to 93 percent in 2019. Virtually all adults aged 16 to 44 years in the UK were recent internet users (99%) in 2019, compared with 47% of adults aged 75 years and over; in aggregate, the third-highest in Europe. Online shoppers in the UK spend more per household than consumers in any other country. Internet bandwidth per Internet user was the 7th highest in the world in 2016, and average and peak internet connection speeds were top-quartile in 2017. The Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United Kingdom is .uk and is run by Nominet.  History  The UK has been involved in research and development of packet switching, computer networks, and communication protocols since their origins. The development of these technologies was international from the beginning, although much of the research and development that led to the Internet was driven and funded by the United States.; = Early years = Pioneering research and development of computers in Britain in the 1940s led to partnerships between the public and private sectors that brought about transfer and sharing of personnel and concepts between industry and academia or national research bodies. At the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Alan Turing worked on computer design, assisted by Donald Davies in 1947. Christopher Strachey, who became Oxford University's first professor of computation, filed a patent application for time-sharing in 1959. He passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at a UNESCO-sponsored conference on Information Processing in Paris that year.  Packet switching  After meeting with Licklider in 1965, Donald Davies conceived the idea of packet switching for data communications. He proposed a commercial national data network and developed plans to implement the concept in a local area network, the NPL network, which operated from 1969 to 1986. He and his team, including Derek Barber and Roger Scantlebury, carried out work to analyse and simulate the performance of packet switching networks, including datagram networks. Their research and practice was adopted by the ARPANET in the United States, the forerunner of the Internet, and influenced other researchers in the UK and Europe.  TCP/IP and the early Internet  Along with researchers from the United States and France, Donald Davies, Roger Scantlebury and Derek Barber joined the International Networking Working Group (INWG) in 1972. Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf acknowledged Davies and Scantlebury in their 1974 paper \\"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\\". Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London was one of the first international connections on the ARPANET in 1973, alongside the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) which connected via Sweden's Tanum satellite station. Kirstein co-authored (with Vint Cerf) one of the most significant early technical papers on the internetworking concept in 1978. His research group at UCL adopted TCP/IP in 1982, a year ahead of ARPANET, and played a significant role in the very earliest experimental Internet work. Kirstein's group included Sylvia Wilbur who programmed the computer used as the local node for the network. The Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) was involved in early research and testing of TCP/IP. The first email sent by a head of state was sent from the RSRE over the ARPANET by Queen Elizabeth II in 1976. RSRE was allocated class A Internet address range 25 in 1979, which later became the Ministry of Defence address space, providing 16.7 million IPv4 addresses. When Jon Postel and Paul Mockapetris were designing the Domain Name System in 1984, British researchers expressed a desire to use a country designator. Following the convention used in the UK academic network Name Registration Scheme, the .uk Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) was registered in July 1985, seven months after the original generic top-level domains such as .com and the first country code after .us. At the time, ccTLDs were delegated by Postel to a \\"responsible person\\" and Andrew McDowell at UCL managed .uk, the first country code delegation. He later passed it to Dr Willie Black at the UK Education and Research Networking Association (UK ERNA, which became JANET). JANET connected with NSFNET in 1989. Black managed the ‚ÄúNaming Committee‚Äù until he and John Carey formed Nominet UK in 1996. As one of the first professional ccTLD operators, it became the model for many other operators worldwide. Ivan Pope's company, NetNames, developed the concept of a standalone commercial domain name registrar, which would sell domain registration and other associated services to the public. Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), the domain name registry for the com, net, and org top-level domains (TLDs), assimilated this model, which ultimately led to the separation of registry and registrar functions. Jon Crowcroft and Mark Handley received multiple awards for their work on Internet technology in the 1990s and 2000s. Karen Banks pioneered the use of the Internet to empower women around the world.  Other protocols and networks  During the 1970s, the NPL team researched internetworking and worked on the European Informatics Network, a datagram network linking Euratom, the French research centre INRIA and the UK‚Äôs National Physical Laboratory. The transport protocol of the EIN was the basis of the one adopted by the International Networking Working Group. A number of local and research networks in the early 1970s serving the Science Research Council community became SRCnet, later called SERCnet. British along with French and Canadian research contributed to the development of the X.25 standard by the CCIT in 1976. Logica, together with the French company SESA, set up a joint venture in 1975 to undertake the Euronet development, using X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It established a network linking a number of European countries before being handed over to national PTTs In 1984. Based on the Coloured Book protocols defined by the UK academic community in 1975, Post Office Telecommunications developed an experimental public packet switching network, EPSS. This was the first public data network in the UK when it began operating in 1977. The Coloured Book protocols gained some acceptance internationally as the first complete X.25 standard, and gave the UK \\"several years lead over other countries\\". EPSS was replaced with the Packet Switch Stream using X.25 in 1980. PSS connected to an International Packet Switched Service (IPSS), created in 1978 in a collaboration between Post Office Telecommunications and two US telecoms companies. Four companies provided electronic mail services in Britain in 1985, enabling subscribers to send email over telephone connections or data networks such as Packet Switch Stream. In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started among British academic networks based on X.25 and the Coloured Book protocols. Known as the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association (UK ERNA), and later JNT Association, this became JANET in 1984, the UK's high-speed academic and research network that linked all universities, higher education establishments, and publicly funded research laboratories. The National Computing Centre publication 'Why Distributed Computing' which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems, resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977. This international effort ultimately led to the OSI model as an international reference model, published in 1984. For a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, engineers, organizations and nations became polarized over the issue of which standard, the OSI model or the Internet protocol suite would result in the best and most robust computer networks. Commercial networking services between the UK and the US were being developed in late 1990. In 1991, JANET adopted Internet Protocol on the existing network. In the same year, Dai Davies introduced Internet technology into the pan-European NREN, EuropaNet, which was built on the X.25 protocol. = World Wide Web = In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN in Switzerland, wrote a proposal for \\"a large hypertext database with typed links\\". The following year, he specified HTML, the hypertext language, and HTTP, the protocol. These concepts became a world-wide information system known as the World Wide Web (WWW). Operating on the Internet, it allows documents to be created for reading or accessing services with connections to other documents or services, accessed by clicking on hypertext links, enabling the user to navigate from one document or service to another. Nicola Pellow worked with Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau on the WWW project at CERN. BT (British Telecommunications plc) began using the WWW in 1991 during a collaborative project called the Oracle Alliance Program. It was founded in 1990 by Oracle Corporation, based in California, to provide information for its corporate partners and about those partners. BT became involved in May 1991. File sharing was required as part of the program and, initially, floppy disks were sent through the post. Then in July 1991 access to the Internet was implemented by BT network engineers using the BT packet switching network. A link was established from Ipswich to London for access to the Internet backbone. The first file transfers made via a NeXT-based WWW interface were completed in October 1991.BT network engineer Clive Salmon established access to the Internet for the project leader, Richard Moulding of BT, in July 1991. The BBC registered with the DDN-NIC in 1989, establishing Internet access via Brunel University. In 1991, bbc.co.uk was registered through JANET NRS and the BBC's first website went online in 1994. The Web brought many social and commercial uses to the Internet which was previously a network for academic institutions. It began to enter everyday use in 1994. An early attempt to provide access to the Web on television was being developed in 1995. = Dial-up = Pipex was established in 1990 and began providing dial-up Internet access in March 1992, the UK's first commercial Internet provider. By November 1993 Pipex provided Internet service to 150 customer sites. One of its first customers was Demon Internet which popularised dial up modem-based internet access in the UK. Other commercial Internet service providers, and web-hosting companies aimed at small businesses and individuals, developed in the 1990s. By May 1998 Demon Internet had 180,000 subscribers. This narrowband service has been almost entirely replaced by the new broadband technologies, and is now generally only used as a backup. BT trialled its first ISDN 'broadband' connection in 1992. The first commercial service was available from Telewest in 2000.  Broadband  Broadband allowed the signal in one line to be split between telephone and Internet data, meaning users could be online and make phone calls at the same time. It also enabled faster connections, making it easier to browse the Internet and download files. Broadband Internet access in the UK was, initially, provided by a number of regional cable television and telephone companies which gradually merged into larger groups. The development of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology has allowed broadband to be delivered via traditional copper telephone cables. Also, Wireless Broadband is now available in some areas. These three technologies (cable, DSL and wireless) now compete with each other.http://www.newstatesman.com/considerthis/supplements/broadbandsupp.pdf More than half of UK homes had broadband in 2007, with an average connection speed of 4.6 Mbit/s. Bundled communications deals mixing broadband, digital TV, mobile phone and landline phone access were adopted by forty per cent of UK households in the same year, up by a third over the previous year. This high level of service is considered the main driver for the recent growth in online advertising and retail. In 2006 the UK market was dominated by six companies, with the top two taking 51%, these being Virgin Media with a 28% share, and BT at 23%. As of July 2011 BT's share had grown by six percent and the company became the broadband market leader. The UK broadband market is overseen by the government watchdog Ofcom. According to Ofcom's 2007 report the average UK citizen uses the Internet for 36 minutes every day. The Ofcom Communications Market 2018 report provided updated UK broadband usage statistics. A standout statistic from the 2012 Ofcom report compared with the 2018 Ofcom report is that the 2012 report showed just 5% of adults had access and use of a Smart TV, this increased to 42% by 2018 exemplifying the extra bandwidth required by broadband providers on their networks. = Cable = Cable broadband uses coaxial cables or optical fibre cables. The main cable service provider in the UK is Virgin Media and the current maximum speed available to their customers is 1Gb/sec (subject to change). = Digital subscriber line (DSL) = Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) was introduced to the UK in trial stages in 1998 and a commercial product was launched in 2000. In the United Kingdom, most exchanges, local loops and backhauls are owned and managed by BT Wholesale, who then wholesale connectivity via Internet service providers, who generally provide the connectivity to the Internet, support, billing and value added services (such as web hosting and email). As of October 2012, BT operate 5630 exchanges across the UK with the vast majority being enabled for ADSL. Only a relative handful have not been upgraded to support ADSL products ‚Äì in fact it is under 100 of the smallest and most rural exchanges. Some exchanges, numbering under 1000, have been upgraded to support SDSL products. However, these exchanges are often the larger exchanges based in major towns and cities so they still cover a large proportion of the population. SDSL products are aimed more at business customers and are priced higher than ADSL services.  Unbundled local loop  Many companies are now operating their own services using local loop unbundling. Initially Bulldog Communications in the London area and Easynet (through their sister consumer provider UK Online) enabled exchanges across the country from London to Central Scotland. In November 2010, having purchased Easynet in the preceding months, Sky closed the business-centric UK Online with little more than a month's notice. Although Easynet continued to offer business-grade broadband connectivity products, UKO customers could not migrate to an equivalent Easynet service, only being offered either a MAC to migrate provider or the option of becoming a customer of the residential-only Sky Broadband ISP with an introductory discounted period. Also, some previously available service features like fastpath (useful for time-critical protocols like SIP) were not made available on Sky Broadband, leaving business users with a difficult choice particularly where UK Online were the only LLU provider. Since then, Sky Broadband has become a significant player in the quad play telecoms market, offering ADSL line rental and call packages to customers (who have to pay a supplement if they are not also Sky television subscribers). Whilst Virgin Media is the nearest direct competitor, their quad play product is available to fewer homes given the fixed nature of their cable infrastructure. TalkTalk is the next DSL-based ISP with a mature quad play product portfolio (EE's being the merger of the Orange and T-Mobile service providers, and focusing their promotion on forthcoming fibre broadband and 4G LTE products). Market consolidation and expansion has permitted service providers to offer faster and less expensives services with typical speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s downstream (subject to ISP and line length). They can offer products at sometimes considerably lower prices, due to not necessarily having to conform to the same regulatory requirements as BT Wholesale: for example, 8 unbundled LLU pairs can deliver 10 Mbit/s over 3775 m for half the price of a similar fibre connection.LLU VS Fibre. Infographic, MLL Telecom 2011 In 2005, another company, Be, started offering speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s downstream and 2.5 Mbit/sec upstream using ADSL2+ with Annex M, eventually from over 1,250 UK exchanges. Be were taken over by O2's parent company Telef√≥nica in 2007. On 1 March 2013 O2 Telef√≥nica sold Be to Sky who have now migrated O2 and Be customers onto the somewhat slower Sky network. Exchanges continue to be upgraded, subject to demand, across the country, although at a somewhat slower pace since BT's commencement of FTTC rollout plans and near-saturation in key geographical areas.  IPstream  Up until the launch of \\"Max\\" services, the only ADSL packages available via BT Wholesale were known as IPstream Home 250, Home 500, Home 1000 and Home 2000 (contention ratio of 50:1); and Office 500, Office 1000, and Office 2000 (contention ratio of 20:1). The number in the product name indicates the downstream data rate in kilobits per second. The upstream data rate is up to 250 kbit/s for all products.1 kbit = 1000 bit For BT Wholesale ADSL products, users initially had to live within 3.5 kilometres of the local telephone exchange to receive ADSL, but this limit was increased thanks to rate-adaptive digital subscriber line (RADSL), although users with RADSL possibly had a reduced upstream rate, depending on the quality of their line. There are still areas that cannot receive ADSL because of technical limitations, not least of which networks in housing areas built with aluminium cable rather than copper in the 1980s and 1990s, and areas served by optical fibre (TPON), though these are slowly being serviced with copper. In September 2004, BT Wholesale removed the line-length/loss limits for 500 kbit/s ADSL, instead employing a tactic of \\"suck it and see\\" ‚Äî enabling the line, then seeing if ADSL would work on it. This sometimes includes the installation of a filtered faceplate on the customer's master socket, so as to eliminate poor quality telephone extension cables inside the customer's premises which can be a source of high frequency noise. In the past, the majority of home users used packages with 500 kbit/s (downstream) and 250 kbit/s (upstream) with a 50:1 contention ratio. However, BT Wholesale introduced the option of a new charging structure to ISPs which means that the wholesale service cost was the same regardless of the ADSL data rate, with charges instead being based on the amount of data transferred. Nowadays, most home users use a package whose data rate is only limited by the technical limitations of their telephone line. Initially this was 2 Mbit/s downstream. Until the advent of widespread FTTC, most home products were first ADSL Max- based (up to 7.15 Mbit/s), using ADSL G.992.1 and then later ADSL2+ (up to 21 Mbit/s).  Max and Max Premium  Following successful trials, BT announced the availability of higher speed services known as BT ADSL Max and BT ADSL Max Premium in March 2006. BT made the \\"Max\\" product available to more than 5300 exchanges, serving around 99% of UK households and businesses. Both Max services offered downstream data rates of up to 7.15 Mbit/s. Upstream data rates were up to 400 kbit/s for the standard product and up to 750 kbit/s for the premium product. (Whilst the maximum downstream data rate for IPStream Max is often touted as 8 Mbit/s, this is in fact misleading because, in a departure from previous practice, it actually refers to the gross ATM data rate. The maximum data rate available at the IP level is 7.15 Mbit/s; the maximum TCP payload rate ‚Äì the rate one would actually see for file transfer ‚Äì would be about 7.0 Mbit/s.) The actual downstream data rate achieved on any given Max line is subject to the capabilities of the line. Depending on the stable ADSL synchronisation rate negotiated, BT's ‚Äò20CN‚Äô system applied a fixed rate limit from one of the following data rates: 160 kbit/s, 250, 500, 750 kbit/s, 1.0 Mbit/s, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0 Mbit/s, then in 500 kbit/s steps up to 7.0 Mbit/s, then a final maximum rate of 7.15 Mbit/s.  Speeds  On 13 August 2004 the ISP Wanadoo (formerly Freeserve and now EE in the UK) was told by the Advertising Standards Authority to change the way that they advertised their 512 kbit/s broadband service in Britain, removing the words \\"full speed\\" which rival companies claimed was misleading people into thinking it was the fastest available service. In a similar way, on 9 April 2003 the Advertising Standards Authority ruled against ISP NTL, saying that NTL's 128 kbit/s cable modem service must not be marketed as \\"broadband\\". Ofcom reported in June 2005 that there were more broadband than dial-up connections for the first time in history. In the third quarter of 2005 with the merger of NTL and Telewest, a new alliance was formed to create the largest market share of broadband users. This alliance brought about huge increases in bandwidth allocations for cable customers (minimum speed increasing from the industry norm of 512 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s home lines with both companies planning to have all domestic customers upgraded to at least 4 Mbit/s downstream and ranging up to 10 Mbit/s and beyond by mid-2006.) along with the supply of integrated services such as Digital TV and Phone packages. March 2006 saw the nationwide launch of BT Wholesale's up to ‚Äú8 Mbit/s‚Äù ADSL services, known as ADSL Max. ‚ÄúMax‚Äù-based packages are available to end users on any broadband-enabled BT exchange in the UK. Since 2003, BT has been introducing SDSL to exchanges in many of the major cities. Services are currently offered at upload/download speeds of 256 kbit/s, 512 kbit/s, 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s. Unlike ADSL, which is typically 256 kbit/s upload, SDSL upload speeds are the same as the download speed. BT usually provide a new copper pair for SDSL installs, which can be used only for the SDSL connection. At a few hundred pounds a quarter, SDSL is significantly more expensive than ADSL, but is significantly cheaper than a leased line. SDSL is marketed to businesses and offers low contention ratios, and in some cases, a service level agreement. At present, the BT Wholesale SDSL enablement programme has stalled, most probably due to a lack of uptake. Still in the year 2015 it was common in highly developed areas like the London Aldgate region for consumers to be limited to speeds of up to 8 Mbit/s for ADSL services. This had a major effect in the London rental market as limited broadband service can affect the readiness of prospective tenants to sign a rental lease. In March 2020, the UK government set the Universal Service Obligation to 10 Mbit/s download and 1 Mbit/s upload. As of the 2nd May 2020, 96.9% of UK households can receive \\"superfast broadband\\" which is defined as 30 Mbit/s and 19.29% of UK households can receive gigabit speeds, either via FTTP or DOCSIS 3.1. While 1.07% of UK households currently have broadband that's slower than the legal USO. In September 2020, the UK dropped 13 places in the 2020 Worldwide Broadband Speed League and is now among the slowest in Europe with a mean download speed of 37.82Mbps. Cable.co.uk blames this low speed on Openreach who have set entry level FTTC packages to 30 - 35Mbps and 'fast' FTTC to 60 - 70Mbps for more than five years with no significant changes. The UK was somewhat late to deploying full fibre (FTTP/FTTH) due to their reliance on FTTC/VDSL technologies. The deployment of FTTC/VDSL technologies was largely driven by the lack of political appetite and funding for FTTP at the time.  Developments since 2006  Since 2006, the UK market has changed significantly; companies that previously provided telephone and television subscriptions also began to offer broadband. TalkTalk offered customers ‚Äòfree‚Äô broadband if they had a telephone package. Orange responded by offering ‚Äòfree‚Äô broadband for some mobile customers. Many smaller ISPs now offer similar packages. O2 also entered the broadband market by taking over LLU provider Be, while Sky (BSkyB) had already taken over LLU broadband provider Easynet. In July 2006, Sky announced 2 Mbit/s broadband to be available free to Sky TV customers and a higher speed connection at a lower price than most rivals. In 2007 BT announced service trials for ADSL2+. Entanet, BT Wholesale and BT Retail were chosen as the three service providers for the first service trial in the West Midlands In 2011, BT began offering 100 Mbit/s FTTP broadband in Milton Keynes. The service in 2014 operates to speeds in excess of 300 Mbit/s. Virgin Media stated that 13 million UK homes are covered by their optical fibre broadband network, and that by the end of 2012 would be able to offer 100 Mbit/s broadband. There are currently over 100 towns in the UK that have access to this service. In October 2011, British operator Hyperoptic launched a 1 Gbit/s FTTH service in London. In October 2012, British operator Gigler UK launched a 1 Gbit/s down and 500Mbit/sec up FTTH service in Bournemouth using the CityFibre network.http://www.thinkbroadband.com/news/5480-gigler-launches-gigabit-fibre- service-in-bournemouth.html In 2015, BT unveiled universal 5-10 mbit/s broadband and the rollout of 500 Mbit/s G.Fast. The aim was to push \\"ultra- fast speeds\\" of 300-500 Mbit/s to 10 million homes using the existing landline cables. The roll-out of G.Fast was paused in 2019 due to Openreach focusing on FTTP. BT has also proposed that they wish to switch off their copper network by 2027. In 2015, BT began the roll out of G.INP on their FTTC network, the use of G.INP is to help improve line stability and reduce overheads and latency. The roll-out was paused on ECI broadband cabinet equipment due to the lack of support for upstream re-transmission which caused network slowdowns and higher latency. The rollout of G.INP on Huawei broadband cabinets was completed in 2015 while G.INP on ECI equipment has reentered the trial stage as of May 2020. In September 2016, Sky \\"completed\\" their roll-out of IPv6 with 95% of their customers getting IPv6 access. BT rolled out IPv6 support for \\"all BT Broadband lines\\" two months later in November 2016. During the 2019 General Election, Boris Johnson pledged full fibre for all of the UK by 2025. This was later rolled back to \\"gigabit-capable\\" broadband. This means that mixed technologies are allowed, for example Virgin Media can continue to use their cable infrastructure since the DOCSIS 3.1 is \\"gigabit-capable\\" and other ISPs can also sell 5G broadband. In January 2020, Openreach announced that they will deploy FTTP technology in 200 rural locations by March 2021. In March 2020, the UK government set the Universal Service Obligation to 10 Mbit/s Download and 1 Mbit/s Upload. In late April 2020, UK Rural ISP B4RN launched their 10 Gbit/s symmetrical home broadband. Openreach reported that on 29 April 2020 they saw a record peak of 10 petabytes of data going through their network. This increase of internet traffic is the result of the lock- down in the UK caused by COVID-19. In May 2020, Openreach announced that their FTTP network has covered 2.5 million UK premises. As of 2 May 2020, 96.9% of UK households can receive \\"superfast broadband\\" which is defined as 30 Mbit/s and 19.29% of UK households can receive gigabit speeds, either via FTTP or DOCSIS 3.1. While 1.07% of UK households currently have broadband that's slower than the legal USO. The UK has a 31.15% IPv6 adoption rate as of early May 2020. In July 2020, availability of full fibre (FTTP) Internet in the UK reached 15%. = Wireless broadband = The term \\"wireless broadband\\" generally refers to the provision of a wireless router with a broadband connection, although it can also refer to alternative wireless methods of broadband delivery, such as satellite or radio-based technology. These alternative delivery models are often deployed in areas that are physically or commercially unfeasible to reach by traditional fixed methods. = Mobile broadband = Mobile broadband is high-speed Internet access provided by mobile phone operators using a device that requires a SIM card to access the service (such as the Huawei E220). A new mobile broadband technology emerging in the United Kingdom is 4G which hopes to replace the old 3G technology currently in use and could see download speeds increased to 300Mbit/s. The company EE have been the first company to start developing a full scale 4G network throughout the United Kingdom. This was later followed by other telecommunications companies in the UK such as O2 (Telef√≥nica) and Vodafone.  Children's access to the Internet  Educational computer networks are maintained by organisations such as JANET and East Midlands Public Services Network. According to a 2017 Ofcom report named 'Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report' more younger children are going online than in 2016 with much of the growth coming from increased use of tablets. A survey on UK school children's access to the Internet commissioned by security company Westcoastcloud in 2011 found half have no parental controls installed on their internet connected devices and half of parents said they have concerns about the lack of controls installed on their children's Internet devices.\\"UK Filtering Software Company Releases Survey on Kids' Internet Access\\", Quichen Zhang, OpenNet Initiative, 26 September 2011\\"10% of UK elementary schoolkids own an iPhone; 5% own an iPad\\" , Brad Reed, Network World, 23 September 2011\\"Westcoastcloud survey reveals 1 in 10 UK primary school children have iPhones\\" , Westcoastcloud, accessed 3 October 2011  Call for better oversight  In June 2018 Tom Winsor, Her Majesty‚Äôs chief inspector of constabulary, said technologies like encryption should be breakable if law enforcers have a warrant. Winsor said the public was running out of patience with organisations like Facebook, Telegram (software) and WhatsApp. Winsor said, ‚ÄúThere is a handful of very large companies with a highly dominant influence over how the internet is used. In too many respects, their record is poor and their reputation tarnished. The steps they take to make sure their services cannot be abused by terrorists, paedophiles and organised criminals are inadequate; the commitment they show and their willingness to be held to account are questionable.‚Äù\\"Growing case for forcing internet firms to cooperate, says police watchdog\\", Vikram Dodd, 12 June 2018,The Guardian.

Early life Krekel was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1950. He became interested in music early and his first lessons were on the drums. He began taking guitar lessons at age 10 or 11, when it dawned on him that \\"the guitar player was up front getting all the attention, [like] Rick Nelson\\". He was singing and playing his guitar for audiences by the time he was 12, gigging in Lebanon, Kentucky, at places like The Golden Horseshoe and Club 68. He began to write his own songs in high school, although he was reluctant to share them with anyone for a few years. Krekel's first band was an eight-piece basement band called The Octaves. He continued to sharpen his skills and, by the late 1960s, he was in a popular Louisville band called Dusty. It was around this time that two of Tim's peers, Steve Ferguson and Terry Adams, went off and started NRBQ, returning to Louisville with a record contract. For the first time, Tim thought seriously about music as a profession and realized what he had to do. He and Dusty moved to New York City, where they played gigs for a few months while Tim got more serious about writing. After about six months, Tim decided he would be happier pursuing his career closer to home and moved back to Louisville. Still using the name Dusty, he started another band which developed a strong local following. \\"We played almost every Sunday night at this place called the Storefront Congregation. There was always someone really good sittin' in with us, like Sam Bush, who would bring his electric violin and tear the place up.\\" Professional career While in Louisville in the very early seventies, Tim grouped with a band consisting of himself, Tim (on guitar and vocals), John Owen (bass and vocals), and Bobby Jones (drums and vocals). They first played at 118 W. Washington Street behind white soul singer Len Wade (for then, lease-owner, Eddie Donaldson). When Wade left the gig 3 months into a 6-month contract, Tim, John and Bobby carried on with Bobby singing lead and Tim and John singing harmony.They favored Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, POCO, the Birds and others, some of Tim's originals, and general Pop. Vaughn Meader (from Massachusetts, then living in Louisville and having recorded another album‚Äînot released) also sat in. Local musicians (including Jamie Abersole from South Indiana) also came in periodically and played jazz, as well as Gary Falk, a locally beloved saxophonist and recording studio owner in Louisville. Tim, John, and Bobby then went a block down from 118 W. Washington Street to play at the Red Dog. Here, Steve Ferguson (from NRBQ) sat in periodically with his guitar and sang on occasion during the winter. Tim, even then, was well liked and always hit a common chord with his local Louisville people whenever he played and sang, as witnessed by his band members during this time of his career. Around that time, Krekel made friends in Nashville and was soon playing gigs there. He even did some recording for Jack Clement. It wasn't long before Tim got a road gig with Billy Swan (who had a huge hit with \\"I Can Help\\"). That band toured the States and Europe for a year. Billy went back to playing with Kris Kristofferson, and Tim resumed gigging around Nashville. One night, Tim performed in a showcase where Chet Atkins and a friend were in the audience. The friend turned out to be Jimmy Buffett's manager. He and Chet were quick to recommend Tim to Buffett, who needed a new guitarist. Tim was hired by Buffett and was his lead guitarist for a couple of years in the late 1970s and again in the 1980s. During his first stint with Buffett, Tim played on the Son of a Son of a Sailor album and appeared with him on Saturday Night Live, as well as in the 1978 film FM. They also toured with the Eagles who were enjoying immense popularity at that time. Tim had also assembled his band \\"The Sluggers\\" with John Owen, Guitarist Thomas Goldsmith, keyboardist Jay Spell and Louisvilledrummer Dave Marasco. Tim was offered the opportunity to make his own record and decided to leave Buffett's band to pursue his own musical vision. His first effort,with the Sluggers Crazy Me, was released in 1979; however, the Capricorn label folded a mere three months after the album's debut. It was the first album ever produced by Tony Brown and was a critical success, recorded at Brian Ahern's and Emmylou Harris' house in Coldwater Canyon in L.A., with the Enactron truck in the driveway doing the recording. The Sluggers continued to play bars and colleges, primarily in the Southeast but with some forays up East, until early 1980, when Tim's agent, Don Light, persuaded Tim to leave the band and embark on a solo career. He later assembled another version of the Sluggers, with Tom Comer (stage name Tom Comet) on bass and David Willis Bailey on drums. Tim continued to write, perform and play with other musicians. He recorded his next album for Arista Records with producer Terry Manning; Over The Fence, with The Sluggers, was released in 1986. Rolling Stone called the Sluggers \\"a roots-based guitar band that matters\\". Tim and the Sluggers toured the country for a few years performing with folks like Carl Perkins, the Blasters and Stevie Ray Vaughan. The Italian record company, Appaloosa Records, released his Out Of The Corner in 1991. It received a four-star rating from CD Review, which also touted Tim as \\"One of American Rock 'N Roll's great unknowns.\\" By 1991, Tim had acquired a dedicated following in the U.S. and in Europe. In 1993 Krekel found himself a bit frustrated with the music industry and with some concern over what direction his career should take. Again, he moved back to Louisville. Rejuvenated by his return to familiar surroundings, Tim remembered why he began to make music in the first place. He started a new band, The Groovebillys, and pursued music with a renewed vigor. Tim Krekel & the Groovebillys first release, L&N;, quickly became the best-selling record in Louisville‚Äîoutselling national releases. The band's next release, 1999's Underground, hit number one in local sales its first week. In reviewing the album, The Courier-Journal said \\"Krekel works the roots-rock territory with an authority gained from 25 years in the business\\". In 2002 Happy Town was released across the U.S. on the Envoy/FFE label. Tim along with drummer Mike Alger and bassist Rick Harper recorded the CD over the latter part of 2001, with the assistance of engineer David Barrick (Barrick Recording Studio) and co-producer Ben Ewing (Nashville-based Artists Envoy Agency). The backing tracks were recorded over three days end of August '01 with overdubs recorded a few weeks later. The CD was originally to be by Tim Krekel and The Kasualties, w/ a song titled,Rick Harper \\"We're All Casualties\\" as the lead off track. That version was never finished and remains unreleased. With the events of 9/11, \\"Kasualties\\" was considered inappropriate, and was issued as Tim Krekel. A re-recorded version of the song later appeared on the TKO CD. In May 2005, a horse named Giacomo won the Kentucky Derby and Tim resurrected a song he wrote in the early nineties, named \\"No Mo Do Giacomo\\". The new recording soon took on a life of its own and caught the eye of NBC Sports which filmed Tim and his band and showed highlights of the performance during a pre-Preakness National broadcast. About the same time that Tim's album World Keeps Turnin' was being pressed onto thousands of CDs, millions of racefans were sitting in front of their TVs seeing Tim and the band play \\"No Mo Do Giacomo\\". In 2007, Krekel released Soul Season on the Natchez Trace Label, which featured Michael Webb and the Tim Krekel Orchestra. In March 2009, Tim Krekel was diagnosed with cancer. By mid June 2009, Tim Krekel's health took a drastic turn for the worse and at the final stages of what he described as, \\"A most wonderful life!\\", Krekel was able to die at home under the loving care of his family and hospice on June 24, 2009.

The 1947 Thames flood was the most severe 20th century flood of the River Thames, affecting much of the Thames Valley as well as elsewhere in England during the middle of March 1947 after a severe winter.\\"The great floods of 1947\\", by Martin Wainwright. The Guardian, 25 July 2007.Histories of Windsor ‚Äî The Floods of 1947, by G. G. Cullingham. First published in Windlesora Magazine, 1981. Updated for the 60th anniversary of the flood, March 2007. The worst in over 100 years, it was exacerbated by an extremely high tide. Background The source of the Thames is in Gloucestershire, and it flows east through Oxfordshire. Records have been kept of its water levels since 1893. In January 1947, the country‚Äîparticularly the southeast‚Äîhad been hit by blizzards, which were severe enough to freeze the upper reaches of the River Thames. Winter storms continued into February. Before the flooding, 117 mm (4.6 inches) of precipitation and snow had fallen; the peak flow was 61.7 billion litres of water per day and the damage cost a total of ¬£12 million to repair . The heavy snow had been followed by a period of relatively warm weather, which caused the snow to quickly melt on top of the still-frozen ground, which meant it had nowhere to drain. War damage to some of the locks made matters worse. Maidenhead was particularly badly damaged, with over 2,000 dwellings flooded. Cookham was flooded in 1947. This flood defence wall was constructed in 2002 to defend the town from the river on the left. The same weather conditions caused widespread flooding to many river basins in the country during March 1947.https://forms2.rms.com/rs/729-DJX-565/images/fl_1947_uk_river_floods.pdf Although there were no deaths as a consequence of the flooding, the shock value was sufficient to put flooding on the political agenda. Aftermath Other significant Thames floods since 1947 have occurred in 1968, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2014. Following the 1947 flood, a recent commentator has suggested, the Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead‚Äîhaving been particularly heavily hit‚Äî\\"judged that the zoning regulation after 1947 would cause the area to become derelict and destroy its amenities\\". It is considered a 1/60 year- occurrence event. The flood of 1947 is considered as being instrumental in formulating major government policy developments regarding flood control.

It is endemic to Cuba and several outlying cays. Taxonomy German ornithologist Jean Cabanis described the Cuban black hawk in 1855. It was considered by most authorities to be a subspecies of the Mangrove Black Hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus), although aspects of its behavior were little studied. However, in 2007, the American Ornithologists' Union classified it as a separate species based on differing vocalizations and plumage patterns. It is one of eight species in the New World genus Buteogallus.  Description  The species has an average body length of . The plumage is mainly dark brown verging on black. A lighter greyish or whitish patch may be present on the face between the bill and the eye. White patches at the base of the primary flight feathers are visible in flight. The tail is striped with wide black and white bands. The legs are yellow and the bill is yellow tipped in black. Generally, females tend to be slightly larger in size than males. Common black-hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus gundlachii) juvenile.JPGjuvenile Common black-hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus gundlachii) in flight.JPG Distribution and habitat The Cuban black hawk is endemic to Cuba, where it is found primarily in coastal and mangrove regions and on Isla de la Juventud. It also occurs in wooded areas and even near mountains on the main island, and on several outlying cayes. However, the majority of its sightings are below 800 meters above sea level.  Ecology  The species primarily feeds on crabs and also takes small vertebrates (fish, lizards, rodents and birds). Cuban black hawks breed mainly between March and June, but may do so as early as January. Nests are built in the sub-canopy of mangrove trees and are generally made out of mangrove twigs and lined with foliage. The female hawk lays 1‚Äì2 dark- spotted eggs (42‚Äì56 mm long). The species is monogamous and forms long-term pairs. Conservation The species was first evaluated for the IUCN Red List in 2008 and is listed as Near Threatened. Total population size has been estimated at 15,000 birds. Numbers are suspected to be declining due to the continued degradation and draining of its habitat, which also increases fragmentation of the population.

Career Leworthy started his career with his hometown club Portsmouth. After spending 9 years with Pompey, from the age of 10, he moved to Non-League Fareham Town where his prolific goalscoring record there earned him a dream move to Tottenham Hotspur. Leworthy made his Spurs debut in the North London derby, against arch rivals Arsenal, that ended in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at White Hart Lane in front of a crowd of 40,399 on the 17th April 1985. He played alongside the likes of Glenn Hoddle, Ossie Ardillies, Graham Roberts and Steve Perryman and went on to make a further ten appearances in total, scoring 4 goals. In December 1985, Leworthy moved to fellow First Division side Oxford Utd for a transfer fee of ¬£200,000. He spent 4 years at the club and made 37 appearances, scoring 8 goals - most notably against Manchester United. Following a loan spell at Shrewsbury Town, he then moved to Reading in 1989 where he would spend 3 years. He was loaned to Colchester Utd towards the end of the 1990/1991 season, scoring 4 goals in 9 appearances and helping the U's to a 2nd-place finish in the Vauxhall Conference as runners-up to Barnet. Leworthy returned to the Vauxhall Conference the following season with Farnborough Town, following a permanent switch from Reading ahead of the 1991/1992 season. Leworthy had a couple of very successful seasons at Cherrywood Road and finished the 1992/1993 season as the Vauxhall Conference top goalscorer with 32 League goals (39 in all competitions) despite the club being relegated. He remained in the division following Farnborough's relegation and was sold to newly promoted Dover Athletic in a move that saw the non-league transfer record broken when the Kent club paid ¬£50,000 for his services. Leworthy continued his prolific goalscoring exploits at Crabble and scored 86 times in a total of 158 appearances. He netted all four goals in Dover's 4‚Äì3 win over Woking in February 1996 and, ironically, netted a hat- trick in the very same fixture the following season, just seven months later, which ended in 5‚Äì1 victory for Dover in September 1996. In January 1997 Leworthy moved to fellow Football Conference side Rushden & Diamonds for a fee of ¬£15,000, and his goals in the final 4 months of the season, including a debut goal against his former club Farnborough Town, helped ease the club away from the relegation zone and into a midtable finish.

He also was a member of the Denver Gold in the United States Football League. He played college football at the University of Northern Colorado. Early years Stalls attended Taft High School and did not start playing football until ninth grade, because he used to focus on ice hockey instead. After not receiving much interest and writing letters to 40 prospective schools, he received a scholarship offer from the Division II University of Northern Colorado. He was a four-year starter at defensive tackle and received third-team Little All-American honors in 1975. In 1997, he was inducted into the University of Northern Colorado Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Stalls was selected in the seventh round (191st overall) of the 1977 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. As a rookie he was a core special teams player. In 1978, he was used mainly as a pass-rush specialist at left defensive tackle in place of Jethro Pugh or Larry Cole and emerged as a key reserve, registering 4 unofficial sacks (fourth on the team). In 1979, he started the first 12 games at left defensive tackle (replacing the retired Jethro Pugh) ahead of former first- round draft choice Larry Bethea, until being replaced by Cole, after the Cowboys traded for John Dutton who would play left defensive end. He finished with 51 tackles and 5 unofficial sacks (tied for fourth on the team). In 1980, Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones unretired and the Cowboys opened training camp with 8 quality defensive linemen, when they usually kept seven. The team decided to retain Bethea and Bruce Thornton instead, and on August 6, Stalls was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a 1981 seventh round pick (#173-Ron Fellows) and a 1982 fourth round pick (#101-Brian Carpenter). =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= In 1980, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers traded for Stalls to replace an injured defensive end Wally Chambers. He appeared in 15 games with 3 starts. In 1981, he was a backup end and defensive tackle used mostly on passing downs, until injuries to Lee Roy Selmon and Bill Kollar's season ending knee injury, forced him to start 9 games at left defensive end. In the 1982 strike shortened season, he led the team in sacks (6.5) ahead of the future hall of famer Selmon. The next year, he had a contract holdout during training camp and asked for the Buccaneers to trade him to the Denver Broncos, in order to pursue his veterinarian interests in the offseason. Complicating matters was a tense relationship with head coach John McKay and the team's ownership, because of his NFL players' union activities. Stalls ended up renegotiating his contract after the Broncos didn't accept giving up a fourth- round draft choice as part of the trade. He eventually reported to the team and had to pay $40,000 in fines for missing time. On October 18, he was waived after the Buccaneers were notified that he signed a future services contract with the Denver Gold of the United States Football League. =Los Angeles Raiders (first stint)= On November 10, 1983, needing help on the defensive line, the Los Angeles Raiders signed Stalls to a short-term contract after the Denver Gold agreed to loan him. Although he didn't have the size, he was used as a pass-rushing nose tackle where his quickness created mismatches en route to the Raiders winning Super Bowl XVIII. =Denver Gold (USFL)= Stalls took two weeks off after the Super Bowl to physically recover from the grind of the NFL season and joined training camp in February. In 1984, he led the team in sacks with 12.5 (sixth in the league) but his production started to decline halfway through the season because of his body exhaustion. On May 18, he announced his retirement to concentrate in his next career. =Los Angeles Raiders (second stint)= After sitting out the previous year attending veterinary school at Colorado State University, he was signed by the Los Angeles Raiders as a free agent on July 21, 1985. The team used him again as a pass-rush specialist from the nose tackle position. He was released on October 3. Personal life After football, he experienced many careers such as marine biology at California State University, veterinary medical studies at Colorado State University, investment banking at Boettcher & Company and Stern Brothers, sales at MCI Telecommunications, youth advocacy with the Center for the New West, senior management with the City of Denver's Recreation Department, founder & executive director of The Spot (gang youth center), executive director of Aspen Youth Experience, President/CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Colorado, and currently the founder & executive director of the Street Fraternity in Denver, Colorado.

Overlay: lanthanum/strontium (blue), manganese (purple), oxygen (red). Lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM or LSMO) is an oxide ceramic material with the general formula La1‚àíxSrxMnO3, where x describes the doping level. It has a perovskite-based crystal structure, which has the general form ABO3. In the crystal, the 'A' sites are occupied by lanthanum and strontium atoms, and the 'B' sites are occupied by the smaller manganese atoms. In other words, the material consists of lanthanum manganite with some of the lanthanum atoms substitutionally doped with strontium atoms. The strontium (valence 2+) doping on lanthanum (valence 3+) introduces extra holes in the valence band and thus increases electronic conductivity. Depending on the x value in La1‚àíxSrxMnO3, the unit cell of LSMO can be rhombohedral, cubic, or hexagonal. This change in the unit cell is explained on the basis of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor for perovskites. The change in the oxidation state of the Mn cation in LSMO can be readily observed through the position of the XPS peak for the Mn 2p3/2 orbital, and the interesting ferromagnetic ordering obtained when x=0.5 and 0.7 in the La1‚àíxSrxMnO3. LSM has a rich electronic phase diagram, including a doping-dependent metal-insulator transition, paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. The existence of a Griffith phase has been reported as well. LSM is black in color and has a density of approximately 6.5 g/cm3. The actual density will vary depending on the processing method and actual stoichiometry. LSM is primarily an electronic conductor, with transference number close to 1. This material is commonly used as a cathode material in commercially produced solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) because it has a high electrical conductivity at higher temperatures, and its thermal expansion coefficient is well matched with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), a common material for SOFC electrolytes. In research, LSM is one of the perovskite manganites that show the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect, and is also an observed half- metal for compositions around x=0.3. LSM behaves like a half-metal, suggesting its possible use in spintronics. It displays a colossal magnetoresistance effect. Above its Curie temperature (about 350 K) Jahn-Teller polarons are formed; the material's ability to conduct electricity depends on the presence of the polarons.

Official reports of the clash indicate that the U.S. force suffered 2 soldiers dead and 11 wounded, while an estimated 32 insurgents were killed (out of an estimated force of 40‚Äì70 fighters). From a military perspective, the battle was a complete victory for the U.S. forces, which detected and defeated an insurgent force before it could launch a planned assault on Ramadi. From a political perspective, the action revealed the continuing ability of al-Qaeda in Iraq to plan and assemble forces in their attempt to destabilize the Anbar region. Battle On the night of 30 June 2007, a routine patrol on the outskirts of Ramadi revealed the presence of a company-sized element of insurgent forces. Partially hidden behind two trucks, the insurgents began firing on the reconnaissance group, forcing them to retreat to nearby cover and calling for backup forces. A platoon-sized element arrived a short while later to reinforce the American patrol. Although outnumbered, the U.S. force brought superior firepower to bear and eventually began to shift the tide of battle. With continuing ground fire, and later with air support, the American troops killed more than 30 insurgents and managed to destroy their two trucks carrying large quantities of weapons and ammunition before calm took over early in the morning. On 1 July, the insurgent fighters resumed the battle by ambushing elements of the U.S. Army, resulting in a quick firefight which ended the battle. In the following days, follow-up missions were conducted by the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marines on both sides of the canal to ensure all insurgent forces were eliminated.

The character was created by series' producer Katherine Fugate and is portrayed by actress Brigid Brannagh from the first through sixth seasons. Storylines Pamela comes from a family of police officers and firefighters and was a cop with Boston PD for three years. She left it to marry Chase and became a full-time housewife. The couple have two children Katie and Lucas, who was born while Chase was deployed. It is stated in Season 4 that they have been married for thirteen years. Due to an ever amounting debt, Pamela becomes a paid surrogate mother, for which she received $50,000. Much of the surrogacy is kept a secret between Pamela and Chase due to pride. However, because of a premature birth of the twins, the secret comes out to an additional few, which leads to a bond between fellow military spouses Claudia Joy Holden, Roxy LeBlanc, Dr. Roland Burton and Denise Sherwood. Pamela later becomes more comfortable talking about it and reveals the surrogacy to her children and to the rest of the post. Pamela is offered a job for the radio of the post but is later victim of stalking when a listener becomes obsessed with her. She also becomes the football coach. Throughout the first seasons, Pamela struggles with the constant absences of Chase due to his commitments to Delta Force and the secrecy of his deployments. This comes to a high when she asks him to quit Delta Force because he always prioritizes his career over their family. Since he refuses, they divorce in the fourth season. This causes her to move away from the post and she returns to her original occupation as a police officer to provide for her children. At the end of the fourth season, Chase announces to Pamela that he is ready to quit Delta Force and tells her that he wants to be with her again. Also she receives a job offer as detective in Atlanta. In the beginning of the fifth season, Pamela is really struggling to make a decision, her partner invites her on a date and later kisses her. Pamela rekindles her relationship with Chase later in the fifth season and they later remarry in the Hump Bar. At the end of the season, Chase receives a job offer in California which promises a better pay than his and Pamela's current salaries combined. Chase accepts the offer and moves there alone so that the children can finish their school year in Charleston. However, after their house gets damaged by a hurricane and because the children miss Chase, she decides to go to California. Characterization Describing her character, Brannagh said \\"Pamela is an ex cop married to a sergeant in Delta force. Which is definitely different than my life. But Pamela is a very straight forward person, and I would say that am very much straight forward, and she certainly follows her conscience and so do I, but we have a few differences as well. I love to cook ‚Äì she does not. And I like a very clean house, and if you saw the set this is clearly not Pamela‚Äôs priority.\\" and that \\"she‚Äôs really down to earth and a little acerbic\\". Reflecting on her character's development, she said: \\"Pamela started out a little more cranky and dry but has softened as a byproduct of her friendship with the other women.

History He was born in Knyszyn, Poland and studied at Ohel Torah Yeshiva in Baranowicze, led by Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. He later studied in the Mir Yeshiva located in the town of Mir, now in Belarus. At the onset of World War II, he traveled with the rest of the Mir Yeshiva to Vilna, where they remained for three weeks awaiting visas to travel abroad. After receiving destination visas to Cura√ßao, a Dutch protectorate in the Caribbean, they were given travel visas by the Japanese Consul in Kovno, Chiune Sugihara. The yeshiva traveled across the Trans- Siberian Railway to Vladivostok in a trip that took over two months. From there they traveled to Kobe, Japan, where they remained for 7 months before being settled by the Japanese Government in Shanghai, China. Following the war, Berenbaum traveled with the remnants of the Mir Yeshiva to the United States and settled in Brooklyn, New York. He married the eldest daughter of the Mir rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz. In 1964, after the passing of his father-in-law, he became the rosh yeshiva of the Mirrer Yeshiva together with his brother-in-law Rabbi Shraga Moshe Kalmanowitz. His diligence in Torah study was legendary and he was known to spend the entire day in the yeshiva's study hall discussing Torah topics with the students. As a policy, he would not attend any functions or weddings until after the afternoon seder in the yeshiva was over. This caused many weddings to take place late in the evening so as to allow him to officiate. He opposed his yeshiva students going to college, and later banned it outright. Some believe that he allowed the students to study for rabbinic ordination in order to satisfy their parents, who would otherwise want their children to attend college. After Berenbaum's first heart attack, the name Refoel was added to his name. Death Berenbaum's grave in the Sanhedria Cemetery of Jerusalem Berenbaum died on January 6, 2008 (28 Tevet 5768) at his home in Brooklyn from medical complications due to stomach cancer, aged 87. His funeral, held on January 7 at the Mir yeshiva, was attended by tens of thousands of mourners. His body was flown to Israel for burial in the Sanhedria Cemetery in Jerusalem.

While barely eight years of age, Luis was created 699th Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1735 and ordained Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain on 9 September 1735, and subsequently named Cardinal-Priest of the Title of the church of Santa Maria della Scala (pro hac vice) in Rome on 19 December. On 18 December 1754 he abandoned the ecclesiastical life for lack of vocation, renounced his ecclesiastical titles and dignities and assumed the title of 13th Conde de Chinch√≥n (Count of Chinch√≥n) granted by his brother Infante Felipe. When his older half-brother King Ferdinand VI died without issue in 1759, Luis claimed the throne on the grounds that, he was the only surviving son of Philip V still residing in Spain (his older brothers were Charles, King of Naples and Sicily, and Philip, Duke of Parma, both reigning in Italy). However valid his claim, Luis lost the succession to his oldest brother Charles, while Charles's third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Infante Luis was a patron of the arts and culture, and admirer of musician Luigi Boccherini, architect Ventura Rodr√≠guez and painters Francisco de Goya, Luis Paret y Alc√°zar, and Charles Joseph Flipart. \\"The Family of Philip V of Spain 1743\\"; (L-R) Mariana Victoria, Princess of Brazil; Barbara, Princess of Asturias; Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias; King Philip V; Luis, Count of Chinch√≥n; Elisabeth Farnese; Infante Philip; Louise √âlisabeth of France; Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela; Infanta Maria Antonia; Maria Amalia, Queen of Naples and Sicily; Charles, King of Naples and Sicily.

King Charles III, fearful of his brother, exiled Luis far away from the Court of Madrid. In 1776 at Olias del Rey Luis contracted a morganatic marriage with an Aragonese aristocrat, Mar√≠a Teresa de Vallabriga. This was much to the liking of Charles, because Luis now could not have children with a better claim to the throne. =Children= Since Luis's children had been born of a morganatic marriage, they could not receive royal titles, and thus the descendants of Charles were the legitimate Spanish heirs (even though the children of Charles had been born in Naples). The couple had four children: # Luis Mar√≠a de Borb√≥n y Vallabriga, 14th Count of Chinch√≥n (Cadalso de los Vidrios, 1777 - Madrid, 1823); # a stillborn; # Mar√≠a Teresa de Borb√≥n y Vallabriga, 15th Countess of Chinch√≥n; married in the Escorial, Madrid, 2 October 1797 Manuel de Godoy y √Ålvarez de Faria, 1st Principe de la Paz, 1st Duque de Alc√∫dia and 1st Duque de Sueca (Badajoz, 12 May 1767 ‚Äì Paris, 4 October 1851), and had issue, an only daughter Carlota Luisa Manuela. # Mar√≠a Luisa de Borb√≥n y Vallabriga (Toledo, 21 March 1780 - Paris, 1 December 1846), 98th Noble Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Mar√≠a Luisa on 10 October 1800, married in 1817 Joaqu√≠n Jos√© de Melgarejo y Saur√≠n, de Rojas y Ru√≠z-D√°valos (Cox, Alicante, 23 January 1780 - Madrid, 9 April 1835), 3rd Marqu√©s de Melgarejo and 1st Duke of San Fernando de Quiroga Grandee of Spain First Class with a Coat of Arms of de Melgarejo, 39th Minister of External Affairs of Spain (12 September 1819 ‚Äì 18 March 1820), without issue. She is the last surviving grandchild of Philip V of Spain. Charles had a great deal of appreciation and devotion to his younger brother, and even during his exile, Luis was treated quite well by the Spanish court. Luis loved his brother equally as much, which is why Luis later accepted Charles as king and accepted his exile. Despite this, Luis remained bitter and saddened by the fact that he lost the opportunity to be king. Luis died disgraced and in internal exile in 1785.

ECFS software does not work on the Apple Mac platform.  History  ECFS was conceived in November 2002 in Tarrant County, Texas. Initially, the purpose of the system was to enable law enforcement agencies to submit offense reports to the criminal district attorney's office for possible prosecution. In July 2003, the Criminal District Attorney's accepted the first electronic case filing via ECFS. Since that time, more than 100,000 cases have been filed in ECFS by the 47 Law Enforcement Agencies located in Tarrant County, Texas. ECFS was expanded in June 2004 to incorporate the Grand Jury function which is able to return Indictments to the Criminal District Courts on the same day that a True Bill is decided. In January 2005, ECFS was extended to enable the Judges and their Court Staff to effectively manage the docket (case load) for each of the nine (9) Criminal District Courts. Since the implementation of ECFS, Tarrant County has been able to control the Jail population, despite a significant increase in the number of cases being filed. In August 2005, ECFS was extended to enable members of the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to browse and view defendant, offense, and evidence via ECFS. Through this process, defense attorneys are no longer required to visit the Criminal District Attorney's Office to view and copy file. Since January 2006, the Criminal District Attorney's Office has been completely paperless and all Offense Reports are submitted via ECFS and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies, County and District Courts, and Defense Attorneys. In July 2006, ECFS was extended to allow criminal defendants to be magistrated electronically. This process also allows the Office of Attorney appointments to be notified that the defendant has requested that defense counsel be appointed which triggers a business process that captures financial information, facilitates a determination of indigency, and when appropriate appoints defense counsel. In 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a non-profit charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, to access the ECFS system. The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow subscribers to access files while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.

Hist. Soc. Colls., vol. LXXI (1914), especially p. 8), make it certain that Peter Pelham, Sr., was born later than 1671. The Registers of St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden, London (vol. I, 1906) show that Peter Pelham, Jr., and his wife Martha had children beginning with the christening of George Pelham on January 20, 1720. One can infer from these dates that the future artist was born about 1695, when his father would have been in his early twenties. His portrait, painted by his stepson, Copley, presumably from life or from records of his appearance about 1750, is not that of a 66-year-old man. (See Charles Pelham Curtis, Loan Exhibition of One Hundred Colonial Portraits, 1930.) ‚Äì December 1751), American limner and engraver, was born in England, a son of a man named \\"gentleman\\" in his will. His father, who died in Chichester, Sussex, in 1756, is revealed in letters to his son in America as a man of some property.He may have been related to the distinguished Pelhams of Sussex described in Mark Antony Lower's Historical and Genealogical Notices of the Pelham Family (1873), but the relationship has not been proved. London Pelham was one of several London artists who learned the then new technique of the mezzotint engraving. Of his use of the medium one writer has said: \\"Pelham handled the rocker heavily, and so gave to his prints a darker appearance than usual\\".Whitman, Alfred. The Masters of Mezzotint, 1898, p. 26. He obviously was well trained as a portrait painter, and he must have had influential connections, for between 1720 and 1726 he produced portrait plates of Queen Anne, George I, the Earl of Derby, Lord Wilmington, Lord Carteret, Lord Molesworth, Edmund Gibson, and others. Why, amidst such engagements, Pelham should have emigrated is mysterious, if, as seems quite certain, the poor schoolmaster, limner and engraver of Boston, Massachusetts, is identical with the well-employed mezzotinter of London. It is possible that he left in disgrace.See the letter of Peter Pelham, Sr., dated September 12, 1739, in the Copley-Pelham letters. His portrait of Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute, painted at London in 1724, was brought, according to plausible family tradition, to Boston to serve as introduction to local celebrities. Engraving of Mather Byles, a clergyman, by Pelham in 1732-1739 Boston Though various dates for his emigration have been suggested, the record of Peter Pelham's activities at Boston is well established. His portrait of the Rev. Cotton Mather, now at the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, was painted as copy for the very familiar mezzotint engraving, reproduced frequently. \\"Proposals\\" for printing this engraving were published in the Boston News-Letter on February 27, 1728. Portraits of several other New England clergymen followed. Pelham was seemingly intimate with John Smibert, who settled in Boston in 1730, for he painted Smibert's portrait and made several engravings after Smibert's works. Such professional labors did not produce a sufficient living for an ever- growing family, and Pelham opened a school at which he taught dancing, arithmetic, and other subjects. His first wife Martha dying in Boston, he married on October 15, 1734, Margaret Lowrey, and after her death he married, on May 22, 1748, Mary (Singleton) Copley, widow of Richard Copley, a recently deceased tobacconist originally from Limerick, Ireland. Their home, school, studio, and tobacco shop were on Queen Street (ca.1747)Boston Gazette, or Weekly Journal; Date: 07-21-1747 and Lindall Street.A Report of the Record Commissioners of the City of Boston, XV, 1886, p. 367. In this household were reared the future artists John Singleton Copley and Henry Pelham. Peter Pelham died without a will. Pelham's descendants included grandson William Pelham (1759-1827), a bookseller in Boston.William H. Whitmore. Who was Thomas Pelham?

They were able to link their BBS‚Äôs using a dial-up connection protocol enabling them to participate in discussion forums, send messages and share files. 1986: Establishment of first BBS in the Philippines, Star BBS was formed by Efren Tercias and James Chua of Wordtext Systems. Fox BBS was operated by Johnson Sumpio. First-Fil RBBS a public-access BBS went online with an annual subscription fee of P1,000. A precursor to the local online forum, it ran an open-source BBS software on an IBM XT Clone PC with a 1200bit/s modem and was operated by Dan Angeles and Ed Casta√±eda. 1987: The Philippine FidoNet Exchange, a local network for communication between several BBSes in Metro Manila, was formed. 1990: A committee helmed by Arnie del Rosario of the Ateneo Computer Technology Center was tasked with exploring the possibility of creating an academic network of universities and government institutions by the National Computer Center under Dr. William Torres. Recommendations were made but not implemented. 1991‚Äì1993: Emergence of email gateways and services in the Philippines, including some from multinational companies like Intel, Motorola, and Texas Instruments, which used a direct Internet connection, X.25, or UUCP protocol. Local firms ETPI, Philcom, and PLDT (Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company) also operated commercial X.25 networks. Another milestone: Local and international email to FidoNet users was introduced. June 1993: With the support of the Department of Science and Technology and the Industrial Research Foundation, the Philnet project (now PHNET) was born. The Philnet technical committee, composed of computer buffs working at the DOST [MIS (Joseph Andres), PCASTRD (Merl Opena, Winnefredo Aggabao) and Advanced Science and Technology Institute (Miguel Dimayuga)] and representatives from the Ateneo de Manila University (Richie Lozada and Arnie del Rosario), De La Salle University (Kelsey Hartigan-Go), University of the Philippines Diliman (Rodel Atanacio), University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (Alfonso Carandang), Xavier University (Bombim Cadiz) and St. Louis University (Ian Generalao); would eventually play a significant role in connecting the Philippines to the global Internet.\\"Villarica: The day the Philippines ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô the world\\", Dr. Rodolfo M. Villarica, Newsbytes.ph, 05 April 2014. July 1993: Phase one of the Philnet project shifted into full gear after receiving funding from the DOST. It proved to be successful, as students from partner universities were able to send emails to the Internet by routing them through Philnet's gateway at the Ateneo de Manila University, which was connected to another gateway at the Victoria University of Technology in Australia via IDD Dial-Up (Hayes Modem). November 1993: An additional P12.5-million grant for the first year's running cost was awarded by the DOST to buy equipment and lease communication lines needed to kickstart the second phase of Philnet, now led by Dr. Rudy Villarica. March 29, 1994, 1:15 a.m.: Benjie Tan, who was working for ComNet, a company that supplied Cisco routers to the Philnet project, established the Philippine's first connection to the Internet at a PLDT network center in Makati City. Shortly thereafter, he posted a short message to the Usenet newsgroup soc.culture.filipino to alert Filipinos overseas that a link had been made. His message read: \\"As of March 29, 1994 at 1:15 am Philippine time, unfortunately 2 days late due to slight technical difficulties, the Philippines was FINALLY connected to the Internet via SprintLink. The Philippine router, a Cisco 7000 router was attached via the services of PLDT and Sprint communications to SprintLink's router at Stockton Ca. The gateway to the world for the Philippines will be via NASA Ames Research Center. For now, a 64K serial link is the information highway to the rest of the Internet world.\\" March 29, 1994, 10:18 a.m.: \\"We're in,\\" Dr. John Brule, a Professor Emeritus in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Syracuse University, announced at The First International E-Mail Conference at the University of San Carlos in Talamban, Cebu, signifying that Philnet's 64 kbit/s connection was live.

The report is a pre-release of data from Nielsen's inaugural Southeast Asia Digital Consumer Report available September 30, 2011. Among the findings in this report were: * 43.5% of Filipinos accessed the Internet,five percentage points higher than the Southeast Asian regional average of 38%. * Internet penetration amongst consumers aged 15 to 19 was close to two-thirds (65%) and nearly half of those in their 20s were online (48%). * There was still much room for growth for those aged 30+ ‚Äì less than one quarter of consumers aged in their 30s (24%) access the Internet, 13% of consumers in their 40s, and just 4% of consumers aged 50+. * 52% of Filipinos had a computer with high speed Internet connection at home. * Home was the most common Internet access point for those aged 30 years and above close to nine in ten Internet users aged 50 years and above (86%) cite \\"home\\" as their main point of access. * 74% of 15‚Äì19 years identified Internet caf√©s as their main point of Internet access. *Close to one quarter of Filipinos Internet users (24%) accessed the Internet on a daily basis via a mobile phone and 56% intend to access the Internet via a mobile phone in the next 12 months. * Over two thirds of Filipino digital consumers (67%) had visited social networking sites, compared to 40% who used email. * The Philippines ranked second highest for the number of people who had ever \\"liked\\" or followed a brand, company or celebrity on a social networking site (75%). * 61% of Filipino Internet users said they trusted consumer opinions posted online, higher than any other market in Southeast Asia and seven points above the regional average. * Online product reviews and discussion forums were one of the most trusted sources of recommendations in purchase decision making, second only to recommendations from family and friends. * Close to two thirds of digital Filipinos (64%) used social media as a resource in purchase decision making. Wireless broadband =TD-LTE= As the number of subscribers grew, both PLDT and Globe Telecom rapidly expanded their Time- Division Duplex-Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE) services for Fixed Wireless Broadband. According to PLDT, they spent P2 billion of its P28.8 billion capital expenditure for 2013 to bring TD-LTE technology to customers‚Äô homes. According to industry data, the Philippines‚Äô TD-LTE network was one of the largest deployments in Asia Pacific with over 200 base stations and an allocated bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (Mbps). In January 2015, both PLDT and Globe Telecom began phasing out WiMax services in favor for TD-LTE. Bandwidth caps In October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called \\"volume boosters\\" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD- LTE connection plans (Ultera). \\"In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle.\\" Globe followed the suit with a similar \\"volume boost\\" arrangement. Lock-in period In 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions. As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period. The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: \\"8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber‚Äôs responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber‚Äôs continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions.\\" Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states \\"Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier\\", the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet. IP peering The Philippines have six Internet Exchange points in the Country. Philippine Open Internet Exchange (PhOPENIX), Philippine Internet Exchange (PhIX), Philippine Common Routing Exchange (PHNET CORE), Globe Internet Exchange (GIX), Bayan Telecommunications Internet and Gaming Exchange and Manila Internet Exchange (Manila IX). On June 16, 2016, Globe Telecom and PLDT agreed on a bilateral domestic IP peering arrangement. Internet speed The Akamai Technologies Q1 2017 State of the Internet report contained information that, though average internet connection speed had increased 20% year-on-year, the Philippines, at 5.5 Mbit/s, once again had the lowest average connection speeds among surveyed Asia Pacific countries/regions. The report noted that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had approved a plan with a three to five- year timeline for completion to deploy a national broadband network at an estimated cost of US$1.5 billion to $4.0 billion. Internet censorship Access to the Internet in the Philippines stays as unrestricted as the constitutional legislative framework. There are neither overt Internet access government restrictions nor reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority or judicial oversight. Individuals and groups are permitted to engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. The constitution and law broadly provide for the right of freedom of thought, expression and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Around 6.5% of the country's population got access to the Internet according to International Telecommunication Union statistics.\\"2010 Human Rights Report: Philippines\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State. 2011-04-08 The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the authorities generally prohibit those from happening in practice.

By 2008, Israel had become one of the few countries with developed broadband capabilities across two types of infrastructure‚Äîcable and DSL‚Äîreaching over 95% of the population. Actual broadband market penetration stands at 77%, ranked 7th in the world. in 2010, Israel was ranked 26th in The Economist's Digital Economy Rankings. Internet in Israel is provided through the phone and cable infrastructures, by Bezeq and Hot respectively. Bezeq provides dial-up and ADSL, while HOT provides cable Internet services. Every ADSL or cable Internet user has to pay separately to the infrastructure provider and to the ISP, due to competition laws. Unlimited, a new company formed as a subsidiary of Israel's electric company and other telecom companies, is expected to become the third competitor in the infrastructure market in 2015, and will provide customers with symmetrical FTTH residential lines starting at 100Mbit/s and up to 1Gbit/s. History In November 1990, the undersea cable EMOS-1, connecting Israel with Turkey, Greece and Italy, was deployed. This was the first Israeli-built undersea cable, and was augmented by CIOS in April 1994. Since then, other cables have been laid which have provided large capacity links between Israel and abroad. Until 1997, most domestic Internet traffic was routed either directly between ISPs, or through the Israeli universities' academic network operated by the IUCC. Since 1997, the Israel Internet Association has been responsible for operating the Israeli Internet Exchange (IIX) through which much of the domestic Internet traffic is routed. Broadband Internet has been available in Israel via ADSL since the late 1990s in theory, but it only became practical to an average residential customer in 2001. This was enabled by a significant upgrade to the Internet infrastructure in 1999, at a cost of over a billion shekels. Since then prices have dropped considerably. Also in 2001, the Communications Law of 1982 was amended to allow the provision of broadband Internet through the cable infrastructure. Connection specifications The average download speed in household broadband connections in Israel is 67Mbit/s, while upload speeds average at 16Mbit/s. Maximum speeds via the cable modem provider's (Hot) connection are 200 Mbit/s down and 5 Mbit/s up for consumers (and 500Mbit/s down and 10Mbit/s up for business customers in select markets) over DOCSIS 3.0, a service started on October 21, 2009. All ADSL services require and use the PPPoE protocol, and cable modem connections generally operate over DHCP. For speed under 30Mbit/sec, a cable user can select to use VPNs using the PPTP/L2TP protocol. Bezeq, the major local exchange carrier, began rolling out their Next Generation Network (NGN) in 2009 with theoretical speeds up to 100 Mbit/s by using a combination of fiber to the curb (FTTC) and ADSL2+/VDSL2 technologies. Initial product offerings of their NGN were 10 Mbit/s and 15 Mbit/s download and 800 kbit/s upload speeds over ADSL2+, with a best effort package of up to 100 Mbit/s available starting October 2010. According to Bezeq, NGN is slated to reach 90 percent of the households in Israel by late 2011 and offerings of 100 Mbit/s will be provided in 2012. Its main cable competitor, HOT, using DOCSIS 3.0 infrastructure which allow higher bandwidths. The three largest mobile phone carriers, Pelephone, Partner, and Cellcom, offer HSPDA service, typically 24 Mbit/s, over their respective 3G networks as well. Partner was the first provider to operate a consumer 4G (LTE) network, reaching a theoretical symmetrical speed of 100Mbit/s. As of today, all major mobile carriers offer 4G LTE Advanced connectivity in the 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies, available in most populated regions in Israel, however these services are limited to about 20% of their maximum speeds since the Israeli Ministry of Communications has not completed allocating the full spectrum of the required frequencies. =ISP interconnectivity= Israel is connected abroad by three undersea cables: MedNautilus, owned by Telecom Italia, the Bezeq International Optical System, and Tamares Telecom's submarine cable. Domestic connectivity is provided by the Israel Internet eXchange (IIX), a central meeting point of the Internet Service Providers in Israel. Internet service providers Due to competition laws, every DSL or cable Internet user has to pay separately to the infrastructure provider and to the Internet service provider (ISP). Infrastructure is provided by Bezeq (via dial-up and DSL) and Hot (cable Internet). All cellular companies (Pelephone, Partner, Cellcom and Mirs) provide wireless Internet infrastructure, and also serve as Internet service providers. The three main Internet service providers are 012 Smile, 013 Netvision (including Internet Rimon) and Bezeq International. In 2006, the companies held market shares of 34, 33 and 30 percent, respectively, although these numbers include international phone calls. In all, as of August 2012, there were 43 companies with ISP licenses given by the Ministry of Communications. = Satellite = In Israel, Gilat Satellite Networks provides multi-gigabit per second broadband access to consumers and the defense industry by means of high throughput satellites.http://www.spacenews.com/article/financial-report/41668satellite- telecom-ground-equipment-maker-gilat-expects-to-shake-off Future plans A third landline Internet infrastructure is being built by the Israel Electric Corporation, which will provide fiber to the home access in the country, starting with Beersheba. This follows a March 6, 2011 communications ministry approval. The network is called \\"Unlimited\\" and will provide up to 1 Gbit/s access to Israeli homes. After the network is laid, speeds above 1 Gbit/s will be possible. Bezeq is also set to conduct a similar pilot in Petah Tikva in 2012, paving the way for FTTH connections in Israel. By 2020, the 160 tbps Quantum Cable will be added to the array of submarine communication cables that land in Israel.http://cyprus-mail.com/2018/01/18/quantum-cable- revolutionise-global-telecoms/ In the same year, a 5G cellular network is expected to begin operating in the country. Internet censorship In August 2009 no evidence of filtering was found by ONI in all areas. The Orthodox Jewish parties in Israel came up with an internet filtering law, only making pornographic Internet site access permissive for users who identify themselves as adults and request not to be subject to filtering. In February 2008 the law passed in its first of three votes required, however, the government's law committee declined it.

Ertso-Tianeti is located on the southern foothills of the Greater Caucasus mountains. Its historical borders are: Pshavi to the north, Kakheti to the south and east, and the Aragvi River on the west. History of Tianeti District. The Regional Administration of Mtskheta-Mtianeti website. Accessed on August 19, 2007.  History  Ertso-Tianeti was historically part of the saeristavo (duchy) of Kakheti. According to Georgian tradition and accounts from the 11th century, Saint Nino converted the inhabitants of the region to Christianity along with the rest of Iberia, c. 330. Due to its geographical location, Ertso-Tianeti was a region of great strategic and economical significance during the Middle Ages. It was traversed by a branch of the commercial road joining Kartli with Caucasian Albania and Armenia. During this period (6-9th centuries), Tianeti served as the foothold from which the lords of Kartli extended their political and cultural influence over the Greater Caucasus. During the struggle for unification of Georgia (10th century), the Kingdom of Abkhazia used the conquest of Tianeti to bring Kakheti into their allegiance. In the 13th century Ertso-Tianeti had to endure the Mongol invasions. In the 15th century, after the collapse of the unified Kingdom of Georgia, Ertso- Tianeti became one of the samouravo (districts) of the Kingdom of Kakheti. Its territory was the object of frequent conflicts between Kakheti and the Duchy of Aragvi. In 1614, the area was virtually depopulated as a result of the Persian invasion of the Kakheti. The vacated villages were later resettled by migrants from the neighboring mountain regions of Pshavi and Khevsureti, with which economic links have always been strong.

Her mother Marda tells Trevor in Season 1 that Roxy's father died when Roxy was five but never clarified whether he was her biological father or not. Marda was an alcoholic and a hair stylist who married two more times and had a string of relationships with various men. At age seventeen Roxy became pregnant by her high school sweetheart Jesse and dropped out to marry him and work. Jesse started drinking and became abusive. She left him after he punched her when she was six months pregnant with TJ. Several years later she began a relationship with childhood friend Whit and they had a son Finn, but never married. For some time she lived in a trailer on food stamps and welfare. Roxy eventually fulfills her lifelong goal of finishing high school when she passes her GED exam with Roland's help in Season 2. Roxy has a love-hate relationship with her mother due to a difficult childhood and her mother's drinking. It is revealed that she never mentioned Marda when she accepted Trevor's marriage proposal. At times Trevor inadvertently found himself in between mother and daughter and has tried, albeit unsuccessfully at first, to mend their relationship. Storylines In the pilot episode PFC Trevor LeBlanc made the trip west to Tuscaloosa from Fort Marshall in Charleston, South Carolina to propose to her, the two having only started dating four days earlier. She accepts and moves to his post with her two sons. Initially she felt out of place and uncomfortable with the military protocol and decorum. During her first division banquet she meets fellow Army spouses Claudia Joy Holden, Denise Sherwood and Dr. Roland Burton and is invited to a tea party hosted by Claudia Joy, who then introduces her to Pamela Moran. The five of them bond despite their very different individual backgrounds. She is best friends with Pamela as they used to live several blocks from one another and their children are of similar age. She sees Claudia Joy and Denise as \\"older sister\\" figures and often sought their advice, especially regarding marital issues. At Trevor's persuasion to \\"get out\\" and make new friends, Roxy accepts the invitation of several wives to go to The Hump Bar, a favorite haunt of service personnel and locals. To her horror, she realizes that the wives were there to hit on civilian men while their husbands were deployed. Seeing a \\"helped wanted\\" sign, she gets a job as a bartender there. She befriends the deadpan owner Betty Camden and becomes a surrogate daughter to her. Despite a noticeable lack of business savvy, her street sense more than compensates. When Betty dies, Roxy briefly renames the bar \\"Betty's Place,\\" but has since changed it back to the Hump Bar. During the first season Roxy is forced to quickly adapt to life at Fort Marshall and her role as an Army wife. Her naivete was often a source of comedy in the show. For example, she personally pleads with Trevor's platoon sergeant SFC Hendrix in front of the entire platoon to spare him for the day after learning that he has blisters on his foot; this backfires as Trevor was mercilessly teased about the incident by SFC Hendrix and his platoon mates for the rest of the exercise and given the demeaning nickname \\"Baby Soft\\". During her first divisional banquet she salutes a bemused Major Frank Sherwood when he was notifying Trevor about being accepted into jump school. In Season 5 she talks the housing officer into reviewing hers and Trevor's housing situation by using his rank and her friendship with Claudia Joy Holden, much to Trevor's embarrassment. In Season 3 Trevor brings home Lucky, a dog Jeremy Sherwood managed to smuggle out of Iraq with the help of friends. Roxy is initially furious, especially after Lucky accidentally runs past and bumps into her and while she was trimming her hair, causing her to snip off a significant portion. She relents after seeing how the boys enjoyed having a pet. Lucky also became a welcome distraction for her and the boys when she suffered a miscarriage in Season 4 and while Trevor was deployed in from the latter part of Season 4 to the beginning of Season 5. Trevor's second deployment proves to more difficult for Roxy due to Jeremy's death and TJ's rebellious streak. In Season 5, Whit, Finn's biological father, visits to give some money from a small inheritance toward Finn's education. Roxy subsequently hires Whit to work as a contractor on a truck stop business project. With Trevor away in Afghanistan, she begins to feel close to her old flame again, though she resists acting on it. Roxy finds out Trevor is coming home early. She panics and tries to fire Whit, much to the chagrin of her business partner. However Trevor is noticeably distant and avoids her for over a week. They eventually talk out their differences and reconcile. She admits to Trevor that the truck stop project was motivated by her fear of hers and the boys' future should Trevor be killed in action after learning that he was just several feet away from where Jeremy was killed. With Trevor's promotion to Second Lieutenant in season 6, they move to a bigger house and Roxy becomes the FRG leader for his company. As FRG leader she befriends and helps new Army wives adjust to life at Fort Marshall. Roxy also finds out that she is pregnant with twins. She and Trevor spend a weekend with Pamela and Chase in Miami and Trevor is offered a job by Chase at his security firm. Roxy tries to persuade Trevor into taking up the offer but he refuses and it causes tension between them. Her mother Marda visits them during this time, only to find herself in the middle of a \\"cold war\\" between Roxy and Trevor. Roxy confesses that she hoped Trevor would leave the Army so that she would not have to constantly worry about him and his deployments. Before her departure Marda sternly reminds Roxy of what her life what was like before meeting Trevor and that the fact that Trevor truly loves her and the boys should be what matters most. In the 100th episode Roxy gives birth to twin boys, Wyatt and Drew. Wyatt is born vaginally, without complications but cord is wrapped around Drew's neck and Roxy has to have an emergency cesarean section. Drew had to be put into an incubator while Roxy gets to take Wyatt home. Not long after, Drew finally gets to go home. At the conclusion of the season, the family moves to Tacoma, Washington when Trevor is \\"PCS-ed\\" to Fort Lewis. She continues to own the Hump Bar, but leaves the day-to-day operations to Gloria Cruz, who is now the manager. In Season 7 Roxy briefly returns to visit Fort Marshall with the twins to attend Claudia Joy's funeral. She had been on a road trip with Trevor and the boys and took a detour to Charleston after learning about Claudia Joy's death. Characterization Roxy is known as one of the more outspoken and honest of the wives. In the Season 1 episode \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" she tells Trevor that she \\"gets jealous easily\\" and tends to speak her mind. In Seasons 2 and 3 she stepped in when a flirtatious customer and waitress tried to flirt with her husband, although Trevor displayed no interest in their overtures. Sally Pressman said of Roxy: \\"She's so much fun, she's so honest, she's so loving, and I also love when she sticks her foot in her mouth all the time. And I like that she doesn't take anyone's crap but she's a really good person at the same time.\\" She added that \\"the nitty gritty, southern, no-frills bar\\" is what really represents her. The New Zealand Herald described Roxy as \\"a slapper with a heart of gold.\\" She was loyal and was always the strong one. Reception The Chicago Tribune named Roxy \\"the most problematic character\\" because she does \\"preposterous and downright stupid things\\" in the first episodes. However, Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette deemed her and Trevor \\"the liveliest couple\\", adding the show \\"sparks to life anytime these two are on screen.\\" See also *List of fictional supercouples *Quotes References External links * Roxy LeBlanc at Lifetime Army Wives characters Fictional bartenders Fictional characters from Alabama Television characters introduced in 2007 American female characters in television ka:·É∞·Éî·Éò·Éö·Éò ·ÉØ·Éî·Éò·Éõ·É° ·É°·Éô·Éù·É¢·Éò sr:–•–µ—ò–ª–∏ –è–µ—ò–º—Å-–°–∫–æ—Ç ","title":"Roxy LeBlanc"},{"id":"12841045","text":"A Brewerytown Romance is a 1914 American short silent comedy film featuring Oliver Hardy.

Hoskins MBE (1892 Waitara, New Zealand ‚Äì 1987 Kent, England) was the most significant promoter of speedway and stock car racing in the United Kingdom, he is considered by some to have invented motorcycle speedway.WestEnder ‚Äì Top Stories Early life Born at Waitara, Hoskins grew up in New Zealand, where he left school at thirteen and worked on a farm, before becoming a postman. He next decided to try his luck in Australia, working as a telegraph operator at Wagga Wagga, then moving on to Sydney. After running low on funds in Sydney, Hoskins got on a train with enough money to get him as far as West Maitland. When he arrived there, he met some friends who helped him to set up a charity sports programme, including boxing and street stalls, which he ran with some success. He was elected Charity Carnival organiser for the Local Hunter River Agricultural Horticultural Society, when the secretary resigned, so Hoskins took on his position, too. First speedway meeting At that time regular fund raising Carnivals were staged on the Maitland Showground by various bodies. As a keen motorcycling enthusiast, Hoskins tried to convince the Agricultural Horticultural Society committee to allow motorcycle races around the showground's trotting track. =Electric Light Carnival= On 1 December 1923, the following notice appeared in the local newspaper, the Maitland Daily Mercury: In his capacity as Secretary to the Local Hunter River Agricultural Horticultural Society, Hoskins organised a sports charity carnival called the Electric Light Carnival, staged on the Maitland Showground on 15 December 1923, to benefit the local orphanages as well as the Local Hunter River Agricultural Horticultural Society. The programme of events staged that night consisted of horse races, including trotting, cycling events, athletics, and motorcycle racing. This was the first time motorcycle racing had been staged at the venue, and this date is widely recognised as the day on which motorcycle speedway in its current form was born. Hoskins ran speedway at Maitland for two years and then moved on to Newcastle in New South Wales. Newcastle, Sydney and Claremont In 1925, Hoskins intensified his motorcycle speedway racing career when he became Secretary of the promotional Newcastle Speedway Company Ltd., based at Newcastle. He also promoted speedway at the Sydney Showground during the first season of racing there in 1926‚Äì1927, but a very wet summer made the venture a flop and almost bankrupted Hoskins. He then moved on to Western Australia, where in 1927 he began promoting sports events at the Claremont Showground near Perth. Within a month he had made almost ¬£1,000,Heartbreak sent me to West Maitland an amount which for most people at that time was several years' income. United Kingdom In 1928, Hoskins decided to try promoting speedway in the United Kingdom. He set sail on the Oronsay, arriving in England without the use of a suitable track. =Wembley= Sir Arthur Elvin, the chairman of Wembley Stadium, a well-known national sports venue, asked Hoskins to promote speedway at Wembley in the 1929 season. He accepted, and the Wembley Lions team was born.Jacobs, N & Lipscombe, P., Wembley Speedway : The Pre-War Years (Stroud: Tempus Publishing, 2005, ) =West Ham= In 1930 the promotion at the West Ham Stadium went broke so Hoskins acquired the promoting rights for the West Ham Hammers and ran the club for nine successful seasons until the outbreak of World War II.Belton, Brian, Hammerin' Round (Stroud: Tempus Publishing, 2003, ) In 1933, while he was at West Ham, Hoskins appeared in the British film Money for Speed, which starred John Loder, Ida Lupino, Cyril McLaglen and Moore Marriott. Ginger Lees, Lionel Van Praag and Frank Varey also featured. =After the war= Hoskins promoted or co-promoted many clubs and was a real force in British speedway. His last such involvement was with the Canterbury Crusaders, which he founded in 1968 at the age of seventy-five, continuing for another ten years. He died in 1987, at the age of ninety-four.

Born in Reno, Nevada, he has made his home in the San Francisco Bay Area for many decades. Brady is a multi-faceted artist who works in ceramics, wood, painting, and illustration, and is best known for his abstract figurative sculptures. Brady came out of the California Clay movement, and the Bay Area Arts scene of the 1950s and 1960s, which includes artists such as Peter Voulkos, Viola Frey, Stephen de Staebler, and Robert Arneson who was his mentor and teacher in college.  Education  During his senior year in high school, Brady was trying to fill an elective requirement at the last minute when he enrolled in a pivotal arts and crafts class. He credits his teacher, Tom Tucker, with changing the direction of his life by inspiring his future career in ceramics. After high school, Brady attended the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC, currently known as California College of the Arts, or CCA) in Oakland, California, from 1964 to 1968, and received his BFA in 1969. After graduating he did a short stint in the United States Navy, but was still unsure of where his future lay when he got out, so spent some time painting houses in order to support himself and his first wife. A chance encounter with an article on famous ceramic artist Isamu Noguchi reignited the fire Brady previously felt for clay, and he immediately switched gears, deciding to go back to school to receive a master's degree from the University of California in Davis. During his time at UC Davis, Brady learned under acclaimed artists Robert Arneson and Manuel Neri. Later, while working at CCAC as a guest artist and instructor in 1978, Brady learned the art of Raku during a workshop from Hal Riegger[1], (author and pioneer of Raku in the U.S.), and subsequently began teaching those workshops alongside Riegger out in the California desert. Brady first gained critical acclaim right after leaving school, when he caught the attention of some well-known art collectors during his first solo show. Those collectors were impressed by his 5-foot and 6-foot coil-built vessels; soon Brady's work began appearing in decor and fashion magazines. This exposure was an instrumental factor in launching his professional art career.  Materials and methods  Brady initiated his career in the ceramic arts, by investigating and experimenting with form and color, including Raku glazes, polychromy, oil pastels and mixed- media. In his smaller earthenware vessels, he tested the effects of pigmented clays and monotype printing methods on the clay. In making his large scale, and semi-abstract, figurative work, Brady initially used clay and bronze. However, starting in the late 1980s, he began a transition into using wood. He found the material more suited to creating the large scale, thin and elongated, yet often top-heavy sculptures he was making. These, and many other pieces of his, show an affinity for a very primal and ancient type of folk art which Brady has been exploring for decades. Including the ceramic, wood, and bronze sculptures, Brady has additionally used a variety of materials and methods to create masks, prints, paintings, and drawings to communicate through his art.  Teaching career  Brady has enjoyed a long and varied career as a teacher and honored professor of ceramics and art from the mid-1970s well into the early 2000s. His teaching jobs have spanned the U.S. from California to Maine, and Hawaii to Alaska, and overseas teaching opportunities have taken Brady to Japan, Canada, England, Jamaica, and Italy. His first job as an instructor was in the department of art at California State University, Sacramento (SSU) where he was an associate professor. While at SSU he taught ceramics and drawing from 1975 to 1980, and again from 1982 to 1985. He also worked at the American River College in Sacramento, California, in 1975, and at the Appalachian Center for Craft in Smithville, Tennessee (a campus of Tennessee Tech School of Art, Craft & Design) (https://www.tntech.edu/craftcenter/), where his wife, artist Sandy Simon, also taught. Having been a guest instructor/artist/speaker at innumerable schools, art centers, potteries and museums over the years, Brady has generously shared his wealth of knowledge with generations of other artists and art lovers. He has said, ‚ÄúThe greatest reward in my career as an artist is the satisfaction of creating and discovery,\\" and, \\"Being an artist has led to the appreciation and integration of aesthetic awareness in all aspects of my life. I am grateful for the rich and provocative life afforded me by being a member of the arts community.\\"  Collections  = Museum work = Many collections of Brady's artwork can be found around the world. Examples of the work can be found in The Crocker Art Museum (Sacramento, California), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), the Oakland Museum of California (OMCA), the Honolulu Museum of Art, and the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). = Gallery work = The Stremmel Gallery (https://localwiki.org/reno- sparks/Stremmel_Gallery), Reno, Nevada The Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Renwick Gallery, Washington, D.C.http://www.askart.com/askart/artist.aspx?artist=100807 Robert David Brady on AskArt.com = Public installations = Public works of Brady's can be found at The Crocker Art Museum, the di Rosa Preserve in Napa, Ca, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), as well as in North Carolina, Little Rock, Arkansas, Salt Lake City, Utah, New York, West Palm Beach, Florida, Chicago, Illinois, North Dakota, Sacramento, California, and in Amsterdam. This artist has no relationship to the Robert Brady Museum (Museo Robert Brady) in Cuernavaca, Mexico founded by a different Robert Brady (1928‚Äì1986).  Recognition  Brady has received multiple fellowships from the National Endowment of the Arts in 1981, 1988, 1989, and 2008. He was also elected Fellow of the American Craft Council in 2007, and has been awarded the title Professor Emeritus for Sacramento State University where he taught for 33 years.

This sometimes fatal disease was first discovered in Northern Luzon, Philippines in 1964. Cases have also been reported from China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Korea, Lao PDR, Taiwan and Thailand. Cases diagnosed in Italy and Spain were believed to be acquired abroad, with one case possibly contracted in Colombia. The natural life cycle of C. philippinensis is believed to involve fish as intermediate hosts, and fish-eating birds as definitive hosts. Humans acquire C. philippinensis by eating small species of infested fish whole and raw. Discovery and nomenclature Capillaria philippinensis egg. Between the first case reported in 1964 and the end of 1967, more than 1000 cases were documented in and around Northern Luzon particularly at Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, including 77 deaths. Witch doctors were hired by the locals to exorcise the curse placed on them by the river god, which they believed was responsible for this sudden disaster. In 1968, the cause was identified as Capillaria philippinensis. Adult C. philippinensis are very small, with males measuring 1.5-3.9 mm long and 23-28 ¬µm maximum width, while adult females are 2.3-5.3 mm long and 29-47 ¬µm maximum width. Eggs measure 36-45 ¬µm long and 20 ¬µm wide, and are described as peanut-shaped with a striated shell. This species has been transferred to the genus Aonchotheca, as Aonchotheca philippinensis, and to the genus Paracapillaria, as Paracapillaria philippinensis. However, this species is almost universally referred to as Capillaria philippinensis in the current medical literature. Hosts and life cycle Capillaria philippinensis life cycle. The complete life cycle of C. philippinensis has been demonstrated in experimental studies, and may be either indirect (involving an intermediate host) or direct (complete in one host). Indirect life cycle. Fish-eating birds which harbor adult C. philippinensis in their intestines, shed embryonated eggs in their feces. When these eggs are fed to uninfected fish, C. philippinensis larvae are recovered from the intestines of fish. If the fish are fed to uninfested birds, the larvae develop into adults in the intestinal tract of the birds. Larvae recovered from the fish also developed into adults when fed to gerbils or monkeys, with eggs shed in the feces of these mammalian hosts. Naturally infested fish (Hypseleotris bipartita and Apagon sp.) and birds (Ixobrychus sp.) have also been found. Humans become infested when they eat raw or undercooked fish, probably small fish eaten whole, which have the infective larvae in their intestinal tract. Raw fish are commonly eaten by several of the Asian cultures in which C. philippinensis infestations have been found. While the natural host range is not known, experimental infestations of several fishes, including Cyprinus carpio, Puntius gonionotus, Rasbora borapetensis, Eleotris melanosoma, Ambassis commersoni and Apogon sp., with C. philippinensis eggs yielded infective larvae. Experimental infestations with larvae of several birds, including Amaurornis phoenicurus, Ardeola bacchus, Nycticorax nycticorax, Bubulcus ibis, Ixobrychus sinensis, Gallinula chloropus, and Rostratula benghalensis yielded mature adults. Direct life cycle. Researchers also found that feeding just a few dozen larvae from the intestines of fish to Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) or monkeys (Macaca sp.) led to infestations with thousands of adult worms through \\"autoinfection\\". Autoinfection is when the offspring produced by adults can reinfest the same host, allowing the infestation to multiply within a single host animal. Both oviparous (egg-laying) and larviparous (giving birth to active larvae) adult female C. philippinensis were found in Mongolian gerbils and some birds. The experimentally infested monkeys never developed any clinical symptoms, even during prolonged, active infestations. Of several rodents tested, only Mongolian gerbils developed severe symptoms due to infestation and died. Pathology Although C. philippinensis infections are rare, it can serve as an indicator that one is being exposed to raw or undercooked fish. Early diagnosis of the parasite is beneficial so the number of worms in an infected person would not increase. Worms create infection by penetrating the mucosa of the small intestine and reentering the lumen. As they progress into the body, they cause the mucosa and submucosa to degenerate. Infected people can have abdominal pains, diarrhea, weight loss, weakness, malaise, anorexia, and emaciation. They also experience loss of proteins and electrolytes and malabsorption of fats and sugars. If symptoms and the number of worms increase, it can eventually lead to death. Diagnosis This parasite can be diagnosed by taking a tissue biopsy from the small intestine or by examining stool samples through a microscope. In a heavily infected person, it is best to examine their feces because it will show an abundance of adult worms and eggs. When looking at the eggs of C. philippinensis, one must be able to distinguish it from the eggs of Trichuris trichiura. C. philippinensis eggs have nonprotruding polar plugs and are slightly smaller than Trichuris trichiura eggs. Treatment C. philippinensis infections should be treated with 200 mg of mebendazole. This drug is taken twice a day for 20 days or until all symptoms subside and there are no longer eggs present in the stool samples of the patient.

Early life May was born in Sandisfield, Massachusetts and at the age of four moved to Richland, Michigan. He worked there on a farm until the age of fifteen and became a student of the State University (now Western Michigan University) at Kalamazoo. He studied law in Bennington, Vermont and Battle Creek, Michigan and was admitted to the bar in 1854. From November 1855 to October 1856, May was associate political editor of the Detroit Daily Tribune and its Washington, D. C. correspondent. He commenced the practice of law in Battle Creek, but soon returned to Kalamazoo where he was elected prosecuting attorney in 1860. May resigned in 1861, and raised Company K, Second Michigan Infantry, the first volunteer company from Kalamazoo, and was commissioned as captain in the Union Army. He participated in several of the early battles, including the battle of Bull Run and Blackburn's Ford. He resigned due to ill health. Politics In 1862, May was elected the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan and served from 1863 to 1865. The following year he was a member of the 1866 Republican state convention. In 1872, he broke party ranks and supported Democrat Horace Greeley for U. S. President against the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant and was a losing Democratic candidate for U. S. Senate in 1876. He then practiced law in Detroit and later returned to practice law in Kalamazoo. Retirement and death In 1888, May retired due to ill health and built a country home, ‚ÄúIsland View‚Äù, overlooking Gull Lake where he wrote several newspaper and magazine articles and several books. He died of heart disease there just three days after his seventy-first birthday. He is interred at Mountain Home Cemetery, Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Michigan, USA. Family life May was the son of Rockwell May (1799 - 1895) and Celestia E Underwood May (1800 - 1889). He married Cornelia E Myers about 1851 and after her death in 1852, he married Eliza Edna Dailey in about 1853. They had four children, Charles Frederick, Gordon Allen, Cornelia Eliza, and Allen Potter. His brother Dwight May was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1867.

Naming  According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, the \\"three hollows\\" in the Irish name are probably the valleys of Derrymore (north), Derryquay (north-east) and Curraheen (east), which cut into the sides of the mountain.  Geography  Baurtregaum is the highest mountain of the Slieve Mish range, which is situated on the eastern end of the Dingle Peninsula, in Kerry. It is connected by a western ridge to the 2nd-highest peak in the range, Caherconree . Baurtregaum has several subsidiary peaks including, Baurtregaum NW Top , Baurtregaum NE Top (with northern spur Scragg), and Baurtregaum Far NE Top . The most notable of Baurtgreaum's \\"three hollows\\" is the northerly Derrymore Glen, through which the Derrymore River runs, and which contains three scenic lakes, bounded by the steep valley walls of Baurtregaum and Caherconree and the peak of Gerhane . Also notable is the easterly Curraheen Glen, through which the Curraheen River runs, is bounded by the long easterly ridge from Baurtregaum to Baurtregaum Far NE Top. Baurtregaum's prominence of qualifies it as a Marilyn, and it also ranks it as the 6th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres.  Hill walking  The popular route is the Derrymore Glen Horseshoe, a 11-kilometre 5-hour loop that starts from the base of the Derrymore Glen and ascends to the first summit of Gearhane , and then around the \\"horseshoe\\" to Caherconree and the summit of Baurtregaum. Options for the descent use either the Baurtregaum NW Top spur or the Baurtregaum NE Top Spur (and the Scragg) to get back to the base of the Glen. The route is recommended for its views of the Glen as well as incorporating most of the main peaks of the Slieve Mish range, and thus is also called The Slieve Mish Circuit in some guidebooks.

A career soldier, Sir Henry was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in the 23rd Foot, Royal Welsh Fusiliers in 1849. His rise through the ranks was very rapid, reaching the rank of Colonel in 1864, Major General in 1869 and finally Lieutenant-General in 1884; when he was appointed to command British troops in South Africa. He was only 52 when he arrived in Cape Town, his exceptional ability reflected in the high rank he held at a comparatively early age. Within ten days of his arrival he had launched the game of golf in South Africa. Thus the Cape Golf Club (the forerunner of Royal Cape) came into being. Sir Henry‚Äôs final posting was as Governor and Commander-in-Chief Malta. He arrived in Malta on 28 September 1888 and within one month he had founded Royal Malta; with a clubhouse in St Anne‚Äôs Ditch and a 9-hole course laid out around the bastions (better known as the Hornworks) of Valletta. Not much of a golf course - with practically no turf and with 'greens' of puzzolana concrete, covered with sand to give the ball some stop. The so-called fairways were no more than 20 yards wide stone walls, in some cases 150 feet high, on both sides. The ball could either ricochet from one side to another or become lodged in the battlements. At least this form of golf satisfied the voracious appetite for golf of the servicemen stationed on the island. Some photographs of this unique course still survive and are on the wall of the club house. Golf was also apparently played at the Mosta garrisons but no record of this 'course' exist. At the time the then Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Albert Ernest Alfred, third son of Queen Victoria, also served in Malta and became one of the founder members of the club. Hence the royal patronage from where the club gets its name. The circle of golf clubs in the Commonwealth with Royal status is an exclusive one, with just 61 members. The relationship between golf and the British monarchy started in 1833 when King William IV bestowed the appellation upon Scotland‚Äôs Royal Perth Golfing Society. The king was also a patron of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, which he crowned one year later. Since then clubs in 12 countries have been honoured. The club moved to its present location in 1904. With limited land available it only had 14 holes and the area had to be shared with tennis players and cricketers. The course was extended to 18 holes in the 1950s but a horse-racing track crossed seven of the holes and the horses obviously had priority! The track was annexed to the golf course in the late 1980s and the course is now fully self-contained. The designer of the course is not known but all credit to him for producing a gem out of a relatively small parcel of land. The first known professional to be associated with the Malta course was F. Dalton, who was appointed in 1909, but the length of his stay is not known; it seems that none of the several appointees stayed for long. The most renowned pro was David Llewellyn who was there between 1978 and 1981; he was a confirmed 'islander' for he had first learned his golf in Singapore, then on Hayling Island before becoming a professional. He was Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year in 1971 and his greatest feat after leaving Malta was to win, with Ian Woosnam, the World title for Wales in 1987. After one hundred years of existence the Club decided to upgrade the overall standard of the course. The investment was considered huge and the project was based on a duration of 4-5 years. The first part of the project started in early 1988 when the Club brought in consultants from the United Kingdom to re- do the 18 greens. The first project was considered a total success and boosted morale to continue further with the planned project. There was a six-month suspension of this project when 70% of the golf course was completely destroyed after heavy floods in late 1988, which also caused a disruption to the festivities commemorating the Centenary of the Club. Despite this huge setback, works started again in May 1989 and have continued since. To date the course has been totally upgraded with the fairways planted with Bermuda grass, the installation of a computerised wall-to-wall watering system, the refurbishment of the sand bunkers (some 50 in total) as designed by David Llewellyn and the re-planting of the tees with TifSport certified Bermuda grass and the greens with state-of-the-art TifEagle certified Bermuda grass. Coupled with significant investment in course maintenance machinery, and the engagement of an experienced green keeping staff, these improvements ensure that Royal Malta Golf Club offers a superior golfing experience in the southern Mediterranean.

It is carried as a compliance tool and defensive weapon by law-enforcement officers, correctional staff, security guards and military personnel. A baton or truncheon may be used in many ways as a weapon. It can be used defensively to block; offensively to strike, jab, or bludgeon; and it can aid in the application of armlocks. The usual striking or bludgeoning action is not produced by a simple and direct hit, as with an ordinary blunt object, but rather by bringing the arm down sharply while allowing the truncheon to pivot nearly freely forward and downward, so moving its tip much faster than its handle. Batons are also used for non-weapon purposes such as breaking windows to free individuals trapped in a vehicle, or turning out a suspect's pockets during a search (as a precaution against sharp objects). Some criminals use batons as weapons because of their simple construction and easy concealment. The use or carrying of batons or improvised clubs by people other than law enforcement officers is restricted by law in many countries. Terminology Other names for a baton are a truncheon, cosh, billystick, billy club, nightstick, or stick. Baton comes from French word b√¢ton (stick) which comes from old French Baston and Latin bastum https://www.etymonline.com/word/baton  History  Early 20th century police truncheons in the Edinburgh Police Centre Museum A modern wooden baton In the Victorian era, police in London carried truncheons about one foot long called billy clubs. According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, this name is first recorded in 1848 as slang for a burglars' crowbar. The meaning \\"policeman's club\\" is first recorded 1856. The truncheon acted as the policeman's 'Warrant Card' as the Royal Crest attached to it indicated the policeman's authority. This was always removed when the equipment left official service (often with the person who used it). Earlier on the word was used in vulgar Latin (bastŒø‚Äîa stick helping walking, from basta‚Äîhold). The Victorian original has since developed into the several varieties available today. The typical truncheon is a straight stick made from wood or a synthetic material, approximately in diameter and long, with a fluted handle to aid in gripping. Truncheons are often ornamented with their organizations' coats of arms. Longer truncheons are called \\"riot batons\\" because of their use in riot control. Truncheons probably developed as a marriage between the club or military mace and the staff of office/sceptre. Straight batons of rubber have a softer impact. Some of the kinetic energy bends and compresses the rubber and bounces off when the object is struck. Rubber batons are not very effective when used on the subject's arms or legs, and can still cause injury if the head is struck. That is why most police departments have stopped issuing them. The Russian police standard-issue baton is rubber, except in places such as Siberia, where it can be cold enough that the rubber may become brittle and break if struck. The traffic baton is red to make it more visible as a signaling aid in directing traffic. In Russia traffic batons are striped in black and white for the same reason, and in Sweden they are white. Until the mid-1990s, British police officers carried traditional wooden truncheons of a sort that had changed little from Victorian times. Since the late 1990s, the collapsible baton is issued except for public order duties, where a fixed, acrylic baton is used. Side-handled batons were issued for a while, but fell out of favour. In New York, the police used to use two kinds of batons depending on the time. The one for daytime was called a day-stick and was in length. Another baton, that was used at night, was long and called a night-stick, which is the origin of the word \\"nightstick\\". The night-stick was longer so it could provide extra protection which was thought to be necessary at night. Target areas In modern police training, the primary targets are large nerve clusters, such as the common peroneal nerve in the mid-thigh and large, easily targetable muscle groups, such as the quadriceps and biceps. The baton is swung in fast, \\"snapping\\" strikes to these areas, sometimes only making contact with the tip. Taken together, these are intended to impair the subject's ability to continue advancing (by striking the leg) or attack (by striking the arm) by causing transitory neurapraxia (temporary muscle pain, spasm and paralysis due to nerve injury). Modern systems strictly prohibit hitting the skull, sternum, spine, or groin unless such an attack is conducted in defense of life, with many jurisdictions considering this deadly force. Before the 1970s, a common use of the police baton was to strike a suspect's head with a full-force overhand motion in order to stun them or knock them unconscious by cerebral concussion, similar to the pre-baton practice of buffaloing with the handle of a revolver. However, this practice had two major liabilities. First, there was a high risk and incidence of death or permanent injury, as the difference in force between that required to concuss a suspect into non-resistance and that which would fracture their skull tends to be narrow and unpredictable. Second, there were problems with reliability, as resistance to cerebral concussion varies widely between individuals, and head strikes that did not disable the suspect were found to merely escalate the encounter. Officer Arthur Lamb, a well-known trainer on the baton, once stated: As a result, civil lawsuits and claims of police brutality resulted in revised training for officers. Comparison with other law enforcement weapons Hand-held impact weapons have some advantages over newer less-lethal weapons. Batons are less expensive than Tasers to buy or to use, and carry none of the risk of cross-contamination of OC aerosol canisters such as pepper spray in confined areas (in houses, if police use pepper spray, the officers may get the spray in their eyes accidentally). Tasers and OC canisters have limited ammunition, whereas batons use none. Like Tasers and pepper spray, batons are referred to as \\"less-lethal\\" rather than \\"non-lethal\\". That is, these weapons are not designed to be fatal, but they can be. The baton is considered to have a greater risk of lethality than most less-lethal weapons, and so is higher on the use of force continuum than Tasers or OC. While all police weapons can potentially be taken from an officer and used against them, this risk is even greater with batons, as they can be grabbed and pulled away by a suspect if the officer improperly brandishes or swings them. Designs Batons in common use by police around the world include many different designs, such as fixed-length straight batons, blackjacks, fixed-length side-handle batons, collapsible straight batons, and other more exotic variations. All types have their advantages and disadvantages. The design and popularity of specific types of baton have evolved over the years and are influenced by a variety of factors. These include inherent compromises in the dual (and competing) goals of control effectiveness and safety (for both officer and subject). =Straightstick= Los Angeles Police Department riot officers with straightsticks during a protest A straight, fixed-length baton (also commonly referred to as a \\"straightstick\\") is the oldest and simplest police baton design, known as far back as ancient Egypt. It consists of little more than a long cylinder with a molded, turned or wrapped grip, usually with a slightly thicker or tapering shaft and rounded tip. They are often made of hardwood, but in modern times are available in other materials such as aluminium, acrylic, and dense plastics and rubber. They range in size from short clubs less than in length to \\"riot batons\\" commonly used in civil disturbances or by officers mounted on horseback. Straightsticks tend to be heavier and have more weight concentrated in the striking end than other designs. This makes them less maneuverable, but theoretically would deliver more kinetic energy on impact. Most agencies have replaced the straightstick with other batons because of inconvenience to carry, and a desire for their officers to look less threatening to the community they serve. Despite having been replaced by side-handle and expandable batons in many (if not most) law enforcement agencies, straightsticks remain in use by many major departments in the US, such as the Baltimore, Denver, Sacramento, Long Beach, Santa Ana, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Riverside Police Departments. They also are used by NYPD Auxiliary Police officers, as well as many Military Police forces around the world. =Side-handle baton= A pair of tonfa German intervention forces. Side-handle batons (sometimes referred to as T-batons) are batons with a short side handle at a right angle to the shaft, about from one end. The main shaft is typically in length. They are derived from the tonfa, an Okinawan kobud≈ç weapon, and are used with a similar technique (although tonfa are usually used in pairs, whereas side-handle batons are not). The best-known example is the Monadnock PR-24; \\"PR-24\\" has become a genericized trademark within the law enforcement and security communities for this type of product. It can be held by: * One end, and the intersection between the shaft and the handle used to catch a long swung blunt or sharp weapon. * The side handle, and the long shaft held against the hand and forearm to splint and shield the arm against an expected blow from an attacker. Side-handle batons are made in both fixed and collapsible models and may be constructed from a range of materials including wood, poly-carbonate, epoxy, aluminium, or a combination of materials. Some side-handle batons are one-piece design; the side-handle component and primary shaft are permanently fused together during manufacturing. One-piece designs are potentially stronger than two-piece designs, and have no risk of having a locking screw loosen from its threads. Other side-handle batons are two-piece in design (common among cheaper makes); the side-handle component is screwed into the primary shaft. The side handle may be removed from the shaft by the end-user, converting the side-handle into a straight baton. The advantages of a side-handle baton over a straight baton are numerous: * There is a far greater number of defensive techniques/maneuvers that may be used with the side-handle baton in contrast with the straight baton. * The side-handle component may aid in weapon retention, making it more difficult for a suspect to take the baton away from the officer in a struggle. * The side-handle component prevents the baton from rolling far away if inadvertently dropped, unlike a straight baton. * Subjectively, some officers may be able to deliver a strike of greater power with the side-handle baton (when used in conjunction with a \\"power stroke\\") over a straight baton. * Due to its design, a side handle baton is generally used in a more defensive and less offensive manner than a straight baton, and thus it is less likely for an officer to \\"instinctively\\" use a side-handle baton as a simple bludgeon and direct indiscriminate strikes against a suspect. Also, the typically defensive stance the side-handle baton is used with is generally believed to present a more community-friendly image than a straight baton. Side-handle batons have a few disadvantages: * More training is required for an officer to fully utilize the potential of a side-handle baton compared to a straight baton. Its use is not as instinctive as the straight batons. * The side-handle slightly increases overall weight and bulk of the baton compared to a straight baton of identical length. * When the side-handle baton is used as a simple bludgeon (without gripping the side- handle), it is less effective than a straight baton. Also, if an officer uses it incorrectly and strikes the subject with the end of the side handle while holding the baton from the other end it can cause serious injury (especially if the end of the handle is a large ball). Side-handle batons have been involved in high-profile incidents of alleged police brutality, such as in New Zealand's 1981 Springbok Tour and the Rodney King beating. =Expandable baton= ASP expandable baton in expanded and collapsed state Swedish riot police with expandable baton. An expandable baton (also referred to variously as a collapsible baton, telescopic [or telescoping] baton, tactical baton, spring cosh, ASP, Extendable, or extendo [slang]) is typically composed of a cylindrical outer shaft containing telescoping inner shafts (typically 2 or 3, depending on the design) that lock into each other when expanded. The shafts are usually made of steel, but lightweight baton models may have their shafts made from other materials such as aluminium alloy. Expandable batons may have a solid tip at the outer end of the innermost shaft; the purpose of the solid tip is to maximize the power of a strike when the baton is used as an impact weapon. Expandable batons are made in both straight and side-handle configurations, but are considerably more common in the straight configuration. The best-known example of the straight expandable baton is the ASP Baton, from Armament Systems and Procedures. Depending on the holster or scabbard design, it may be possible to carry an expandable baton in either collapsed or expanded position, which would be helpful if an officer needed to holster an expanded baton and it was not possible or convenient to collapse it at the time. An expandable baton is opened by being swung in a forceful manner while collapsed, using inertia to extend and lock the segments by friction. Some mechanical-lock versions can also be opened by simply pulling the segments apart. Depending on the design, expandable batons may be collapsed either by being brought down (inverted) on a hard surface, or by depressing a button lock and manually collapsing the shafts. Additionally, the baton, in collapsed configuration, may be used as a control device against non-compliant subjects in conjunction with pain-compliance control techniques, such as to remove a driver refusing to exit his or her vehicle. It can be used as a large kubotan. The expandable baton is provided to most officers in the British police forces, the idea being that should violence suddenly escalate, the baton can be easily deployed but can be stowed neatly away so as not to affect movement due to its mounting point on the officer's clothing. It is also commonly used in the UK and many other countries as a means of gaining entry quickly to a vehicle that contains offenders. In such a situation the baton is deployed and, due to the solid end of the device, is used to strike the side windows or windscreen of the vehicle to either gain entry or to stop the driver seeing where they are going in circumstances where the officer has hit the screen while the vehicle is still in motion.  Advantages  The advantages of a collapsible baton over a fixed baton are numerous: * The collapsible shaft makes it easier for the officer to carry it and to sit in a car seat wearing it, since when collapsed it is between long. This is contrasted with non-collapsible batons, which the officer may, as a measure of convenience, often resort to removing from his or her belt when seating themselves in a vehicle. This often results in leaving the baton behind when an officer is exiting the vehicle, and not readily expecting trouble. * Non- collapsible batons are typically carried in a ring-type belt attachment. Fixed batons carried in such holders may easily fall out of the holder when the officer wearing the baton sprints. Neither holding the baton down in the ring with a hand, nor holding the baton in the hand is a good solution. The typical collapsible straight baton and its scabbard do not suffer this, and remain secure regardless of the wearing officer's movement. * In theory, the mere display of extending the baton may in some instances be terrifying to an aggressive person (due to both the sight and sound of the action, with a similar intimidation technique as used with pump-action shotguns), and may thus de-escalate the situation through fear-motivated submission of the target without physical violence. * A collapsible baton may be deployed against a suspect whether expanded or collapsed; expanded, the baton's reach is extended, but collapsed, the baton is handier in close quarters. This provides greater versatility in a wider range of environments over the fixed-length baton. * A collapsible baton is essentially a heavy steel rod with usually a slightly wider tip, that concentrates the force of a blow more effectively and to a smaller area than a polycarbonate baton. This results in a strike that impacts harder to the muscle and causes deeper pain, removing the need for several strikes when targeting large muscle groups. In a life-and-death situation, the baton can be used against the bony parts of a subject with serious results. Disadvantages Expandable batons have some disadvantages: * Some police may prefer to carry a fixed baton due to the greater intimidation it may provide. Similarly, a fixed baton serves better as a conspicuous symbol of authority (i.e., \\"badge of office\\") than a collapsed expandable baton. * Fixed batons may often be less expensive than their collapsible counterparts of identical or similar quality. Because of this, some law enforcement departments, such as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, may issue a fixed-length baton, but have their officers/deputies purchase expandable batons at the option and expense of the individual officer. * Fixed batons may be inherently faster to bring into action, due to the fact that they do not need to be extended before usage as an impact weapon (unless one wishes to use a collapsible baton in collapsed form). It is, however, possible to deliver a strike whilst opening the baton in one fluid motion if the officer is correctly trained. This is called a \\"rapid response strike\\". * If an expandable baton is of friction-lock design, as most are, there is an inherent risk that the baton may inadvertently close at an inopportune moment while being used to strike a suspect. This also prevents expandable batons from being used to prod or thrust. * In a situation in which stealth is required, a collapsed baton may rattle, revealing the officer's position. * Most expandable batons have most of their weight concentrated at the grip and the tip tends to be the lightest part since it is the thinnest part of the baton. As such it may deliver less forceful blows than a fixed baton. =Similar impact weapons= Blackjacks and saps Bedford Museum The terms blackjack, cosh, and sap refer to any of several short, easily concealed club weapons consisting of a dense (often lead) weight attached to the end of a short shaft, used as a bludgeon. These weapons work by transferring kinetic energy to the dense core, via the handle, during the swing. When directed at the head, it works by concussing the brain without cutting the scalp. This is meant to stun or knock out the subject, although head strikes have a high risk of causing a permanent, disabling brain injury or being fatal. The terminology used to refer to these weapons varies and can be imprecise, and depends on the source and time period. In some contexts, these terms are used loosely to refer to any small, dense bludgeon, including those that are improvised. A late 19th-century type is a wooden shaft about one foot long, with a leather- or macram√©-covered lead ball as the head. This weapon is referred to by some sources as a \\"sap\\" (derived from \\"sapling\\" due to its wood handle), or euphemistically as a \\"life-preserver.\\" The term \\"cosh\\" may also originate with this weapon, being derived from the Romani word ka≈°t, meaning \\"stick\\" or \\"piece of wood.\\" The term \\"blackjack\\" referring to a hand weapon is of unknown etymology, and the earliest text reference is 1889. A type used by sailors in the 19th and early 20th century was weighted with a heavy lead ball at one or both ends of a piece of baleen, which is then wrapped in woven or plaited marline or codline and then varnished over.Nautical Antiques. frayedknotarts.com Some carefully made examples were likely to have been used by a boatswain or ship's master-at-arms or ship's mate as a badge of office and discipline-enforcer, so some modern sources call this weapon a \\"bosun's cosh.\\" The term \\"blackjack\\" is sometimes applied by early 20th-century maritime sources to a lead weight knotted or woven into the end of a short piece of rope that serves as a handle, though most sources would consider this weapon a type of slungshot. In the 20th century, newer designs emerged that were shorter and predominately made of stitched or braided leather, with a flexible spring inside the handle. The slight flexibility and resilience of the handle gave these small clubs a whip-like action. Law enforcement sources from the mid-20th century preferred to divide these into two categories: \\"Blackjacks\\", which have a mostly cylindrical striking head, and \\"saps\\" which have a flat, usually oval-shaped head. In common usage, these terms have become interchangeable, so a \\"sap\\" of this kind is sometimes more precisely called a flat sap, slap jack or beavertail sap to differentiate it. The sap's flat profile makes it easier to carry in a pocket and spreads its impact out over a broader area, making it less likely to break bone. However, it can also be used to strike with the edge for more focused impact, though this was discouraged by most police departments for precisely this reason. There are several variants of these weapons that use different materials, such as steel instead of lead for the weight, or plastic for the covering. Some variants use powdered metal or even sand for the weight inside the head, usually called a \\"soft sap,\\" which reduces the likelihood of bone fractures. Blackjacks and saps were popular among law enforcement for a time due to their low profile, small size, and usability at very close range, such as when grappling with a suspect. Besides the head, they were also used on the elbows, wrists, shins, collarbone, and groin. The flat sap, in particular, could be used to strike large muscle groups with the edge. In the early days of use, they were favored for their ability to stun or knock a suspect unconscious with a blow to the head. By the late 1960s head-strikes with impact weapons in general were strongly discouraged by most police departments and trainers because of the risk of death or permanent injury, as well as its questionable effectiveness. By the 1990s virtually all modern police departments had phased them out from their issued equipment, and most banned their use entirely. Stun baton Stun batons are an unusual modern variation designed to administer an electric shock in order to incapacitate the target. They consist of an insulated handle and guard, and a rigid shaft usually a foot or more in length for delivering a shock. Many designs function like an elongated stun gun or a cattle prod, requiring the tip to be held against the target and then manually triggering a shock by a switch in the handle. Some more sophisticated designs carry a charge along the shaft's entire surface, administering a shock on contact. This later design is especially useful in preventing the officer from having their weapon grabbed and taken away by an assailant. Most batons of this design were not intended to be used as impact weapons and will break if used in this way, though a few were built to withstand occasional lighter impacts. They are rarely issued to patrol officers in modern times due to their price and the other associated problems with electroshock weapons. Jitte The jitte was a Japanese Edo period police weapon consisting of a round or octagonal metal rod about long with a hook-like guard above the handle. It was used in a similar manner to modern police batons and it continued to be issued in Japan to some police departments until the early 20th century. The jitte eventually inspired an early form of expandable baton called a tokushu keibo in the 1960s. =Improvised impact weapons= Some non-purpose-built items have been used by law enforcement over the centuries as impact weapons. Examples are: * Pickaxe handles. These have been used in the British Army as an official guard baton and were issued to recruits when on guard duty who had not been trained in rifle use. * Baseball bat Flashlights D cell flashlight Although the Kel-Lite in the 1970s appears to have been the third flashlight designed specifically to be useful as an emergency defensive weapon, the best-known example is the large, metal D-cell Maglite, still in use by some law enforcement and security personnel. Use of such flashlights as a club or baton is generally officially discouraged by the manufacturers and law enforcement officials, but its use is an option. As with all police weapons, there have been many examples of misuse, such as in the Malice Green beating in Detroit. The use of flashlights as improvised impact weapons is subject to the same use of force regulations as the use of purpose-designed impact weapons like batons. Police officers may often choose to use such flashlights because they are viewed primarily as illumination devices; thus, if a police officer carries one in their hands during nighttime encounters with potentially violent subjects, it would be less likely to escalate the situation (by making the subject feel threatened) than if the officer were to be equipped with a baton or pepper spray canister instead. This permits the officer to appear less threatening while having an impact weapon in hand and ready for instantaneous action, should the situation indeed turn violent. Characteristic of a flashlight used as a baton or club is the grip employed. Flashlights are commonly held with the bulb end pointing from the thumb side of the hand, such that it is pointing outward from the body when held palm upward. When wielded as a club, the bulb end points inward when the hand is palm upward, and the grip is closely choked to the bulb end. Another advantage to using a flashlight as a club is that in poorly lit situations it can be used to initially dazzle the eyes of an opponent. Law enforcement officers often deliberately shine flashlight beams into the eyes of suspects at night to cause temporary night-blindness as a preemptive defensive measure, whether or not the individual is likely to behave violently. The weight of a flashlight makes it a clumsy baton, unable to be swung swiftly. Legality Batons are legal for sworn law enforcement and military in most countries around the world. However, the legality of civilian carry for purpose-built batons varies greatly by country, and by local jurisdictions. =Brazil= There are no restrictions about batons to the general public, but private security guards can only carry wooden or rubber batons (no length is specified) according to Law 7102/83. They may also carry electric shock batons if they have a Less- Lethal Certification course. There is a general belief in Brazil that rubber batons are less prone to break bones than the wooden ones. =Canada= There is no law that prohibits batons; except for spring-loaded batons, which are defined as a prohibited weapon under a regulation entitled \\"Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted\\" (also capable of being referred to by its registration number: SOR 98‚Äì462). However, it is a crime under section 90 of the Criminal Code to carry any weapon, including a baton, in a concealed fashion. =Hong Kong= According to Cap 217 (Weapons Ordinance), Laws of Hong Kong, any person who has possession of any prohibited items commits an offence, which includes expandable batons. =Republic of Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland, telescopic truncheons are classified as illegal offensive weapons. =Sweden= All types of batons can be owned but not carried in public spaces by private citizens according to law (1988:254). =United Kingdom= Straight, side-handled (PR-24) and friction-lock batons were added to the list of offensive weapons in 2004 (except Scotland, where they were added in 2005), which prohibited their manufacture, sale, hire, offering for sale or hire, lending or giving to any other person under Section 141 Criminal Justice Act 1988. The telescopic truncheon ‚Äì defined as being a truncheon which extends automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to its handle ‚Äì was banned in the original 1988 order. Section 46 of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019, passed in May 2019, prohibits possession even in a private dwelling (e.g. home, closed off building site, behind a sales counter, etc.); previously, possession in private was permitted after meeting certain conditions based on ownership. However, this section appears to be not yet in force . =India= In India, police often carry a large stick called a lathi ( , that is used during riot controlling or used when a person is arrested or for self or public defence. =United States= Legality is determined by the laws of the individual states. Some, such as Vermont or Arizona, allow for legal carry in the absence of unlawful behavior or criminal intent. Others previously prohibited possession but constitutional challenges have overturned the bans, e.g. Connecticut v. DeCiccio (2009).Volokh, Eugene. \\"Second Amendment protects dirk knives and police batons\\". Washington Post. And others, such as California, have general prohibitions against the carrying of all \\"club\\" weapons by non- law enforcement; constitutional challenges to California's law have failed. Such jurisdictions will sometimes make exceptions for persons employed as security guards or bodyguards, will provide for permits to be obtained for legal carry, or make exceptions for persons who complete an appropriate training course.

She married the British fur trader John Johnston, a \\"wintering partner\\" of the North West Company. They had prominent roles in the crossroads society of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and the territory before 1830, and entertained notable visitors from a variety of disciplines. Their daughter Jane Johnston Schoolcraft has become recognized as the first Native American literary writer in the United States. Life She was born as Ozhaguscodaywayquay (Green Prairie Woman) into an Ojibwe (also known as Ojibwa) family in Chequameqon, near present-day La Pointe, Wisconsin and Chequamegon Bay; her father was the famous war chief Waubojeeg (The White Fisher). Michael Witgen. An Infinity of Nations: How the Native New World Shape Early America. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011, p. 11. Waubojeeg had been a war leader when younger, and he became civil chief as an elder in his community at Chequamegon. Ozhaguscodaywayquay later related to Anna Brownell Jameson in 1836 the story of her \\"vision quest\\" that she had when she was a teenager.White, Bruce. \\"'The Woman Who Married a Beaver': Trade Patterns and Gender Roles in the Ojibwa Fur Trade\\". Ethnohistory, vol. 46, no. 1 (Winter 1999): 109-147. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Ozhaguscodaywayquay told her when she was 13, she embarked on her \\"vision quest\\" to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Ozhaguscodaywayquay's \\"vision quest\\": > \\"She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in > his hand, saying \\"Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you > fast? Here is food for you!\\" He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked > up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which > was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of > Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, she felt as if she > was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, > she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, \\"All my relations will be > burned!\\", but a voice answered and said, \\"No, they will not be destroyed, > they will be saved!\\", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was > not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother > brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a > guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned > to her father's lodge\\". Jameson also noted that Ozhaguscodaywayquay was considered to be a strong woman as \\"in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe\\", which was an accomplishment for a woman as for the Ojibwe, hunting was usually a masculine form of activity. In 1790, Scots-Irish fur trader John Johnston traveled to Mackinac Island and then to Chequamegon by canoe, where he asked Waubjoeeg for permission to marry his youngest daughter, Ozhaguscodaywayquay. Waubojeeg was cautious, as he had seen other white traders later abandon their native wives, and told Johnston to return to Montreal, and if he returned to Chequamegon in the spring, Waubojeeg would consider his proposal. Johnston returned and Waubojeeg agreed to the marriage. Ozhaguscodaywayquay married John Johnston in 1793. However, it appears she was not consulted, as after the marriage she ran off to her grandfather, however her father found her, beat her with a stick, threatened to cut off her ear, and returned her to Johnston. Waubojeeg's motives for his actions are unclear as neither compelled marriage nor violence enforcing it appear typical of Ojibwe marriages or Ojibwe fur-trade marriages. Ojibwe marriages could be dissolved at will by either partner by simply walking out, and Ozhaguscodaywayquay seemed to have been troubled by the implication of a marriage \\"till death\\", which was the norm with Europeans at the time (British divorce laws were not liberalized until 1967-until then, divorce was very difficult to obtain in Britain and throughout the British Empire). After the marriage, she was baptized as Susan. Despite this rough start to their marriage, by many accounts their marriage grew into a happy one. Ozhaguscodaywayquay ultimately decided that Johnston was the kindly white man she had seen in her \\"vision quest\\" when she was 13, and it was her destiny to marry him. Later in 1793 they moved east, settling at Sault Ste. Marie in present-day Michigan where they built a log-home that was the largest in the region. The settlement of Sault Ste. Marie extended on both sides of the river and was then considered part of Canada. The community was made up mostly of Ojibwa, Ottawa and M√©tis peoples, centered on a trading post of the British- founded North West Company, whose headquarter was in Montreal. A mixture of European immigrants also worked there. It became a center of European, United States, and Native American politics and trade in the area.Robert E. Bieder. \\"Sault Ste. Marie and the War of 1812: A World Turned Upside Down in the Old Northwest\\". Indiana Magazine of History, XCV (March 1999): 1-13. Johnston was a \\"wintering partner\\" of the North West Company; one of the men who traded directly with the trappers, who were usually of Native American descent. He was a man of substance, having arrived in Canada with capital to invest in the business. He and his wife were influential in the trade and relations among the Ojibwe, Canadians, Europeans and Americans in the area. They received as hosts many explorers, politicians of both Canada and the U.S., scholars, Native chiefs, and military officers. They were considered among the ruling class in both the Native and European communities. Johnston owed much of his success to Ozhaguscodwaywayquay's talents, influence, and connections as the member of an important Ojibwe family. Ozhaguscodaywayquay taught him and their eight children the language and ways of the Ojibwe. While she learned to understand English, she only spoke Ojibwe. John taught them to speak, read, and write English, and had a large library from which some of the children particularly drew. Their eldest daughter Jane Johnston married the American ethnographer Henry Rowe Schoolcraft in 1823. Assigned to the community as the U.S. Indian agent in 1822, he became noted for his work on the Ojibwe, aided by Jane's access and her knowledge of the Ojibwe language and culture. Jane Johnston has been recognized as the first Native American literary writer and poet in the United States. In 2008, she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame. Two other Johnston daughters also married prominent white men of the region; one married Henry R. Schoolcraft's younger brother, James. George Johnston assisted Schoolcraft as a U.S. Indian agent. The youngest son, John McDougall Johnston, served as the last official Indian Agent in the area.Mary M. June. \\"British Period - Sault Ste. Marie Timeline and History\\" , Bayliss Public Library, 2000. Accessed December 13, 2008. Later life Under the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812, the U.S. no longer allowed British traders and trappers to move freely across the border between the U.S. and the British colony of Upper Canada. John Johnston's fur trade business never recovered. The family suffered divisions after the War of 1812. John served as a captain with the British and was part of the British and native forces that surprised that Americans took Mackinac Island in 1812. After the War of 1812, Johnston retained his status as a British subject, even though he continued to live with his family in the United States. From 1814 to 1816 he served as a British civil magistrate and justice of the peace for the Indian territories. He never became an American citizen, and participated in the fur trade through his son's American citizenship, since they were born within American borders. Lewis, the oldest son, had served with the Royal Navy against the U.S. Taken prisoner during the war, he suffered poor treatment by US forces and rejected living under U.S. rule. After his release, he moved to Upper Canada. Ozhaguscodaywayquay's political influence grew after the War of 1812, as demonstrated by the story of she and her son, George, dissuaded Ojibwe leaders from attacking the treaty delegation led by Michigan Territory Governor Lewis Cass in 1820. Susan Johnston was widowed in 1828. After her husband's death, she managed the family fur trading business. She also established a sugaring and fishing business, which she operated with the help of her children for several years. She was known as a physically active woman who caught and preserved local whitefish, regularly paddled her canoe across the broad St. Marys River (Michigan‚ÄìOntario), and annually spent time in the woods making large quantities of maple sugar, sometimes returning with as much as two tons. She also began to take an active role in the Presbyterian Church (USA) . Throughout her life, she played integral roles in her family and community as a business woman and leader.

From 1998 until his death in 2020, he was president of Agudath Israel of America, a Haredi advocacy organization. He was also head of that organization's Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages). He was one of the most respected leaders of the American Orthodox Jewish community, known for his scholarly and oratorical skills. Early life and education Yaakov Perlow was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Rabbi Nochum Mordechai Perlow (1887‚Äì1976), the Novominsker Rebbe, and his wife, Beila Rochma Morgenstern. He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, the Shufra D'Yaakov, founder of the Novominsk Hasidic dynasty. His maternal grandfather was Rabbi Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern, the Sokolover Rebbe, a direct descendant of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. Morgenstern was one of the main founders of Agudath Israel in Poland. Perlow began his Torah education at Yeshiva Toras Chaim in East New York, Brooklyn, and continued on to the Lithuanian-type Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn. He also graduated with honors from Brooklyn College.  Career  After his marriage, Perlow taught at Hebrew Theological College in Skokie, Illinois. He later moved back to Brooklyn and settled in Crown Heights, becoming a member of the administration of the mesivta of Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin. In 1969, he was appointed rosh yeshiva at the Breuer's yeshiva, Yeshiva Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, in Washington Heights, New York, a position he held for 11 years. He also served as the Rav of Congregation Bais Yosef in that city. After the death of his father on September 4, 1976, Perlow began serving as Novominsker Rebbe. In 1980, he established the Novominsk Hasidic Center and founded his own yeshiva, Yeshivas Novominsk Kol Yehuda, named in memory of his uncle, Rabbi Yehuda Aryeh Perlow of Novominsk- Williamsburg, in Borough Park, Brooklyn. =Agudath Israel of America= Perlow became an active member of Agudath Israel of America from 1975, when he was one of the main speakers at the 7th Siyum HaShas in New York. He became a leader of the Torah Umesorah organization as well. In December 1998, Perlow was named president of Agudath Israel of America, succeeding Rabbi Moshe Sherer, who had died seven months earlier. With his appointment, the presidential and leadership duties held by Sherer were divided between Perlow, the new president, and a three-man executive. Perlow was also head of the organization's Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Torah Sages). Perlow frequently spoke out on issues affecting the American Orthodox Jewish world, including Internet usage, child abuse, Holocaust denial, overpriced Jewish weddings, and U.S. politics. In 2015, Perlow shocked attendees at the 93rd annual Agudath Israel of America dinner by directly appealing to President Obama to reconsider the Iran deal. At the 73rd annual Agudah convention in 1995, Perlow urged dialogue with non-Orthodox Jews while at the same time \\"lashing out at what he described as the 'false ideology' of non-Orthodox Judaism.\\" In June 1999, he wrote in The Jewish Observer in support of a rapprochement in the long-standing feud between the Haredi and Reform movements. At the May 2014 Agudath dinner, he stated that the Reform and Conservative movements \\"have disintegrated themselves, become oblivious, fallen into an abyss of intermarriage and assimilation\\", and branded another movement, Open Orthodoxy, as being \\"steeped in apikorsos (heresy)\\". While New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the next speaker at the dinner, he did not challenge Perlow's remarks, which cast aspersions on the affiliations of the non-Orthodox Jewish population of New York City. Personal life Perlow's first wife, Yehudis (d. 1998), was the daughter of Grand Rabbi Avrohom Eichenstein of Zidichov-Chicago. The couple had two sons and two daughters. In 2004, Perlow remarried to Miriam Landynski, his first wife's sister and widow of Rabbi Yaakov Zev Landynski. Death In March 2020, Perlow urged American Orthodox Jews to follow social distancing and other precautionary guidelines in response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying: \\"We cannot behave the way we did last week or two weeks ago. We're told that the halakha (Jewish law) is that we must listen to doctors, whether it's about a sick person or Yom Kippur\\". He was soon after infected by COVID-19. On April 7, 2020, he died due to complications from the disease. He was 89. His funeral was held in a private ceremony. The eulogies and saying of Psalms were broadcast live over the telephone, in order to limit the spread of the virus. Bibliography In 1982, Perlow published the first of what would eventually be a seven-volume series called Adas Yaakov, with three volumes on topics in the Talmud, three volumes on the Jewish holidays, and one volume on Chumash.

Its capital was Maghas, and it controlled a vital trade route through the Darial Pass. The kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century, under the rule of king Durgulel.  History  The Alans (Alani) originated as an Iranian-speaking subdivision of the Sarmatians. They were split by the invasion of the Huns into two parts, the European and the Caucasian. The Caucasian Alans occupied part of the North Caucasian plain and the foothills of the main mountain chain from the headwaters of the Kuban River in the west to the Darial Gorge in the east.Bailey, Harold Walter. Alans. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Online Edition. Accessed on August 20, 2007. =As vassal of Khazaria= Alania was an important buffer state during the Byzantine-Arab Wars and Khazar-Arab Wars of the 8th century. Theophanes the Confessor left a detailed account of Leo the Isaurian's mission to Alania in the early 8th century. Leo was instructed by Emperor Justinian II to bribe the Alan leader Itaxes into severing his \\"ancient friendship\\" with the Kingdom of Abkhazia which had allied itself with Caliph Al-Walid I He crossed the mountain passes and concluded an alliance with the Alans, but was prevented from returning to Byzantium through Abasgia. Although the Abkhazians spared no expense to have him imprisoned, the Alans refused to convey the Byzantine envoy to his enemies. After several months of adventures in the Northern Caucasus, Leo extricated himself from the precarious situation and returned to Constantinople. After Leo assumed the imperial title, the land of his mountaineer allies was invaded by Umar II's forces. A Khazar chieftain, Barjik, hastened to their succor and, in 722, the joint Alan-Khazar army inflicted a defeat on the Arab general Tabit al-Nahrani. The Khazars erected Skhimar and several other strongholds in Alania at this period. In 728 Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik, having penetrated the Gate of the Alans, devastated the country of the Alans. Eight years later, Marwan ibn Muhammad passed by the Gate in order to ravage the forts in Alania. In 758, as Ibn al-Faqih reports, the Gate was held by another Arab general, Yazid ibn Usayd. As a result of their united stand against the successive waves of invaders from the south, the Alans of the Caucasus fell under the overlordship of the Khazar Khaganate. They remained staunch allies of the Khazars in the 9th century, supporting them against a Byzantine-led coalition during the reign of the Khazar king Benjamin. According to the anonymous author of the Schechter Letter, many Alans were during this period adherents of Judaism. =Independence and Christianization= Surviving architectural monuments of the Alanian kingdom include three churches in Arkhyz, the Shoana Church, and the Senty Church.central Zelenchuk church In the late 9th century, Alania became independent from the Khazars. In the early 10th century, the Alans fell under the influence of the Byzantine Empire due to King Constantine III of Abkhazia's activities in north Caucasus, the latter sent an army into Alan territory and, with the Byzantine patriarch Nicholas Mystikos, converted the Alans to Christianity. The conversion is documented in the letters of Patriarch Nicholas Mysticus to the local archbishop, Peter, who was appointed here through King George II of Abkhazia's efforts. When Ibn Rustah visited Alania at some point between 903 and 913, its king was by then Christian. The Persian traveller came to Alania from Sarir, a Christian kingdom immediately to the east:Al-Mas'udi notes that the Alanian king married a sister of the king of Sarir. The Byzantines, who had adopted an anti-Khazar foreign policy, involved the Alans in a war against the Khaganate during the reign of the Khazar ruler Aaron II, probably the early 920s. In this war the Alans were defeated and their king captured. According to Muslim sources such as al- Mas'udi (943/56), the Alans abandoned Christianity and expelled the Byzantine missionaries and clergy roughly contemporaneously with these events. Aaron's son married the daughter of the Alan king and Alania was re-aligned with the Khazars, remaining so until the collapse of the Khaganate in the 960s. = Later history = Empress Maria of Alania, right, the wife of Michael VII and of Nicephorus III, was Alan on her mother's side. Her maternal uncle was king Dorgolel of Alania. After the downfall of Khazaria, the Alan kings frequently allied with the Byzantines and various Georgian rulers for protection against encroachments by northern steppe peoples such as the Pechenegs and Kipchaks. John Skylitzes reports that Alda of Alania, after the death of her husband, \\"George of Abasgia\\" (i.e., George I of Georgia), received Anakopia as a maritime fief from Emperor Romanus III. This happened in 1033, the year when the Alans and the Rus sacked the coast of Shirvan in modern-day Azerbaijan. Alania is not mentioned in East Slavic chronicles, but archaeology indicates that the Alans maintained trade contacts with the Rus' principality of Tmutarakan. There is a stone grave cross, with a Cyrillic inscription from 1041, standing on the bank of the Bolshoi Yegorlyk River in present-day Stavropol Krai, immediately north of Alania.Kuznetsov, X-II. Two Russian crosses, datable to ca. 1200, were discovered by archaeologists in Arkhyz, the heartland of medieval Alania.Kuznetsov, X-I. The Alans and Georgians probably collaborated in the Christianization of the Vainakhs and Dvals in the 12th and 13th centuries, Georgian missionaries were active in Alania and the Alan contingents were frequently employed by the Georgian monarchs against their Muslim neighbors. The Alanian-Georgian alliance was cemented in the 1060s, when the Alans struck across Muslim Arran and sacked Ganja. In the 1120s King David the Builder of Georgia visited the Darial to reconcile the Alans with the Kipchaks, who thereupon were allowed to pass through Alania to the Georgian soil. David's son, Demetre I, also journeyed, c. 1153, to Alania accompanied by the Arab historian Ibn al-Azraq. The alliance culminated in 1187, when the Alanian prince David Soslan married Queen Tamar of Georgia, a half-Alanian herself, with their descendants ruling Georgia until the 19th century. The medieval Alanian princesses also married Byzantine and Russian Rurikid rulers more than once. For instance, Maria the Ossetian, who founded the Convent of Princesses in Vladimir, was the wife of Vsevolod the Big Nest and grandmother of Alexander Nevsky. Political map of the Caucasus region in 1245 In the late 1230s all three Christian powers - Alania, Georgia, and Vladimir-Suzdal - fell before the Mongol invaders. Bishop Theodore of Alania described the plight of his metropolis in a lengthy epistolary sermon written during the tenure of Patriarch Germanus II (1222‚Äì40). The French-Flemish monk and traveler William of Rubruck mentions Alans numerous times in the account of his 1253‚Äì1255 journey through Eurasia to the Great Khan, e.g. Alans living as Mongol subjects in Crimea, Old Astrakhan, the Khan's capital Karakoram, and also still as freemen in their Caucasian homeland (\\"the Alans or Aas, who are Christians and still fight the Tartars\\").W.

Acc. to: http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rubruck.html. Chaps. IX and XXII. The wars of Timur in the 14th century inflicted the final blow on Alania and decimated its population. Those who survived being killed or enslaved by the Mongols and Timur's armies, broke up into three groups. One retreated into the foothills and valleys of the central Caucasus and produced the two principal Ossetian groups, Digor and Iron. Another group of Alans migrated with the Kipchaks into Eastern Europe and preserved their language and ethnic identity as the Jassic people until the 15th century. The third group joined the Mongol horde and soon disappeared from history.  Known rulers  The nomenclature used by the rulers of Alania is unknown. Where they are mentioned by historical records, they are variously called \\"lord\\", \\"prince\\", \\"king\\", \\"tsar\\", and by the Byzantines, exousiokrator. Notably, the Byzantines never referred to other foreign rulers by this title, using arkhon or exousiastes instead. = Non-dynastic/dynasty unknown = * Bazuk - c. late 1st/early 2nd century; allied with the Arsacid kings of Iberia * Anbazuk/Ambazuk - co-ruled with previous * Ashkhadar - c. early 4th century; father of Ashkhen, wife of Trdat III of Armenia * Itaz - waged war against Abkhazia in the early 8th century = Tsarazon/Ts√¶rasant√¶ dynasty = * Urdur/Urdura/Urdure - c. early 11th century; invaded Kakheti around 1029 and was killed by Kvirike III.

A leading Ossetian philologist, T.A. Guriev, was the main advocate of this idea, insisting that the Ossetians should accept the name of the Alans as their self-designation and rename North Ossetia into Alania. The term \\"Alania\\" quickly became popular in Ossetian daily life through the names of various enterprises, a TV channel, political and civic organizations, a publishing house, a soccer team, an airline company etc. In November 1994, the name of \\"Alania\\" was officially added to the republican title (Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania).Shnirelman, Victor (2006).

She was first named after Peter Stuyvesant, a Dutch politician that served as the last Dutch director-general of the colony of New Netherland from 1647 until it was ceded provisionally to the English in 1664. She was renamed and commissioned after Crux, a constellation centered on four stars in the southern sky in a bright portion of the Milky Way. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Peter Stuyvesant was laid down on 27 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1212, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; sponsored by Mrs. Frank D. Arthur, of Miami, and launched on 16 November 1943. She was transferred to the US Navy 27 November 1943, and renamed Crux. She was commissioned 17 March 1944, Commander Charles Robert Beyer, USNR, in command. Service history Departing Norfolk, Virginia, 4 May 1944, Crux arrived at Espiritu Santo 14 June. From 20 June to 10 April 1944, Crux repeatedly loaded cargo at Brisbane, Australia, for such ports as Milne Bay, Finschhafen, Langemak Bay, Port Moresby, and Hollandia in New Guinea, and Manus, Admiralty Islands. Her supply base was shifted to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, in April 1945, and from 16 April to 15 October 1945, she carried cargo from that port to Humboldt Bay, and Mios Woendi, New Guinea, and Nissan Atoll, Bismarck Archipelago. Taking homeward-bound servicemen on board at Manila Bay, Crux sailed 15 November for San Francisco, California, arriving 10 December. Decommissioning The ship was decommissioned there and returned to the Maritime Commission (MARCOM) on 31 January 1946, and entered the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Crux was stricken from the Navy list on 25 February 1946. Resuming the name Peter Stuyvesant, the ship remained in reserve into the 1960s. She was sold for scrapping to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, on 30 November 1961, for $58,689.89. She was removed from the fleet on 19 December 1961.

In public transit, this typically takes a few minutes at a trip terminal. For air travel, where layovers are longer, passengers will exit the vehicle and wait in the terminal, often to board another vehicle traveling elsewhere. Mass transit A layover for mass transit allows a short period of recovery time built into the schedule. Layovers are generally used for one or more of the following reasons: recover from delays, provide breaks for the driver, and/or allow time for a driver change. Delays may be caused by earlier traffic congestion or excess boarding times. In addition to being used at the end of vehicle trip, layovers can be scheduled at timing points during the trip, in which case they are often referred to as loading/unloading time. In this case, they serve as extra time provided for the loading and unloading of passengers, which is most often scheduled at busy stops. They also allow time to pass if a service is running early, to prevent arriving at a timing point ahead of schedule. Long-distance rail and bus A layover in long-distance travel by train or intercity bus is a break that a passenger must take between vehicles in a multi-vehicle trip. It is the time spent at a terminal after leaving one vehicle and waiting to board the next. Many inter-city and international trips include layovers. As in mass transit, a layover in long-distance travel may provide for a break taken by the operator. A vehicle is said to be laying over after it finishes its route and is waiting prior to a return trip, or is taking a break to change crews or for the crew to rest. Air In air travel, a stop or transfer (from one airplane to another) is considered to be a layover or connection up to a certain maximum allowed connecting time, while a so-called stopover is a substantially longer break in the flight itinerary. The maximum time depends on many variables, but for most U.S. and Canadian itineraries, it is 4 hours, and for most international itineraries (including any domestic stops), it is 24 hours. In general, layovers are cheaper than stopovers, because notionally layovers are incidental to traveling between two other points, whereas stopovers are among the traveler's destinations.

Pelham's many illuminating letters, especially to his half-brother John Singleton Copley, provide an important contemporary perspective of the events of the American Revolution. Pelham was born in Boston, Massachusetts, where his father, Peter Pelham, a limner, engraver, and schoolmaster, had married Mary (Singleton) Copley, widow of Richard Copley and mother of John Singleton Copley. His father died in 1751. A small tobacco shop run by his mother provided support for the family until Copley brought prosperity to them all through his portrait painting. Their home was on Lindall Street, at the present-day intersection of Exchange Place and Congress Street. From there Henry attended the Boston Latin School. He is assumed to have studied drawing and painting with his half-brother. It was a likeness of Henry Pelham, then aged fifteen or sixteen, that featured in The Boy with the Flying Squirrel, a painting that was exhibited in London in 1766 and brought Copley his first fame abroad. Pelham's 1770 engraving The Fruits of Arbitrary Power, or The Bloody Massacre, famously copied by Paul Revere Henry Pelham's letters reveal a na√Øve, boyish young man, devoted to his mother and half-brother, and an efficient assistant to the latter in practical affairs. He himself painted miniatures at this time, several of which are preserved and reveal admirable workmanship. Pelham is perhaps best known for creating a 1770 engraving titled The Fruits of Arbitrary Power, or The Bloody Massacre, which depicted the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770. He lent a copy to Paul Revere, who copied it and produced his own engraving. Because Revere's version was advertised for sale three weeks after the Massacre and a week before Pelham's version went on sale, and because it failed to credit him, Pelham felt that Revere had taken advantage of him. A much more ardent Loyalist than Copley, Pelham expressed himself vigorously against his Patriot neighbors, whom he held to be misguided and rebellious. In the winter of 1775, while making a journey on horseback to Philadelphia, a mob attacked him in Springfield, Massachusetts, as one of \\"a damn'd pack of Torys.\\" His sketch of the redoubts on Bunker Hill is reproduced with the Copley-Pelham letters.\\"Letters and Papers of John Singleton Copley and Henry Pelham\\", Mass. Hist. Soc. Colls., vol. LXXI (1914), p. 327. His Plan of Boston was engraved in aquatint in London in 1777. Pelham left Boston with other Loyalists in August 1776. Arriving in London, where the Copleys were settled, he supported himself by teaching drawing, perspective, geography, and astronomy. In 1777, he contributed to the Royal Academy The Finding of Moses, which was engraved by W. Ward in 1787.Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers, v. IV, 1904, p. 87. The following year he exhibited some enamels and miniatures. Having married Catherine Butler, daughter of William Butler of Castle Crine, County Clare, Ireland, Pelham subsequently went to Ireland. His wife, however, died while bearing twin sons, Peter and William, and Pelham returned with them to London. He and Copley shared in the estate of their mother, who died in Boston on April 29, 1789. Soon after this Pelham was named agent for Lord Lansdowne's Irish estates, a work which he followed with energy and ability. He became a civil engineer and cartographer, and his county and baronial maps are important documents of Irish history. Pelham drowned from a boat in 1806 while superintending the erection of a martello tower in the River Kenmare. Notes References *\\"Henry Pelham.\\" Dictionary of American Biography.

Biography  Active as a printmaker in Cleveland in the 1930s, Sheffield Kagy specialized in block prints of contemporary scenes. Born and raised in Cleveland, he studied with Henry Keller and Paul Travis at the Cleveland School of Art and with Ernest Fiene at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, D.C. In 1932, Kagy opened the short-lived Sheffield Studio School of Art in Cleveland, which offered basic art instruction taught by a faculty that included Kalman Kubinyi. Kagy was one of only two Cleveland artists to make prints for the Public Works of Art Project in 1934. He made several linoleum cuts and at least one lithograph for the Cleveland graphic arts project of the Works Progress Administration in 1936. Kagy was a vice president of the Cleveland Print Makers and showed his work in many local exhibitions including several May Shows (1931‚Äì41). He participated in annual print exhibitions in Chicago, Cleveland, and Dayton, and his work also appeared in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Venice, Italy. Kagy moved to Washington in 1936 and taught fine arts and printmaking at the Abbott Art School. He worked for the U.S. Treasury Department, 1937‚Äì40, and painted murals for post offices in Walterboro, South Carolina, and Luray, Virginia. Modeled on the Cleveland Print Makers, Kagy organized the Washington Print Maker's Club in 1940, whose members included Herman Maril and Prentiss Taylor. Kagy was head of the art department at Chevy Chase Junior College in Maryland, 1940‚Äì43, then served in the navy as a camouflage designer for the Bureau of Ships until 1945. After the war he became a professor of fine arts at the National Art School, a post he held until 1956. He was an exhibition officer and designer for the State Department, 1959-73.

Goodman was a distinguished professor at the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics at Wayne State University School of Medicine, editor-in-chief of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, and a member of the anthropology section of the United States National Academy of Sciences. Life and work Goodman grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and spent many years in Detroit, Michigan as the only Wayne State University faculty member appointed to the National Academy of Science until his death on November 14, 2010. After high school, he attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for one year, then in 1943 entered the Army Air Forces, where he served as a navigator for the remainder of World War II. He was married in 1946, shortly after returning to college. He became interested in science after a comparative anatomy course; the professor, Harold Wolfe, recruited him as a teaching assistant. Goodman graduated with a degree in zoology and a minor in biochemistry, and continued on at Wisconsin for his master's and Ph.D. degrees under Wolfe (a former student of Alan Boyden). Upon finishing a dissertation on the antigen- antibody precipitin reaction, he went to Caltech for post-doctoral work, supported by an NIH fellowship.Interview with Morris Goodman , July 28, 2004, conducted by Joel Hagen. From Perspectives on Molecular Evolution website, by Michael R. Dietrich. Accessed August 19, 2007. Working with Dan Campbell at Caltech (within the Division of Chemistry headed by Linus Pauling), Goodman worked on the immunological properties of hemoglobins, including the immunological differences between normal and sickle-cell hemoglobin. According to a 2004 interview, Goodman became interested in evolutionary problems around 1957‚Äì1958. After research stints at the University of Illinois Medical School and the Detroit Institute of Cancer Research, he embarked--with his friend Morris Wilson--on studies of the degree of variability in proteins expressed early vs. late in development. By 1961, Goodman's comparative immunology research produced some results, particularly on the evolutionary relationships among primates, that were attracting interest from evolutionary biologists. He presented his ideas at the New York Academy of Sciences and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. At the latter meeting, he and two others using molecular approaches to evolutionary problems (Emile Zuckerkandl and Harold Klinger) were confronted by three of the \\"framers\\" of the modern evolutionary synthesis: Ernst Mayr, G. G. Simpson, and Theodosius Dobzhansky. During the early history of molecular evolution, traditional evolutionists were both interested in and apprehensive about the advent of molecular techniques to evolutionary biology; Simpson later referred to Goodman as \\"an old friendly antagonist.\\". Through the 1960s and 1970s, Goodman continued his evolutionary work based on serology, eventually with graduate students working under him. In the 1970s he also started using protein sequence data for his molecular taxonomy work. In a 1975 paper in Nature, Goodman and his collaborators used sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hemoglobin (including possible ancestral sequences) and analyze which sites on the hemoglobin complex had evolved at which stages. Goodman called this the first \\"hard evidence of Darwinian evolution\\". In 1982, with another Nature paper, Goodman did the same for the DNA sequences of the hemoglobin genes.

In 1965, his work at the Dermatology Clinic was recognized by the US Board of Dermatology. At the same time, he worked for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Venezuela. He subsequently played a major role in founding the National Institute of Dermatology (now called the National Institute of Biomedicine) in 1972. In 1968, Convit was elected president of the International Leprosy Association (ILA) and was re-elected in 1973. In 1971, Convit was named by the WHO as Director of the Co-operative Centre for the Study and Histological Classification of Leprosy. In 1976, Convit was elected Director of the Pan American Research and Training in Leprosy and Tropical Diseases. He was also named president of the International Journal of Leprosy. In 1987, Convit added killed Mycobacterium leprae to the BCG vaccine. The combined vaccine was tested worldwide, but was not more effective than regular BCG. In 1988, the Venezuelan government nominated Convit for a Nobel Prize. A vaccine for leishmaniasis was later developed using Convit's method. He also worked on onchocerciasis, mycosis, and other tropical diseases. On June 7, 2010, a Venezuelan newspaper incorrectly announced the successful development by Convit of a new cancer vaccine intended to prevent colon, stomach and breast cancer. Venezuela's National Institute of Biomedicine soon published a note clarifying that they have been working for the previous three years on a vaccine against cancer and it is still in development. During this time they have been evaluating a small group of 23 patients, mostly breast cancer and a few of colon, stomach and brain cancers. They have been giving patients an experimental model of immunotherapy against cancer, which have had encouraging results. This vaccine is based on the idea that cancerous cells appear and propagate because the body does not detect them. A sample of the tumour mixed with formalin and BCG marks the malignant cells so the immune system might react and attack the cancer. =Death= Convit turned 100 in 2013. He died on 12 May 2014.Dr. Jacinto Convit Dies: Nobel Prize Winner Dies at 100 Described as a popular hero, he never charged a patient for the care he gave.

The line \\"In diesem Jahre haben wir zwei Sonnenfinsternissen\\" (In this year we have [seen] two solar eclipses) places the composition of the piece in or shortly after 1707, when central Germany was witness to two such celestial events. The extant source‚Äîa fair-copy autograph manuscript on three large, folded sheets‚Äîwas not discovered until 1932. The work itself is a loosely structured quodlibet for SATB and continuo. Bach likely did not write the text, which some attribute to the Leipzig poet Johann Christoph Gottsched. Though the cover sheet has been lost, the libretto of the remaining portion indicates that the quodlibet was to be performed at a wedding, possibly that of the composer himself to Maria Barbara Bach.

He spent many years teaching at St. Edward's School, Oxford. He became a member of Gorseth Kernow in 1954 under the Bardic name of Gwas Kevardhu (December's Man). During the 1970s, he led the innovative folk group Tremenysy (Travellers). His poetical work is heavily influenced by the early poetry of Wales and Brittany, and it was he who adapted the Welsh traethodl to Cornish. Another important influence is music, since a great deal of his work is song. He has won Gorseth Kernow competitions. In c.1979 he and Dr Fred Pargeter started a new Morris dancing side at St Edward's School. The side involved over a dozen boys between 14‚Äì18 years old introducing them to folk music and traditional English country dancing. The SESMM survived until for around three years in which time they notched up many quality performances both around Oxfordshire and on tour to Cornwall (1980, 1981 and 1982). Tony Snell also inspired many of the St Edward's pupils to involvement in folk music (much to the irritation of the school's irascible head of music) with a number of bands created following Tremenysy, including Five Bar Gate, Treadmill and the Brown and Bitter Band.

Proving helpful, Greece offered one million dollars to Iraq for humanitarian purposes, this may be because they do not want to take in any refugees, as it was reported that Iraqis trying to enter Greece from Turkey are most definitely likely to be sent back to Iraq. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has confirmed that a group of 135 Iraqis were arrested while preparing to cross into Greece have been sent back to Iraq. As Greece has the toughest migration policy in Europe, allowing only less than one percent of applications through. The UNHCR claims there to be 820 Iraqi refugees living in Greece. A further 1,415 have applied for asylum.1,415 Iraqi Asylum applications for Greece History In the year 2002, Greece ranked ninth among all the European Union member states in the number of Iraqis with refugee status, as the largest group of asylum applicants throughout the past five years were Iraqis. From the year 1997 to 2001, Greece had the sixth highest total of Iraqi applications in EU countries, and continuing from 2000 to 2002, applications submitted by Iraqis doubled, culminating in 45% of all applications in 2002 in Greece.Refugee Movement in Greece The number was put at 2,300 asylum applicants. In the first half of 2003, an almost identical trend emerged, whereby Iraqis were accounted for 43 per cent of all asylum seekers. However, these figures do not reflect the exact Iraqi population as there is reluctance among many Iraqis to lodge applications for asylum in Greece, hoping to retain the right to apply for asylum elsewhere in Europe. The number of Iraqis unregistered is said to be at least the same as the number who are registered, if not more, in which estimates vary from 5,000 up to 40,000 individuals. 1,415 Iraqi asylum-seekers made claims in Greece in 2006, and with the increase in Iraqis heading to Europe, the country has subsequently received a greater number of applications in the first half of 2007 than for the whole of the previous year. Greece‚Äôs position as a border state of the EU is vitally important. However, concerns have been raised both about Greece‚Äôs ability to identify those in need of protection among migration flows heading towards the country, and about its comparatively under-developed asylum system. The country‚Äôs handling of the Iraqis that have fled as part of the displacement crisis would certainly suggest that much must still be done to improve Greece‚Äôs ability to provide protection to refugees. In 2006 alone the Greek Ministry of Public Order (MPO) arrested a total of 8,157 Iraqis as illegal entrants. As for those Iraqi asylum-seekers who were able to deposit an official claim with the Greek authorities, the overwhelming majority of them saw their claims rejected in the first instance, as the acceptance rate in 2006 was 0 per cent. According to Greek law, rejected asylum-seekers have the right to appeal, but in a unique move the Greek authorities decided to freeze decision-making on all appeals from Iraqis who entered the country since 2003. Most Iraqis who reach Greece have therefore chosen to travel north or west to claim asylum elsewhere. Demography Males dominate the Iraqi population in Greece at 68 per cent, whereas females are only accountable for 32 per cent of the population. Amongst the Iraqi community, 70 per cent are young individuals in their twenties and thirties, with only some 10 per cent being over the age of 50. Young single men form the majority of the Iraqi presence in Greece However, there is a substantial population that are married at 65 per cent, most of which leave behind their wive and children behind, with the intention of bringing them once they have completed any formal documents. In which most of these marriages tend to be mixed, equally between Sunni, Shia, Assyrian, Armenian, Kurd and Turkomen. Only a small percentage are widows and divorcees. =Ethnic and religious composition= The Iraqi population in Greece varies greatly, reflecting Iraq's diversity. Kurds dominate the Iraqi inhabitants, with a 50 per cent in total, this is then followed by Christians, which are believed to be at around a quarter, the Turkmen's are behind with 15 per cent followed by an equal number of Arabs. Amongst the Kurds, Sunni Muslims form the majority with a Shia Feyli minority. Turkmen are also Sunni Muslim, speak a dialect of Turkish and form a small percentage of Iraqis in Greece. The Iraqi Arabs who arrived in Greece are Muslims from the central and southern parts of Iraq, mostly Sunni with a tiny Shia minority. Sunni Arabs form 17 per cent of the total Iraqi population, which is almost an equal amount if not more than their Turkmen counterparts. Assyrians have a disproportionately large representation amongst Iraqis in Greece, this could be primarily because Greece has a Christian society, in which Iraqi Christians will find it easy to settle down in. Forming a quarter of the population in Greece, Iraqi Christians make up the majority of Christians from the Middle East, who arrived in Greece from the early 1990s. Most immigrants arriving in Greece came from the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which stands at around 45 per cent, the other 30 per cent came from capital Baghdad, followed by 20 per cent originating from Mosul. Education The educational level amongst Iraqis is generally very high, as they are well-educated and many of which hold university degrees. Although many have already completed higher education, the average age of an Iraqi refugee and asylum seeker is relatively low, in which the majority has not yet had any opportunities to work in their chosen profession and hence their theoretical knowledge remains undeveloped.

The series traces the disparate storylines of a young carnival worker named Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a preacher in California. The overarching story is built around a good and evil theme, which serves as a human-scaled metaphor within a complex structure of myth and allegory. Samson, the carnival's dwarf manager, sets up the show's mythology with a prologue in the pilot episode, talking of \\"a creature of light and a creature of darkness\\" being born \\"to each generation\\" preparing for a final battle. Most mythological elements in Carniv√†le relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carniv√†le does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf did not respond to questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carniv√†le. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carniv√†le's first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.  Avatars  The term Avatar (also spelled Avatara) originates in Hindu mythology, where it most commonly refers to the incarnation (bodily manifestation) of a higher being or the Supreme Being on Earth. Carniv√†le's story never clearly establishes the meaning of this term, yet HBO and the writers used the term interchangeably with the Creatures of Light and Darkness of the series' opening monologue. The series portrays Avatars as human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil, and whose constant and age-long struggle serves to explain the Dark Ages and Ages of Enlightenment in humanity's history in the real world. Carniv√†le represents this Avataric duality as Light and Dark in several instances. The surnames of the main characters, Ben Hawkins and Justin Crowe, suggest a symbolic link to hawks and crows, the winged Creatures of Light and Dark. The last two Tarot cards seen in the Carniv√†le's opening title sequence are \\"The Sun\\" and \\"The Moon\\", standing for God and the Devil. By the same token, the show's title card and the logo of the carnival depict a sun placed opposite a moon. Show creator Daniel Knauf designed this logo. = Characteristics = The characters Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe are revealed to be Avatars through the usage of their supernatural powers; however, viewers did not find it immediately apparent whether a suspected Avatar served as good or evil. The series gave clues, such as depicting the Creatures of Darkness with coal-black eyes (according to Daniel Knauf, Creatures of Light have an invisible aura). An Avatar's nature is determined by the type and application of his powers. As the Pitch Document states, Avatars draw their talents and powers from the same pool. These abilities may vary in type and strength, and include but are not limited to the manipulation and transfer of life force, spiritual healings, telekinesis and telepathy, and granting small measures of powers to a mortal.Pitch Document (CARNIVALE Backstory and Mythology.doc) and character biographies (CHARACTER BIOS TEXT ONLY.doc) at Yahoo Carnivale HBO Files (registration required) (July 1, 2007). Character biographies previously auctioned at the Clancy Brown Fan Club Charity Auction (May 16-30, 2007). Retrieved on 2007-08-05. Although the series showed the powers of Ben and Brother Justin, reviewers were still unsure about the main characters' Avataric nature by the end of the first season. When Ben's good nature and Justin's dark heritage became clearer in Season 2, reviewers began to describe Carniv√†le's underlying message as \\"essentially the opposite of spiritual belief: fatalism\\". Daniel Knauf disputed any theory of determinism, and repeatedly pointed to the characters' free will to overcome their destiny. Free choice allows the story to portray Avatars as deliberately not making use of their powers or as acting contrary to their nature; an Avatar would however still have to put consistent effort into not lapsing back into his defined moral behavior. The Pitch Document described Avatars as sharing the ability to envision the past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright and can be improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only Creatures of Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar of like kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carniv√†le. = Terms and order of succession = Daniel Knauf overlaid the Avatars of the fictional universe with an elaborate order of succession by blood, similar to the ascent of royal families. The descriptors Royals, King and Prince are replaced in the series with Vectori, Prophet and Prince. Female royals like Queens and Princesses do not have a fictional counterpart and are instead replaced with the concepts of the Alpha, the Omega and the Usher. These Wild Card Avatars have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones. Reviewers rarely focused on the significance of the mentioned Avataric terms and their implied characteristics in the story, despite detailed explanations by Knauf and the later public availability of Carniv√†le's Pitch Document, setting out the complex mythological structure. The first Prophet in the mythology of Carniv√†le is the Alpha. This creature is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with the destruction of the Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male. The Avataric Blood travels within families forming a dynasty. The first-born son of an Avatar receives a so-called mantle at birth that manifests him as an Avatar of a new generation; whether the new Avatar is Light or Dark is chance. Therefore, there is one Avatar to each House per generation.Chat with Daniel Knauf. carnycon.com (offline) (February 20, 2005). Archived in parts at Yahoo Carnivale HBO (registration required). Retrieved on 2007-07-28. Giving birth to a new Avatar leaves the mother barren and insane. Before that time, she can give birth to an unlimited number of females from an Avatar. These children as well as their respective offspring are called Vectori, beings with Avataric Blood who are not themselves Avatara, and who thus become generationally further removed from an Avatar in the bloodline. While Vectori cannot become Avatara, as that mantle is only conveyed upon birth, they can still exhibit some minor powers and often show signs of insanity. (Based on Daniel Knauf's note on Yahoo Carnivale HBO via Beth Blighton from March 10, 2005 (registration required)). The eldest generational Avatar within a House is dominant and called the Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any means. When a dynasty ends, the first male child born elsewhere in the world with the most Avataric blood will be a new Prince starting a new dynasty. When a Prophet dies while an Ascendant Prince also lives, one of two things happens. If the Prophet is killed by his Ascendant Prince, the Prince will gain the mantle of the Prophet with a boon (full measure of power). For the boon to be passed, the Prophet must be of sound mind, and either willingly pass on the boon, or be taken by surprise so that he cannot put up a psychic defense. If however the Prophet is impaired, the Ascendant Prince may be driven insane. If a Prophet dies in any other way, the Ascendant Prince will be automatically raised to Prophet in his stead, without chance of a boon. * Wilfred Talbot Smith: \\"You bleed like a man. He is still alive. [...] By the hand of the Prince, the Prophet dies. Upon his death, the Prince shall rise. [...] The Gospel of Matthias. Chapter 3, verses 26 through 28. [...] You have to kill him with your own hands... Henry Scudder.\\" / Brother Justin: \\"Then what?\\" / Smith: \\"You'll be the prophet. The Usher. [...] Kill him [Scudder], and you will receive the divine blood.\\" * Wilfred Talbot Smith (to Brother Justin about Henry Scudder): \\"His mind must be clear during the passing. If he is impaired or delusional, the result would be disastrous. [...] Madness, or even death. [...] The only way to receive the full measure of the boon is if it's freely granted, in sound mind, by the prophet. [...] He [Scudder] would have no choice if you took him by surprise. [...] You must take the boon by force. [...] But if you hesitate, he may escape, and the boon will forever be lost to you.\\" Two unique Avatars join the Alpha as an exception to the Avataric rule. Carniv√†le's Avataric mythology prophesied the Usher of Destruction throughout the ages as a harbinger of the End Times to usher in the Armageddon. He is known by a thousand names in a thousand books, but can only manifest once. He appears as the Tattooed Man in visions, * Management: \\"You have seen the Usher. The tattooed man. [...] Samhain, Necrotus, Khaybet, Lord of Shadows. A thousand names in a thousand books, but they all mean the same. The Usher of Destruction.\\" and he can only be killed with a weapon infused with the Vitae Divina that is thrust into the bough of his tree tattoo where his dark heart dwells. Injuries from such anointed weapons are said to never fully heal. * Wilfred Talbot Smith: \\"Your enemy has received his boon. [...] What concerns me more is this business you mentioned with the knife. '[From The Gospel of Matthias:] Anointed dagger, plunge thee deep.'\\" / Brother Justin: \\"'Anointed'?\\" / Smith: \\"Infused with Avataric blood. If he has it in his possession along with the boon, he not only has the strength, but the means to destroy you.\\" * Belyakov (to Ben in a vision): \\"Behold the Usher. A dark heart dwells where branches meet. Anointed dagger plunge thee deep.\\" Also prophesied is the Omega (known in the Pitch Document as Omega The Destroyer and the Antichrist), whom Carniv√†le's occult characters had assumed for a long time to be one and the same with the Usher.Chat with Daniel Knauf (April 18, 2005). Summarized and archived in parts at Yahoo Carnivale HBO (registration required). Retrieved on 2007-08-01. The Omega is, like the Alpha, a female and the only other known exception to the male restriction in Avatar succession, and because of the allusion to \\"the Beginning and the End\\" in naming, the Omega is commonly accepted as the last Avatar. = Manifestation in the series = The Gospel of Matthias in the episode \\"Alamogordo, NM\\". Certain characters have seemingly supernatural abilities from the beginning of the series. Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe not only have common visions of two soldiers (one of them also appearing in a tuxedo) and a man with a tattooed tree on his chest, but also of each other. Ben can heal and resurrect beings at the cost of others' life, while Brother Justin can read and manipulate people's minds. Ben and Lodz, a blind mentalist of the carnival, experience visions of the medieval Knights Templar. Carnival fortuneteller Sofie can communicate telepathically with her catatonic mother, whom she once sees being raped by the Tattooed Man. The progressing story increases the importance of the two mysterious soldiers, who are revealed as Henry Scudder and Management. Strange words of unknown meaning appear throughout the series. Variations of the phrase \\"Every Prophet in his House\\" are repeated, seemingly without context. * Waitress (to Ben and Brother Justin in a shared dream): \\"Every prophet in his house.\\" * Templar (to Sofie): \\"Every prophet in her house.\\" * Child Sofie (to Sofie in a vision): \\"Every prophet in her house.\\" * Black-eyed Sofie (to Sofie in a vision): \\"This is your house.\\" Ben finds the repeating letter string TARAVATARAVA in a mineshaft, which he is later able to interpret as Avatar. Season 2 introduces the word Usher in particular relation to Brother Justin. * Wilfred Talbot Smith (reading ancient text): \\"And that you know he is true by his words, the Usher will declare...\\" / Brother Justin (on the radio): \\"The greatest Commandment, brothers and sisters, is... \\" / Smith and Brother Justin (in unison): \\"Thou shalt be strong.\\" * Brother Justin (hearing his own voice in a vision when the Tattooed Man cuts his own hand revealing blue blood): \\"He is the Usher.\\" * Smith: \\"I'm here for the Usher.\\" / Brother Justin: \\"What?\\" / Smith: \\"The Usher?\\" Management repeats this term to Ben in two instances. After Management's death, Ben has sudden knowledge about Princes, Prophets and the Usher, even knowing to whom these terms apply, respectively. * Ben: \\"'By the hand of the Prince, the Prophet dies. Upon his death, the Prince shall rise.' - The Prince, that's me. Management was the Prophet. It's all in this book. He needed me to kill him. [...] When I killed him, everything he was, everything he knew, everything he believed, he gave it to me. He had to. He knew that was the only chance I had against the Usher.\\" / Samson: \\"The Usher?\\" / Ben: \\"Alexei Belyakov, his son.\\" The sentence \\"Sofie is the Omega\\" is seen once, written across a mirror without further explanation. Sofie demonstrates powers and attributes similar to those of Ben and Brother Justin in the last Carniv√†le episode. The context for some of these events is provided by the (fictionally used) Gospel of Matthias, a book in Season 2 that connects the Templars to Ben's father. * Written inside the Gospel of Matthias: \\"Benevolent Order of Templar Chapter 106 Loving, New Mexico ~~Robert Morgan; James Parks; Carlton Smith; Eugene Shoben; Gregory Austin;~~ Henry Scudder.\\" * Templar Frank Mooney: \\"They showed up one day, him [Scudder] and another fella. [...] Ten, twelve years ago. [...] Scudder, he got real cozy with our chaplain, Kerrigan. And he stole some books out of our library. [...] Holy books, Gospels. And then they lit out.\\" Written in archaic English, reminiscent of the King James Bible translation, it contains parts of Samson's Season 1 prologue, mentions the Avatara, and alludes to an apocalyptic passage in the Book of Revelation. It also contains etchings of a gnarled and bent tree, which in one image is attacked by a Knight Templar holding a knife. Wilfred Talbot Smith interprets this book to Brother Justin, quoting, \\"By the hand of the Prince, the Prophet dies. Upon his death, the Prince shall rise,\\" and \\"[Behold the Usher. A dark heart dwells where branches meet.] Anointed dagger plunge thee deep.\\" Management and Ben repeat these verses independently of Smith.  What is an Avatar?  As confirmed by Daniel Knauf and the Pitch Document, the Avatars of the current generation (at the end of Season 2) are Ben as the Creature of Light and Brother Justin as the Creature of Darkness. Justin is also the Usher, spiritually represented by the Tattooed Man. Their respective fathers were Avatars of the previous generation: Henry Scudder was the Creature of Darkness, and Lucius Belyakov (Management) was the Creature of Light. At each time, an Avatar's blood color mirrored his status. Ben's and Brother Justin's blood were red when they were Princes, and upon becoming Prophets, their blood turned into Vitae Divina (blue blood). Scudder's father Hilton was an Avatar of undisclosed nature. The mentalist of the carnival, Lodz, was merely a mortal who had once received Avataric skills from Scudder in exchange for his sense of sight. Several women in Carniv√†le are tied to Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's daughter Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. * Written with lipstick across a mirror by Ruthie (possessed by Lodz): \\"Sofie is the Omega -L\\" Although Sofie is two years older than Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar. Knauf hinted at more Avatars in a February 2005 chat: \\"What do Jesus, Caligula, Alexander the Great, Caesar, Buddha, Vlad the Impaler, Brother Justin, Ben Hawkins, Luscius Belyakov, Hilton Scudder, and Henry Scudder have in common?\\" The Pitch Document stated, \\"If an Avatar was dedicated to developing and mastering his power, he could direct it with the precision of a scalpel. Such was the case with many of the Prophets, with Buddha, Jesus and Mohammed, with Caligula and Vlad Dracul.\\" In this early plot summary, Rasputin and the Borgias were Avatars as well. But like other Avatars in Carniv√†le, none of these historical figures were explicitly revealed as such on the show.  The Tattooed Man and the tree  Storyboard sketch of the Tattooed Man. A man with a tattooed tree on his chest and back is introduced in the opening minutes of Carniv√†le's pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carniv√†le. Show creator Daniel Knauf stated that the tree in Carniv√†le is the iconic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. Its implied meaning and power prompted him to place it on the Tattooed Man's chest because \\"this is where you will build your empire. This is what it all boils down, [...] and it just had a certain power.\\" Played by Don Swayze, the Tattooed Man is often depicted without a focus on his face, although a few frames in the pilot episode show him played by Clancy Brown (Brother Justin). Knauf confirmed the Tattooed Man as the spiritual representation of the Usher of Destruction.  Historical and cultural allusions  = Dust Bowl = The story of Carniv√†le takes place in the mid-1930s during the worst of the Great Depression, a time of massive social and political upheaval. Unemployment rates were high, and European fascism was on the rise, in the years leading up to the Second World War. People in the Great Plains suffered from the effects of the Dust Bowl. Farmers often not only ran into debt and lost their properties but also risked their health; dust pneumonia was a common cause of death. Carniv√†le is a retrospective interpretation of these times. Okie Ben loses his mother and his farm to the dust when a carnival picks him up. While the carnival travels throughout the Southwestern United States, California preacher Brother Justin tends to the needs of Dust Bowl refugees, who slowly become his biggest supporters. Although Carniv√†le replaces the real sociological-scientific reasons for the drought conditions with fantasy elements and the presence of the Devil, it still addresses the Dust Bowl situation repeatedly. Samson's catch phrases are variations of \\"Let's shake some dust!\\" The episode \\"Black Blizzard\\" focuses on Ben and the carnival coping with a major dust storm. Rain only occurs twice in the show. The first occurrence is when Ben and Sofie copulate; the writers wanted to highlight that Avataric sex \\"affects the heavens\\". The second is when Brother Justin forcibly takes the Boon from Henry Scudder in the episode \\"Cheyenne, WY\\". List of Carny lingo at hbo.com. Retrieved 2007-10-07. = Religion = A major part of Carniv√†le's story is religion. Samson's prologue in the pilot episode is based on a few introduction paragraphs on the Pitch Document's cover sheet that were initially not planned to be performed . But whereas Samson's prologue only shortly mentions the Genesis creation narrative before introducing the fictional mythology, the original segment put more emphasis on the battle between God and Satan: > \\"Before the Beginning, after the great celestial war that rocked the very > foundation of Heaven and Hell, God and Satan established an uneasy truce. > Never again would they face each other in direct confrontation. So God > created the Earth, inhabiting it with the crafty ape he called Man. And > henceforth, to each generation was born a creature of Light and a creature > of Darkness, and they would gather to them men of ilk nature and thus, by > proxy, carry on the war between Good and Evil.\\" Show creator Daniel Knauf believed Carniv√†le's religious aspects stemmed from the epic of good and evil as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways. Daniel Knauf felt that Brother Justin shares patterns with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their delusional visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, but when the producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans to make him a Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clich√©d, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no. Carniv√†le relies on other religious symbols and parallels for its mythology. The National Shrine of the Little Flower, funded by Father Coughlin in the 1930s, was an inspiration for the temple in Brother Justin's vision in the episode \\"Los Moscos\\". This vision foreshadows the world that Justin will potentially build as he comes to power as a radio preacher. The producers planned to use radio towers instead of regular steeples for the temple; the design also incorporated Eastern European domes and Western European cathedrals. In the same vision, the Tattooed Man appears near a tree that resembles the iconic Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and implies that Justin is the Usher. According to Knauf, the Usher represents a \\"timeless character who shows up in all different cultures\\", and who is \\"there to usher in the Armageddon\\" as \\"the harbinger of End times\\". = Knights Templar = The Knights Templar symbol in Carniv√†le. Carniv√†le introduces the Knights Templar, a medieval Christian military order, in the late Season 1 episode \\"Lonnigan, TX\\", where Ben meets the freak finder Phineas Boffo. When Ben comes in contact with Boffo's ring, he experiences a powerful series of visions of the Knights Templar practicing rituals, putting heads on spikes, and being burned at the stake. The ring bears a red-crossed symbol, and when Samson passes a trinket with the same symbol to Lodz, the mentalist has the same visions as Ben and falls to the floor chanting \\"in hoc signo vinces\\" (\\"in this sign you will conquer\\"). The Knights Templar remain a recurring subplot until Ben discovers the symbol's significance in early Season 2. The Lodge of the Benevolent Order of Templar has its last appearance in the mid-Season-2 episode \\"Old Cherry Blossom Road\\", where the escaped convict Varlyn Stroud uses it to track Ben. When Wilfred Talbot Smith asks for the location of the Sauni√®re manuscript late in Season 2, Scudder answers that it is hidden in Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau. * Wilfred Talbot Smith: \\"Henry, I spoke with Bennington. He says you have the Sauni√®re manuscript. Where is it? Where? [...]\\" / Henry Scudder: \\"The priory, behind the sacristy.\\" / Smith: \\"Where?\\" / Scudder: \\"Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau.\\" Despite being of only tangential importance to the series' two seasons, the Knights Templar have an elaborate backstory that was left untold due to the cancellation. The Pitch Document described the fictional Order, then simply called the \\"Order Templar\\", as a fraternity of fellow travelers that was once charged by the Roman Catholic Church with locating and aiding the Avatars. Knauf said both Henry Scudder and his father Hilton were members of the Templars; Scudder was so because he wanted access to their knowledge and library. The Sauni√®re manuscript would have been \\"mildly relevant\\" for the future storyline. = Trinity = Trinity tower. The Season 2 episode \\"Los Moscos\\" has Management urge Ben to seek Scudder; Ben needs to learn the name of the preacher of his dreams (Brother Justin) to prevent a future catastrophe. An induced vision transports Ben into a desert where he suddenly hears an alarm-like noise. A massive explosion occurs, followed by a rising mushroom cloud. When Ben opens his eyes from the blast of dust, Justin kneels in front of him and asks \\"Ye offspring of serpents, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\\" Ben drives past this location one episode later in \\"Alamogordo, NM\\". In a shared vision in the episode \\"Creed, OK\\", Ben and Sofie kiss in a desert, surrounded by bright light and swirling dust. Season 2 takes place in 1935. Reviews interpreted these visions as Ben's challenge to find and defeat Brother Justin; Ben has to ultimately stop the creation of the atomic bomb as \\"the world's march towards doomsday.\\" The Season 1 prologue already suggested this interpretation, mentioning \\"a false sun explod[ing] over Trinity,\\" at which point \\"man forever traded away wonder for reason.\\" The Trinity test near Alamogordo, New Mexico was humankind's first test of a nuclear weapon in 1945, and Daniel Knauf would have finished Carniv√†le's six-year run with the explosion of an atomic bomb as the beginning of the \\"Age of Reason\\".Summer 2003 Cable TCA Press Tour (July 10, 2003). Transcript at centimes.demon.co.uk . Retrieved on 2007-08-11. Still, Knauf's story is \\"not about the deployment of the bomb, it's more about the invention of the bomb,\\" with the focus \\"around Alamogordo and the Trinity test site rather than Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\" Much research was put into the visual effects of the explosion. Stock footage of the first beats of nuclear explosions and a self-created explosion of 300 gallons of gasoline were used for reference. The ground effects and blowing dust were created with combinations of volumetric computer graphics smoke, and the fireball of the nuclear explosion was built from Hubble images of the Sun. Knauf left the interpretation of the kiss vision open to both the characters and the audience. = Tarot divination = The tarot readings of fortunetellers Sofie and her mother Apollonia advance the plot significantly. Sofie's readings in the pilot episode induce visions in Ben that give insight into his healing powers of his childhood. Season 2 shows Sofie's attempts to leave her former job, which is repeatedly interrupted by tarot cards reappearing. Another of her readings sets Ben on a journey to Scudder, the man he has been looking for since the beginning of the series. When incorporating tarot symbolism into the show, show creator Daniel Knauf started with the Rider-Waite tarot deck and then took liberties in interpretation. The same deck was used in the series and in several web games, as tarot divination played a significant part in Carniv√†le's online marketing. The producers had wished to provide a \\"personalized, interactive tarot-card reading experience similar to what is depicted in the series\\". The official HBO website collaborated with RealNetworks to offer Fate: The Carniv√†le Game, a downloadable game based on tarot symbolism available for trial and purchase. Carniv√†le's opening title sequence features tarot cards that are panned in and out of in camera perspective; these cards were digitally designed based on paintings and are not available for purchase. As the creative team behind the opening titles stated, it was their goal \\"to create a title sequence that grounded viewers in the mid-1930s, but that also allowed people to feel a larger presence of good and evil over all of time.\\" The creators offered a detailed interpretation of the tarot cards in the opening titles, and covered topics like good and bad, heaven and hell, wars, and the age of science as the antireligion in the 1930s. The following list specifies the tarot cards featured in the opening sequence, the provided keywords and the used artwork. * \\"The World\\" ‚Äî Completion. Perfection. Eternal life. ‚Äì The Last Judgment by Michelangelo. * \\"Ace of Swords\\" ‚Äî Ardent love. Ardent hate.

Moore was confident that Carniv√†le was one of the most complicated shows on television, while show creator Daniel Knauf admitted that \\"you may not understand everything that goes on but it does make a certain sense.\\" In stating that Carniv√†le was meant to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext, Knauf refrained from giving explicit clues. He did not wish his intent as an author to supersede the viewer's interpretation. = Interpretations during the run of Carniv√†le = Reviewers of the first three episodes interpreted Carniv√†le's story as being full of myth and allegory. The show was seen as more than just a human-scaled metaphor of good and evil, with the power of spirits as one of the show's strongest elements. Some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as \\"mysterious\\" - the characters and their powers and abilities, characters and scenarios within visions, the whole carnival - wondering how it all fit together. The visions of the two main characters were shortly addressed, distinguishing between violent and benign visions, but parallels between the visions and the beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn. The characters' stories were described as unfolding in \\"zig-zagging starts, moving back and forth in time and space, dropping oblique clues along the way.\\" Carniv√†le's central premise was considered \\"cloudy\\", \\"unconventional\\", and filled with \\"convoluted symbolic interpretations of historical events\\" after Daniel Knauf had told TV critics that he regarded the 1930s as \\"the last great age of magic\\" being ended by an atomic bomb to herald the Age of Reason. Many reviews quoted and commented on Samson's prologue to explain both the apocalyptic premise and the mythology of the show. Some reviews asserted that the good and evil creatures described in the prologue were Ben and Justin, preparing for a final battle. Still, many reviews were reluctant to state who of the main characters was good and who was evil, aware that it might take some time until this question was answered for sure. Ben and his healing powers led most reviewers to believe that he was the good creature, and that Justin was a demon or at least a dangerous zealot who received instructions from either God or Satan. Some reviews described the question of Ben's parentage as one of the big puzzles and the show's driving mystery, but refrained from defining further details of the series. The lack of revelation of the characters' roles was apparent by the end of the first season, although critics expected Sofie to gain significance later in the story. DVD reviews for Season 1 and previews for the Season 2 premiere had the advantage of retrospective on the first season, and some reviewers continued to consider the show's mythology convoluted, circuitous, \\"peek-a-boo\\" and silly. The significance of the prologue was emphasized again, while previous reviewers' character descriptions, the good-versus-evil theme and the assumed story merge were generally repeated. The good nature of Ben and evil nature of Brother Justin seemed clearer to most reviewers, with \\"many bizarre coincidences that seem to imply a deeper and more sinister connection\\" between the two main characters. Visions were summarized as disturbing and grotesque, dreams as cryptic and mysterious, and abilities as unexplainable. Henry Scudder was noted to be \\"connected to everything and everyone\\", and it was considered Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The events of early Season 2 were said to mark a shift in the story from mystery to journey, with Ben accepting and exploring his powers, while Brother Justin was seen completely embracing his evil nature. Reviewers regarded Sofie's turn in the final episode as an unexpected new threat in the story. = Reception and analysis of themes = Carniv√†le was often compared to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carniv√†le \\"the perfect show for those who thought Twin Peaks was too accessible\\", whereas the show reminded Salon.com's Heather Havrilesky of the \\"disappointment you feel as a kid when you come to the last few pages of The Grapes of Wrath.\\" She argued that a \\"surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating,\\" especially if it \\"avoid[s] the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [by serving up] such a steady diet of anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection.\\" Carniv√†le, as The Australian stated, \\"seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms\\" which \\"can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television.\\" A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carniv√†le as \\"too artsy and esoteric\\" because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding \\"what the heck was going on, [which] can be a problem for a dramatic television series.\\" TV Zone however considered Carniv√†le \\"a series like no other and [...] the fact that it is so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths.\\" Carniv√†le was lauded for bringing \\"the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life\\" and for being among the first TV shows to show \\"unmitigated pain and disappointment\\", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the \\"slowly unfolding sadness\\" appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show. = Fate and legacy of the mythological storytelling of Carniv√†le = Viewership did drop significantly in Season 2, and Carniv√†le was cancelled in 2005 after two of six planned seasons. In a post-cancellation interview, Daniel Knauf was positive that someone would let him finish his story someday, if not as a television series, then possibly as a series of features or graphic novels. Knauf approached Marvel Comics to continue the future Carniv√†le storyline that he had kept to himself. They seemed interested, but HBO, who own the show and the characters, would not confer their rights. During the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Knauf stated that \\"an idiosyncratic show like Carniv√†le would never be greenlit today,\\" and claimed that present-day television included a high percentage of \\"talking heads\\" with \\"the vast majority of television writers [not being] visual storytellers.\\" Enjoying his creative freedom as graphic storyteller, he has considered directing his efforts away from television series creation. Meanwhile, the mythology of Carniv√†le remains in the public conscience. In 2008, Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembered Carniv√†le as a \\"smart, ambitious series that move[s] unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively,\\" while A.V. Club called the show \\"a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology\\".

Zoumbaris. (2014). Encyclopedia of Diet Fads: Understanding Science and Society, 2nd Edition. ABC-CLIO. p. 214. On March 10, 1980, just eight days before his 70th birthday, Tarnower was shot dead by Jean Harris. Harris was convicted of his murder at trial in White Plains, New York in 1981. Early life Herman Tarnower was born in Brooklyn to Jewish immigrants Harry and Dora Tarnower. He attended Syracuse University where he obtained his M.D. in 1933. He became a physician, specializing in cardiology. Tarnower established a cardiology practice in the Scarsdale and White Plains areas of New York. During World War II, he joined the US Army Medical Corps and was promoted to major. After the war, he initiated the Scarsdale Medical Center and was well regarded among his colleagues and patients. From 1975 until his death he was clinical professor of medicine at the New York Medical College. The Scarsdale diet's idea of reducing carbohydrates, eating plenty of oily fish and lean meat with fruit and vegetables and having a low intake of fats, salt and sweets was novel at the time and when The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet was published in 1979, it became an immediate bestseller. However, the Scarsdale diet was dismissed by medical experts and is often listed as an example of a fad diet.Feldman, Elaine B. (1988). Essentials of Clinical Nutrition. F. A. Davis Company. p. 141. The diet was criticized by Henry Buchwald and colleagues for \\"serious nutritional deficiencies\\".Buchwald, Henry; Cowan, George S. M; Pories, Walter J. (2007). Surgical Management of Obesity.

March 31, 1980 The Headmistress and the Diet Doctor A lifelong bachelor, he continued to date other women during the course of their relationship. In 1979, he was having an affair with Lynne Tryforos, who worked as a secretary in his office. This caused tension between Harris and Tarnower, although Harris stated that the affair with Tryforos had been taking place for the preceding few years. On March 10, 1980, Harris drove from the Madeira School in McLean, Virginia to Tarnower's home in Purchase, New York with a .32 caliber pistol in her possession. At trial, she stated she had planned to commit suicide after talking in person with Tarnower one last time. When she arrived at the house, however, she noticed Tryforos' lingerie in the bedroom. An argument ensued, and Tarnower allegedly said to her, \\"Jesus, Jean, you're crazy! Get out of here!\\" Harris shot the 69-year-old Tarnower four times at close range, killing him. Harris was arrested and tried for second-degree murder, claiming at the three-month trial that the gun had discharged accidentally while Tarnower tried to wrestle it away from her. The jury did not believe her testimony and convicted her of murder because manslaughter was not an option during the deliberations. Judge Russell Leggett sentenced Harris to the minimum of 15-years-to-life in prison. However, she was granted clemency by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1992 and paroled in 1993.Joseph Bergerdec for the New York Times.

Every two years there is a Village Show(previously known as the Flower Show) which is run jointly with the neighbouring settlement of Rowington which hosts the show in the other years. In May 2015, an Antony Gormley statue of an iron man was placed by the canal lock here. The statue was one of five life-sized sculptures, known as Land, that were placed near the centre and at four compass points of the UK in a commission by the Landmark Trust to celebrate its 50th anniversary. It was removed in May 2016. Geography The Stratford- upon-Avon Canal runs through Lowsonford, and there are several locks. History The village hall was built in 1936 and its main room can seat 75 people. The village church is dedicated to St Luke. In 2019, the Daily Mirror identified the B95 postcode, which covers Lowsonford, as having been the United Kingdom's burglary hotspot in 2018. The study however was based on number of claims made per thousand insurance policies rather than total number of burglaries or percentage of households burgled.

History The large-scale Guides were mainly intended for people traveling by boat along the river or canal, but now include a number of non-navigable waterways. Generally, each page includes a map of a section of the waterway with features such as bridges, locks, boatyards and services. Each section of the map includes references to nearby pubs, towns and villages, roads and railways. Robert Nicholson had published a series of guides to London in the 1960s, before realising that there was nothing about the River Thames, so in 1969 he published Nicholson's Guide to the Thames. With the rise of leisure boating in the early 1970s, British Waterways commissioned Nicholson to write a series of guides to their waterways, in a similar style to the Thames book. In order to research them, a boat was chartered, Paul Atterbury and Andrew Darwin were asked to write the material, and a student was hired to drive the boat. The guides documented eating places near to the canals, points of interest that could be easily visited, and every facility for boaters that they found, from water points to winding holes. Between them, they developed a style which lasted until the 1990s. The first edition sold for 75 pence, but by the early 1980s the price had increased to ¬£1.50. The format was a tall thin book which had the canal running top to bottom of each page, with the location north being adjusted to suit this format. Often pages had the canal 'straightened' mid page, with the location of north changing at the split point. The first edition came out as four Guides: :1 South East :2 North West :3 South West :4 North East A fifth Guide, The Midlands, came out in the early 1980s. The first series of guides were produced as pocket-sized hardback books. In 1981 the 'second revised edition' came in only three chapters; 3 North, 2 Midlands, 1 South and dropped the British Waterway Board affiliation. This edition was printed in two colours, black and blue, with the line of the canal being picked out in blue on an otherwise black and white map. In 1985 the 'second edition' , now titled 'The Ordanace Survey Guide to the Waterway' published by Nicholsons had four guides: 3 North, 2 Central, 1 South. Thames (and Wey). By this time, the format had changed to spiral-bound paperback books, and a fifth guide, covering the Fens and the Broads in a single book was added in the late 1980s. The fifth edition in 1991 included 5 books: :1 South :2 Central :3 North :River Thames :Broads & Fens 7th Edition 1995, by this time Nicholsons had been an 'Imprint' of Harper Collins and was back down to four books, with a fifth publication being the first foldout small-scale map covering Great Britain. :1 South :2 Central :3 North :River Thames :Guide to Great Britain A major change occurred in the mid-1990s, when Ordnance Survey announced that the two-tone maps should be replaced by full-colour maps. Nicholson's had been taken over by Bartholomews, and they had subsequently been taken over by HarperCollins. Throughout, David Perrott, who had been an apprentice of Robert Nicholson in 1969 when the first Thames book was produced, had remained as editor. Collins wrestled with the Ordnance Survey ultimatum for some 14 months, before deciding to proceed with full colour mapping, and seven regional guides were produced, in a format which was still current in 2019. They also produced a fold-out waterways map, and later guides to the Broads and the Scottish Canals. Surprisingly, research had been conducted by offering the researchers money to pay for bed and breakfast, and a contribution towards fuel for a boat until this time, but with the new editions, remuneration of the researchers was finally covered by a commercial agreement. The 1997/2000/2003/2007 editions were extended to 8 books: :1 Grand Union, Oxford & the South East :2 Severn, Avon & Birmingham :3 Birmingham & the Heart of England :4 Four Counties & the Welsh Canals :5 North West & the Pennines :6 Nottingham, York & the North East :7 River Thames & the Southern Waterways :8 Scotland, the Highland and Lowland Waterways (only in the 2003 edition) There are also two small-scale fold-out maps, one covering Great Britain in its entirety, and one of Scottish waterways. From 1997 the maps became A5 format, and maps were in full colour, with the canal overlaid onto the current OS map of the time, north was fixed as being at the top of each page. Jonathan Mosse became part of the research team in 1989, and his first major contribution was to cycle the towpath of the Kennet and Avon Canal, then reaching the end of a lengthy restoration. His work was added to the Southern guide. The policy had been to update all of the guides every three years, but this has been revised so that two or three guides are updated each year. The guides have also been reworked to reach a wider audience, by the inclusion of any waterway that can be followed from one end to the other, on foot or by bicycle. Thus the Northern Reaches of the Lancaster Canal were added to the 2019 reprint of the North West and the Pennines guide.

There have been some cases in which an act of homicide has occurred and the prime suspect may have committed the act while sleepwalking. The veracity of recorded cases is disputed. About 69 cases had been reported in the literature up to the year 2005. One such case is that of Kenneth Parks, who was acquitted of the murder of his mother-in-law in 1987 after using the sleepwalking defense. Causes Sleepwalking occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS), the deepest stages of non- REM sleep, Popat, Shreeya; Winslade, William ‚ÄúWhile You Were Sleepwalking: Science and Neurobiology of Sleep Disorders & the Enigma of Legal Responsibility of Violence During Parasomnia‚Äù: Neuroethics (2015); 8(2): 203‚Äì214. while there are other parasomnias that occur from REM sleep. It is caused by an inappropriate physiological event where the brain tries to exit SWS and go straight to wake. In normal sleep, the brain makes the transition from sleep either from stages 1 or 2 of NREM or REM sleep, but almost never from SWS. As a result, the brain gets ‚Äústuck‚Äù between a sleep and wake state.Bassetti et al., Lancet (2000); 356: 484‚Äì485 In the case of Kenneth Parks, his EEG showed an abnormality where his brain tried to wake from SWS 10 to 20 times a night. It remains unknown why some people will commit murders in their sleepwalking episodes, but it seems reasonable to assume that many conditions must be met. Kenneth Parks, for example, was planning to go to his in-laws‚Äô residence the next day, he was stressed and depressed from his marital and financial troubles, and he had been sleep deprived because he could get no sleep the night before. Notable cases = Boshears case = Sergeant Willis Boshears was a US serviceman based in the UK. He confessed to strangling a local woman named Jean Constable in the early hours on New Years Day 1961, but claimed that he was asleep and only woke to realize what he had done. The following day, Boshears disposed of the body in an isolated lane. Several days later he was arrested and charged with murder. At his trial in February 1961 at the Essex Assizes he pled not guilty on the basis of being asleep at the time he committed the offence and was acquitted.Essex Murders Paul Donnelley (Wharncliffe Books, 2000) =Parks case= In 1987, Kenneth James Parks was a married 23-year-old Canadian man with a 5-month-old daughter. He had a very close relationship to his in-laws, with his 42-year- old mother-in-law, Barbara Ann Woods, referring to him as \\"her gentle giant.\\" The summer before the controversial events, he developed a gambling problem and fell into deep financial problems. To cover his losses, he took funds from his family's savings and then began to embezzle at work. Eventually, in March 1987, his actions were discovered, and he was fired from his job. On May 20, he went to his first Gamblers Anonymous meeting. He made plans to tell his grandmother the following Saturday (May 23) and his in-laws on Sunday (May 24) about his gambling problems and financial difficulties. Early on the morning of May 24, 1987, Kenneth Parks drove 20 kilometers from Pickering, Ontario to the house of his in-laws in Scarborough, Ontario. He entered their house with a key they had previously given him and used a tire iron to bludgeon his mother-in-law to death. He then turned on his father-in-law, attempting to choke him to death, but the man managed to survive the attack. He got back in his car and, despite being covered with blood, drove straight to a nearby police station and confessed, turning himself in, stating, \\"I think I have just killed two people.\\" Parks' only defense was that he was asleep during the entire incident and was not aware of what he was doing. Naturally, nobody believed it; even sleep specialists were extremely skeptical. However, after careful investigation, the specialists could find no other explanation. Parks‚Äô EEG readings were highly irregular, even for a parasomniac. This, combined with the facts that there was no motive, that he was amazingly consistent in his stories for more than seven interviews despite repeated attempts of trying to lead him astray, that the timing of the events fit perfectly with the proposed explanation, and that there is no way to falsify EEG results, led to a jury acquitting Parks of the murder of his mother-in-law and the attempted murder of his father-in-law. The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the acquittal in the 1992 decision R v Parks.Broughton et al. Homicidal Somnambulism: A Case Report. Sleep (1994); 17(3):253-64 Some doctors believe Parks should have been found to be not guilty by reason of insanity instead. =Falater case= Scott Falater, a resident of Phoenix, Arizona was accused of murdering his wife, Yarmila, by stabbing her 44 times on the night of January 16, 1997. According to an eyewitness, Falater was also seen holding his wife's head underwater. When he was tried, the prosecution claimed that after the murder had been committed, Falater changed his clothes, put the murder weapon in a Tupperware container, put the container in a trash bag with his boots and socks, and then stashed the bag in the spare tire well in the trunk of his car. Prosecutors testified that Falater's actions were \\"too complex\\" to have been carried out while sleepwalking. In June 1999, Scott Falater was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Martin, Lawrence. Can sleepwalking be a murder defense? 26 Apr. 2008. .. =Nieto case= Antonio Nieto, 58, a resident of M√°laga, Spain murdered his wife and mother in law using an axe and a hammer on January 11, 2001. Nieto's daughter suffered a jaw fracture but was left alone after feigning death, and his son disarmed him after receiving a cut on the ear. Nieto claimed to have been asleep during the attack and dreaming that he was defending himself against aggressive ostriches. However, his children stated that he had recognized them and had even told his son to not turn on the lights because their mother (gravely injured already) was sleeping. In 2007 Nieto (already under psychiatric treatment) was sentenced to 10 years internment in a psychiatric hospital and ordered to pay 171,100 euros as compensation to the victims.Resolved to intern 10 years the man that killed his wife and mother in law believing they were ostriches. (Spanish) .. =Lowe case= On October 30, 2004, the body of 83-year-old Edward Lowe was found on his driveway in Manchester, England. His son, Jules, admitted that he caused his father's death, but did not remember committing the act and used \\"automatism\\" as his defense. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and detained at Her Majesty's pleasure (that is, indefinitely) in a secure hospital. He was released after ten months. = Brian Thomas case = Brian Thomas, 59, who suffered from automatism and sleepwalking since he was a child, confessed to strangling his 57-year old wife, Christine in July 2008 in their camper van while on vacation. He called emergency services, and was heard telling the operator, \\"What have I done? I've been trying to wake her. I think I've killed my wife. Oh my God. I thought someone had broken in. I was fighting with those boys but it was Christine. I must have been dreaming or something. What have I done?...\\" He claimed he had mistaken his wife for an intruder, waking up to find it was his wife. He was freed in 2009 by a judge, who found him not guilty of murder.  In fiction  =Television depictions= In the first season of the Perry Mason TV series, one episode was titled \\"The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece.\\" The episode \\"Dreamcatchers,\\" in the fifth season of the TV series Teen Wolf, dealt with this. In the episode of Criminal Minds titled \\"In the Dark,\\" a serial killer suffers from this illness, killing multiple people during the night. =Movie depictions= The 1920 German horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari centers upon a series of murders committed by a somnambulist under control of the eponymous Dr. Caligari. The 1932 American gentlemen jewel thief romantic heist comedy Arsene Lupin features numerous depictions of somnambulism, specifically sleepwalking both real and faked by various characters. The 1971 Italian thriller A Lizard in a Woman's Skin involves a woman who thinks she may have murdered a neighbor in her sleep. The 1997 TV movie The Sleepwalker Killing depicts a story in which a man kills his mother-in-law and wounds his father-in-law in the middle of the night, then turns himself in. The 2010 thriller In My Sleep depicts a character who believes he may have murdered a good friend while sleepwalking. The movie was inspired by real life cases. The 2013 thriller Side Effects focuses on a woman who allegedly kills her husband while sleepwalking due to a side effect of the medication she is taking.

She was launched on 9 December 1915 and was commissioned on 9 January 1916. E24 was a mine-laying submarine. E24 was mined off Heligoland Bight on 24 March 1916. A salvage operation was attempted in 1973 as she was believed to be a German U-boat. Design Like all post-E8 British E-class submarines, E24 had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of and a beam length of . She was powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989).

British E-class submarines had fuel capacities of of diesel and ranges of when travelling at . E20 was capable of operating submerged for five hours when travelling at . E24 was armed with a 2-pounder deck gun, mounted forward of the conning tower. She had five 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, two in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of 10 torpedoes were carried.Barrow Submariners Association. RN Subs - E24 E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Some submarines contained Fessenden oscillator systems. Crew Her complement was three officers and 28 men. Loss E24 belonged to the Harwich-based 9th Flotilla at the time of her loss. She was the second E-class boat to be converted into a minelayer. E24 left Harwich on the morning of 21 March 1916 to lay mines in the Heligoland Bight. A positional report was issued late that night. Her commander, Lieutenant-Commander Naper, was ordered to enter the Bight in darkness on the surface via the Amrum Bank. Once in position he was to lay mines in a zigzag formation. As mines were known to have been laid by the Germans off Ameland, Naper was ordered to return by the same route. She did not return from the mission, and was logged as missing on 24 March 1916. Salvage Monument to the crew of E24 at Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery Divers hunting for a Second World War-era U-boat in 1973 raised sections of a mined submarine wreck, including the conning tower. The boat was towed to Cuxhaven where the wreck was identified as a British E-class boat, rather than a German submarine. The German government then informed the Admiralty. Human remains found in the wreck are buried in Ohlsdorf Cemetery, Hamburg. E24s commander is buried in a separate grave to others. Lieutenant- Commander Naper was identified because of the 2+half rings on sleeve, and the fact that his skeleton was 6 ft tall. All the skulls of those in the boat were found in a pyramidal formation. The sunken wreck lay at a downward angle, causing the heads to become detached from the bodies and to roll down the slope into that position. Three bodies were found lying under the battery boards directly on top of the batteries, with arms folded. They may have died of the effects of chlorine gas before the rest of the crew. Artefacts from E24 and her crew, such as smoking pipes belonging to Naper, a bottle of blackberries, the sextant, a firing pistol and boots are on display at Cuxhaven, as are the submarine's conning tower and propellers.

Background By the early nineteenth century, the ancient remedy of deodands had largely fallen into desuetude. However, during the 1830s the rapid development of the railways led to increasing public hostility to the epidemic of railway deaths and the indifferent attitudes of the railway companies. Under the common law of England and Wales, the death of a person causes purely emotional and pure economic loss to their relatives. In general, damages cannot be recovered for either type of damage, only for physical damage to the claimant or their property, and families of fatal accident victims had no claim. This was the rule declared by the court in Baker v. Bolton (1808).(1808) 1 Camp 493. As a result, coroners' juries started to award deodands as a way of penalising the railways. The railway accident at Sonning Cutting (1841) was a particularly notorious example, in which deodands of ¬£1,100 (equivalent to ¬£92,000 in 2016) in total were made on the engine (Hecla), and the trucks.Kostal (1994) pp. 289‚Äì290. This alerted legislators, in particular Lord Campbell and the Select committee on Railway Labourers (1846).Cornish & Clarke (1989) pp. 503‚Äì504. In the face of railway opposition, Campbell introduced a bill in 1845 that would lead to the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, Lord Campbell's Act, along with a bill to abolish deodands. The latter proposal, which became law as the Deodands Act 1846, to some extent mitigated railway hostility.

The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.Our History , Mead Johnson & Company.

Deformations of group Hopf algebras are foundational in the theory of quantum groups. Definition Let G be a group and k a field. The group Hopf algebra of G over k, denoted kG (or k[G]), is as a set (and a vector space) the free vector space on G over k. As an algebra, its product is defined by linear extension of the group composition in G, with multiplicative unit the identity in G; this product is also known as convolution. Note that while the group algebra of a finite group can be identified with the space of functions on the group, for an infinite group these are different. The group algebra, consisting of finite sums, corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for cofinitely many points; topologically (using the discrete topology), these correspond to functions with compact support. However, the group algebra k[G] and the space of functions k^G:= operatorname{Hom}(G,k) are dual: given an element of the group algebra x = sum_{gin G} a_g g and a function on the group fcolon G to k, these pair to give an element of k via (x,f) = sum_{gin G} a_g f(g), which is a well-defined sum because it is finite. Hopf algebra structure We give kG the structure of a cocommutative Hopf algebra by defining the coproduct, counit, and antipode to be the linear extensions of the following maps defined on G: :Delta(x) = x otimes x; :epsilon(x) = 1_{k}; :S(x) = x^{-1}. The required Hopf algebra compatibility axioms are easily checked. Notice that mathcal{G}(kG), the set of group-like elements of kG (i.e. elements a in kG such that Delta(a) = a otimes a and epsilon(a)=1), is precisely G. Symmetries of group actions Let G be a group and X a topological space. Any action alphacolon G times X to X of G on X gives a homomorphism phi_alphacolon G to mathrm{Aut}(F(X)), where F(X) is an appropriate algebra of k-valued functions, such as the Gelfand-Naimark algebra C_0(X) of continuous functions vanishing at infinity. The homomorphism phi_{alpha} is defined by phi_alpha(g) = alpha^*_g, with the adjoint alpha^*_{g} defined by :alpha^*_g(f)x = f(alpha(g,x)) for g in G, f in F(X), and x in X. This may be described by a linear mapping :lambdacolon kG otimes F(X) to F(X) :lambda((c_1 g_1 + c_2 g_2 + cdots ) otimes f)(x) = c_1 f(g_1 cdot x) + c_2 f(g_2 cdot x) + cdots where c_1,c_2,ldots in k, g_1, g_2,ldots are the elements of G, and g_i cdot x := alpha(g_i,x), which has the property that group-like elements in kG give rise to automorphisms of F(X). lambda endows F(X) with an important extra structure, described below. Hopf module algebras and the Hopf smash product Let H be a Hopf algebra. A (left) Hopf H-module algebra A is an algebra which is a (left) module over the algebra H such that h cdot 1_A = epsilon(h)1_A and :h cdot (ab) = (h_{(1)} cdot a)(h_{(2)} cdot b) whenever a, b in A, h in H and Delta(h) = h_{(1)} otimes h_{(2)} in sumless Sweedler notation. When lambda has been defined as in the previous section, this turns F(X) into a left Hopf kG-module algebra, which allows the following construction. Let H be a Hopf algebra and A a left Hopf H-module algebra. The smash product algebra Amathop{#} H is the vector space A otimes H with the product :(a otimes h)(b otimes k) := a(h_{(1)} cdot b) otimes h_{(2)}k, and we write amathop{#} h for a otimes h in this context. In our case, A = F(X) and H = kG, and we have :(amathop{#} g_1)(bmathop{#} g_2) = a(g_1 cdot b)mathop{#} g_1 g_2. In this case the smash product algebra Amathop{#} kG is also denoted by Amathop{#} G. The cyclic homology of Hopf smash products has been computed. However, there the smash product is called a crossed product and denoted A rtimes H not to be confused with the crossed product derived from C^{*}-dynamical systems.Gracia- Bondia, J. et al.

An individual family Oxyporaceae was described for the genus. A number of species in this genus are plant pathogens, causing a white rot. The genus is widely distributed. Taxonomy Oxyporus was first classified as a section of the genus Coriolus by Hubert Bourdot & Am√©d√©e Galzin in 1925. Marinus Anton Donk promoted the section to generic status in 1933. Boudiera, a genus proposed by L√°zaro Ibiza in 1917, is a synonym. The type species is Oxyporus populinus. Description The fruit bodies of Oxyporus species can exist in either a pileate (with cap and stipe) form, or a resupinate form (like a crust on the surface of the substrate). In the latter case, the crust is typically broadly attached to the substrate and has a fibrous to woody texture. Pileate fruit bodies are white to deep cream in color, have a velvety texture, and are frequently covered with mosses. The pore surface is white to light yellowish, with pores that are small and isodiametric, rarely large and angular. The tube layer is single or divided into distant layers, in which case it has layers of tissue between the tube layers. The flesh is white to cream. The hyphal system is monomitic; the generative hyphae are thin to thick-walled and sparingly branched. Most species have and abundance of simple septate cystidia that are encrusted at the tip. Basidiospores are spherical to broadly ellipsoid, thin- to thick-walled, smooth, hyaline, and have a negative reaction to Melzer's reagent. Species of Oxyporus grow on both conifers and hardwoods, causing a white rot. Pathogenicity Oxyporus corticola has been isolated from the lymphocutaneous tissues of a beagle and a German Shepherd. The risk factors for infection with O. corticola are not yet known. Uses Oxyporus latemarginatus produces the industrially significant enzymes lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase (but not laccase), which are used in bioremediation, biopulping, and biobleaching. The fungus was investigated for its ability to degrade lignin in kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) chips. This species also produces an antifungal compound, 5-pentyl-2-furaldehyde, that inhibits the mycelial growth of Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, and Rhizoctonia solani by mycofumigation.

Researchers have been able to collect many of the Histiotus at human dwellings or around domestic animals, due to the significant increase in human activity in the Paraguayan Chaco over the last 20 years. Habitat Histiotus is found in the tropical and temperate zones in South America. Their natural habitat ranges from areas with rocky mountains, to woods in Paraguay, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Chile.http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnat/v78n2/art05.pdf Only Histiotus macrotus is specifically found in the Dry Chaco region, which is part of the Gran Chaco region. A strong significant correlation, was found by researchers for the distribution of Histiotus related to the composition of the vegetation in Paraguay. Behavior =Echolocation and feeding= Histiotus are aerial feeders and use echolocation to catch prey. They can create echolocation calls dominated by frequencies below 20 Hz in order to catch prey. Histiotus diet consists of insects, specifically H. montanus mainly eats butterflies and Dipterans (fly). H. macrotus eats Dipterans and H. velatus eat moths.http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rbzool/v16n4/v16n4a17.pdf =Social systems= Most of the species are colonial and some are considered individual. Individual systems are considered for bats that interact as one or less than ten bats. Females of most temperate zone bats form maternity colonies during summer to communally raise pups. These colonies allow individuals to reduce heat loss by forming a cluster. This is called social thermoregulation. (For more on metabolism go to: Metabolism).Communally breeding bats use physiological and behavioural adjustments to optimise daily energy expenditure - Springer Flying adaptations Flight performance is determined by wing shape and ecological aspects such as foraging behavior (the way they search for food) and habitat selection. Research showed that H. montanus and H. macrotus have high maneuverability and low speed, which corresponds to bats that inhabit wooded areas. The high maneuverability or ability to quickly alter flight direction and speed is important for bats to successfully capture prey and avoid predators. Respiratory and cardiovascular adaptations Adaptation for flight involves many systems, and specifically cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Bats are considered as mammals adapted to extreme environments where oxygen management is crucial. Respiratory and cardiovascular systems undergo changes that allow the organism to optimize the acquisition and delivery of oxygen to tissues to be able to survive this extreme way of life. Research done on H.macrotus and H.montanus shows that they have the same respiratory strategy as other bats: \\"narrow- based high-keyed strategy.\\" This strategy includes: # larger heart and cardiac output # high hematocrit, high hemoglobin concentration and high blood oxygen transport capacity and # optimization of respiratory structural parameters. In other words, these bats are able to make the most effective use of their respiratory structure. Metabolism For bats, energy demands are particularly high during pregnancy or lactation. One way many bats are able to save energy is through the use of torpor, which is a controlled, substantial drop in metabolic rate and body temperature (metabolism). In addition to hibernation (prolonged torpor) during winter, temperate zone bats, such as Histiotus, often become torpid during periods of cold weather in summer (daily torpor) to save energy. By reducing metabolic rate, torpor prolongs gestation length and impairs lactation. This results in late births and slow juvenile growth rates. This reduces the probability for juveniles to survive their first winter, because not enough time has passed to store proper amounts of fat prior to hibernation. This is why females of most temperate zone bats, such as Histiotus, form maternity colonies during summer to communally raise pups. These colonies allow individuals to reduce heat loss by forming a cluster and therefore by their behavior they are able to improve insulation and this results in the conservation of energy.

Route description SR 104 begins in La Porte County at an all-way stop with SR 4 and County Road 300 South, a few miles southeast of the city of La Porte. The route heads southeast towards Walkerton, paralleling a Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad track . The road is two-lane rural highway, passing through farmland with some houses. SR 104 passes through the unincorporated community of Stillwell and crosses the Canadian National Railway. Southeast of Stillwell the highway drifts away from the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad track, for a short distance, before crossing the Kankakee River. After the river SR 104 passes between the southeast end of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad track and the north end of a Norfolk Southern rail track. SR 104 continues southeast now paralleling the Norfolk Southern track and enters St. Joseph County.

No segment of State Road 104 in Indiana that is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other state roads in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state roads as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2016, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 1,163 vehicles used the highway daily from at the La Port‚ÄìSt. Joseph county line. The peak traffic volumes were 1,698 vehicles used the highway daily at western end SR 104. History SR 104 was added to the state road system between 1942 and 1945, running along its current routing between SR 4 and US 6 in Walkerton. The entire roadway was paved between 1956 and 1959.

Since the London Olympics, heated clothing has also been used by athletes to keep their muscles warm between the warm-up and the race. Normal insulation works by trapping body heat, so if it gets wet from sweat or rain, or if a person stops exercising, the insulation may not keep them warm. With heated garments, a person can keep warm even if they are resting and not producing heat, or if their coat is damp from sweat. Types There are many types of heated clothing. Most notably these use 12, 7.4, and 5-volt powerbanks. The 5-volt powerbank allows one to use a common powerbank for both heating apparel and charging personal electronics. The 7.4-volt battery is the most common type of heated clothing battery system, and may be rechargeable. The most popular items sold have traditionally been heated gloves and jackets. 12-volt batteries are designed for use with motorcycles, ATVs, or snowmobiles, and draw their power from the vehicle's battery. As these use a higher voltage than 7.4v systems, they are more powerful and therefore heat a larger area at a higher temperature. Most brands using 12v systems are compatible. For instance, most 12v heated jackets come with built-in power cords that come out at the wrists to power heated gloves/liners and out from the bottom to power heated pants/liners. The pants then have cords coming from the bottom of each leg to power socks/liners/insoles. Most 7.4v garments will power for around 2-8 hours depending on heat setting and outside conditions. Many jackets and vests can be powered for almost double this time with an extended-life battery, available separately. =By function= The most widely available types of heated clothing are products for the extremities; the hands and feet. These parts are the most likely to suffer frostbite or frostnip in severe cold. As such, many manufacturers make heated gloves, mittens, socks, and boot liners, which can be purchased at workers' supply stores (serving construction workers) and motor sports stores. Heated torso coverings like vests, jackets, or leggings are available from specialty retailers that cater to motorcyclists and downhill skiers. Related products are heated seat covers, throws, and seating pads. Heated seat covers for snowmobiles, motorcycles, and cars and heated throw blankets typically use electrical 12-volt heating elements. Heated seating pads for hunting, canoeing, and stadium use either have rechargeable batteries or use reheatable gel packs. In a joint project of adidas, British Cycling and Loughborough University's Environmental Ergonomics Research Centre, the use of heated clothing for reducing the muscle temperature drop in athletes between their warm-up period and the actual race was investigated, and the 'adidas hot pants' were used by the track cycling team at the London Olympics with great success. The science behind this has been published in a series of papers by Faulkner et al., Wilkins and Havenith, and Raccuglia et al. =Technology= Electrical Heated clothing designed for use on vehicles such as motorbikes or snowmobiling typically use a 12-volt electric current, the standard voltage on motorsport and powersport batteries. While a single heated garment, such as heated gloves, will not usually adversely affect the charge on the battery, riders have to be careful about attaching several heated garments because the battery may not be able to handle the load. The heated garments are usually attached directly onto the battery of the bike. Some heated garments have cigarette lighter plugs. While the least expensive models can only be turned on or off, more expensive models sometimes provide a heating level control. For downhill skiing or winter biking, rechargeable nickel metal or lithium batteries are generally used. If not recharged properly, \\"battery memory\\" will shorten the battery's capability to recharge. There are two types of lithium batteries: Li-ion & Li-Polymer, which use several types of heating technologies including copper wire, nichrome wire, metal \\"mesh\\" systems, carbon-embedded fabric, carbon fibers and very thin flexible heating technologies that can be printed onto substrate. This has allowed for extra features to be added such as temperature sensors, Bluetooth integration and the ability to control the temperature from a smartphone.The carbon fibre heated clothing uses strips or tubular heating elements spaced across the heating areas of the jacket. These elements are flexible, to allow the user normal movement. The most reliable systems have technologies that have redundancy in case of a heating element breakage. The controller and battery in some models can be detached so that the garment can be worn as a regular garment. Stored heat Garments that use gel have cloth pouches or pockets where plastic packages of the gel can be inserted in the garment. Prior to going outdoors, the gel is heated in a microwave. Once outdoors, the gel pack retains its heat for 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the size of the gel pack, the thickness of the insulation protecting the gel pack from the outdoor temperatures, and wind conditions. Chemical Chemical reaction-based garments have cloth pouches or pockets, where single- use packages of chemical hand warmers can be inserted. The warmers are about the size of a package of cards, and they contain chemicals which produce heat. One traditional hand warmer is a small metal box containing charcoal which, when lit, burns very slowly and produces a mild heat. Disposable heat packs typically contain cellulose, iron, water, activated carbon, vermiculite, and salt. When these packs are exposed to air, an exothermic chemical reaction occurs, which provides several hours of heat. Another chemical heating pad uses a gel that can be activated by twisting the package, thus triggering a chemical reaction. The pack can be put in a pot of boiling water to convert the chemical reaction back and allow it to be reused. While these products are commonly called \\"hand warmers\\", they can be placed in boots or, with special garments such as vests, in cloth pockets on the inside of the garment. The warmth produced by these tends to be lowest among the above heating methods.

These kingfishers are found from South East Asia to the Solomon Islands. The genus was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in 1799. The type species is the oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithraca). A molecular phylogenetic study of the alcedinine kingfishers published in 2007 found that the genera as then defined did not form monophyletic groups. The species were subsequently rearranged into four monophyletic genera. The little kingfisher, azure kingfisher, Bismarck kingfisher, silvery kingfisher and Indigo-banded kingfisher were moved from Alcedo to Ceyx. All except one of the birds in the reconstituted genus have three rather than the usual four toes. The exception is the Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher which retains a vestigial fourth toe. The Moluccan dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx lepidus) was previous named the variable dwarf kingfisher and included 15 recognised subspecies. A genetic study published in 2013 found that most of the subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The species was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies were promoted to species status. At the same time the name was changed from the variable dwarf kingfisher to the Moluccan dwarf kingfisher. The two African species in the genus Ispidina were sometimes placed in this genus. Compared to the related species in the genus Alcedo they are more terrestrial.

She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone.  Built in Houston, Texas  Zaurak (AK-117) was laid down on 7 October 1943 at Houston, Texas, by the Todd-Houston Shipbuilding Corp. under a Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 1964) as SS Hugh Young; renamed Zaurak on 13 November 1943; launched on 18 November 1943; sponsored by Miss Betsy Colston Young; delivered to the Navy on 27 November; moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she underwent conversion for naval use at the Todd Johnson yard; and commissioned on 17 March 1944, Lt. Cmdr. John S. Kapuscinski, USNR, in command. World War II Pacific Theatre operations The new cargo ship departed New Orleans on 5 April and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on the 13th. After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay, she loaded cargo, provisions, and stores at Norfolk and embarked passengers for a voyage to the South Pacific. She stood out of the Chesapeake Bay on 3 May, bound for New York, whence she departed on the 5th. =Transiting the Panama Canal= After a stop at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, she transited the Panama Canal on 19 May and headed independently toward Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides islands. Almost a month later, on 14 June, she steamed into Segond Channel. The ship disembarked passengers immediately but remained at Espiritu Santo for three weeks, during which time American forces invaded the Mariana Islands. =Supporting the Saipan invasion forces= On 2 July, Zaurak departed Espiritu Santo to steam via Noum√©a, New Caledonia, to Eniwetok and thence to join in the Marianas campaign. She arrived at Eniwetok on the 18th and departed there three days later with a convoy bound for Saipan. She arrived in the anchorage between Saipan and Tinian on 25 July and remained there for 17 days. On 9 August, she embarked 812 battle-weary officers and men of the Army's 27th Infantry Division and, two days later, departed the Marianas bound, via Eniwetok, for Espiritu Santo. The cargo ship arrived back in Segond Channel on 24 August and disembarked her passengers. =Supporting the invasion of the Philippines= For the next two months, Zaurak made a series of voyages between various islands in the Southwestern Pacific, visiting several of the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Emirau, Manus, and New Caledonia. On 23 October, she departed Bougainville in the Solomons with a convoy of 31 ships bound for the Philippines with reinforcements and supplies for the forces that had just invaded Leyte. She steamed into Leyte Gulf at the head of the convoy on 29 October and anchored in San Pedro Bay. =Under attack by Japanese aircraft= During her 11 days there, Zaurak received her baptism of fire. Initially, conditions in the San Pedro Bay anchorage were quiet enough; but, when she moved to the San Juanico Strait anchorage on the 31st, enemy air activity‚Äîoccasioned by the proximity of Tacloban airfield‚Äîrose markedly. On 1 and 2 November, she fired her first shots at enemy planes attacking the airstrip ashore but, due to darkness and extreme range, scored no hits. On the 3d and 4th, Japanese began attacking the ships in the anchorage as secondary targets. =Zaurak shoots down attacking plane= The ship claimed her first enemy plane on the latter morning when a plane attacking the airfield veered out of a searchlight beam and away from shore-based anti-aircraft fire to attack the ships in the anchorage. Zaurak's secondary battery opened fire, but the plane flew right through her field of fire to crash into in the vicinity of that merchant ship's number 1 hatch. Almost immediately, volunteers from Zaurak went to the stricken merchantman's aid, rescuing over 20 men from the water around the blazing ship. A little later that same morning, another Japanese plane ran afoul of Zaurak's guns and fell in flames into the water. Soon thereafter, two more intruders approached the ship but never came close enough to become a good target. Though she claimed hits on both, neither plane went down. =Departing the Philippine area= During her final five days at Leyte, she experienced several more air attacks, but her guns downed no more planes. On 8 November, the ship had to get underway to ride out a heavy tropical storm which approached in typhoon force. The following day, Zaurak embarked passengers and departed Leyte Gulf in a convoy of 20 ships, bound for Hollandia, New Guinea. =Delivering troops to the attack on Iwo Jima= After three months of voyages between such places as Guadalcanal, Espiritu Santo, New Caledonia, Bougainville, Green Island, Oro Bay, and Finschhafen, she voyaged to Munda in March 1945 to embark reinforcements for the Iwo Jima operation then in progress. She delivered elements of the 147th Infantry to Iwo Jima on 29 March and remained there for a week, embarking units of the 3rd Marine Division on the 27th. =Transporting U.S. Marines to Guam and Okinawa= Two days later, she sailed from the Marshalls and, on 1 April, arrived at Guam where the marines disembarked. From there, she headed for Pavuvu in the Solomons, where she embarked Marine Corps and Navy men for passage back to Hawaii. Upon her arrival in Pearl Harbor on 3 May, she learned that most of the marines embarked were needed at Okinawa. She therefore departed Oahu on 6 May and set a course via Eniwetok and Ulithi for the Ry≈´ky≈´s. She arrived off Okinawa on 13 June and remained there for six days disembarking troops and unloading cargo. On 19 June, she got underway for Ulithi, on the first leg of the voyage back to the United States. After additional stops at Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Seattle, Washington, on 10 August. Three days later, she entered the Todd Shipyard for her first major overhaul. =End-of-war activity= While she was in the yard, Japan capitulated. Zaurak's repairs were completed in mid- September; and, after embarking passengers, the ship departed Seattle on 21 September. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and Ulithi, she arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 25 October. From there, she moved to Shanghai, China, where she traded replacement troops for men returning home to the United States. From there, she proceeded to Jinsen, Korea, to make a similar personnel trade. Following that, the ship made a stop at Taku in North China and a return visit to Shanghai before getting underway on 1 December to return home. Following a non-stop voyage across the expanse of the Pacific, Zaurak entered San Francisco Bay on 20 December. Post-war decommissioning She remained at San Francisco until decommissioned on 12 March 1946.

The film is a moving insight into the squalor and poverty of inner-city life in the Philippines. As a tragic tale, it covers a whole plethora of emotions surrounding the lives of some of the poorest people in Manila portrayed in the film. Plot Basilio (Kristoffer King) escapes provincial Leyte to the slums of Manila with his younger brother Buboy (Alcris Galura). Residing in the shanty town tenements beneath the tourist-infested breakwater and seawalls of the city, Basilio falls in love with a prostitute named Paquita (Katherine Luna). Paquita started whoring early in life that at her relatively young age she's already \\"played out\\", her body full of sexual diseases and open sores. But their relationship is troubled only by the apparent poverty and the more impending threat of the slums' jealous protector, ex-cop Dave (Gardo Versoza).

The episode was written by Michael Green and was directed by Allan Arkush. It originally aired on October 1, 2007. Plot The Irish criminals who found Peter Petrelli shackled inside a cargo container are holding him captive. They violently interrogate him about the missing cargo (a shipment of iPods). Caitlin, the sister of Ricky, the leader of the criminal gang, tends to Peter, who is still unable to remember even his name. Bob, the representative of the Company who hired Mohinder Suresh, sends Mohinder on an assignment, which turns out to be a mission to heal the Haitian. Maya and Alejandro are struggling to get across the border, and are assisted by a woman named Nidia, a family friend. At her house, an unnamed healer tells her that no one can cure her disease, and that her curse is dark enough to kill the Devil himself. Matt Parkman and Detective Fuller visit the roof of the Deveaux Building to investigate Kaito Nakamura's death, and learn that Angela Petrelli was present. Ando explains to Parkman that the helix symbol scrawled on the photograph of Kaito means \\"Godsend.\\" Parkman and the detective interview Mrs. Petrelli, who alludes to a prior sexual relationship with Kaito. She then realizes that Parkman is reading her thoughts, and mentally demands that he get out of her head. Parkman greets Nathan Petrelli, who has arrived to post his mother's bail. As the two walk to the locked interrogation room to retrieve Mrs. Petrelli, she is apparently attacked by an unseen force. Parkman breaks in, but she is alone in the room, with blood on her face. In her hand is the picture of her with the helix symbol scrawled across it. Hiro Nakamura, still in Japan in 1671, impersonates his hero, Takezo Kensei, in order to correct history. He uses his power to stop time and disarms 11 bandits, rescuing the swordsmith's daughter. As they converse, she expresses her gratitude. Kensei, persuaded by Hiro's pleas -- and the prospect of a relationship with the swordsmith's daughter -- agrees to rescue the swordsmith, but is ambushed by the bandits Hiro earlier disarmed. Kensei appears to be killed by the bandits' arrows, but is somehow able to revive: his wounds heal while Hiro watches, amazed. Claire Bennet, curious about the limits of her abilities, cuts off her little toe to see if it will grow back, which it does, but she discovers that West (who had been watching through her window) has seen the incident. She tries to pursue him, only to find him gone and Chandra Suresh's book lying on her driveway. The episode ends with her mother's dog, Mr. Muggles, barking at the sky. Critical reception On the episode's original airdate, Heroes attracted 11.9 million viewers. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C.
