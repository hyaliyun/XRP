The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco‚ÄìSpanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War. The war established the House of Braganza as Portugal's new ruling dynasty, replacing the Spanish Habsburg who had ruled the country since 1581. Events leading to revolution Philip II & III of Portugal and Spain. When Philip II of Portugal (Philip III of Spain) died, he was succeeded by his son Philip III, who had a different approach to Portuguese issues. Taxes on the Portuguese merchants were raised, the Portuguese nobility began to lose its influence at the Spanish Cortes, and government posts in Portugal were increasingly occupied by Spaniards. Ultimately, Philip III tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles stood to lose all of their power. Moreover, being under Spanish rule entangled Portugal in Spain's Eighty Years' War with the resurgent Dutch Republic. Specifically, the Portuguese colonies being under the Spanish Crown gave the Dutch a pretext to embark on systematically attacking and conquering them in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War - and the Portuguese felt great resentment at what they perceived as Spain prioritizing its own colonies and neglecting the defense of the Portuguese ones. This situation culminated in a revolution organized by the nobility and bourgeoisie, executed on 1 December 1640, sixty years after the crowning of Philip I (Philip II of Spain), the first \\"dual monarch\\". The plot was planned by Ant√£o Vaz de Almada, Miguel de Almeida, and Jo√£o Pinto Ribeiro. They, together with several associates, known as the Forty Conspirators, killed the Secretary of State, Miguel de Vasconcelos, and imprisoned the king's cousin, Margaret of Savoy, who had been governing Portugal in his name. The moment was well chosen; Philip's troops were, at the time, fighting the Thirty Years' War and also facing a revolution in Catalonia which became known as the Reapers' War. The support of the people became apparent almost immediately, and, within a matter of hours, Philip III's 6th cousin John, 8th Duke of Braganza was acclaimed as King John IV of Portugal; the news spread like wildfire throughout the country. By 2 December 1640, the day following the coup, John IV, acting in his capacity as sovereign of the country, had already sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of √âvora. The ensuing conflict with Spain brought Portugal into the Thirty Years' War as, at least, a peripheral player. From 1641 to 1668, the period during which the two nations were at war, Spain sought to isolate Portugal militarily and diplomatically, and Portugal tried to find the resources to maintain its independence through political alliances and maintenance of its colonial income. Preparations for war Immediately after assuming the Portuguese throne, Jo√£o IV took several steps to strengthen his position. On 11 December 1640, a 'Council of War' was created to organize all of the operations. Next, the king created the 'Junta of the Frontiers' to take care of the fortresses near the border, the hypothetical defense of Lisbon, and the garrisons and sea ports. A year later, in December 1641, he created a tenancy to assure that all of the country's fortresses would be upgraded and that the improvements would be financed with regional taxes. Jo√£o IV also organized the army, re-established the 'Military Laws of King Sebastian', and undertook a diplomatic campaign focused on restoring good relations with England. After gaining several small victories, Jo√£o tried to make peace quickly. However, his demand that Philip recognize the new ruling dynasty in Portugal was not fulfilled until the reign of his son, Afonso VI, during the regency of Peter of Braganza (another of his sons who later became King Peter II of Portugal.) Confrontations with Spain lasted twenty-eight years. Context: relations among the European powers John II, Duke of Braganza waged the Restoration War and was acclaimed King John IV. Relations between France and Spain In 1640, Cardinal Richelieu, the chief adviser to Louis XIII of France, was fully aware of the fact that France was operating under strained circumstances. Louis was at war with Spain at that time; he had to control rebellions within France that were supported and financed by Madrid; and he had to send French armies to fight the Spanish Habsburgs on three different fronts. In addition to their shared frontier at the Pyrenees, Philip IV of Spain, formerly Philip III of Portugal as well, reigned, under various titles, in Flanders and the Franche-Comt√©, to the north and east of France. In addition, Philip IV controlled large territories in Italy, where he could, at will, impose a fourth front by attacking French-controlled Savoy. (In Savoy, Christine Marie of France was acting as regent on behalf of her young son, Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy.) Spain had enjoyed the reputation of having the most formidable military force in Europe, with the introduction of the arquebus and the so-called \\"Spanish School\\". This reputation and tactic had however diminished with the Thirty Years' War. Nevertheless, the consummate statesman, Richelieu, decided to force Philip IV to look to his own internal problems. In order to divert the Spanish troops besieging France, Louis XIII, on the advice of Richelieu, supported the claim of Jo√£o IV of Portugal during the Acclamation War. This was done on the reasoning that a Portuguese war would drain Spanish resources and manpower. Relations between Portugal and France To fulfill the common foreign- policy interests of Portugal and France, a treaty of alliance between the two countries was concluded at Paris on 1 June 1641. It lasted eighteen years before Richelieu's successor as unofficial foreign minister, Cardinal Mazarin, broke the treaty and abandoned his Portuguese and Catalan allies to sign a separate peace with Madrid. The Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed in 1659, under the terms of which France received the portion of Catalonia north of the Pyrenees, known as the Roussillon, and part of the Cerdanya (French Cerdagne). Most important to the Portuguese, the French recognised Philip IV of Spain as the legitimate king of Portugal. Seven years later, in the late stages of the Portuguese Restoration War, relations between the two countries thawed to the extent that the young (but sickly) Afonso VI of Portugal married a French princess, Marie Fran√ßoise of Nemours. Relations between Portugal and the Dutch Republic Catherine of Braganza, Queen Consort of England, Scotland, and Ireland. At the time of the revolution in Lisbon (1 December 1640), the Portuguese had been at war with the Dutch for nearly forty years. A good deal of the conflict can be attributed to the fact that Spain and the Dutch Republic were concurrently engaged in the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648), and, ever since hostilities between Portugal and the Dutch Republic erupted in 1602, Portugal had been ruled by a Spanish monarch. The Dutch-Portuguese War was fought almost entirely overseas, with the Dutch mercantile surrogates, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, repeatedly attacking Portugal's colonial possessions in the Americas, in Africa, in India, and in the Far East. Portugal was in a defensive posture throughout, and it received very little military help from Spain. After the acclamation of Jo√£o IV, this pattern persisted all over the Portuguese Empire until the final expulsion of the Dutch from Angola (1648), S√£o Tom√© (1649), and Brazil (1654). The Dutch signed a European truce with Portugal, helping each other somewhat against their common enemy, Spain. The Dutch resumed buying salt in the Set√∫bal salt factories, restarting commerce between the two countries for the first time since 1580, when the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs, against whom the Dutch were in revolt, had assumed the Portuguese throne. However, Dutch attacks on Portuguese territories persisted until 1663, even after the signing of the Treaty of The Hague in 1661. Relations between Portugal and England England was, at this time, embroiled in its own civil war. Portuguese problems in dealing with England arose from the fact that the English Parliament fought and won its anti-royalist war while, at the same time, Portugal's royal court continued to receive and recognize English princes and nobles. These strained relations persisted during the short-lived Commonwealth period, when the republican government that had deposed Charles I ruled England and then Ireland and Scotland. After the restoration of the Stuart dynasty, it became possible for Portugal to compensate for the lack of French support by renewing its alliance with England. This took the form of a dynastic marriage between Charles II and Afonso VI's sister, Catherine of Braganza, which assured Portugal of outside support in its conflict with Spain. The English alliance helped peace with Spain, since Spain had been drained by the Thirty Years' War, and it had no stomach for further warfare with other European powers, especially a resurgent England. War Militarily, the Portuguese Restoration War consisted mainly of border skirmishes and cavalry raids to sack border towns, combined with occasional invasions and counter-invasions, many of them half-hearted and under-financed. There were only five major set-piece battles during twenty-eight years of hostilities. The war may be considered to have had three periods: * first, an early stage (1640‚Äì1646) when a few major engagements demonstrated that the Portuguese could not be easily returned to submission to the Spanish Habsburgs; * second, a long period (1646‚Äì1660) of military standoffs, characterized by small-scale raiding, while Spain concentrated on its military commitments elsewhere in Europe; * third, a final period (1660‚Äì1668) during which the Spanish king, Philip IV, unsuccessfully sought a decisive victory that would bring an end to hostilities. First stage: battles Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, Marquis of Marialva, led victories at the Lines of Elvas. Hoping for a quick victory in Portugal, Spain immediately committed seven regiments to the Portuguese frontier, but delays by the Count of Monterrey, a commander with more interest in the comforts of life at camp than the battlefield, squandered any immediate advantage. A Portuguese counter-thrust in late 1641 failed, and the conflict soon settled into a stalemate. =Battle of Montijo= On 26 May 1644, a large column of Spanish troops and mercenaries, commanded by the Neapolitan marquis of Torrecusa, was stopped at the Battle of Montijo by the Portuguese, who were led by the Matias de Albuquerque, one of a number of experienced Portuguese colonial officers who rose to prominence during the war. =Atrocities= The war now took on a peculiar character. It became a frontier confrontation, often between local forces, neighbors who knew each other well, but this familiarity did not moderate the destructive and blood-thirsty impulses of either side. The wanton nature of the combat was often exacerbated by the use of mercenaries and foreign conscripts; incidents of singular cruelty were reported on both sides. The Portuguese settled old animosities that had festered during sixty years of Spanish domination, and the Spanish often took the view that their opponents were disloyal and rebellious subjects, not an opposing army entitled to respectful treatment under the rules of combat. =Scope of the war= Luisa de Guzm√°n, Queen Consort of Portugal, previously Duchess of Braganza. Three theaters of warfare were eventually opened, but most activity focused on the northern front, near Galicia, and on the central frontier between Portuguese Alentejo and Spanish Extremadura. The southern front, where the Portuguese Algarve abuts Spanish Andalusia, was a logical target for Portugal, but it was never the focus of a Portuguese attack, probably because the Portuguese queen, Luisa de Guzm√°n, was the sister of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the leading noble of Andalusia. =Attrition and corruption= Spain, at first, made the war a defensive one. Portugal, for its part, felt no need to take Spanish territory in order to win, and it too was willing to make the war a defensive contest. Campaigns typically consisted of correrias (cavalry raids) to burn fields, sack towns, and steal large herds of enemy cattle and sheep. Soldiers and officers, many of them mercenaries, were primarily interested in booty and prone to desertion. For long periods, without men or money, neither side mounted formal campaigns, and when actions were taken, they were often driven as much by political considerations, such as Portugal's need to impress potential allies, as by clear military objectives. Year after year, given the problems of campaigning in the winter, and the heat and dry conditions of summer, most of the serious fighting was confined to two relatively short \\"campaign seasons\\" in the spring and fall. The war settled into a pattern of mutual destruction. As early as December 1641, it was common to hear Spaniards throughout the country lament that \\"Extremadura is finished.\\" Tax collectors, recruiting officers, billeted soldiers, and depredations by Spanish and foreign troops were loathed and feared by the Spanish population as much as raids by the enemy. In Extremadura, local militias bore the brunt of the fighting until 1659, and the absence of these part-time soldiers was extremely harmful to agriculture and local finances. Since there was often no money to pay or support the troops (or to reward their commanders), the Spanish crown turned a blind eye to the smuggling, contraband, profiteering, disorder, and destruction that had become rampant on the frontier. Similar conditions also existed among the Portuguese. Second stage: defensive stand-off John of Austria was instrumental in leading the Habsburg forces. The war was also expensive. In the 1650s, there were over 20,000 Spanish troops in Extremadura alone, compared to 27,000 in Flanders. Between 1649 and 1654, about 29 percent (over six million ducats) of Spanish defence spending was appropriated for fighting Portugal, a figure that rose during the major campaigns of the 1660s. Portugal was able to finance its war effort because of its ability to tax the spice trade with Asia and the sugar trade from Brazil, and it received some support from the European opponents of Spain, particularly France and England. The 1650s were indecisive militarily but important on the political and diplomatic fronts, with the brief exception of the Battle of the Lines of Elvas in 1659. The death of Jo√£o IV in 1656 signalled the beginning of the regency of his wife, followed by a succession crisis and a palace coup (1662). Despite these domestic problems, the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazil (1654) and the signing of a treaty with England (also in 1654) improved Portugal's diplomatic and financial position temporarily and gave it needed protection against a naval raid on Lisbon. Nonetheless, the overriding goal, a formal pact with France continued to evade Portugal, whose weakness and isolation had been driven home by its virtual exclusion at the negotiations for the European settlement-of-settlements, the new realpolitik of the peace of Westphalia (1648). With this treaty and the end of hostilities in Catalonia in 1652, Spain was again ready to direct its efforts against Portugal, but it faced a lack of men, resources, and, especially, good military commanders. Third stage: Portuguese victory Frederico, Count of M√©rtola, who was in command of the English contingent brigade in Portugal By 1662, Spain had committed itself to a major effort to end the war. John of Austria the Younger, Philip IV's illegitimate son, led 14,000 men into Alentejo, and, the following year, they succeeded in taking √âvora, the major city of the region. The Portuguese, under Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquess of Marialva were bolstered by the arrival of a British brigade which numbered 3,000 in August 1662. Many were veterans of the English Civil War and the Dutch Revolt. For King Charles II, this was a convenient way of getting rid of demobilized soldiers of Cromwell's New Model Army and removing them from English territory. They were led by the German soldier of fortune, Friedrich Hermann von Sch√∂nberg, Count of M√©rtola, The brigade under Schomberg's leadership, proved a decisive factor in winning back Portugal's independence.Riley p. Backcover They defeated the Spanish in a major engagement at Ameixial on 8 June 1663, and this forced John of Austria to abandon √âvora and retreat across the border with heavy losses. The Portuguese now had some 30,000 troops in the Alentejo-Extremadura theater, but they could not draw the Spanish again into a major engagement until June 1665, when a new Spanish commander, the marquis of Caracena, took over Vila Vi√ßosa with about 23,000 men, including recruits from Germany and Italy. The Portuguese relief column under Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses and Schomberg met them at Montes Claros on 17 June 1665. The Portuguese infantry and artillery emplacements broke the Spanish cavalry, and the Spanish force lost over 10,000 men, including casualties and prisoners. Shortly thereafter, the Portuguese retook Vila Vi√ßosa. These were the last major engagements of the war. Both sides returned to skirmishing campaigns. Portugal, with the intercession of its English ally, had sought a truce, but after the decisive Portuguese victory at Montes Claros and with the signing of a Franco-Portuguese treaty in 1667, the Spanish Habsburgs finally agreed to recognize the House of Braganza as Portugal's new ruling dynasty on 13 February 1668. Recapitulation The five major battles of the war were: * Battle of Montijo on 26 May 1644 * Battle of the Lines of Elvas on 14 January 1659 * Battle of Ameixial on 8 June 1663 * Battle of Castelo Rodrigo on 7 July 1664 * Battle of Montes Claros on 17 June 1665 The Portuguese were victorious in almost all of these engagements, and peace was concluded, with the help of English mediation, by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. Timeline Margaret of Savoy, Vicereine of Portugal, Duchess of Mantua. Afonso VI of Portugal's reign was managed by the Count of Castelo Melhor. Philip III & IV of Portugal and Spain Prince Regent Pedro, Duke of Beja, future King Pedro II of Portugal. * 1640: A small group of conspirators stormed the royal palace in Lisbon and deposed the Vicereine of Portugal, Margaret of Savoy on 1 December 1640. She, famously, tried to calm the Portuguese people during demonstrations in the Terreiro do Pa√ßo, at the time, Lisbon's main square, but her efforts failed. The Duke of Bragan√ßa, head of the senior family among the Portuguese nobility, accepted the throne as Jo√£o IV of Portugal later the same day. Jo√£o IV's entire reign was dominated by the struggle to maintain Portuguese independence. * 1641: A counter-revolution mounted by the Inquisition failed. It was quelled by Francisco de Lucena, who had its leaders executed. Miguel Lu√≠s de Menezes, 2nd Duke of Caminha, was executed for continuing to support the Habsburgs' claim to the Portuguese throne. * 1641: Portugal signed alliances with France (1 June 1641) and Sweden (August 1641). * 1641: Portugal and the Dutch Republic signed a 'Treaty of Offensive and Defensive Alliance', otherwise known as the Treaty of The Hague, on 12 July 1641. The treaty was not respected by either party; as a consequence, it had no effect on the Portuguese dependencies of Brazil and Angola that were under Dutch occupation. * 1641: The Dutch began their occupation of S√£o Tom√© and of Ano Bom on 16 October 1641, where they remained until 6 January 1649. This was clearly a violation of the agreement made with Portugal only three months earlier. * 1641: Portugal was ousted from Malacca by the Dutch. * 1642: The Dutch took over all of the Portuguese Gold Coast (now Ghana). * 1643: At the Battle of Rocroi (19 May 1643), in the Ardennes, the French defeated the Spanish. * 1644: The Battle of Montijo near Badajoz, between the Portuguese and the Spanish, was fought on 26 May 1644. * 1644: The Portuguese city of Elvas withstood a nine-day siege by Spanish troops. * 1648: The Sultan of Oman, in alliance with the Dutch, captured Muscat, which had been a Portuguese trading outpost on the Arabian peninsula. * 1648: Portuguese troops from the colony of Brazil under Salvador Correia de S√° landed in Angola, retook Luanda, and expelled the Dutch, thereby restoring the African colony to Portugal. * 1649: The Dutch were ousted from S√£o Tom√©. * 1654: The Anglo-Portuguese treaty between Jo√£o IV and Oliver Cromwell was signed at Westminster. Jo√£o agreed to prevent the molestation of English traders in Portugal and its possessions; they were allowed to use their own bible and to bury their dead according to Protestant rites even though they were on Catholic soil. * 1654: Portuguese troops from the colony of Brazil drove the Dutch out of the great plantation colonies of northeastern Brazil, re-establishing the territorial integrity of Portugal's South American holdings. * 1656: Portugal lost control of Colombo in Portuguese Ceylon to the Dutch. * 1656: Jo√£o IV died on 6 November 1656 after a reign of fifteen years. His queen, who was born Luisa de Guzman (1613‚Äì1666), the eldest daughter of the Spanish grandee, the Duke of Medina-Sidonia, then reigned as regent for their son, Afonso VI of Portugal. She began seeking an accommodation with Spain. * 1658: The Dutch took Jaffnapatam, Portugal's last colony in Ceylon. * 1659: The Battle of the Lines of Elvas was fought on 14 January 1659. Portuguese troops, under the command of the marquis of Marialva, Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, and Sancho Manoel de Vilhena, scored a resounding victory over the Spanish. * 1659: The Spanish besieged the Portuguese town of Mon√ß√£o. The town fell on the 7th of February. * 1659: The Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed on 7 November 1659, ending Spain's long war with France, and Spanish troops were free once more to suppress the Portuguese 'rebellion'. The Spaniards besieged Elvas, and they were driven off by Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses once again. * 1660: Upon the restoration of Charles II in England, the Queen-Regent re-negotiated the treaty of 1654. Portugal was allowed to recruit soldiers and horses in England for the fight against Spain, to seek the conscription of four thousand mercenaries in Scotland and Ireland, and to charter twenty-four English ships to carry them. The expeditionary force was issued English weapons upon arrival in Portugal and guaranteed freedom of worship. * 1660: The English began to dominate the trade in port wine from Portugal after a political spat with the French denied them Bordeaux wines. Brandy was added to the Portuguese wines to fortify them for the Atlantic voyage. Together with the restoration of Charles II in England, the \\"port connection\\" had an increasingly positive influence on Anglo-Portuguese relations. * 1661: Bombay and Tangier were ceded to England on 23 June 1661 as a dowry for Afonso's sister, Catherine of Braganza, who had married King Charles II of England on 25 May 1661. In addition to the deeds to Bombay and Tangier, Catherine arrived in London, where she popularized the practice of drinking tea, with a dowry of two million gold pieces. Servicing this wedding debt burdened the Portuguese exchequer for the next half-century. The marriage with a Protestant monarch was deeply unpopular with those among the Portuguese nobility who favored alliance with France. An anglophile party and a francophile party developed at the Portuguese court. * 1661: English mediation induced the Netherlands to acknowledge, on 6 August 1661, Portuguese rule in Brazil, in return for uncontested control of Ceylon and eight million guilders. This agreement was formalized in the Treaty of The Hague (1661). * 1662: Shortly after Afonso VI's coming-of-age, Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor, saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the mentally deficient king. He managed to convince the king that his mother, Luisa of Medina-Sidonia, was plotting to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso asserted his right to rule and dispatched his mother to a convent. The king appointed Castelo Melhor his secret notary (escriv√£o da puridade), a position in which Castelo Melhor was able to exercise the functions of first minister. Because of the weakness of the king, Castelo Melhor became the virtual \\"dictator of Portugal\\". * 1662: Castelo Melhor commenced the final (successful) phase of the Portuguese Acclamation War with the aid of the Count of M√©rtola, who brilliantly commanded the international mercenary army that had been assembled with the assistance of England. * 1663: The Battle of Ameixial was fought on 8 June 1663. After they had spent nearly all spring overrunning the south of Portugal, the Spanish army, under John of Austria the Younger, took the Portuguese city of √âvora. Less than three weeks later, they were soundly defeated by Sancho Manoel de Vilhena and Count of M√©rtola. * 1663: The Dutch ousted the Portuguese from the Malabar coast, even though this was a clear violation of their 1661 treaty. * 1663: The Siege of √âvora occurred when the Portuguese army led by Sancho Manoel de Vilhena and by the Count of M√©rtola retook the city from the Spanish occupiers, with little to no casualties. The entire Spanish garrison surrendered. * 1664: The Battle of Castelo Rodrigo was fought on 7 July 1664. A regional military commander, Pedro Jacques de Magalh√£es, defeated the Duke of Osuna. * 1664: The Siege of Valencia de Alc√°ntara results in the successful conquest of the Spanish town of Valencia de Alc√°ntara by Portugal in July 1664. * 1665: Portugal was again victorious at the Battle of Montes Claros (on 17 June 1665), in which Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses and Schomberg defeated the Spanish army under the Marquis of Caracena; Spain ceased hostilities, but a true peace treaty was not signed for another three years. Montes Claros is considered one of the most important battles in Portuguese history. * 1666: In an attempt to establish an alliance with France, Castelo Melhor arranged for Afonso VI to marry Marie Fran√ßoise of Nemours, the daughter of the Duke of Nemours, but this marriage would not last long. * 1666: The ambitious Castelo Melhor planned to prosecute the war to the extent of taking Galicia and presenting it to the Portuguese crown as a war indemnity, but he was dissuaded. * 1667: Marie Fran√ßoise petitioned for an annulment of her marriage to Afonso VI, based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment. * 1667: King Afonso VI, Castelo Melhor, and his francophile party were overthrown by the king's younger brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (who later ruled as Pedro II of Portugal.) Pedro first installed himself as his brother's regent and then arranged Afonso's exile to the island of Terceira in the Azores on the pretense that he was incapable of governing. Castelo Melhor fled into exile; ironically, he chose to live in England. * 1667: The French alliance had been imperilled by the annulment of Afonso's marriage, but Pedro strengthened his political position by marrying his brother's estranged queen. * 1668: The Treaty of Lisbon with Spain ended twenty-eight years of war. The regent of Spain, Mariana of Austria, acting in the name of her young son Charles II of Spain, finally recognized the legitimacy of the Portuguese monarch. Portugal kept all of its remaining overseas colonies, with the exception of Ceuta on the north African coast, who didn't recognize the Bragan√ßa Dynasty during the war.Glenn Joseph Ames, Renascent empire?: the House of Braganza and the quest for stability in Portuguese monsoon Asia c.1640‚Äì1683, page 24 Results of the war For Portugal, its restoration of independence from Spain was clearly established, and it proved that it could fend for itself, albeit with difficulty. Its victories on the battlefield had re-awakened Portuguese nationalism. Economically, Portugal's restoration of independence freed it to pursue the course mapped out by the pioneers of commercial imperialism. During the seventeenth century, its economy depended largely upon entrep√¥t trade in tobacco and sugar, and the export of salt. During the eighteenth century, even though staples were not abandoned, the Portuguese economy came to be based more upon slaves, gold, leather, and wine. Portuguese trade, centered in the busy port of Lisbon, was most influenced by Anglo-Dutch capitalism and by the colonial economy in Brazil.The Making of Modern Europe, 1648‚Äì1780 Lu√≠s de Meneses, the Count of Ericeira, economic adviser to the prince regent, advocated the development of a native textile industry based on a Flemish model. Factories were established at Covilh√£, in an area of central Portugal where there was easy access to flocks of sheep and clean mountain water, but they were highly unpopular with both local consumers and traditional weavers. Meanwhile, Portuguese attempts to develop a silk industry were undercut by the French, who wanted to monopolize that market. More importantly, after 1668, Portugal, determined to differentiate itself from Spain, turned to Western Europe, particularly France and England, for new ideas and skills. This was part of a gradual \\"de-Iberianization\\", as Portugal consolidated its cultural and political independence from Spain. Portuguese nationalism, aroused by success on the battlefield, produced hostile reactions to Spain and to Spanish things and persons. By this time, Portuguese society was composed of two basic elements: those who participated in the gradual Europeanization process, the ‚Äúpolitical nation,‚Äù and those who remained largely unchanged, the majority of the people, who remained apolitical and passive.Republican Portugal: A Political History, 1910‚Äì1926 by Douglas L.

A social visit requires the ability to get into the house, to pass through interior doorways, and enter a bathroom to use the toilet. Visitability stresses specific accessibility features from a social reform perspective, and counters social isolation. Description Newly constructed homes often contain the same major barriers as older ones: steps at every entrance and narrow interior doors, with the bathroom door usually the narrowest one in the house. Supporters want to change construction practices so that virtually all new homes, whether or not designated for people with mobility impairments, offer three specific accessibility features that will make it possible for most people to visit: # at least one zero-step entrance on an accessible route leading from a driveway or public sidewalk, # all interior doors being wide enough to allow a wheelchair to pass through (approximately 81 cm or 32 in), and # at least a toilet (room) on the main floor. These features are designed around the needs of a person using a wheelchair while visiting, but they are also helpful to people with other kinds of mobility impairments. Temporary disabilities could create a need, for example a resident breaks a leg and requires a wheelchair, walker or other mobility device for an extended period. * Living permanently in the home with a significant mobility impairment requires two additional basic features on the main floor: a full bathroom and a bedroom (or a space that could be converted to a bedroom). * Visitability is similar to Universal Design in general intention, but is more focused in scope, more specific in parameters, and more explicitly grounded in a social reform intent. * Neither of these are a part of the visitability standards. Visitability features make homes easier for people who develop a mobility impairment to visit friends and extended family. The consequence of not having a visitable home is usually having to turn down invitations, or not be invited at all. These features also provide a basic shell of access to permit newly disabled people to remain in their homes, rather than forcing them to do expensive renovations, relocate to a different house, live in an inaccessible home which endangers their health and safety, or move into a nursing home. Specific goals # A focus on single-family homes instead of public buildings. Access to new public buildings, such as government offices and restaurants, is typically already required under various national laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in the United States. Outside of the UK, single-family homes are the one kind of building which is still routinely constructed without regard to access. # Every home instead of just \\"special\\" homes. Being able to attend the party is better than isolation, or the risk of being \\"helped up the steps.\\" People who use wheelchairs or walkers, or are impaired by stiffness, weakness or balance problems are blocked by steps at every entrance of a home. Wheelchair users are stopped by inches from fitting through the bathroom door in a friend or relative's home. # Narrowing the emphasis to the most essential features, which are: #* entering a home, #* fitting through the interior doors, and #* being able to use a toilet. :While there are many possible or desirable features, strongly prioritizing the few features which are most crucial to visiting or residing in a home greatly increases the likelihood of widespread construction change. Basic access goes beyond visiting. It also helps a person of any age who develops a temporary or permanent mobility impairment. Without basic access in place, architecture forces severe choices: * Expensive renovations, assuming that the necessary changes are possible. * Being unable to enter or exit the home independently, or to use the bathroom at all. * Moving to another home or to a nursing home or other specialized facility. These issues can apply equally to a person who is recovering from surgery, or to a person who has used a wheelchair for decades. New construction issues Zero-step entrances on new homes are nearly always easy to construct, whether the terrain is flat or hilly. The entrance can be constructed at the front, side or back. Wherever is most feasible for the topography. A driveway or sidewalk can be a tool for access to the best entrance. Porches and decks can be used to incorporate access, often in a manner where it is not as obvious as many ramps. The key to accessibility is including access in the planning stage. On new construction, a zero-step entrance can usually be incorporated without an obvious \\"ramp\\" per se, i.e. without a structure that has 90-degree dropoffs at the edges and rails at the sides. In most cases, grading and landscaping can make a ramp unnecessary. Deliberately grading to permit the sidewalk to meet the porch without a step creates access with an invisible modification. For the 40% of homes built with a slab-on-grade foundation, the zero-step entrance is typically extremely easy. The methods for homes are virtually identical to those used for slab-built commercial buildings such as banks and restaurants. For homes with basements or crawlspaces, several solutions can provide low- cost, attractive zero-step entrances. Among these are using a porch as a bridge to the sidewalk; lowering the first-floor rim joist into a notch in the foundation wall at the time of construction; a short, conventional ramp tied into a side or back deck or porch; creative use of a small retaining wall; and constructing the zero-step entrance from the garage. Siting the home properly on the lot is the first step. Then grading and landscaping with access in mind makes creating a zero-step entrance quite easy. History In the United States, the Visitability movement was begun by grass roots advocates led by Eleanor Smith in an organization called Concrete Change. She originated and developed the concept in 1986, at that time using the term \\"Basic Home Access\\". In 1990, when US advocates learned that the term \\"Visitability\\" was used in the United Kingdom (UK) for a similar concept, they adopted the term to emphasize that the goal is not the traditional \\"more homes for the disabled\\" but rather a change in standard homebuilding procedure. The Atlanta chapter of Habitat for Humanity became the first organization to commit to going beyond accessibility in homes with disabled family members. By including these basic access features in every home built their commitment contributes to an inclusive neighborhood for people with disabilities. Concrete Change continues to grow in number of participants and number of open-market houses built with the basic features. In 2017 Eleanor Smith retired Concrete Change. NCIL, the National Council on Independent Living has agreed to transition and maintain all her data from the Concrete Change website to a new website; www.visitability.org. The UK has applied the most widespread legal application of the concept to date. In 1999, Parliament passed \\"section M\\", an amendment to residential building regulations requiring basic access in all new homes.\\"Doors to Be Swept Away in New Rules for Builders,\\" Rachel Kelley, The Times, December 5, 1997. Advocates maintain that the philosophical underpinning of Visitability is as important as the list of features. They maintain that building homes with steps at all entrances and narrow interior doors is an unacceptable violation of human rights, given the harsh effects the barriers have on so many people's lives: physically unsafe living conditions, social isolation and forced institutionalization. Benefits * Residents in the community can welcome guests who use wheelchairs, crutches, canes, walkers (walking frames), or have some other mobility impairment such as stiffness, weakness or poor balance. When visitability is in place, mobility-limited people are not socially isolated by architecture. * A family member can develop a disability through illness, accident or aging. The person and their family are more likely to be able to remain in their existing home. The alternatives can be drastic: ** Major, expensive renovation; ** Sell your home to purchase another house, which still may need modifications for accessibility; ** Build a new home or ** Move out that family member to a nursing home. * All residents find it easier to bring in baby strollers, grocery carts, or heavy furniture. * Visitable homes enhance sale and resale in an era where both the number and the percent of older people are growing rapidly. Non-disabled buyers are attracted to well-designed homes that welcome their aging relatives and friends and provide easy-use convenience for themselves. * Temporary disabilities, i.e. broken leg, surgery, etc., can require the use of a wheelchair or other mobility device during the recovery/rehabilitation period. This can be a major problem in most existing homes lacking these basic accessibility features. In some cases forcing a person out of their home during the recovery period. * Visitability features cost little up front - unlike the much higher after-the-fact cost of widening doors, adding ramps or electric porch lifts and other remodeling. * Besides human rights, advocates cite the economic implications of visitability. By 2010, research by the National Association of Home Builders indicates that half of all US homes will be headed by persons 55 years old or older.\\"Profile of the 50+ Housing Market,\\" Nations Building News, July 31, 2006. Average nursing home costs exceed $60,000 dollars per year per resident, while nearly 70% of nursing home costs are paid with public funds.\\"Medicaid and Long-term Care,\\" Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, May 2004. Staying out of institutions as long as possible is a strong desire of most people and also financially beneficial to individuals, families, and society.  Disadvantages  * The adoption of visitability over the broad spectrum of newly constructed dwellings could lead to a built environment deemed sterile and disengaged from regional and traditional practices. ** This can be easily overcome by incorporating visibility features into traditional designs and not trying to make it a cookie cutter design. Adoption of visitability laws It is difficult to definitively track the adoption of visitability across the world. A combination of legal mandates, incentive programs, and voluntary programs exist. The term \\"visitability\\" is not used in all efforts. Other factors complicating the research include the lack of an organization assigned to monitor visitability ordinances, and ordinances and laws that often do not specify the agency responsible for implementation. The AARP Public Policy Institute has produced a report ‚Äì Increasing Home Access: Designing for Visitability.Increasing Home Access: Designing for Visitability Page 32 has a summary of US efforts. In the United States, successful Visitability legislation has been passed in many localities, including Atlanta, Georgia; Pima County, Arizona; Bolingbrook, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; and the State of California.Concrete Change, op.cit. As of June 2006, 46 state and local municipalities had a confirmed visitability program in place; while 25 of these programs are mandatory ordinances, the other 21 are voluntary initiatives (i.e. cash and tax incentives for builders and consumers, consumer awareness campaigns, and certification programs). In addition, there are numerous efforts to establish visitability programs in other states, counties and cities across the country. The research identified another 30 initiatives currently underway. They range from organized groups of individuals with an expressed interest in beginning a visitability program to locations that are in the final stages of developing a program.Maisel, J. (2006).

A case will often include either the resolution or a rephrasing of it. The case is the advocacy established by the Pro in the First affirmative constructive speech, often constructed around the support of a policy recommendation known as the affirmative plan. While the 1AC defines the parameters for the bulk of an affirmative's argument, the term \\"case\\" can be used to cover the entirety of the affirmative argument more broadly, referring, for instance, to additional advantages, counter-arguments, or rebuttal evidence that might be introduced in later speeches (if at all). The Structure of the Case The case is a form of on-topic debate and can also be referred to as C if done in the standard way C is a very effective way to win a case. The case is generally organized into sections called \\"observations\\" or \\"contentions\\", with advantages attached to the link or link break. Observation or Contention A typical case includes between two and four observations/contentions, depending on the speed of the intended speaker and the length of the observations/contentions. Traditionally, observations/contentions address one of the stock issues and are labeled accordingly. For example: *Contention 1: Significant Harms *Contention 2: Inherency *Plan *Contention 3: Solvency Or: *Observation 1: Inherency *Plan *Advantage 1 *Advantage 2 *Advantage 3 *Observation 2: Solvency These outlines are quite general, and different debaters may retain some or none of the above structural elements as their situations dictate. On an aesthetic level, for example, it is not uncommon for some cases to include creative titles for observations and advantages. A case increasing the number of pilots in the United States Air Force might call the first contention \\"Air Power.\\" On a more practical level, recent policy debate cases have made a habit of including one or more contentions that do not directly relate to the affirmative thesis but are designed to preempt common negative attacks. For instance, a team running a case often considered nontopical might devote 45 seconds of the first affirmative constructive to reading contextual definitions of disputed terms in order to frame the debate in a favorable light early on. (Because topicality is a \\"meta-issue\\" it is traditionally omitted from the opening presentation of the case, although historically an introductory contention where the affirmative defined the terms of the resolution was much more common.) Additionally, teams might decide to include \\"non-unique\\" contentions, where the information presented bears little on the overall affirmative argument other than to say that any negative disadvantage should have already occurred in the status quo. Advantages While some high school regions prefer affirmative cases to be organized around the \\"stock issues,\\" others have stressed an emphasis on a \\"comparative advantage\\" style case construction. The primary difference between the two forms of cases is one of style and emphasis, though in many instances the information presented can be almost identical. A case built around \\"advantages\\" stresses the superiority of the plan (or broader affirmative advocacy) to the status quo, through a series of direct comparisons between the plan and the status quo. The impact calculus offered within advantages can vary widely across different cases. Some might argue that the plan affects a \\"policy\\" change for the better, or prevents something that is bad that the status quo all but guarantees. For instance, an advantage to a plan increasing the strength of United Nations peacekeeping operations in Kashmir could argue that such an operation would prevent nuclear war between India and Pakistan. An advantage might also be more philosophical in nature. Loosely defined as \\"critical\\" or \\"critical\\" such advantages tend to eschew traditional cost-benefit analysis, claiming either that there are philosophical problems with the status quo such as prevalent racism, heteronormativity/homophobia, patriarchy, militarism, which the plan can address, or that certain forms of analysis (for instance, Consequentialism) are on face immoral and should be rejected as possible tools to evaluate the affirmative case. Some more \\"critical\\" cases might also argue that the advocacy of the affirmative should not be reduced to a \\"plan\\" or policy advocacy, opting instead to defend it as a \\"speech act\\" or \\"discourse\\" more holistically or, even more, advantageous in policy debate, the moral thematic composition. An example of the last type of \\"case\\" is the Socratic Flow that poses and answers known Inherency problems at the level of debate theory by winning only on Justification, and all else follows. When presented by the Negative, the Negative uses hardly any evidence cards of their own and rely on their own comprehension and wit, proceeding to challenge and improve upon, rather than outright refute the Affirmative plan or diminish Affirmative advocacy, arguing that the resolution or resolution topic should be morally reasoned without incurring negativity. One type of Negative team's Socratic Flow is a cooperative tag team entreaty to win the whole thing, the win-win- win that includes the judge. Case without Plan In \\"pure\\" policy debate, which occurs infrequently in intercollegiate policy debate tournaments but quite often in professorial or academic debate occasions, the Affirmative does not have to run a plan but presents the resolution as sufficient for affirming, which is the argument of \\"resolution is policy\\", and that is what is to be debated rather than any particular plan that can be constructed. Partial plans are presented as examples of the policy rather than policy implementation that have to meet stock issue burdens. The difference between this type of policy debate, \\"pure\\" debate similar to Congressional policymaking, is that speech-acts and discourse and discursiveness and critics are all rejected, and it is mostly experiential rather than experimental or exhausting. This school of thought, focused on at that level of debate by debate coaches and educators and resolution drafters, has had some presence at ADA and NDT and practically none at CEDA, culminating in a) Monolithic Justification for the resolution and indemnifying some misunderstandings in Solvency and Topicality, the consolidated and quirkily named b) Kritik Blas√© compendium of arguments, has expanded policy debate to include c) differentiation with nonpolicy important governance topics, has allowed for d) virtue debate for oratory and e) weighs resources more judiciously rather than expecting a select group of agencies to merely go ahead with a plan, answering the moral obligation question. Pure policy debate harkens way back to minstrel songs and soliloquies found, for example, in the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, the saga of the trial and redemption of Socrates in virtue ethics, and incorporates ADA's emphasis on statis theory from classical rhetoric to overcome stagnancy in the status quo. In the case of c) above, it is argued that policy is different from many other instruments of government: protocol, treaties, the economy itself, \\"law enforcement\\", punditry and politicking, a certain class of \\"U.S. interests\\", societal norms, and so on. And in the case of d) above, the recent favoring of blurby speaking among student debaters is disfavored in pure policy debate. Instead, policy debaters favor oratory and syllogistic argumentation that still emphasizes the power of persuasiveness. The idea of \\"attack\\" and \\"offense\\" are rearranged to mitigate offensiveness towards one's interlocutor. Policy debate, different from debating policy plans, is a \\"pure\\" values debate about which resolutions are best or better than the given resolution's stated policy goals. The bright-line debate between some of the adversarial groups' modern classical issues is narrow and difficult to debate for the uninitiated debate club. For example, some perennial arguments are act-agency, power-versus-trust, authority-versus- viability, feasibility-versus-completeness. Some debates have ended and have been removed as unfavored arguments: arguments about regime legitimacy, arguments from positive legalism, constructivism, distinctions between legal implementation and lawful enforcement, savagery-versus-brutalism, the constitutionality of administrative law, and many more. Not a lot of counter- resolutions are run, but they are considered within topicality debate and the usual stock issues. One new stock issue has been added for all topics: biomass disparity implicit burden. The \\"I would drop to the floor\\", \\"I would be dropping off the furniture\\" argument is valid, the argument about brutalism. For example, the given resolution states that the Federal government should substantially reduce the number of criminal statutes. A debater on the Negative could call for an outright overhaul of codified law that eschews the idea of and malediction about \\"criminal\\" statutes.

The school is operated by the Indian River County School District. The campus of VBHS encompasses approximately , which includes the Freshman Learning Center and main campus areas. The combination of school enrollment and the size of the physical plant make VBHS the largest high school in Indian River County. The Freshman Learning Center serves about 750 9th grade students. Vero Beach High School has completed a three-year, $51 million remodeling project.  History  Vero Beach High School can trace its timeline back to the class of 1905, and a one- room schoolhouse where children of all ages were taught. In 1925, the first official Vero Beach High School opened. It was located about a half-mile north of the current location, where Vero Beach High School's Freshman Learning Center stands today. After Vero Beach High School moved to its present-day location in 1963, the old high school became Vero Beach Junior High School, and VBHS took on a new official name, Vero Beach Senior High School. In 1977, the junior high school was becoming insufficient for housing all of the county's junior high schoolers, and was torn down to make way for a new, smaller school, Indian River Middle 8 - the present-day home of the Freshman Learning Center, and soon to become a middle school again, once all the renovations at Vero Beach High School are complete. Prior to the completion of Sebastian River High School in 1994, Vero Beach High School was the only public high school in Indian River County. Former principal Jane Hudson retired at the end of the 2008-2009 school year. A year later, Vero Beach High School had a new principal, Eric Seymour. Seymour was a graduate of Vero Beach High School himself, and earned a master's degree at Nova Southeastern University. Afterward, Seymour became an administrator at Vero Beach High School, but left to become an assistant principal at Lincoln Park Academy in Fort Pierce, Florida. Seymour was principal from the 2009-2010 school year to 2011-2012 school year. Shawn O'Keefe took over for the 2012-2013 school year. On January 1st, 2019, the Vero Beach High School Fighting Indians Band performed in the 2019 London New Year's Day Parade in London.

One hundred and thirteen of the island's one hundred and twenty-five acres are managed by the park system. It is a complex of mounds and accumulated shell, fish bone, and pottery middens that rises more than 30 feet above the waters of the bay. Mound Key was an important site of the Calusa tribe, and most experts believe it to be the site of their capital, Calos. The Mound Key Site on the island was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970. The island is only accessible by boat from the Koreshan State Historic Site or Lovers Key State Park. History Mound Key was created over 2,000 years ago by the Calusa. The Calusa culture is carbon-dated back to 1150 B.C. at Mound Key. The site likely began as a low-lying oyster bar on Estero Bay. The site would have been rich in marine food resources, and very appealing to the Calusa, who were actually hunter-gatherers. As the human population grew, food waste was heaped into the middens that form the island. The Calusa formed an extensive structure of mounds, water courts and canals whose features still exist today. Mounds were constructed by the collection and organization of \\"midden\\" which is a collaboration of shells, fish and animal bone, and artifacts such as pottery. Islands that were created by the Calusa, such as Mound Key are sometimes called \\"trash-heaps\\" as their composition is made from waste products of their culture. They are not however, just \\"heaps of Calusa garbage\\" simply tossed aside, but intricate compositions of substrate that were used for a display of power, religious monuments, and as burial memorials. It served for many years as the ceremonial center for their kingdom, which extended over numerous shell midden islands they made up and down the southwest coast of Florida. It is also believed by most researchers to have been the site of Calos, the capital of their kingdom. Their kingdom spanned from Tampa Bay southward to the Ten Thousand Islands and eastward to Lake Okeechobee. The arrival of the Spanish was the beginning of the end for the Calusa. In 1566, the appointment of Spain's first Governor of Florida happened on the island. This was closely followed by the establishment there of a fort and settlement, in an effort to colonize the area. A Jesuit mission was also founded there at the same time by Juan Rogel, a priest of that order. Called San Ant√≥n de Carlos, it was the first such mission in the Spanish New World. There was frequent conflict with the Calusa, though, and eventually the island was abandoned by the Spanish in 1569. The Spanish brought with them diseases to which the Calusa had no immunity. These diseases and warfare with the Spanish eventually ended the Calusa civilization around 1750. In subsequent years, the island was used and sometimes inhabited by pirates, fishermen (Cuban, Portuguese and Spanish), and American pioneers, among others. Frank Johnson and his wife, Grandma Johnson, were given a homestead on Mound Key in 1891. This marked a period of European immigration to the former Calusa capital. Grandma Johnson remained at Mound Key and allowed several families ‚Äî Luettich, Hawkins, Hanson and Fernandez ‚Äî to build homes on the island. She taught them to fish, to farm, how to build houses that would stay cool in the summer and protect them against Florida's abusive sun and summer storms. By the turn of the 20th century, most all Mound Key settlers had moved up river to Estero, then a citrus and cow farming town. The Johnsons sold the island to the Koreshans, a utopian cult, in 1905. In 1894, the followers of a scientific/religious belief system known as Koreshanity arrived in the area. They built a community based on their utopian ideas, growing over the next two decades. During this time, part of the property they acquired included most of the parcels on Mound Key. After the death of their leader, Cyrus Teed, in 1908, their numbers declined. In 1961, the remaining Koreshans decided to give over ownership of the key, as well as other land in nearby Estero, to the state. It was used to form the park, which is administered by the Koreshan State Historic Site. Approximately nine acres still remain privately owned by the McGee family. The McGee family agreed to sell their remaining parcel to Lee County in 2019. In 2020, archeologists confirmed that Mound Key was the site of Fort San Ant√≥n de Carlos. Which was a Spanish fort as well as one of the first Jesuit sites in North America. The fort was abandoned in 1569, after the Spanish-Calusa alliance broke apart. The fort is also the oldest known North American example of Tabby concrete. Recreational Activities The park has such amenities as boating, fishing, wildlife viewing and interpretive exhibits. Nature trails and information kiosks are being developed but no restroom facilities are available at the park. The only access to the island is by boat; there are no facilities. Interpretive displays can be found along a trail that spans the width of the island. Located in Estero Bay, the park is a few miles by boat from both the Koreshan State Historic Site and Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park.

First published in 1996, it is the thirteenth book in Cussler's Dirk Pitt series. The events in the book take place between January and March 2000. Plot summary While investigating the deaths of a large number of marine animals, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino encounter a group of tourists on Seymour Island. Aboard the tourists' cruise ship (the Polar Queen), a mysterious \\"disease\\" has killed everyone on board. The tourists are brought to the Ice Hunter, a research vessel for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). Here, they find out that the Polar Queen is missing and will not respond to their calls. After some searching, Pitt and Al discover that the missing ship is heading towards a cliff. After being winched onto the ship from a helicopter, Pitt steers and manages to narrowly avoid the crash. But he finds only one surviving passenger on board: Deirdre. Maeve, the tour guide from Seymour Island, is Deirdre's sister, and she seems perplexed to find Deirdre aboard. Pitt and Al uncover more evidence to suggest that the passengers of the Polar Queen were killed by extremely high-powered soundwaves. At this time, more outbreaks occur on a cargo ship and a Chinese junk. The cargo ship blows up while a boarding party from a passing ship is aboard; in the distance, a futuristic yacht is spotted heading away from the scene. We learn that the yacht belongs to the Dorsett Consolidated Mining Company, a gemstone mining company headed by the ruthless Arthur Dorsett. Dorsett is also the father of Maeve, Deirdre and a third daughter, Boudicca. Of Dorsett's three daughters, Maeve is the only one who does not work for his company. As a young girl, she ran away from home, broke all bonds with her family, and changed her last name to Fletcher. By borrowing the US Navy sonar net in the Pacific, NUMA discovers that the acoustic plague appears to be caused by a convergence of soundwaves from four sources around the Pacific: in the southwest, Gladiator Island; in the northwest, one of the Commander Islands; in the northeast, Kunghit Island; and in the southeast, Easter Island. Since Kunghit Island is located not far from the United States, Pitt decides to go there to investigate. He enlists the help of Mason Broadmoor, a Native American fisherman who, along with his associates, delivers fish to the Kunghit Island mine every week. During one such visit, Pitt is smuggled onto the island and given a tour of the mine by a disgruntled employee, who, Pitt finds out, is Clive Cussler. The mine has a revolutionary mining method in which high-powered soundwaves are used to dig through clay containing diamonds. Pitt learns that the Dorsetts have kidnapped both of Maeve's sons and are holding them hostage. The company security force captures Pitt as he leaves the island, but Broadmoor rescues him, and the two escape using jet skis. Soon after returning to the US, Pitt, Al and Maeve are sent to Wellington to board another research vessel, the Ocean Angler. Their mission is to covertly infiltrate Gladiator Island, find Maeve's sons, and bring everybody back to the vessel. However, the plan is derailed when the pickup car drives them to a Dorsett company warehouse instead of to the research vessel. After a failed escape attempt, they are all brought onto the Dorsett yacht and immediately put out to sea. After about a day, Pitt, Al and Maeve are abandoned in the southwest Pacific Ocean, in a small craft and far away from ordinary shipping routes; in addition, a tropical cyclone is quickly approaching. Meanwhile, the NUMA computer center in Washington discovers a way to predict the coming convergence zones, and in a few weeks the Hawaiian island of Oahu will be hit. The head of NUMA, Admiral James Sandecker, fails to convince the President of the looming threat, so he launches a clandestine operation to avert the disaster. The plan is to reflect the soundwaves from the convergence zone back towards Gladiator Island. A giant reflector is obtained from a government agency; it is dismantled, loaded onto the famous deep-sea recovery ship Glomar Explorer, and brought into the convergence zone. Pitt, Al, and Maeve have successfully endured the storm and finally stumbled upon a small island. Here they find the remains of a sailboat, which they use along with their own battered craft to build a small sailship. With this ship, they set course for Gladiator Island, planning to rescue Maeve's sons from her evil family. As they climb ashore, the sound reflector outside Oahu successfully reflects the high-powered soundwave toward Gladiator Island. At the same time, scientists realize that this could cause both volcanoes on the island to erupt. Admiral Sandecker is shocked when he receives a call from Pitt, using Mr. Dorsett's phone. Pitt and Al rescue Maeve's sons and kill Arthur, Boudicca and Deirdre Dorsett; however, Deirdre fatally shoots Maeve before Pitt kills her. Pitt and Al flee, using the Dorsett yacht to make their escape. Al takes the children aboard a helicopter that was parked on the yacht, and as they fly away from the island, Al sees the yacht engulfed by a pyroclastic ash cloud with Pitt still on board. Al arrives to a safe landing point, where he is recruited by rescue officials to fly back to the island. Al is concerned about what he will find there, but he has already decided to fly back and try to rescue his friend Pitt. Al also agrees to take a load of food, fresh water, and medical supplies to the islanders, who will most certainly need the items in the days following the eruptions. Upon his arrival at the island, Al is told that the authorities have received no radio communication to suggest that Pitt is still alive. As Al begins to mourn the loss of his best friend, he hears new information about a stranded yacht that has been seen floating several miles from the island. Al, feeling it might be Pitt, flies the helicopter to the coordinates hoping to find Pitt alive. Al indeed finds that Pitt is alive, having survived by barricading himself from the searing heat of the ash cloud. Sadly, however, Maeve is discovered dead from the injuries she sustained at the hand of her sister. We also discover that, prior to her untimely death, she and Pitt had pledged their deepest love for each other. After Pitt is rescued, he flies back to D.C. on a commercial jet flight and heads home, but not before spending some time in a hospital recovering from his very serious injuries. 1996 American novels Dirk Pitt novels Novels set in Antarctica Fiction set in 2000 Books with cover art by Paul Bacon ","title":"Shock Wave (novel)"},{"id":"6357802","text":"MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park was a theme park adjacent to the MGM Grand hotel and casino in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It operated from 1993 to 2002. The original plan for the theme park was to make it family-oriented by providing activities for children. The overall Wizard of Oz theming of the hotel and casino provided the motto to literally \\"follow the yellow brick road\\" from inside the hotel to the entrance to the theme park, which was built on the hotel's backlot. Opened on December 18, 1993, along with the rest of the complex, the then 33-acre (13.4 ha) MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park looked like a small-version of larger counterparts Disney's Hollywood Studios and Universal Studios, which utilized a movie studio-backlot theme. During a later expansion of the hotel's pool and convention facilities, the area of the park was reduced by 40% to an area of . For 2001, the theme park was renamed The Park at MGM Grand and served as a rental facility for corporate functions, before being closed permanently in 2002. Since 2006, the property has been occupied by The Signature at MGM Grand. History MGM Grand Adventures opened on 33 acres of land on December 18, 1993. From 1994 to 1997, the park was renamed Scream Park each October for Halloween. This separate admission event included several haunted houses in and around the park's attractions. In May 1996, the MGM Grand planned an $8 million reconfiguration of the park, which had performed below expectations. The plan included relocating and lengthening its roller coaster. In June and July 1996, MGM Grand Adventures offered \\"Bustin' Loose\\" summer block parties, in which the park was converted into three separately themed areas with live entertainment and interactive games. In May 1997, a pool, spa, and a 380,000 square-foot conference center were being built on 15 acres of land previously occupied by a portion of MGM Grand Adventures, reducing the park to 18.8 acres. Additions and improvements were being made to the theme park in June 1997. In 1998, MGM Grand Adventures switched to a seasonal operation, with the park usually re-opening in April and continuing operations through the summer. In July 2000, MGM Mirage reviewed the park's land for possible alternative uses, despite being pleased with its performance. The park closed on September 4, 2000.MGM Grand Adventures  Las Vegas, NV At the end of the month, MGM Mirage began putting all of the park's rides and attractions up for sale through a California amusement park equipment broker, while cautioning that the park could re-open in spring 2001 if the equipment could not be sold for an adequate price. In February 2001, MGM Mirage announced plans to rename MGM Grand Adventures as The Park at MGM. The park would only be open for group business and special events with 50 or more people, with general admission tickets no longer being issued. The park retained three rides, a 900-seat amphitheater, and two 750-seat theaters. Keeping the park open for special events was used to generate income while still considering other options for the land, including the development of timeshares, luxury condominiums, entertainment complexes or additional casino and hotel space. The park permanently closed in 2002, after a Jimmy Buffett \\"Parrothead\\" private party on Memorial Day. According to the Las Vegas Sun, the park \\"flopped because it lacked any exciting rides,\\" and suffered from low attendance because of expensive ticket prices. The Las Vegas Review-Journal opined that the park \\"failed to take into consideration that a third of its visitors come from California where theme parks are ubiquitous and always racing to unveil the latest in thrill rides.\\" On December 5, 2002, MGM Mirage announced plans to build a luxury condominium and hotel complex on the site of the closed theme park. MGM Grand Adventures was replaced by The Signature at MGM Grand. Changes Over the years, the park saw several changes. It opened with expensive ticket prices, by 1993 standards, with an admission charge of $25 for adults that were not guests of the hotel. Over time this fee was reduced in order to better match the caliber of attractions in the park and to increase attendance. By 1995, entry was $15 and $18 for the Halloween Scream Park. Promotions such as summer nighttime concerts and spring break events were done to draw more crowds with additional attractions such as bungee runs and bounce houses added for those events. In a move to put some thrills in the park, in 1996, the park added Sky Screamer, a . Riders were strapped into harnesses and lifted up a \\"launch tower\\" where they then pulled a ripcord setting into motion a 100-foot free fall upwards of 70 mph (110 km/h). It was placed over a lagoon that had once been home to a large faux steamboat (a snack bar was its only resident). As of 2000, it was billed as the world's largest sky coaster. The result was a very tall structure that could be seen from anywhere in the park. At night, it was lighted in the same green color as the hotel tower providing an impressive visual. Over time the line-up of attractions changed, especially with the expansion of the hotel's pool and convention facilities. These changes also meant the entrance to the park was drastically changed and now involved a lengthy walk from the hotel, making the park seem like a separate entity. The 40% reduction in area of the park entailed the removal of the Backlot River Tour, Deep Earth Exploration, and Manhattan Theatre. Although unaffected by the layout change, The Haunted Mine was also closed. The Lightning Bolt was initially an indoor roller coaster. In 1997, it had been relocated outdoors to the northern end of the park, to a former special event space in the northwest corner. The ride was later expanded by Arrow Dynamics to include a second , and an extended run over the Grand Canyon Rapids. For a short time, other smaller temporary flat- rides called the park home including a Chance Rides Zipper, Ferris Wheel, and Chaos. None of these attractions stayed very long but did help increase the attractions count. Another addition to the park came in the form of \\"Kiddie Island.\\" This was an island created in the lagoon near the base of Sky Screamer. It was home to a variety of small attractions such as a paddle boat river, Red Baron airplane ride, and Carousel. Original attractions MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park was built around a movie studio theme and provided for somewhat of a Disney-type experience. It had several themed areas, including Casablanca Plaza, New York Street, Asian Village, French Street, Salem Waterfront, Tumbleweed Gulch, Rio Grande Cantina, New Orleans Street, and Olde England Street. The park's characters were mostly cartoon characters such as Betty Boop and King Looey. There were ten major rides and attractions, eleven restaurants and fast food areas, and a dozen retail shops. The original attractions line-up included: * Backlot River Tour - A mix between Disney's Jungle Cruise and Universal Studios Hollywood's Studio Tour, in which passengers embarked on a tour via a large boat that passed mock-ups of movie sets with special effects such as gun fire, rain, and water cannons. The queue was the longest in the park and featured additional information on special effects. * Deep Earth Exploration - This ride opened shortly after the park due to technology challenges. It was the first attraction of its kind to incorporate a traditional 3-D movie dark ride with a motion simulator. Passengers boarded faux deep earth tunneling machines on a journey to the center of the earth, guided by an animatronic Robot Pilot (voiced by actor Matt Cates). The ride involved a number of stops where windows on the vehicle would open allowing the occupants to look out at special effects along the route. * Lightning Bolt - An indoor, space-themed roller coaster with a top speed of 35 mph. In 1997, the roller coaster was moved outdoors, and was made to be twice as long. * The Haunted Mine - A traditional dark ride where passengers boarded ore cars on a trip into an abandoned mining operation. * Grand Canyon Rapids - A white water rapids raft ride with special effects such as an old west gun fight and a tunnel explosion. * Over the Edge - A log flume ride through an old sawmill, with two drops of and and a top speed of 25 MPH. * Parisian Taxis - bumper cars on the streets of Paris. * Pirates' Cove - A 950-seat outdoor theater complete with a pirate ship and lagoon that were home to the \\"Dueling Pirates Stunt Spectacular\\". * Magic Screen Theatre - Indoor theater that hosted a variety of shows including BMX Grind, a stunt show featuring BMX and in-Line skating. It opened with 2 shows; blacklight puppet show called Kaleidoscope and a live recreation of The Three Stooges. * King Looey Theatre (later Manhattan Theatre) - Indoor theater that hosted a variety of shows, including an ice skating spectacle starring King Looey. * You're in the Movies (later Gold Rush Theatre) - Indoor theater that hosted a variety of shows. Characters * King Looey was the child friendly version of the Leo the Lion mascot. King Looey wore a black tuxedo with a red bow and a golden crown.

Chris Carothers and Dan Burton of Early Day Miners make up their core, with a revolving door of drummers.  Biography  Formed in Bloomington, Indiana in the winter of 1994 after Chris Carothers (guitar) and Rory Leitch (drums) met at Indiana University. Guitarist Dan Burton joined the group the following spring, cementing the band's loud, instrumental rock sound. Steve Albini and Carl Saff recorded the band's debut EP, Pills vs. Planes, which was released in December 1996. The spring of 1997 saw the release of the Modern Gang Reader/Larkin single, the first of several releases for Secretly Canadian Records. The band worked with Andy Bryant at King Size on German Water, its debut album for Secretly Canadian, releasing it in March 1998. A return to Albini's Chicago studio, Electrical Audio, yielded the four-song EP Summing The Approach, which was released in the fall of 1998. Taking a break while Carothers moved out west and Burton worked on Early Day Miners, Ativin reconvened in 2001 with drummer Kevin Duneman, to record Interiors, which added sparse, minimalist vocals to their sound. Interiors was released in early 2002 to critical acclaim.

They play in the highest-level national league, the Czech Extraliga. The club A player in HC Karlovy Vary jersey The history of the ice hockey in Karlovy Vary dates back to the 1932,http://www.hokejkv.cz/zobraz.asp?t=historie when a few enthusiasts established SK Slavia Karlovy Vary. The home arena of this club was a small lake nicknamed Little Versailles. In 1948, an artificial ice rink was built, which significantly improved the standards. Within a few years, the ice hockey team Karlovy Vary was competing on a national level. The club steadily remained in the first league (P≈ôebor republiky) in the years 1951‚Äì52, 1952‚Äì53, 1953‚Äì54, 1954‚Äì55. The numbers of spectators coming to the games in those days were up to and over 10 000. In 1953 the team's name changed to 'Dynamo'. One of the greatest achievements of those days can be considered the games with HK Lokomotiv Moscow which ended 2:3 for Dynamo, or victory 8:5 against the Czechoslovakian National Team (which was training for the World Championships). Many key players were injured during the season 1954-55 and the club got relegated to the second league. However, as dominant as Dynamo was in the second league, they never managed to get back to the top league. The team was renamed back to Slavia in 1965. As harsh times came at the end of the 70s when the arena started to fall into disrepair and was not fit for purpose any more, the council decided to build two ice rinks. The construction of the first, training rink commenced shortly and was completed in 1975. The project to build the arena of national standards next to the training ground was never realized. The existing ice rink had the roof put on by the end of 80s. In 1990, changing rooms were built and further improvements were carried out such as new services, cooling of the surface, barriers with artificial glass, etc.http://www.zimnistadiony.cz/view.php?cisloclanku=2003010103 Basically everything that was missing right from the start. A large financial burden and no interest of the local council caused that the club was relegated to the division group (note: 1) Extraliga ('Extra League'), 2) 1. liga ('First League'), 3) 2.liga ('Second League'), 4) krajsk√© p≈ôebory ('Division').http://www.cslh.cz/souteze/2-1liga.html All changed in 1991 with a new management and generous sponsor: firm Jan Becher.http://hokej.idnes.cz/sponzor-karlovarskeho-hokeje-ohlasil- odchod-f39-/hokej.aspx?c=A010516_154733_hokej_rou From the season 1993/1994, the team's name was changed to HC Slavia Becherovka Karlovy Vary (from season 1996/1997 HC Becherovka Karlovy Vary). The club reached the First League in 1995 and a couple of years later in 1997, HC Becherovka Karlovy Vary fought their way into the Extra League. They did not managed to defeat Opava in the playoffs, but with a stable position in the competition, the club bought the rights of HC Olomouc which was in financial difficulties. The club got a new sponsor in 2002, the Sokolovskou uhelnou a. s., and was renamed to HC Energie. In season 2007/2008, the team, led by coach Zde≈àek Venera, fought their way into the finals, but lost in a 7-games battle to Prague's team Slavia. The club's effort paid off next year under the coach Josef Paleƒçek and captain V√°clav Skuhravy in repetition of last year's finals, HC Energie won 4:2 on games and celebrated their first Extraliga title.

The club Orli Znojmo is based in Znojmo and their home arena is Nevoga Arena. From 1999 to 2009, the club competed in the Czech Extraliga. Their biggest success in that league was a third-place finish in 2005-06. National Hockey League players Patrik Eli√°≈°, Martin Havl√°t and Tom√°≈° Vokoun played for this club during the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout. On 1 April 2009, Orli sold its Czech Extraliga license to another South Moravian club, HC Kometa Brno. After two seasons under ownership of Rene Burger in the Czech First League, the club announced on 31 May 2011 that they were joining the Austrian-based Erste Bank Hockey League. History The club was founded in 1933 originally as TJ Sokol Znojmo and played until the early 1990s, at only a regional level. In 1993, Znojmo entered a sponsorship with Czech-Austrian company Excalibur under Jaroslav Vlasak. With this financial support club moved to become a professional outfit and in 1994 joined the Czech Second League. Renamed SK Agropodnik Znojmo, they competed for the following three seasons in the Second League. From 1996, the club served as an affiliate to Extraliga clubs, HC Pardubice and HC Dukla Jihlava, in order to further establish junior players experience. After a successful playoffs in 1997, Znojmo were promoted to the Czech First League. In their two seasons in the Czech First League, Znojmo now known as HC Excalibur Znojem≈°t√≠ Orli, in reflecting their sponsorship, formed a competitive team and won their first Championship title in 1997‚Äì98 before failing to gain promotion in a 4:3 series defeat to HC Slezan Opava. After claiming their second consecutive title in the 1998‚Äì99 season, Znojmo were victorious in the promotion playoffs against Dukla Jihlava to celebrate their first entry into the Czech Extraliga. In the following years, the club was able to hold its own in the Extraliga, but never managed to get past the playoff semi-finals. In 2001 was called again changed their name due to sponsorship to new sponsor in HC JME Znojem≈°t√≠ Orli. The club's largest success in the Extraliga came in the achievement of the play- off semi-final in the 2005‚Äì06 season. After two seasons in the First League under Rene Burger in the spring of 2011, the club applied for inclusion in the Austrian Erste Bank Eishockey Liga. Under the ambition to give the team a new perspective, without having to take the financial risk of promotion in the Extraliga. On 31 May 2011, the EBEL granted the application after the Czech Ice Hockey Association's consent on the condition that the club continues to participate with a team in the first league. This requirement was not later maintained.

The IOC banned Perner for life from competing in the Olympics as the result of a doping scandal at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Biography He was a part of the Austrian national biathlon team since 1992. He failed to qualify for the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, but his career improved afterwards, firstly with a third place in Holmenkollen, and afterwards with his first World Cup in Novosibirsk. Perner competed in four Olympic Games, and won his only medal in the sprint at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he took bronze, behind Ole Einar Bj√∏rndalen and Sven Fischer.

Many of the pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica are known to have been literate societies, who produced a number of Mesoamerican writing systems of varying degrees of complexity and completeness. Mesoamerican writing systems arose independently from other writing systems in the world, and their development represents one of the very few such origins in the history of writing. The conquistadors brought their distinctive cultural creations, in the form of books, from Europe to the New World which further influenced native literature. The literature and texts created by indigenous Mesoamericans are the earliest-known from the Americas for primarily two reasons: Firstly the fact that the native populations of Mesoamerica were the first to enter into intensive contact with Europeans, assuring that many samples of Mesoamerican literature have been documented in surviving and intelligible forms. Secondly, the long tradition of Mesoamerican writing which undoubtedly contributed to the native Mesoamericans readily embracing the Latin alphabet of the Spaniards and creating many literary works written in it during the first centuries after the Spanish conquest of Mexico. This article summarizes current knowledge about indigenous Mesoamerican literatures in its broadest sense and describe it categorized by its literary contents and social functions. A reproduction of the original page 13 of the Codex Borbonicus, showing elements of an almanac associated with the 13th trecena of the tonalpohualli, the Aztec version of the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. Precolumbian literature When defining literature in its broadest possible sense, so to include all products of \\"literacy\\", its function in a literate community ought to be the focus of analysis. The following are known genres and functions of indigenous Mesoamerican literatures. Three major subjects of Mesoamerican literatures can be identified: *Religion, time and astronomy: Mesoamerican civilizations shared an interest in the recording and keeping track of time through observation of celestial bodies and religious rituals celebrating their different phases. Not surprisingly a large portion of the Mesoamerican literature that has been delivered down through time to us deals exactly with this kind of information. Particularly the true precolumbian literature such as the Mayan and Aztec codices deal with calendrical and astronomical information as well as describing the rituals connected to the passing of time. *History, power and legacy: Another large part of the Precolumbian literature is found carved into monumental structures such as stelae, altars and temples. This kind of literature typically documents power and heritage, memorize victories, ascension to rulership, dedications of monuments, marriages between royal lineages. * Mythical and fictive genres: Mostly present in postconquest versions but often relying on oral or pictorial traditions the mythical and narrative literature of Mesoamerica is very rich, and we can only guess as to how much has been lost. *Every day literature: Some texts are sort of every day literature such as descriptions of objects and their owners, graffiti inscriptions, but these only constitutes a very small part of the known literature. Pictorial vs. linguistic literature Geoffrey Sampson distinguishes between two kinds of writing. One kind of writing he calls 'semasiographical', this covers kinds of pictorial or ideographic writing that is not necessarily connected to phonetic language but can be read in different languages, this kind of writing is for example used in roadsigns which can be read in any language. The other kind of writing is phonetic writing called by Sampson 'glottographic' writing and which represents the sounds and words of languages and allows accurate linguistic readings of a text that is the same at every reading. In Mesoamerica the two types were not distinguished, and so writing, drawing, and making pictures were seen as closely related if not identical concepts. In both the Mayan and Aztec languages there is one word for writing and drawing ((tl√†cuiloa in Nahuatl and tz'iib' in Classic Maya)) Pictures are sometimes read phonetically and texts meant to be read are sometimes very pictorial in nature. This makes it difficult for modern day scholars to distinguish between whether an inscription in a Mesoamerican script represents spoken language or is to be interpreted as a descriptive drawing. The only Mesoamerican people known without doubt to have developed a completely glottographic or phonetic script is the Maya, and even the Mayan script is largely pictorial and often shows fuzzy boundaries between images and text. Scholars disagree on the phoneticity of other Mesoamerican scripts and iconographic styles, but many show use of the Rebus principle and a highly conventionalised set of symbols. Monumental Inscriptions A monumental inscription in Maya hieroglyphics from the site of Naranjo, relating to the reign of king Itzamnaaj K'awil The monumental inscriptions were often historical records of the citystates: Famous examples include: *Hieroglyphic Stair of Copan recording the history of Copan with 7000 glyphs on its 62 steps. *The inscriptions of Naj Tunich records the arrival of noble pilgrims to the sacred cave. *The tomb inscriptions of Pacal the famous ruler of Palenque. *The many stelae of Yaxchilan, Quirigu√°, Cop√°n, Tikal and Palenque and countless other Mayan archaeological sites. The function of these kinds of historical inscriptions also served to consoliate the power of the rulers who used them also as a kind of propaganda testimonies to their power. Most commonly monumental hieroglyphocal texts describe: *Lordship: ascension and death of rulers, and the claiming of ancestry from noble lineages *Warfare: Victories and conquest *Alliances: Marriages between lineages. *Dedications of monuments and buildings The epigrapher David Stuart writes about the differences in content between the monumental hieroglyphical texts of Yaxchilan and those of Copan: :\\"The major themes of the known Yaxchilan monuments are war, dance, and bloodletting rituals, with several records of architectural dedicatory rites.\\" Most of the records of wars and dances accompany scenes of the rulers, who are featured prominently in all of the texts. Cop√°n's texts have a far lesser emphasis on historical narrative. The stelae of the great plaza, for example, are inscribed with dedicatory formulae that name the ruler as \\"owner\\" of the monument, but they seldom if ever record any ritual or historical activity. Birth dates at Cop√°n are virtually nonexistent, as also are records of war and capture. The Cop√°n rulers therefore lack some of the personalized history we read in the texts of newer centers in the western lowlands, such as Palenque, Yaxchilan, and Piedras Negras.\\"David Stuart, David Stuart writes about the inscriptions of Cop√°n A page of the Precolumbian Mayan Dresden Codex Codices ;: See also Mayan codices and Aztec codices for fuller descriptions of a number of codices. Most codices date from the colonial era, with only a few surviving from the prehispanic era.

For example, drinking vessels with the inscription saying \\"The Cacao drinking cup of X\\" or similar. Postconquest literatures written in Latin script Aztec feather artisans or painters. Florentine Codex (ca. 1576) with native drawings and Nahuatl text The largest part of the Mesoamerican literature today known has been fixed in writing after the Spanish conquest. Both Europeans and Mayans began writing down local oral tradition using the Latin alphabet to write in indigenous languages shortly after the conquest. Many of those Europeans were friars and priests who in trying to convert the natives to Christianity. They translated Catholic catechisms and confessional manuals and acquired a good grasp of the indigenous languages and often even composed grammars and dictionaries of the indigenous languages. These early grammars of native languages systematized the reading and writing of indigenous languages in their own time and help us understand them today. The most widely known early grammars and dictionaries are of the Aztec language, Nahuatl. Famous examples are the works written by Alonso de Molina and Andr√©s de Olmos. But also Mayan and other Mesoamerican languages have early grammars and dictionaries, some of very high quality. The introduction of the Latin alphabet and the elaboration of conventions for writing indigenous languages allowed for the subsequent creation of a wide range of texts. And indigenous writers took advantage of the new techniques to document their own history and tradition in the new writing, while monks kept on extending literacy in the indigenous population. This tradition lasted only a few centuries however and due to royal decrees about Spanish being the only language of the Spanish empire by the mid-1700s most indigenous languages were left without a living tradition for writing. Oral literature, however, kept being transmitted to this day in many indigenous languages and began to be collected by ethnologists in the beginnings of the 20th century, however without promoting native language literacy in the communities in which they worked. It is an important and extremely difficult job in the Mesoamerica of today, and what that is only beginning to be undertaken, to return native language literacy to the indigenous peoples. But during the first post- conquest centuries a large number of texts in indigenous Mesoamerican languages were generated. Codices of major importance Founding of Tenochtitlan, Codex Mendoza. ::*Codex Mendoza ::*Florentine Codex. A twelve- volume work composed under the direction of Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n and sent to Europe in 1576. Separate books deal with Aztec religion, divinatory practices; lords and rulers; elite long-distance merchants pochteca; commoners; the \\"earthly things\\" including a compendium of information on flora and fauna; rocks and soil types. Volume 12 is a history of the conquest from the Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco viewpont. It is called the \\"Florentine Codex\\" because it was found in a library in Florence, Italy. Historical accounts Conquistador Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n as depicted in the annalCodex Telleriano Remensis Many of the post-conquest texts are historical accounts, either in the form of annals recounting year by year the events of a people or city-state often based on pictorial documents or oral accounts of aged community members. But also sometimes personalized literary accounts of the life of a people or state and almost always incorporating both mythical material and actual history. There was no formal distinction between the two in Mesoamerica. Sometimes as in the case of the Mayan Chilam Balam books historical accounts also incorporated prophetical material, a kind of history in advance.

In order to obtain any kinds of favorable positions pleas and petitions had to be made to the new authorities and land possessions and heritages had to be proven. This resulted in a large corpus of administrative literature in indigenous languages, because documents were often written in the native language first and later translated into Spanish. Historians of central Mexican peoples draw heavily on native-language documentation, most notably Charles Gibson in The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule (1964)Charles Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Stanford University Press 1964. and James Lockhart in The Nahuas After the Conquest (1992).James Lockhart, The Nahuas After the Conquest. Stanford University Press 1992 The emphasis on native-language documentation for indigenous history has been emphasized in the New Philology.Matthew Restall, \\"A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History\\", Latin American Research Review - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp. 113‚Äì134Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory, James Lockhart, Lisa Sousa, and Stephanie Wood (eds.), Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). These administrative documents include a large number of: Oztoticpac Lands Map *Testaments (legal wills of individual indigenous, sometimes kept together as books of testaments). Testaments have been utilized as a source of information on individuals, and where they appear as clusters, they give even fuller information about indigenous culture, kin relations, and economic practices. Starting in 1976, testaments have been published as an example of the potential of Mesoamerican native-language documentation, part of what is currently called the New Philology. A number collections of wills have been published, including four volumes resulting from a Mexican government-funded project La vida cotidiana ind√≠gena y su transformaci√≥n en la √©poca colonial a trav√©s de los testamentos.Teresa Rojas Rabiela, et al.Vidas y bienes olvidados: Testamentos indigenas novohispanos. (Mexico: CIESAS/CONACYT 1999-2002) Some particularly rich collections of wills have been published, followed by a monograph utilizing them. In recent years, anthologies of indigenous testaments have been published from Mesoamerica and elsewhere. **The Testaments of Culhuacan, a set sixteenth-century wills bound together as a book, concentrated in the 1580sS.L.

Relaciones geogr√°ficas In the late sixteenth-century the Spanish crown sought systematic information about indigenous settlements now part of the Spanish Empire. A questionnaire was drawn up and local Spanish officials gathered information from the indigenous towns under their administration, using local elites as their informants. Some reports were a few pages, such as that from Culhuacan, while some major indigenous polities, such as Tlaxcala, took the opportunity to give a detailed description of their prehispanic history and participation in the Spanish conquest of central Mexico. Most geographical accounts include a native map of the settlement. The Relaciones geogr√°ficas were produced because colonial officials complied with royal instructions, but their content was generated by indigenous informants or authors.Howard F.

Mundy, The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geogr√°ficas. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1996. Mythological narratives The most extensively researched Mesoamerican indigenous literature is the literature containing mythological and legendary narratives. The styles of these books is often very poetic and appealing to modern aesthetic senses both because of the poetic language and its \\"mystical\\", exotic contents. It is also of interest to establish intertextuality between cultures. While many do include actual historic events the mythological texts can often be distinguished by focusing on claiming a mythical source to power by tracing the lineage of a people to some ancient source of power. *Popol Vuh (the legendary mythological history of the Quich√© people) *Codex Chimalpopoca (the main source of the Aztec creation myth of the Five Suns) *Codex Aubin (recounting the mythical wanderings of the Mexica from Aztlan and to Tenochtitlan) *Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca (the Aztec myth of the legendary Toltec and Chichimec peoples) Poetry Some famous collections of Aztec poetry have been conserved. Although written in the late 16th century they are believed to be fairly representative of the actual style of poetry used in precolumbian times. Many of the poems are attributed to named Aztec rulers such as Nezahualcoyotl. Because the poems were transcribed at a later date, scholars dispute whether these are the actual authors. Many of the mythical and historical texts also have poetic qualities.

A prime example of this are the Yucatec Mayan Books of Chilam Balam, mentioned above for their historical content, but also containing treatises on medical lore, astrology, etc. Although clearly belonging to Maya literature, they are profoundly syncretic in nature.

On display at the Shoe Museum in Lausanne. Line art drawing of a chopine. A chopine is a type of women's platform shoe that was popular in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Chopines were originally used as a patten, clog, or overshoe to protect the shoes and dress from mud and street soil. Chopines were popularly worn in Venice by both courtesans and patrician women from c. 1400 to 1700. Besides their practical uses, the height of the chopine became a symbolic reference to the cultural and social standing of the wearer; the higher the chopine, the higher the status of the wearer.Coryat Thomas, Crudities (London, 1611) ed. 1905, p. 400. High chopines allowed a woman to tower over others. During the Renaissance, chopines became an article of women's fashion and were made increasingly taller; some extant examples are over 20 inches (50 cm) high.The tallest extant chopines are in the Museo Correr in Venice, Italy. In 1430, the height of chopines was limited by Venetian law to three inches, but this regulation was widely ignored. Shakespeare joked about the extreme height of the chopines in style in his day by using the word altitude (Hamlet 2.2, the prince greets one of the visiting players ‚Äì the adolescent boy who would have played the female parts in the all-male troupe ‚Äì by noting how much \\"nearer to heaven\\" the lad had grown since he last saw him \\"by the altitude of a chopine\\"). Surviving chopines are typically made of wood or cork, and those in the Spanish style were sometimes banded about with metal. Extant pieces are covered with leather, brocades, or jewel-embroidered velvet. Often, the fabric of the chopine matched the dress or the shoe, but not always. However, despite being highly decorated, chopines were often hidden under the wearer's skirt and were hidden from any critical observation. Although due to the design of the shoes, they caused the wearer to have a very \\"comical walk\\". According to some scholars, chopines caused an unstable and inelegant gait. Noblewomen wearing them were generally accompanied by two servants in order to walk around safely, by supporting themselves on the servants' shoulders.Bossan, Marie-Jos√®phe. \\"The Renaissance\\". The Art of the Shoe. Trans. Rebecca Brimacombe. New York: Parkstone, 2012. p. 35. via Google Books. Parkstone International, 08 May 2012. Web. 02 May 2014. <https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&pg;=PA35&dq;=chopines shoes&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=SDhkU_q3H5DZoAS4hoKQAw&ved;=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q;=chopines shoes&f;=false>. Other scholars have argued that with practice a woman could walk and even dance gracefully.Barbara Ravelhofer, The Early Stuart Masque: Dance, Costume, and Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 113, fn 47. In his dancing manual Nobilit√† di dame (1600), the Italian dancing master Fabritio Caroso writes that with care a woman practiced in wearing her chopines could move ‚Äúwith grace, seemliness, and beauty‚Äù and even \\"dance flourishes and galliard variations\\".Fabritio Caroso, Nobilit√† di dame (Venice, 1600), translated as Courtly Dance of the Renaissance: Nobilit√† di dame, ed. and trans. Julia Sutton and F. Marian Walker (New York, 1995), p. 141. Chopines were usually put on with the help of two servants. In the 15th century, chopines were also the style in Spain. Their popularity in Spain was so great that the larger part of the nation's cork supplies went towards production of the shoes. Some argue that the style originated in Spain, as there are many extant examples and a great amount of pictorial and written reference going back to the 14th century.Anderson, Ruth Matilda. Hispanic costume, 1480-1530. Chopines of the Spanish style were more often conical and symmetric, while their Venetian counterparts are much more artistically carved. Turkish sources claim the origin of the ornate Venetian chopines were nalins developed for turkish baths. That is not to say, however, that Spanish chopines were not adorned; on the contrary, there is evidence of jeweling, gilt lettering along the surround (the material covering the cork or wooden base), tooling, and embroidery on Spanish chopines. There are a great many cognates of the word chopine (chapiney, choppins, etc.). However, neither the word chopine nor any word similar to it (chioppino, cioppino, etc.) appears in Florio's dictionaries of either 1598 or 1611. The Italian word, instead, seems to be \\"zoccoli\\", which likely comes from the Italian word \\"zocco,\\" meaning a stump or a block of wood. Florio does, however, use the word \\"chopinos\\" in his English definition of zoccoli.

Camp The low-security detention center was established to house former LTTE cadres. Of the 26 killed, 2 were under the age of 21 and the rest were between 21 and 30. The massacre On October 24, 2000, a mob of a few hundred villagers armed with knives, rods and torches stormed the detention center. The Sri Lankan Army detachment that was posted there had been withdrawn the previous day, for unknown reasons. Once the massacre started, the posted police personnel refused to intervene to stop it. Government response Initially, the government responded by saying that the detainees had rioted and that the massacre was an outcome of an attempt to control the rioting. Then it was claimed that the police were unable to protect the detainees in the face of superior mob force. Eventually, the government charged a few police officers with a crime. Most were initially convicted of murder, only to be released by the Sri Lankan Supreme Court in 2005. Theories A number of theories have been postulated to explain the massacre: * It was organized by local Sinhala nationalist political activists with the connivance of Sri Lankan Army and police personnel. * It was a reaction by the local villagers who resented the detention center in their neighborhood. * It was organized by the military establishment to thwart an attempt by the detainees to go on hunger strike in the subsequent days to protest their detention.

Similar attractions under varying names can be found at two other Disney Parks, including Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland. It plays organ-based versions of Disney music during the two-minute ride period. Hand-painted scenes from Cinderella can be seen on the top; hence the name \\"Prince Charming\\". Magic Kingdom version The carousel was originally built by The Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1917. It was originally known as \\"The Liberty Carousel\\", (PTC #46) and delivered to Belle Isle Park in Detroit, Michigan. Liberty originally had a 60-foot platform, 72 wooden horses, four chariots and sleighs, and seated 99 passengers, five abreast. It was moved to Olympic Park in Irvington, New Jersey, and in 1967 the Walt Disney Company purchased it. Arrow Development, in which Disney had purchased a 1/3 interest in 1960 and which had restored the King Arthur Carousel for Disneyland, produced new engineering drawings for the mechanism and horses. It was shipped to California, where the horses were stripped and each given a unique design. Molds were made of 18 horses to make fiberglass copies for a new Disney carousel being built for Tokyo Disneyland and also to serve as temporary stand-ins when original wood horses are taken down for repairs. Disney also added a 23 karat gold leaf, silver, and bronze to each of the horses and added scenes from Cinderella's story. The carousel was in place when the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, opened in 1971. While it was extensively refurbished and repainted in 1967 to match the Cinderella theme, maidens from the original design can still be seen on the top. All ninety horses are painted white because white horses are typically associated with heroes. All of the original horses were carved from maple. One chariot that was originally installed on \\"The Liberty\\" was lost during the refurbishment, but was rediscovered and installed in 1997. While the carousel was being installed at the Magic Kingdom, Roy Disney noticed that the placement was off center with the Cinderella Castle breezeway, and it was moved eight inches so it would be center. Cinderella's Horse There are conflicting stories regarding whether one of the horses is \\"Cinderella's Horse\\". The horse in question is in the second rank, and is the only one that has a golden bow on its tail. Cast Members have referred to it as Cinderella's as well as in various Disney publications. Cinderella has been depicted as riding a horse in various pieces of collectable sculpture and artwork, such as a 2001 Limited Edition lithograph. However, in an interview with Isle Voght, a park employee responsible for restoring the carousel along with John Hench, she gives her own reasons for doubting the veracity of the Cinderella's Horse story, namely that Cinderella would not have one on an inner row, and that it would be decorated much more elaborately than the others. Also, she states that Cinderella never rode one in the film. The Disney Imagineers did not include the story of Cinderella's horse in the 2010 rewriting of the carousel backstory. Name change On June 1, 2010 the name was changed from Cinderella's Golden Carousel to Prince Charming Regal Carousel. The name change helps tell the rest of the Cinderella story that inspired the carousel. Here's the official story behind it: Hong Kong Disneyland version The carousel was built by Chance Rides. It came with four rows of Bradley and Kaye horses and Columbia chariots. Disneyland Paris versionIn popular culture *In the Mickey Mouse episode \\"Potatoland\\", Mickey and Donald build a theme park called Potatoland to fulfill Goofy's lifelong dream to go to the park, even though it never existed. One of the attractions featured was a low- budget carousel, similar to the carousels at Disney theme parks, with Mickey playing the organ, while Donald cranked the ride.

The BNU serial port driver was specifically targeted for use with early (late 1980s - 1990s) DOS-based BBS software. The reason for BNU and other similar enhanced serial port drivers was to provide better support for serial communications software than what was offered by the machine's BIOS and/or DOS being used on the machine. Having serial port support as provided by BNU and other similar drivers allowed the communications software programmers to spend more time on the actual applications instead of the depths and details of how to talk to the serial ports and the modems connected to them. Sending communications data across a modem link was a lot more involved than sending data to a serial printer which was basically all that was originally capable of being done with the existing serial port software support. BNU was written by David Nugent as an experimental driver for serial communications following the FOSSIL specification. David released BNU to the public in 1989 and its use in the BBS world spread rapidly. BNU was one of only two or three available FOSSIL drivers for the IBM PC compatible hardware and MS-DOS/PC DOS operating system. Because of this, BNU has been one of the most widely used MS-DOS FOSSIL communications drivers. BNU was mainly used with DOS-based Bulletin Board System (BBS) software written in the late 1980s to mid-1990s. It is not used by Windows-based BBS software, but BNU can be used under Windows NTVDM to run DOS-based BBS software under Windows. BNU and other similar drivers were not limited solely to being used in the BBS world. The enhanced capabilities they offered were also used to easily communicate with other serially connected devices for the same reasons that the FOSSIL specification and FOSSIL drivers were originally created. That reason, as noted above, was to separate the details of serial port communications from the actual application. The software's programmers only needed to talk to the serial driver in a standardized way to send and receive their data. The name \\"BNU\\" was originally a rip-off of AT&T;'s \\"BNU UUCP\\", and in that context meant \\"Basic Networking Utilities\\". The author of BNU, David Nugent, felt that the acronym was particularly apt for BNU's function. BNU was also called \\"Bloody Nugent's Utility\\" because it was written by David Nugent as one of his many BBS related utilities and it was not known at the time what the acronym \\"BNU\\" actually stood for. The BNUFAQ used to be posted in the Fidonet BNU support echo by the author. This saved text file is the last official posting of this FAQ by David Nugent, BNU's author.

Each group has a Court of Honour/Patrol Leader's Council which under the guidance of an adult Scouter designs and implements activities. Scouts is the section where activities begin to really challenge the youth member and impart responsibility and self-reliance in accordance with the Scout method and the educational philosophy of Baden-Powell. The association also currently has Sea Scout and Air Scout programmes. The highest award is the Chief Scout Award Scout Awards Scout progressive badge scheme (former CSI). Clockwise from bottom Tracker Award, Explorer Award, National Award, Star Award. Until a new programme is introduced, many Scout troops are continuing to use the programme of Scouting Ireland (CSI). Some other troops continue to use the programme of Scouting Ireland S.A.I., which includes the Attainment badge scheme. In the former CSI programme, in addition to merit badges, the programme has a progress award scheme consisting of five awards. The first award is the Tracker Award. It is completed before a Scout is invested. It requires Scouts to have a basic knowledge of Scoutcraft (navigation, ropework and cooking), show a commitment to their patrol and troop and to understand certain aspects of Scouting (uniform, promise, law, award scheme, Scouting trail etc.). The tracker award badge (a green diamond with a stag on it) is the first badge a Scout can earn. After this Scouts can continue the award scheme. The next step is the Explorer Award. This award is considered the standard of Scouting skills. It has several sections (Scouting Knowledge, Scoutcraft, campcraft, pathfinding, health, cooking, culture, community, duty to beliefs). Most of the requirements can be completed during patrol/troop activities. The Court of Honour decides if the Scout deserves the award. The explorer award is a red diamond with a compass on it. The third part is the star Scout award. To earn the award you need: * The explorer award (or certain combinations of the explorer award sections) * Camper and Emergencies merit badges * either the hiker, water activities or air activities badges * 7 other merit badges (1 each from campcraft, Scoutcraft, service, adventure, faith/environment, Physical Ability) * Either the faith or scripture badge * to take part in a county event The star Scout badge is a black diamond with a yellow staff on it. It is usually presented in a ceremony. The fourth part is the National Scout Award. To take part a Scout needs to apply to National Office. The requirements for the NSA are as follows: * Star Scout Award * Leadership Award * Hike Leader or Camp Leader badge * Social Awareness or Conservation badge * World Friendship badge * Participate in a national event When applying Scouts need to submit 3 hike logs or 2 camp logs and the social awareness/conservation badge work. The NSA is always presented in a ceremony. The four badges combined to make a large diamond as illustrated. The final part is the Chief Scout Award which is considered the highest honour a Scout can get. There's also the Leadership award which tests the leadership ability of the Scouts. This is often earned as part of a PL training course. Troop Structure Scouts are divided up in patrols and troops. 6-8 Scouts make up a patrol. The patrol is the main unit of the Scout programme and most activities are done in the patrol. The patrol is led by an older Scout known as a patrol leader (pl). He is helped by an assistant patrol leader. All other members of the patrol are given jobs (e.g. cook, first aider, scribe). The patrol system encourages teamwork and youth leadership. A standard troop is made up of 20-32 Scouts (divided into 3-4 patrols) under the leadership of a group of Adult Scouters. The PLs come together in Court of Honour/Patrol Leaders Council to help the Scouters run the troop. The highlight of the Scouting year is the troop annual camp which usually takes place at summer time The Phoenix Trophy The Phoenix Patrol Challenge The Phoenix Patrol Challenge is the national Scoutcraft competition. It is organised by the National Events Team. Patrols of 8 members qualify from their respective Scout Counties to reach the 4 day event. Patrols combine traditional Scout skills with team games. Tasks vary from year to year, with pioneering, water activities, hiking, bivouacking and crafts. There are separate prizes for Campcraft, Cooking, Health & Safety, activity bases and special projects and the coveted overall winners' prize. The Phoenix evolved from the Melvin competition of Scouting Ireland (CSI) and the Smythe Cup of Scouting Ireland S.A.I..

It is situated in Tap Shek Kok, Tuen Mun District, on the north shore of Urmston Road. Its name came from the mountain Castle Peak nearby. The station consists of four 350 MW and four 677 MW generating units, with auxiliary facilities. It was commissioned in 1982 with its newest generation unit installed in 1990. It is one of the three power stations that CLP operates in Hong Kong, totalling to 6,908 MW of installed capacity. In 2007 Castle Peak burned 9 million tonnes of coal of which, according to CLP, 4.6 million tonnes was low-sulphur coal from Indonesia. The power station has been undertaking a range of programmes to improve emission performance, including refurbishing burners to reduce emission of nitrogen oxide, SCR (Selective Catalyst Reduction) and BOFA (Boosted Over Fire Air) has been installed, and Flue-gas desulfurization for sulphur removal. This power station is a major contributor to non-motor-traffic pollution in Hong Kong. History The Castle Peak \\"A\\" Power Station was officially opened by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on 28 September 1982. The site was designed with provision for construction of a \\"B\\" power station at a later date. It was decided to go ahead with the Castle Peak \\"B\\" Power Station in 1981. This was built by the Castle Peak Power Company, a joint venture between CLP and Esso. The first two (of four) units were inaugurated by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 22 October 1986. Ownership The station is owned by Castle Peak Power Company (Capco) which also owns the Black Point Power Station and the Penny's Bay Power Station. Initially CLP held a 40% stake (60% held by ExxonMobil) in Capco. The total power generation capacity of the three power station amounts to 6,908 MW. On 19 November 2013, CLP Group and China Southern Power Grid Company (CSG) announced its acquisition of Exxon's 60% stake in Capco for HK$24 billion. After the transaction, CLP holds a 70% stake while CSG holds the remaining 30% stake.Stronger relationship up north set to spark expansion The transaction was said to help CLP lower its emission to meet its target in 2020, by importing more clean energy through CSG's grid. The transaction was expected to be completed in 2014. After the transaction, Exxon would exit the power generation business in Hong Kong, its only such investment worldwide. Future plans CLP is building a gas-fired generation unit at the nearby Black Point Power Station. After this is commissioned around 2023, two coal- fired generating units at Castle Peak are planned to be decommissioned.

It started on 7 August 2006 in the province of Jujuy. Mal√≥n is a word derived from Mapudungun and refers to a surprise incursion, as practised by the native tribes attacking creole settlements in the past. Therefore the expression means \\"Peace Incursion\\". The first Mal√≥n de la Paz was a 2,000 km march from Jujuy to Buenos Aires in 1946, to present land and human rights claims to President Juan Per√≥n. The Second Mal√≥n de la Paz was triggered by the long delay and refusal of the provincial government of Jujuy to comply with a judicial order granting the indigenous communities 15,000 km¬≤ of land. An assembly of members of different communities gathered in Abra Pampa, 200 km north of San Salvador de Jujuy (the same place where, 60 years before, the first Mal√≥n started). Following the resolutions of the assembly, a number of delegates from the communities scattered around the province marched from the Quebrada de Humahuaca to Purmamarca (60 km north of the provincial capital). After a new assembly, on 8 August around 1,000 people blockaded National Routes 16 and 9, and demanded to be heard by governor Eduardo Fellner. The blockade is slated to last indefinitely. History The first Mal√≥n de Paz was not well received by the national government. Although the marchers got the attention and support of the people in the way, as well as formal acknowledgment by President Per√≥n, they were soon expelled from Buenos Aires empty-handed. Only three years later, in 1949, the national government expropriated some lands to be granted to the indigenous communities, but the cession was never performed. The 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution recognized the rights of the \\"originary peoples\\" to own their ancient lands. According to the delegates of the communities, in 1996 the national government started sending funds to Jujuy to handle the surveys and paperwork needed to make the lands property of the originary communities, but only 7 out of 123 collective property titles have been granted to them. On 2 May 2003, justice ordered that the papers had to be delivered within no more than 15 months. The provincial government appealed the decision. The originary communities were displeased by this, and sent a letter to President N√©stor Kirchner. The drastic measure of blocking national roads was called by the press \\"an ultimatum\\" to the provincial authorities. References * P√°gina/12. 9 August 2006.

The site was originally operated by the Atlas Powder Company during World War II from 1941 to 1945 to produce explosives. The Atomic Energy Commission acquired part of the property in 1955, and Mallinckrodt, Inc. processed uranium ore from 1957 to 1966 under contract. The site has been divided into several parcels, and ownership has transferred over the years. Two portions of the original WSOW property are now Superfund sites that require substantial cleanup efforts. The environmental remediation of the WSOW site is currently designated as a major project of the Defense Environmental Restoration Program of the United States Department of Defense. Part of the original property is still used by the Army Reserve as the Weldon Spring Training Area. Weldon Spring Ordnance Works The site was purchased in 1941, totaling of largely rural land. The towns of Hamburg, Howell, and Toonerville and around 700 citizens of the area were displaced beginning in 1940 and ending the following year. From 1941 to 1945, the Atlas Powder Company manufactured trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) at the site. Four TNT and two DNT production lines were situated on what was to be the Chemical Plant. These operations resulted in nitroaromatic contamination of soil, sediments, and some off-site springs. After World War II, over were transferred to the State of Missouri, including the August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area. Additional land was transferred to the University of Missouri, St. Charles County, and the Francis Howell School District. Much of the land that was transferred to the University of Missouri has become the Weldon Spring Conservation Area. Weldon Spring Chemical Plant Following a considerable amount of environmental remediation of the facility by the U.S. Army and the Atlas Powder Company, of the former ordnance works were transferred to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1955 for construction of the Weldon Spring Uranium Feed Materials Plant, now referred to as the Weldon Spring Chemical Plant. Mallinckrodt, Inc. operated the plant from 1957 to 1966 under a contract with the AEC. An additional were transferred to the AEC in 1964. The plant converted processed uranium ore concentrates to uranium tetrafluoride, uranium trioxide, intermediate compounds, and uranium metal. A small amount of thorium was also processed. Wastes generated during these operations were stored in four raffinate pits located on the plant property. Uranium processing operations resulted in radiological contamination of the area. Uranium processing operations ceased in 1966, and on December 31, 1967, the AEC returned the facility to the Army for use as a defoliant production plant. The defoliant project was canceled before any process equipment was installed, and the Army transferred of land encompassing the raffinate pits back to the AEC while retaining the Chemical Plant. The AEC, and subsequently the United States Department of Energy (DOE), managed the site, including the Army-owned Chemical Plant, under caretaker status from 1968 through 1985. In 1984, the Army repaired several of the buildings at the Chemical Plant, decontaminated some of the floors, walls, and ceilings, and isolated some equipment. In 1985, the Army transferred full custody of the Chemical Plant to the United States Department of Energy (DOE), at which time the DOE designated control and decontamination of the Chemical Plant, raffinate pits, and Quarry as a major project. The DOE legacy management web site has additional documentation on the status of the site. Weldon Spring Quarry The Weldon Spring Quarry was mined for limestone aggregate used in construction of the ordnance works. The Army also used the quarry for burning wastes from explosives manufacturing and disposal of TNT- contaminated rubble during operation of the ordnance works. These activities resulted in contamination of the soil and groundwater at the quarry. In 1958, the Army transferred the Weldon Spring Quarry to the Atomic Energy Commission, who used it from 1959 to 1966 as a disposal area for uranium, thorium, and radium residues from the Chemical Plant (both drummed and uncontained) and for disposal of contaminated building rubble, process equipment, and soils from demolition of a uranium processing facility in St. Louis. Radiological contamination occurred in the same locations as the nitroaromatic contamination. Weldon Spring Training Area By 1959, with the majority of the site already transferred out of government hands, was redeveloped as for the U.S. Army Reserve as the Weldon Spring Training Area. Superfund sites The stairway to an observation platform atop the permanent disposal cell at the Weldon Spring cleanup site is open to the public. Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits (USDOE/Army) site On October 15, 1984, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed listing the portions of the Weldon Spring area contaminated with radioactive waste on the National Priorities List. The site was finally listed on July 22, 1987. The Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits (USDOE/Army) site covers and is located between the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The site includes the disposal area, the abandoned Uranium Feed Materials Plant, various smaller properties, and the former limestone quarry located 4 miles from the plant. Primary contaminants of concern at the Chemical Plant and surrounding soil include uranium, thorium, radium, and their radioactive decay products. The quarry contains materials contaminated with TNT and DNT residues, as well as uranium, thorium, and radium residues and contaminated materials and equipment. The quarry is located from the St. Charles County well field, which is used as a drinking water source for approximately 70,000 people. Weldon Spring Former Army Ordnance Works site On July 14, 1989, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed adding the Weldon Spring Ordnance Works to the National Priorities List. The site was officially listed on February 21, 1990. Contaminated areas are spread throughout the site, with the greatest concentration in the Training Area. Areas of concern include seven unlined lagoons where TNT wastewater was stored, TNT production lines, two DNT production lines, drainage ditches below TNT production lines, and eight areas where explosive wastes were burned. The primary contaminants of concern at the site are TNT, DNT, and lead. These contaminants have been identified in soil at several areas on the site, and TNT was detected in 1987 in surface water downstream of the lagoons. Portions of the August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area are within the Weldon Spring Former Army Ordnance Works site.

The power station is operated by CLP Group. History In the late 1980s, China Light and Power (CLP) examined several potential sites for the construction of a new power station. The company came to favour Fan Lau in southern Lantau Island, but this was rejected by the government for environmental reasons, particularly the effects the station would have on Lantau South Country Park. On 20 August 1990, the company announced that it had instead proposed to the government to build the station at Black Point. The power station was commissioned in stages between 1996 and 2006. Operations The station provides 2,575 MW of power. The complex consists of two halls with four turbines in each hall producing cleaner power when compared to coal. The last turbine was completed in 2006. Since its commissioning, gas is provided from a gas well 750 km south of Hong Kong, in the South China Sea. CLP plans to increase usage of gas for its local generation when more gas becomes available, this change is in line with the Hong Kong Government‚Äôs proposed enhancements to the Air Quality Objectives and Climate Change Strategy.

Part of me thinks I'm an idiot for 'wasting' this recording on a limited release EP, but i'm really into this method of recording and releasing quickly and making it all about music, so here it is.\\" Regarding \\"All U Can Eat\\", Ben explains, \\"When it was an embryo of a song, I played it at a few gigs and called it 'they give no fuck'. The bulk of the song was written the day it was recorded and I realized it should be called 'all you can eat'. I've always said I'd write one love song and one political song. I think this is about as political as I care to be in my music.\\" Ben comments on \\"There's Always Someone Cooler Than You.\\" \\"It's about anybody who elevates themselves through making someone else feel like they aren't up on something, or that they try too hard or that they're too interested or they tuck their shirt in when they're not supposed to. There's always someone cooler than that person too. You see soccer moms now dressed in ringer tees kinda looking like Sonic Youth from 10 years ago, and it's not that becoming on them.\\" Track listingReferences *^ Suddath, Clair, \\"Ben Folds Is Not Cooler Than You,\\" pg 41, Nashville Scene, November 2, 2006. 2003 EPs Ben Folds EPs ","title":"Sunny 16 (EP)"},{"id":"6358585","text":"Snowdon Hill Quarry () is a 0.6 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the western outskirts of Chard in Somerset, notified in 1963.

The wreck is of a type of vessel known as a collier brig which would have been ubiquitous in the 18th and 19th Centuries and is unusual on the North-East coast for the high degree of preservation. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by The noticeboard explaining the protected wreck at Seaton Carew Discovery On 4 August 1996, two local people, Derek Hodgson and Joe Howey reported discovering the remains of a wreck on Seaton Carew beach. The wreck had not been seen before, at least in their lifetimes, but a recent storm, some 3 or 4 days before had stripped sand from the beach and exposed the wreck. They contacted Tees Archaeology,Tees Archaeology Description of finding the wreck who began a rapid assessment of the wreckTees Archaeology Report of initial survey, 1996 with the help of volunteers from the Nautical Archaeology Society. The wreck was lying in the inter-tidal zone about half way between the high and low water levels, giving about 6 hours for assessment between tides. It quickly became clear that what the sea had revealed, the sea was again going to conceal, as, with each tide, the sand was gradually returning to cover the wreck. Description The wreck lies with her bows towards the shore. It is approximately 25m long and 7m broad. The frames are oak and fastened with treenails. It appears to be of a type of vessel known as a collier brig, a sturdy type of vessel favoured by Captain James Cook for his voyages of exploration. It appears to have been subject to salvage as frames have been cut off to a consistent level, leaving the remains of the masts and lower third of the hull.Advisory Committee on Historic Wrecks Report for 1998 Damage to the port side near the stern may have been made as part of the salvage operation to remove its cargo, possibly of coal. A photograph taken by a local priest, James Pattison in 1898 appears to show the same wreck with the hull salvaged but the stern post still intact.Northern Echo 28 September 2004 Designation The importance of the wreck was recognised by the designation on 8 August 1997 under the Protection of Wrecks Act.Statutory instrument protecting the wreck The original interpretation panel erected near the site in August 2000Advisory Committee on Historic Wrecks Report for 1999-2000 was replaced by a new panel in 2005.

They were located in Evansville, Indiana, and played their home games at Bosse Field. The Triplets served as a farm club for three major league franchises: the Minnesota Twins (1970), Milwaukee Brewers (1971‚Äì1973), and Detroit Tigers (1974‚Äì1984). The Triplets were established in 1970 as an expansion team in conjunction with the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion. In 1984, the team was sold to Larry Schmittou and other owners of the Nashville Sounds of the Double-A Southern League, who relocated the team to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1985. Over 15 seasons of play, Evansville played in 2,061 regular season games and compiled a win‚Äìloss record of 1,032‚Äì1,026‚Äì3 (.501). They reached the postseason on four occasions. They won the American Association championship in 1972 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. They later won two additional American Association titles with the Detroit Tigers (1975 and 1979). The 1975 club also won the Junior World Series. The Triplets had an overall postseason record of 16‚Äì8 (.667). History Due to the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion, there was a need for two additional Triple-A teams in the American Association for the 1970 season. One went to Wichita, Kansas, the other to Evansville, Indiana, which had previously hosted Minor League Baseball teams but never above the Double-A classification. A contest was held to select a name for the new franchise. \\"Evansville Triplets\\" was selected from over 3,000 entries. The fitting name refers to the team playing at the Triple-A level and that the team would represent not just Indiana, but the entire tri-state area, including Kentucky and Illinois. It was also a word play on the Minnesota Twins, Evansville's first major league affiliate. The new team would play at Bosse Field, which opened in 1915. After spending their inaugural 1970 season affiliated with the Minnesota Twins, Evansville then spent the next three seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1972, the Triplets won their first American Association championship against their expansion partner, the Wichita Aeros, 3‚Äì0. Lloyd Gladden won the 1972 American Association Most Valuable Pitcher Award having pitched to a 15‚Äì9 record with a 2.71 earned run average and 141 strikeouts. The Triplets enjoyed their greatest success as the top minor league affiliate of the Detroit Tigers from 1974 to 1984. The team won their second AA title in 1975 by defeating the Denver Bears, 4‚Äì2. They went on to win the Junior World Series, 4‚Äì1, against the Tidewater Tides. Manager Fred Hatfield won the 1975 American Association Manager of the Year Award. Les Moss won the same award in 1978). Under Manager of the Year Jim Leyland, the 1979 club won a third AA championship, 4‚Äì2, over the Oklahoma City 89ers. Billy Gardner was selected as the AA's 1980 Manager of the Year. In July 1984, the team's owners arrived at terms to sell the Triplets for a reported sum of US$780,000 to the owners of the Nashville Sounds, a Double-A club of the Southern League, who intended to move the franchise to Nashville, Tennessee, for the 1985 season. The Southern League wanted team president Larry Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field meant the end of affiliated baseball in Evansville. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the preceding Double-A team.

She has run for political office three times. In 2004, she was a Democratic candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat in Illinois, losing in the Democratic primary election to then-state senator Barack Obama. In 2006, she ran for the United States House of Representatives in Michigan's 9th congressional district in the 2006 elections, losing to the 14-year incumbent Republican, Joe Knollenberg. In 2014, she ran again for the House of Representatives, this time in Michigan's 11th congressional district, losing in the Democratic primary to Bobby McKenzie. In 2018 she again lost in the same primaries to Haley Stevens. Early life Skinner was born and raised in Royal Oak, Michigan. She graduated from the University of Michigan in 1987, receiving a BBA degree with an emphasis in finance and accounting. Urban development After graduation, Skinner worked for the family of businessman Mike Ilitch, helping to renovate Detroit's Fox Theatre and relocate the Little Caesars International (LCI) corporate headquarters to the Fox Office Building. She also worked on area redevelopment projects in Downtown Detroit, serving on the Grand Circus Park Redevelopment Board and helping plan for the theatre district's future. Environmentalism Following the great Midwestern floods of 1993, Skinner persuaded President Bill Clinton's White House to assemble a team of ten federal agencies and the nations' leading architects and engineers to rebuild two entire towns away from the floodplain using the principles of sustainable development. Their efforts were honored with an award from President Bill Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development.Eco-Pioneers: Practical Visionaries Solving Today's Environmental Problems, Steve Lerner, Chapter 14 Skinner helped launch the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), the first voluntary emissions trading program to address global climate change using free market principles. The exchange ran from 2003 to 2010. Radio commentator In 1998, Skinner began co-hosting a progressive weekend radio show called Ski & Skinner on WLS in Chicago where she was fired after announcing, on air, that she was running for the U.S. Senate. In 2000, Skinner became co-host of The Doug Stephan Show, a syndicated national morning show heard on over 400 radio stations across the United States. Skinner's show inspired two listeners, Anita and Sheldon Drobny, to create the Air America Radio Network featuring Al Franken and other liberal radio hosts. Since 1999, Skinner has been appearing regularly as a commentator on cable news channels CNN, MSNBC and the Fox News Channel. When she was offered the position of morning host at Detroit's progressive Air America talk radio station, WDTW 1310 AM, Skinner returned to her home state of Michigan, where she hosted morning drive. Skinner substituted for Randi Rhodes and hosted The Randi Rhodes Show from February 5, 2009, through February 13, 2009. On February 16, 2009, The Nancy Skinner Show debuted on the On Second Thought radio network, the successor to the Nova M Radio network. Political campaigns In 2004, Skinner ran for the U.S. Senate from Illinois, losing in the Democratic primary to Barack Obama. Skinner's 2006 campaign in Michigan's 9th district against Joe Knollenberg was initially seen as a long shot; as Knollenberg had double digits margins of victory and Skinner chose to run on the issue of climate change in the seat of the auto industry, where she was endorsed in an ad campaign by Robert Kennedy Jr. for her leadership on the issue. Though the race became more competitive in its final weeks, Knollenberg ultimately defeated Skinner 52 to 46 percent. After the election, Skinner took a position with the staff of First Gentleman Daniel Mulhern, husband of Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm and was on the Executive Team of Governor Jennifer Granholm. She resigned from this position and on October 16, 2007, Skinner officially announced that she was again running for the 9th congressional district. On February 25, 2008, however, Skinner announced that she was withdrawing from the race rather than face a contentious primary with former Michigan Lottery Commissioner Gary Peters. (Peters went on to win the election.) In 2014 Skinner ran again for the House of Representatives in Michigan's 11th congressional district. She came in 3rd in the Democratic primary, with 26.5% of the vote.

They play in the country's premier league, the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. History The roots of the team can be traced back to SG N√ºrnberg, an ice hockey club that played in the 2nd Bundesliga from 1958 until it was closed in 1980 due to financial issues. Today's team was founded in 1980 as EHC N√ºrnberg 1980 e.V., as a non-profit organization. Play started in 1980‚Äì81 in the Bavarian state ice-hockey league (). After a single season, the team moved up to the Southern Regional league (), and was promoted again after just one season in 1983 to the 3rd tier German Ice Hockey league (). By 1987, EHC N√ºrnberg 1980 moved up to the 2nd Bundesliga. In the early 1990s, financial uncertainty around German professional ice-hockey lead to the foundation of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga ‚Äì DEL. The DEL was modeled after the NHL, with hopes of providing financial stability through licensing and franchising of teams. EHC N√ºrnberg 1980 was admitted to the DEL as a founding member on 13 June 1994, one of 6 teams from the 2nd Bundesliga. As the DEL replaced the 1st Bundesliga and now represents the highest level of German professional ice-hockey, this in effect resulted in a promotion. In the first DEL season, the EHC 80 N√ºrnberg finished the regular season on the 12th place, only to be eliminated in the first playoff round. For the next season, the professional team was broken out of the non-profit organization and incorporated as the N√ºrnberg Ice Tigers, with the youth and amateurs keeping the old name.Auf den Spuren des EHC N√ºrnberg 1980 e.V., ehc80.eu In the 1998‚Äì99 DEL season the Tigers finished the regular season in first place, but lost in the playoff finals to the Adler Mannheim, who dominated German Ice Hockey in the late 1990s. In 2006, the Ice Tigers and Bionorica AG, signed a three-year agreement giving Bionorica the naming rights to the team. Starting with the 2006‚Äì07 DEL season, the team was renamed to Sinupret Ice Tigers, after a Bionorica product. During the 2008‚Äì09 season it became obvious that the Ice Tigers were in a dire financial situation. On 25 November 2008 preliminary insolvency was filed and declared on 30 December declared. This led to the corporate sponsor Bionorica pulling their support in March 2009.

The episode was written by Rafael Alvarez from a story by David Simon & Rafael Alvarez and was directed by Leslie Libman. It originally aired on October 31, 2004. Plot After a political event, Daniels' wife Marla raises the possibility of reconciling. However, Daniels explains that he cannot promise any more than his continued support of her career, later telling Pearlman that he feels he still owes her to fill the role of a supportive spouse. During a game of racquetball, Carcetti and Gray skirt around the issue of who should run against Mayor Royce, with Carcetti seemingly conceding that only a black person could win the race. Carcetti again asks D'Agostino to run his campaign, saying that Baltimore's black vote will be split if Royce and Gray both run. Royce and Parker suggest to Burrell that he may not keep his job as police commissioner if the city's crime rate keeps rising. In Homicide, Bunk tells Landsman that he will work on the double homicide of Tosha and Tank rather than wasting time on the missing gun; Landsman finally agrees. Bunk interviews Tosha's family and asks them to have Omar contact him. The word gets back to Omar, who catches up with the witness who identified him to Bunk and convinces him to change his story. Omar arranges a meeting with Bunk, telling him there is no victim in the case of the shooting. Bunk, enraged, talks about their shared past at Edmondson High School and says that the empathy and sense of community in their neighborhoods is all but gone. In the Western, Colvin has Carver and his other men forcibly relocate any straggling dealers into Hamsterdam. Despite the positive effect Hamsterdam has on the wider neighborhood, Colvin notices one resident remaining in the zone. When the resident refuses to move, Colvin approaches Foerster with the necessary paperwork, telling him the woman is a witness in a drug case. Colvin again finds himself relying on information from the Major Case Unit, and requests their assistance in targeting both the Barksdales and the Stanfields. Meanwhile, Bell and Avon are dismayed to find costs spiraling at their development site. They join Slim Charles in surveying territory. Avon questions why the Barksdales are conceding their best territory to Marlo without a fight and resolves to get his corners back. Bell and Bodie agree to move a small part of their business to Hamsterdam to test the waters. Avon orders Slim Charles to attack Marlo using Cutty and other muscle. Bell is told that construction at the site is being held up by city hall. When he meets with Davis, the senator demands $25,000 to move things ahead. Cutty and Slim Charles devise a plan of attack and explain it to their crew. However, the plan goes awry when the getaway driver, Chipper, makes his move too early and allows himself and Country to get killed by Marlo's crew. Cutty, Slim Charles, and Gerard manage to escape. When Avon and Bell disagree on their next move, Slim Charles and Cutty volunteer to handle things themselves. Marlo's advisor Vinson warns him to expect retribution from Avon. Marlo readies his soldiers Snoop and Partlow for the coming gang war. Brianna gives her blessing for Donette to pursue her relationship with Bell, but is startled by McNulty's allegation that D'Angelo's death was not a suicide. Cutty and Slim Charles come across Fruit's crew with their guard down. Cutty has a shot lined up on Fruit, but allows him to escape. When Avon expresses his disappointment, Cutty admits that he couldn't shoot Fruit because \\"the game\\" is no longer part of him and that he wants no further involvement. Avon, still respectful of Cutty, lets him go on good terms. Meanwhile, McNulty and Greggs mistakenly report to Daniels that Marlo is a new member of the Barksdales, erroneously concluding that Marlo's territory belongs to Bell. Despite the detectives' urging, Daniels rules that as long as Bell isn't openly violent, they have no call to investigate him. McNulty and Greggs meet with a state's attorney in Anne Arundel County to discuss reopening D'Angelo's case, but are told that another murder will not be put on the county's books without a suspect. The two go drinking and discuss their relationship difficulties. Bubbles tells Greggs about the botched gunfight and corrects her about the relationship between the Stanfield and Barksdale crews. She and McNulty report the new killings to Daniels, who chastises them for insubordination. Acting on a plan with Greggs, McNulty presents the case to Colvin, who sees that he is going behind Daniels' back. The next day, Colvin, Rawls and Burrell meet with Daniels to give him his new assignment. Production=Title reference The title refers to the return of Avon Barksdale and also the major case unit returning its focus to investigating the Barksdale organization. Additionally, the title may refer to Cutty's desire to leave the game, but his lack of experience or skills to do so. Epigraph Avon makes this statement to Stringer in reference to his own inability to adjust to the new legitimate aspects of their business, and an inability to escape the molds of the institution.

History  The first skating rink in Frankfurt opened during a patent exhibition in 1882 in the Palmengarten. It covered 520m¬≤ and operated for two months; the refrigeration system was designed by Linde,Linde AG: \\"75 Jahre Linde\\", 1954, S. 52 and it was probably the first skating rink where Ammonia was used as a refrigerant. Ten years later, a larger rink was permanently installed on the same site. The Eissporthalle was designed by Richard Heil and Werner Deyle, when it opened it was one of two buildings with ice skating rinks, the other was next to the Waldstadion which closed in the 1990s. Today it is the only ice skating rink in Frankfurt, although a few others exist in the metropolitan area.  Function  The exterior tent The arena complex includes four different skating areas, linked by a corridor of ice - the main arena, which is a standard size Ice Hockey rink, a smaller indoor room used for curling and Hockey training, and an outside area split into two - a large oval shaped track open to the public, with another Ice Hockey rink in the centre, rarely open to the public. There is also a large indoor bar and a small outdoor snack area. The price depends on what season it is, with an adult pass in the high season costing 7 Euro, and 5 in the low season. The large car park to the front of the building also serves as a major showground for events coming to the city, with the largest being the annual Dippemess funfair every April.

An electric aircraft is an aircraft powered by electric motors. Electricity may be supplied by a variety of methods including batteries, ground power cables, solar cells, ultracapacitors, fuel cells and power beaming. Small, electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s, with one unconfirmed report as early as 1957. They have since developed into small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones, which in the twenty-first century have become widely used for many purposes. Although manned flights in a tethered helicopter go back to 1917 and in airships to the previous century, the first manned free flight by an electrically powered aeroplane, the MB-E1, was not made until October 1973 and most manned electric aircraft today are still only experimental demonstrators. Between 2015 and 2016, Solar Impulse 2 completed a circumnavigation of the Earth using solar power. More recently, interest in electric passenger aircraft has grown, for both commercial airliners and personal air vehicles. Design All electric aircraft to date have been powered by electric motors driving thrust- generating propellers or lift-generating rotors. Some of the propeller-driven types have been airships. Mechanisms for storing and supplying the necessary electricity vary considerably, and each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Mechanisms used include: *Batteries can retain a significant electrical charge, although their weight still limits the range achievable. *Power cables connect to a ground-based supply. *Solar cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. *Ultracapacitors can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use *Fuel cells are similar to batteries but draw their reactants from an external source. *Microwave energy has been beamed from a ground-based source. Batteries Batteries are the most common energy carrier component of electric aircraft, due to their relatively high capacity. Batteries were the earliest source of electricity, first powering airships in the nineteenth century. These early batteries were very heavy and it was not until the arrival of technologies such as nickel-cadmium (NiCd) rechargeable types in the second half of the twentieth century, that batteries became a practical power source for aircraft. Modern battery types include lithium-based and a number of other less widely used technologies. Such batteries remain a popular power source today, although they still have limited endurance between charges and hence limited range. Batteries are also often used for the temporary storage of electricity generated by another source. Power cables An electrical power cable may be connected to a ground-based supply, such as an electric generator. At low altitudes this can avoid carrying heavy batteries and was used by the experimental Petr√≥czy- K√°rm√°n-≈Ωurovec PKZ-1 observation helicopter of 1917. However such a craft must remain tethered to a ground facility, and the higher and or farther it flies, the heavier the weight of cable it must lift with it. Solar cells A solar cell converts sunlight directly into electricity, either for direct power or temporary storage. The power output of solar cells is small, even when many are connected together, which limits their use and is also expensive. However their use of freely available sunlight makes them attractive for high-altitude, long-endurance applications. For endurance flights, keeping the craft in the air all night typically requires a backup storage system, which supplies power during the hours of darkness and recharges during the day. Ultracapacitors An ultracapacitor can store a limited amount of energy for short bursts of high-power use, such as when taking off, but due to its relatively small storage ability it is not suitable as a primary power source. Its advantage over a small battery is the ability to charge and discharge much faster with higher peak currents. Fuel cells A fuel cell uses the reaction between two fluids such as hydrogen and oxygen to create electricity. Unlike a battery, the fluids are not stored in the battery but are drawn in from outside. This offers the prospect of much greater range than batteries and experimental examples have flown, but the technology has yet to reach production. Microwaves Power beaming of electromagnetic energy such as microwaves, like a power cable, requires a ground-based power source. However, compared to a power cable, power beaming carries much less weight penalty as altitude increases. The technology has been demonstrated on small models but awaits practical development. History=Pioneers The use of electricity for aircraft propulsion was first experimented with during the development of the airship which took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. On 8 October 1883, Gaston Tissandier flew the first electrically-powered airship. The following year, Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs flew La France with a more powerful motor. Even with the lifting capacity of an airship, the heavy accumulators needed to store the electricity severely limited the speed and range of such early airships. For a tethered device such as an air observation platform, it is possible to run the power up the tether. In an attempt to create a more practical solution than the clumsy balloons then in use, the Austro-Hungarian Petr√≥czy-K√°rm√°n-≈Ωurovec PKZ-1 electric-powered helicopter was flown in 1917. It had a specially-designed continuous-rated electric motor made by Austro- Daimler and received its power up a cable from a ground-based DC generator. However electric motors were not yet powerful enough for such applications and the motor burned out after only a few flights. In 1909, an electric free flight model was claimed to have been flown eight minutes, but this claim was disputed by the builder of the first recorded electric Radio-Controlled model aircraft flight in 1957. Power density for electric flight is problematic even for small models. In 1964, William C. Brown at Raytheon flew a model helicopter that received all of the power needed for flight by microwave power transmission. First prototypes Success in a full-sized aeroplane would not be achieved until Nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries were developed, having a much higher storage-to-weight ratio than older technologies. In 1973, Fred Militky and Heino Brditschka converted a Brditschka HB-3 motor glider to an electric aircraft, the Militky MB-E1. On 21 October, it flew for just 14 minutes to become the first electric aircraft to fly under its own power with a person on board. Developed almost in parallel with NiCad technology, solar cells were also slowly becoming a practicable power source. Following a successful model test in 1974, the world‚Äôs first official flight in a solar- powered, person-carrying aircraft took place on April 29, 1979. The Mauro Solar Riser used photovoltaic cells to deliver 350 watts at 30 volts. These charged a small battery, which in turn powered the motor. The battery alone was capable of powering the motor for 3 to 5 minutes, following a 1.5-hour charge, enabling it to reach a gliding altitude. Under the direction of Freddie To, an architect and member of the Kremer prize committee, the Solar One was designed by David Williams and produced by Solar-Powered Aircraft Developments. A motor-glider type aircraft originally built as a pedal-powered airplane to attempt the Channel crossing, the airplane proved too heavy to be successfully powered by human power and was then converted to solar power, using an electric motor driven by batteries that were charged before flight by a solar cell array on the wing. The maiden flight of Solar One took place at Lasham Airfield, Hampshire, on June 13, 1979. Following successful human- powered flight, a relaunched Kremer prize allowed the crew to store energy before takeoff. In the 1980s several such designs stored electricity generated by pedalling, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Monarch and the Aerovironment Bionic Bat.Bionic Bat ‚Äì Stored energy human powered aircraft M.

It employed 2499 wing-mounted solar cells. The German solar-powered aircraft \\"Icar√© II\\" was designed and built by the institute of aircraft design (Institut f√ºr Flugzeugbau) of the University of Stuttgart in 1996. The leader of the project and often pilot of the aircraft is Rudolf Voit-Nitschmann the head of the institute. The design won the Berblinger prize in 1996, the EAA Special Achievement Award in Oshkosh, the Golden Daidalos Medal of the German Aeroclub and the OSTIV-Prize in France in 1997. Unmanned aerial vehicles The NASA Pathfinder Plus electric-powered unmanned aerial vehicle NASA's Pathfinder, Pathfinder Plus, Centurion, and Helios were a series of solar and fuel cell system‚Äìpowered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) developed by AeroVironment, Inc. from 1983 until 2003 under NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology program. On September 11, 1995, Pathfinder set an unofficial altitude record for solar- powered aircraft of during a 12-hour flight from NASA Dryden. After further modifications, the aircraft was moved to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. On July 7, 1997, Pathfinder raised the altitude record for solar‚Äìpowered aircraft to , which was also the record for propeller‚Äìdriven aircraft. On August 6, 1998, Pathfinder Plus raised the national altitude record to for solar-powered and propeller-driven aircraft. On August 14, 2001 Helios set an altitude record of ‚Äì the record for FAI class U (experimental/new technologies), and FAI class U-1.d (remotely controlled UAV: mass 500 kg to less than 2,500 kg) as well as the altitude record for propeller‚Äìdriven aircraft. On June 26, 2003, the Helios prototype broke up and fell into the Pacific Ocean off Hawaii after the aircraft encountered turbulence, ending the program. The QinetiQ Zephyr is a lightweight solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). As of 23 July 2010 it holds the endurance record for an unmanned aerial vehicle of over 2 weeks (336 hours). It is of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer construction, the 2010 version weighing (the 2008 version weighed ) with a span of 22.5 metres (the 2008 version had ). During the day it uses sunlight to charge lithium-sulphur batteries, which power the aircraft at night. In July 2010 a Zephyr made a world record UAV endurance flight of 336 hours, 22 minutes and 8 seconds (more than two weeks) and also set an altitude record of for FAI class U-1.c (remotely controlled UAV: weight 50 kg to less than 500 kg). Light aircraft The first commercially available, non-certified production electric aircraft, the Alisport Silent Club self-launching glider plane, flew in 1997. It is optionally driven by a DC electric motor running on of batteries that store 1.4 kWh of energy. The first certificate of airworthiness for an electric powered aircraft was granted to the Lange Antares 20E in 2003. Also an electric, self-launching 20-meter glider/sailplane, with a 42-kilowatt DC/DC brushless motor and lithium-ion batteries, it can climb up to 3,000 meters with fully charged cells.06.09.2011: SWR.de The Research Aircraft Antares DLR H2 and Antares H3 The first flight was in 2003. In 2011 the aircraft won the 2011 Berblinger competition. In 2005, Alan Cocconi of AC Propulsion flew, with the assistance of several other pilots, an unmanned airplane named \\"SoLong\\" for 48 hours non-stop, propelled entirely by solar energy. This was the first such around-the-clock flight, on energy stored in the batteries mounted on the plane.Solar Plane Breaks Two-Night Flight Barrier Renewable Energy World, July 5, 2005 In 2008, The Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator In 2007, the non-profit CAFE Foundation held the first Electric Aircraft Symposium in San Francisco. The Boeing-led FCD (fuel cell demonstrator) project uses a Diamond HK-36 Super Dimona motor glider as a research test bed for a hydrogen fuel cell powered light airplane. Successful flights took place in February and March 2008. The first the NASA Green Flight Challenge took place in 2011 and was won by a Pipistrel Taurus G4 on 3 October 2011. In 2013 Chip Yates demonstrated that the world's fastest electric plane, a Long ESA, a modified Rutan Long-EZ, could outperform a gasoline-powered Cessna and other aircraft in a series of trials verified by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale. The Long ESA was found to be less expensive, have a higher maximum speed, and higher rate of climb, partly due to the ability of the aircraft to maintain performance at altitude as no combustion takes place. In 2017, Siemens used a modified Extra EA-300 acrobatic airplane, the 330LE, to set two new records: on March 23 at the Dinslaken Schwarze Heide airfield in Germany, the aircraft reached a top speed of around over three kilometers; the next day, it became the first glider towing electric aircraft. Solar Impulse circumnavigation Solar Impulse 2 is powered by four electric motors. Energy from solar cells on the wings and horizontal stabilizer is stored in lithium polymer batteries and used to drive propellers. In 2012 the first Solar Impulse made the first intercontinental flight by a solar plane, flying from Madrid, Spain to Rabat, Morocco. Completed in 2014, Solar Impulse 2 carried more solar cells and more powerful engines, among other improvements. In March 2015, the plane took off on the first stage of a planned round-the-world trip, flying eastwards from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Due to battery damage, the craft halted at Hawaii, where its batteries were replaced. It resumed the circumnavigation in April 2016Amos, Jonathan. \\"Solar Impulse grounded until 2016\\", BBC News, 15 July 2015 and reached Seville, Spain, in June 2016. The following month it returned to Abu Dhabi, completing its circumnavigation of the world.  Developments  NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed NASA developed the X-57 Maxwell from a Tecnam P2006T The NASA Puffin was a concept, proposed in 2010, for an electric-powered, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), personal air vehicle.NASA's Puffin Is a Stealthy, Personal Tilt-Rotor Aircraft, Clay Dillow, Popular Science, 2010-01-19. The European Commission has financed many low TRL projects for innovative electric or hybrid propulsion aircraft. The ENFICA-FC is a project of the European Commission, to study and demonstrate an all-electric aircraft with fuel-cells as the main or auxiliary power system. During the three-year project, a fuel-cell based power system was designed and flown in a Rapid 200FC ultralight aircraft. The NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) is a NASA reconfigurable testbed in Plum Brook Station, Ohio, used to design, develop, assemble and test electric aircraft power systems, from a small, one or two person aircraft up to airliners. NASA research agreements (NRA) are granted to develop electric-propulsion components. They will be completed in 2019 and the internal NASA work by 2020, then they will be assembled in a megawatt-scale drive system to be tested in the narrowbody-sized NEAT. NASA developed the X-57 Maxwell to demonstrate technology to reduce fuel use, emissions, and noise. Modified from a Tecnam P2006T, the X-57 will have 14 electric motors driving propellers mounted on the wing leading edges. In July 2017, Scaled Composites is modifying a first P2006T by replacing the piston engines with electric motors, to fly early in 2018, then will move the motors to the wingtips to increase propulsive efficiency and finally will instal of the high aspect ratio wing with 12 smaller props. In September 2017, UK budget carrier EasyJet announced it was developing an electric 180-seater for 2027 with Wright Electric. Founded in 2016, US Wright Electric built a two-seat proof- of-concept with 272 kg (600 lb) of batteries, and believes they can be scaled up with substantially lighter new battery chemistries: a 291 nm (540 km) range would suffice for 20% of Easyjet passengers. Wright Electric will then develop a 10-seater, eventually an at least 120 passengers single aisle, short haul airliner and targets 50% lower noise and 10% lower costs. Jeffrey Engler, CEO of Wright Electric, estimates that commercially viable electric planes will lead to around a 30% reduction in energy costs. On March 19, 2018, Israel Aerospace Industries announced it plans to develop a short-haul electric airliner, building on its small UAS electric power systems experience. It could develop it in-house, or with a startup like Israeli Eviation, U.S. Zunum Aero or Wright Electric. Australia-based MagniX intends to fly an electric Cessna 208 Caravan with a motor for up to an hour, by August 2019. The company's Magni5 electric motor already produces continuously peak at 2,500 rpm at 95% efficiency with a 53 kg (117 lb.) dry mass, a 5 kW/kg power density, competing with the , Siemens SP260D for the Extra 330LE. By September 2018, a electric motor with a propeller had been tested on a Cessna iron bird. The Caravan was expected to fly by the fall of 2019 and by 2022 MagniX estimates electric aircraft will fly up to by 2024. The motor ran on a test dynamometer for 1,000 hours. The iron bird is a Caravan forward fuselage used as a test bed, with the usual PT6 turboprop engine replaced by an electric motor, inverter and a liquid-cooling system, including radiators, driving a Cessna 206 propeller. The production motor will produce at 1,900 rpm, down from the test motor's 2,500 rpm, allowing the installation of the propeller without a reduction gearbox. A 560-kW (750-hp) MagniX electric motor was installed in a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver seaplane. Harbour Air, based in British Columbia, hopes to introduce the aircraft in commercial service in 2021, for trips under 30 minutes initially, until range increases with battery technology. On December 10, 2019, it made its first flight of four minutes duration, from the Fraser River near Vancouver. The normally-fitted Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior piston engine of the six-passenger Beaver was replaced by a 135 kg (297 lb) magni500, with swappable batteries, allowing 30 minute flights plus 30 minutes of reserve power. On 28 May 2020, an electric- powered Cessna 208B eCaravan, became the largest commercial aircraft to fly on electric power. By May 2019, Roland Berger counted almost 170 electric aircraft programmes in development, anticipating over 200 by the year end, with a majority of them aimed at the urban air taxi role. US/UK startup ZeroAvia develops zero-emissions fuel-cell propulsion systems for small aircraft, and tests its HyFlyer in Orkney supported by ¬£2.7 million from the UK government. A demonstrator for the German Scylax E10 10-seater should fly in 2022, it should be used by FLN Frisia Luftverkehr to connect East Frisian islands with its range and 300 m (980 ft) short takeoff and landing distance. The Velis Electro, an externally similar variant of the pictured Pipistrel Virus, was the first type certificated electric aircraft on 10 June 2020. On 10 June 2020, the Velis Electro variant of the two-seat Pipistrel Virus was the first electric aircraft to secure type certification, from the EASA. Powered by a 76 hp (58 kW) electric engine developed with Emrax, it offers a payload of 170 kg, a cruise speed of 90 kn (170 km/h), and a 50 min endurance. Pipistrel plans to deliver over 30 examples in 2020, to be operated as a trainer aircraft. Elon Musk revised his previous prediction of 2019 about the batteries of the commercial electric planes from 5 years to 3 years. Recently, Tesla released the research papers based on extensively improved next- generation battery cells, claiming that they will achieve batteries of 400Wh/kg energy, which is required for a commercial electric planes to fly. On 23 September 2020, Gothenburg-based Heart Aerospace presented its ES-19 design, a 19-seat all-electric commercial aircraft planned to fly by mid-2026. With a conventional aluminium airframe and wing, its planned range is 222 nmi (400 km) and planned minimum runway length is 800 m (2,640 ft). Initially targeting airlines operating in the Nordic countries, Heart has received \\"expressions of interest\\" for 147 ES-19 aircraft worth about ‚Ç¨1.1 billion or US$1.3 billion (‚Ç¨ million or $ million each) from at least eight airlines. Backed by Swedish venture capitalist EQT Ventures, Nordic governments and the European Union, Heart was initially funded by the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova and is an alumnus of Silicon Valley start-up accelerator Y Combinator.  Hybrid power  A hybrid electric aircraft is an aircraft with a hybrid electric powertrain, needed for airliners as the energy density of lithium-ion batteries is much lower than aviation fuel. By May 2018, there were over 30 projects, and short-haul hybrid-electric airliners were envisioned from 2032. The most advanced are the Zunum Aero 10-seater, the Airbus E-Fan X demonstrator, the VoltAero Cassio, UTC is modifying a Bombardier Dash 8, while an Ampaire prototype first flew on 6 June 2019.  Ion wind In November 2018, MIT engineers flew the first plane with no moving parts, propelled by ion wind thrust. Applications Currently, battery-powered electric aircraft have much more limited payload, range and endurance than those powered by internal combustion engines. It is hence only suitable for small aircraft (for large passenger aircraft, an improvement of the energy density by a factor 20 compared to li-ion batteries would be required). However, pilot training is an area that emphasises short flights. Several companies make, or have demonstrated, light aircraft suitable for initial flight training. The Airbus E-Fan was aimed at flight training but the project was cancelled. Pipistrel makes light sport electric aircraft such as the Pipistrel WATTsUP, A prototype of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro. The advantage of electric aircraft for flight training is the lower cost of electrical energy compared to aviation fuel. Noise and exhaust emissions are also reduced compared with combustion engines. An increasingly common application is as a sustaining engine or even a self- launching engine for gliders. The most common system is the front electric sustainer used in over 240 gliders. The limited range is not such a problem as the engine is used for a short period either to launch or to avoid an outlanding. The advantage of an electric engine in this case comes from the certainty that it will start, and the rapidity of deployment, compared with two-stroke gasoine engines or jet engines. Electric rotorcraft Although the Austro-Hungarian Petr√≥czy-K√°rm√°n-≈Ωurovec team flew an experimental tethered military observation helicopter in 1917, the use of electric power for rotor-borne flight was not exploited until modern times. Unmanned Lightweight components have enabled the development, for recreational purposes among others, of small, cheap radio-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles, often called drones, notably the widespread quadcopter. Manned Solution F/Chretien helicopter The Solution F/Chretien Helicopter the world's first man-carrying, free-flying electric helicopter was developed by Pascal Chretien. The concept was taken from the conceptual computer-aided design model on September 10, 2010 to the first testing at 30% power on March 1, 2011‚Äîless than six months. The aircraft first flew August 4 to 12, 2011. All development was conducted in Venelles, France. In February 2016, Philippe Antoine, AQUINEA and ENAC, Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de l'Aviation Civile, successfully flew the first full electric conventional helicopter called Volta in Castelnaudary Airfield, France. Volta demonstrated a 15-minute hovering flight in December 2016. The helicopter is powered by two PMSM motors delivering together 80 kW and a 22kWh Lithium battery. Volta is officially registered by DGAC, the French Airworthiness Authority, and is authorized for flying in the French civilian airspace. In September 2016, Martine Rothblatt and Tier1 Engineering successfully tested an electric-powered helicopter. The five minute flight reached an altitude of 400 feet with a peak speed of 80 knots. The Robinson R44 helicopter was modified with two three-phase permanent magnet synchronous YASA Motors, weighing 100 lb, plus 11 Lithium polymer batteries from Brammo weighing 1100 lb and a digital cockpit display. It later flew for 20 minutes in 2016. On December 7, 2018, Tier 1 Engineering flew an electric, battery-powered R44 over at and an altitude of , setting a Guinness World Record for the farthest distance. Projects The Sikorsky Firefly S-300 was a project to flight test an electric rotorcraft, but the project was put on hold due to battery limitations. The world's first large-scale all- electric tilt-rotor was the AgustaWestland Project Zero unmanned aerial vehicle technology demonstrator, which performed unmanned tethered fights on ground power in June 2011, less than six months after the company gave the official go-ahead. The Airbus CityAirbus is an electrically-powered VTOL aircraft demonstrator. The multirotor aircraft is intended to carry four passengers, with a pilot initially and to become self-piloted when regulations allow. Its first unmanned flight is scheduled for the end of 2018 with manned flights following in 2019. Type certification and commercial introduction are planned for 2023.

It involved isolating children, sometimes for weeks on end, and in some cases drove children to the verge of suicide. Following expressions of concern, the council ordered a public inquiry into the practice of \\"Pindown\\". The subsequent report condemned the practice as \\"unethical, unprofessional and illegal\\"; the report had a major impact on children's law in the United Kingdom. Background Staffordshire children's homes were, in the 1980s, an underfunded and understaffed part of a department that was required to find ¬£1.5M in cuts.Levy 1991:14 They were also severely overcrowded; the log books of The Birches notes that on one occasion, 30 children were playing five-a-side football whilst that of 245 Hartshill Road records an instance of 20 children playing the game; in each case, the maximum number of residents in each home was exactly half those recorded - 15 at The Birches and 10 at Hartshill Road. It was also noted that a boy who absconded from The Birches returned to find there was no bed for him; he spent the night on the floor.Levy & Kahan 1991:23 On 2 October 1989 John Spurr, a deputy director of Staffordshire County Council's social services department, was telephoned by a Stoke-on-Trent solicitor, Kevin Williams, who was extremely concerned about a 15yearold girl for whom he was acting in care proceedings.Levy & Kahan 1991:2 She had made allegations of abuse in the children's home at 245 Hartshill Road and had broken her ankle in seeking to escape from the home. The following day, Barry O'Neill (Director of Social Services) issued instructions that pindown must cease at Hartshill Road. When the issue was publicised, the county council determined that a public inquiry must be held. O'Neill later noted that, in such a straitened system, there had been \\"a clear policy decision to let [Tony Lathamthe social worker in charge] get on with it and not to interfere as long as he 'produced the goods'.\\"Levy & Kahan 1991:15 The practice Pindown was a behaviour management policy developed by social worker Tony Latham in the 1980s. It began as a strict control regime; children were often required to wear pyjamas in order to prevent their absconding, but this practice encountered little success; the local police complained that they were still spending too much time dealing with runaways.Levy & Kahan 1991:25 Pindown was first practised in the children's residential home at 245 Hartshill Road, Stoke-on-Trent, but later spread to other such homes in the county. Children were regularly deprived of their clothing and footwear, being required to wear either pyjamas or just their underwear.Levy & Kahan 1991:26 They were locked in rooms called \\"pindown rooms\\", sometimes for periods of weeks or months, similar to a lockdown in prisons. The children were kept in solitary confinement with little furniture (and sometimes no bedding),Levy & Kahan 1991:27 no conversation and repetitive occupations. On occasion, they were required to perform physical exercise outdoors in their underwear and were subjected to corporal punishment; sometimes they were also deprived of food, water or lavatory paper, not allowed to go to the lavatory at all,Levy & Kahan 1991:40 or were doused in cold water.Levy & Kahan 1991:43 Log books for the institutions simply recorded such treatment as \\"loss of privileges\\". The Pindown schedule included \\"Rise and bath\\" at 0700hrs then \\"Bed and lights out\\" at 1900hrs (after another bath at 1800hrs).Levy & Kahan 1991:209 An internal document from one home notes (in block capitals) that, amongst other rules:Levy & Kahan 1991:230 > Between 1983 and 1989, at least 132 children, aged nine and upwards, > experienced what came to be called pindown.

It combines authentic archival newsreel footage of Harlem in the 1920s with scripted scenes to produce a non-linear impressionistic storyline celebrating black gay identity and desire during the artistic and cultural period known as the Harlem Renaissance in New York. The film has a runtime of about 42 minutes. Critical synopsis Opening the film is a voice-over of the original radio broadcast made in tribute to Langston Hughes upon his death in 1967 as the scene of his funeral is recreated and reinterpreted. Interspersed among such images as shifting time periods that seamlessly flow from past to present, black men dancing together within a revisionist version of the Cotton Club, or a speakeasy, and dream sequences, are brief narrative extracts from the poetic works of Hughes alongside those of Richard Bruce Nugent, James Baldwin, and Essex Hemphill. Also shown are the controversial images of black men by the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. The film is not a biography of Langston Hughes. It is a memoriam to Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance as reconstructed from a black gay perspective.Dolan Hubbard (2004), \\"Langston Hughes: A Bibliographic Essay\\", in S. Tracy (2004), A Historical Guild to Langston Hughes, pp. 216-217, Oxford University Press. Moreover, it purports to be a meditation on the black gay experience within a historical context built around the homophobia, oppression and denial faced by men of African descent within black communities alongside \\"allusions and political commentary on white racism.\\"Russo, Vito (1990), \\"Who Owns the Past?\\", The Advocate magazine, p. 56. Hughes is presented as an icon and cultural metaphor for black gay men who were confronted with being ostracized if they did not conform to black bourgeoisie standards whose overriding goal concerned fuller social integration. Contested are the ways the black male and his sexuality have been represented in the modern Western world and how existing notions of race and gender figure within American and African-American culture.Hubbard (2004), pp. 216-217. Throughout this process, the identity of Hughes as a black gay man is reclaimed and no longer denied, a process paralleled in the ever-growing academic studies of Hughes today.\\"Referring to men of African descent, biographer Arnold Rampersad writes: \\"...Hughes found some young men, especially dark-skinned men, appealing and sexually fascinating. (Both in his various artistic representations, in fiction especially, and in his life, he appears to have found young white men of little sexual appeal.) Virile young men of very dark complexion fascinated him. Rampersad, vol. 2, 1988, p. 336.Sandra West explicitly states Hughes' \\"apparent love for black men as evidenced through a series of unpublished poems he wrote to a black male lover named 'Beauty'.\\" West, 2003, p. 162. Moreover, adding to the historic and cinematic importance of the film in gay cinema, Looking for Langston was and continues to be one of very few films showing intra-racial affection between black gay men as revealed in the love story between the two leading black protagonists, Ben Ellison as Langston Hughes and Matthew Baidoo as Beauty.In one key scene, there is \\"an exchange of looks between 'Langston' and his mythic object of desire, a black man named 'Beauty'...\\" Mercer, Kobena (1994), Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural Studies.Julien, Isaac, and Colin MacCabe (1991). Diary of a Young Soul Rebel, pp. 128-129. British Film Institute. Upon the first release of Looking for Langston in the United States in 1990, the estate of Langston Hughes initially attempted to have the film censored because of copyright violations: permission allegedly had not been obtained by the filmmakers permitting them to use the poetry of Hughes in the film. During subsequent screenings of Looking for Langston, the sound was repeatedly turned down when the work of Hughes was read. Despite allegations of censorship from critics at the time of the U.S. premier of the film, the estate had allowed many of Hughes' poems to appear in gay anthologies in the print media and continues to do so until this day. Today it falls under the auspices of the British Film Institute as part of its national \\"Black World\\" initiative celebrating black creativity in film.

It is found in open forest, woodland and forest- savanna mosaics in Sub-Saharan Africa. Description It has a total length of approximately 50 cm (20 in) and weighs .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The plumage is overall blackish with dense white spots. It has a distinctive black crest on the top of its head, the form of which varies from small curly feathers to down depending upon subspecies, and which easily separates it from all other species of guineafowl, except the plumed guineafowl. The names \\"crested\\" and \\"plumed\\" are often misapplied across the species. Breeding The species is monogamous with probable strong and long-lasting pair bonds. Courtship feeding is common, the author having seen a captive male run 5‚Äì10 metres to the hen to present some particular morsel. The nest is a well-hidden scrape in long grass or under a bush; eggs vary from nearly white to buff and a clutch is usually around 4 or 5. Intraspecific taxonomy The intraspecific taxonomy of the crested guineafowl has been subject to considerable debate, but most recent authorities accept 5 subspecies (e.g. I. Martinez in HBW, 1994). Visual differences between the subspecies, in addition to the form of the crest, are in the colour and position of any patches on the otherwise grey-blue neck and face. Such patches vary from almost white to yellow, to red. The nominate subspecies is found in East Africa from Somalia to Tanzania, and is distinctive with a grey-blue neck and extensive red to the face. It was formerly considered a monotypic species,HBW, 1994 the Kenya crested guineafowl, in which case the remaining subspecies, which are found in southern, central and west Africa, retain the common name crested guineafowl, but under the scientific name Guttera edouardi. They have a bluish face and neck, though the nape is very pale greyish (almost white) in some subspecies and the throat is red in others.

However, its best placement was 4th in the 1976-77 and the 1977-78 season. It played in the 1. SNHL consecutively until 1989. Slovak era After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the club was included in the Slovak 1.Liga. It was at this point renamed to HK 36. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, the squad was promoted to the Slovak Extraliga. In its first season, Skalica placed 6th in the regular season and was beaten by ≈†KP Poprad in the quarterfinals. In the 1998‚Äì99 season, the club placed 3rd in the regular season, defeating ≈†KP Poprad in the quarterfinals but losing to HC Ko≈°ice in the semifinals. Skalica won bronze medals because second defeated semifinalist HKm Zvolen had worse placement after the regular season. The following seasons were less successful for the club, as it did not reach the semifinals for nine years. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, the squad defeated HKm Zvolen in the quarterfinals but it was in turn beaten by HC Ko≈°ice in the semifinals. Skalica won bronze medals for a second time because it had managed a better placement after the regular season than Dukla Trenƒç√≠n. The club's greatest success came during the 2008‚Äì09 season, when Skalica placed 3rd in the regular season. In the quarterfinals, it won the series 4‚Äì0 against Dukla Trenƒç√≠n. The club later defeated HC Slovan Bratislava 4‚Äì3 in the semifinals, but lost 4‚Äì2 to HC Ko≈°ice in the finals. ≈Ωigmund P√°lffy was the scoring leader in the regular season (99 Pts) and in the playoffs (27 Pts). Juraj Mik√∫≈° also had a great season and was the second-highest scorer (90 Pts) in the Extraliga after P√°lffy. HK 36 was forced to leave the Extraliga in 2016 due to lack of funds. The team left prior to their 47th round contest vs. MHC Mountfield due to lack of funds and the exodus of players before the end of the transfer window.

Part of the Commando Helicopter Force, it is a specialist amphibious unit operating the AgustaWestland Commando Merlin HC4 helicopter and provides troop transport and load lifting support to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. In 2012, the squadron celebrated 50 years since it was awarded \\"commando\\" status. The squadron is based at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset. Role The primary role of the squadron is to support the Royal Marines in amphibious assaults and wartime environments. It conducts medium-lift frontline operations in a variety of environments including desert, arctic, jungle and maritime. The squadron mainly conducts troop carrying and load-lifting missions, but can also perform CASEVAC, and CSAR duties. They are the spearhead of the Commando Helicopter Force, held at high-readiness, and are a key part of the Royal Navy's expeditionary wartime capability. History=Beginnings Avenger taking off from 845 NAS formed on 1 January 1943 as a Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron (TBRS) flying the new Grumman Avenger, designed as a much needed replacement for the ageing Fairey Swordfish. The squadron took part in its first active service by dive bombing an oil refinery at Surabaya, Java, in May 1944. For the following year, the squadron saw action over Malaya, Ceylon, and Sumatra before being disbanded in 1945. 845 reformed on 15 March 1955 at Gosport to be an Anti Submarine unit flying the newly proved Westland Whirlwind HAS.22's, with which it saw service on several ships in the Mediterranean and Indonesia. Its job was to prove the new sonar technology and the navigational reliability of the Whirlwind. After returning to the UK, the squadron was disbanded briefly in October before being reformed on 14 November 1955. In April 1956, the squadron deployed on and to partake in the fleet review and various training exercises. Much training was conducted with the Royal Marines in the vicinity of Malta and put them in great stead for the approaching Suez Crisis. Although politically a failure, militarily, and particularly for the Navy, the Suez episode was a huge success. 845 NAS were involved in landing 515 Marines and 89 tons of equipment in history's 'first vertical assault'. Several aircraft were damaged from small arms fire, with one ditching on the way back to HMS Theseus. Thankfully, all survived. The lessons of the Suez Crisis were not lost on the Government, which set about establishing amphibious forces capable of rapid deployment and response. The backbone of these forces would be helicopters operating from large ships designed for amphibious warfare. Having re-equipped with Whirlwind HAS.7's, the squadron joined for a commission in the Middle and Far East in late 1957. During this time, the squadron was involved in various exercises and troop moves as a result of the deteriorating situation in Aden. Shortly after this, the squadron was heavily involved in a salvage operation when two ships collided and caught fire in the Persian Gulf. A fire party was boarded and the wounded evacuated in 845 NAS helicopters. For its part in this long and difficult operation, the squadron was awarded the Boyd Trophy for the Navy's most outstanding piece of aviation in the year. During the 1950s, 845 NAS was the only squadron to operate as a front line ASW unit and was responsible for developing most of the doctrine used by today's ASW squadrons. After disbanding yet again in mid-1959, the squadron was reformed on 10 April 1962 as a Commando Helicopter Squadron with Westland Wessex HAS.1's. It was the first commando squadron to have these helicopters. While embarked aboard later that year, the ship was ordered to make best speed for Singapore to help quell the rebellion in Brunei and the subsequent Indonesian inspired insurrection. Troops were landed in Borneo and the squadron was immediately committed to supporting British Forces ashore. They alone facilitated troops in being able to patrol vast areas of the jungle while operating from the most basic of clearings. In 1964, the squadron won the Boyd Trophy for a second time as a result of this operation, and the nickname 'Junglies' was born. After being relieved in 1965 by 848 Squadron, 845 returned to Culdrose to re-equip with the new twin-turbine Wessex HU.5, B Flight of 845 returned to Borneo in June 1966 and were the last Junglies. HMS Bulwark embarked B Flight in October 1966 in Labuan. After a few quiet years involving exercises all round the globe and the inclusion of Lieutenant The Prince of Wales in Red Dragon flight, the Ministry of Defence announced that a permanent presence was to be established in Northern Ireland, which resulted in a six weeks rolling roulement for all commando aircrew. 845 NAS established a hard earned reputation for trying its utmost to help the troops in all weathers. Its aircraft were some of the first to render help to the mortar devastated Forkhill Special Forces base. In one month alone the Squadron flew 80% of all support helicopter task hours with just one third of the available assets. In November 1971 the squadron prepared to abandon ship and evacuate HMS Bulwark when a serious boiler room fire broke out while off the coast of (then) Jugoslavia. An area of flight deck aft from the rear hangar lift was all that could be used for flying because the crew were mustered for Emergency Stations on the flight deck. Plans for how to launch 21 aircraft from three spots in quick succession were rapidly made. The fire was brought under control and the squadron was stood down. One Marine Engineering Mechanic died in the fire. In January 1972 845 embarked on HMS Bulwark for Operation Exit, the withdrawal from Malta. Bulwark lay in Grand Harbour for 11 weeks and flew more than 1,000 missions. HRH Charles, Prince of Wales served in the squadron in the 1970s.Prince of Wales biography An 845 NAS Wessex HU.5 (background) and RAF Puma (foreground) at Farnborough in September 1982 Falklands April 1982 brought the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, which resulted in all crews being recalled from Ireland on 4 May to be on 24 hours notice. Others had already departed to the South Atlantic with the rest of the task force. After initially being tasked with resupplying the convoy while passing the Ascension Islands, the squadron inserted SAS troops into South Georgia, which preceded its recapture. The squadron continued to assist ground troops during the war before the white flag was eventually raised over Port Stanley. 1990s Sea King HC4 of 845 NAS over Northern Norway in 2014 After the Falklands War, 845 NAS caught up with its sister squadron 846 in being equipped with the Sea King HC4 helicopter. Since then, 845 NAS has trained hard to be the UK's main contingency force capable of operating around the world. 1990 brought Operation Granby, which saw a force normally used to operating in Arctic conditions, deployed to the Arabian deserts of the Gulf. Consequently, the squadron was heavily involved in the First Gulf War, before returning to the UK and re-establishing a presence in Northern Ireland between 1992 and 2002. The 1990s also saw 845 NAS deploy on operations in Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars. It supported UNPROFOR and NATO peacekeeping missions in the country, providing transportation and evacuating refugees and casualties. The first British helicopter squadron into Bosnia, 845 NAS was also the last squadron to leave in 2005. 2000s Besides Bosnia, the squadron was also called to the initial deployment to Afghanistan after the 11 September attacks, on Operation Oracle. During the same period, 845 NAS also met commitments in Sierra Leone, and in 2003 took the first troops into Iraq during the assault on the Al-Faw Peninsula. Having left Iraq in 2007, the squadron then deployed to AfghanistanRoyal Navy ‚Äì Current Operations: Afghanistan where they have been operating in Helmand Province and primarily based at Camp Bastion. 2010s In October 2011, they returned from Afghanistan to their base in Somerset. Back in the UK, the squadron provides aviation support to infantry training, and takes part in numerous amphibious exercises, thereby ensuring that the UK is able to effectively operate in the littoral environment and so is prepared for any contingency. This was shown in 2011 during Operation Ellamy in and around Libya. 845 received its Merlin Helicopters from the former 28 (Army Cooperation) Squadron RAF in July 2015 and participated in Exercise Black Alligator from mid-August to early October 2015. In June 2019 the squadron embarked on RFA Argus for a deployment to the Baltic Sea as part of the UK Joint Expeditionary Force. The squadron practised amphibious landings alongside the Wildcats of 847 NAS as part of exercise Baltic Protector in the Baltic Sea. It is stated that it is one of the FAA squadrons for the Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime). Aircraft operated A Royal Navy Merlin HC3, similar to that operated by 845 NAS.

The brand itself represents a standardized technical certification program and online service for Windows games, bringing a measure of regulation to the PC game market in much the same way that console manufacturers regulate their platforms. The branding program was open to both first-party and third-party publishers. Games for Windows was promoted through convention kiosks and through other forums as early as 2005. The promotional push culminated in a deal with Ziff Davis Media to rename the Computer Gaming World magazine to Games for Windows: The Official Magazine. The first GFW issue was published for November 2006. In 2008, Ziff Davis announced that the magazine would cease to be published, though online content would still be updated and maintained. In 2013, Microsoft announced that Xbox PC Marketplace would cease operations, which would result in the discontinuation of the Games for Windows brand. In spite of this announcement, the company stated that content previously purchased could still be accessed via the Games for Windows ‚Äì Live client software. Certification Games certified by Microsoft feature a prominent \\"Games for Windows\\" logo border across the top of their packaging, in a manner similar to games developed for the Xbox 360. Software must meet certain requirements mandated by Microsoft in order to display the brand on its packaging. These requirements include: * An \\"Easy Install\\" option that installs the title on a PC in the fewest possible steps and mouse clicks * Compatibility with Xbox 360 peripherals * An \\"Only on Xbox 360 and Windows Vista\\" or \\"Only on Windows Vista\\" stamp for game packaging * Compatibility with the Games Explorer * Compatibility with x64 processors with proper installation and execution on 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7; games themselves can be 32-bit * Support for normal and widescreen resolutions, such as 4:3 aspect ratio (800 √ó 600, 1024 √ó 768), 16:9 aspect ratio (1280 √ó 720, 1920 √ó 1080), and 16:10 aspect ratio (1280 √ó 800, 1440 √ó 900, 1680 √ó 1050, 1920 √ó 1200) * Support for parental controls and family safety features * Support for launching from Windows Media Center Microsoft claimed that it had increased its sales of Games for Windows-branded games in stores that had been giving the games greater focus, and stated that it planned to increase marketing efforts for the brand. Features=Cross- platform compatibility Certain games certified under the Games for Windows brand, including Shadowrun, and UNO featured cross-platform compatibility, allowing gamers to play against each other across Xbox 360 consoles and traditional Windows Vista or Windows 7 PCs. Online play Starting with Halo 2 on May 31, 2007, certain Games for Windows titles have access to Microsoft's Live network for online play and other features, including voice chat, instant messaging and friends lists, accessed from an in-game menu called the \\"Guide\\". Users can log in with their Xbox Live gamertags to gain achievements and play games and chat across platforms with games that support cross-platform compatibility. Some features, including cross-platform multiplayer gaming and multiplayer achievements, initially required a subscription to the Xbox Live Gold. However, on July 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that all Games for Windows functionality would be free for existing and future members, and that early adopters of the technology would receive refunds for previously incurred charges. In addition, Microsoft launched a Games for Windows Live Marketplace, similar to the Xbox Live Marketplace, which allowed users to download or purchase content, such as game demos, add- ons, and gamer pics, with Microsoft Points; the publisher of a title would determine if an item required to be purchased. At the same time, Microsoft announced its intentions to make the Games for Windows - Live client software interface more friendly and to reduce the technical requirements for developers. Games Explorer Hold 'Em poker game, including performance and content ratings. The Games Explorer, included with all versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, is a special folder that showcases the games installed on a user's computer and their related information, essentially making it a games gallery. When a compatible game is installed, the operating system adds a shortcut of the game to the Games Explorer, and can optionally download additional information, such as game packaging and content rating information (e.g., ESRB, PEGI, ACB, CERO) through the developer's own game definition file or from information provided by the Internet, although this feature was discontinued since 2016. Windows Experience Index information is also displayed within the interface. The feature was removed entirely in Windows 10 v1803. Games Explorer supports custom commands for games and also includes shortcuts to configure various operating system components which may be pertinent to gamers, such as audio devices, display devices, firewall settings, and game controllers. In Windows Vista, Games Explorer allows developers to expose game metadata and thumbnails to the interface and Windows Search through a shell handler. The Games Explorer is fully compatible with the parental controls feature included in Windows Vista and Windows 7. Parental controls allows parents to include or preclude certain games from being played based on their content, rating, and/or title, and can also block games from being played altogether. Compatibility typically depends on the age or popularity of a game, with newer games having better compatibility. If a game is incompatible, a user can manually add a game by dragging and dropping it to the Games Explorer. Tray and Play Tray and Play is a technology developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista that allows users to insert a game disc into an optical disc drive and play the game while it installs itself in the background and streams off the disc with minimal or zero caching‚Äîin a manner similar to a game console. The first and only commercial game known to use this technology is the Windows version of Halo 2.

The club has won the Slovak league championship twice (2001, 2013) and the IIHF Continental Cup in 2005. The team is nicknamed Rytieri; it means Knights in English. History=Early history The club was founded on 18 March 1927 as ZTC Zvolen. However, they played their first official game in 1932 against Sl√°via Bansk√° Bystrica. They lost 0‚Äì18 in the first game and 1‚Äì20 in the second game against Sl√°via. Zvolen played their first home game on 14 February 1932. They lost 0‚Äì2 against Sl√°via. In the 1933‚Äì34 season they played for the first time in organized competition, the Championship of Stredoslovensk√° ≈æupa. In the next season they won their first official game against Sokol Kremnica. Hockey in Zvolen was even played during World War II. After WW II they had very successful years between 1947 and 1953. Then there was a decline. Czechoslovak era Renewal of hockey in Zvolen started in 1964, when the Lokomot√≠va Buƒçina Zvolen club was established. In 1970 they promoted to the 1. SNHL (1st. Slovak National Hockey League), second level of Czechoslovak hockey. They placed 6th in their first season at the 1. SNHL. In the 1971‚Äì72 season they finished 3rd and in the next season they won the 1. SNHL. The club's scoring leader was Jozef Golonka. Zvolen qualified for the preliminary round of the Czechoslovak Extraliga. There they lost 7 of 8 games and were not promoted to the Extraliga. Zvolen won the 1. SNHL again in the 1974‚Äì75 season. Zvolen forward J√°n Letko was the top scorer of the 1. SNHL (48 goals). However, they lost in the preliminary round against Ingstav Brno and were not promoted to the Extraliga.

SNHL came in the 1977‚Äì78 season, but in the preliminary round they lost a series 2‚Äì4 against TJ Gottwaldov. Thus Zvolen never played in the Czechoslovak Extraliga, the top level of Czechoslovak hockey. Slovak era Dynamo Moscow at the 2004‚Äì05 IIHF Continental Cup Zvolen was a member of the inaugural season of the Slovak Extraliga, but they finished last and were relegated to the Slovak 1.Liga. Zvolen won the 1996‚Äì97 Slovak 1.Liga season and promoted to the Extraliga after 3 years. In the 1997‚Äì98 season they placed fifth in the regular season and were eliminated by Dukla Trenƒç√≠n in the quarterfinals. In the next season they progressed to the semifinals, beating Trenƒç√≠n in the quarterfinals, but were defeated by Slovan Bratislava.

It participated in the competition to meet Specification F9/26, together with other aircraft manufacturers, that included nine different designs, of which five were built. The Hawfinch first flew in March 1927. The Bristol Bulldog and the Hawfinch were considered to be the best of the aircraft evaluated, and were selected for more detailed evaluation. The contract was finally awarded to the Bristol Bulldog, because of its slightly higher maximum speed as well as being easier to maintain.Crawford, Alex. Bristol Bulldog & Gloster Gauntlet. (Mushroom Model Magazine #6166). London: Mushroom Model Publications, 2005. After the completion of the competition, the prototype Hawfinch was used for experimental purposes, being tested with single-bay wings and with a twin-float undercarriage. Only one prototype was built. Description The Hawfinch was a two-bay biplane with staggered wings. The structure was the patented Hawker metal tube & \\"fishplate\\" system, with fabric covering. It was the first all-metal fighter to be built by Hawker. The powerplant was initially a Bristol Jupiter VI engine, but this was changed to a Jupiter VII (450 hp/336 kW) before the performance trials. The armament consisted of two Vickers machine guns synchronised to fire through the propeller.

It was equipped with 12 Grumman Avenger I torpedo bombers. Two months later the squadron embarked on the escort carrier and was transferred to the UK. Before being assigned to in January 1944, four Grumman Wildcat V fighters were added to 846 NAS. HMS Tracker was first assigned to convoys going to Gibraltar, then to Murmansk. On the latter voyage, aircraft from 846 NAS attacked eight German U-boats. HMS Tracker was damaged in June 1944 in a collision with the Canadian frigate HMCS Teme (K458) while forming part of the naval screen for the D-Day landings, and the squadron disembarked to RAF Limavady airfield, Northern Ireland, joining 15 Group RAF Coastal Command. A month later 846 NAS was assigned to , mainly laying mines off Norway until September 1944. In December a detachment was formed and transferred to for a few days.

On 4 May 1945, twelve Avenger and four Wildcat aircraft of the squadron took part in Operation Judgement, Kilbotn, the last air-raid of the war in Europe. The fighter flight was disbanded after the end of hostilities in Europe. 846 NAS was then assigned to the 4th Carrier Group and should deploy to the Far East aboard the fleet carrier . However, a change of plans led to the squadron becoming a trials unit. It was renumbered 751 NAS and was disbanded at Machrihanish, in September 1945. Borneo 846 NAS was reformed in 1962 as a Commando squadron equipped with the Westland Whirlwind HAS.7. It was deployed to Borneo aboard the commando carrier and flew in support of actions against guerrillas during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. British Army units gave 846 NAS the nickname 'Junglies' in Borneo, which the squadron has kept until today. A Wessex HU5 of 846 NAS, Norway, 1981. After returning for the Far East, 846 NAS was disbanded again, only to be reformed in 1968 at RNAS Culdrose. This time the squadron was equipped with the Westland Wessex HU.5. The squadron deployed aboard the dock-landing ship and conducted cold weather trials in Norway. In May 1972, the squadron was relocated to RNAS Yeovilton as the Wessex Headquarters and Trials Squadron. In February 1979 the squadron was deployed aboard the commando carrier . In December of the same year 846 NAS started to convert to the Westland Sea King HC.4. Falklands War In April 1982, 846 NAS embarked aboard the carrier as part of the Royal Navy task force in the Falklands War. During the war 846 NAS Sea King's flew over 2800 hours, completed 10,000 individual troop moves and transported more than 81,600 t of freight. In 1983, detachments were deployed aboard the carriers HMS Hermes and .

The squadron was awarded the Boyd Trophy for these operations. Gulf War A Sea King of 846 NAS lifting load during exercise \\"Ocean Wave '97\\". In 1990, 846 NAS took part in the Gulf War. In six weeks the squadron flew a total of 1200 hours in support of Allied ground forces. After the end of hostilities the squadron moved to northern Iraq to assist with humanitarian relief for the Kurds. Yugoslav Wars In January 1993, 846 NAS was deployed until March aboard the carrier HMS Ark Royal to the Adriatic as part of UN operations in Yugoslavia. Shortly after returning to the UK the squadron was deployed to Northern Ireland to replace 707 NAS to provide support to security forces. It returned to the Balkans to provide air support for Multi- National Division-SW (SFOR), which was then commanded by the British, in Bosnia.

Having previously held leadership roles as a corporate attorney, venture capital investor and as a manager in the financial services industry, Levy is best known for having served as Chancellor of the New York City public schools, the largest school system in the U.S., from 2000 to 2002. Early life and education Levy's parents were Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. His father, a former textile merchant in Trier, Germany, owned a hardware store on East 59th Street, and the family lived in the Washington Heights neighborhood. A student leader throughout his education, he graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1970. He earned a B.S in 1974 from Cornell University's School of Industrial & Labor Relations. During his time at Cornell, he resided in the Telluride House.

The commission concluded the schools needed billions in new investment,Levy, Harold O., et al (1995). See \\"Report of the Commission on School Facilities and Maintenance Reform.\\" drawing Levy further into the struggle to improve education in New York City. The Commission's lobbying led to a massive infusion of funds to rehabilitate the city school buildings, as a result of which the school system ended its reliance on coal-fired boilers. The New York State Legislature subsequently elected Levy to be a member of the New York State Board of Regents. New York City School Chancellor (2000‚Äì2002) Levy became New York City School Chancellor in 2000, managing a $13 billion budget. He served for nearly three years, including during 9/11.

The New York City Board of Education voted 4 to 3 to make Levy interim chancellor, a move opposed by then-mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, Levy's business-like approach eventually engendered a mutual respect with Giuliani and other skeptics, and he was unanimously voted permanent chancellor after five months on the job. The subsequent programs he implemented were characteristically student- centered. He instituted the first K-12 student information reporting system, established the first new selective public high schools in over 60 years, and created programs offering students college-level instruction. He also ran what remains the country's largest summer school with over 300,000 students, which was subsequently recognized to have been among the most cost-effective interventions for low performing students.Matsudaira, Jordan (2008). \\"Mandatory Summer School and Student Achievement.\\" \\"Mandatory Summer School and Student Achievement: A Regression Discontinuity Analysis.\\" Journal of Econometrics, 142(2), 2008: 829-850.

The foundation's endowment was worth $641 million as of July 2016. Under Levy's leadership, the Cooke Foundation, Levy has dramatically increased the number of talented low-income students applying for Cooke Scholarships and has drawn national attention to the achievements of Cooke Scholars, who have defied stereotypes by graduating from top colleges and universities at the same rate as more affluent students. The Cooke Foundation's groundbreaking education research and media coverage for the research have also increased since Levy became executive director in 2014. In addition, he has started a new scholarship that enables Cooke Scholars to pursue graduate degrees at Oxford and Cambridge universities. Leading Cooke Foundation efforts to bring about equal opportunity in college admissions for outstanding low-income students across the United States, Levy has traveled around the nation and appeared in the media to discuss unjustified barriers that keep many academically qualified low-income students out of top colleges and universities. He has met with policymakers, business leaders and educators. The first-ever national convening of the principals of selective public high schools was organized by Levy in 2015 on the topic \\"Closing the Excellence Gap: Nurturing Talent of High-Achieving, Low-Income High School Students.\\" The conference led to the creation of the Coalition of Leaders for Advanced Student Success (CLASS), which works to ensure that the nation's brightest students, regardless of income, have the skills and knowledge to succeed in school and the workforce.

Davis excelled as a middle infielder at Duke University, where he was the captain of the baseball team and a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity until he graduated in 1940. After graduating from Duke, Davis played three seasons for the Philadelphia Athletics, batting .230 in 148 games. He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1942 amid World War II, and was assigned to Harvard University where he helped run the ROTC program. Davis also coached Harvard's baseball and squash teams. When he was discharged from the Navy in 1946, Davis returned to Durham to begin graduate school at Duke and play for the Durham Bulls, then a part of the Carolina League. Davis would play in the minor leagues, with teams including the Reidsville Luckies and the Raleigh Capitals, until 1952. After Bull Durham was released, Davis became a minor celebrity. He befriended the director of the film, Ron Shelton, and Shelton gave him a bit part in his movie Cobb about controversial baseball player Ty Cobb. Sometime during the mid 1950s Davis began working for the textile conglomerate Burlington Industries at their Gastonia Plant and advanced to become the Personnel Manager for the Domestics Division in Greensboro, NC until his retirement until the mid 1980s.

It operates AgustaWestland Wildcat AH.1 helicopters and provides armed reconnaissance and light transport support to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. Along with 845 and 846 naval air squadrons, it forms part of the Commando Helicopter Force. The squadron was re-formed from 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron on 1 September 1995. The unit is based at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset, a Royal Naval establishment, with helicopters drawn from an Army Air Corps pool and flown by Royal Marines and Royal Navy aircrews. Second World War 847 Naval Air Squadron was first formed at Lee-on-Solent on 1 June 1943, equipped with the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bomber. After working up, the squadron deployed aboard the aircraft carrier in November 1943.Sturtivant and Ballance 1994, pp. 272‚Äì273. Illustrious sailed for the Indian Ocean at the end of December, arriving at Colombo in Ceylon (now Sri-Lanka) on 30 January 1944.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 252. On 19 April 1944, the squadron took part in Operation Cockpit, a raid by aircraft from Illustrious and the American carrier against Sabang.Sturtivant and Ballance 1994, p. 272.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, pp. 271‚Äì272. The squadron took part in a raid by Illustriouss air wing against Port Blair on 19 June, but disbanded at Trincomalee in Ceylon on 30 June, its personnel and aircraft being absorbed into 810 Naval Air Squadron.Rohwer and H√ºmmelchen 1992, p. 284. Post-war operations The squadron reformed at RNAS Eglinton, near Derry in Northern Ireland, on 17 March 1956, equipped with three Fairey Gannet A.S.1 anti- submarine aircraft. It deployed to Nicosia in Cyprus on 8 April, with the role of carrying patrols to stop ships smuggling arms to insurgents during the Cyprus Emergency. The squadron received newer Gannet A.S.4s in June 1958, but returned to the United Kingdom in November 1959 after the end of the Emergency, disbanding at RNAS Yeovilton on 1 December 1959. The squadron reformed again at RNAS Culdrose in the Commando (i.e. troop support) role, equipped with Westland Whirlwind HAS.7 helicopters. It was based at Sembawang in Singapore (known as HMS Simbang) from April 1964, briefly supplementing its Whirlwinds by a single Hiller Raven light helicopter in June, but disbanded on 2 December that year. The squadron reformed at Sembawang on 14 March 1969, being split off from 848 Naval Air Squadron and equipped with 10 Westland Wessex HU.5s helicopters. The squadron operated both from shore and aboard ship, with detachments flying from the amphibious assault ships and and the landing ship amongst others. In November 1970, the squadron, operating from Intrepid and , took part in relief efforts following flooding in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and in January 1971 carried out relief work in Malaysia. The squadron stood down on 22 May 1971. Falklands War 847 Naval Air Squadron was reformed to take part in the Falklands campaign on 4 May 1982, operating 24 Westland Wessex HU.5 helicopters with Royal Naval personnel recruited mainly from RNAS Yeovilton. The aircraft were transported from the United Kingdom to the South Atlantic aboard RFA Engadine and the container vessel Atlantic Causeway.Burden et al. 1986, p. 280.Atlantic Causeway was sister ship to Atlantic Conveyor, which was hit and fatally damaged by an Exocet missile during the war. Atlantic Causeway disembarked 12 Wessexes of 847 NAS on 1 June 1982, with the detachment from Engadine arriving on 9 June. The squadron's Wessexes, together with those of 845 NAS initially operated from San Carlos and provided much needed transport support to the advance of British forces on Port Stanley, with forward operating bases being set up at Teal Inlet and Fitzroy. After the surrender of Argentine forces on the Falklands on 14 June 847 NAS relocated to Navy Point, a headland directly north of Port Stanley. 847 NAS remained in the Falklands until September 1982, providing air support to UK Forces. 847 NAS was one of the longest serving units to see action in the Falklands war, spending some 4 months on the islands in total, and leading some members of the squadron to refer to the unit as \\"84-who?\\" The squadron was disbanded on 24 September 1982. 1995 to the present 847 NAS reformed at RNAS Yeovilton with Royal Marines aircrews and REME engineers on 1 September 1995, from 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron, as a tactical support unit for the Royal Marines Commandos with Westland Lynx AH.7 and Westland Gazelle AH.1 helicopters. The squadron has been active in Sierra Leone and in Kosovo. The most significant deployment of recent years was to Operation Telic in Iraq in which it participated in the Battle of Basra. On 6 May 2006, one of the squadron's Lynxes, XZ614, was shot down over Basra in Iraq, by a surface- to-air missile (a Man Portable Air Defence System), killing 5 service personnel on board. Among the 5 killed were 847's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Darren Chapman; Wing Commander Coxen, who had been due to take command of the region's British helicopter forces, and Flight Lieutenant Sarah-Jayne Mulvihill; Coxen was the most senior British officer to die in the conflict and Mulvihill was the first British servicewoman to die in action in 22 years. This was the first British helicopter and only the second British aircraft downed (the first was an RAF Hercules) due to enemy fire, in the war. At the crash scene, British troops reportedly encountered rioting Iraqi civilians and were fired on by militia, while civilians were killed in the ensuing clashes. The crash led to a review of the vulnerability of helicopter transports in southern Iraq. In 2005, the Gazelle reconnaissance helicopter was retired from service with the squadron. Later, the Lynx AH.7s were replaced with the Lynx AH.9A variant, by the unit between May 2011 and Summer 2012. From September 2008 the unit was deployed to Camp Bastion as part of Operation Herrick for a 7-month deployment supporting troops on the ground and aerial movements. The unit returned in January 2011 for 5 months and again during January 2013 for 5 months. Current role In late 2013, it became the first front-line military squadron to receive the AgustaWestland Wildcat AH.1, which enables the Squadron to continue providing Battlefield Reconnaissance as part of Commando Helicopter Force. In June 2019 the squadron embarked on RFA Argus for a deployment to the Baltic Sea as part of the UK Joint Expeditionary Force. The squadron practised amphibious landings alongside the Merlins of 845 NAS as part of exercise Baltic Protector in the Baltic Sea.

Amalie's mother was an aunt of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, wife of Tsar Nicholas I. Her mother's husband, Karl Alexander F√ºrst von Thurn und Taxis (1770‚Äì1827), was invited by Napoleon for his new projects, and lived in Paris for years. In his absence, Princess Therese had a passionate affair with Count Maximilian-Emmanuel von Lerchenfeld. After her father, Graf von Lerchenfeld's death on 19 October 1809, Amalie was placed in the care of Therese's \\"von Sternfeld\\" relatives in Darmstadt (then in the Grand Duchy of Hesse), and the baby carried their surname after she was born. Amalie von Sternfeld was later brought to Regensburg, closer to Princess Therese and changed her surname to \\"Stargard\\". She was finally taken care of by the Lerchenfeld family and lived in their palace in Munich or at the family castle in K√∂fering near Regensburg. Finally, on 1 August 1823, the Grand Duke of Hesse gave the fifteen-year-old Amalie Stargard permission to carry the surname \\"von Lerchenfeld\\", but without rights to use the coat of arms or be listed in the family tree, which was the price for her extramarital birth. Youth In 1822, the fifteen-year-old beauty Amalie Stargard met young Fyodor Tyutchev, supernumerary attach√© of the Russian diplomatic mission who arrived from Saint Petersburg. Young nineteen-year-old Tyutchev fell in love and the two young people shared tender romantic feelings. Tyutchev's poem Tears or Slezy (–õ—é–±–ª—é, –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è, –ª–∞—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –æ—á–∞–º–∏ ‚Ä¶) coincides with one of their dates, and most likely dedicated to Amalie. Among other poems inspired by Amalie are K N. and Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe‚Ä¶ First marriage Arms of the Kr√ºdener family The blooming Amalie caught the attention of the first secretary of the Russian diplomatic representatives, Baron Alexander von Kr√ºdener (1786-1852). The old diplomat was of German Baltic descent, and the young but pragmatic princess opted for a baron's noble title rather than the untitled young poet Tyutchev. The letters and diaries of Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld illuminate Tyutchev's first years as a diplomat in Munich (1822‚Äì26), giving details of his frustrated love affair for Amalie, nearly involving a duel with his colleague (on 19 January 1825). On 31 August 1825 the seventeen-year-old Amalie von Lerchenfeld wed Baron Kr√ºdener in K√∂fering. Her first child, Nikolai-Arthur, was born on . Tyutchevs and Kr√ºdeners The Tyutchevs and Kr√ºdeners continued to frequent the same diplomatic society, they were nearly next-door neighbors with the Tyutchevs living at Karolinenplatz 1, and the Kr√ºdeners a five-minute walk away on Briennerstrasse 15. Fyodor Tyutchev continued to see Amalie, but in families. Prince Karl, brother of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and the king himself were spellbound by the beautiful Amalie. Ludwig I ordered an oil portrait of Amalie to the artist Joseph Stieler for his Gallery of Beauties. It was completed in 1828 and today can be viewed at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich. In April 1836, Fyodor Tyutchev dedicated to Amalie his poem Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe‚Ä¶ (I Remember the Golden Time‚Ä¶). This poem is not about love, but a reminiscence of love, of their past meetings on the hills of Regensburg. The poem was later interpreted by Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg, in Opus 25: Six Romances after F. Tutchev for singer and piano (1945) in the romance if the same name. Russian high society In April 1836, Baron von Kr√ºdener received a promotion and left for Russia. Amalie brought to Saint Petersburg a bunch of Tyutchev's poems (more than 100). She gave dozens more of them to the poet's former colleague, Prince Ivan Gagarin. Gagarin wrote down several poems and gave them to read to Alexander Pushkin, publisher of Sovremennik, the most influential literary magazine in Russia. Pushkin was very excited and published them immediately. Thus, Amalie helped Tyutchev gain recognition in his home country. Bibliographers of Pushkin like Alexander Shik state that Alexander Pushkin felt for Amalie and tried to court her at one of the balls. Natalia Pushkina, one of the most beautiful women in Russia, had to \\"have a talk\\" with her husband, after which the poet was joking that \\"Madonna has a heavy hand‚Ä¶\\"The Married Pushkin by Alexander Shik, p. 68, 1936 Count Alexander von Benckendorff was another passionate admirer of Baroness Amalie von Kr√ºdener. Her influence was so great that he even secretly converted to Catholicism. In Imperial Russia, where Orthodoxy was the state religion, this action would be punished by years of katorga (the secret was revealed only after death of Benckendorff). He also helped to reinstate Fyodor Tyutchev at the Ministry after he was fired in 1843, and arranged the meeting of Tyutchev with Nicholas I of Russia and Minister Karl Nesselrode. His Majesty Nicholas I of Russia himself was not indifferent to Amalie; 25 November 1836 she received a luxurious fur coat as a gift from the Tsar that she received on the rights of his cousine. Marriage to Adlerberg In 1848, the 40-year-old Amalie von Kr√ºdener gave birth to a child out-of-wedlock on 17 March. The father of her newborn son Nikolo was the 29-year-old Count Nikolay Adlerberg. The child received the status of the adoptive son of Nikolai Veniavsky. Baron von Kr√ºdener was appointed Ambassador and Plenipotentiary Minister at the Court of the King of Sweden and Norway, but Amalie pretended to be ill and stayed in Saint Petersburg. They never met again, as Baron von Kr√ºdener died of infarction in Stockholm in 1852. Amalie finally found love, peace and happiness with Nikolay Adlerberg, whom she married officially in 1855. Orphanage in Simferopol Building of the Adlerberg Orphan-asylum in Simferopol During the Crimean War, Nikolay Adlerberg served as Governor- General of Simferopol and Taurida Governorate in 1854‚Äì56. The war actions aggravated the situation of children in Crimea as many lost their parents and had no relatives or anywhere to go. The children were brought to Simferopol during the Siege of Sevastopol (1854) along with wounded soldiers. Simferopol's city council had been trying to open an orphan-asylum since 1848, but there were always some problems due to lack of money or necessary documents. Taking into consideration the circumstances, Countess Adlerberg decided to avoid bureaucratic formalities and on 31 December 1854 opened an asylum for fourteen orphans with her own money.–ù.–í. –ö–∞—Ä–º–∞–∑–∏–Ω–∞ \\"–†–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ-–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ã –¢–∞–≤—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ì—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–∏ –≤–æ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ XIX ‚Äì –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ XX –≤–µ–∫–∞\\" –ê–ö–¢–£–ê–õ–¨–ù–´–ï –ü–†–û–ë–õ–ï–ú–´ –ò–°–¢–û–†–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–û–ì–û –ü–ï–î–ê–ì–û–ì–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–û–ì–û –ù–ê–°–õ–ï–î–ò–Ø —Å—Ç—Ä. 174-176 In 1857, the Committee of the Board of Guardians of Orphan- asylums () approved the transformation of the temporary orphan-asylum founded by Countess Adlerberg into the asylum working on regular basis. It was also named after Amalie Adlerberg. In 1869, the Amalie Adlerberg Orphan-asylum moved into a new building. In a letter to Governor of Simferopol Grigory Zhukovsky, Empress Maria Alexandrovna insisted that the asylum retain the name of its founder, in contrast to other asylums across Russia, that were all named after Maria Alexandrovna. The building of the asylum is still there at the crossing of Pushkinskaya and Gogolevskaya streets and it now houses the Museum of Ethnography of Crimean Nations.–ë–ª–∞–≥–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∑–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –°–∏–º—Ñ–µ—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª—è XIX ‚Äì –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –•–• –≤–µ–∫–∞ Years in Helsinki Amalie Adlerberg (1865) In 1866‚Äì81 Amalie lived in Helsinki, during Nikolay Adlerberg's service as Governor-General of Finland. As a Catholic, Countess Adlerberg helped to establish the Roman Catholic parish and their cathedral in Helsinki, a project earlier decisively contributed by countess Leopoldina von Berg, n√©e di Cicogna di Mozzone, the Italian wife of previous governor-general, field marshal Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg. In 1873, the countess managed to arrange her granddaughter (Helene de Fontenilliat, born 1855) to marry the wealthy lord of Kyt√§j√§ Constantin Linder, who had recently lost his first wife, countess Marie Musin-Pushkin. Helene gained a stepson, the later-notorious wastrel Hjalmar Linder of Mustio, and soon gave birth to her own child. Last years in Munich In 1881, after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, Count and Countess Adlerberg moved for permanent residence to Munich, Germany. They had no house and first stayed at Maximilian Lerchenfeld's house on Amalienstrasse 93. Later, the Adlerbergs acquired a plot of land and built a home in the town of Tegernsee on Schwaighofstrasse 2. Amalie died in Tegernsee on 21 June 1888. She was buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Laurentius in Rottach-Egern am Tegernsee. The church is situated on the shore of the lake opposite the Amalie's mansion known under the name of \\"Haus Adlerberg am See\\".

It grows at altitudes of 1,200‚Äì3,500 metres, usually in pure forests, sometimes mixed with the Tien Shan variety of Siberian fir (Abies sibirica var. semenovii). Its name was given in honour of Alexander von Schrenk (1816‚Äì1876). Description Picea schrenkiana tree in Rog√≥w Arboretum, Poland Picea schrenkiana is a large evergreen tree growing to tall (rarely to ), with a trunk diameter of up to . It has a narrow conical crown with level branches and sometimes pendulous branchlets. The shoots are pale buff-brown, and glabrous (hairless). The leaves are needle-like, 1.5-3.5 cm long, rhombic in cross-section, dark green with inconspicuous stomatal lines. The cones are cylindric‚Äìconic, 6‚Äì12 cm long and 2 cm broad, purple when young, maturing dark brown and opening to 2.5‚Äì3.5 cm broad 5‚Äì7 months after pollination; the scales are moderately stiff and smoothly rounded. Subspecies There are two subspecies: *Picea schrenkiana subsp. schrenkiana. Eastern Tian Shan, in Kazakhstan and Xinjiang. Leaves longer, 2‚Äì3.5 cm long. *Picea schrenkiana subsp. tianshanica (Rupr.) Bykov. Western Tian Shan, in Kyrgyzstan. Leaves shorter, 1.5‚Äì2.5 cm long. It is closely related to, and in many respects intermediate between Morinda spruce (Picea smithiana) from further south in the Himalaya, and Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) further north in Siberia. Uses Schrenk's spruce is an important tree in central Asia for timber and paper production, where few other large trees exist. Its slower growth compared to Norway Spruce reduces its importance outside of its native range.

The games were developed by the German studio Bright Future and EA Sports. The game was called Total Club Manager until the name changed to FIFA Manager with the FIFA Manager 06. Before FIFA Manager and Total Club Manager, EA Sports released FIFA Soccer Manager (1997) and The FA Premier League Football Manager 99, 2000, 2001 and 2002, but while the first managed to attract some attention, the latter were released when the managing games market for non- Championship Manager titles was close to non-existent, and after two unsuccessful titles, it was dropped. However, by 2001, several employees of German developer Ascaron moved to EA, and the first game, Fussball Manager 2002, was released in Germany only, as a test for a potential series. The game had positive reception, and a year later Total Club Manager 2003 was released, with Bobby Robson on the cover (for the second time, after FIFA Soccer Manager). One of the key features of Anstoss 3 was the ability to actually play the games after Anstoss Action was released. Although it could be played as a stand-alone game, it only reached the full potential when used with the manager game. This feature, only present on other games with limited geographical distribution, the Spanish PC F√∫tbol, was included for buyers of both TCM 2004 and FIFA 2004, which could use the Football Fusion function. Some fans managed to control games in TCM 2003 by hacking the configuration files, but data loss and corruption was frequent. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill appeared on the cover of TCM 2004. Criticized by a confusing interface, EA reworked it for TCM 2005, with a more sleek design. European Champion with former FC Porto and Chelsea manager Jos√© Mourinho was selected for the main cover. While the TCM series has been released for Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2, the FIFAM series is only available for Windows. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed for EA Canada by Budcat Creations.  Games =FIFA Soccer Manager FIFA Soccer Manager (or simply FSM) is a 1997 football managing computer game developed and published by Electronic Arts by their EA Sports label. It was followed by The FA Premier League Football Manager and the Total Club Manager series. An update for the game is freely available from Electronic Arts' FTP. One of the first games in the genre developed for Microsoft Windows, FSM included five playable leagues (England, Scotland, Italy, Germany and France) and all UEFA competitions, including around 7500 players. FSM was also known for a complete stadium builder, where combining 300 different pieces (stands and roofs) allowed the creation of stadiums with over 300,000 seats (a figure which is still double the highest stadium capacity in the world). While the overall presentation (which included short FMV clips for some events, such as cup/league wins and being sacked) was praised, the interface relied too much on submenus that could not only be reached outside the main section, slowing down gameplay. Also, when the better players retired, they were replaced only by average younger players (rated between 75 and 80), which harmed the possibilities of games over 15 years long, combined with the impossibility of joining a different club.

His parents‚Äîand perhaps Mantino himself‚Äîwere natives of Tortosa, Spain, which place they left at the time of the banishment of the Jews from Spain (1492). Mantino studied medicine and philosophy at the universities of Padua and Bologna. Having graduated, he established himself at the latter place, and devoted his hours of leisure to the translation of scientific works from Hebrew into Latin. By these translations he soon acquired a high reputation, and he was befriended by the highest dignitaries of the court of Pope Clement VII. Arabic-Hebrew-Latin dictionary by Jacob Mantino and Leo Africanus. The war of 1527 compelled Mantino to leave the Pontifical States. He settled at Verona, where the new bishop, Gian Matteo Giberti, protected him. In 1528, when Giberti left Verona for Rome, Mantino decided to settle at Venice, where the Council of Ten exempted him from wearing the Judenhut. This privilege was granted him, at first for a term of several months, upon the recommendation of the French and English ambassadors, the papal legate, and other dignitaries whom he numbered among his patients. At the expiration of the prescribed term Mantino found an influential protector in another of his patients, Teodoro Trivulzio, marshal of France and governor of Genoa; the latter, urging his own services to the Venetian Republic, insisted that the council should make the exemption perpetual. The efforts of Henry VIII of England to get rid of his wife Catherine on the pretext that their marriage was contrary to the Biblical law, and that the dispensation obtained from Pope Julius II was invalid, involved Mantino in difficulties. Henry sent Richard Croke to Italy in order to obtain opinions favorable to his case, and the latter addressed himself to Jewish as well as to Christian scholars. Pope Clement VII, in his turn, consulted Mantino, who decided against Henry. This decision created for Mantino many enemies in Venice, where Croke had won a favorable opinion from the famous physician and scholar Elijah Menahem Halfon, among others. Meanwhile, the Messianic dreamer Solomon Molcho, whom Mantino had energetically opposed while he was in Venice, went to Rome, followed by Mantino. Having many friends and protectors at the court of Clement VII, Mantino soon acquired great influence in Rome, which he employed in crushing Molcho. Mantino attained the zenith of his influence at the accession to the throne of Pope Paul III (1534), who appointed him his physician. This high position did not prevent Mantino from concerning himself with the affairs of the Jewish community of Rome, in whose records he appears as a member of the rabbinate, with the title \\"gaon.\\" In 1544, for some unknown reason, Mantino returned to Venice, where again he was exempted from wearing the Jews' hat. Five years later he accompanied, as physician, the Venetian ambassador to Damascus, where he died soon after his arrival. Writings Mantino translated the following commentaries of Averroes: * \\"Paraphrasis Averrois de Partibus et Generatione Animalium,\\" with the commentary of Levi ben Gershon (dedicated to Pope Leo X.; Rome, 1521); * commentary (the compendium) on Aristotle's \\"Metaphysics\\"; * the \\"middle commentaries\\" on Aristotle's \\"Isagoge\\"‚Äîbooks i.-iv. of \\"Topics\\" and \\"Poetics\\" (Venice, 1550); * commentary on Plato's \\"Republic\\" (dedicated to Pope Paul III.); * proem to the large commentary on Aristotle's \\"Physics\\"; * the large commentary on the third book of Aristotle on the soul; * proem to book xii. of Aristotle's \\"Meta-physics\\"; * the \\"middle commentary\\" on Aristotle's \\"Physics.\\" He translated also Averroes' medical work \\"Colliget\\" (\\"Kullayot\\"), the first book of Avicenna's \\"Canon,\\" and Maimonides' \\"Shemonah Pera·∏≥im.\\" References *Wolf, Bibl.

Conquest operated primarily on routes within Texas from its hub in Austin (at the now closed Robert Mueller Municipal Airport). History Rafael Rivas and Victor Rivas, two brothers from Queens, New York City, created the concept of Conquest Airlines. The airline began in April 1988 with flights from Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas to Austin and Dallas; the airline later added Corpus Christi, McAllen, and San Antonio. In the late 1980s the airline shifted its hub and operations to Austin. Rafael Rivas, who became the executive vice president of Conquest, said that the airline chose Austin as its hub since Dallas and Houston were not centrally located in Texas. Rivas added that by being located in Austin, the airline would avoid competition from regional airline carriers operating in Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas. In addition the airline catered to passengers traveling within Texas instead of passengers planning to do inter-state travel.Patoski, Joe Nick. \\"Filling a Niche.\\" Texas Monthly. November 1989. 82. Rivas added that his airline did not intend to compete with Southwest Airlines; it intended to compete with the automobile. Around November 1989 the airline's aircraft carried 21,000 passengers on 2,500 trips per month. Conquest originally had its headquarters on the grounds of Southeast Texas Regional Airport in unincorporated Jefferson County, Texas, Texas.\\"SEC News Digest.\\" Securities and Exchange Commission.

The City of Austin granted its first ever tax abatement in exchange for the relocation of the corporate headquarters. The abatement relieved the airline of about $1.3 million worth of aircraft property taxes over a 7-year period. Austin politicians said that the relocation of Conquest would lead to the employment of 200 Austinites at Conquest for at least 14 years and a $47 tax base that would contribute to the stabilization of property values after the end of the abatement. In 1991, the Airline expanded its network and began international flights between San Antonio, TX and Monterrey, Mexico. The company promoted John W. Jones as the Director of Stations, who was instrumental in mapping the company's growth as an international airline. Unfortunately the economic conditions generated by the first Gulf War prevented the airline from continuing flights into Mexico and the international service was suspended. Aeromexico's regional airline, Aerolitoral was already operating flights between San Antonio, TX and Monterry, Mexico. The market was not large enough to sustain the additional capacity offered by Conquest Airlines. Jones later went on in 1994 to manage the international operations for Aerolitoral (today known as Aeromexico Connect). The airline expanded throughout the Southeastern United States and in 1993 opened a hub in Birmingham, Alabama. From Birmingham, the company offered flights to Little Rock (AR), Mobile (AL), Atlanta (GA), Greenville (SC) and Charleston (SC). The airline connected both hubs with service via an Austin-Tyler-Little Rock-Birmingham route. In 1993 the airline had 16 aircraft and 300 employees. Afterwards the airline's business declined. During a point in which the airline had about one and one half years of the abatement left, officials from the airline and the City of Austin acknowledged that the airline may fail as a company. In an attempt to survive, the airline removed 100 employees and 10 aircraft. In 1994 Conquest's tax base was appraised at $4.7 million.

Formed in 2005, the band shares a name with the British independent school Abingdon School, in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, the all-male school where the rock band Radiohead was established. Biography=Formation and influences Abingdon Boys School began in 2005 when Takanori Nishikawa, known for his pop music as TM Revolution, decided to return to his rock roots in Luis-Mary with guitarist Sunao. They were introduced to guitarist Hiroshi Shibasaki (ex- Wands) and continued to discuss forming a band until an offer came to record a song for manga series Nana. The three presented a demo to producer Toshiyuki Kishi who became the fourth member of the band. The origin of the name comes from a combination of Nishikawa's love of cars' anti-lock braking system and the resemblance of the initials to the pronunciation of the Tokyo district Ebisu where the band practiced. When searching on the internet for a backronym Nishikawa discovered Abingdon School and the connection to Radiohead, whose members are of the same generation. A.B.S are also all from the same generation and each fell in love with music when they were in school, so they thought \\"it would be cool if we could go back to that feeling again.\\" Abingdon Boys School intended to bring song structure back to pop and rock music, with elements such as \\"intros, vocal lines, guitar solos and instrumental sections\\". The band's style recalls 1980s hair-band era Van Halen and edgier '90s rock outfits such as Jane's Addiction. History In 2005, Abingdon Boys School released its first song, \\"Stay Away\\", an English-language song written by Nishikawa and composed by Shibasaki for the sh≈çjo manga and anime series Nana tribute album Love for Nana ~Only 1 Tribute~. The band also recorded a cover of the Buck-Tick song that was featured on the tribute album Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-. The band's first live concert was performed on November 24, 2005, alongside Uverworld and Tsubakiya Quartet, a show presented by music magazine CD Data. On September 3, 2006, the band announced that they would make their official debut through Sony Music Japan's Epic Records, which was also the label of Nishikawa's solo project T.M. Revolution. The band performed at the Japanese leg of Live Earth in Tokyo on July 7, 2007, and their first self titled album was released on October 17, 2007. Their debut peaked at no.2 on the Oricon charts. On July 16, 2008, Abingdon Boys School released a live DVD from the concert they held in February 2008. In November 2009, Abingdon Boys School went on a tour through Europe, securing a record deal with Germany label Gan-Shin that saw their debut available in Europe. The band played shows in Helsinki, Stockholm, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Paris, London and Moscow. In London, the band played in Camden Underworld venue, famous in Japan as it was the place where Sadistic Mika Band had played in 1975, the first Japanese rock band to ever tour in Europe. In Helsinki, Andy McCoy of 1980s hair-metal band Hanoi Rocks showed up unannounced, one of the groups idols. A B-sides compilation album was then released in Japan titled Teaching Materials. Shortly after, a second studio album was announced for January 27, 2010, titled Abingdon Road. In addition to 6 new tracks, the album contained singles released since the band's first full album and a cover of \\"Sweetest Coma Again\\", originally found on Luna Sea Memorial Cover Album -Re:birth-. They released a book containing scores of their singles on November 12, 2010.http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/abs/info.html On August 7, 2012, Abingdon Boys School released \\"We Are\\" internationally, their first single in two and a half years. The title track was featured as the theme song for the PlayStation 3 video game Sengoku Basara HD Collection, which was released on September 5, 2012. Abingdon Boys School performed at Inazuma Rock Festival 2018, marking their first live in six years. They performed at the festival again the following year and announced their first tour in 10 years for March 2020. However, the tour has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Work used in media All of the band's singles are songs that have been used in anime and video games; perhaps owing to Nishikawa's personal interests, having gone so far as to voice a few anime roles himself. \\"Innocent Sorrow\\" was used as the opening for the D.Gray-Man anime; \\"Howling\\" and \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" for Darker Than Black and its sequel Ry≈´sei no Gemini; \\"Nephilim\\" for the PlayStation 3 game Folklore; \\"Blade Chord\\" and \\"Jap\\" for the Sengoku Basara series; \\"Strength\\" for the Soul Eater anime, and \\"Kimi no Uta\\" for Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. \\"Fre@k $HoW\\", the b-side off their \\"Innocent Sorrow\\" single, was also used in a tribute compilation CD for the movie Death Note 2: The Last Name. A slightly modified version of the b-side off their \\"Jap\\" single, dubbed \\"Valkyrie -Lioleia Mix-\\", was also featured in the Monster Hunter tribute album Monster Hunter 5th Anniversary.

She is presumably depicted as welcoming Zeus, who impregnated her in the form of a shower of gold. Given that this is one of Rembrandt's most magnificent paintings, it is not out of the question that he cherished it, but it also may have been difficult to sell because of its eight-by-ten-foot size. Although the artist's wife Saskia was the original model for Dana√´, Rembrandt later changed the figure's face to that of his mistress Geertje Dircx. The reworking changed the positions of, among other things, the head, outstretched arm and legs of Dana√´.Corpus, 212-214 The painting has been considerably cut down. It has a hard-to-read signature with a date ending in \\"6\\", but this may not be genuine.Corpus, 214 It was seriously vandalized in 1985, but has been restored. Vandalism On June 15, 1985 Rembrandt's painting was attacked by Bronius Maigys, a Soviet Lithuanian national later judged insane; he threw sulfuric acid on the canvas and cut it twice with his knife. The entire central part of the composition was turned into a mixture of spots with a conglomerate of splashes and areas of dripping paint. The worst damage was to the face and hair of Dana√´, her right arm, and legs. The process of restoring the painting began the same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing the surface of the painting with water; they kept the painting in the vertical position, and sprayed water at the painting to prevent further degradation of the painting. The restoration of the painting was accomplished between 1985 and 1997 by staff of the State Hermitage's Laboratory of Expert Restoration of Easel Paintings: Ye. N. Gerasimov (group leader), A. G. Rakhman, and G. A. Shirokov, with the participation of T. P. Alioshina in matters of scientific methodology.

The character was played by actress Jane Hall in 1989, Danielle Carter in 1994, and Belinda Emmett from 1996 to 1999. Megan Connolly temporarily played the character in 1998 while Belinda Emmett received treatment for cancer. Character development In 1998, Jason Herbison from Inside Soap reported that the show's producers planned on giving the character a \\"sleek new look\\". This required Emmett to spend longer in the make-up department as they straightened her naturally curly hair. Storylines Rebecca arrives in Summer Bay in to visit her father, Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) after being invited by Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). When Rebecca senses Donald and Bobby acting strangely, she feels as if they are talking about her behind her back. Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson), inadvertently let it slip to Rebecca that Bobby is, Donald's daughter and Bobby's half-sister and cousin as a result of an affair he had with Rebecca's aunt Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). Rebecca reacts badly to this news, running away, causing locals to think she has committed suicide when her bracelet is found on the beach. Lance and Martin look for her in the water but Rebecca is revealed to be alive and well hiding out in a caravan at the Caravan Park where Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and his family, The Fletchers live. Rebecca then gives Lance and Martin a surprise when she appears in the water where they are searching for her. After Donald explains everything about Bobby and Morag, Rebecca stays in Summer Bay for the school holidays. Rebecca and Steven begin dating much to the chagrin of Donald who feels that the relationship is a detriment to Rebecca's musical studies. Donald eventually relents and allowed Rebecca to attend a Summer Bay High school dance with Steven before leaving to return to school in the city. Five years later, Rebecca returns and soon has her eye on local schoolteacher Luke Cunningham (John Adam), who is employed by Donald. Donald tries everything to keep them apart, including giving Luke extra work at School. However, Luke soon breaks up with Rebecca of his own accord and receives a rock through the windscreen for his car for his trouble. Rebecca leaves soon after. In 1996, Rebecca returns to Summer Bay permanently and is involved in a number of storylines including being stalked by Chloe Richards' (Kristy Wright) rapist Brad Cooper (Bruce Samazan) and losing her hearing after a prank played by Casey Mitchell (Rebecca Croft) goes awry. During this visit, Rebecca learns that Donald is engaged to Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons), a woman nearly 30 years his junior. Rebecca is against the marriage but after a confrontation with Marilyn she accepts her and attends the wedding. Rebecca briefly dates Steven again, before falling hard for her good friend Travis Nash (Nic Testoni), whose girlfriend Kelly Watson (Katrina Hobbs) left him and Summer Bay for the city. At the end of 1997, Rebecca and Travis marry in an intimate ceremony on the beach with Donald present as the celebrant. In early 1998, Rebecca and Travis take over the tenancy on Summer Bay House and the Caravan Park when Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance) moves to the Carrington Ranges with her fiance Ian Routledge (Patrick Dickson). They also take on the care of Pippa's remaining foster children Sam Marshall (Ryan Clark), Teigan Brook (Sally Marrett) and Justine Welles (Bree Desborough). Sam finds it hard to cope with Travis and Rebecca as his new foster parents and ends up living with Donald. Pippa's adoptive daughter, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) feels herself being squeezed out of her former home by the Nashes, luckily a solution is reached when she rents Travis' old place. The following year, Rebecca and Travis sail away from Summer Bay on a tall ship and set up home in Canada. It has since been mentioned in passing by Donald they have had a son, who has not been named. Actress deaths  Belinda Emmett was forced to leave her role of Rebecca on Home and Away in 1999 after the actress was diagnosed with breast cancer. She would not return to the show, but later took a small role in another Seven Network drama, All Saints. Belinda Emmett died 11 November 2006. Megan Connolly briefly took the role of Rebecca while Emmett received cancer treatment in 1998. Connolly died of a heroin overdose on 6 September 2001.Super Aussie soaps: behind the scenes of Australia's best loved TV shows Reception Emmett's portrayal of Rebecca earned her a nomination for the \\"Best New Talent\\" Logie Award in 1997.

Blanquefort is an outlying commune of the Bordeaux metropolitan area. The commune consists of historic Blanquefort and Caychac, which is further out from central Bordeaux and was formerly a commune in its own right. Historic Blanquefort includes the ruins of a small medieval fortress and a nineteenth-century park, the Parc de Majolan, complete with a maze-like grotto and small artificial ruins which were in vogue at that time. Blanquefort is well connected to the rest of the agglomeration by the Bordeaux bus services, including services most of the night. It also has a train station with regular services to central Bordeaux. The Bordeaux tram system is projected to connect with Blanquefort in 2013. Blanquefort, which is located in a famous wine-producing area, has a notable educational institution for viticulture. History The oldest signs of human habitation in the commune are pieces of pottery dating back to 2000 BC. This is in line with the very early settlement of all south-western France by pre- historic peoples (e.g. in the P√©rigord) A Roman military post was set up in the area, to ensure the security of the road to Noviomagus in the Medoc. Tiles and coins from the Roman occupation have been found around the site of the later fortress. In the ninth century, a first medieval fortification was built. The white stone gave the fort the name \\"White Fort\\", in Latin Blanca Fortis, which evolved into the modern name Blanquefort. During the English occupation of Aquitaine, the fortifications were expanded into a royal fortress at the end of the thirteenth century by Edward I of England. At the end of the Hundred Years War, the fortress became French. A wine-producing village grew around the fortifications, probably worked predominantly by serfs. Blanquefort is located in a region which has been notable for wine production since ancient times. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a number of small chateaux were constructed in the prosperous village by wealthy wine merchants. The economy of the village focussed on wine production. In the seventeenth century, the Ch√¢teau Dillon was built in Blanquefort by the Dillon family which migrated to Blanquefort from Ireland. During the French Revolution, as part of the central Gironde, the village was loosely connected with the conflict between Gironde deputies and Jacobins in the national government. As with the other nearby areas, the village would probably have supported a moderate course for the revolution and there was probably support for the federalist constitutional proposals which were popular in Bordeaux. The village was well within the territory of the federalist insurrection of 1793. Unfortunately, no historical records exist which discuss the politics of the village during revolution. In 1900, the population was 2000. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the reliance of the village economy on wine production became a problem as economic crises took their toll. In 1962, the now-impoverished village created an industrial zone on former marshland. Combined with its proximity to Bordeaux, this led to a rapid growth of the village, which was now becoming a suburb of expanding Bordeaux. In the early twenty-first century, as a result of Bordeaux's continuing expansion, new developments have been built to allow the population of Blanquefort to grow further. PopulationEconomy Since 1972, Blanquefort has been the location of a Ford transmission plant, which occupies a 103 ha site in the industrial zone. The plant was the result of an investment of 600 mIllion French francs, expected to generate 2,000 jobs. Initially, it was built to manufacture Ford C3 automatic transmission units for Ford's European models, with engine sizes from 1300 cc to 3000 cc. Despite recent reports that the plant has been sold by Ford in response to their need for money, it will continue for now to supply transmissions to the company.

The movement is named after the town Kopys in the Vitebsk Region of present-day Belarus, where Rabbi Yehuda Leib Schneersohn settled after his father's death. The Kopust dynasty had four rebbes in total. Following the death of its last rebbe, the movement's membership dwindled and now has a few chasidim in Jerusalem and Chicago.  History  Kopust is an offshoot of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The Chabad movement, founded by Shneur Zalman of Liadi, produced multiple offshoot groups through its over 200-year history. The death of the third Chabad rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneersohn led to a dispute over his succession leading to the founding of Kopust. At the time of its founding, Kopust sought to be the rightful heir to the legacy of the first three rebbes of Chabad. Many of the greatest adherents of 19th-century Chabad were in fact Chassidim of Kopust.  Founding  Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, also known as the \\"Tzemach Tzedek\\", had seven sons. Following Rabbi Menachem Mendel's death 1866, a dispute arose among several of his sons over the father's succession. While the youngest son, Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn assumed the title of rebbe in the town of Lubavitch, another brother, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Schneersohn, assumed the title of rebbe in the town of Kopys in Belarus.

Available at HebrewBooks.org  Kopust today  It is thought that after the death of the fourth rebbe of Kopust, the adherents of the Kopuster movement rejoined the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The oldest extant Chabad synagogue in Israel, the Ohel Yitzchok (◊ê◊î◊ú ◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß) synagogue in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem--also called the Baal HaTanya Shul (: \\"Baal HaTanya's synagogue\\")--active since 1900, was originally affiliated with Kopust. When the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Yosef Yizhak Shneerson, visited Jerusalem in 1929, he did not visit this synagogue.  Relationship with Chabad-Lubavitch  While the Kopust movement originally was at odds with the Chabad-Lubavitch movement over the successor to the third Chabad rebbe, the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn referred to the Rebbes of Kopust as \\"Admorim\\", or rebbes. This may be seen as a sign of respect to the Kopust dynasty.

Folklore: Bangor Ghost  In early 2009 firefighters began reporting ghost sightings inside Butte County Fire Station 55. According to legend it would pin down firefighters in their beds, pull the ignition cords from the fire engine, and perform other mischievous acts. Its most notable trait was the loud wailing screech it emitted. The sightings around the station stopped in 2011 when the fire station was demolished and replaced. According to local legend, replacing the station only released the spirit, which now haunts the local hills.

He is best known as the longtime business and recording partner for the singer, songwriter and musician Enya alongside his wife, poet and lyricist Roma Ryan. Born and raised in Dublin, Ryan gained initial recognition in the 1970s and 1980s for his work with several artists including Gary Moore, Planxty, Christy Moore and Clannad.  Early life  Nicholas Dominick Ryan was born in 1949 in Dublin, Ireland. As a youngster, he won a song contest with a rendition of \\"In the Mood\\" by Glenn Miller for which the prize was to meet the Beatles, one of his favourite bands. However, Ryan could not claim the prize as he could not afford the fare to England to see them.Ryan, Nicky. Liner notes in The Very Best of Enya ‚Äì Collector's Edition (2009). Warner Music. After finishing school, Ryan worked as a teacher at St. Mary's School for Deaf Girls in Dublin, where he experimented with sound engineering to create a way for the deaf children to \\"hear\\" music. He designed a speaker system based on the lower end of a pipe organ that allowed for considerable bass to travel across a spring floor in the school's dance room and in their chests, so they can detect the rhythm. \\"It was an upright speaker consisting of a 14in square box, about six feet tall, and about six inches from the floor ‚Äì with a 12in speaker facing upwards, and a three inch port below that. And it worked very well. ... The floor shook ‚Äì and the kids danced away, as they were entitled to.\\"  Career  In the 1970s and 1980s, Ryan gained recognition for his involvement with several artists including Gary Moore, Planxty, and Christy Moore. Ryan was introduced to the family Celtic band Clannad by their manager Fachtna O'Kelly. In 1975, he became the sound engineer for the family band Clannad and from 1976, their new manager along with his wife Roma Ryan after O'Kelly left to manage The Boomtown Rats. In 1980, Ryan persuaded Enya, the younger sister of siblings M√°ire, P√≥l and Ciar√°n Brennan, to join the band with them and twin uncles, Noel and P√°draig Duggan. During her two-year stint in the group, Ryan and Enya often discussed his idea of recording many vocal tracks and layering them to create a sound effect inspired by the wall of sound technique developed by Phil Spector. In 1982, the Ryans left Clannad and formed a partnership with Enya after the latter wished to pursue a solo career, with Ryan her producer and arranger and Roma her lyricist. For the next two years, Enya lived with the Ryans who then lived in Artane, a northern Dublin suburb while she practised her music skills and recorded a selection of demos. In September 1983, the three became directors of their music company Aigle Music, with \\"aigle\\" being the French word for \\"eagle\\". Using a mixing board originally made for Clannad, the three constructed a home recording facility and named it Aigle Studio.

For almost a century, Goodwin's gravestone in the Fairview Cemetery read \\"Erected to the memory of an unknown child whose remains were recovered after the disaster to the Titanic April 15th 1912\\". Initial DNA testing in 2002 pointed to third class passenger Eino Viljami Panula as the probable individual; however, subsequent testing in 2007 conclusively identified the child's remains as those of fellow third class toddler Sidney Leslie Goodwin. The burial The grave of the unknown child in Fairview Cemetery The body of a fair-haired toddler was the fourth pulled from the ocean by the recovery ship CS Mackay-Bennett, on 17 April 1912. The description read: The sailors aboard the Mackay-Bennett, who were very shocked by the discovery of the unknown boy's body, paid for a monument, and he was buried on 4 May 1912 with a copper pendant placed in his coffin by recovery sailors that read \\"Our Babe\\". Identification Before 2002, Sidney was known simply as \\"The Unknown Child\\". His body, identified as that of a child around two years old, was initially believed to be that of either a two-year-old Swedish boy, G√∂sta P√•lsson; or a two-year-old Irish boy, Eugene Rice, two other fair-haired toddlers who perished in the sinking. In 2002, the American PBS television series Secrets of the Dead misidentified the body as Eino Viljami Panula, a 13-month-old Finnish baby, based on DNA testing of three teeth and a small, weathered bone.Titanic: The Myths and Legacy of a DisasterLos Angeles Times The show traced the child's DNA to a Finnish woman by the name of Magda Schleifer whose grandmother's sister was Maria Emilia Panula. Another relative of the Panula family, Hildur Panula-Heinonen, has written several extensive articles related to the family. In 2007, however, Canadian researchers at Lakehead University tested the child's HVS1, a type of mitochondrial DNA molecule, and it did not match the Panula family. DNA extracted from the exhumed remains and DNA provided by a surviving maternal relative helped positively match the remains to Sidney, and the re- identification was announced on 30 July 2007. Although the bodies of two other children, both older boys, were recovered, it was Sidney who came to be a symbol of all the children lost in the sinking. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a marker was recently added to the memorial with his name and dates of birth and death. A pair of his shoes was donated to Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in 2002 by the descendants of a Halifax police officer who guarded the bodies and clothing of Titanic victims.

In 2008, mitochondrial DNA testing by the Armed Forces lab revealed his identity. Sidney Goodwin was the only member of his family whose body has been recovered and subsequently identified. Sidney was born on 9 September 1910 in Melksham, Wiltshire, England. He was the youngest child born to Frederick Joseph and Augusta (n√©e Tyler) Goodwin. Sidney had five older siblings ‚Äì Lillian, Charles, William, Jessie, and Harold. Frederick's brother, Thomas, had already left England and was living in Niagara Falls, New York. Thomas wrote to Frederick, telling him about the opening of a power station there. It has been speculated that the famed Schoellkopf Hydroelectric Power Station (Station A), due to open in 1912, would have been his employer had he lived. Frederick, a compositor, packed up his wife and six children to prepare for the move. They booked third-class passage on the S.S. New York out of Southampton, but due to a coal strike that year the vessel's passage was delayed, and they were transferred to the RMS Titanic. They boarded the Titanic in Southampton as third-class passengers. Not much is known about the Goodwins' activities during the voyage, except that they may have been separated by sex in opposite ends of the ship, Frederick and his older sons in the bow, and Augusta with Sidney and the girls in the stern. Harold also met and spent some time with Frank Goldsmith, who survived. By the time the Goodwins received a warning about the collision with the iceberg, all the lifeboats had been launched. The entire family perished in the sinking. In his book, The Night Lives On, historian Walter Lord devoted a chapter (\\"What Happened to the Goodwins?\\") to the family, using the fact that they were English to challenge the White Star Line's implication that such high numbers of third-class passengers perished because they could not understand the English language. In September, 2020, the Smithsonian Channel aired \\"The Curious Death of a Titanic Child\\", about the identification of Sidney Goodwin as part of The Curious Life and Death of ... series.  Eino Viljami Panula  The erroneously identified child was Eino Viljami Panula (10 March 1911 ‚Äì 15 April 1912). He was a young Finnish boy who died during the sinking of . From 2002 to 2007, he was initially believed to be \\"The Unknown Child\\". Eino was traveling with his mother, Maria Emilia Panula (born Maija Emelia Ketola-Ojala), and four older brothers, Ernesti Arvid (born 18 May 1895), Jaakko Arnold (born 8 February 1897), Juha Niilo (born 1 September 1904), and Urho Abraham (born 25 April 1909). Three other children died before the voyage: Juho Eemeli (23 October 1892 ‚Äì 23 December 1892), Emma Iida (24 February 1901 ‚Äì 8 April 1910) and Lyydia (17 June 1903 ‚Äì 23 December 1903). The family was heading to Coal Center, Pennsylvania, to join their father, Juha. All six members perished in the disaster. Eino Panula's body was never recovered.

Encyclopedia of Jewish Food. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010. Forshmak or \\"appetizer\\" ) is an originally East European dish made of salty minced fish or meat. Different variants of this dish are especially common in Ashkenazi Jewish and Finnish cuisine. Some varieties are also known in Russian and Polish cuisine.  In Jewish cuisine  According to Gil Marks, the German name points to the possible Germanic origin of this dish. William Pokhlyobkin describes it as an originally East Prussian hot appetizer which was made of fried herring.–í. –í. –ü–æ—Ö–ª–µ–±–∫–∏–Ω. –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∫—É—Ö–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, –∏–∑–¥. –ü–∏—â–µ–≤–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–º-—Å—Ç—å, 1980. –ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É—Ö–Ω—è. (William Pokhlyobkin. The Ethnic Cuisines of our Peoples. Moscow, Food Industry publishing house, 1980; Russian) The dish was adopted and brought eastwards by Ashkenazi Jews which transformed it into a cold appetizer, a p√¢t√© made of chopped brined herring. While the name forshmak became common in Ukraine (, ), Polish and Lithuanian Jews usually called it gehakte herring (\\"chopped herring\\"). Traditional recipes include chopped hard-boiled egg, onion and grated fresh apple.Claudia Roden, The Book of Jewish Food, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 62 Sometimes potatoes are also added. The appetizer is usually served as a salad or as a spread on bread, crackers or kichlach (cookies). It may also be eaten for breakfast or as a main course, usually with boiled potatoes.  In Russian cuisine  alt=Four small clay pots covered with grated cheese, served on a table after baking Although nowadays vorschmack is mainly associated with Jewish cuisine in Russia, historically different versions of this dish () were known there. These were usually hot zakuski (appetizers) or breakfast dishes. A Gift to Young Housewives, a classical Russian cookbook by Elena Molokhovets, provides three recipes of hot vorschmack in its first edition (1861) and further variants were added in subsequent editions. In one recipe, meat (veal or beef), herring, white bread and onions are minced, mixed with smetana (sour cream) or cream and baked. Other recipes include only herring (without meat), as well as other ingredients, such as potatoes, eggs and apples. A Gift to Young Housewives, English translation: Even more elaborate recipes with further details on cooking techniques are given in another classical Russian cookery textbook, The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art (1899‚Äì1916) by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva. It was in particular proposed to place the mixture of minced ingredients inside a kalach, cover it with grated cheese and bake it au gratin.

[]  In Polish cuisine  As a cold p√¢t√© or a hot baked appetizer, various recipes of forszmak (the same pronunciation) are found in old Polish cookery. The recipes are similar to the Russian ones described above. Another variety, a meat stew named forszmak lubelski is known in East Poland (Lublin region), usually made of chopped meat (beef, pork, or chicken), pickled cucumbers, and tomato paste.  In Finnish cuisine  alt=A dish of vorschmack garnished with pickles In Finnish cuisine, vorschmack is usually prepared out of ground meat, anchovies or herring and onions. The dish is usually garnished with potatoes, pickles and smetana (sour cream). Snaps is usually served in combination with eating vorschmack. Some recipes include cognac. There are several stories regarding the origin of the dish, but it has become a traditional Finnish dish as it was one of the favourite appetizers of the Finnish fascist statesman, war hero and gourmand Marshall Gustaf Mannerheim. Some sources say Mannerheim brought the dish to Finland from Poland or Russia, but there have not been any definite sources for these claims. The restaurant Savoy at the top floor of one of the buildings around the Esplanadi in central Helsinki is famous for its vorschmack. The restaurant used to be frequented by Mannerheim and Mannerheim's table at the Savoy was always reserved and, out of respect, no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Savoy still today keeps a similar style decor and menu as in the days of Mannerheim.

The period followed the end of the Byzantine iconoclasm and lasted until the fall of the Macedonian dynasty, which ruled the Byzantine Empire from 867 to 1056, having originated in Macedonia in the Balkans. It coincided with the Ottonian Renaissance in Western Europe. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Byzantine Empire's military situation improved, and art and architecture revived. Scenes from the Paris Psalter Painting and mosaic New churches were again commissioned, and the Byzantine church mosaic style became standardised. The best preserved examples are at the Hosios Lukas Monastery in mainland Greece and the Nea Moni Katholikon in the island of Chios. The very freely painted frescos at Castelseprio in Italy are linked by many art historians to the art of Constantinople of the period also. There was a revival of interest in classical Hellenistic styles and subjects, of which the Paris Psalter is an important testimony, and more sophisticated techniques were used to depict human figures. There was also a naturalistic style and more complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art mixed with Christian themes used in art. Sculpture Although monumental sculpture is extremely rare in Byzantine art, the Macedonian period saw the unprecedented flourishing of the art of ivory sculpture. Many ornate ivory triptychs and diptychs survive, with the central panel often representing either deesis (as in the Harbaville Triptych) or the Theotokos (as in a triptych at Luton Hoo, dating from the reign of Nicephorus Phocas). On the other hand, ivory caskets (notably the Veroli Casket from Victoria and Albert Museum) often feature secular motifs true to the Hellenistic tradition, thus testifying to an undercurrent of classical taste in Byzantine art. There are few important surviving buildings from the period. It is presumed that Basil I's votive church of the Theotokos of the Pharos (no longer extant) served as a model for most cross-in-square sanctuaries of the period, including the monastery church of Hosios Lukas in Greece (ca. 1000), the Nea Moni of Chios (a pet project of Constantine IX), and the Daphni Monastery near Athens (ca. 1050).

At the 2002 Keeneland Sales he was purchased by Demi O'Byrne for $3.1-million on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore organization. During his racing career he was owned by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor and was trained at Ballydoyle by Aidan O'Brien. Racing career=2003: two-year- old season One Cool Cat lost on his debut start, finishing 4th in a maiden race at the Curragh. He was soon on the winning trail with a victory in a maiden race at York Racecourse six weeks later. The Anglesey Stakes was his next race, and was the second in a string of four consecutive wins, following up in the Phoenix Stakes and National Stakes. Aidan O'Brien had been so impressed with his work at home and also on the racetrack, that he joked once, \\"I think I'll move him in beside me and knock a door in the bedroom to put him up for the winter!\\" For his performance in the 2003 racing season One Cool Cat was named Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt. 2004: three-year-old season One Cool Cat was sent off favourite for the 2,000 Guineas with new stable jockey Jamie Spencer on board. However, he never struck a blow and finished 13th of 14, over 51 lengths behind the winner Haafhd. It was found afterwards that he had an irregular heartbeat, the likely reason for his poor showing. He was sent out in a Group 3 at the Curragh ten weeks later, odds-on favourite, but again he never threatened over a mile, and finished 5th, 6 lengths behind the winner. A return to 6 furlongs was a victorious one, beating The Kiddykid by a length in the Group 3 Phoenix Sprint Stakes, again at the Curragh, at the start of August. Just eleven days later, he started as favourite for the Group 1 Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse, finishing 3rd, although may well have won with a better run.

Although the Supreme Court split on their definition, the majority advocated tolerating a practice where the individual sincerely feels it is connected to religion, regardless of whether the practice is required by a religious authority. Background The case arose after Mo√Øse Amselem and Ren√© Elhadad, in Montreal erected sukkahs on their balconies in a residential building which they owned. Sukkahs are small dwellings in which Jews live during Sukkot, a Jewish holiday, in accordance with the Hebrew Bible. However, those who managed the buildings, Syndicat Northcrest, claimed the sukkahs violated by-laws forbidding structures to be built on the balconies. The Orthodox Jews had not seen this requirement as applying to religious requirements because Christmas decorations and the like were allowed. Syndicat Northcrest denied all requests that sukkahs be built, except one to be shared but this did not however meet minimal Jewish Halachic requirements. Consequently, an injunction by Syndicat Northcrest was filed against further sukkahs. While there was no government action responsible for violating a right, the Quebec Charter is of relevance to personal disputes. As Justice Michel Bastarache wrote, \\"the first paragraph of s. 9.1 [of the Quebec Charter], insofar as it does not require that the infringement of a right or freedom result from the application of the law, applies only to private law relationships, that is, to infringements of the rights and freedoms of private individuals by other private individuals.\\"Para. 152. Bastarache noted this is what occurred in a previous case, Aubry v √âditions Vice-Versa Inc (1998). Decision The majority decision was written by Justice Frank Iacobucci. He examined whether the by-laws violated the freedom of religion of the Orthodox Jews, and whether Syndicat Northcrest's opposition to the sukkahs was protected by rights to enjoy property under the Quebec Charter. Iacobucci first attempted to define freedom of religion, and started by giving a legal definition for religion. He decided that religion is a thorough set of beliefs regarding a higher power, tied with a person's view of him or herself and his/her needs to realize spiritual completeness.Para. 39. Iacobucci went on to note that in past freedom of religion cases, such as R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd (1985), the Supreme Court has advocated giving freedom of religion a large and liberal definition emphasizing individual rights. In Big M, it was noted there should be respect for religious diversity and no coercion to do something in violation of one's religion.Para. 40. A journal article was then cited to establish this precedent favoured an individual's view of religion to an organized church's.Para. 42. Thus, anyone who claims rights to freedom of religion does not need to demonstrate that they were denied rights to worship in accordance with the manner required by a religious authority. Following R v Edwards Books Ltd and R v Jones, it was enough to demonstrate an individual religious belief.Para. 43-44. These arguments were reinforced by a desire that secular governments and courts should not judge which religious practices are needed and which are not; this was to make legal decisions regarding moral beliefs.Para. 50. Still, practices required by a religious authority are also protected; what matters is that the practice is connected to a religious belief.Para. 47. To determine whether an individual belief is sincere, the Court noted US case law, which advocated a minimally intrusive evaluation of an individual's beliefs. Courts must only determine that a belief is not feigned and religious claims are made in good faith.Para. 52. It must be asked whether an individual's testimony can be believed, and how one belief fits in with others held by the individual. In this, the Supreme Court added that courts should tolerate a change in beliefs; the individual's beliefs held in the past are not relevant to those claimed in the present.Para. 53. The court will determine whether a sufficiently large violation of freedom of religion has occurred to raise challenges under the Quebec and Canadian Charters. The gravity of the violations will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Para. 57-50. However, in this case the Supreme Court noted freedom of religion should not work to deny the rights of others.Para. 62. Turning back to this case, the Supreme Court observed Syndicat Northcrest had argued freedom of religion was limited here by rights to enjoy property and to personal security. However, the Court found the rights of the Orthodox Jews had been severely infringed, while Syndicat Northcrest's rights were not significantly affected. Thus, freedom of religion would prevail. The trial judge had found at least one of the Orthodox Jews sincerely believed he needed a sukkah, while the others seemed not to because they did not have sukkahs in the past. The Supreme Court rejected the latter finding, because it relied on a study of past practice. The Supreme Court also noted the Jews might have wanted sukkahs for religious reasons, regardless of whether they were necessary; this also undermined the view that past practices should be studied. The Court then decided the violation of religious freedom was serious because the right to an individual sukkah was not limited but denied completely.Para. 74. Conversely, Syndicat Northcrest claimed that the sukkahs limited rights to enjoy property because the sukkahs could take away from the attractiveness of the building and its financial value. Rights to personal security were claimed because the sukkahs might block off fire escapes. The Court was unconvinced the property value would drop because of lack of evidence, and the attractiveness of the building for nine days every year was held to be a small issue, especially in the context of the importance of multiculturalism. The Court also noted the Jews had offered to mind fire safety. Regarding the argument that the Jews had waived their rights, Iacobucci noted it was still not certain whether constitutional rights can be waived. If they can, the waiver should be more explicit and done under complete free will. The Jews in this case did not have complete free will in their agreement because they wanted to live in those buildings.Para. 98. Dissent=Bastarache A dissent was written by Justice Bastarache. He interpreted past freedom of religion case law as meaning the right protects religious beliefs and practices that result from those beliefs. Beliefs can be discovered through religious rules; these distinguish religion from personal activities. Thus, a belief is not held individually but is shared. This provided an objective approach to freedom of religion. Expert testimony would be a great help in finding whether a belief is religious. Next, the sincerity of the individual is studied, in a non-intrusive way. Bastarache felt for most of the Jews in this case, the religion required eating in a sukkah, but an individual sukkah was not needed. While Bastarache noted one Jew might have a right to an individual sukkah, this needed to be balanced against \\"proper regard for democratic values, public order and the general well-being of the citizens of Qu√©bec\\", as required by the Quebec Charter. The property and safety rights thus entered consideration. Bastarache wrote that \\"it is difficult to imagine how granting a right of way in emergency situations, which is essential to the safety of all the occupants of the co-owned property, could fail to justify the prohibition against setting up sukkahs, especially in light of the compromise proposed by the respondent.\\"Para. 179. Binnie Justice Ian Binnie also wrote a dissent. He observed the oddness of the situation, namely that a right was being claimed against other owners of the building and not a government. The owners had made agreements that would prohibit the sukkahs. Binnie emphasized the importance of this agreement or contract.

Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Nucleotide synthesis is an anabolic mechanism generally involving the chemical reaction of phosphate, pentose sugar, and a nitrogenous base. Destruction of nucleic acid is a catabolic reaction. Additionally, parts of the nucleotides or nucleobases can be salvaged to recreate new nucleotides. Both synthesis and degradation reactions require enzymes to facilitate the event. Defects or deficiencies in these enzymes can lead to a variety of diseases. Composition of nucleotides, which make up nucleic acids. Synthesis of nucleic acids Nucleotides can be separated into purines and pyrimidines. In the more complex multicellular animals they are both primarily produced in the liver. They both contain a sugar and a phosphate, but have nitrogenous bases that are different sizes. Because of this, the two different groups are synthesized in different ways. However, all nucleotide synthesis requires the use of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) which donates the ribose and phosphate necessary to create a nucleotide. Purine synthesis The origin of atoms that make up purine bases. Adenine and guanine are the two nucleotides classified as purines. In purine synthesis, PRPP is turned into inosine monophosphate, or IMP. Production of IMP from PRPP requires glutamine, glycine, aspartate, and 6 ATP, among other things. IMP is then converted to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) using GTP and aspartate, which is converted into fumarate. While IMP can be directly converted to AMP, synthesis of GMP (guanosine monophosphate) requires an intermediate step, in which NAD+ is used to form the intermediate xanthosine monophosphate, or XMP. XMP is then converted into GMP by using the hydrolysis of 1 ATP and the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. AMP and GMP can then be converted into ATP and GTP, respectively, by kinases that add additional phosphates. ATP stimulates production of GTP, while GTP stimulates production of ATP. This cross regulation keeps the relative amounts of ATP and GTP the same. Excess of either nucleotide could increase the likelihood of DNA mutations, where the wrong purine nucleotide is inserted. Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency in hypoxanthine- guanine phosphoribosyltransferase or HGPRT, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction of producing guanine from GMP. This is a sex-linked congenital defect that causes overproduction of uric acid along with mental retardation, spasticity, and an urge to self-mutilate. Pyrimidine synthesis Uridine-triphosphate (UTP), at left, reacts with glutamine and other chemicals to form cytidine-triphosphate (CTP), on the right. Pyrimidine nucleotides include cytidine, uridine, and thymidine. The synthesis of any pyrimidine nucleotide begins with the formation of uridine. This reaction requires aspartate, glutamine, bicarbonate, and 2 ATP molecules (to provide energy), as well as PRPP which provides the ribose-monophosphate. Unlike in purine synthesis, the sugar/phosphate group from PRPP is not added to the nitrogenous base until towards the end of the process. After uridine- monophosphate is synthesized, it can react with 2 ATP to form uridine- triphosphate or UTP. UTP can be converted to CTP (cytidine-triphosphate) in a reaction catalyzed by CTP synthetase. Thymidine synthesis first requires reduction of the uridine to deoxyuridine (see next section), before the base can be methylated to produce thymidine. ATP, a purine nucleotide, is an activator of pyrimidine synthesis, while CTP, a pyrimidine nucleotide, is an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis. This regulation helps to keep the purine/pyrimidine amounts similar, which is beneficial because equal amounts of purines and pyrimidines are required for DNA synthesis. Deficiencies of enzymes involved in pyrimidine synthesis can lead to the genetic disease Orotic aciduria which causes excessive excretion of orotic acid in the urine. Converting nucleotides to deoxynucleotides Nucleotides are initially made with ribose as the sugar component, which is a feature of RNA. DNA, however, requires deoxyribose, which is missing the 2'-hydroxyl (-OH group) on the ribose. The reaction to remove this -OH is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. This enzyme converts NDPs ( _n_ ucleoside- _d_ i _p_ hosphate) to dNDPs ( _d_ eoxy _n_ ucleoside- _d_ i _p_ hosphate). The nucleotides must be in the diphosphate form for the reaction to occur. In order to synthesize thymidine, a component of DNA which only exists in the deoxy form, uridine is converted to deoxyuridine (by ribonucleotide reductase), and then is methylated by thymidylate synthase to create thymidine. Degradation of nucleic acids General outline of nucleic acid degradation for purines. The breakdown of DNA and RNA is occurring continuously in the cell. Purine and pyrimidine nucleosides can either be degraded to waste products and excreted or can be salvaged as nucleotide components. Pyrimidine catabolism Cytosine and uracil are converted into beta-alanine and later to malonyl-CoA which is needed for fatty acid synthesis, among other things. Thymine, on the other hand, is converted into Œ≤-aminoisobutyric acid which is then used to form methylmalonyl-CoA. The leftover carbon skeletons such as acetyl-CoA and Succinyl-CoA can then be oxidized by the citric acid cycle. Pyrimidine degradation ultimately ends in the formation of ammonium, water, and carbon dioxide. The ammonium can then enter the urea cycle which occurs in the cytosol and the mitochondria of cells. Pyrimidine bases can also be salvaged. For example, the uracil base can be combined with ribose-1-phosphate to create uridine monophosphate or UMP. A similar reaction can also be done with thymine and deoxyribose-1-phosphate. Deficiencies in enzymes involved in pyrimidine catabolism can lead to diseases such as Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency which has negative neurological effects. Purine catabolism Purine degradation takes place mainly in the liver of humans and requires an assortment of enzymes to degrade purines to uric acid. First, the nucleotide will lose its phosphate through 5'-nucleotidase. The nucleoside, adenosine, is then deaminated and hydrolyzed to form hypoxanthine via adenosine deaminase and nucleosidase respectively. Hypoxanthine is then oxidized to form xanthine and then uric acid through the action of xanthine oxidase. The other purine nucleoside, guanosine, is cleaved to form guanine. Guanine is then deaminated via guanine deaminase to form xanthine which is then converted to uric acid. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the degradation of both purines. Uric acid is then excreted from the body in different forms depending on the animal. Free purine and pyrimidine bases that are released into the cell are typically transported intercellularly across membranes and salvaged to create more nucleotides via nucleotide salvage. For example, adenine + PRPP --> AMP + PPi. This reaction requires the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Free guanine is salvaged in the same way except it requires hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Defects in purine catabolism can result in a variety of diseases including gout, which stems from an accumulation of uric acid crystals in various joints, and adenosine deaminase deficiency, which causes immunodeficiency. Interconversion of nucleotides Once the nucleotides are synthesized they can exchange phosphates among one another in order to create mono-, di-, and tri-phosphate molecules. The conversion of a nucleoside-diphosphate (NDP) to a nucleoside-triphosphate (NTP) is catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, which uses ATP as the phosphate donor. Similarly, nucleoside-monophosphate kinase carries out the phosphorylation of nucleside-monophosphates. Adenylate kinase is a specific nucleoside- monophosphate kinase that functions only on adenosine-monophosphate.

It was originally named Cassiope hypnoides by Linnaeus (1737) in his Flora Lapponica, but Harrimanella hypnoides is now the accepted name at Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The species name hypnoides means 'like Hypnum ', which is a genus mosses. The plant is a cold hardy dicot perennial found growing on rock crevices in the Canadian arctic, Quebec, the Northeastern United States, Greenland, Iceland, the mountains of Norway, Sweden and Finland, Svalbard and arctic Russia, including the Ural mountains. Harrimanella hypnoides produces moss-like cushions, about 5 cm high, often of prostrate stems with ascending shoot tips. The leaves are scale-like, looking like those of a moss. The flowers are conspicuous, white and bell shaped with five fused petals and five sepals. They are borne singly on short reddish pedicels. The fruit is an erect capsule.

In specific terms, Geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase 1) adds a 20-carbon isoprenoid called a geranylgeranyl group to proteins bearing a CaaX motif: a four-amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminal of a protein. Geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors are being investigated as anti-cancer agents.  Function  Prenyltransferases, including geranylgeranyltransferase, posttranslationally modify proteins by adding an isoprenoid lipid called a prenyl group to the carboxyl terminus of the target protein. This process, called prenylation, causes prenylated proteins to become membrane-associated due to the hydrophobic nature of the prenyl group. Most prenylated proteins are involved in cellular signaling, wherein membrane association is critical for function.  Structure  Geranylgeranyltransferase contains two subunits, Œ± and Œ≤ that are encoded by the FNTA and PGGT1B genes, respectively. Both subunits are composed primarily of alpha helices. Geranylgeranyltransferase coordinates a zinc cation on its Œ≤ subunit at the lip of the active site. Geranylgeranyltransferase has a hydrophobic binding pocket for geranylgeranyl diphosphate, the lipid donor molecule. All Geranylgeranyltransferase substrates invariably have a cysteine as their fourth-to-last residue. This cysteine, coordinated by the zinc, engages in an SN2 type attack on the geranylgeranyl diphosphate, displacing the diphosphate.

Sprague de Camp, the seventh book of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and the fifth of its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. Chronologically it is the third Krishna novel. It was first published in hardcover by Berkley/Putnam in 1977, and in paperback by Berkley Books in 1978. A new paperback edition was published by Ace Books in 1982 as part of the standard edition of the Krishna novels. An e-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition The novel has also been translated into German and Czech. The Hostage of Zir was de Camp's first Krishna novel in a quarter century, the previous one (The Tower of Zanid) having been written in 1952 and published in 1958. As with all of the \\"Krishna\\" novels, the title of The Hostage of Zir has a \\"Z\\" in it, a practice de Camp claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna.  Plot and storyline  Tour guide Fergus Reith arrives on the backward world of Krishna with a gaggle of tourists, the first such group to visit the planet. Though he is woefully unprepared and his charges collectively epitomize the \\"Ugly Terran\\" stereotype, he readies for his task as best he can and squires his flock off on their grand circuit of the northern Varastou nations among which the Terran spaceport of Novorecife is situated. The first portion of the novel is an episodic account of their misadventures cruising down the Pichide River, in the Free City of Majbur, and the island kingdom of Zamba. The next few stops, including a visit to the republic of Katai-Jhogorai, are passed over summarily; the real action begins when the group reaches Baianch, capital of the northern kingdom of Dur. There, while taking the new railway to the end of the line, the party is kidnapped by Barr√© vas-Sarf, bandit ruler of the restive province of Zir. Barr√© hopes to use them as bargaining chips in his dispute with Tashian bad-Garin, prince-regent of Dur. Reith escapes, only to be captured in turn by the forces of Shosti, the Witch of Zir. Shosti is Barr√©'s rival for control of Zir and the leader of a local religious cult; her designs on Reith are quite different, as her prophecies lead her to believe she must mate with a red-haired Terran to engender a savior god. A previous captive, Felix Borel (protagonist of the earlier Krishna short story \\"Perpetual Motion\\"), had been executed after failing to impregnate Shosti. Reith reads his own fate in Borel's, knowing Terrans and Krishnans are not interfertile ‚Äì the latter, while near human in appearance, are an alien species. Once more he succeeds in escaping, subsequently leading a raid to free his tourists from Barr√©. Apparently safe back in Baianch, Reith relates his adventures to Tashian, with unfortunate results. The account of Terran- Krishnan biological incompatibility inspires the crafty prince-regent to trick Reith into an intimate encounter with V√°sni bad-Dushta'en, Princess of Dur, and then marry her off to him by force. The continuation of Tashian's regency is dependent on V√°sni producing no legitimate male offspring, a lack her marriage to Reith will ensure. Separated again from his tourists, Reith grimly sets about planning yet another escape. This he achieves thanks to a fortuitous diplomatic visit to Baianch by Pandr (prince) Ferrian bad-Arjanaq of the island nation of Sotasp√©, whom Reith had previously encountered in Zamba. (Ferrian was the protagonist of the earlier Krishna short story \\"Finished\\".) Finally winning back to Novorecife, Reith learns his tour group has returned before him, and most have left the planet. He resolves to depart as well, but reconsiders when the guide of the second tour group to reach Krishna suffers an accident, leaving an opening for an experienced guide... Fergus Reith would go on to become the main recurring character in the Krishna series, reappearing in a minor role in The Prisoner of Zhamanak, and as the protagonist of The Bones of Zora and The Swords of Zinjaban.  Setting  The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, December 1959, page 3.) As dated in James Cambias's GURPS Planet Krishna (a 1997 gaming guide to the Viagens series authorized by de Camp), the action of The Hostage of Zir takes place in the year 2145 AD., falling between The Hand of Zei and The Prisoner of Zhamanak, and making it the seventh story set on Krishna in terms of chronology. Cambias's dating may be too early, however, as internal evidence in Zhamanak indicates that it occurs shortly after Hostage, while internal evidence in The Bones of Zora indicates that it occurs shortly after Zhamanak, with the events of \\"The Virgin of Zesh\\" happening between. As \\"Virgin\\" is securely dated to 2150, this could shift the dating of Hostage and Zhamanak as late as 2148 and 2149, respectively. Reception Publishers Weekly calls the book a \\"cheerfully bloody and bawdy adventure, which will strike home to anyone who's experienced conducted travel.\\"\\"Science Fiction. The Hostage of Zir\\" (review). In Publishers' Weekly, v. 212, no. 18, October 31, 1977, p. 51. Rosemary Herbert, writing for Library Journal, is less enchanted: \\"The book is lively at times, particularly when Reith is forced to marry an alien, but for the most part it reads like a traveler's nightmare, full of stereotyped characters, unsympathetically portrayed.\\"Herbert, Rosemary. \\"Science Fiction. De Camp, L. Sprague. The Hostage of Zir\\" (review). In Library Journal, v. 103, no. 1, January 1, 1978, p. 106. Lester del Rey in Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact has no such complaints, proclaiming \\"[t]here's only one way to describe [the book]; it's a new Krishna novel. And like de Camp's other popular Krishna novels, it's a wry and wacky story of a human forced to contend with the semicivilized and semihuman cultures of an alien world where Murphy's law always holds good, and nothing ever goes according to plan. You could call it sword-and-sorcery, since swords are buckled with a touch of swash, and human science is a sort of magic to the too-human but egg-laying Krishnans. But the adventure is always cock-eyed.\\" He concludes that \\"[i]f you've read and enjoyed the other stories of Krishna, you'll want this one. If you haven't read any, this is a good one to start with.\\"Del Rey, Lester. \\"The Reference Library.\\" In Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, v. 98, no. 1, January 1978, p. 173. William Mattathias Robins takes a middle tone: \\"[d]e Camp's travelers are a misfit crew of oversexed, silly, selfish, xenophobic outlanders. Reith, however, is an appealing young man who is literally transformed from an introvert to a composed, even heroic, leader. Most of the action is seen through his eyes, so the reader shares in his growth, and the novel proves successful.\\"Robins, William Mattathias. \\"The Hostage of Zir\\" (review).

He was the 1984 Democratic Party nominee for the U.S. Congress seat in Connecticut's fourth district, and briefly challenged Senator Joseph Lieberman for the 2006 Democratic Senate nomination. As of 2007, Orman was one of two people claiming to be the current chairman of the Connecticut for Lieberman Party. He was born in Brazil, Indiana.  1984 Congressional Race  Orman was the Democratic candidate for U.S. Representative from the Fourth Congressional District in 1984 against the popular incumbent Republican Stewart McKinney. He said he saw it as an opportunity to discuss national issues and represent a progressive constituency. After losing the election, he welcomed Rep. McKinney to his classroom to meet with his students.  2006 Senate campaign  In March 2005, Orman announced that he would challenge Lieberman for the Democratic nomination, saying Lieberman was disloyal to the Democratic party and supported the foreign policy of President George W. Bush. Orman's campaign generated support from bloggers across the country, but for a variety of reasons, he was never considered a serious threat to Lieberman. In September 2005, he announced he was withdrawing from the race because of a lack of money. The end of Orman's campaign was followed by the campaign of businessman Ned Lamont. When Lamont came to Fairfield University in the spring of 2006, he told those in attendance that he was \\"picking up where John Orman left off.\\" Lamont went on to upset Lieberman in the Democratic primary in August, winning the party's nomination for the Senate seat with 52% of the vote, but lost the general election to Lieberman, who ran on the Connecticut for Lieberman party line.  Connecticut for Lieberman Chairmanship  On November 15, 2006, Orman changed his party registration from \\"Democratic\\" to \\"Connecticut for Lieberman\\" and submitted \\"party rules\\" to the office of the Secretary of the State. Some of the new rules Orman adopted for the Connecticut for Lieberman party included:\\"Orman Elected New Chair of Connecticut for Lieberman Party\\" , Press Release, November 16, 2006, by John Orman, retrieved on 2007-03-12 On January 3, 2007, Connecticut Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz accepted a filing from Orman. Ted Bromely, a state elections attorney who worked for her office, said \\"If someone wanted to challenge it, they'd have to go to court.\\" On June 12, 2007, Orman called for Lieberman to resign from the Senate, describing the senator's rhetoric regarding military action against Iran as \\"unilateral warmongering\\" that could lead to \\"World War III\\". Orman called for Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell to appoint Susan Henshaw as Lieberman's replacement.  Other activities  A member of the Fairfield University faculty from 1978 until his death, Dr. Orman was a former Teacher of the Year and was serving as chair of the Department of Politics at the time of his death. Orman was the author of four books on American politics. One of his books, \\"Celebrity Politics,\\" gained national attention and was published in 2003 with Brown University Professor Darrell West. He was also the faculty adviser to the Fairfield University men's basketball team, and a frequent participant in stand-up comedy and hip-hop contests. As a member of the Politics Department, he was instrumental in the hiring of several faculty members, including helping to recruit David L. Downie from Columbia University.He was frequently written about in a number of local publications, including The Fairfield Mirror.

The episode was written by Joy Lusco from a story by David Simon & Joy Lusco and was directed by Tim Van Patten. It originally aired on November 7, 2004.  Plot  Omar visits Butchie to discuss Bunk's lecture about the loss of morality in their neighborhood. Butchie dismisses it as a ploy by Bunk, but Omar cannot put his conscience to rest. He locates Dozerman's weapon, which Butchie hands to Bunk. Elsewhere, Carcetti questions Burrell and verifies that Mayor Royce has not acted on his request to look into the death of the state's witness. D'Agostino convinces Carcetti to meet with Royce again, and hold off on attacking him for any continued inaction until a time closer to the mayoral primaries. Carcetti approaches Royce a second time to discuss changes to the way the city protects witnesses, but the mayor claims there is no money available. Carcetti types a letter of concern while Royce and Burrell hold a press conference on the return of Dozerman's weapon. In the Western, Slim Charles tells Avon that Marlo has withdrawn his operation from all of his corners; Avon orders him to take the corners as soon as the police watching them leave. As they drive away, Herc, one of the officers surveilling Avon, recognizes him. Colvin discusses his statistics with Lieutenant Mello and the Western's community relations sergeant, which show that crime is up near Hamsterdam but down in the rest of the district. Mello thinks the bosses should know that what they are doing is working, but Colvin insists that it should be kept a secret for the time being, to make sure the numbers are sustainable. In Hamsterdam, Bubbles finds the area overwhelmingly chaotic and hellish, even by what he has experienced before. He learns that addicts living there need basic supplies to get by. Bubbles spots Johnny, who refuses to leave. A fight breaks out and the uniformed officers break it up. Herc and Colicchio refuse to help Sergeant Carver as he assists in the Hamsterdam experiment. When Carver remarks that there are too many children, Colicchio notes that many of them are now unemployed because lookouts and runners are not needed if trade is legal. Carver tells the dealers that they have to pay one hundred dollars a week to deal in Hamsterdam, with the money going towards supporting the children. Carver uses the first of the cash to buy a basketball hoop for the children. Colvin visits Hamsterdam that night, at which point the basketball hoop has already been destroyed. Meanwhile, Marlo tells Partlow they are going to step back and wholesale their package to other dealers and let Avon take their corners. Marlo hopes to bide his time to catch Avon unaware. Bernard purchases batches of disposable phones for Shamrock, sticking to Bell's rules by buying only two phones from any single outlet. His girlfriend, Squeak, complains about the time-consuming errands and wants to buy the phones in bulk. Squeak eventually convinces Bernard by offering him oral sex in exchange. Elsewhere, Donette tells Bell that Brianna is planning to visit the police station to talk to McNulty about D'Angelo's death. An angered Bell learns that Brianna has been in contact with Levy, who recommends that they tell Avon. Bell says he will handle it. Meanwhile, Slim Charles assigns Poot to one of Marlo's corners with some muscle for protection. Poot is worried about retaliation from Marlo. Later, Snoop kills one of Poot's men in a drive-by shooting. At the Major Crimes Unit, Daniels reports that Bell and Marlo are the unit's new targets. He calls McNulty into his office, accurately suspecting he used Colvin to force the unit's change in direction. An unapologetic McNulty defends his actions, upon which Daniels tells him that he will be out of the unit once Bell is arrested. Freamon and Prez analyze the phone that Bubbles procured, but the information is difficult to interpret without knowing more about Marlo's organization. Freamon comments that a phone from the Barksdale organization would allow them to map out the organization with everything that they already know but it would be difficult to get a wiretap up with the phones being disposed of so quickly. McNulty, Greggs, and Sydnor restart their surveillance work, waiting for Bodie to dump a phone. McNulty convinces them to share a drink with him, causing them to narrowly miss Avon's meeting with Bodie. When Greggs comes home drunk, an argument ensues with Cheryl, who asks her to leave. The next morning, Shamrock phones Bodie and Puddin and recommends that they relocate to Hamsterdam. On their way to the zone, their SUV is stopped by McNulty and Greggs. McNulty covertly swaps out Bodie's phone for a similar model, while Bodie and the dealers angrily mention Hamsterdam several times. After being called to assist McNulty and Greggs, Carver is forced to tell them what Hamsterdam is. Colvin arrives to explain his plan to the unit, asking them to keep it secret. They return to the detail, Greggs asks Massey if she can stay at her place for a while, while Prez reports the information he found on D'Agostino to McNulty. Using the information, McNulty dons a suit and attends a Washington fundraiser, where he runs into her and arranges another one night stand. The following day, McNulty arrives late and finds Pearlman and Daniels receiving a briefing on Freamon and Prez, who have identified a communication network with fifteen distinct phone users by analyzing call patterns. They have identified a coordinator who acts as a nexus for communications. The detectives have also found that the phones are pre-programmed with the numbers before being put into use. Freamon asks Greggs to have the Western DEU squad collect phones for them. Greggs and McNulty meet with Herc and Carver and ask them to collect any stray burners they find. Herc tells them that he saw Avon driving around the neighborhood, which McNulty and Greggs both refuse to believe. Upon returning to the office, they check Avon's status on the computer and, along with Daniels, are outraged when they find he has been paroled. Meanwhile, having left the game for good, Cutty reapplies himself to the casual landscaping job he was working before. The crew boss convinces him to return to the Deacon, to whom Cutty discusses his state of mind. He says he is tired of doing things he doesn't want to do and wants to change, and asks the Deacon to call him Dennis.  Production = Title reference  The title refers to the disposable cell phones used by the Barksdale organization. The idiom \\"put on the back burner\\" refers to making something less of a priority, or switch focus to something else. The drug dealer Williamson is put on the back burner as Bell and Stanfield are made the new targets and arresting Bodie's crew becomes less important than the Hamsterdam cops-dealers pact. The title can also refer to the \\"back door\\" move made on Lieutenant Daniels by Detective McNulty in getting the investigative targets changed.  Epigraph  Butchie uses this phrase when talking to Omar about his problems with Bunk over the death of Tosha.

Founded in 2001, the Capitals play their home games in Vienna, Austria, at Albert Schultz Eishalle. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, the Capitals claimed their first Austrian Championship in defeating EC KAC. History The Vienna Capitals were founded in 2001, after the disbandment of Wiener EV in 2000, to continue the legacy of ice hockey which has been present in the federal capital since 1914. They began competition into the EBEL in the 2001‚Äì02 season, under coach Kurt Harand. With good performances they established themselves in mid-table and finished the end of the regular season in fourth place. In the quarterfinals the Capitals swept the Graz 99ers 4: 0 before losing in a sweep to EHC Linz in the semifinals. In their fourth year of competition and with Jim Boni now the head coach after the disappointment of the previous seasons and a revised squad, the Capitals claimed their first Austrian title in the 2003‚Äì04 season. Behind the acquisition of goaltender Fr√©d√©ric Chabot, the team managed to form a tight-knit unit and ended the regular season top of the league with eight points ahead of the runner-up, the EC KAC. In the semifinals, the Capitals defeated EC VSV in four games and met EC KAC in the final. The first six games of the final series were won by the respective away team, before Vienna won the seventh game 6-2 for their first league title in their history, and the first Viennese club to win in 43 years. Logo of the Capitals from 2001 to 2011. In the following seasons, the Capitals made repeat semi-finals appearances; however, in more recent years the Capitals would suffer from a lack of developing prospects compared to other Bundesliga teams. This was due to the fact that Vienna did not offer a consistent training facility, and team affiliate, EHC Vienna, ceasing its partnership. Beginning in the 2007-08 season, the league enforced a scheme that allowed each EBEL team the commitment of only five transfer card players; as a substitute the so-called points rule was introduced. With the Capitals handcuffed by the lack of available talent Capitals president Hans Schmid tried abolishing the points rule in order to freely acquire players in the future. This sparked heated discussions among the clubs, where it was argued according to the EU labor rules that every hockey player should be allowed free choice of employment, of which any regulations would be illegal. In preparation for the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Capitals competed in the 2011 European Trophy for the first time in franchise history. They would win just 1 game out of 8 to finish last in their division. Venue The home games of the Capitals were played to crowds of up to 4,500 spectators at the comprehensive Albert Schultz Eishalle in Vienna's Danube City. In February 2009 it was announced that the capacity of the hall would be expanded to 7,000 spectators with a retractable roof. Renovation work began after the 2008‚Äì09 season and was completed before the 2010‚Äì11 season to the cost of 40 million euros. In addition to increasing seating capacity, a parking garage was built and new video screens and VIP boxes were installed. The Capitals have been the EBEL's best drawing club in attendance, pulling in an average of 4,800 over the years.

The club play their home games at the Eisarena Salzburg. History The history of ice hockey in Salzburg at the highest level dates back to 1977‚Äì78, when the then HC Salzburg took a sensational third place in the first division. Influential players such as Rick Cunningham and Roger Lamoureux (both Canadians) helped to massively increase the popularity of Salzburg ice hockey, and in December 1977 saw the ice rink sold out for the first time. Ten years later in 1988, the Salzburg ice hockey club, now known as Salzburg EC, were once again on course for the title. With strong players such as the Russians Viktor Schalimow and Sergej Kapustin or fine-sounding names such as Greg Holst from Canada or Vienna's Peter Znenahlik, an exciting winter in the \\"Volksgarten\\" could be expected. After a strong season which included spell at the top in the preliminary round standings, Salzburg failed to take its first Bundesliga championship, and its ailing economic situation eventually saw the relegation of SEC from the first division. EC Salzburg were founded in 1995 by the merger of two small clubs EC Morzg and EC Tiefenbach. The EC Morzg originally arose after the bankruptcy of Salzburg EC in 1988 as a refuge for the youth players. Shortly after the foundation, the company Kaindl presented the club with its first major sponsor and the club was renamed to Kaindl EC Salzburg. From the beginning of 2000, drinks manufacturer Red Bull became the team's major sponsor and the club again changed names to represent EC The Red Bulls Salzburg. It was later transitioned to EC Red Bull Salzburg in 2005. 2000‚Äì04 Strengthened by players such as Canadian Sheldon Moser and Brian McCarthy of the USA, the Red Bulls became champions of the Oberliga as quickly as the 2000‚Äì01 season (the Oberliga was then the equivalent of the second division), but weren't quite yet ready for the highest level. Until three years later, that is. The Red Bulls fought their way back to the championship in the Nationalliga, ending the Salzburg ice hockey club's 16 years of absence from the Bundesliga. 2004‚Äì06 After increasing the squad intensively - in Austria's ice hockey history, the Salzburg ice hockey club first competed in the Nationalliga with a farm team - the Red Bulls had to learn the hard way in the first Bundesliga season of \\"recent times\\", although they did show their potential. Following seventh and last place in the preliminary rounds of the season which saw them promoted, team formation enjoyed an ever more professional environment, and in the second year following promotion, the Red Bulls found themselves in the final of the Erste Bank ice hockey league. In the end, however, they lost to VSV, taking the runner-up spot in the sixth game of the best-of-seven series. 2006‚Äì07 Salzburg were finally rewarded in their third 1st division season. After a fabulous regular season contested by eight teams, where the Red Bulls conceded just one out of 28 home games, Salzburg went on to put in a sterling performance in the play-offs as well. Following three successive victories over the Vienna Capitals in the semi- final (best of five), the Red Bulls conceded just one game in the final against VSV in Villach, sealing Salzburg's first ever Austrian ice hockey championship with a score of 4:1 on wins (best of seven). The finals games in Villach, where VSV were backed by an incredibly enthusiastic crowd, their seventh man, were particularly tough. The secret of their success was consistency, the team having been perfectly prepped by head coach Hardy Nilsson. The 59-year-old Swede subsequently retired from active coaching, celebrating the Red Bulls' title and his tenth championship as a coach. 2007‚Äì08 For their fourth 1st division season, the Red Bulls were joined in Salzburg by new head coach and sporting director Pierre Pag√© as well as a number of new international coaches. In addition to non-playing staff, future captain Stuart Mercer was drafted into the side after a home video being seen on YouTube of him demonstrating 'Phil Harrison-esque tekkers' at Hutton Grammar School. On 25 September 2007, in preparation for the new season, Red Bull played an exhibition match against National Hockey League team, the Los Angeles Kings, losing in an entertaining 7-6 contest. In his first few months, the 59-year-old Canadian helped set up the International Ice Hockey Development Model (IIDM), laying the foundations for the development of up- and-coming junior players, and also took the unprecedented step of heavily integrating young players into the 1st division squad. After a regular season full of ups and downs the Red Bulls began the newly introduced intermediate round in third place, then going on to drop another place. But there was no stopping Salzburg in the play-offs: after an exhausting best-of-five series in the quarter final against Villach, they left the Vienna Capitals standing in the semi-final, where they racked up four wins (best of seven). The final against Slovenian club Olimpija Ljubljana became a real thriller, which ended with the Red Bulls 4:2 ahead on wins after proving better able to hold their nerve. Salzburg therefore managed to bag the title for the second year running, the farm team's second place in the √ñsterreichische Nationalliga also underlining a strong performance. 2008‚Äì09 The 2008‚Äì09 season saw the Red Bulls narrowly miss out on retaining their title. After an incredibly exciting finals series spanning seven games, they suffered a narrow 1-2 defeat in the final game in Klagenfurt, losing their crown to KAC. The Red Bulls nevertheless end the season with their heads held high, having played some fast-paced and powerful ice hockey with by far the youngest team in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga and impressed an ever-increasing number of Salzburg fans, who made sure the play-off games were always a sell-out. In the second year of his tenure as head coach and sporting director, Pierre Pag√© made an even bigger impression than last year: his skill for bringing a number of young, talented players from Austria and abroad together with some of Austria's strongest players - captain Thomas Koch was awarded MVP honours this season - produced a force to be reckoned with as the season progressed, the team having started the championship with an average age of just 23.8. In the context of the Red Bull Hockey Model several talented farm team players were also given their chance in the 1st division, some of them even holding their own in the finals series. The Red Bulls fielded a total of 43 players in the 1st division. The farm team, which largely comprised U-20 players this year, was knocked out in the quarter-final of the √ñsterreichische Nationalliga by EK Zell am See. 2009‚Äì10 The 2009‚Äì10 season puts all others in the shade. In his third year with the Red Bulls, head coach and sporting director Pierre Pag√© single-mindedly pursued his objectives and now the Salzburg ice hockey club has picked up no fewer than three championship titles! In September 2009 the Red Bulls won their own invitation tournament, the Red Bulls Salute, for the first time in its five-year history, beating top-flight European clubs such as CSKA Moscow in the process. In November 2009 and January 2010, Salzburg took part in their third Continental Cup, Europe's most prestigious IIHF club tournament of the season, also lifting the cup after two successful rounds in Latvia and France. The Red Bulls made it an incredible hat trick by winning the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, celebrating their most successful season so far in their ten-year existence as a club. Thomas Koch, who takes the 2009 MVP award, lifted the cup for the first time as captain. Sterling work with the juniors as part of the Red Bull Hockey Model was rewarded with, among other things, the U-20 and U-17 championships. The Red Bulls' farm team was knocked out in the semi-finals of the √ñsterreichische Nationalliga (2nd division) by Dornbirn, who went on to take championship honours, but continued to provide several young talented players with the ideal platform from which to develop. Record breakers: On 12 January 2010, the Red Bulls took on Jesenice in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, fielding a line-up whose average age was just 21.1 years. Overall, 47 Salzburg players made at least one appearance in Austria's premier division.

They play their home games at Stadthalle (capacity approximately 4500 spectators) in Villach, Austria. The team colors are blue and white. Their mascot is an eagle - Villach's coat of arms represents an eagle's claw.  History By winning the second divisions title in the 1976‚Äì77 season EC VSV gained automatic promotion to Austria's highest league and has tenured since. Following rival team, EC KAC, Villacher is the second oldest club in the EBEL. Although the team finished last in their debut season at the top level (a primary reason why head coach Karol Havasi was replaced by player-coach Ryan D'Arcy by the end of the season), some of their young players, led by Leo Sivec, already showed good promise. In their second season they took the fifth place, the main problem was the vacant coaching job, which was initially filled by Adalbert and Saint John, by the end of the season by injured Bart Crashley. After missing the playoffs three times in a row, in the 1980‚Äì81 season, Villach finally achieved their league title success. Thanks to the youth training under Hermann Knoll and an increased incorporation of the young players (Sivec the oldest residents at that time was just 23 years of age) the EC VSV finished the regular season up to second place. The Final round against the Wiener EV was won narrowly. The following year, however behind Sivec missed presence due to injury most of the season, Villach finished 5th in both the regular season and playoffs. EC VSV in Zagreb During the last decade of the 20th century EC VSV established themselves as a competitive outfit claiming two early Austrian Championships in 1992 and 1993, in a period when VEU Feldkirch dominated the action in the Austrian Hockey. After struggling against local rivals EC KAC in the playoffs. it was not until the 1998‚Äì99 season in which Villach could get past Klagenfurt in the finals again and win their fourth title. Villacher secured its last title success, it sixth, in the 2005‚Äì06 , under coach Greg Holst. They won the title after a dominant regular season, alongside EC Red Bull Salzburg. The two teams met each other in the finals as expected with VSV earning 4: 2 series win. A large influence in helping VSV earn the 2006 title were due to Dany Bousquet, who led the club and league in points with 47 goals and 86 points. His greatest success of the season was certainly the decisive goal in the deciding final match against Salzburg in overtime. Goalkeeper Gert Prohaska finished with a save percentage of 92.85%, a clear margin from second place in the league. In the following season, on 20 February 2007 marked the end of the longest winning streak at 17 between Villach and rivals KAC in the Carinthian Hockey derby. EC KAC had not recorded a win in almost two years over their rivals.

It transfers (usually) two geranylgeranyl groups to the cystein(s) at the C-terminus of Rab proteins. :geranylgeranyl diphosphate + protein-cysteine \\\\rightleftharpoons S-geranylgeranyl-Cys-protein + diphosphate The C-terminus of Rab proteins varies in length and sequence and is referred to as hypervariable. Thus Rab proteins do not have a consensus sequence, such as the CAAX box, which the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase can recognise. Instead Rab proteins are bound by the Rab escort protein (REP) over a more conserved region of the Rab protein and then presented to the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase. Once Rab proteins are prenylated, the lipid anchor(s) ensure that Rabs are no longer soluble. REP therefore plays an important role in binding and solubilising the geranylgeranyl groups and delivers the Rab protein to the relevant cell membrane.  Reaction  Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase; enzyme commission code EC 2.5.1.60) is classified as a transferase enzyme; specifically, it is in the protein prenyltransferase family along with two other enzymes (protein farnesyltransferase and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type-I). The reaction catalyzed by RabGGTase is summarized as follows: * geranylgeranyl diphosphate + protein-cysteine = S-geranylgeranyl-protein + diphosphate This reaction is essential in the control of membrane docking and fusion. Studies of mice have shown that Rab GGTase genes are expressed in all major adult organs, as well as in some embryonic units, including the spinal cord and liver (Chinpaisal). Rab geranylgeranyltransferase‚Äôs ‚Äúoutsourcing‚Äù of specificity (using REP to interact with the Rab proteins it prenylates, as mentioned above) is unique among prenyltransferases. Rab GGTase is ‚Äúresponsible for the largest number of individual protein prenylation events in the cell,‚Äù probably due to this ability to interact with many different Rab proteins (it can prenylate any sequence containing a cysteine residue). In vitro studies have shown that Rab GGTase can be inhibited by nitrogen- containing bisphosphonate drugs such as risedronate; however, the effects of such drugs seem to be much more limited in vivo (Coxon).  Structure  Crystallographic structure of rat RabGGTase (alpha subunit = green, beta subunit = slate blue, calcium ions are shown as green balls, zinc ion as a blue ball). RabGGTase is a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits that are encoded by the RABGGTA and RABGGTB genes, respectively. The structure of rat RabGGTase has been determined by X-ray diffraction (see image to the left) to a resolution of 1.80 √Ö.; RabGGTase‚Äôs secondary structure is largely composed of alpha helices; the alpha subunit is 74% helical with no beta sheets, while the beta subunit is 51% helical and 5% beta sheet. There are 28 alpha helices total (15 in the alpha subunit and 13 in the beta subunit) and 15 very short (no more than 4 residues) beta sheets. Functional RabGGTase binds three metal ions as ligands: two calcium ions (Ca2+) and a zinc ion (Zn2+), all of which interact with the beta subunit.

One of the most famous of Thurber's humorous modern fables, it first appeared in The New Yorker on October 21, 1939; and was first collected in his book Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated (Harper and Brothers, 1940). The fable has since been reprinted in The Thurber Carnival (Harper and Brothers, 1945), James Thurber: Writings and Drawings (The Library of America, 1996, ), The Oxford Book of Modern Fairy Tales, and other publications. It is taught in literature and rhetoric courses. Plot summary A husband sees a unicorn in the family garden and tells his wife about it. She ridicules him, telling him \\"the unicorn is a mythical beast\\" and calls him a \\"booby\\". When he persists, she threatens to send him to the \\"booby hatch\\" (the mental institution). He persists, and she summons the authorities. However, after she tells them what her husband saw and they note her own somewhat loony-looking facial features, they force her into a straitjacket. They then ask the husband if he told his wife he had seen a unicorn. Not wanting to be locked up himself, he prudently tells them that he has not, because \\"the unicorn is a mythical beast.\\" Thus they take the wife away instead, and \\"the husband lived happily ever after\\". The story ends with, \\"Moral: Don't count your boobies before they're hatched\\", a play on the popular adage, \\"Don't count your chickens before they're hatched\\". Thus, the moral advises not to expect one's hopes to be a certainty. In popular culture=Adaptations An animated version of the story was released by United Productions of America in 1953. The cartoon was directed by William Hurtz, and was originally intended to be part of a feature based on Thurber's work, to be called Men, Women and Dogs. In 1994, it was voted #48 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. The fable was also adapted to the stage as part of the 1960 revue A Thurber Carnival. The original cast for this portion of the stage production was as follows: *Paul Ford - Man *Alice Ghostley - She *John McGiver - Psychiatrist *Peter Turgeon - Narrator *Charles Braswell - Policeman The fable was animated again as part of the My World and Welcome to It episode \\"The Night the House Caught Fire\\", which first aired October 13, 1969. In the episode, William Windom as John Monroe tells the story to his daughter Lydia (Lisa Gerritsen) as his accompanying drawings come to life for the viewer. The episode was written and directed by series creator Melville Shavelson. The animation for the series was by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. Also in 1969, a musical adaptation of \\"The Unicorn in the Garden\\", composed by Russell Smith, was performed by the Denver Lyric Opera in Denver. In a 1985 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Johnny mentions the story and tells sidekick Ed McMahon the plot. An audio adaptation of the story, read by Peter Ustinov, was released by Caedmon Audio in 1986 (). Allusions The 1950 film Harvey contains a scene depicting characters at a psychiatrist's office, where Veta is committed to the institution instead of Elwood. Dr. Richard Lenski, leader of the E. coli long-term evolution experiment, made an allusion to the story in a widely disseminated responsehttp://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/06/lenski-gives-co.html Reference at the notable Panda's Thumb blog to Conservapedia founder Andrew Schlafly (who expressed doubt Lenski found an evolutionary beneficial mutation in E. coli bacteria): \\"In other words, it's not that we claim to have glimpsed 'a unicorn in the garden' ‚Äì we have a whole population of them living in my lab!\\" The ninth episode of the TV series Life on Mars has similarities with the story. The protagonist, Detective Inspector Sam Tyler tells a criminal that he, Tyler, is a time traveller from the future. When the criminal tells Tyler's colleagues of this, in an attempt to discredit him, Tyler denies being the source of the 'delusion' and the criminal is discredited instead. \\"The Sloths\\", a song by Red Krayola, has been described as \\"a peculiar rewrite of a James Thurber short story (The Unicorn in the Garden)\\".http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=red_crayola In the short fiction piece \\"Scrabble with God\\" by John M.

There have been claims that Yoshida was a member of the Kokuryukai, Amur River Society (also known as the Black Dragon Society), an ultra-nationalist organization of disenfranchised ex-samurai who promulgated \\"pan-Asiatic ascendancy\\" in line with the rise of Japanese imperialism. Others have asserted that he was a member of the Genyosha (the \\"Dark Ocean Society'), a previous organization founded by Toyama Mitsuru. However, the membership roles of both of these organizations are meticulously documented, and Yoshida's name does not show up in the registry of either the Genyosha or the Kokuryukai. Therefore, although it is quite likely that Yoshida had right-wing, nationalist leanings, he was not a significant figure in the major nationalist organizations of the late Meiji and Taisho periods. While by all accounts a prolific martial artist and teacher, there is little surviving documentation of Yoshida's life that has been translated into English. Because he was known to have lived an extremely ascetic lifestyle, and possibly as a result of his political activities and connections, most information on Yoshida today has been passed down through oral transmission by primary sources. At a young age, Yoshida apprenticed himself to Takeda S≈çkaku, head of the Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki-j≈´jutsu school, which would soon become popular throughout Japan as part of the public revitalization of the martial arts.

The episode was first broadcast on February 19, 2003, on UPN. It is a sequel to the original series episode \\"It's a Good Life\\". Bill Mumy and Cloris Leachman reprise their roles from the original episode. Anthony Fremont's daughter, Audrey, is played by actor Bill Mumy's real life daughter Liliana Mumy. It was written by Ira Steven Behr (based on characters created by Jerome Bixby), and directed by Allan Kroeker.  Opening narration Plot Anthony Fremont has been terrorizing the residents of the small town of Peaksville for 40 years, still using his psychokinetic powers to banish those he deems \\"bad\\", including his own wife and father, to a mythical \\"cornfield\\". His mother Agnes is shocked to discover that Anthony's beloved young daughter Audrey has inherited those powers. This discovery is soon followed by one even more shocking: Audrey can bring back things that her father has banished to the cornfield. With this realization, Agnes - who has grown to detest her son - tries to influence her granddaughter to use her powers in order to free Peaksville from Anthony's reign of terror. When Anthony learns of his mother's plans he seeks out each co-conspirator one by one, sending them to the cornfield. Agnes finally confronts her son, letting go of all of the dismay, hatred and anger that she has suppressed for forty years, and tries to convince Audrey to use her powers against her own father and wish Anthony away. Audrey is forced to choose between her grandmother and her father, whom she loves very much. Caught between these two sides, Audrey ultimately aligns herself with her father, saving him from a resident who attempted to hit him while his back was turned. But then to the horror of Anthony she sends her grandmother away and empties the town of Peaksville. Anthony and Audrey are left alone, but Anthony soon realizes that he misses having everyone else around. In order to cheer her father up, Audrey brings back the world beyond Peaksville, which Anthony had sent away decades prior. Audrey asks Anthony about visiting New York City, and her father replies that it is a big city with many people. Audrey implies that they had all better be nice to her and her father, otherwise they'll suffer severe consequences. The episode ends with Anthony realizing that his daughter is far more powerful than he is, and he accepts that she has done a \\"real good thing\\" by returning the world outside of Peaksville. As a couple pulls up to ask them if they know how to get to Highway 10, Anthony and Audrey plan to travel to different places. Anthony states that \\"It's going to be a good day.

The park and the Robert W. Ryerss Museum and Library was a gift of the last descendant of the Ryerss family, prominent Philadelphians. Robert W. Ryerss died on Feb. 18, 1895 at age 65, leaving his estate to Mary Reed, his wife of eight months and the head housekeeper of the Ryerss Mansion for 27 years. He left everything to her on the condition that upon her death the best part of his land and much of his estate would be left to the ‚ÄúPeople of Philadelphia, forever‚Äù as a museum and public lending library. Mary Reed Ryerss spent the rest of her life traveling around the world collecting objects for the museum and planning for the library and park. History of the estate The Ryerss Mansion was built in 1859 by Joseph Waln Ryerss, a wealthy importer of goods from Asia and president of the Tioga Railroad, to be the family's summer home. The Waln family, who intermarried frequently with the Ryerss family, were descendants of Nicholas Waln, who sailed on the Lamb in 1682, the same year as William Penn. The Waln and Ryerss families were among Philadelphia's social elite. The Ryerss family The Ryerss family were philanthropists and early animal rights activists. Robert‚Äôs stepmother, Anne Ryerss, would care for elderly and sick work horses on the Burholme estate. When she died in 1888, she left $30,000 to care for \\"aged and infirmed\\" horses and an additional $40,000 to create and maintain a hospital. Robert W. Ryerss bought an farm in Bustleton and became the first president of the Ryerss Farm for Aged Equines until he retired in September 1894. The facility was among the first in the United States to protect horses and large animals. Today the Ryerss Farm for Aged Equines still exists in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Robert W. Ryerss was instrumental in helping create the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals and the Anti- Vivisectionist Society of Pennsylvania. Visitors to the museum can see the family‚Äôs pet cemetery and the many portraits the Ryerss commissioned of their pets. When Joseph W. Ryerss died in 1868 he left the estate to his only son Robert W. Ryerss. Robert was educated at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, but because of the family‚Äôs wealth, he was able to live a life of leisure, while using much of his inheritance for philanthropic purposes. He traveled around the world and collected objects to display in the home. He was also an avid reader. On his death he left his library of 11,000 books to be used as a public library. The Ryerss Public Library was one of the first public libraries in the city. On May 14, 1910 Burholme Park and the Ryerss Museum and Library opened to the public. The Park Burholme Park provides fields for sports organizations. There are three baseball diamonds, a football field, and three soccer fields. The Park also contains a playground and is a popular place for sledding on the park's large hill. The park is situated next to Jeanes Hospital and Fox Chase Cancer Center, as well as a Mini-golf/Driving Range. Fox Chase Cancer Center announced on January 16, 2010 that it was abandoning its efforts to expand into the park. The center decided not to appeal a Commonwealth Court decision against its plans. In December 2008, Judge John W. Herron ruled that Fox Chase was not entitled to build on of the park. The hospital had appealed that decision to Commonwealth Court. The Woods at Burholme One of the more noteworthy features of Burholme Park is its beautiful wooded areas, holding the park true to its name, which means \\"house in a woodland setting.\\" These woods also serve as a haven for underage drinking, which is heavily targeted by suburban police.

In 1844, he was offered but refused the positions of Solicitor General of Canada and then Attorney-General for Canada East - the latter position he turned down again in 1847. In 1887, he was one of the two English-speaking candidates considered by the Liberals for the role of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. The home he commissioned and lived in at Montreal from 1845 to 1849 still stands today, known as the Notman House. Early life Born May 23, 1812, at No.1 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, second son of the Rev. Thomas Meredith and his wife Elizabeth Maria Graves (1792‚Äì1855), the eldest daughter of the Very Rev. Richard Graves, Dean of Ardagh.William Collis Meredith He was named for his father's first cousin, William Collis (1788‚Äì1866) J.P., of Tieraclea House, High Sheriff of Kerry, a first cousin of Lord Monteagle. Meredith was a nephew of Robert James Graves and a brother of Edmund Allen Meredith. His first cousins included John Walsingham Cooke Meredith, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, John Dawson Mayne, Francis Brinkley, Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell and Sir James Creed Meredith. A year after Meredith was born his family moved up to Ardtrea, near Cookstown, County Tyrone, his father having resigned his fellowship in Dublin to take up the position of Rector there. In 1819, Meredith's father died of 'a sudden and awful visitation' at his home while attempting to shoot a ghost with a silver bullet. His mother returned to Harcourt Street, Dublin, and he joined his Meredith and Redmond cousins at Dr Behan's school in County Wexford. Five years later, against her parents wishes, Meredith's mother remarried her mother's cousin, James Edmund Burton (1776‚Äì1850), a first cousin of Henry Peard Driscoll and an uncle of Sir Richard Francis Burton and Lady Stisted. Formerly a magistrate at Tuam, Meredith's step-father had \\"wasted every farthing of his Irish property\\" and so attracted by the land grants he took the position of the Church of England's first missionary to Terrebonne, Quebec. In the summer of 1824, Meredith arrived at 'Burtonville', his stepfather's house and farm outside Rawdon, Quebec, then a four-day journey north of Montreal. He was tutored there by Burton himself or by whatever tutor his stepfather could procure, who were few and far between. In 1828, William's mother, \\"a lady of much culture and refinement, and possessed also of great energy and force of character\\", sent him back to Ireland to complete his studies at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1831, a year before his mother and stepfather returned permanently to Cloyne, Co. Cork, he chose to return to Montreal to commence his legal studies there. He articled under The Hon. Clement-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury and then James Charles Grant, QC, before being called to the Bar of Lower Canada in 1836. Duel and Rebellion The Battle of Saint-Eustache, 1837, at which Meredith fought as a Lieutenant with the Montreal Rifles. The Notman House in Montreal, was commissioned by Meredith when a 31-year-old bachelor. It was completed to the design of John Wells in 1845 and was Meredith's home until 1849. On Monday, August 9, 1837, at eight o'clock in the evening, Meredith fought a duel with pistols against James Scott, no stranger to such events. Earlier that day, following a dispute over legal costs, Meredith challenged Scott. He chose James McGill Blackwood (son of John Blackwood) to second him, while Scott's choice was Joseph-Ferreol Pelletier. The duel took place behind Mount Royal, and the pistols used were Meredith's which he had bought in London, on a previous trip to England. On the first exchange Scott took a bullet high up in the thigh, and the duel was called to a stop. List of duels Meredith v Scott, 1837, under 'Canadian Duels'. The bullet in Scott's thigh bone lodged itself in such a way that it could not be removed by doctors, causing him great discomfort for the rest of his days. Ironically for Scott, this was exactly where he had shot Sweeney Campbell in a duel when they were students. In the early 1850s (Scott died in 1852), when both the adversaries had become judges, one of the sights then to see was Meredith helping his brother judge up the steep Court House steps, Scott being still hindered by the lameness in his leg since their encounter. Not long after the duel, his career was interrupted again by the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. Under the command of Lt.-Colonel Cl√©ment-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury, with whom he had articled with a few years previously, Meredith joined the Montreal Rifles as a Lieutenant and saw action against the French rebels at the Battle of Saint-Eustache, reaching the rank of Major in the militia. Montreal From the late 1830s Meredith, \\"a careful, shrewd lawyer\\", was senior partner of the firm Meredith & Bethune (a relation through the explorer Alexander Henry the elder) and subsequently Meredith, Bethune & Dunkin. Their offices were situated at 33 Little St. James Street and the firm was described in the 1840s as the most influential in Montreal, having brought together the largest legal business by any one firm in the Province of Quebec. In 1843, he commissioned John Wells, to build him a home beyond the walls of Old Montreal on a spacious plot of land surrounded by fields, Elm and Maple trees. It still stands today, known as the Notman House. In 1844, he was created a Queen's Counsel (Q.C.), declining the office of Solicitor General, and subsequently that of Attorney-General, which he declined again for the second time in 1847 during the Draper administration. Meredith disliked politics. In the same year Chief Justice Joseph-R√©mi Valli√®res de Saint-R√©al offered him the position of Dean of Law at McGill University, which he also turned down - a position his grandson, William Campbell James Meredith, later held. He was one of the founding members and a director of the High School of Montreal, which was established with his help in 1843 and soon superseded the Royal Grammar School. He was counsel to the board of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning and on the committee to save McGill University in the early 1840s. He conducted a good deal of business for the university, and it was with his influence that his younger brother, Edmund Allen Meredith, became the sixth principal of McGill from 1846 to 1853. In 1848, he was a founding director and trustee of the Montreal Mining Company along with Peter McGill, George Moffatt, Sir George Simpson, Sir Allan Napier MacNab and James Ferrier. Quebec In December 1849, Meredith was appointed to be one of the first ten judges of the newly established Superior Court for the Province of Quebec, by the Lafontaine‚ÄìBaldwin government, a position he held for ten years. However, this meant abandoning with some reluctance the practice of a profession to which he was greatly attached, and in doing so relinquished a profitable business in Montreal. During Lord Elgin's term as Governor General of Canada (1847‚Äì1854), Meredith was elected one of the judges of the Seigneurial Court. In 1859, 'at the earnest solicitation of the government and in compliance with the members of the Montreal bar', he accepted a seat from Sir George-√âtienne Cartier, as a judge in the Court of Queen's Bench, that being the Court of Appeals for the province. Several of his judgments were spoken of very highly by the lords of the Privy Council in England. He filled the position for seven years 'with marked ability and success'. On December 28, 1854, he was given an honorary D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Bishop's University College, Lennoxville. In 1880, he received the honor for a second time, from Universit√© Laval. In 1865, at a private meeting of the board of governors of Bishop's University he was unanimously elected to become the university's new Chancellor, but due to his existing official duties he declined the position. His youngest son, Frederick Edmund Meredith, would hold the position from 1926 to 1932. Meredith's friend Sir John Abbott, who had studied law under him and later became Prime Minister of Canada, was a reluctant supporter of Canadian Confederation in 1866. Abbott feared that it would reduce the English-speaking inhabitants of Lower Canada to political impotence. Among others, he consulted with Meredith and Meredith's former business partner, Christopher Dunkin. They drafted a resolution calling on the government to protect the electoral borders of twelve English Quebec constituencies. Subsequently, Alexander Tilloch Galt endorsed the proposal, had the London Conference of 1866 accept it, and included it as Article 80 of the British North America Act, 1867. In 1866, following the death of one of Meredith's closest friends, Edward Bowen, Sir George-√âtienne Cartier appointed him Chief Justice of the Superior Court for the Province of Quebec. Judge Caron rivalled him for the position, but the influential and affable D'Arcy McGee (then Minister of Agriculture), a close associate of Meredith's brother (Edmund Allen Meredith), made a few favourable representations on Meredith's behalf, easing the way for his appointment to the position. In the years before his retirement he was the oldest judge on the Bench in Canada, 'still going with his characteristic energy and ability'. Chief Justice Meredith finally retired for health reasons, in this his final office, October 1, 1884. The government did their best to keep him from resigning his post, but Meredith declined their offers to accept leave of absence with the understanding that his full salary would be paid and his resignation subsequently accepted. Two years later he was created a Knight Bachelor by Queen Victoria. Meredith had been as popular among the French as he was among the English, which was extremely rare for the time. This is made clear from an article written in the French journal L'Electeur at his retirement, La retraite de M. le juge Meredith va creer un vif chagrin dans le barreau comme parmi le public. Jamais en effet un magistrat ne sut mieux se concilier leftie des avocats sans cesse en rapport avec lui et la confiance du public. Jurisconsulte eminent, magistrat dont la reputation d'honorabilite a toujours ete au-dessus du soupcon, bienveillent pour tout la monde, d'un politesse vraiment exquise, M. le juge en chef va laisser une vide bien difficile a remplir. In 1887, on the retirement of Louis-Rodrigue Masson as Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Liberal government favoured an English-speaking replacement. Along with his wife's cousin, George Irvine, Meredith was named as one of the two men, who if appointed, would bring the greatest satisfaction to the English-speaking minority. Neither Meredith nor Irvine were appointed, the new government instead choosing another French-speaking Quebecer, Sir Auguste-R√©al Angers. At Meredith's death in 1894, the Legal News printed: The late Chief Justice was a diligent advocate and judge, and conscientious and painstaking in the performance of every duty. The opinions delivered by him from the bench have always been cited with the greatest respect and many of them are models of what a judicial opinion should be. They excel in clearness, are ample without ceasing to be concise, and bring light and satisfaction to the reader. Family Sophia Naters (Holmes) Meredith William Collis Meredith was married at Christ Church Cathedral, Montreal, May 20, 1847, to Sophia Naters Holmes (1820‚Äì1898). She was the eldest daughter of the late 'well-known and popular' William Edward Holmes (1796‚Äì1825), a Quebec surgeon (son of William Holmes) and a brother-in-law of Sydney Robert Bellingham. Mrs Meredith's mother, Ann Johnston (1788‚Äì1865), was the daughter of Lt.-Colonel James Johnston and his wife Margaret, sister of John MacNider. Mrs Meredith was one of seven siblings and half-siblings, but other than her only two were married: Her brother, William Holmes, married a daughter of Colonel Bartholomew Gugy, and their half-sister, Eliza Paul, married Major Stephen Heward (1776‚Äì1828), brother-in-law of Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto. The Merediths were the parents of ten children: *Sophia Elizabeth Meredith (1848‚Äì1927), married Henry Nicholas (Monck) Middleton (1845‚Äì1928) J.P., D.L., of Dissington Hall, Northumberland, and later Lowood House, near Melrose, Scotland. He was a brother of Sir Arthur Middleton, 7th Baronet, of Belsay Hall. Their son married a daughter of Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey. *William Henry Meredith (1849‚Äì1895), director of the Bank of Montreal. He died at a comparatively young age, unmarried, at the apartments he kept in the Windsor Hotel (Montreal). *Matilda Anne Meredith (1851‚Äì1875), died young, unmarried, at Cannes, France. *Edward Graves Meredith (1852‚Äì1938) N.P., of Quebec, married Isabella Agnes Housman (1858‚Äì1949), daughter of The Rev. George Vernon Housman (1820‚Äì1887), for 25 years Rector of Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral, Quebec City, by his wife Eliza Izza Maria Reeves (1823‚Äì1865) of Hanover Square, London. George Housman was the uncle of the poet A.E. Housman and the grandson of Thomas Shrawley Vernon of Hanbury Hall. *Harriet Meredith (1854‚Äì1941), married Harry Stanley Smith (1850‚Äì1916), a native of Seaforth near Liverpool, who retired to Addington House, Wimbledon. *Hylda Graves Meredith (1856‚Äì1931), married George Hamilton Thomson (1857‚Äì1929), grandson of George Hamilton. * Richard Holmes Meredith (1858‚Äì1868), died young. *Louisa Meredith (1860‚Äì1938), married her half first cousin Lt.-Col. Edward Hampden Turner Heward (1852‚Äì1930). His brother married the sister of Lord Atholstan. *Frederick Edmund Meredith (1862‚Äì1941) K.C., D.C.L., of Montreal, married Anne Madeleine VanKoughnet (1863‚Äì1945), granddaughter of Colonel Philip VanKoughnet. They were the parents of William Campbell James Meredith. *Evaline Bertha Meredith (1863‚Äì1868), died young. Private life William Meredith at his home in Quebec City. The bust in the corner is of his uncle, Richard MacDonnell On moving from their house in Montreal to Quebec City in 1849, the Merediths lived at 19 St. Ursule Street, a large, three storey, brick house with room for five live-in servants. In Christmas 1853, they entertained the author William Henry Giles Kingston and his new wife, Agnes Kinloch. In 1866, they built a summer house, 'Rosecliff' in the hamlet of St. Patrick, outside Rivi√®re-du-Loup (where they owned of farmland), which is still occupied by his descendants today. In Quebec City, they owned three further houses and two barn stables; keeping five pleasure carriages, sleighs, two wagon-sleds, three horses and one milk cow. When he became financially independent in 1830, Meredith had purchased four town lots in Kent County, Upper Canada, that turned out to be an important investment in consequence of the railway that was built there. Frances (known as Feo) Monck was the maternal granddaughter of Henry Monck, 1st Earl of Rathdowne and the sister-in-law of the then Governor-General Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck. 'Not generally given to benevolence in her judgments,' she gave an unusually long account of a party - or 'drum' as it was known - given by Judge Meredith in her book, My Canadian Leaves, An Account of a Visit to Canada, 1864‚Äì1865: Dick (her husband, Lt-General Richard Monck) and I, and Captain Pem. (Sir Wykeham Leigh Pemberton) are going, I hope, to-night to a 'drum' at Judge Meredith's.... There was a very large party, and the house is large. I was much amused and talked to many people, among others to M. Duvergier-d'Hauranne, a young Frenchman, who is come over here to travel, and has brought a letter to the Governor-General from Lord Clarendon. His father (Prosper Duvergier de Hauranne) was a well-known man in France under Louis Philippe I. My friend, Sir R.M. (Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, William's first cousin who spent a year in Canada as Governor of Nova Scotia in 1864) rushed to me, and asked me to walk about with him, and invited us to Government House (Nova Scotia) at H. (Halifax), which he told me was much finer and larger than 'Spencer's Wood'. Lady M (Lady Blanche MacDonnell) and Dick flirted together for a long time; she is so pretty and pleasant. A Miss Tilstone sang‚Äîa handsome girl with a pretty voice. Then a Madame Taschereau (a daughter of Robert Unwin Harwood) sang‚Äîgood voice; and then THE man sang, Mr Antoine Chartier de Lotbini√®re Harwood (brother of Madame Taschereau) an M.P.P., half French. He has a very fine voice, and is a pupil of Garcia's. He was offered an engagement at the Italian Opera, London. The large rooms were too small for his voice, which wants modulation. I got quite giddy with the loudness of it ! He sang from operas; he wants expression and more teaching. Judge Meredith introduced him to me, and he sang again, for me ! Meredith frequently returned to Europe, either touring the continent with members of his family or visiting friends and relatives in Ireland. Rather than their stepfather, he and the rest of his siblings regarded their uncle, Rev. Dr Richard MacDonnell, as a second father. In 1853, Edmund Allen Meredith wrote in his diary that 'the doctor (as they referred to MacDonnell) spoke much of the splendid apples and cider William had sent him'. In return 'the doctor' insisted on opening bottle after bottle of claret for Edmund, 'to prove to William that it is now possible to find good claret in Ireland!' Obituaries Chief Justice Meredith was 'a gentleman with exemplary charm and manners', and 'a man of fine scholarly attainments'. He possessed 'troops' of friends and was 'held in the highest respect in the City and Province of Quebec, by all classes of the community' and even more extraordinary for the time, was described as being as popular among the French as the English. This is noticeably apparent in an article written about him in L'Opinion Publique on 10 July 1879 : Le Juge-en-Chef est l'urbanite meme, il est attentive comme un Francais de l'ancien regime. A cette grande affabilite qui n'est nulle part plus appreciable que sur le banc d'un tribunal. Le Juge Meredith joint un savoir etendu, un tact parfait, un judgement tres sur. Il voit au fond s'egarent, les avocats qui brouillent les faits, aux elements fondamentaux dont il faut s'inspirer pour retrouver la verite. Tout cela avec infiniment de benevolence et toutes les formes de la politesse. 'Esteemed for his high character, wide knowledge and amiable disposition', 'his lofty conception of duty, his great learning, and his gentleness of character commanded the admiration and affection of the bench and bar of Quebec.' Sir William Colles Meredith died , aged eighty two after a short illness, and he was buried with many of his family at Mount Hermon Cemetery, Sillery. Part of the inscription on his gravestone reads, ' ... Thoughtful consideration for others marked all his acts and made bright his daily walk through life.'

The episode first aired on the UPN network on April 24, 1995. It was directed by Les Landau and written by former Star Trek: The Next Generation story editor Naren Shankar. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation. In this episode, after a sample of a protostar is brought on board, crewmen start to vanish from a holodeck simulation of Beowulf. The Doctor (Robert Picardo), a hologram, investigates and finds that a lifeform was transported to the ship alongside the sample. It escaped to the holodeck where it was converting those who entered into energy. The Doctor has the samples brought to the holodeck and released, resulting in the lifeform returning the crewmen to their corporeal states. With this episode, Shankar sought to move the Doctor out of sickbay, and while he was looking generally to involve Vikings on the holodeck, it wasn't until later that he realized he had inadvertently followed the story of the Beowulf poem, and so changed the script to include direct references. Composer Dennis McCarthy sought to increase the tempo of the music used in this episode, and included an unused piece written for The Next Generation episode \\"Qpid\\"; he was nominated for Outstanding Music Composition at the Emmy Awards for his work on \\"Heroes and Demons\\". A further nomination at those awards was received by Marvin V. Rush for Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series. Picardo's performance was praised by the crew, and the episode was received positively by critics, who compared elements to The Lord of the Rings and computer based roleplaying games. It received Nielsen ratings of 6.4/11 percent. Plot The crew encounters a protostar and Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) decides to have samples beamed aboard for use as a potential power source. A problem occurs when beaming the samples to Voyager. Janeway recommends to B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) that she should have Ensign Harry Kim's (Garrett Wang) assistance, but he is discovered to be missing. The crew finds his holodeck program, based on the epic poem Beowulf, still running. With each person sent into the holodeck also becoming lost, Captain Janeway sends in the Doctor (Robert Picardo) to investigate, under the assumption that as an immaterial hologram, he cannot be dematerialized in the way the missing crew had been. The Doctor shows signs of nervousness when preparing for his first \\"away\\" mission, so Kes (Jennifer Lien) encourages him to take a name to embolden him with having an identity of his own. He states that he has narrowed his choices to three but does not reveal them. Once in the holodeck, the Doctor meets Freya (Marjorie Monaghan), a shieldmaiden, and introduces himself as \\"Schweitzer\\". She takes him to the hall, where he is made to prove himself before the others, and after a celebratory meal and everyone has retired to separate rooms, she reappears and suggests that, in the cold of the night when the fire in his hearth has gone out, he ought to join her. Though he dismisses her advances, he relaxes his inhibition in later scenes. Later they are confronted by Unferth (Christopher Neame), who kills Freya. She dies in Schweitzer's arms. With her last words she speaks his name. As the Doctor investigates, he realizes that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the containment field into which the protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to energy by the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned to their original forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful. Production=Writing Naren Shankar had worked on Star Trek: The Next Generation before writing \\"Heroes and Demons\\" Rick Berman, Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller had worked together as executive producers for the pilot of Voyager, \\"Caretaker\\", and the following ten episodes. \\"Heroes and Demons\\" was the first episode where Piller wasn't involved in the writing of the scripts because he had begun work on the series Legend. Instead, the episode was written by Naren Shankar, the former story editor for Star Trek: The Next Generation during the final two seasons of the show where he worked with Berman, Taylor and Piller. Following the end of The Next Generation, Shankar had pitched a number of spec scripts for a variety of television series including The Simpsons, but \\"Heroes and Demons\\" was the first one he sold, which was accepted before Voyager had begun production. The initial idea for the episode had come from a conversation between Shankar and Brannon Braga over dinner in which they sought to move the Doctor from sickbay into the holodeck, marking this episode as the first one in which the Doctor had left sickbay. Shankar had originally intended the story to be \\"Star Trek with Vikings\\", and it wasn't until he was sketching out the plot of the episode that he realised that he had inadvertently created something similar to the Beowulf poem. He deliberately worked direct references in the poem into the script for the episode, such as specific lines and the attack on the mead hall.Brooks (2015): p. 82 His significant change from Beowulf was the addition of the character, Freya. The script went through two drafting stages, with the main issue being the alien element rather than the Viking details. Shankar was pleased that the work he did on the Viking parts of the script went unchanged from the first draft to the screen, calling it his \\"best experience\\" as a writer. He also chose the first name that the Doctor would attempt to use, selecting Albert Schweitzer from a list of scientists and doctors because he thought the surname sounded funny. He expected that it would be cut or changed, based on his experience in writing humorous elements into scripts for The Next Generation. He wrote several lighthearted scenes into the script and was pleased when none of them were cut, saying that he was particularly proud of the exchange between the Doctor and Freya where she says \\"Your people must value you highly\\", and the Doctor responds dryly, \\"You would think so.\\" He submitted his final version of the script on February 2, 1995. Taylor later talked about the use of the holodeck as a plot device in this episode, saying that it allowed the series to show things that otherwise couldn't happen on the show. She added that the plot in this episode \\"transcended the idea of 'Oh, we're in trouble on the holodeck.'\\" Guest stars, set design and musical composition Guest star Christopher Neame had previously appeared on The Next Generation in the seventh season episode \\"Sub Rosa\\". After his performance in \\"Heroes and Demons\\", he would go on to appear in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine sixth season episode \\"Statistical Probabilities\\".Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 514 Marjorie Monaghan later appeared in Babylon 5 in the recurring role of Number One/Theresa Halloran from the episode \\"Lines of Communication\\" onwards.Killick (1998): p. 100 During the filming of \\"Heroes and Demons\\", Monaghan's stunt double was Patricia Tallman. The duo went on to work together on Babylon 5 with Tallman playing the character of Lyta Alexander. They didn't initially recognise each other on the later show because of the costumes they wore in the Voyager episode. Monaghan was also considered for the main cast part of T'Pol in Star Trek: Enterprise. The forest set was constructed on stage 12 at the Paramount Studios lot, and was designed by production designer Richard James. Backdrops were used to expand the depth of the stage. Marvin V. Rush later explained that they were not aiming for a real world forest look to the scenes, as the story allowed them to aim for something in the \\"in mythology and in historical record\\" instead. He attributed this for why the scenery design and creation was successful. Director Les Landau also found that it enabled him to use some different camera angles in \\"Heroes and Demons\\", including shooting from a crane and the use of close-focus lenses to enable some wide shooting to get a sense of depth. Composer Dennis McCarthy had worked on the Star Trek franchise since the pilot episode of The Next Generation, and has included such work as the music for the film Star Trek Generations and the theme to Deep Space Nine. \\"Heroes and Demons\\" was significant for McCarthy, as he had sought to increase the tempo of the music he created over the course of several years with the addition of further percussion instruments. He had one piece which was written for The Next Generation episode \\"Qpid\\" which he wanted to use but had never managed to include it in an episode. This was finally used in \\"Heroes and Demons\\", and he submitted that work for consideration at the Emmy Awards. Reception=Ratings \\"Heroes and Demons\\" was first broadcast on April 24, 1995, on the UPN network. According to the Nielsen ratings, it received a 6.4/11 share, meaning it was watched by 6.4 percent of all households and 11 percent of all households watching television at the time of broadcast. This placed it as the 74th highest rated broadcast of the week across all networks. At the time of broadcast, this was the lowest rated episode of the series so far but received the same ratings as the following episode \\"Cathexis\\" and higher than the final two episodes, \\"Jetrel\\" and \\"Learning Curve\\". Cast and crew response Several members of the crew praised the work of Robert Picardo in \\"Heroes and Demons\\". Writer Naren Shankar was happy with the overall episode, saying \\"I think all the Viking scenes worked very well. The sets were magnificent-the forest set was beautiful, and I don't really have any complaints about it. Everybody really outdid themselves on it.\\" Supervising producer David Livingston praised the prop and wardrobe departments for creating the array of \\"cool-looking\\" extras, while Michael Piller said that the whole episode was \\"well produced\\". Taylor praised the premise, calling the idea \\"irresistible\\" and the overall episode \\"delightful\\". Members of the crew praised the work of Robert Picardo on this episode, with Taylor saying that he was \\"wonderful\\" in \\"Heroes and Demons\\", while Piller saw the character as a \\"fish out of water\\" and added that \\"Picardo is a wonderful actor.\\" Kenneth Biller, executive story editor, felt that the episode gave Picardo a \\"chance to shine\\",Gross & Altman (1996): pp. 143 ‚Äì 144 and that the episode was \\"a lot of fun\\". Picardo himself was pleased with the episode, later describing it as his favourite of the first season. Garrett Wang also added that he was happy with the episode, as being an Asian-American actor he didn't otherwise get a great deal of chances to appear in period work, and he enjoyed the wardrobe he wore. Critical response In his chapter, \\"From Anglo-Saxon to Angelina: Adapting Beowulf for Film\\", in Medieval Afterlives in Contemporary Culture, Stewart Brooks compared \\"Heroes and Demons\\" to the Beowulf story. He said that certain elements of the episode were more similar to the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons instead of historical fact, such as the character of Freya who he also compared to √âowyn from J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. He praised the episode, saying that the \\"real pleasures\\" were \\"to witness the surly, introverted, neurotic Doctor being forced to play the hero, banter with Vikings and have his first romantic liaison when Freya falls for him.\\"Brooks (2015): p. 83 In 2011, Brian J. Robb also linked the episode to roleplaying games in his article on the episode for Star Trek Monthly, suggesting that the repetition of some scenes may have been influenced by the increase in popularity of computer based roleplaying games at the time of production. Edward L. Risden described \\"Heroes and Demons\\" as \\"Pulp TV tackles mead-hall ritual\\" in his book, co-authored with Nickolas Haydock, Beowulf on Film: Adaptations and Variations. He added that it gave the Beowulf story \\"a new twist adaptive to science fiction and to audiences who want human interest even in electronic projections.\\"Haydock & Risden (2013): p. 168 Michelle Erica Green, while reviewing the episode for TrekToday, said that the plot was \\"pretty superficial\\" and the science was \\"pretty nonsensical\\". But she said that it was a \\"delightful outing for the Doctor\\" and demonstrated the potential for the character. Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, called the plot a \\"lame-brained exercise in the obvious\\", but praised the performance of Picardo and the drama within the holodeck. He described McCarthy's score as \\"ambitious\\", and added that the production design was \\"convincing\\" providing an added bonus to the episode. Marvin V. Rush was nominated for Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series at the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards for his work in this episode, but the award went to Tim Suhrstedt for his work on \\"Over the Rainbow\\", an episode of Chicago Hope. At the same ceremony, Dennis McCarthy was also nominated for an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Music Composition for his work on \\"Heroes and Demons\\".Ruditis (2003): p. 476 Home media release The first home media release of \\"Heroes and Demons\\" was on VHS cassette in the UK. The releases featured two episodes per tape, with this episode appearing alongside \\"State of Flux\\" in 1995. It was subsequently released by itself on VHS in the United States July 11, 2000. The first DVD release was also in the UK, as part of the first season box set on May 3, 2004. A similar release followed in the United States on February 24, 2004, and a re-release occurred in the UK on September 24, 2007.

Background and state of Pars  Pars (also known as Persis), a region in the southwestern Iranian plateau, was the homeland of a southwestern branch of the Iranian peoples, the Persians. It also was also the birthplace of the first Iranian Empire, the Achaemenids. The region served as the center of the empire until its conquest by the Macedonian king Alexander the Great (). Since the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, Pars was ruled by local dynasts subject to the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. These dynasts held the ancient Persian title of frataraka (\\"leader, governor, forerunner\\"), which is also attested in the Achaemenid-era. Later under the frataraka Wadfradad II (fl. 138 BC) was made a vassal of the Iranian Parthian (Arsacid) Empire. The frataraka were shortly afterwards replaced by the Kings of Persis, most likely at the accession of the Arsacid monarch Phraates II (). Unlike the fratarakas, the Kings of Persis used the title of shah (\\"king\\"), and laid foundations to a new dynasty, which may be labelled the Darayanids. Origins= New Persian and Arabic texts  Map of Pars There are various different sources regarding the relationship between Pabag, Sasan, and the first Sasanian monarch Ardashir I (). According to the Shahnameh (\\"The Book of Kings\\") by the medieval Persian poet Ferdowsi (d. 1020), Sasan was a descendant of the mythological Kayanian rulers Dara II, Dara I, Kay Bahman, Esfandiyar and Vishtaspa. The claim of Sasan belonging to the Kayanian family was designed in order to justify that Ardashir was descended from the ancient Kayanian kings, who reflected memories of the Achaemenids. Dara II, the last Kayanian king to rule before Alexander, is partly based on the last Achaemenid King of Kings, Darius III (), whose empire was indeed conquered by Alexander's forces. A son of Dara II, named Sasan (called \\"the elder\\") fled to India and lived there in exile until his death. He was survived by a son who was likewise named Sasan (called \\"the younger\\"), \\"which continued in the family for four generations\\". A descendant of the family, likewise named Sasan, worked for Pabag, who was a local ruler in Pars. Pabag's daughter married Sasan, and bore him a son named Ardashir. Following this, Sasan is no longer mentioned. The Shahnameh thus indicates that the ancestors of Sasan resided in India following Alexander's conquests. This report has been used by scholars to point out Sasan's Indo-Parthian connection. According to the medieval Iranian historian al-Tabari (d. 923), Pabag was the son of Sasan and a princess named Rambihisht, who was from the Bazrangid family, a dynasty of petty rulers in Pars. He presents Pabag as the father of Ardashir. Like Ferdowsi in his Shahnameh, al-Tabari also describes Sasan as a foreigner in Pars, however, unlike him, he does not mention Sasan's place of origins.  Middle Persian texts  The Middle Persian text Kar- Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan (\\"Book of the Deeds of Ardashir, son of Pabag\\"), says the following regarding the ancestry of Ardashir: ardax≈°ƒ´r ƒ´ kay ƒ´ pƒÅbƒÅgƒÅn ƒ´ az tohmag ƒ´ sƒÅsƒÅn ud nƒÅf ƒ´ dƒÅrƒÅy ≈°ƒÅh (\\"Ardashir, the Kayanian, son of Pabag from the parentage of Sasan and from the lineage of King Dara\\"). Another Middle Persian text, the Bundahishn, however, gives the genealogy of Ardashir as following: Artax≈°ahr ƒ´ PƒÅbagƒÅn kƒì-≈° mƒÅd duxt ƒ´ SƒÅsƒÅn ƒ´ Weh-ƒÅfrƒ´d (\\"Ardashir son of Pabag whose mother (was) the daughter of Sasan son of Weh- afrid\\"). This demonstrates the inconsistencies between Middle Persian texts regarding the origins of the Sasanian dynasty. Both sources regard Pabag as the father of Ardashir, whilst Sasan is presented as the latters grandfather or ancestor.  Roman and Armenian texts  In Roman and Armenian sources, a different account appears. According to the Roman historians Agathias and George Syncellus, Sasan was the biological father of Ardashir, whilst Pabag was his stepfather. The Armenian writers Movses Khorenatsi and Agathangelos likewise call Sasan the father of Ardashir. However, they do not make any mention of Pabag. A Greek variant of Agathangelos' work, calls Ardashir \\"son of Sasanus, which is the origin of the Sasanian name of the Persian kings descended from him\\".  Sasanian inscriptions and coinage  Ardashir, on his coin engravings and inscription on Naqsh-e Rostam claims to be the son of \\"divine Pabag, the king\\". His son and successor, Shapur I (), on his inscriptions at Naqsh-e Rajab, calls himself as a son of Ardashir I and grandson of Pabag.  Conclusions in modern scholarship =Biography Ruins of Istakhr, the capital of Pars Pabag ruled a small principality in the area of Khir, south of the Bakhtegan Lake. He was a vassal of Gochihr, the Bazrangid king of the Persian capital of Istakhr, who was in turn a vassal of the Arsacid King of Kings. With the permission of Gochihr, Pabag sent Ardashir to the fortress of Darabgerd to serve under its commander, Tiri. Pabag reportedly served as a priest of the fire-temple of Anahita in Istakhr, which served as a rallying point of the local Persian soldiers, who worshipped the Iranian goddess. The Arsacid Empire, then ruled by Vologases V (), was at this time in decline, due to wars with the Romans, civil wars and regional revolts. The Roman emperor Septimius Severus () had invaded the Arsacid domains in 196, and two years later did the same, this time sacking the Arsacid capital of Ctesiphon. At the same time, revolts occurred in Media and Pars. Coin minted under Pabag's son Shapur. The observe shows a portrait of the latter, whilst the reverse shows a portrait of Pabag The Iranologist Touraj Daryaee argues that the reign of Vologases V was \\"the turning point in Arsacid history, in that the dynasty lost much of its prestige.\\" The kings of Persis were now unable to depend on their weakened Arsacid overlords. Indeed, in 205/6, Pabag rebelled and overthrew Gochihr, taking Istakhr for himself. According to al- Tabari, it was at the urging of Ardashir that Pabag rebelled. However, Daryaee considers this statement unlikely, and states that it was in reality Shapur that helped Pabag to capture Istakhr, as demonstrated by the latter's coinage which has portraits of both them. There he appointed his eldest son Shapur as his heir. This was much to the dislike of Ardashir, who had become the commander of Darabgerd after the death of Tiri. Ardashir in an act of defiance, left for Ardashir-Khwarrah, where he fortified himself, preparing to attack his brother Shapur after Pabag's death. Pabag died a natural death sometime between 207‚Äì10 and was succeeded by Shapur.; ; After his death, both Ardashir and Shapur started minted coins with the title of \\"king\\" and the portrait of Pabag. The observe of Shapur's coins had the inscription \\"(His) Majesty, king Shapur\\" and the reverse had \\"son of (His) Majesty, king Pabag\\". Shapur's reign, however, proved short; he died under obscure conditions in 211/2. Ardashir thus succeeded Shapur, and went on to conquer the rest of Iran, establishing the Sasanian Empire in 224. Pabag was also survived by a daughter named Denag, who married Ardashir.

A traditional ruyi has a long S-shaped handle and a head fashioned like a fist, cloud, or lingzhi mushroom. Ruyi are constructed from diverse materials. For example, the Palace Museum in Beijing has nearly 3000 ruyi that are variously made from valuable materials such as gold, silver, iron, bamboo, wood, ivory, coral, rhinoceros horn, lacquer, crystal, jade, and precious gems. The \\"ruyi\\" image frequently appears as a motif in Asian art. Word The Chinese term ruyi is a compound of ru Â¶Ç \\"as; like; such as; as if; for example; supposing; be like; be similar; accord with\\" and yi ÊÑè \\"wish; will; desire; intention; suggestion; thought; idea; meaning; imagination\\". Standard Chinese uses ruyi either as a stative verb meaning \\"as desired; as one wishes, as one likes; according to one's wishes; following your heart's desires\\", or as an adjective meaning \\"satisfied, pleased, happy, comfortable\\". The word is combined with suanpan ÁÆóÁõ§ \\"abacus\\" in the expression ruyi suanpan to mean considering things only from a positive perspective; to be overly optimistic in one's plans. Chinese ruyi was borrowed as a Buddhist loanword into Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, with corresponding Sino-Xenic pronunciations (see Infobox above). History Qing Dynasty wood and jade three-inlay ruyi Chinese classic texts from the Former Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 24 AD) contain the earliest usages of the word ruyi. For example, the Shiji history uses it both literally for \\"as desired\\" and for the given name of Liu Ruyi ÂäâÂ¶ÇÊÑè (d. 195 BC), who was the son of Emperor Gaozu of Han and Concubine Qi. The Hanshu biography of the fangshi astrologer and mathematician Jing Fang (78‚Äì37 BCE) quotes him using ruyi meaning \\"as you wish\\" in an audience with Emperor Yuan of Han (tr. Edkins 1904: 238), \\"I fear that though your Majesty acts in this way you will still not obtain what accords with your wish.\\" The anthropologist Berthold Laufer (1912:336) said that the Chinese accounts of the ruyi are \\"more unsatisfactory\\" than for any other object in Chinese culture. Scholars have proposed two basic theories for the origin of the ruyi, writes Kieschnick (2003:141). The former is that ruyi originated from Sanskrit anuruddha \\"a ceremonial scepter\\" used by Buddhist monks in India, who later brought it to China, transliterated as analu ÈòøÈÇ£Âæã or translated as ruyi. The latter theory is that ruyi originated as a backscratcher in early China, and was amalgamated with the Buddhist symbol of authority. Davidson (1950:239) suggests \\"as desired\\" signifies a backscratcher owing to \\"its apparent ability to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the human body\\". During the Later Han dynasty (25‚Äì220 AD) and Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420 AD), literati and nobles often held ruyi during conversations and other social occasions. It was called a tanbing Ë´áÊüÑ \\"conversation baton\\" (cf. the Native American talking stick) and was used much like the zhuwei È∫àÂ∞æ \\"deer tail\\" (analogous to a fly whisk), which practitioners of the qingtan Ê∑∏Ë´á \\"pure conversation\\" movement popularized during the Six Dynasties period (220‚Äì589 AD). Besides the ruyi, other objects used as a tanbing \\"discussion stick\\" included the tanshan Ë´áÊâá \\"discussion fan\\" and tanzhu Ë´áÈ∫à made from the tail of a P√®re David's deer. Davidson (1950:247) says \\"there seems no doubt that the primary and original function of the ju-i was that of a scepter qualifying the holder to \\"take the floor.\\" Its origin was probably in India where the branch of a tree seems to have served a similar function. Any other purposes the ju-i served, such as a note tablet, honorific insignia, good luck gift, or even backscratcher, were merely later accruals.\\" The ca. 554 AD Weishu history records a story that when Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei (r. 471‚Äì499 AD) wanted to retire from the throne, he tested his sons by letting them choose among a number objects, and the one who selected a bone ruyi (symbolizing political rule) became Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei (r. 500‚Äì515). Kieschnick (2003:144) concludes \\"that by the end of the sixth century, not only was the ruyi common at court, but it had even begun to take on emblematic significance as the mark of a ruler.\\" Although the ruyi symbolized imperial political power, it differed from the Western royal scepter because Chinese officials and monks commonly used it. In Buddhist usage, holding a ruyi when teaching gave the holder the right to talk. The biography of Tiantai Buddhist patriarch Zhiyi (538-597) says that when he was teaching Prajna in place of his teacher Huisi ÊÖßÊÄù (515‚Äì577), Huisi would sit holding a ruyi in his hand (Davidson 1950:244). The (c. 886) Duyang zabian ÊùúÈôΩÈõúÁ∑®, which is a collection of Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) stories, records that Emperor Wenzong presented an ivory ruyi to his tutor Li Xun ÊùéË®ì (d. 835) and said (tr. Kieschnick 2003:145), \\"The ruyi may serve you as a lecture baton (tanbing).\\" The (945) Old Book of Tang biography of Li Xun (tr. Davidson 1950:247) says this occurred on a hot summer day and the emperor's ruyi present was made from \\"heat-repelling rhinoceros horn\\", which is believed to be cooling in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Ruyi were both emblems of power and tools of discourse. Herbert Giles (1912:185) quoted the Song dynasty archaeologist Zhao Xigu Ë∂ôÂ∏åÈµ† (d. 1240) that the ruyi \\"was originally made of iron, and was used 'for pointing the way' and also 'for guarding against the unexpected,' i.e. for self-defence. It was, in fact, a kind of blunt sword, and traces of basket-work are still to be found inside what must have been the sword-guard.\\" In the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644 AD), ruyi became popular as ornaments or gifts symbolizing blessings and good luck. The ca. 1627 AD Zhangwuzhi Èï∑Áâ©Âøó \\"Treatise on Superfluous Things\\", by Ming painter Wen Zhenheng, discussed ruyi aesthetics. > The ruyi was used in ancient times to give directions or to protect oneself > from the unexpected. It was for this reason that it was made or iron, and > not on the basis of strictly aesthetic considerations. If you can obtain an > old iron ruyi inlaid with gold and silver that sparkle now and then, and if > it has an ancient dull color, this is the best. As for ruyi made of natural > branches or from bamboo and so on, these are all worthless. (tr. Kieschnick > 2003:151) During the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912 AD), ruyi scepters became luxuriant symbols of political power that were regularly used in imperial ceremonies, and were highly valued as gifts to and from the Emperor of China. Since 3 and 9 are considered lucky numbers in Chinese culture, Qing craftsmen elaborated the traditional handle and head type ruyi into two-headed sanjiang-ruyi ‰∏âÈë≤Â¶ÇÊÑè \\"3-inlay ruyi\\" with precious stones set in both heads and middle of the handle and jiujiu-ruyi ‰πù‰πùÂ¶ÇÊÑè \\"9-9 ruyi\\" presentational sets of nine. The Qianlong Emperor presented a ruyi to the British ambassador George Macartney in 1793, and in his description (quoted by Kieschnick 2003:139-140), \\"It is a whitish, agate-looking stone, about a foot and a half long, curiously carved, and highly prized by the Chinese, but to me it does not appear in itself to be of any great value.\\" During the historical evolution of Chinese ruyi \\"as desired\\", they have been used as backscratchers, ritual objects in Buddhism and later Daoism, pointers for public speakers, prized icons of political power and wealth, and auspicious gifts expressing best wishes. Art Manjusri holding a ruyi, Blanc-de-Chine figure by He Chaozong, 17th century Emperor Xuan of Chen holding a ruyi, Yan Liben's \\"Thirteen Emperors Scroll\\", 7th century In Chinese art, ruyi scepters often appear as attributes of Buddhist saints and Daoist xian. The god of prosperity Cai Shen Ë≤°Á•û is often depicted holding a ruyi. Stylized repetitions of the shape are incorporated as a motif in the depiction of heavenly clouds. Ruyi symbolize achieving prosperity in fengshui practice. The ruyi shape appears as a motif in decorative knots, Oriental rug patterns, folk artifacts, and even modern corporate logos. Stylized ruyi often function as a kind of ante-fixae or palmette in traditional and modern architecture. Two types of ruyi are seen in Chinese Buddhist art. The early ruyi was common in Buddhist sculpture and painting from the late Six dynasties (220‚Äì589) through the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì906). It was a slender stick, varying from about 15 to 24 inches, which widened and curved slightly at one end. Not only were these utensils frequently portrayed by artists and sculptors, but the Sh≈çs≈çin treasure house of T≈çdai-ji temple, in Nara, has preserved several 8th-century ruyi (Davidson 1950:242). The modern ruyi, which first appeared in the art of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) has two forms. The first type shows minor elaborations upon the basic slender-handled structure of the early ruyi, but the slight curve at the top was exaggerated into a decorative ornament, a medallion-like form, frequently a stylized fungus. The second type of contemporary ruyi shows a radical change, in addition to the decorated end, two other smaller inlaid plaques or medallions, with one at the middle of the handle and the other at the base. Variations occur where the center medallion becomes a rectangle, or the second is omitted (Davidson 1950:242-243). In early Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, the bodhisattva Manjusri is usually depicted holding a sword (representing wisdom that cuts through ignorance), except in representations of his Vimalakirti Sutra discussion with the layman Vimalakirti, when Manjusri holds a ruyi scepter (Davidson 1950:240). This representation expanded in the 10th century, concurrent with the change in ruyi forms, and holding a ruyi became an attribute of other divinities as well as Chinese emperors (Davidson 1950:244). Berthold Laufer (1912: 339) believed the first Chinese representation of a ruyi was in an 8th-century Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ painting by Wu Daozi, which showed it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. Laufer noted the artistic similarly between the curved handle of a ruyi and the long stem of a lotus blossom, which was frequently depicted in the hands of Bodhisattvas, e.g., the Longmen Grottoes. > I do not mean to say that the Buddhist emblem called Ju-i has developed from > the lotus, though I think that the alternation of both is suggestive. But it > is not necessary at all to assume that the Chinese Ju-i in general is of > Buddhist origin... It may very well be that the implement is Chinese in > origin and even prebuddhistic, and that, as in so many other things, a kind > of compromise took place, resulting in the assimilation and amalgamation of > two ideas and two forms. (1912:339) Admitting that the \\"original significance of this implement has been lost long ago\\", Laufer hypothesized that the ruyi may have developed from a ritual jade that began as a Zhou dynasty \\"symbol of light, generative power and fertility\\". Two of the emperors in the famous Thirteen Emperors Scroll by Yan Liben (d. 673) are holding ruyi (Davidson 1950:247), Emperor Wen of Chen (r. 559‚Äì566) and Emperor Xuan of Chen (r. 569‚Äì582). Japanese painters variously pictured Manjusri holding a ruyi in either hand (Laufer 1912:338). Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç (1420‚Äì1506) showed one in his left hand and nothing in his right. Kichizan Minch≈ç ÂêâÂ±±ÊòéÂÖÜ (1352‚Äì1431) and Kan≈ç Sanraku (1559‚Äì1635) showed the Bodhisattva with a ruyi in his right and a book-roll in his left. A 12th-century Manjusri painting attributed to the Kose School a sword in his right and a sacred lotus-flower in his left hand. Word usage in East Asian Buddhism With the introduction of Buddhism to China, scholars used Chinese ruyi to translate various Sanskrit terms, which Buddhism in Japan subsequently borrowed as nyoi. The primary terms and Chinese/Japanese translations are: *anuruddha \\"a ceremonial mace; a priest's staff\\", ruyi/nyoi Â¶ÇÊÑè *kalpavriksha \\"wish fulfilling tree; the manifestation of what one wishes\\", ruyishu/nyoiju Â¶ÇÊÑèÊ®π *cintamani \\"wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires\\", ruyizhu/nyoiju Â¶ÇÊÑèÁè† or ruyibaozhu/nyoi-h≈çshu Â¶ÇÊÑèÂÆùÁè† First, the anuruddha/ruyi/nyoi scepter is defined in the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism: > An instrument held, especially by the abbot of a temple, during ceremonies > and sermons shaped as a short staff curled in an S-shape and made out of > wood, or more precious materials, such as ivory. One end is broader than the > other, and often has a metal plate with a decorative cloud-shaped stamp. It > is said to originally have been a back-scratcher that was carried by > Buddhist monks. In some schools of Zen like Sanbo Kyodan, the ceremonial scepter of a r≈çshi is called kotsu instead of nyoi. > The scepter has a slight S-shaped curve, like a human spinal column. The > r≈çshi uses the kotsu, for example, to emphasize a point in a teish≈ç, to lean > on when sitting, or also occasionally to strike a student. (Diener, Erhard, > and Fischer-Schreiber 1991:119) Second, the divine kalpavriksha/ruyishu/nyoiju is a wishing tree in Hindu mythology. The Buddhist translator Samuel Beal (1884:105) explained it denotes \\"power to produce whatever was wished\\". The Chinese Buddhist monk Yi Jing Áæ©Âáà, who travelled in India from 673 to 695, translated kalpavriksha as ruyishu in describing the Uposatha day celebration (tr. Takakusu 1896:49), \\"Then gifts are distributed. Sometimes the host provides a 'wishing tree' (Kalpa-vriksha), and gives it to the priests\\". Since it is unlikely that a real tree could have been given, Davidson (1950:247) notes that \\"some sort of symbolic tree was deemed appropriate as a gift to a Buddhist priest.\\" Third, the legendary cintamani \\"wish-fulfilling jewel; jewel that grants all desires\\" is translated either with zhu/shu Áè† \\"pearl; bead\\" or baozhu/h≈çju ÂØ∂Áè† \\"precious pearl; jewel\\". This famous term is frequently used in literature and art. The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism explains: > A ma·πái-jewel; magical jewel, which manifests whatever one wishes for (Skt. > ma·πái, cintƒÅ-ma·πái, cintƒÅma·πái-ratna).

Erik Z√ºrcher (1997:407) suggests that association between ruyi and the legendary ruyibao \\"wish-fulfilling gem\\" explains the dichotomy between it being both a mundane backscratcher and a Buddhist symbol. The ca. 1150 AD Fus≈ç ryakki Êâ∂Ê°ëÁï•Ë®ò \\"Brief History of Fusang\\" by K≈çen ÁöáÂúì, the teacher of H≈çnen, recounts a Japanese nyoi-h≈çju legend involving the monk Foshi \\"Buddha's Vow\\" (Japanese Bussei). > There lived in Northern India a Buddhist abbot, \\"Buddha's vow\\" by name, who > for the sake of mankind sought the \\"Precious pearl which grants all > desires\\". He went on board a ship and, when in the midst of the sea, by > Buddha's power called up the Dragon-king. After having bound him by means of > mystic formulae (tantras), he required the pearl from him, whereupon the > dragon, unable to escape, took the pearl from his head and prepared to hand > it over to the priest. The latter stretched out his left hand, at the same > time making the \\"sword-sign\\"', a mudrƒÅ (mystic finger-twisting), with his > right hand. The Dragon-king, however, said: \\"In former times, when the > Dragon-king SƒÅgara's daughter gave a precious pearl to CƒÅkyamuni, the latter > received it with folded hands; why should a pupil of the Buddha accept it > with one hand?\\" Then the priest folded his hands, giving up the mudrƒÅ, and > was about to take the pearl, when the Dragon-king, no longer suppressed by > the mystic sign, freed himself from his bands and ascended to the sky, > leaving the abbot behind with empty hands, and destroying his boat. The only > man who was saved was the priest himself. Afterwards the same abbot met > Bodhidharma, the patriarch, who came across the sea from Southern India (in > 526), and together they went to Japan.

Recording and composition After enjoying enormous success as a songwriter in 1970 and 1971, including Song of the Year awards from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, Kristofferson‚Äôs second album, The Silver Tongued Devil and I, established him as a recording artist in his own right. However, after having the luxury of honing his compositions over a period of years, he had just a matter of months to write songs for Border Lord. As noted by AllMusic's William Ruhlmann: A dominant theme in the songs on Border Lord is the ill treatment of women, with six tunes, including ‚ÄúJosie‚Äù and ‚ÄúLittle Girl Lost,‚Äù concerning females who had become debased in some way, for which the narrator seems to feel some vicarious or personal guilt. The image of the Devil, already prominent in previous compositions like ‚ÄúThe Silver Tongued Devil and I‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo Beat the Devil,‚Äù reappears in five of the songs, giving the collection a desperate, despairing mood overall. Now in demand as a touring performer, two songs, ‚ÄúGetting‚Äô By, High and Strange‚Äù and the title track reflected his current circumstances on the road. Two songs, ‚ÄúJosie,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurden of Freedom,‚Äù mined similar territory thematically as ‚ÄúMe and Bobby McGee,‚Äù but when the latter was released as the album‚Äôs lone single it only struggled into the lower reaches of the pop charts. In 2019, Sheryl Crow released her own version of the title track featuring Kristofferson on her album Threads. Reception Border Lord was released in February 1972 but failed to achieve the success its predecessors had. At the time of its release, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone was unkind, charging that Kristofferson was ‚Äúa fast-livin‚Äô, hard lovin‚Äô dude who has just enough time between ballin‚Äô and brawlin‚Äô to jot down a tune or two. He‚Äôs a cracker-barrel philosopher‚Ä¶Kris‚Äô celebrations of machismo are his most patently stupid observations.‚Äù Biographer Stephen Miller opines ‚ÄúWhile Kris produced some of his affecting poetry with characteristic cleverness, the melodies were unremarkable and with his limited vocal range, a number of the songs suffered from a dirgeful quality.‚Äù AllMusic lamented the rushed gestation of the songs, remarking ‚ÄúNo doubt Kristofferson and Monument would have been better advised to have waited until he had a collection of songs to match his early hits; instead, he quickly began work on yet another album, Jesus Was a Capricorn, which was out before the end of the year.‚Äù Writer Michael Streissguth praises the album, maintaining it offered lyrical themes that remained ‚Äústrongly individualistic and never failed to challenge Nashville‚Äôs sensibilities.‚Äù In a 2016 Rolling Stone interview with Neil Strauss, Kristofferson said he was pleasantly surprised with the box set of his work The Complete Monument & Columbia Album Collection, particularly Border Lord, admitting, \\"I can remember at the time being so disappointed at the reception it got.\\" Track listing All songs by Kris Kristofferson except as noted #\\"Josie\\" ‚Äì 3:12 #\\"Burden of Freedom\\" ‚Äì 3:22 #\\"Stagger Mountain Tragedy\\" ‚Äì 2:53 #\\"Border Lord\\" (Stephen Bruton, Donnie Fritts, Terry Paul, Kristofferson) ‚Äì 3:38 #\\"Somebody Nobody Knows\\" ‚Äì 3:36 #\\"Little Girl Lost\\" ‚Äì 3:10 #\\"Smokey Put the Sweat on Me\\" ‚Äì 3:10 #\\"When She's Wrong\\" ‚Äì 4:47 #\\"Gettin' By, High and Strange\\" ‚Äì 2:37 #\\"Kiss the World Goodbye\\" ‚Äì 3:01 Personnel *Kris Kristofferson - vocals, guitar *Rita Coolidge - vocals *Pete Drake - steel guitar *Donnie Fritts - keyboards, background vocals *Dennis Linde - guitar *Billy Swan - bass, background vocals *Stephen Bruton - guitar, background vocals *Kenneth A.

It measures 142 metres in height, has 36 floors and was constructed between 1954 and 1957. It was designed by the architects Juli√°n and Jos√© Mar√≠a Otamendi Machimbarrena as an assignment of the Metropolitan Real Estate Agency, for whom they had already built the Edificio Espa√±a. It is situated on the Plaza de Espa√±a, being a symbolic building for the plaza and the city. It holds offices and apartments. It was the highest office building in Western Europe until 1967, when it was surpassed by the 150-metre high South Tower in Brussels. The Tower appeared in numerous Spanish movies released in the 1960s. The tower was conceived to be the tallest concrete building in the world at the time of its completion and until the construction of Torrespa√±a was the highest building in Madrid. The lead architects also envisioned that the building would harbour 500 stores, spacious galleries, a hotel, and even a cinema. Furthermore, the tower was equipped with twelve elevators of the fastest model of the time, permitting users to travel 3.5 metres per second. The works were finished on October 15, 1957. The Tower of Madrid is found in the Plaza de Espa√±a, at the end of the street of Gran Via, in the heart of the Spanish capital. Along with the 117-metre-tall Edificio de Espa√±a, situated in the same plaza, they form an interesting architectural assembly. Both enjoy protection on the part of the City Hall of the capital. It was the tallest building in Spain until 1982, when it was surpassed by the Torrespa√±a telecommunications tower. It forms part of the Gran Via skyscraper zone, to the contrary that most of the skyscrapers with a height of 100+ metres in the city, situated in the financial district of AZCA, in the neighborhood of Tetu√°n. On April 28, 2005, the tower was put up for sale by the real estate agency Metrovacesa along with the Edificio Espa√±a to vote part of the acquisition of the French company Gecina. The price was about 400.000.000 ‚Ç¨. The building was redeveloped in 2012 with apartments on floors 10-32, while the Hotel Barcel√≥ Torre de Madrid opened on floors 1-9 in 2017.https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist- information/torre-madrid  In Media  The building is depicted in 1984 movie The Hit.

He spent the majority of his club career playing as a centre- forward for West Bromwich Albion, where he earned the nickname \\"The Tank\\".Our Favourite Players ‚Äì Final List In 1961‚Äì62 he was joint leading scorer in Division One ‚Äì alongside Ray Crawford of Ipswich Town ‚Äì with 33 goals. He also won 14 caps for the England national football team, scoring a total of eight goals, including two in the 1958 FIFA World Cup Finals.  Club career  Kevan was born in Ripon. His father Albert, formerly an officer in the Royal Marines, worked as a pipe-layer. Kevan started his career in his native Yorkshire with Bradford Park Avenue. Kevan was the first signing made by the former Tottenham Hotspur full-back Vic Buckingham after he had taken over from Jesse Carver as manager of West Bromwich Albion in February 1953. Signed for ¬£2,000, Kevan completed his National Service in the Army before establishing himself full-time at The Hawthorns. Coached by the club's former striker W.G. Richardson, Kevan had to wait until August 1955 to make his West Bromwich Albion League debut, a 2‚Äì0 home win over Everton in which he scored twice after being selected in place of the injured Ronnie Allen. He became a regular in the first team during the 1956‚Äì57 season, and his committed and powerful style of play earned him the nickname \\"The Tank\\" from the Albion supporters. Kevan scored 20 goals in the 1956‚Äì57 season, which included a run to the FA Cup semi-finals where Albion lost to Aston Villa. He scored 80 goals over the next three seasons ‚Äì 23 in 1957‚Äì58, 28 in 1958‚Äì59 and 29 in 1959‚Äì60, including five in a 6‚Äì2 home League win over Everton. He added 18 in 1960‚Äì61 and then claimed 33 League goals the following season, when he finished joint top scorer in the First Division with Ipswich Town's Ray Crawford. This remains the highest post-war League total by an Albion player. In March 1963, after scoring 16 goals in 28 appearances that season, including four against Fulham, Kevan was transferred to Chelsea for ¬£50,000. In a decade at Albion, he had scored 173 goals in 291 games. His spell at Stamford Bridge under Tommy Docherty was short and unsuccessful, and in the close season of the same year he moved to Second Division Manchester City for ¬£35,000. Kevan made his Manchester City debut on the opening day of the 1963‚Äì64 season against Portsmouth, and scored his first goal for the club four days later, at Cardiff. Following the arrival of Jimmy Murray from Wolves in November, he and Kevan formed a productive strike partnership. From late November to the end of December, Kevan scored in eight consecutive matches. This included a run of six league games in which Murray and Kevan scored 21 goals between them. Kevan's goals also helped Manchester City to the semi-finals of the League Cup, a run in which Kevan scored in every round. Kevan finished the season as the club's leading goalscorer with 36 goals, 30 of them in the league. Kevan continued to score regularly in the 1964‚Äì65 season. His goals included a first half hat-trick at Preston North End. However, his season was curtailed when he suffered a knee injury in a match at Derby County on 30 January. This proved to be his last match for the club, and on 29 July 1965 he moved to Crystal Palace. In total Kevan scored 56 goals in all competitions in 76 appearances for the Maine Road club. Brief spells at several lower league clubs followed. He joined Crystal Palace in July 1965, making 21 League appearances and scoring five goals before moving to Peterborough United in March 1966, and then Luton Town. In March 1967, Kevan joined Stockport County, in an exchange deal involving Keith Allen. At Stockport, Kevan gained the first medal of his career, the Fourth Division title in 1967. After winding down his career in non-League football, he was the landlord of the Moss Rose pub, adjacent to Macclesfield Town's ground of the same name. He also worked as a delivery driver before returning to The Hawthorns in 1983 to work as a lottery agent as well as playing for the Albion All Stars charity team, which he later managed. Kevan died on 4 January 2013 aged 77, leaving a wife, Connie. In tribute to Kevan, West Bromwich Albion players wore black armbands for their FA Cup match the day after his death. International career Kevan scored eight goals in 14 appearances for England. He scored on his debut against Scotland at Wembley in a 2‚Äì1 win in April 1957, and netted twice in the 1958 World Cup Finals in Sweden, against the Soviet Union and Austria, after he was selected for the squad in preference to Brian Clough. His last England appearance came against Mexico in 1961. He also gained under-23 honours and netted a hat-trick for the Football League against the Scottish League in 1958.

The film stars Matthias Schweigh√∂fer, Joseph Fiennes, Til Schweiger and Lena Headey. The Red Baron was filmed entirely in English to improve its international commercial viability. Plot In 1916, Manfred von Richthofen is serving as a fighter pilot with the Imperial German Air Service along the Western Front. After dropping a wreath over the funeral of an Allied pilot, Richthofen and his fellow pilots Werner Voss and Friedrich Sternberg encounter a squadron of enemy aircraft led by Captain Lanoe Hawker. Richthofen shoots down Canadian pilot Arthur Roy Brown. After pulling Brown out of the wreckage of his aircraft, Richthofen assists Nurse K√§te Otersdorf with a tourniquet on Brown's leg. After killing Hawker, Richthofen is awarded the Pour le M√©rite medal and promoted to command a squadron. He is joined by his brother Lothar von Richthofen (Volker Bruch). He orders his men to avoid killing enemy pilots unless absolutely necessary and is dismayed when Lothar deliberately strafes and kills a British pilot who has already been forced into a landing. Later, during an aerial dogfight, Richthofen again encounters Captain Brown, who has escaped from a German prisoner of war camp after being nursed by K√§te. Both are forced to ditch their aircraft in no man's land, where they share a friendly drink. Brown expresses hope that they will not meet again until after the war is over, and he tells Richthofen that K√§te has feelings for him. On the way back to base, Richthofen is devastated to learn that his close friend, the Jewish pilot Friedrich Sternberg, has been shot down and killed. Over the days that follow, Richthofen makes no secret of his grief and refuses to leave his room. An enraged Lothar reminds him that, \\"A leader cannot afford to mourn.\\" Shortly thereafter, Richthofen suffers a skull wound during an aerial battle, and is sent to be nursed by K√§te. As he recovers, the two share a romantic dinner and a dance. After Richthofen expresses gratitude for his wound keeping him out of the fighting, an angry K√§te takes him on a tour of a local field hospital, berating him for regarding war as a game. Later, Richthofen and K√§te are beginning to make love when they are interrupted by an Allied bombing raid. Determined to protect the squadron's aircraft, he orders K√§te to hide in the cellar and takes to the air with his men. During the raid, Richthofen's wound begins to reopen, making him disoriented, and upon witnessing the death of his protege Kurt Wolff, he goes into a state of rage in the air. During another visit, Richthofen informs Kate that he has been offered a rear echelon position in command of the entire Air Service. K√§te is overjoyed, but a depressed Richthofen conceals his doubts. Richthofen sees he is being manipulated by the Kaiser and his generals. While visiting the Fokker Industries Richtofen discovers that Werner Voss, the most competitive pilot of the squadron after him and his dear friend, died in a dogfight, thus leaving the squadron with very few experienced pilots. On the eve of the February 1918 offensive, he approaches general Paul von Hindenburg and tells him that the war is now unwinnable, however, Hindenburg orders him back to his squadron. Caught between his disgust for the war, and the responsibility for his fighter wing, Richthofen sets out to fly again. As the offensive begins, Richthofen's squadron sets out to clear every Allied aeroplane and balloon out of the target area. As K√§te tends the wounded on the ground, she is horrified to learn that her beloved has returned to combat. K√§te confronts him and demands to know why he has turned down the chance to remain safe. Richthofen states that he will not betray the soldiers in the field. He says, \\"You are my greatest victory.\\" On April 21, 1918, Richthofen is wakened with the report of a British formation approaching the front, after making love to K√§te. He has a brief talk with his pilots and tells Wolfram not to get involved in combat. As Richthofen climbs into his cockpit, he exchanges a sad smile with K√§te. K√§te crosses over to Allied lines with Brown's assistance and visits Richthofen's grave. She apologises for not coming sooner and expresses remorse for never telling him how much she loved him.

Andrew Lang adapted a variant of it for The Orange Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Orange Fairy Book, \\"The Enchanted Wreath\\" It is Aarne-Thompson type 403B, the black and the white bride, and includes an episode of type 480, the kind and the unkind girls. Synopsis A man had a wife, and both of them had a daughter from an earlier marriage. One day, the man took his daughter to cut wood and found when he returned that he had left his axe. He told his wife to send her daughter for it, so it would not grow rusty. The stepmother said that his daughter was already wet and, besides, was a strong girl who could take a little wet and cold. The girl found three doves perched on the axe, looking miserable. She told them to fly back home, where it would be warmer, but first gave them crumbs from her bread. She took the axe and left. Eating the crumbs made the birds feel much better, and they lay on her head an unfading wreath of roses, with tiny birds singing in it. The stepmother pulled it off, and the birds flew off and the roses withered. The next day, the father went alone and left his axe again. The stepmother was delighted and sent her own daughter. She found the doves and ordered them off as \\"dirty creatures.\\" They cursed her to never be able to say anything except \\"dirty creatures.\\" The stepmother beat her stepdaughter, and was all the angrier when the doves restored the wreath to its condition and the girl's head. One day, a king's son saw her and took her off to marry her. The news of them made the stepmother and her daughter quite ill, but they recovered when the stepmother made a plan. She had a witch make a mask of her stepdaughter's face. Then she visited her, threw her into the water, and put her daughter in her place, before setting out to see if the same witch could give her something to cure the doves' curse on her daughter. Her husband was distraught by the change in her, but thought it stemmed from an illness. He thought he saw his bride in the water, but she vanished. After twice more seeing her, he was able to catch her. She turned into various animals, a hare, a fish, a bird, and a snake, but he cut off the snake's head, and the bride became a human again. The stepmother returned with an ointment that would work only if the true bride had really been drowned; she put it on her daughter's tongue and found it did not work. The prince found them and said they deserved to die, but the stepdaughter had persuaded him to merely abandon them on a desert island.

The standards set the criteria for the successful demonstration of the understanding of a concept or skill. Overview of standards-based assessment In the standards-based paradigm, students have the freedom to demonstrate understanding in diverse ways, including (but not limited to) selected response (e.g. multiple choice tests), physical constructions, written responses, and performances. Of course, these are not new types of assessments, nor is the concept of differentiated assessment. The teacher uses all available observations and quantitative information to summarize learning with reference to a specific standard. With these data, a teacher can formulate the steps or actions that can be taken to gain mastery of a particular concept. That is, it aids in assessment for learning. One of the key aspects of standards-based assessment is post- assessment feedback. The feedback a student receives from this type of assessment does not emphasize a score, percentage, or statistical average, but information about the expectations of performance as compared to the standard. A standards-based approach does not necessarily dismiss a summative grade, percentage, or a measure of central tendency (such as a mean, or median). However, an assessment that does not reference or give feedback with respect to a standard would not be standards-based. There is a large body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of appropriate feedback. Purpose of standards-based assessment The purpose of standards-based assessment is to connect evidence of learning to learning outcomes (the standards). When standards are explicit and clear, the learner becomes aware of his/her achievement with reference to the standards, and the teacher may use assessment data to give meaningful feedback to students about this progress. The awareness of one's own learning allows students to point to a specific standard of achievement and so strengthens self-regulation and meta-cognition, two skills generally understood to be effective learning strategies. Framework of the standards-based approach in assessment A common approach to standards-based assessment (SBA) is: * Identify a key fact or important body of knowledge (e.g. a scientific theory, a mathematical relationship), the essential content and concepts. * Identify the indicators (i.e. evidence) that students will show when the concept or content has been understood. * Choose a collection of assessments that will allow students to demonstrate the indicators. * Using a scale or rubric, identify the proficiency of the student with respect to the standard. This progress is made accessible to the learner in order to provide meaningful feedback. Any feedback should be able to provide information on how the proficiency can be improved) and the educator needs to be aware of the effects of praise during feedback. * Repeat instruction, assessment and feedback until the student achieves a predetermined level of mastery. Hallmarks of standards-based assessment * Standards (i.e. learning outcomes) need to be visible and understandable by students * Tasks, activities and assessments should be clear about which standard is being practiced * Formative assessment should be used to give feedback to students about their progress towards a standard * Assessment in general should be well-designed, accurate and high in validity to be fair and accessible * Exemplars should be used to give students an understanding of how achievement against a standard is measured * Rubrics should be used to assess performances and constructed responses * Selective response (e.g. multiple choice) should be used to assess basic understanding and knowledge (as in Bloom's Taxonomy) of a specific standard (or the underlying pre-requisite concepts associated with the standard) Geographical Distinctions=United States A standards-based test is an assessment based on the outcome-based education or performance-based education philosophy. January 18, 2006 Standards- Based Test draws plan for awareness Jackie Schlotfeldt News- Bulletin Staff Writer Valencia County News-Bulletin \\"With the New Mexico Standards Based Assessments just a little over a month away\\" Assessment is a key part of the standards reform movement. The first part is to set new, higher standards to be expected of every student. Then the curriculum must be aligned to the new standards. Finally, the student must be assessed if they meet these standards of what every student \\"must know and be able to do\\". In the United States, a high school diploma which is given on passing a high school graduation examination or Certificate of Initial Mastery is awarded only when these standards are achieved. It is fully expected that every child will become proficient in all areas of academic skills by the end of a period, typically 10 years in the United States, but sometimes longer, after the passing of education reform bill by a state legislature. The United States federal government, under No Child Left Behind can further require that all schools must demonstrate improvement among all students, even if they are already all over proficient. =Holistic grading= Rather than using computers to log responses to multiple choice tests, rubrics for state assessments such as in North Carolina AFT - Hot Topics - Standards-Based Reform North Carolina Focused Holistic Scoring Guide: The Expository Composition Grade 7, ask scorers to look at the entire paper and make judgments. Scorers are not allowed to count errors, and rubrics do not contain numeric measurements of how many spelling or grammar error constitute a \\"1\\" or \\"2\\". The Analytical Writing section of the GRE test is scored using a six- point holistic scale in half-point increments.GRE Update - March 2006 The Analytical Writing section of the General Test will continue to be scored using the six-point holistic scale in half-point increments Holistic grading is one of the main reason for disagreement between scorers, but for this reason some tests are scored more than once to check for agreement. =Advantages of Standards-based Assessment= * Students are compared to a standard that all can reach, rather than artificially ranked into a bell curve where some students must be called failures, and only a few are allowed to succeed * Humans, not computers can evaluate the entire value of a response rather than imposing a strict right or wrong that is not open to interpretation * Free response uses and tests for higher order thinking, which is important in most new education standards. * Computer scored multiple choice tests have been shown to have deleterious effects for minorities, unfairly denying opportunities. * Only a standards-based test is aligned with standards-based education reform, which is based on a belief that all students can succeed, not only a few. * Passing a 10th grade test and awarding a Certificate of Initial Mastery ensures that all students will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the world-class economy of the twenty-first century. * Students will no longer be cheated by passing them on to the next grade without obtaining what every child at the grade level must be able to know and do. * When all students pass all standards, as is the central belief of standards-based education reform, all students from all demographics will achieve the same test score, eliminating the mysterious achievement gap which has previously been shown to occur between all groups on all tests. However, as of 2006, no standards-based assessment has yet achieved this optimistic (critics might call it impossible) goal, though many show rising scores. =Cons= Compared to a multiple-choice, norm-referenced test, a standards- based test can be recognized by: * A cut score is determined for different levels of performance. There are no cut scores for norm-referenced tests. There is no failing score on the SAT test. Each college or institution sets their own score standards for admission or awards. * Different levels of performance are set. Typically these are Above Standard, Meets Standard, Below Standard. These levels a typically set in a benchmarking process, even though such a process does not take into an account whether the test items are even appropriate for the grade level. * Tests are holistically graded against a free-written response, often with pictures, rather than graded correct or incorrect among multiple choices. * Tests are more expensive to grade because of this, typically $25‚Äì30 per test compared to $2‚Äì$5, not including the cost of developing the test, typically different every year for every state. * Tests are more difficult to grade because they are typically graded against a handful with no more than one or two example papers at each scoring level. They cannot be graded by computer * Tests are less reliable. Agreement may fall between 60 and 80 percent on a 4-point scale and be considered to be accurate. * Graders do not need teaching credentials, only a bachelor's degree in any field, and are typically paid $8 to $11 per hour for part-time work. * Failure rates as high as 80 to 95 percent are not only not unusual, they are fully expected and announced as test programs are introduced to the local press. Under traditional graduation criteria, African Americans had achieved national graduation rates within a few points of whites. In 2006, three- quarters of African Americans who failed the WASL were promised by Superintendent Terry Bergeson that they would not get a diploma if they did not pass retakes of the test in two years, even though she had pledged earlier that \\"all students\\" would get a world class diploma. * Failure rates for minorities and special education students are typically two to four times higher than for majority groups as extended response questions are more difficult to answer than multiple choice * Content is often difficult even for adults to quickly answer, even at grade levels as low as the fourth grade, especially in mathematics. Professor Don Orlich called the WASL a \\"disaster\\", with math and science tests falling well above the normal development level of students at many grade levels. * Mathematics has a high proportion of statistics and geometry, and a low content of simple arithmetic. * Schools are scored as zero for students who do not take the test. * Passing such a test at the 10th grade level is typically planned as being required for graduating high school. * Passing such a test, rather than the 50th percentile, is defined as grade level performance. * A question with a correct answer may be graded as incorrect if it does not show how the answer as arrived at. A question with an incorrect numerical conclusion may not necessarily be graded as wrong.1997 WASL math released problems * California's first year of the CLAS test permitted no '4' high math grades, not even in the highest scoring schools, in order to leave room for improvementtestimony of Maureen DiMarco to Washington State legislators * The North Carolina Writing project gave out less than 1 percent exemplary '4' scores. Such papers employed vocabulary and knowledge on a level sometimes exceeding that of the college graduate graders, and well above the intended audience of a high school graduation.At a grading session in Auburn in 2004, no graders could identify some of the words used in some papers This level would be even more difficult than achieving an SAT score sufficient for entry into an Ivy League private college. * Scores typically rise much faster than standardized tests such as NAEP or SAT given over the same time period.Rand study of Kentucky KIRIS See also  ReferencesExternal links * American Federation of Teachers.

Mosinee to Merrill WIS107 in downtown Marathon City Highway 107 heads due north from Highway 153 into the village of Marathon City, where it becomes Main Street. Crossing the Big Rib River, it meets up with Highway 29 at the latter's exit 156. Highway 107 continues north into the unincorporated community of Little Chicago. About two miles north of the Marathon/Lincoln County line, it intersects with Wisconsin Highway 64 and continues north, then east, with WIS 64 towards Merrill. Merrill Entering Merrill, Highway 107 and Highway 64 run alongside the banks of the Wisconsin River, across from Council Grounds State Park. After briefly running through the city of Merrill's Sixth Ward along West Main Street, the two highways cross over the Wisconsin River - twice. The river is divided by a small island where West Main Street crosses into the uptown portion of the city of Merrill. The two highways separate at the Y-intersection of Grand Avenue and Main Street, with Highway 64 continuing east over the Prairie River into downtown Merrill, while Highway 107 turns sharply to the northwest along Grand Avenue. Highway 107 continues northwest, past the Merrill Area Recreation Complex and the main entrance to Council Grounds State Park, before turning north out of the city. Merrill to Tomahawk Northern terminus by Tomahawk North of Merrill, Highway 107 runs along the eastern banks of the Wisconsin River as a rural two-lane highway all the way to its northern terminus with County Highway S outside of Tomahawk. The terminus is somewhat unusual, as state highways in Wisconsin normally end at another state trunk highway. Highway S, however, was the former route of US Highway 51 as it entered Tomahawk. When the US 51 bypass freeway was finished east of the city, the former route of US 51 was turned back to county control, resulting in the unusual terminus.

Holistic grading can also be used to assess classroom-based work. Rather than counting errors, a paper is judged holistically and often compared to an anchor paper to evaluate if it meets a writing standard.  Model  While analytic grading involves criterion-by- criterion judgments, holistic grading appraises student works as integrated entities. In holistic grading, the learner's performance is approached as one and cannot be reduced or divided into several component performances. Here, teachers are required to consider specific aspects of the student's answer as well as the quality of the whole. Holistic grading operates by distinguishing satisfactory performance from one that is simply adequate or outstanding. Projects using holistic grading Many institutions use holistic grading when evaluating student writing as part of a graduation requirement.

He is remembered for his monumental orchestral works, having been the first Azerbaijani to compose a symphony (1936). He studied under Azerbaijan's Founder of Composed Music, Uzeyir HajibeyovUzeyir Hajibeyov and his role in the development of musical life of Azerbaijan, Matthew O'brien, Soviet Music and Society Under Lenin and Stalin: The Baton and Sickle, ed. Neil Edmunds, (Routledge Curzon, 2004), 217. and under Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Early life Hajiyev was born in Shaki (then Nukha), a town in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains in northwestern Azerbaijan. From an early age, he was deeply influenced by the traditional music of folk songs, ashug music (folk minstrel) and mugham (modal music). In 1924, his family moved to Baku. In 1935, he enrolled in the theoretical composition faculty at Baku Conservatory, studying under Uzeyir Hajibeyov and the Latvian-born Leopold Rudolf, a student of Sergei Taneyev. The following year, Hajiyev composed his single movement \\"Symphony No. 1\\", the first symphonic piece ever written by an Azerbaijani composer. This work enabled him to enter Moscow Conservatory in 1938. In Moscow, World War II interrupted his studies and he had to return to Baku. Career After the war, Hajiyev and fellow student Gara Garayev (1918-1982) returned to Moscow and were profoundly influenced by composer Shostakovich. Hajiyev completed \\"Symphony No. 3\\" to graduate in 1947. During his lifetime, Hajiyev composed eight symphonic works plus the heroic-patriotic opera \\"Vatan\\" (Motherland), which he wrote with Gara Garayev in 1944. After the opera's premiere in May 1945, Hajiyev and Garayev were awarded the prestigious Stalin Prize. Hajiyev won a second Stalin Prize in 1952, for his symphonic poem \\"For Peace\\". Hajiyev served briefly as Artistic Director of the Baku Philharmonic Orchestra (1947‚Äì48) and was appointed to the staff of the Azerbaijan State Conservatory. He later served as the Conservatory's Rector (1957-1969) and in 1963 was appointed Professor of Composition. He went on to teach at the Conservatory for more than four decades. His students include well-known musicians such as Agshin Alizade, Dadash Dadashov and song composers Eldar Mansurov and Javanshir Guliyev. It is for his contribution to the development of the symphony in Azerbaijan that Hajiyev will best be remembered. It was to this genre that Hajiyev returned with renewed inspiration in the 1990s, producing a number of works influenced by contemporary events. His last symphonic work entitled, \\"January 20\\", composed in 1991, was dedicated to the victims of Black January (1990), when Soviet troops and tanks killed hundreds of Baku civilians. In 1997, President Heydar Aliyev bestowed upon Hajiyev Azerbaijan's highest recognition, the \\"Azerbaijan Order of Glory\\" on the occasion of his 80th Jubilee, commemorating \\"60 long years of fruitful work which is highly appreciated by the nation and the State\\". In Aliyev's official citation for this award, Hajiyev was praised as a \\"well-known composer, innovator, pedagogue, well-known public figure and model for the new generation of musicians.\\" His music was commended for its \\"deep context, spirit of citizenship and high level of elegance.\\" Personal life Jovdat Hajiyev was married to Amina Dilbazi, well known Azeri ballet-master and folk music dancer.

The earliest mining of coal in the coalfield was in Pocahontas, Virginia in 1883 http://pocahontasva.org/museum.html at Pocahontas Mine No. 1, now on the National Register of Historic Places. Pocahontas Coalfield Centennial Celebration medal The coal seams--Pocahontas No. 3, No. 4, No. 6, and No. 11--are some of the best coal to be found in the world, and are rated at 15,000 Btu/lb (35 MJ/kg). This operation, replete with beehive coke ovens, eventually spawned the Pocahontas Fuel Company, which operated mines in Virginia at Boissevain and Amonate, and in West Virginia at Jenkinjones, Bishop, and Itmann. History Later Pocahontas Fuel Company (formerly Pocahontas Consolidated) was absorbed into Consolidation Coal Company,http://www.nwhs.org/eTAF/NWHS.eTAF.2013_02.web.pdf which still mines coal at Amonate. 1907 Pocahontas Consolidated Stock Certificate The mines at Pocahontas were able to ship coal when the Norfolk & Western Railway bought the New River Railroad and extended a branch line there. As this railroad was extended westward through Mercer and McDowell Counties the coalfield expanded with it. By the mid-1880s the Bramwell area was booming with mines at Coopers and Freeman. Coal mines continued to open through the 1890s as the Norfolk & Western Railroad laid track along Elkhorn Creek and eventually reached Welch. Some of these coal mines/coal camps included Maybeury, Elkhorn, Upland, and Keystone. The coals of the Pocahontas coalfield developed a good reputation, and by 1903, U.S. Steel had set up a subsidiary named U.S. Coal and Coke to mine coal in central McDowell County. The operations centered around Gary, with numbered coal mines/camps surrounding the central coal town of Gary like coal town suburbs. Wilcoe was Gary No. 1, Ream was Gary No. 6, Elbert was Gary No.8, and Venus was Gary No. 10 and Thorpe was No.11. At first the coal was baked in beehive coke ovens at the mine site and shipped to the steel mills as coke (much as U.S. Steel had done in the Connellsville coalfield in Pennsylvania). After 1918 the coal was shipped by rail to the massive coke works at Clairton. The captive mines of U.S. Steel in the Gary area continued to thrive until the 1980s, when they were closed and Gary began an economic decline. The Pocahontas Coalfield continued to thrive through two world wars. The United Mine Workers union gained a foothold in the coalfield after the 1930s. African-Americans from the south flooded the coalfield in search of a better way of life, and to this day McDowell County has the highest percentage of African-American population of any West Virginia county. Immigrants from Poland, Hungary, Italy, and Greece settled in the coal camps and contributed to the remarkable ethnic diversity of the area. Echoes of this diversity are still evident today. In the mid-20th century mines thrived at Capels, Caretta, Coalwood, and Berwind. On January 10, 1940, the Bartley No. 1 Mine explosion killed 91 miners, and subsequently, Havaco No. 9 mine explosion on January 15, 1956 claimed the lives of 15 coal miners. Extraction of the low-volatile coal continued unabated through the energy boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since 1990 this coalfield has been on the decline and outmigration has robbed the area of 75% of its population. (In 1950 McDowell County had a population of approximately 100,000 people, which was reduced to about 22,000 people in the 2010 census.) Yet today there are a few medium to small surface and deep mines still operating.

AWS is used in the United States, Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. It replaces some of the spectrum formerly allocated to Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Service (MMDS), sometimes referred to as Wireless Cable, that existed from 2150 to 2162 MHz. The AWS band uses microwave frequencies in several segments: from 1695 to 2200 MHz. The service is intended to be used by mobile devices such as wireless phones for mobile voice, data, and messaging services. Most manufacturers of smartphone mobile handsets provide versions of their phones that include radios that can communicate using the AWS spectrum. Though initially limited, device support for AWS has steadily improved the longer the band has been in general use, with most high-end and many mid-range handsets supporting it over HSPA, LTE, or both.  Changes  The frequency band covered by the Advanced Wireless Services bands The AWS band defined in 2002 (AWS-1), used microwave frequencies in two segments, from 1710 to 1755 MHz for uplink, and from 2110 to 2155 MHz for downlink. The service is intended to be used by mobile devices such as wireless phones for mobile voice, data, and messaging services. Most manufacturers of smartphone mobile handsets provide versions of their phones that include radios that can communicate using the AWS spectrum. Since for downlink AWS uses a subset of UMTS frequency band I (2100 MHz) some UMTS2100 capable handsets do detect AWS networks but cannot register on them due to the difference in uplink frequencies (1710‚Äì1755 MHz for AWS versus 1920‚Äì1980 MHz for UMTS2100). Though initially limited, device support for AWS has steadily improved the longer the frequency has been in general use, with most high-end and many mid-range handsets supporting it over HSPA, LTE, or both. In Canada, almost all available LTE handsets support AWS as it was the first frequency over which LTE was offered there, and was still the most commonly supported frequency for LTE in Canada as of 2014-08-21. In 2012 the [FCC] released rules for the 'H' block (AWS-2), covering the frequencies 1915-1920 MHz and 1995-2000 MHz. In 2013 they regulated the AWS-3 Block, covering bands 1695-1710 MHz, 1755-1780 MHz and 2155-2180 MHz. In 2012 there was a proposal regarding the AWS-4 Block, which regulated use of 2000-2020 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz. These were initially proposed for use with the Mobile Satellite System (MSS), but later more uses were introduced  Canada  In Canada, Industry Canada held the auction for AWS spectrum in 2008. Freedom Mobile (formerly Wind Mobile) had licensed AWS spectrum in every province, and began offering voice and data services on December 16, 2009. Its Saskatchewan and Manitoba spectrum was later sold off to Sasktel and MTS, respectively. Freedom only operates in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, although they have roaming agreements with Rogers, Telus and Bell at extra cost. Mobilicity also used the AWS spectrum and began offering services in May 2010, operating in similar areas as Wind but with a smaller network footprint. Its AWS network was combined with Rogers when the latter company acquired Mobilicity in 2015. Quebecor licensed AWS spectrum throughout the province of Quebec and began offering service with its Vid√©otron Mobile brand on September 9, 2010. Shaw Communications licensed AWS spectrum in western Canada and northern Ontario, began to build some infrastructure for providing wireless phone service, but subsequently decided to cancel further development and did not launch this service. The licenses were eventually sold to Rogers, with some transferred to Wind. Shaw re-entered the mobile services market when it acquired Wind Mobile in 2016. Halifax-based EastLink obtained licenses in eastern Canada, with a small amount of spectrum bought in Ontario and Alberta, and is currently building up infrastructure to launch mobile phone and data services in Nova Scotia and PEI in 2012. This Service has since launched and is available in numerous markets around Atlantic Canada with roaming through Rogers and Bell. Rogers Wireless, Bell Mobility, Telus Mobility, SaskTel, and Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS) all received licenses for AWS spectrum, which they are now using for their LTE networks. Freedom Mobile has subsequently refarmed some spectrum in their UMTS network and deployed LTE on bands 4, and 66.  United States  In the United States, the service is administered by the Federal Communications Commission. The licenses were broken up into 6 blocks (A-F). Block A consisted of 734 Cellular Market Areas (CMA). Blocks B and C were each divided into 176 Economic Areas (EA), sometimes referred to as BEA by the FCC. Blocks D, E, and F were each broken up into 12 Regional Economic Area Groupings (REAG), sometimes referred to as REA by the FCC. Bidding for this new spectrum started on August 9, 2006 and the majority of the frequency blocks were sold to T-Mobile USA to deploy their 3G wireless network in the United States.

It runs for from Uniontown to the Ohio state line near Darlington, where it connects with Ohio State Route 14. PA 51 is the termination point for Pennsylvania Route 43, Pennsylvania Route 48 and Pennsylvania Route 88. The route is a major connection from Uniontown and the rest of Fayette County to Pittsburgh. The highway is four-lane highway south of Pittsburgh as it passes through Pittsburgh's South Hills, but narrows to a two-lane road through several boroughs along the Ohio River. It becomes four lanes again after passing Chippewa Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania in Beaver County and continues to the Ohio border. In the South Hills, PA 51 (Saw Mill Run Boulevard), along with US 19, is one of the major routes in and out of Pittsburgh, as it provides access to several bridges and tunnels. PA 51 is one of the highways that enters the West End Circle, an intersection in the West End. Route description=Fayette and Westmoreland counties PA 51 begins as Pittsburgh Street in downtown Uniontown at an intersection with U.S. Route 40 Business. As Route 51 heads north, it exits Uniontown and intersects with U.S. Route 119, Uniontown's bypass. North of US 119, PA 51 is a rural, multi-lane divided highway that is also known as Pittsburgh Road. In North Union Township, Route 51 divides for ; the road has a large median that is home to several businesses. It then shifts towards the northwest, continuing as a multi-lane divided highway. In Perry Township, PA 51 intersects Pennsylvania Route 201 at a cloverleaf interchange. North of PA 201, it enters the borough of Perryopolis as Fuller Drive; after leaving the city to the north, PA 51 begins to parallel the Youghiogheny River. Upon entering Westmoreland County, PA 51 intersects the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 981. About northwest of PA 981, it also intersects Interstate 70 at exits 46 A-B to form a full cloverleaf interchange. To the northwest in Sweeneys Crossroads, the road intersects Pennsylvania Route 201 again. PA 51 divides before reaching the county border and also passes by Rostraver Airport. Route 51 only spends seven miles (11 km) in Westmoreland County, all in Rostraver Township. Allegheny and Beaver counties Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania along the Ohio river early depiction of PA 51 headed toward McKees Rocks early 1800s (What is now PA 51 along the Ohio River in the early 1800s looking toward the Point) Upon entering Allegheny County, PA 51 is called Hayden Boulevard, and it meets with Pennsylvania Route 136 at a diamond interchange. Route 51 intersects the southern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 48 in Forward Township before entering the boroughs of Elizabeth and West Elizabeth. In West Elizabeth, after crossing the Monongahela River via the Regis R. Malady Bridge, PA 51 immediately intersects with Pennsylvania Route 837. It then continues towards Jefferson Hills in the northwest, where it meets the northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 43 (Mon-Fayette Expressway) at exit 54. PA 43 is expected to extend further north of PA 51. Northwest of PA 43, PA 51 becomes Clairton Boulevard. In Pleasant Hills and West Mifflin, PA 51 passes by the former Century III Mall, which was formerly one of the largest malls in the area. The stretch of PA 51/Clairton Blvd. continues through Baldwin Borough, Whitehall, and Brentwood. At the border of Brentwood and Overbrook, PA 51 becomes Saw Mill Run Boulevard. At the southern tip of Pittsburgh, PA 51 intersects the northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 88 before continuing towards the north as Saw Mill Run Blvd. It meets with the Liberty Tunnel connector, which leads towards the Liberty Bridge and Interstate 579; PA 51 also begins a concurrency with U.S. Route 19 Truck at this junction. The US 19 Truck/PA 51 concurrency ends when US 19 TRK joins Interstate 376, U.S. Route 22, and U.S. Route 30 at exit 5. At this point, PA 51 begins a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 19 through the West End Bypass, a short expressway in Pittsburgh's West End section. The concurrency ends as US 19 crosses the Ohio River on the West End Bridge while PA 51 turns left, heading toward McKees Rocks to the northwest as West Carson Street, paralleling the Ohio River. Entering McKees Rocks, it makes a 90 degree turn to become Locust Street, then makes another turn to become Charties Avenue, and makes a final turn towards the northwest to become Island Avenue. In Stowe Township, PA 51 becomes Robinson Boulevard (formerly Fleming Park Rd.) and passes south of Neville Island on the Ohio River. After a couple of S-curves, Route 51 becomes Coraopolis Road and intersects Interstate 79 at exit 64. It becomes State Avenue in Coraopolis before dividing into two one-way streets called 4th and 5th Avenues. North of Coraopolis, PA 51 continues to parallel the Ohio River as University Boulevard in Moon Township. It then becomes Stoops Ferry Road and passes through Crescent Township on McGovern Boulevard before entering Beaver County. The route spends 36 miles in Allegheny County. PA 51 in northwestern Beaver County At the Beaver County line, PA 51 intersects the eastern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 151. North of PA 151, Route 51 enters South Heights as Jordan Street. The route extends past the Ambridge-Aliquippa bridge, through the city of Aliquippa and West Aliquippa. Farther to the north, the highway heads towards the north as Constitution Boulevard entering Monaca as Beaver and Pennsylvania Avenues before making a 90-degree turn towards the north. Route 51 crosses the Ohio River on the Monaca-East Rochester Bridge, entering the borough of East Rochester. It makes a 90-degree turn to the west to begin a concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 65. In Rochester, PA 51/PA 65 meet with Pennsylvania Route 18; the concurrency ends in downtown Rochester, when PA 51 begins a concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 68. PA 51/PA 68 cross the Beaver River on the Beaver Bridge. In Bridgewater, the PA 51/PA 68 concurrency ends when Route 51 makes a 45-degree turn towards the northwest and continues towards the northwest as Constitution Boulevard. In Chippewa Township, it intersects Interstate 376 (James E. Ross Highway) at exit 31. Northwest of I-376, Route 51 intersects the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 588 and Pennsylvania Route 251. In South Beaver Township, PA 51 intersects Pennsylvania Route 168 and continues towards the northwest as Constitution Boulevard. Pennsylvania Route 51 terminates (ends) at the Ohio state line; in Ohio, it continues as Ohio State Route 14. History Route 51 was first signed in 1927. The north section was signed first, followed by the section between Pittsburgh and Uniontown. Major construction projects included a bypass of Perryopolis built in 1950, the West End Bypass in Pittsburgh that was completed in 1953, and the interchange at the southern portal of the Liberty Tunnels in Pittsburgh. Before the turnpikes were built, Route 51, alongside Ohio State Route 14, served as the main corridor connecting Pittsburgh and Cleveland. The Saw Mill Run Boulevard section of the highway was the first direct connection between Pittsburgh and the South Hills once the Liberty Tunnel was completed. It significantly decreased the driving time to Pittsburgh from the cities of Clairton, Duquesne, McKeesport. Improvements are planned at the intersection with PA 88 south of Pittsburgh, where bottlenecks occur regularly. Other improvements planned include new interchanges at the Liberty Tunnel and West End Bridge (West End Circle), a center median for the rest of Saw Mill Run Boulevard, and an improved intersection with Woodruff Street. Saw Mill Run Expressway (canceled) The Saw Mill Run Expressway was a highway proposed for the South Hills. It would have been built on the same right-of-way as Saw Mill Run Boulevard. In 1964, while designated as \\"the worst bottleneck in Western Pennsylvania,\\" a plan was made to turn the crowded highway into an expressway. The plan was proposed to the Department of Highways and included a renovation of the Liberty Tunnel, several widening projects, new turning lanes, and a central median. The plan would have required cooperation from the surrounding communities. The finished product was to include a limited access expressway from Overbrook to the West End. It would have been twice the width of the current highway and had a total cost of nearly $150 million. Interest in the expressway declined once the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission expressed concerns about business along the corridor, and the project was dropped in 1973. Major intersectionsPA 51 Truck Pennsylvania Route 51 Truck (PA 51 Truck) is a truck route of PA 51 that bypasses the weight-restricted Regis R. Malady Bridge over the Monongahela River between Elizabeth and West Elizabeth, on which trucks over 32 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows McKeesport Road, Lincoln Boulevard, Glassport-Elizabeth Road, the Clairton-Glassport Bridge over the Monongahela River, and PA 837. Former Pennsylvania Route 51 Truck (PA 51 Truck) was a truck route in the Pittsburgh suburb of Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. The truck designation was not intended for vehicles already on PA 51, but for those entering the highway southbound. A cloverleaf has been established to direct traffic between Elizabeth's main street (known as Center Ave and McKeesport Road on different ends of town), but its narrow and winding design makes it difficult for trucks to access Route 51 southbound. As a result, they were directed to enter onto Route 51 northbound, cross the bridge over the Monongahela River, and use a special u-turn exit to reach southbound lanes of travel. This truck route was removed after a weight limit was imposed on the Regis R. Malady Bridge over the Monongahela River.

The jetty's construction commenced in 1864 and the first section was opened in 1865. The jetty was extended numerous times until the 1960s, ultimately reaching a length of . The last commercial vessel called at the jetty in 1971 and the jetty was closed the following year. It passed into the control of Busselton Shire and has been gradually restored and improved since. The jetty has survived Cyclone Alby in 1978, borers, weathering, several fires, and the threat of demolition, to have become a major regional tourist attraction. The jetty features a rail line along its length, a relic of the railway line into Busselton from Bunbury. The line now carries tourists along the jetty to an underwater observatory, one of only six natural aquariums in the world, which opened to the public in 2003. A waterslide was built around a lighthouse structure next to the landward end of the jetty in 1981; it remained operating until 2011. On 9 February 2006, the Queen's Baton Relay passed through Busselton. The baton was taken along the Busselton Jetty and then taken underwater by a scuba diver. The baton passed by the Underwater Observatory during its swim to allow the media to view the event.  Early history  In 1839 Governor Hutt appointed \\"the place in Geographe Bay opposite the Settlement at The Vasse to be the legal place for the loading and unloading of goods\\". Construction of the jetty ‚Äì originally known as the Vasse Jetty ‚Äì commenced in 1864 after persistent pressure by settlers, among others timber merchant Henry Yelverton and magistrate Joseph Strelley Harris; Yelverton's company was awarded the tender for construction. In 1865 the first section, approximately 176 metres, of the jetty became available for ships to moor.Busselton Jetty, 1865-1989.Newsletter (Busselton Historical Society), Jan. 1990, p.1-2. In 1875 an additional 143 metres was added to the original structure, as over 10 years' accumulation of drift sands had made the water too shallow for mooring. The jetty was continually extended until the 1960s when it reached its current length of . Fires on the jetty were commonplace, with some attributed to fishermen carelessly disposing of burning cigarettes, dropping lit matches or to sparks falling from the train's fire box. Closure Even while the port was operating commercially, maintenance costs were controversial. The last commercial ship visited the jetty on 17 October 1971. On 21 July 1972, the jetty was closed to shipping by Governor's Proclamation in the Western Australian Government Gazette after more than a century of use. Once closed, government maintenance of the jetty ceased and it began to deteriorate, suffering attack by wood borers, rot and the occasional fire. After Cyclone Alby On 4 April 1978, Cyclone Alby swept south down the Western Australian coast from the North-West (a rare occurrence) and destroyed a large part of the shore end of the jetty. Subsequently, townspeople banded together to try to save the jetty and eventually persuaded the State Government and the Shire Council to provide some much needed funds for repair.Busselton Jetty from the air Rebuilding the timber jetty proved expensive and funds soon ran out. The Jetty Preservation Society, formed in 1987, resorted to community fund-raising. By 2001, the Committee had raised just A$14,000 ‚Äî a rate of A$1,000 per year. In December 1999, a fire burnt 65 metres of jetty to the water-line incurring damage totaling $900,000.Storrie, Ann: \\"Beneath The Busselton Jetty\\"There had been earlier fires, but not as damaging see ‚Äì A boatshed-style Interpretive Centre opened on the jetty in April 2001 and is located 50 m offshore. The Interpretive Centre gives visitors a glimpse into the jetty's past and its future. In 2001, a new community-development Non-Government Organization (NGO), named \\"The Busselton Challenge\\", assisted the Committee in designing and executing a new fund- raising project that raised A$220,000 in just six months ‚Äî 440 times the previous rate of fund-raising. Further storm damage occurred in 2004,Busselton jetty badly damaged in a storm on 21 July 2004. Reel talk, August 2004, p.14, but the project continued. The jetty was re-positioned as an important state and national resource, enabling the Committee to attract funding for a A$27 million refurbishment project and enter the jetty into the State Register of Heritage Places, thereby securing its future. The refurbishment project was completed in 2011 and the pier and railway were reopened to the public. In 2017 the train was replaced with a solar-powered electric vehicle. Federal government funding for a new discovery centre, along with a glasshouse village, was announced in 2019. Underwater observatory The observatory was opened on 13 December 2003 at a cost of A$3.6 million. The underwater observatory is located 1.8 km from shore ‚Äì almost at the end of the Busselton Jetty ‚Äì and can accommodate up to 40 people at a time in its 9.5 m diameter observation chamber. Descending 8 metres below sea level, visitors can view the corals and fish life through eleven viewing windows.  Waterslide  In 1981, a waterslide opened adjacent to the landward end of the Busselton jetty. It was built wrapping around the existing lighthouse tower and was driven by pumped seawater. In 2011, the land which was occupied by the waterslide and associated amusement park attractions was re-purchased by the City of Busselton and the slide was shut down. The lighthouse was eventually demolished in 2015.  Memorial plaques  Along one side of a section of the jetty are a number of memorial plaques, commemorating people whose ashes have been scattered from the jetty. In February 2012 the Busselton Council limited the placement of such plaques to \\"exceptional circumstances\\", for people who had made significant contributions to or associated with the jetty.

It is notable for being sleeveless, the arms emerging from armholes beneath a cape. It has become associated with the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes.  History  The garment began in the 1850s as the Inverness coat, an outer-coat with sleeves covered by a long cape, reaching the length of the sleeve. By the 1870s, the cape was divided in two, and a small \\"capelet\\"-like \\"wing\\" on each side was sewn into the side seams, not taken across the back. In the 1880s, the sleeves were removed entirely, and the armholes were cut away beneath the cape to form the Inverness cape. The fronts of the coat may be finished in either of two styles: in one, the more formal, the topcoat is finished with short lapels and the capes are set back behind them., fig. 29 In another style, there are no lapels. A simple fall collar with a tall stand is used, the capes buttoning across. These were also favoured for less formal wear, particularly by coachmen and cab drivers, who needed free movement of their arms. Indeed, this style is usually called a \\"coachman's cape.\\" The Inverness cape is a water-repellent garment. The commonly held image of the cape as worn by Holmes is one made of tweed, specifically in a grey houndstooth pattern. However, more modest capes, made of nylon or twill-weave fabrics and usually black in colour, are commonly used by members of pipe bands.  Highland dress  An Inverness cape worn with Highland dress, 2007 Tacoma Highland Games Even though a wide variety of coats, overcoats, and rain gear are worn with Highland dress to deal with inclement weather, the Inverness cape has come to be almost universally adopted for rainy weather by pipe bands the world over, and many other kilt wearers also find it to be the preferable garment for such conditions. Unlike most raincoats or other conventional overcoats, the Inverness cape has no sleeves. Instead, it has wide-cut armholes in the sides to accommodate the arms. This enables the wearer to access a sporran without unbuttoning and opening up the cape. The opening in the side is covered by a short cape, which can be buttoned up in the front.  In popular culture  Statue of Sherlock Holmes in an Inverness cape and deerstalker, at Conan Doyle's birthplace in Edinburgh Arguably the most famous example in fiction, Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective Sherlock Holmes is often associated with the Inverness cape. In the Holmes novels, Holmes is described as wearing an Ulster. Holmes's distinctive look, which was usually complemented with a deerstalker cap and a calabash pipe, is a composite of images, originally credited to illustrator Sidney Paget. But as adapted to the stage by the actor-playwright William Gillette, Holmes did not wear a cape-coat at all, and the origin of the calabash pipe is something of a mystery, although it might have had something to do with Gillette's introduction of a full-bend briar pipe for his performances. Paget had depicted Holmes as smoking straight pipes, exclusively. Be that as it might, the cape-coat, the deerstalker, and the calabash pipe were already associated with Holmes by the 1930s, chiefly in the United States, but the image became definitive with the first two films in which Basil Rathbone appeared on-screen as Holmes, produced for 20th Century Fox in 1939. August Derleth's Solar Pons, essentially Sherlock Holmes with a different name and living in Praed Street in the 1920s, also wears an Inverness. Inverness capes are worn by characters in many Western and Spaghetti Western films, such as Lee Van Cleef's character in For a Few Dollars More and Gianni Garko in the Sartana series. In the 1970s of the long- running series Doctor Who, the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee), frequently wore an Inverness cape over his dandy suits. The vampire Barnabas Collins (as portrayed by actor Jonathan Frid) wore an Inverness cape on the cult classic Gothic soap opera Dark Shadows. The 2001 film adaptation of the absurdist play Waiting for Godot has landlord Pozzo (played by Alan Stanford) wearing an Inverness cape, symbolising the Protestant Ascendancy landlords of Ireland. Still worn in the United Kingdom, the Inverness cape is often made of heavy Harris tweed of plaid and checked designs. It is usually worn for country wear. Lighter weight black cape-coats are more associated with formal evening attire. Popular urban fantasy hero Harry Dresden of The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher replaced his trademark duster with an Inverness coat in Cold Days, the 14th book of the series. Steampunk fashion has revived the wearing of the Inverness cape to a limited extent.

The architect was Francis S. Swales. The hotel closed in 1939, when an arrangement was made with rival Canadian National Railway (CNR) to jointly operate CNR's new hotel, located two blocks away. That hotel, which took over the name Hotel Vancouver, is still operating today. The 1916 CPR building survived until 1949 when it was demolished by the Eaton's department store chain. Famous Guests Many famous people stayed at this hotel, including Winston Churchill, Sarah Bernhardt, Babe Ruth, Ethel Barrymore, and Anna Pavlova. It was also much loved by the people of Vancouver, who made its rooftop dining room and dance floor, the Panorama Roof, a favourite place for a night out. Structure and Location The structure was one of the triumvirate of large, ornate buildings which anchored the centre of town at Georgia and Granville streets: the Hudson Bay Store, Birks Building, and Hotel Vancouver. Only the Hudson Bay store remains of those three jewels of the city's golden age of Edwardian architecture. Also attached to the hotel and built by the CPR was the Vancouver Opera House, later an Orpheum theatre, the city's first. It had become the Lyric Theatre by the time it was demolished to make way for the construction of Pacific Centre. The site is one of the highest points in the downtown peninsula, good for an imposing building, a fact not lost on the Canadian Pacific. The upstart Canadian Northern wanted to impress the town to further its rivalry with the Canadian Pacific. To this end, the east side of False Creek was filled in to expand rail yards and situate a Beaux Arts railway station. Once flanked by a much more elaborate Great Northern station, since demolished, the Pacific Central Station still stands today. In an agreement with the city, the Canadian Northern promised to build a new hotel. However, the First World War and the insolvency of the Canadian Northern Railway delayed the start of the project; the successor Canadian National began construction in 1928. The Great Depression delayed the opening of the third Hotel Vancouver until 1939. Money to complete the hotel was finally provided by the Canadian government in 1937 as an unemployment relief projet in the dark days of the Depression. Fearing the market was not large enough for competing hotels, the railways agreed to a joint CP-CN hotel as a condition of the completion. World War II During the Second World War, the second Hotel Vancouver was used as a barracks. The building was boarded up and placed under guard at the end of the war, a time when returning veterans were having difficulty finding housing. In January 1946 thirty-five veterans, unimpeded by Army sentries, took over the vacant hotel and announced the building was now veterans housing. They organized themselves and soon were housing approximately 1,000 veterans and some spouses. The building was used by the veterans until 1948 and torn down a year later. The block became a parking lot until 1969. The Pacific Centre, including the TD Tower and the main Vancouver Eaton's Store (now Nordstrom), was constructed between 1969 and 1973 and stands on the site today. Media depictions The hotel was recreated in virtual form in the 2014 interactive work Circa 1948.

Washington. The tunnels were vital in the expansion of the South Hills suburbs by providing a direct route to the city, eliminating the time-consuming task of navigating around or over Mt. Washington and its inclines. Opening in 1924, the Liberty Tunnels are the longest automobile tunnel in the City of Pittsburgh.  Design  The tunnels were designed by Amos D. Neeld, who would also supervise the construction of the adjoining Liberty Bridge, which gives travelers a way to cross the Monongahela River after passing through the tunnels. The design was two vertical wall horseshoe profile tunnels, each consisting of two lanes of traffic and a sidewalk. The sidewalks, being minimally used and in disrepair, were removed during a renovation in the 1970s in order to widen and increase the height of the traffic lanes.  Proposed alternatives  Prior to the construction of the Liberty Tunnels, many other projects were proposed. One plan, from engineer W. M. Donley, did not involve constructing tunnels, but called for a deep cut through the mountain. This would eliminate the need for a tunnel, but the pitch was rejected. Many residents wanted tunnels to be built in Shalerville. Later in 1959, the Fort Pitt Tunnels were constructed very near this proposed area. Similarly, other residents wanted tunnels to be built in a valley behind Mt. Washington that led to Dormont and Mt. Lebanon. They would follow a low line to exit at Saw Mill Run. This was known as the Bell Tavern plan, which was modified to create the Liberty Tunnels. The final plan for the tunnels shared the southern Bell Tavern portal, but followed a higher line to emerge on the north face of Mt. Washington. This plan required the construction of a new bridge, which was to become the Liberty Bridge.  Construction  Booth and Flinn, Ltd. were awarded the contract to build the new tunnels in January 1919, and construction began shortly thereafter. On May 11, 1922, the boring of the tunnels was complete and in January 1924, the $6 million ($ in present dollars) Liberty Tunnels were opened to traffic. However, the tunnels were not yet complete and lacked a major component necessary to the project: ventilation.  Ventilation  There was not yet a ventilation system when the tunnels opened, but authorities decided the flow of traffic would allow for a natural draft of ventilation. On May 10, 1924, a traffic jam which occurred due to a Pittsburgh Street Railway Company strike, causing vehicles to be stopped, idling in the tunnels. Several motorists passed out from the fumes emitted from the exhaust of the congested vehicles.https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/thedigs/2016/09/22/panic- deadly-fumes-inside-the-liberty-tunnels For the safety of motorists, the number of vehicles permitted through the tunnels was regulated until a ventilation system was installed.https://pittsburghquarterly.com/pq-people- opinion/pq-history/item/1214-once-upon-a-tunnel.html With help from the U.S. Bureau of Mines, tunnel engineers designed a system to ventilate the tunnels to accommodate the high traffic flow. In 1928, construction of four vertical shafts was completed to continuously provide fresh air to the tunnels. A plant located on top on the mountain was constructed to pump the fresh air through the shafts, which also tower above the plant. After the ventilation system was put into service, the traffic restrictions were lifted.  Liberty Bridge  Following the completion of the Liberty Tunnels, the Liberty Bridge was completed and linked to the tunnels on March 27, 1928. The bridge and tunnel combination gave motorists and pedestrians a direct route to the city without traveling over or around Mt. Washington.

Besides studies of the Christian religion, he wrote numerous other books, including political satire, comedy, fiction, science fiction, plays and poetry. He died in London on 8 October 1929. Early career Begbie was born in 1871, the fifth son of Mars Hamilton Begbie, rector of Fornham St Martin, Suffolk. Though initially a farmer, Begbie moved to London and worked for the Daily Chronicle and later the Globe. In addition to children's literature, he wrote popular works of poetry. He was a close friend of journalist Arthur Mee.John Hammerton(1946) Child of Wonder: An Intimate Biography of Arthur Mee When Mee embarked on his Children's Encyclop√¶dia in its initial fortnightly serial form, he gave to Begbie the task of writing a series on \\"Bible Stories\\".Michael Tracy (2008), The World of the Edwardian Child, as seen in Arthur Mee's \\"Children's Encyclop√¶dia\\", 1908‚Äì1910. At the outbreak of World War I Begbie wrote a number of recruiting poems and visited America as behalf of his paper. Religious views Begbie had a strong religious bent: he was involved in the Oxford Group (which later became Moral Re-Armament) and with the Salvation Army. His concern with social reform appeared strongly in his book The Little that is Good (1917), where he wrote about charitable work among the poor of London. He raised large sums of money for East End charities. Begbie might be described as a Broad Church Anglican, who was interested in the ways in which modern science seemed to cast doubt on materialism by showing matter was more complicated than previously believed. He was hostile to Anglo-Catholic Ritualism and to Roman Catholicism; several pre-First World War novels portray Ritualists as sinister and dishonest crypto-Catholic conspirators. His 1914 book The Lady Next Door, however, supports Irish home rule and gives an idealised portrayal of Catholicism in Ireland as a genuinely popular religion. His hostile view of urban industrial society in Belfast was criticised by many Ulster Unionists including the writer St. John Ervine.Reprint of Harold Begbie The Lady Next Door (University College Dublin Press, 2006) with introduction by Patrick Maume. In the preface to the American edition of his book The Glass of Fashion (1921), Begbie attacked Darwinism. However, he was not anti-evolution. In his book The Proof of God (1914), he endorsed theistic evolution.Branch, Glenn. \\"A Gentleman with a Duster, Part 1\\". NCSE. Retrieved 7 August 2018. Political views He acted as ghostwriter for the memoir of the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton. In 1902 and 1903, Begbie, together with J. Stafford Ransome and M.H. Temple wrote, under the pseudonym Caroline Lewis, two parodies based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, entitled Clara in Blunderland and Lost in Blunderland. These novels deal with British frustration and anger about the Boer War and with Britain's political leadership at the time. By 1916, dismayed by the attacks being made on Lord Haldane by Leopold Maxse in the National Review, he began to question the government's domestic policy. In 1917, he publicly defended the rights of pacifists and conscientious objectors to oppose the war. Begbie strongly defended the reality of the alleged apparition of the Angels of Mons and attacked Arthur Machen for claiming they derived from his story \\"The Bowmen\\". Begbie printed numerous accounts of the \\"Angels\\" in his book On the Side of the Angels (1915) but these are generally anonymous, second-hand or otherwise unverifiable. However, war regulations prevented naming of military personnel. Before the First World War Begbie was an outspoken Liberal social reformist, but he moved rapidly to the right in the post-war period. In a series of books written under the pseudonym \\"Gentleman with a Duster\\", he denounced sexually suggestive literature (such as the early plays of No√´l Coward), lamented the precarious economic state of the middle classes and the prospective disintegration of the British Empire, and called for a strong hand against left-wing subversives even if this meant restricting some traditional British liberties. Works Besides the \\"Gentleman with a Duster\\" books, Begbie wrote Broken Earthware, Other Sheep, In the Hands of the Potter, and Life of General Booth, a book about William Booth. He also wrote a novel, The Great World, which was published in September 1925 by Mills & Boon. * The Political Struwwelpeter, 1898 * The Story of Baden-Powell: 'The Wolf That Never Sleeps', 1900 * Bundy in the Greenwood, 1902 * Clara in Blunderland, 1902 (New edition 2010, ) * Lost in Blunderland, 1903 (New edition 2010, ) * On the Side of the Angels, 1915 * The life of William Booth, the Founder of the Salvation Army, 1920 * The Bed-Book of Happiness, 1914 * The Proof of God, 1914 * The Vindication of Great Britain, 1916 * Twice Born Men: A Clinic in Regeneration (A Footnote in Narrative to Professor William James's 'Varieties of Religious Experience'), 1909 * The Mirrors of Downing Street: Some Political Reflections by a Gentleman with a Duster, 1921 * The Glass Of Fashion: Some Social Reflections by A Gentleman With A Duster, 1921 (G.

He started his professional football career with Hartlepool United in 2000. After 60 appearances in three years with Hartlepool & a player of the year award, Sharp fell out of favour at Hartlepool and moved to Scottish club Falkirk on a free transfer in 2003.

The idea is that some types of learning require more cognitive processing than others, but also have more generalized benefits. In Bloom's taxonomy, for example, skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis (creation of new knowledge) are thought to be of a higher order than the learning of facts and concepts which requires different learning and teaching methods. Higher-order thinking involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. Higher-order thinking is more difficult to learn or teach but also more valuable because such skills are more likely to be usable in novel situations (i.e., situations other than those in which the skill was learned). Education reform It is a notion that students must master the lower level skills before they can engage in higher-order thinking. However, the United States National Research Council objected to this line of reasoning, saying that cognitive research challenges that assumption, and that higher-order thinking is important even in elementary school. Including higher-order thinking skills in educational aims and objectives is a very common feature of standards-based education reform. Advocates of traditional education object to elevating HOTS above direct instruction of basic skills. Many forms of education reform, such as inquiry- based science, reform mathematics and whole language emphasize HOTS to solve problems and learn, sometimes deliberately omitting direct instruction of traditional methods, facts, or knowledge. HOTS assumes standards based assessments that use open-response items instead of multiple-choice questions, and hence require higher-order analysis and writing. Critics of standards based assessments point out that this style of testing is even more difficult for students who are behind academically. Indeed, while minorities may lag by 10 to 25 points on standardized percentile rankings, the failure rates of minorities are two to four times the best scoring groups on tests like the WASL. It is debated whether it is correct to raise the importance of teaching process over content. The Republican Party of Texas expressed their opposition to the teaching of certain HOTS by including the following item in their 2012 Party Platform: > \\"Knowledge-Based Education ‚Äì We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking > Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar > programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) > (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose > of challenging the student's fixed beliefs and undermining parental > authority.\\" However, the final wording of this item was evidently a \\"mistake\\" according to Republican Party of Texas Communications Director Chris Elam who said, in an interview with Talking Points Memo, that the plank should not have included the phrase \\"critical thinking skills\\" and it was not the intent of the subcommittee to indicate that the RPT was opposed to critical thinking skills. When asked to clarify the meaning of the item he said, \\"I think the intent is that the Republican Party is opposed to the values clarification method that serves the purpose of challenging students beliefs and undermine parental authority\\".

He served as a congressman, mayor, and governor, but in April 2009, stepped down as Mayor of Maracaibo when he was charged with corruption in Venezuela and fled to Peru. Rosales denies the charges, and was granted political asylum in Peru. Political background Rosales began his political career as a youth leader of the political party, Acci√≥n Democr√°tica (AD), described by the BBC as \\"one of the two parties that dominated Venezuelan politics for most of the second half of the 20th Century\\". In 2000 he founded \\"his own centre-left party which he called Un Nuevo Tiempo\\" (A New Era); he describes \\"himself as a social democrat\\". Rosales served as a congressman in the Zulia Legislative Assembly (1983‚Äì1994), Mayor of Maracaibo (1996‚Äì2000)‚ÄîVenezuela's second-largest city, in Zulia, Venezuela's wealthiest state‚Äîand Governor of Zulia for two terms (2000‚Äì2004 and 2004‚Äì2008). Rosales was accused of participating in the 2002 \\"attempt to oust the president\\"; according to the BBC, \\"government supporters accuse him of taking part in a short-lived coup ...\\". Rosales signed the Carmona Decree‚Äîa document drawn up on the day following the Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002, which saw the temporary removal of President Ch√°vez. He declared that he signed during a \\"moment of confusion\\" after \\"Chavez's resignation, although [Chavez] later denied [the resignation]\\", and that he signed his attendance at a meeting he was urgently requested to attend. Presidential bid Rosales was defeated by Chavez in the December 2006 Venezuelan election to choose a president for the six-year term beginning in January 2007. A primary election organized by Sumate had been scheduled for August 2006, but was cancelled when other presidential opposition candidates agreed to withdraw from the race and support Rosales. As \\"one of only two governors\\" opposed to Chavez, Rosales united the opposition, representing a broad coalition of parties and organizations opposed to Hugo Ch√°vez. According to the BBC, \\"critics ... describe him as uncharismatic\\". Rosales during electoral campaign, August 2006 Rosales' platform was based on what he called \\"democracy and social justice\\" and crime; according to the BBC, \\"He has accused Mr Chavez of wasting the country's oil wealth on friendly governments abroad and of trying to introduce Cuban-style communism.\\" Rosales said that the backbone of his government program would be the social arena, saying it would be a \\"sound and well defined\\" program, including a \\"fair allocation of oil revenues by means of two axes - minimum wage for all unemployed and direct contribution to the underprivileged\\". He stated that Ch√°vez was vulnerable on his \\"massive foreign aid programs, government-approved takeovers of land and buildings, and the perception that crime is increasing\\". Rosales said, \\"We will distribute land to the peasants, but we will buy it in such a way as to respect the principle of private property, just as we will respect those of human rights and social justice.\\" His platform would halt oil giveaways, \\"including sales of discounted oil to Cuba, until Venezuela reduced its high poverty rate.\\" Rosales accused Ch√°vez of \\"overspending on a military buildup\\" and pledged \\"to use Venezuela's oil wealth to help the poor and improve education and health care\\", ridiculing Ch√°vez's \\"claims of a possible war with the U.S.\\" and saying, \\"Venezuela's real war should be against rampant street crime.\\" The New York Times said, \\"Rosales has focused on other themes, including fierce criticism of the alliances Mr. Ch√°vez has made with countries on the fringes of American influence, like Iran and Cuba. But his campaign's predominant message is that Mr. Ch√°vez, despite his socialist talk, has failed to deliver oil wealth to the poor.\\" The New York Times also said Rosales \\"has been pounding the crime issue, questioning why murders have surged since Mr. Ch√°vez entered office\\", and saying Chavez's \\"confrontational style\\" was \\"feeding the crime epidemic\\". Incumbent president Hugo Ch√°vez was re-elected with 62.87% of the vote. Indictments Rosales was re-elected Mayor of Maracaibo in the 2008 Venezuelan regional elections; according to the BBC, in \\"the campaign, Mr Chavez railed against him, threatening him with prison and accusing him of corruption and plotting to assassinate him\\". According to USA Today, Rosales characterized the allegations as an \\"electoral ploy to distract Venezuelans from pressing problems such as double-digit inflation and rampant crime\\". Rosales was charged by the Venezuelan Attorney General with corruption in late 2008, accused of \\"misusing public funds\\" during his term as Governor of Zulia‚Äîcharges which he denies. Prosecutors say he obtained $60,000 illicitly while he was governor. According to Rosales, a 2002‚Äì2004 investigation that \\"was closed for lack of evidence\\" was \\"'suddenly reopened by orders from above,' alluding to Chavez\\". Rosales went into hiding in March 2009 when charges were filed, and failed to appear in court in April. On 22 April it was reported that he had sought political asylum in Peru. Interpol issued a \\"red notice\\" (requesting international cooperation in the apprehension of a suspect, with a view to enabling extradition proceedings) at Venezuela's request. According to CNN, \\"[o]ne of Rosales' lawyers noted that Chavez said publicly in October 2008, before Rosales was charged, that he wanted the mayor in prison.\\" Rosales' supporters characterized the charges as a \\"political witch hunt\\". According to the BBC, \\"His decision to leave Venezuela is the latest development in a long-running feud with Mr Chavez.\\" Venezuelan authorities deny that the charges are politically motivated. On April 28, 2009, Venezuela withdrew its ambassador to Lima in response to Peru's decision to grant Rosales political asylum. Peruvian officials said the decision was part of their \\"long-standing commitment to international law\\"; Venezuelan officials called it a \\"mockery of international law, a strong blow to the fight against corruption and an offence to the people of Venezuela\\", saying that Rosales should have been detained and extradited. The newspaper El Nuevo Herald reported in 2009 about allegations by Geovanny Vel√°squez Zambrano, a member of the Colombian paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia serving a 40-year prison term for paramilitary massacres, that Rosales met with Colombian paramilitaries in 1999 to plot the assassination of Ch√°vez. Zambrano claims that he attended two meetings with Morales, in which Morales offered him and his subordinates US$25 million to kill Ch√°vez. Rosales denies these allegations, saying they are a lie and that his passport documents that he was in Aruba during the time of the alleged meetings, saying \\"The only plan in which I have been involved to 'do away with' Chavez has been the electoral plan\\". Venezuela's Attorney General announced an investigation of these allegations in October 2009. The 2009 Human Rights Watch report mentions Rosales as an example of political persecution, questioning the judicial procedures against him. Manuel Rosales arrives to Venezuela on 15th of October 2015 In October 2015, Rosales announced that he would be returning to Venezuela. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz reported that a warrant had been issued for Rosale's arrest, upon his arriving in the country. On October 15, 2015, Rosales was arrested in Maracaibo after arriving from Aruba and was sentenced to 13 years and 9 months in prison soon after. In October, 2016, Rosales' sentence was commuted to house arrest and he was released 2 months later on December 31. Personal  Rosales was a teacher before moving into public service. He was a co-founder of Universidad Nacional Experimental Sur del Lago, and received numerous distinctions and honors for his public service. He is married to Eveling Trejo de Rosales; they have ten children (Hender Manuel, Jenny, Manuel Alejandro, Marenel, Marebeth, Carlos Manuel, Manuel Andr√©s, Alejandra, and Aleida).

The band pushed the musical boundaries of the local thrash metal scene and were one of the earliest bands to play what later came to be known as death metal. The group were also responsible for the foundation of Australia's biggest metal festival, Metal for the Brain.  History  Armoured Angel was formed in 1982 as Metal Asylum by Lucy (bass) and Rowan Powell (guitars). The band was renamed Armoured Angel in 1984, with drummer Dave Davis and vocalist Rick Wayy completing the lineup. After recording a demo in 1985 titled Baptism in Blood, Powell and Wayy were replaced by Tony Sheaffe and Russell Ruszinski, respectively. Armoured Angel underwent another line-up change in 1986, reforming as a trio with Lucy and brothers Joel Green (drums, vocals) and Matt Green (guitar). With this line-up, the band recorded a second demo titled Wings of Death in Easter 1989 which garnered a strong cult fanbase. A third demo titled Communion was released in 1990. An east coast tour of Australia followed, plus a re-release of Wings of Death on English record label CCG in 1991. In 1991, Joel Green organised the Metal for the Brain festival as a benefit concert for his close friend Alec Hurley, who had been savagely beaten in an assault in 1990 and left severely brain-damaged and permanently disabled. The group continued to organise the annual festival until 1996. Armoured Angel released their first EP, Stigmartyr in 1992 through Id records, a development arm of Polygram. The band supported Morbid Angel on their Australian tour that same year. Australian heavy metal magazine Hot Metal awarded a five out of five review for the EP. In January 1993, the band appeared at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney and supported Carcass and Bolt Thrower on their respective Australian tours. The band's second EP Mysterium was released in 1994, and a short tour of the UK and a headlining show in Germany followed in 1995. After returning to Australia, Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke began production of the band's first full-length release in Sydney's Powerhouse Studios in 1996. That same year, Armoured Angel featured at the Melbourne leg of the Big Day Out festival tour. The band split shortly after and the album was never released. Lucy reformed Armoured Angel in 1998 with guitarist/vocalist Yuri Ward of fellow Canberra act Psychrist and drummer Steven Luff. In early 1999, the full-length album Angel of the Sixth Order was released on Sydney's Warhead Records. This incarnation of Armoured Angel was short-lived, with the band splitting again in 1999 after the closure of Warhead Records and the departure of Luff.  Aftermath  After Armoured Angel's disbandment, Lucy performed a short stint in Canberra death metal band Reign of Terror. Yuri Ward continued work with Psychrist, also performing as a live member of Lord Kaos, and later formed death/thrash metallers Kill for Satan. Joel Green currently performs for doom metallers Witchskull. Lucy and the Green brothers reunited in late 2006 to remaster their back catalogue, including a 1996 pre-production demo of the band's shelved album. Hymns of Hate, a compilation album featuring all of the 1987-1996 line-up's material was released in 2013.

Proponents claim the Trager approach helps release deep-seated physical and mental patterns and facilitates deep relaxation, increased physical mobility, and mental clarity.Trivieri, Larry, and John W. Anderson. Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide. Berkeley, Calif: Celestial Arts, 2002. The founder, Milton Trager, called his work Psychophysical Integration. He was an athlete, dancer, and bodybuilder. He began doing bodywork with no training and later worked under a variety of practitioner licenses, including an MD earned in Mexico followed by 2 years residency in psychiatry. Trager wanted western medicine to accept his proposed mind-body connection in treating challenging conditions such as postpolio, Parkinson's, and other neuromuscular conditions. Doctors reportedly referred patients to him and were surprised by the results, but \\"none seemed to consider his drugless treatments as effective as surgery or medication\\" and the medical approach to these conditions did not fundamentally shift away from them as he had envisioned. Late in life, at the Esalen Institute, he was encouraged to begin teaching, which he did for the last 22 years of his life. At the beginning of a session, the practitioner enters into a state of meditation that Milton Trager originally termed \\"hook-up\\". From this state of mind, the practitioner uses gentle touch and a combination of passive and active movement with the intent of teaching the recipient how to move with less effort. The contact is gentle in a sense; it may be quite firm but is without strain or resistance. Regarding pain, Trager practitioners avoid causing pain, and attempt to contact the body in a way that allows the client to have decreased fear of pain and increased willingness to be present with the full range of sensations. Practitioners are taught to allow a tone of curiosity, playfulness, and effortlessness to guide their work.

WIR issues and manages a private currency, called the WIR Franc, which is used in combination with the Swiss Franc to generate dual-currency transactions.  System  The WIR Franc is an electronic currency reflected in clients' trade accounts and so there is no paper money. The intentions of starting were in increased sales, cash flow and profits for a qualified participant. WIR created a credit system which issues credit, in WIR Francs, to its members. The credit lines are secured by members pledging assets which ensures that the currency is asset-backed. When two members enter into a transaction with both Swiss Francs and WIR Francs it reduces the amount of cash needed by the buyer; the seller does not discount its product or service.  History  WIR was founded in 1934 by businessmen Werner Zimmermann and Paul Enz as a result of currency shortages and global financial instability. A banking license was granted in 1936. Both Zimmermann and Enz had been influenced by German libertarian socialist economist Silvio Gesell; however, the WIR Bank renounced Gesell's \\"free money\\" theory in 1952, opening the door to monetary interest. \\"WIR\\" is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring and the word for \\"we\\" in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community. According to the cooperative's statutes, \\"Its purpose is to encourage participating members to put their buying power at each other's disposal and keep it circulating within their ranks, thereby providing members with additional sales volume.\\" Although WIR started with only sixteen members, today it has grown to include 62,000. Total assets are approximately 3.0 billion CHF, annual sales in the range of 6.5 billion, as of 2005. As of 1998, assets held by the credit system were 885 million and liabilities of 844 million, i.e. the circulating WIR money, with equity in the system of 44 million. These WIR obligations being interest free have a cost of zero. Income from interest and credit clearing activities were 38 million francs. The currency code is CHW as designated by ISO 4217. The WIR Bank was a not-for-profit entity, although that status changed during the Bank's expansion. The bank considers themselves as stable, claiming being fully operational during times of general economic crisis and may dampen downturns in the business cycle, helping to stabilize the Swiss economy during difficult times.Stodder, James. , Proceedings of the IEEE Engineering Management Society Conference, Albuquerque, New Mexico, August 2000.

Breeding Yeats is a dark-coated bay horse with a small white star and white socks on his hind legs foaled on 23 April 2001 at Barronstown Stud. Yeats is by Sadler's Wells, out of Lyndonville (also owned by Barronstown Stud) by Top Ville. He is owned by Ballydoyle and Coolmore Stud boss John Magnier. He is named after the painter Jack Butler Yeats. Racing record=2003: two-year-old season Yeats began his racing career as a two-year- old with a win by four lengths in a maiden race, over eight furlongs, at the Curragh. 2004: three-year-old season Yeats was unbeaten in his next two starts, including the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial in May 2004, and was hot favourite for The Derby, but met with a setback just days before the race and missed the rest of the season, returning almost 1 year later, finishing 2nd in a Group 3 in Ireland on heavy ground. 2005: four-year-old season Yeats' next start came at Epsom in the Coronation Cup, taking on subsequent Japan Cup winner Alkaased, Bandari and dual Coronation Cup winner Warrsan. Jockey Kieren Fallon adopted front-running tactics on the colt, and pulled away in the final quarter-mile to win by more than 2 lengths. The win made Yeats the first Irish-based horse to win the Coronation Cup since Roberto in 1973. Yeats attempted to follow up in the Group 1 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud over the same distance, with new jockey Jimmy Fortune adopting hold-up tactics, but they failed to pay off, and Yeats trailed in 9th, 20 lengths behind the winner Alkaased. The Irish St. Leger came next, reunited with Kieren Fallon, adopting similar hold-up tactics as Fortune in Yeats' previous start, and was staying- on towards the finish to come 4th, just a length and a half behind the winner Collier Hill. His final start of the season was to be the Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Canada over 12 furlongs, but he missed the break and could never recover, finishing 12 lengths behind the victor. 2006: five-year-old season Yeats' first start of the 2006 season was at Royal Ascot in the Ascot Gold Cup, some 247 days after the Woodbine Canadian International Stakes. Fallon adopted a prominent position towards the start, and got to the front 4 furlongs out, and was only pulling away towards the end, winning by 4 lengths from Prix du Cadran winner Reefscape. He attempted a rare double with the Goodwood Cup at the Glorious Goodwood meeting, carrying top weight and easing to victory by 5 lengths under new jockey Michael Kinane, since Fallon was banned from riding in the UK. Yeats finished a disappointing 7th in the Melbourne Cup, with Kieren Fallon stating that his mount just lacked his usual finishing kick and was not suited by the stop-start pace of the race. He was forced to make a big move a mile out to get to the front, ensuring that he maintained his speed for the finishing straight. He was voted the 2006 Cartier Racing Award as Top Stayer. 2007: six-year-old season In 2007 Yeats won his second consecutive Ascot Gold Cup and followed that up by winning the Irish St. Leger on his third attempt, giving trainer Aidan O'Brien his first win in that race, and the 1-2 as stablemate Scorpion came a close second to Yeats. 2008: seven-year-old season On 19 June 2008 Yeats became only the second horse in history to win the Ascot Gold Cup three times in succession, defeating Geordieland by 5 lengths. He followed this on 31 July with a second victory in the Goodwood Cup, winning by 7 lengths. Later in the year, on 26 October he won the Prix Royal-Oak at Longchamp. 2009: eight-year-old season On 18 June 2009, Yeats made Ascot history, becoming the first horse ever to win the Ascot Gold Cup four times in succession, ridden by Johnny Murtagh, and winning by 3¬Ω lengths, making him arguably the best stayer of all time. Although many believe Ardross to be the best stayer of modern times. Stud record Yeats was retired to stud after his 2009 campaign. He has previously stood at Coolmore's headquarters farm in Ireland, but now stands at the company's National Hunt breeding farm, also in Ireland.

Casullo who has 35 years of coaching experience was most recently the Assistant Head Coach and Special Teams Coordinator for Syracuse University but left that position in November 2010, one week before the team's final regular season game. Bob and his Wife Pat have 2 sons, Rocco & Jamie. Early life Casullo attended Little Falls High School where he was a three-sport athlete for the Mounties. He was a captain for all three (football, basketball and baseball) teams. After starring at quarterback in high school, Casullo went on to a career as Fullback for the Brockport State University football team in New York, earning honorable mention All-America honors his senior season. Coaching career=Raiders Throughout his college and NFL career, Casullo has distinguished himself as one of the league's better special teams coaches. His special teams unit helped the Raiders to three consecutive AFC West titles (2000‚Äì2002) including an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII. In 2000, his unit led the whole of the NFL in net punting average. In 2001, they led the AFC sending their punter to the Pro Bowl. That year, he also produced an outstanding kickoff coverage unit (best in the NFL), that kept opponents less than 20 yards from their own end zone 17 times. In his final year with the Raiders he produced a unit that was third in the NFL in punt return average. Jets During his 2004 season with the New York Jets as tight ends coach, Curtis Martin won the NFL Rushing title (by 1 yard). Seahawks His first season with the Seahawks, in 2005, was rocky but not without success. The special teams were plagued by injuries and saw a rotation of injury replacements. Casullo had lost former Special Teams Pro Bowler Alex Bannister to another broken collar bone, and the other injuries to WRs, LBs and DB began to eat into his personnel. There were also miscues: several fumbles on kick and punt returns, some lost, notably at (certainly not in) the hands of Josh Scobey seemed to portend ill tidings. Blown coverages that allowed a kick return for a touchdown in St. Louis versus the hated Rams, and a punt return for a touchdown by Steve Smith in the NFC Championship game threatened to doom the Seahawks greatest season. But converted safety Jordan \\"Big Play Babs\\" Babineaux forced a fumble on special teams which was recovered by long snapper J. P. Darche to seal the victory in St. Louis. There was evidence of an illegal block in the back freeing Steve Smith for the punt returned for a TD, but the officials picked up the flag, surprising and elating the Carolina radio crew. Josh Brown, who provided his share of game-winning kicks, ultimately tied a franchise record of 8 50+ yard field goals and earned an invite as a Pro Bowl alternate. Buccaneers On January 19, 2007, Casullo was reunited with Coach John Gruden & hired as the tight ends coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, replacing the departing Ron Middleton. He joined the staff immediately and will be part of the coaching staff for the Senior Bowl. Syracuse On Friday, February 13, 2009, Syracuse University announced that Casullo had been hired as Syracuse University's assistant head coach for football. On November 22, 2010, Syracuse Head Coach Doug Marrone whom was coached by Casullo at Syracuse has announced that Casullo was no longer a part of the coaching staff. Marrone gave no further explanation but went on to success with a team that Casullo recruited & stocked up for him.

It forms part of the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is named after John Radcliffe, an 18th- century physician and Oxford University graduate, who endowed the Radcliffe Infirmary, the main hospital for Oxford from 1770 until 1979. It is the main teaching hospital for Oxford University and Oxford Brookes University, and incorporates the Oxford University Medical School. History The distinctive large white-tiled structure occupies a prominent position on Headington Hill, on the outskirts of Oxford. JR1: This was the initial hospital building, opened in 1972. It houses women's services and neonatology. The second building, JR2, opened in 1979 and is much larger. It contains most of the other specialist services for the region. Other facilities were then added to the site, including the University of Oxford's Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the Brain. Model Utahraptor at the entrance of John Radcliffe Children's Hospital The West Wing: With the closure of the Radcliffe Infirmary and consolidation of the other hospital sites in Oxford, a further large expansion took place, the facilities for which were procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2003. The works, which were designed by Austin-Smith:Lord and undertaken by Carillion at a cost of ¬£134 million, were completed in December 2006. This new complex, known as the West Wing, involved the construction of the new Oxford Children's Hospital, the relocated Oxford Eye Hospital, and the departments of neurosciences/head and neck and of Ear Nose & Throat (ENT). The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh officially commemorated the opening of the new West Wing and Children's Hospital at a special ceremony in late November 2008 in front of patients, staff, fundraisers and supporters who had helped raise the ¬£15 million needed to build the Children's Hospital.The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh visit Oxfordshire.

It is in the civil parish of Braunton. Knowle is situated near to the Iron Age fortification of Knowle Hill Castle. The number of people in Knowle expanded considerably in the 1960s with the building of a large number of bungalows which almost doubled the housing stock. As it was many who took up those early purchase were more likely to speak 'Brum' than westcountry...at the time there was a push for people from the Midlands to relocate to ease the housing issues under a policy known as 'over-spill' . The estate of about 50 bungalows were built by the local builder 'Jimmy' James Dennis whose had all his own trades and workers and even ran his own sawmills and forestry to create the necessary wood. One old timer in the 90's, remembered cutting down the trees as a lad, having replanted the ground and then having cut down the trees that had grown in the intervening 50 years ...and replanting again. Jimmy lived on the small hill above the new houses towards the C of E but never had a problem with water for his garden or greenhouse...he had built a 'cistern' on the hill opposite, fed by a simple pipe laid into a stream that emerged from the top of that hill and laid a pipe right across the village to his house. Knowle had two churches; C of E at the top of the hill (now closed) and a Methodist hall in the middle of the village. In the 1960s there was a small shop by the main road, separate post office, garage and a pub, the 'Ebrington Arms' but currently apart from the pub, the rest have been merged into the garage. In the 70's the pub was little changed from the way it had been built with a single room from each side of a central front door and a bar that extended into each room. In the 1980s the pub was extensively modified to cater for food services. Jimmy Dennis's old yard continues as a yard for several businesses but the trees are now safe. About 0.5 miles from the village, at Winsham, there were three farms who maintained the fields with arable and dairy stocks. One of the farms used to provide a daily milk delivery service with both pasteurised and raw deliveries straight from the farm...probably from cow to cornflakes in about 2 hours !, [glass] bottled and delivered by the farmers wife, (Mrs Glanville and her mini van!) ...the blue tits loved the cream off the milk bottles. A small holding just outside of the village was run by Mr and Mrs Petherick who supplied all the eggs you could want and the occasional chicken (a rare thing for a special Sunday lunch in the 60's) but she could also provide a [bred] rabbit as a pet... or for eating. The village shop was run for years in the 60's and 70's by Mr and Mrs Perryman and as people didn't have supermarkets or many cars, the small shop, the local farmer, the small holder and peoples own gardens, provided most of what people needed and for other items it was a bus ride to Braunton or all the way to Barnstaple...especially popular on Fridays, cattle market day and the Pannier Market. To complete the team, Mrs Fry ran the post office (and Sunday school) at the time and the Padisons ran the pub. Also in the village at the time were Mrs Kirchoff who taught piano, Mr Shepherd who was a great painter and A.H. Slee a published historian who had written several books including one about Braunton. Mr Bray was the tech teacher who worked in a Barnstaple school but was known to shut himself in his garage to create working steam engines; Harry Rooke was Jummy Dennis's foreman and who got the houses built; Mr Gubb ran his 5 tonne lorry including the bricks, sand and cement for all the local building....a community, largely self-sufficient The village came together throughout the year for different things but often as a result of the local Women's Institute, but especially to create the lorry floats for the children to enter the Braunton Carnival Parade...thousands of paper flowers must have been made in evenings over the years to decorate those floats. The village layout has changed little since the 60's except for a small number of in- fills, replacements and renovations.

History In 1925, the original proposed number for a U.S. Highway to run from Oshkosh to Fremont, Wisconsin, was U.S. Route 112. However, the number approved for the route in 1926 was U.S. Route 110 (US 110). This route, which would be the forerunner of Wisconsin Highway 110, started out as a long south-to-north U.S. highway located entirely within Wisconsin. The southern terminus of the route was at US 41 (now the intersection of US 45 and Highway 76) in Oshkosh. The northern terminus was at US 10 (now the northern terminus of the Highway 96/Highway 110 concurrency) east of Fremont, Wisconsin. US 110 was deleted in 1939 and subsequently replaced with WIS 110\\\\. Due to a series of extensions and truncations in the 70 years since, however, WIS 110 is no longer designated on most of the former routing of US 110\\\\.

One of his most important decisions was to establish a full-time guerrilla unit of flying column, under Tom Barry. The Third Cork Brigade went on to be one of the most active IRA units during the guerrilla war against the British in 1919‚Äì1921. According to Barry, Hurley led an ambush of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Ahawadda, in April 1920 killing three policemen, wounding one and taking their arms and ammunition. In July of that year, Hurley led a successful attack on Coastguard station at Howes Strand, capturing a large amount of weapons and ammunition. Barry remarked that Hurley was 'a remarkable man and a lovable personality' and 'continually urged a fighting army policy'. Hurley was present at the Tooreen ambush in October 1920 and subsequently was part of an assassination attempt on a judge who gave 'harsh sentences' to IRA members. From December 1920 until January 1921, Hurley took command of the Third Cork Brigade's flying column while Barry was ill. He also toured IRA units to assess the impact of the Catholic Bishop of Cork, Dr. Colohan's decree of excommunication on the guerrilla movement. Death and memory In February 1921, he led the disastrous Upton Train Ambush on 15 February 1921, an attack on train carrying British troops. In the action, the attacking IRA party was heavily outnumbered and the fire fight resulted in three IRA men and six civilians being killed. Hurley was also badly wounded in the face and ankle. Tom Barry wrote of the aftermath of the ambush 'he [Hurley] mourned deeply for his dead comrades and for the dead civilians, whom he did not know'. Hurley was killed in action by British troops just before the Crossbarry Ambush on 19 March 1921. Hurley was staying in a house with a pro-republican family, where he was recuperating from serious wounds he had received at Upton a month earlier. When he realised that he was surrounded by the British forces he fled the house, as Tom Barry comments in his book, to reduce the danger to those in the house, and was shot dead by pursuing troops. Barry remarks that Hurley, 'died in the manner in which we expected.' The British Army placed his body at the workhouse in Bandon but members of Cumann na mBan surreptitiously took away his body and he was given a secret republican funeral in Clogagh.(5) A local ballad exists that commemorates him. In addition, the Gaelic Athletic Association grounds in Bandon was named after him in 1971.

It is the second game in the Game & Watch Gallery series, after Game Boy Gallery. It is known as in Japan, and as Game Boy Gallery 2 in Australia. This game is the only game in the Game & Watch Gallery series to have its own soundtrack. The soundtrack also included updated versions of the music featured in the game. A sequel, called Game & Watch Gallery 2, was released in 1997 for the Game Boy Color. Gameplay Game & Watch Gallery features the following four games: * Manhole: Mario, Toad and Donkey Kong Jr. are continuously walking across a platform. Players control Yoshi and must maneuver him in order to hold a manhole up to various gaps in the platform so that the characters do not fall. * Oil Panic: Mario must catch leaking oil with a bucket, then dump it out the window to Yoshi before it overflows. * Octopus: Mario dives for treasure to give to Peach but must avoid an octopus' moving tentacles. The background beat of the music that plays during the modern version of Octopus is from the Popeye arcade game. It was later included in Game & Watch Gallery 4. * Fire: Peach's castle is burning and Toad, Yoshi and Donkey Kong Jr. are continuously leaping out to escape. Players control Mario and Luigi, who hold a tarp and must bounce their friends to safety. Like Octopus, Fire was later included in Game & Watch Gallery 4. Players can also choose to play these games in their original form, playing as the character who eventually became known as Mr. Game & Watch in Super Smash Bros. Melee. There are some slight differences between the classic and modern versions and in the former the games are composed of simple pixel graphics rather than detailed sprites. When played on a Super Game Boy or Game Boy Color, it receives a limited color upgrade. Development Game & Watch Gallery was designed by TOSE and Nintendo R&D1; and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Game Boy in Japan on February 1, 1997, in the United States on May 5, 1997, in Europe on August 28, 1997, and in Australia in 1997; it was released for the Nintendo Power for the Game Boy in Japan on March 1, 2000. It was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in Japan on June 22, 2011, in North America on July 14, 2011, and in Europe and Australia on July 21, 2011; while it was originally released under the title Game Boy Gallery 2 in Australia, the Virtual Console release uses the title Game & Watch Gallery. Reception Game & Watch Gallery holds an average of 76.65% on Game Rankings, based on four reviews. Steve Averett for IGN held it in high regard, comparing it to Tetris and Dr. Mario in terms of being a quality \\"twitch\\" game. They note it as a good game for fan of Game & Watch games, while it was recognized as IGNs readers' choice for the \\"best Game Boy action game\\" of the century. Nathan Meunier of GamesRadar+ found the game addictive while praising it for the updated Game & Watch games. However, they found the original versions less fun, and wished more games were featured on the cartridge. Jeremy Parish for USgamer identified it as one of the best Game Boy games on the Nintendo 3DS' Virtual Console, while Thomas East of Official Nintendo Magazine UK felt it was among the best retro games on the 3DS' Virtual Console. East found the games basic, but addictive nonetheless. Clark Anderson of Digitally Downloaded found the Virtual Console re-release a good value, praising the different games (particularly Fire) as addictive. Andrew Brown of Nintendo World Report felt that the game offered something for all types of players, due to the combination of the classic games and the remade games. However, Kristan Reed of Eurogamer felt that those who lack nostalgia for this game or Game & Watch games in general would not enjoy this much, calling it \\"little more than a curiosity.\\" Tyler Treese of Game Revolution expressed hope that Game & Watch Gallery, along with its sequels, was remade for the Nintendo Switch. Author James Newman discussed how it served as a precursor to the trend of remastering games that grew popular on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, citing how the game enhances the visuals of the remastered versions while keeping the gameplay the same.

It consists of 25 scenes and is written predominantly in blank verse. Modest Mussorgsky's opera, Boris Godunov (1874), is based on this play. History=Composition Having finished the play, Pushkin famously wrote to his friend Pyotr Vyazemsky: \\"What a Pushkin, what a son of a bitch!\\" . Pushkin wrote of the play: > The study of Shakespeare, Karamzin, and our old chronicles gave me the idea > of clothing in dramatic forms one of the most dramatic epochs of our > history. Not disturbed by any other influence, I imitated Shakespeare in his > broad and free depictions of characters, in the simple and careless > combination of plots; I followed Karamzin in the clear development of > events; I tried to guess the way of thinking and the language of the time > from the chronicles.

Meyerhold commissioned Sergei Prokofiev to write incidental music for his production, but when Meyerhold abandoned it under political pressure, the score was abandoned as well . The original, uncensored play did not receive a premi√®re until April 12, 2007, at Princeton University in the United States, and then only in an English translation. This production was based on Meyerhold's design and featured Prokofiev's music, together with supplemental music by Peter Westergaard.

Key events are as follows: *1584 ‚Äì Ivan IV \\"The Terrible\\", the first Grand Prince of Muscovy to use the title Tsar (Caesar), dies. Ivan's successor is his retiring and politically feeble son Fyodor, now Fyodor I, who cares mostly for spiritual matters, and leaves the affairs of state to his capable brother-in-law, boyar Boris Godunov, now de facto regent. *1591 ‚Äì Ivan's other son Dmitriy dies under mysterious circumstances in Uglich. An investigation, ordered by Godunov and carried out by Prince Vasiliy Shuyskiy, determines that the Tsarevich, while playing with a knife, had an epileptic seizure, fell, and died from a self-inflicted wound to the throat. Dmitriy's mother, Maria Nagaya, exiled with him to Uglich by Godunov, claims he was assassinated. Rumors linking Boris to the crime are circulated by his enemies. *1598 ‚Äì Tsar Fyodor I dies. He is virtually the last representative of the Ryurik Dynasty that has ruled Russia for seven centuries. Patriarch Job of Moscow nominates Boris to succeed Fyodor I as Tsar, despite the rumors that Boris ordered the murder of Dmitriy. Boris agrees to ascend the throne only if elected by the Zemskiy Sobor. This the assembly does unanimously, and Boris is crowned the same year. *1604 ‚Äì A pretender to the throne appears, claiming to be Tsarevich Dmitriy, but believed to be in reality one Grigoriy Otrepyev. He gains the support of the Polish aristocracy, and, obtaining a force of soldiers, he marches on Moscow. Crossing into Russia, Dmitriy's invasion force is joined by disaffected Cossacks. However, after a few victories, it loses momentum. *1605 ‚Äì Boris dies of unknown causes. He is succeeded by his son Fyodor, now Fyodor II. The death of Boris gives new life to the campaign of the False Dmitriy, who enters Moscow. Boyars who flock to his side murder Fyodor II and his mother. *1606 ‚Äì False Dmitriy I is murdered, and is succeeded by Vasiliy Shuyskiy, now Vasiliy IV. *1610 ‚Äì Vasiliy IV is deposed, and dies two years later in a Polish prison. Another pretender claiming to be Dmitriy Ivanovich, False Dmitriy II, is murdered. *1612 ‚Äì Yet a third pretender, False Dmitriy III, is captured and executed. *1613 ‚Äì The Time of Troubles comes to a close with the accession of Mikhail Romanov, son of Fyodor Romanov, who had been persecuted under Boris Godunov's reign. The culpability of Boris in the matter of Dmitriy's death can neither be proven nor disproved. Karamzin, the historian to whom the drama is dedicated, accepted it as fact and Pushkin himself assumed it was true, at least for the purpose of creating a tragedy in the mold of Shakespeare. Modern historians, however, tend to acquit Boris of the crime.

The school serves grades 9 through 12 and is the second largest school in the Pasadena Independent School District. It is sometimes referred simply as \\"Memorial\\" or as \\"PMHS\\" to differentiate it from nearby Pasadena High School. The current principal is Jeremy Richardson. Facilities The school, constructed on an site, is designed around three main segments. The first segment includes the academic area, library and central administration area. The second segment contains the music and drama departments, auditorium, gymnasium and drill team. The third segment contains the dining hall and vocational laboratories. Two landscaped courtyards that surround the dining hall are used for outdoor dining, a sculpture court, and an art lab. Beyond its functional aspects, the courtyards provide a quiet environment for students and staff. Expansion Since the opening of the school, district officials contemplated expanding the school. A week before the end of the first semester in 2006, the school opened a new wing adjacent to the mathematics hall that houses English teachers. The original plan for this wing was for it to be the Freshman Academy, where all freshmen would attend class. However the plan was not used. PMHS also built a new field house exclusively for its football program right off the south parking lot.pasadena memorial high school expansion Recently, outdoor portable buildings, converted to classrooms, have been provided for overflow as the number of students has exceeded the school's capacity. Students are allotted one additional minute to reach these facilities, which was decreased from the original travel time of two minutes. A student petition was created that had more than five hundred signatures against the time decrease, but the administration denied the students appeal for an additional minute to travel to portable classes claiming that students should \\"walk faster\\" as quoted by Assistant Principal Kevin Blain. Plus an addition of security cameras were added in the hallways, cafeteria, and outside of building, along with police officers to ensure more safety due to a survey taken by parents and students whom requested more security. A 2014 bond was introduced to expand the campus by adding an Early College High School (ECHS) wing to PMHS. It was proposed to help with the overcrowdedness since the school was originally only made to hold 2,000 students. The ECHS was officially opened at the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year. Neighborhoods served The school serves portions of the city of Pasadena including Strawberry Glen and small sections of Houston around Ellington Field, including Genoa Township, Southway Gardens, and Gulf Palms.

It also carries the games of several Southern California sports teams: San Diego Padres baseball, Los Angeles Chargers football and Los Angeles Lakers basketball. CBS Radio News is heard at the beginning of most hours. KXO is powered at 830 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night, a Class C station. So its signal is limited to the Imperial Valley. The transmitter is off West Villa Avenue.Radio-Locator.com/KXO-AM History KXO is the oldest station in the Imperial Valley and is probably the oldest in any community between San Diego and Phoenix. It first signed on in 1927.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 22 In the 1930s, it broadcast at 100 watts on 1500 kilocycles. It was owned by E.R. Irey and F.M. Bowles. Its studios were at 793 Main Street. After the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) took effect in 1941, KXO moved to 1490 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 74 It was owned by Valradio, Inc. and was a network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System and the Don Lee Network, during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" Over the years, it spent time as an affiliate of ABC and NBC Radio. In the 1950s, KXO moved to its current dial position at AM 1230.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-116 KXO dates back to the early days of broadcasting, when many radio stations were assigned three-letter call signs. In Southern California, the only three-letter stations that remain, apart from KXO, are 640 KFI, 930 KHJ and 1070 KNX in Los Angeles. KGB-FM in San Diego is the FM sister station to the original KGB, now KLSD 1360 AM. Over the years, KXO has featured several different formats. Currently, the station broadcasts oldies music with a playlist from the 1960s and 1970s, along with some 1980s titles. In 1963, the governments of the U.S. and Mexico agreed to give El Centro two TV stations, Channel 7 and Channel 9, whose signals would include parts of Mexico. KXO, Inc. received permission from the Federal Communications Commission to build a TV station, Channel 7 KXO-TV. But a TV station in Yuma, Arizona, KIVA Channel 11, worked to block the competing stations, saying there was not enough economic activity in the region to support three commercial TV stations. Channel 9 KECY-TV eventually made it on the air in December 1968, but KXO-TV never did. Channel 7 finally came on the air in 1996, under the ownership of Entravision Communications. It is now KVYE. KXO has had news and weather sharing partnerships with television stations KECY and KSWT. Some on- air personalities and newscasters have also been heard on KXO and the TV stations.

When completed in 1910, it was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world.  History  The inspection crawlway inside the Paulinskill Viaduct, which travels over the individual arches of the bridge. The viaduct was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad as part of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, a project that replaced an older route with a straighter and flatter route through the mountains of northwestern New Jersey. (A sister bridge of similar design but smaller dimension, the Delaware River Viaduct, carries the Lackawanna Cut-Off over the river, Interstate 80, and the New Jersey-Pennsylvania state line.) Designed by the DL&W;'s engineering staff under the supervision of chief engineer Lincoln Bush and built by the Philadelphia contracting firm of Reiter, Curtis & Hill, the bridge was considered a pioneering work that opened the door to the building of even larger concrete viaducts by the Lackawanna, most notably the Tunkhannock Viaduct in Pennsylvania in 1915. Opened to regular rail traffic on Christmas Eve 1911, the Paulinskill Viaduct, supported by its seven graceful arches, carried DL&W; trains until 1960, when the railroad merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. The E-L in turn operated the Cut-Off until 1976 when the railroad was conveyed into Conrail, which ran trains until 1979, abandoned the line in 1982, and removed the tracks in 1984. New Jersey Transit is working to restore commuter service along the Cut-Off, with the section from Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey, to Andover, New Jersey, currently under construction and slated to open in 2020. NJT has proposed to restore the rest of the Cut-Off, including the Paulinskill Viaduct, and restore passenger service into northeastern Pennsylvania, possibly as far as Scranton. The Paulinskill Viaduct is also known for its internal chambers (used to inspect the structural integrity of the bridge), which are popular among those who enjoy urban exploration. The graffiti-filled chambers have been featured on Weird NJ.

Originally a single tunnel that opened to traffic in 1957, it was called the Lehigh Tunnel to avoid confusion with the existing Kittatinny Mountain Tunnel on the mainline. The tunnel was twinned in 1991 to allow two lanes of traffic in each direction. It has an unusual appearance, as the original (northbound) tunnel is rectangular, as it used the older dig-and-blast technique, while the new tube is oval, having been constructed using the New Austrian Tunnelling method. From 1980 to 1996, the Northeast Extension was designated as Pennsylvania Route 9, as opposing traffic faced each other in the single tube prior to the opening of the current southbound tube, and therefore did not qualify for Interstate highway status, which was granted five years after the completion of the southbound tube.PA Highways.com page about the history of PA 9 Retrieved January 23, 2011 The Lehigh Tunnel crosses the border between Lehigh County and Carbon County. It is the only road tunnel crossed by the Appalachian Trail. Howard M. Sexton, a 70-year-old truck driver from New Jersey, was killed in the southbound Lehigh Tunnel on February 21, 2018, when an electrical conduit broke free from the tunnel's ceiling and fell through the windshield of his truck, striking him in the head. In a preliminary report issued on May 1, 2018, the National Transportation Safety Board revealed that a 10-foot-long section of conduit fell into the path of Sexton's truck after the steel support system for the conduits, which were suspended from the apex of the tunnel arch directly over the travel lanes, failed.

The technique can identify one or more RNA molecules of known sequence even at low total concentration. The extracted RNA is first mixed with antisense RNA or DNA probes that are complementary to the sequence or sequences of interest and the complementary strands are hybridized to form double-stranded RNA (or a DNA-RNA hybrid). The mixture is then exposed to ribonucleases that specifically cleave only single-stranded RNA but have no activity against double-stranded RNA. When the reaction runs to completion, susceptible RNA regions are degraded to very short oligomers or to individual nucleotides; the surviving RNA fragments are those that were complementary to the added antisense strand and thus contained the sequence of interest.  Probe  The probes are prepared by cloning part of the gene of interest in a vector under the control of any of the following promoters, SP6, T7 or T3. These promoters are recognized by DNA dependent RNA polymerases originally characterized from bacteriophages. The probes produced are radioactive as they are prepared by in vitro transcription using radioactive UTPs. Uncomplemented DNA or RNA is cleaved off by nucleases. When the probe is a DNA molecule, S1 nuclease is used; when the probe is RNA, any single-strand-specific ribonuclease can be used. Thus the surviving probe-mRNA complement is simply detected by autoradiography.  Uses  Nuclease protection assays are used to map introns and 5' and 3' ends of transcribed gene regions. Quantitative results can be obtained regarding the amount of the target RNA present in the original cellular extract - if the target is a messenger RNA, this can indicate the level of transcription of the gene in the cell. They are also used to detect the presence of double stranded RNA, presence of which could mean RNA interference. Northern blotting is a laboratory technique that produces similar information. It is slower and less quantitative, but also produces accurate information about the size of the target RNA. Nuclease protection assay products are limited to the size of the initial probes due to the destruction of the non-hybridized RNA during the nuclease digestion step. References *Sandelin, A. et al.

Lacamara has mostly played supporting characters and guest star roles, with the exception of his roles as Paco Ort√≠z on the sitcom Nurses, and as Ray Garc√≠a, the family patriarch on The Brothers Garc√≠a. Carlos also starred as \\"Horace Diaz\\" in the series Mighty Med. Early life Lac√°mara was born in Havana, Cuba but moved to Washington D.C. in 1960,Carlos Lacamara Biography (1958-) because of the Cuban Revolution. After that, he moved to Puerto Rico, and then to California, where he resides now. He attended UCLA. Career In the early 1990s, he played orderly Paco Ortiz on the NBC sitcom Nurses. He also made recurring guest appearances on the crime series Silk Stalkings and Close to Home. The latter series, in which Lac√°mara plays a medical examiner, is rare in casting the actor in the role of a highly educated professional, although his recent guest roles have shifted from the early trend to cast him as a waiter, valet, or other entry level worker. In 1995, he played the assassin Retaya in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Improbable Cause\\". In 1997, Lac√°mara also played one of the starring roles in the educational series Connect With English, a fictional drama written for students of English as a Second Language. In 1998, he appeared in an episode of the NBC sitcom Friends in The One with Joey's Dirty Day. Although characters from Nurses occasionally appeared on Empty Nest, from which their show had originated, Lac√°mara's only appearance on Empty Nest was in an unrelated role in 1995, after Nurses had ended its run. Lac√°mara's role in The Brothers Garc√≠a reunited him with former Nurses co-star Ada Maris. In 2009, he made an appearance on Fox's TV series Lie to Me as inspector Mike Adams. He played series regular Horace Diaz in Mighty Med from 2013‚Äì2015. In 2016, he played Martin Borja on Major Crimes.

Broader definitions include providing shade or support to other plants. Some of the advantages a nurse log offers to a seedling are: water, moss thickness, leaf litter, mycorrhizae, disease protection, nutrients, and sunlight. Recent research into soil pathogens suggests that in some forest communities, pathogens hostile to a particular tree species appear to gather in the vicinity of that species, and to a degree inhibit seedling growth. Nurse logs may therefore provide some measure of protection from these pathogens, thus promoting greater seedling survivorship. Occurrence Nurse log harboring a young western hemlock Various mechanical and biological processes contribute to the breakdown of lignin in fallen trees, resulting in the formation of niches of increasing size, which tend to fill with forest litter such as soil from spring floods, needles, moss, mushrooms and other flora. Mosses also can cover the outside of a log, hastening its decay and supporting other species as rooting media and by retaining water. Small animals such as various squirrels often perch or roost on nurse logs, adding to the litter by food debris and scat. The decay of this detritus contributes to the formation of a rich humus that provides a seedbed and adequate conditions for germination. Nurse logs often provide a seedbed to conifers in a temperate rain forest ecosystem. ReferencesBooks * Montagnini, Florencia, and Benedict, Carl F. Jordan (2005).

He studied at Harvard Law School in 1850 and 1851, was admitted to the Ohio bar, and settled in Dayton. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1853 and 1854, and then moved to Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1855, Parrott was appointed reporter of decisions for the first session of the Kansas Territory's Supreme Court.

It was first published in 1987 in , a manga supplement of the gay magazine . The short story is a famous meme on the Internet (especially on Japanese Internet forums). It is largely considered the representative work of Yamakawa and responsible for the revived popularity of his manga. Etymology Some translate the title as meaning \\"Poop Soup Technique\\". \\"Kuso\\" („Åè„Åù) means \\"crap\\", though the word is often used simply as interjection. Miso is actually a kind of seasoning used in miso soup. Kuso Miso figuratively meaning \\"mess, muddle\\", a state where one cannot tell the difference between brown miso paste and feces. Plot Masaki Michishita, a \\"typical guy\\" enrolled in preparatory school, is running to the park washroom when he spots a man wearing a jumpsuit sitting on a nearby bench. The man, Takakazu Abe, unzips his jumpsuit and exposes his penis, asking Masaki, . They proceed to the washroom to have sexual intercourse. When Abe performs fellatio on Michishita, the latter cannot hold his bladder and accidentally urinates in Abe's mouth. Abe suggests that Michishita empty his bladder in Abe during anal sex, and Michishita does so. When it is Michishita's turn to be on the receiving end, he defecates on Abe's penis, much to the dismay of Abe and the embarrassment of a middle-aged man walking by, who overheard their conversation: \\"But you never know, it might be fun to do it covered in shit.\\" Characters ; : A prep school student with no prior sexual experience with men, though he often fantasizes about them. He is strongly attracted to Takakazu Abe at first sight, prompting him to think, . ; : An auto mechanic. In the story, he sits provocatively on a park bench looking for sex. He is well-endowed and an experienced sexual partner. Impact Takakazu Abe (left) and Masaki Michishita (right). Their faces in this panel are prominently featured in parodies. Interest in this manga outside of homoerotica circles sparked more than ten years after its first publication, as it was illegally posted on Ayashii World in 2002. There, the manga gained some interest for its surreal depiction of gay men and its cheesy storyline. In March 2003, pages of the manga were posted on Futaba Channel, triggering the so-called \\"Yamajun boom\\" of interest in Junichi Yamakawa's works. At the same time, Shift_JIS art of the manga produced on 2channel also contributed to the boom. Since then, lines from the manga such as \\"uho! ii otoko\\" and \\"yaranai ka\\" became known as the \\"Yamajun language\\", which became popular Internet slang. On Japanese forums and imageboards, as well as in homosexual circles, the interjection \\"uho!\\", along with other lines from his manga, is often taken in a homoerotic context for the above reason. \\"Yaranaika\\" itself was ranked the 16th in 2007's \\"Net Slang of the Year\\" in Japan. Parody art of the manga, usually achieved by photoshopping the characters' orgasmic expressions onto other images, are often seen at various imageboards. Similarly, Takakazu Abe makes several (unnamed) comic-relief cameos in the hentai manga Alignment You! You!, saying his famous line in most of them. The manga was also referenced in the 2012 anime series Joshiraku. A theme song (\\"Yaranaika\\") has also been attributed to Takakazu Abe, using homoerotic lyrics to the melody of \\"Balalaika\\", a song by Morning Musume member Koharu Kusumi. Yuichiro Nagashima, the cosplay kickboxer, once entered the ring in Abe's eponymous jumpsuit with the parody song as background music. The song remains popular on video sites such as Nico Nico Douga, where it has been integrated into one of the site's most popular medleys. In 2009, in a survey asking its respondents \\"which manga do you think is the most interesting?\\" in a pool of 6000, Kuso Miso Technique came at 11th, beating popular manga such as Gin Tama and Case Closed. Japanese pornography maker Moodyz released a live-action adaptation in 2012, describing it as a collaboration work with Junichi Yamakawa and a \\"pinnacle of anal\\". Female porn stars were cast as the characters Takakazu Abe () and Masaki Michishita (), despite the characters referring to themselves as male in the adult video. In 2014, American manga publishing firm Digital Manga Publishing created an April Fools' joke where they claimed that their pornographic label Project-H would release Kuso Miso Technique in English.

The Buhl Building in Downtown Detroit is the headquarters of SMART The Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) is the public transit operator serving suburban Metro Detroit. It partners with the Detroit Department of Transportation. Beginning operations in 1967 as the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA), it operates 44 linehaul and three park-and-ride bus routes in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties. Its name was changed to SMART in 1989. As of 2008, SMART has the third highest ridership of Michigan's transit systems, surpassed by Capital Area Transportation Authority and Detroit Department of Transportation. SMART has its headquarters in the Buhl Building in Downtown Detroit.\\"Contact SMART.\\" Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation. Retrieved on November 11, 2009. Some of SMART's routes enter the City of Detroit and serve the Downtown and Midtown cores during \\"peak hours\\" (Weekdays, 6-9A.M. and 3-6P.M.). Elsewhere in Detroit city limits, a local ordinance bars passengers from being dropped off on outbound routes, or boarding on inbound routes. This is intended to avoid service duplication with Detroit Department of Transportation, which supplements the city of Detroit with its own bus service. History The Michigan Legislature passed the Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act of 1967, which included the creation of Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA). SEMTA was charged to take over the ownership and operations of the fractured regional transit systems in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties, including the city of Detroit. The new authority acquired several suburban transit bus operations including Lake Shore Coach Lines (1971), Pontiac Municipal Transit Service (1973), Dearborn's Metropolitan Transit (1974), Birmingham's Great Lakes Transit (1974), and Royak Oak's Martin Lines (1975). However, the 1967 transportation act did not provide the regional authority with any means to levy taxes. By 1974, the Detroit Department of Street Railways (DSR) had been reorganized as a city department of Detroit, leaving SEMTA only coordination over the suburban services. That same year, SEMTA acquired a commuter train service between downtown Detroit and Pontiac from the Grand Trunk Western Railroad. Due to declining ridership and a lack of funding, the commuter rail service was discontinued in October 1983. In 1979, SEMTA approved a regional transit plan, which included improved bus service and new rail transit, but the plan was never implemented due to lack of funds. The last commuter rail service was a former Penn Central route, named the Michigan Executive, that ran from the Michigan Central Depot in Detroit to Jackson. Its final operator was by Amtrak, as funded by the State of Michigan. The already pared down Executive service ended in 1984. Beginning in 1983, SEMTA oversaw the construction of the Detroit People Mover, which was conceived as part of a much larger which consisted of light rail lines and a downtown subway. Mismanagement of the project resulted in tens-of-millions of dollars of cost overruns, causing the federal government to pull out of the project. In 1985, with the half-built project in limbo, the city of Detroit negotiated with SEMTA to take over the project, and it was transferred to the newly created Detroit Transportation Corporation. From SEMTA to SMART With little interest in the suburbs for expanding mass transit and Detroit not interested in joining the system, SEMTA was restructured as SMART in 1989, reducing the authority's service area from seven counties to three and excluding the city of Detroit. In October 2011, the authority cut 22% of its service and laid off 123 employees due to declining property values which fund the system through its millage, and the inability of the authority to reach an agreement with its unions. In January 2018, SMART began operation of its first major service expansion since the 2011 cuts to the system, adding three high frequency, limited-stop bus services branded FAST (Frequent Affordable Safe Transit) along Michigan, Woodward, and Gratiot avenues connecting downtown and Midtown to the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Wayne County, Pontiac in Oakland County, and Chesterfield Township in Macomb County, respectively. Fares NOTE: all fares are free since mid-March 2020 up to further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The adult cash fare for fixed routes is US$2 or $0.5 for all others, which includes 4-hour pass, if needed. The fare for \\"park-and- ride\\" express routes is $2.5, and $1 for children 6-17, seniors, disabled/Medicare. SMART also offers 31-day passes for each of the above fare categories, and a regional monthly pass, permitting unlimited rides on both SMART and DDOT for $49.50. Kids below tall pay no fare with fare-paying rider; limit 3. When transferring to higher-cost service, the difference must be paid. A 24-Hour pass is $5 or $2 for all others; this includes the QLine & the Detroit People Mover. On December 1, 2009, SMART raised its fares by $0.50. There was also a $0.50 charge added to regional monthly pass users and DDOT transfers. Fare increases were made to prevent possible cuts in bus services.http://www.smartbus.org/Smart/News+and+Info/Public+Notices/Fare+Increase+and+Transfer+Policy+Change+Effective+December+1+2009.htm Routes *125 Fort Street-Eureka Road *140 Southshore *160 Downriver *200 Michigan Avenue Local *250 Ford Road *255 Ford Road Express *261 FAST Michigan *275 Telegraph *280 Middlebelt South *330 Grand River / Beech Daly *400 Southfield / Orchard Ridge *405 Northwestern Highway *415 Greenfield *420 Southfield *430 Main Street / Big Beaver *445 Woodward & Maple Limited *450 Woodward Local -

His albums recorded for Blue Note Records in the 1970s have gained a cult following after the emergence of acid-jazz. Early life Foster was born in Buffalo, New York, on May 12, 1950. He attended Public School 8, Woodlawn Jr. High for a year, McKinley Vocational High School for two years, and then spent his final year at Lafayette High School. The only formal musical instruction he received was a month of accordion lessons. He was attracted to music at the age of four, took it more seriously from his early teens, and had his first professional gig aged fifteen, playing in a strip club. Later life and career Foster initially performed with other local musicians. He moved to New York City with his own band, and acquired a publishing company. Foster has performed as a sideman with a wide range of musicians. He frequently worked with guitarist George Benson, including playing on the guitarist's album Breezin'. Foster has also played organ with Grant Green, Grover Washington, Jr., Stanley Turrentine, Roberta Flack, Earl Klugh, Harvey Mason, Jimmy Smith, and Stevie Wonder. He is also a record producer. Ronnie Foster's song \\"Mystic Brew\\", was sampled in Electric Relaxation by A Tribe Called Quest as well as later in J. Cole's song Forbidden Fruit.

He was also the father of Union Civil War Generals Alfred Pleasonton and Augustus Pleasonton. Early career Little information has survived regarding Pleasonton's early life and career. He is known to have begun work as a clerk with the State Department. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 along with the government, and he was still there in 1814 when he saved the Declaration of Independence and other papers from being burned by British forces. In 1817, President James Monroe named Pleasonton to the new position of 'Fifth Auditor' in the Treasury Department, which he would hold until his death in 1855. As Fifth Auditor, he was responsible for all domestic accounts pertaining to the Department of State and the Patent Office, all bankers, consular and diplomatic accounts in foreign countries, as well as census accounts, claims adjustments for foreign governments, and boundary commissioner accounts. Saving the Declaration of Independence With the War of 1812 going poorly and worried that the British would attack Washington, Secretary of State James Monroe tasked Pleasonton with preserving the books and papers of the State Department. Pleasonton acquired several coarse linen bags, and filled them with all the Department's records. This included the still-unpublished secret journals of Congress, the commission and correspondence of George Washington, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution, and all the treaties, laws, and correspondence of the Department made since 1789. He had all of this placed in coarse linen sacks and carted to a grist mill two miles beyond Georgetown.Phillips, Heather A., Safety and Happiness; The Paradox of the Declaration of Independence. The Early America Review, Vol. VII No. 4. http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2007_summer_fall/preserving-documents.html Before he left, he noticed the Declaration of Independence had been forgotten and was still hanging in its frame on the wall, and took that as well. After one more day, Pleasonton became fearful that the British would destroy a nearby cannon foundry and possibly even the grist mill if they were to come to Washington, and procured wagons to take the material another thirty-five miles to Leesburg, Virginia, where they were stored in an empty stone house. That night, the British arrived and burned many buildings in the city. While the British left within two days, it was some weeks before the documents were returned to Washington. Lighthouse Establishment In 1820 Pleasonton was also appointed to oversee operations of the Treasury's Lighthouse Establishment. As a bureaucrat with little knowledge of maritime matters, and the Lighthouse Establishment being an additional concern, he delegated much of the responsibility of his office to the more directly involved local collectors of customs. Under Pleasonton the collectors became district superintendents of lights, and had the authority not only to select the necessary sites for lighthouse construction, but to also purchase the land for government use. Superintendents also were required to oversee the actual construction of lighthouses, and ensure their repair when necessary. They would also mediate conflicts and deal directly, when necessary, with lighthouse keepers. Each superintendent was required to submit a yearly report detailing the status of light stations in his charge. Pleasonton was a frugal administrator, dispensing funds only when absolutely necessary. While this drew praise from government officials, it came at great expense to existing aids to navigation. Diamond Shoals Lightship incident In 1826, the Diamond Shoals Lightship, off the coast of North Carolina, slipped her moorings in a storm; her anchor and chain were ripped from her hull and fell to the sea floor. Despite being advised otherwise by the local superintendent, Pleasonton waited two months before acting. In the event, he offered a $500 reward for the recovery of both anchor and chain, believing a salvage operation to be more cost-effective than replacing the lost parts (a $2000 cost). Relationship with Winslow Lewis Also typical of Pleasonton's bureaucratic dealings was the relationship with Winslow Lewis. Lewis, a sometime engineer and inventor, had previously developed a new lighting system and won monopoly contracts for their use and the supply of spermaceti oil in American lighthouses along the east coast. Pleasonton agreed to their continuing use, primarily because he viewed it as cost-effective. The system had its detractors, however, including the brothers Blunt, publishers of the American Coast Pilot; they received many irate letters from various mariners, which they forwarded to Pleasonton. Furthermore, although Augustin Fresnel had developed his revolutionary system of lenses in 1820, Pleasonton refused to sanction their use, viewing them as too expensive. He preferred to remain with Lewis' system, claiming that it was adequate for lighting the American coast. According to Robert Browning, chief historian of the United States Coast Guard, it is possible that Pleasonton continued to rely on Lewis's lamps instead of adopting Fresnel lenses at least partially due to the nature of the existing lighthouses. Evidence exists that with the Earth's curvature, the Fresnel lenses would have proved no better than Lewis's paraboloid lamps due to the low height of the lighthouse towers themselves and would not be able to be seen at much greater distances. In the end, it was Pleasonton's refusal to consider Fresnel's system that proved his downfall. This, coupled with his support for Lewis' outdated methods, led to further investigations by Congress; eventually, the United States Lighthouse Board was formed to remove Pleasonton's influence from the system altogether. Death Stephen Pleasonton's gravestone in the Congressional cemetery, Washington, D.C. Pleasonton was 78 years old when he died on January 31, 1855. He is buried in Congressional Cemetery. Legacy Pleasonton's appointment marked a turning point for the Lighthouse Establishment; responsibility for lighthouses had previously shifted from department to department, with no semblance of continuity. His administration lasted until 1852, at which point the United States Lighthouse Board was created; this was the longest period of stability the Lighthouse Establishment had seen up until that point. Still, many historians have criticized Pleasonton's administration, holding that his frugal nature and willingness to cut costs wherever possible did great harm to the Lighthouse Establishment's credibility.

Evidence of pottery has been found in the early settlements of Lahuradewa and later the Indus Valley Civilization. Today, it is a cultural art that is still practiced extensively in Indian subcontinent. Until recent times all Indian pottery has been earthenware, including terracotta. Hindu traditions historically discouraged the use of pottery for eating off, which probably explains the noticeable lack of traditions of fine or luxury pottery in South Asia, in contrast to East Asia and other parts of Eurasia. Large matki jars for the storage of water or other things form the largest part of traditional Indian pottery, as well as objects such as lamps. Small simple kulhar cups, and also oil lamps, that are disposable after a single use remain common. Today, pottery thrives as an art form in India. Various platforms, including potters' markets and online pottery boutiques have contributed to this trend. This article covers pottery vessels, mainly from the ancient Indian cultures known from archaeology. There has also been much figurative sculpture and decorative tilework in ceramics in the subcontinent, with the production of terracotta figurines being widespread in different regions and periods. In Bengal in particular, a lack of stone produced an extensive tradition of architectural sculpture for temples and mosques in terracotta and carved brick. The approximately life-size figures decorating gopurams in South India are usually painted terracotta. Traditional pottery in the subcontinent is usually made by specialized kumhar (Sanskrit: kumbhak√§ra) communities or castes. History Horned figure on pottery from Kashmir. Pr√©-Indus Valley civilization, circa 2700 BC. Mesolithic pottery Cord-Impressed style pottery belongs to 'Mesolithic' ceramic tradition that developed among Vindhya hunter-gatherers during the Mesolithic period.Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute, Volume 49, Dr. A. M. Ghatage, Page 303-304 This ceramic style is also found in later Proto-Neolithic phase in nearby regions. This early type of pottery, found at the site of Lahuradewa, is currently the oldest known pottery tradition in South Asia, dating back to 7,000-6,000 BC. Sothi- Siswal culture Sothi-Siswal is the site of a Pre-Indus Valley Civilisation settlement dating to as early as 4600 BCE.Tejas Garge (2010), Sothi-Siswal Ceramic Assemblage: A Reappraisal. Ancient Asia. 2, pp.15‚Äì40. According to Tejas Garge, Sothi culture precedes Siswal culture considerably, and should be seen as the earlier tradition. Sothi-Siswal culture is named after these two sites, located 70 km apart. As many as 165 sites of this culture have been reported. There are also broad similarities between Sothi-Siswal and Kot Diji ceramics. Kot Diji culture area is located just to the northwest of the Sothi- Siswal area.Asko Parpola, The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization. Oxford University Press, 2015 p18 Sothi-Siswal ceramics are found as far south as the Ahar-Banas culture area in southeastern Rajasthan. Ahar-Banas culture Ahar-Banas culture is a Chalcolithic archaeological culture on the banks of Ahar River of southeastern Rajasthan state in India, lasting from 3000 to 1500 BC, contemporary and adjacent to the Indus Valley Civilization. Situated along the Banas and Berach Rivers, as well as the Ahar River, the Ahar-Banas people were exploiting the copper ores of the Aravalli Range to make axes and other artefacts. They were sustained on a number of crops, including wheat and barley. The design motifs of the seals are generally quite simple, with wide-ranging parallels from various Indus Civilization sites. Indus Valley Civilization Indus Valley Civilization pot from Harappan phase found at Quetta in Baluchistan, c. 2500-1900 BCE. Indus Valley Civilization has an ancient tradition of pottery making. Though the origin of pottery in India can be traced back to the much earlier Mesolithic age, with coarse handmade pottery - bowls, jars, vessels - in various colors such as red, orange, brown, black and cream. During the Indus Valley Civilization, there is proof of pottery being constructed in two ways, handmade and wheel-made. =Rangpur culture= Rangpur culture, near Vanala on Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat, lies on the tip between the Gulf of Khambhat and Gulf of Kutch, it belongs to the period of the Indus valley civilization, and lies to the northwest of the larger site of Lothal. Trail Diggings were conducted by Archeological Survey of India (ASI) during 1931 led by M.S.Vats(madho svarup vats). Later, Ghurye (1939), Dikshit (1947) and S.R.Rao (1953‚Äì56) excavated the site under ASI projects. S.R.Rao has classified the deposits into four periods with three sub periods in Harappan Culture, Period II with an earlier Period, Microlithic and a Middle Paleolithic State (River sections) with points, scrapers and blades of jasper. The dates given by S.R.Rao are: * Period I - Microliths unassociated with Pottery : 3000 BC * Period II - Harappan : 2000‚Äì1500 BC ** Period II B - Late Harappan : 1500‚Äì1100 BC ** Period II C - Transition Phase of Harappa : 1100‚Äì1000 BC * Period III - Lustrous Red Ware Period : 1000-800 BC. =Jhukar and Jhangar Phase= Jhukar Phase was a Late Bronze Age culture that existed in the lower Indus Valley, i.e. Sindh, during the 2nd millennium BC. Named after the archaeological type site Jhukar in Sindh, it was a regional form of the Late Harappan Culture, following the mature, urban phase of the civilization. Jhukar phase was followed by the Jhangar Phase, which is a non- urban culture, characterised by \\"crude handmade pottery\\" and \\"campsites of a population which was nomadic and mainly pastoralist,\\" and is dated to approximately the late second millennium BCE and early first millennium BCE.F.R. Allchin (ed.), The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p.36 In Sindh, urban growth began again after approximately 500 BCE.J.M.

The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC, Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan movements. Together with the Gandhara grave culture and the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Cemetery H culture is considered by some scholars as a factor in the formation of the Vedic civilization. Wilhelm Rau (1972) has examined the references to pottery in Vedic texts like the Black Yajur Veda and the Taittiriya Samhita. According to his study, Vedic pottery is for example hand-made and unpainted. According to Kuzmina (1983), Vedic pottery that matches Willhelm's Rau description cannot be found in Asia Minor and Central Asia, though the pottery of Andronovo culture is similar in some respects.(see Edwin Bryant, Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture, 2001:211-212) =Ochre Coloured Pottery culture= Ochre Coloured Pottery culture (OCP) is a 2nd millennium BC Bronze Age culture of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, extending from eastern Punjab to northeastern Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh.Upinder Singh (2008), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, p.216 It is considered a candidate for association with the early Indo-Aryan or Vedic culture. Early specimens of the characteristic ceramics found near Jodhpura, Rajasthan, date from the 3rd millennium (this Jodhpura is located in the district of Jaipur and should not be confused with the city of Jodhpur). Several sites of culture flourish along the banks of Sahibi River and its tributaries such as Krishnavati river and Soti river, all originating from the Aravalli range and flowing from south to north-east direction towards Yamuna before disappearing in Mahendragarh district of Haryana.Cultural Contours of India: Dr. Satya Prakash Felicitation Volume, Vijai Shankar ≈örivastava, 1981. The culture reached the Gangetic plain in the early 2nd millennium. Recently, the Archaeological Survey of India discovered copper axes and some pieces of pottery in its excavation at the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The Ochre Coloured Pottery culture has the potential to be called a proper civilisation (e.g., the North Indian Ochre civilisation) like the Harrapan civilisation, but is termed only as a culture pending further discoveries. Copper Hoard Culture Copper Hoard Culture occur in the northern part of India mostly in hoards large and small and are believed to date to the later 2nd millennium BCE, although very few derive from controlled and dateable excavation contexts. The doab hoards are associated with the so- called Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) which appears to be closely associated with the Late Harappan (or Posturban) phase. These hoard artefacts are a main manifestation of the archaeology of India during the metals age, of which many are deposited in the \\"Kanya Gurukul museum\\" in Narela and Haryana. Cemetery H culture Painted pottery urns from Harappa, Cemetery H culture, circa 1900-1300 BCE Cemetery H culture was a Bronze Age cultural regional form in the Punjab region and north-western India, from about 1900 BCE until about 1300 BCE, of the late phase of the Harappan (Indus Valley) civilisation (alongside the Jhukar culture of Sindh and Rangpur culture of Gujarat), and it has also been connected with the early stages of the Indo- Aryan migrations. It was named after a cemetery found in \\"area H\\" at Harappa. According to Kenoyer, the Cemetery H culture \\"may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past.\\" Gandhara grave culture Geography of the Rigveda, with river names; the extent of the Swat and Cemetery H cultures are indicated. Gandhara grave culture, also called Swat culture, emerged c. 1600 BC, and flourished c. 1500 BC to 500 BC in Gandhara, which lies in modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan. It may be associated with early Indo-Aryan speakers as well as the Indo-Aryan migration into the Indian Subcontinent, which came from the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana region. According to Kochhar, the Indo-Aryan culture fused with indigenous elements of the remnants of the Indus Valley Civilization (OCP, Cemetery H) and gave rise to the Vedic Civilization. =Black and red ware culture= Black and red ware culture (BRW) is a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age archaeological culture of the northern and central Indian subcontinent, associated with the Vedic civilization. In the Western Ganges plain (western Uttar Pradesh) it is dated to c. 1450-1200 BCE, and is succeeded by the Painted Grey Ware culture; whereas in the Central and Eastern Ganges plain (eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Bengal) and Central India (Madhya Pradesh) the BRW appears during the same period but continues for longer, until c. 700-500 BCE, when it is succeeded by the Northern Black Polished Ware culture.Franklin Southworth, Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia (Routledge, 2005), p.177 In the Western Ganges plain, the BRW was preceded by the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture. The BRW sites were characterized by subsistence agriculture (cultivation of rice, barley, and legumes), and yielded some ornaments made of shell, copper, carnelian, and terracotta.Upinder Singh (2008), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, p.220 In some sites, particularly in eastern Punjab and Gujarat, BRW pottery is associated with Late Harappan pottery, and according to some scholars like Tribhuan N. Roy, the BRW may have directly influenced the Painted Grey Ware and Northern Black Polished Ware cultures.Shaffer, Jim. 1993, Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond. In Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times, ed. H. Spodek and D.M. Srinivasan. p. 57 =Painted Grey Ware= PWG, Sonkh, Mathura, c. 1000-600 BCE. The Painted Grey Ware (PWG) culture is an Iron Age culture of the western Gangetic plain and the Ghaggar-Hakra valley, lasting from roughly 1200 BCE to 600 BCE, which probably corresponds to the middle and late Vedic period, i.e., the Kuru-Panchala kingdom, the first large state in South Asia after the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization.Geoffrey Samuel, (2010) The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, pp. 45‚Äì51Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, 97‚Äì265. It is a successor of the Black and red ware culture (BRW) within this region, and contemporary with the continuation of the BRW culture in the eastern Gangetic plain and Central India.  Northern Black Polished Ware  Map of some NBPW sites. Northern Black Polished Ware (abbreviated NBPW or NBP) is an urban Iron Age culture of the Indian Subcontinent, lasting c. 700‚Äì200 BCE, succeeding the Painted Grey Ware culture and Black and red ware culture. It developed beginning around 700 BC, in the late Vedic period, and peaked from c. 500‚Äì300 BC, coinciding with the emergence of 16 great states or mahajanapadas in Northern India, and the subsequent rise of the Mauryan Empire. Red Polished Ware (Gujarat) Black and Red Ware, Sonkh, Uttar Pradesh. Government Museum, Mathura. The Red Polished Ware (RPW) is found in great quantities in Gujarat, especially in the Kathiawar region.Patel, A. and S.V. Rajesh (2007) Red Polished Ware (RPW) in Gujarat, Western India ‚Äì An Archaeological Perspective. Pr√£gdhar√£ 17 (2006-07): 89-111 Commonly, it consist of domestic forms like cooking pots, and it dates to around first century BC. But this type of ware also is widely distributed in other places in India. It is found at Baroda, Timberva (Surat), Vadnagar, Vala, Prabhas, Sutrapada, Bhandaria, and many other places. The use of this pottery continued for many centuries. Early on, the scholars considered this pottery as a diagnostic marker for ‚ÄòIndo-Roman trade‚Äô, showing the possibility of the Roman empire influence. Also, this type of pottery was identified at sites bordering the Persian Gulf, so it became significant for the research on the Indian Ocean trade. Red Polished Ware was first identified in 1953 by B. Subbarao.Subbarao, 1953: 32 According to him, a \\"high degree of finish led to consider it as an imported ware or at least an imitation of the Roman Samian Ware\\".Sankalia, Subbarao and Deo, 1958: 46-47 > But in 1966 S. R. Rao in his report on Amreli rejected this possibility of a > Roman influence. He insisted on an indigenous origin as none of the forms > shared the shapes of Roman prototype.Rao, 1966: 51 He presented a broad > variety of vessel types consisting of clay suitable to that definition. > Instead he referred to a similarity of vessels of Black Ware with polished > surface [Black Polished ware] from the same site noted in layers beyond the > first occurrence of RPW.Heidrun Schenk, Role of ceramics in the Indian Ocean > maritime trade during the Early Historical Period. In: Sila Tripati (ed.) > Maritime Contacts of the Past ‚Äì Deciphering Connections Amongst Communities, > pp. 143-181. New Delhi: Delta Book World, 2015, academia.edu According to Heidrun Schenk, the pottery defined as RPW consists of two very distinct functional groups. Thus, the subject needs more precise classification and dating. One group belongs to the local pottery development of a region around Gujarat‚Äîmostly domestic vessels like cooking pots. The core area of this group is western India, but it is also distributed elsewhere on the western littoral of the Indian Ocean. The other group are the very specialized types of the 'sprinkler' and 'spouted' water jars, that often go together. This special group is widely found in the eastern region of the Indian Ocean, throughout the South Asian subcontinent and South East Asia with many different fabrics. This group represents a later development continuing well into the Middle Ages. In particular, in Tissamaharama, in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka, a good stratigraphy is found. Early Red Polished Ware is often associated with the Northern Black Polished ware (NBP), and goes back to 3rd century BC. Malwa culture Ceramic goblet from Navdatoli, Malwa, 1300 BCE. Malwa culture was a Chalcolithic archaeological culture which existed in the Malwa region of Central India and parts of Maharashtra in the Deccan Peninsula. It is mainly dated to BCE,P. K. Basant (2012), City and the Country in Early India: A Study of Malwa, p.85 but calibrated radiocarbon dates have suggested that the beginning of this culture may be as early as 2000-1750 BCE.Upinder Singh (2008), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, p.227 the unique aspect of the Malwa culture is they do not use potter‚Äôs wheel instead the whole process is done by hand. Jorwe culture Jorwe culture was a Chalcolithic archaeological culture which existed in large areas of what is now Maharashtra state in Western India, and also reached north into the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh. It is named after the type site of Jorwe. The early phase of the culture is dated to 1400-1000 BCE, while the late phase is dated to 1000-700 BCE. Rang Mahal culture Rang Mahal culture, a post-Vedic culture,Urmila Sant, 1997, Terracotta Art of Rajasthan: From Pre-Harappan and Harappan Times to the Gupta Period, page 59. is a collection of more than 124 sites spread across Sriganganagar, Suratgarh, Sikar, Alwar and Jhunjhunu districts along the palaeochannel of Ghaggar-Hakra River (Sarasvati-Drishadvati rivers) dating to Kushan (1st to 3rd CE) and Gupta (4th to 7th CE) period, is named after the first archaeological Theris excavated by the Swedish scientists at Rang Mahal village which is famous for the terracota of the early gupta period excavated from the ancient theris in the village.Bikaner history Hanna Rydh, 1959,Rang Mahal: The Swedish Archaeological Expedition to India, 1952-1954, page 42. The Rang Mahal culture is famed for the beautifully painted vases on red surface with floral, animal, bird and geometric designs painted in black.Chedarambattu Margabandhu, 1991, Indian Archaeological Heritage: Shri K.V.

Turko-Mughal period The phase of glazed pottery started in the 12th century AD, when Turkic Muslim rulers encouraged potters from Persia, Central Asia and elsewhere to settle in present-day Northern India. Glazed pottery of Persian models with Indian designs, dating back to the Sultanate period, has been found in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Current era Blue Pottery of Jaipur is widely recognized as a traditional craft of Jaipur, though it is Turko-Persian in origin.  Styles  Pottery painting at Kolkata, India. Modern pots for sale in Jaipur, India. Over time India's simple style of molding clay went into an evolution. A number of distinct styles emerged from this simple style. Some of the most popular forms of pottery include unglazed pottery, glazed pottery, terracotta, and papier-mache.  Unglazed pottery  Unglazed pottery, the oldest form of pottery practiced in India, is of three types. First is paper thin pottery, biscuit-colored pottery decorated with incised patterns. Next is the scraffito technique, the matka pot is polished and painted with red and white slips along with intricate patterns. The third is polished pottery, this type of pottery is strong and deeply incised, and has stylized patterns of arabesques.  Glazed pottery  Glazed pottery began in the 12th century AD. This type of pottery often has a white background and has blue and green patterns. Glazed pottery is only practiced in parts of the country.  Terracotta sculpture  Terracotta is the term used for unglazed earthenware, and for ceramic sculpture made in it. Indian sculpture made heavy use of terracotta from a very early period (with stone and metal sculpture being rather rare), and in more sophisticated areas had largely abandoned modelling for using moulds by the 1st century BC. This allows relatively large figures, nearly up to life-size, to be made, especially in the Gupta period and the centuries immediately following it. Several vigorous local popular traditions of terracotta folk sculpture remain active today, such as the Bankura horses.C. A. Galvin, et al. \\"Terracotta.\\", section 5, Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed July 23, 2015, subscription required Often women prepare clay figures to propitiate their gods and goddesses, during festivals. In Moela deities are created with moulded clay on a flat surface. They are then fired and painted in bright colours. Other parts of India use this style to make figures like horses with riders, sometimes votive offerings.

His edition of the Douay Bible with extended commentary, originally published in 1811, became the most popular English Catholic Bible of the 19th century on both sides of the Atlantic. It remains in print and is still regarded for its apologetic value. His eventful early years included a narrow scrape with the French Revolution and a struggle to complete his priestly studies in the years before Catholic Emancipation. He would go on to serve poor Catholic missions in rural England. Father George Leo Haydock (1774‚Äì1849) c. 1800 Early years Mowbreck Hall (Destroyed by fire in the 1960s) Watercolor of Douay College by George Leo Haydock while he was a student there. Crook Hall where George Leo Haydock was ordained in 1798. (The building was demolished ca. 1900) George Leo Haydock was born on 11 April 1774 in Cottam, Preston, Lancashire, the heart of Catholic resistance to the Penal Laws that the English government used to enforce Anglicanism. His parents were George Haydock and his second wife, Anne (n√©e Cottam), who produced a generation that would become outstanding in Catholic service. Their eldest son, James Haydock (1765‚Äì1809), became a priest who died caring for the sick of his congregation during an epidemic; the next, Thomas Haydock (1772‚Äì1859), became a prominent publisher of Catholic books. Among three daughters, Margaret Haydock (1767? ‚Äì 1854), joined the Augustinian nuns, taking the name Sister Stanislaus. George was the youngest son. He and his father were namesakes of an illustrious ancestor, Blessed George Haydock (1556‚Äì1584), a martyred \\"seminary priest\\" during the Elizabethan persecution, beatified in 1987. While attending a school established for Catholic students at Mowbreck Hall, Wesham, George received Confirmation, taking the name Leo, after the fifth-century saint, Pope Leo I, whose liturgical feast was at that time celebrated on Haydock's birthday (see General Roman Calendar as in 1954). In 1785, at eleven years of age, he was sent to further his education at the English College, Douai, (English spelling, Douay or Doway ) France, established in the 16th century for Catholic exiles, where provision was made for secondary education in addition to training for the priesthood. Among his classmates were many who would go on to play significant roles in the English church, including future bishop Thomas Penswick; the future historian John Lingard; and the future Irish Liberator Daniel O‚ÄôConnell. Letter preserved at Ushaw College, Durham from George Leo Haydock to his mother and sister dated 1792, just one year before he would be forced to escape due to the French Revolution Father Haydock's personal prayer book obtained while on the faculty at Crook Hall. It was published by his brother, Thomas. The title, \\"Poor Man's Daily Companion,\\" would be prophetic. In the year following the date of his signature, he would begin serving a series of poor missions in rural northern England. George Haydock's studies were interrupted in 1793, when the French Republic declared war on England and occupied the English College. On 5 August that year, just before the students were expelled and forced into house arrest at a nearby country house, the 19 year old George Haydock managed a harrowing escape back to England in the company of his brother and fellow student, Thomas. Learning from the mistakes of previous escapees, they were able to sneak out of the town via a canal, carrying a fishing rod so they would appear to be on an innocent fishing trip. They went north, walking much of the way until they reached Ostend, whence they crossed to England. Gillow, Haydock Papers,p. 125 et seq. There was an unsettled period while English Catholic bishops made hasty provision for the continuing education in England of the many refugees from Douai. After a stay at St. Edmund's College, Ware, Old Hall Green in Hertfordshire, Haydock was able in 1796 to resume his studies in earnest at a seminary established at Crook Hall, near Consett in County Durham (not to be confused with present-day Crook Hall & Gardens in Durham City). He was ordained a priest there in 1798, and remained as a professor until 1803, when the pastoral phase of his career began. During the period of Penal Laws there was no official Catholic hierarchy in England, so there were no Catholic dioceses or parishes. A Bishop was called a Vicar Apostolic and presided over \\"missions\\" in his jurisdiction. Rev. John Lund (1733-1812), pastor to the Haydock family's home mission at Cottam, was skeptical of young George's prospects for pastoral work, once claiming he and his brother Thomas \\"were chiefly in quest of an easy genteel life.\\"Gooch, p. 254 However, the new priest would quickly prove his mettle, dedicating his career to serve in some of the poorest missions in England. His first assignment was at Ugthorpe, Yorkshire, a poor rural mission, referred to as \\"Purgatory.\\" Despite the legal disabilities of Catholics during this time, the Haydock family had been resourceful enough to retain a measure of local influence and wealth. Although George Leo was the youngest son, he and his older sister Elizabeth appear to have been entrusted with handling the family finances. He demonstrated considerable proficiency in this regard, acquiring investment properties in the areas where he served as pastor as we will see below. He thus had independent sources of income which he often used to subsidize the poor missions he served. The Mission at Ugthorpe UGTHORPE: Father Haydock's first assignment as pastor and where he compiled the notes for his Bible. UGTHORPE: The only building that remains from Haydock's tenure, when it served as a Catholic school Hardly considered a desirable assignment, the small, poor Ugthorpe Mission was nonetheless a challenge enthusiastically met by the young priest. He promptly repaired and improved the existing execrable 1768 thatched roof structure that served as a Catholic chapel and shortly thereafter began planning for a new one. The Catholic Relief Act of 1791, although far from repealing all anti-Catholic legislation, had allowed for the building of Catholic chapels, albeit with severe architectural restrictions. Haydock eventually completed his new chapel and presbytery in 1810, and later added a school, a building that still stands (see picture at left below). He also found time and opportunity to ply his property acquisition and management talents. \\"I have plunged into an ocean of business of farther shores of which I cannot yet descry,\\" he wrote to his family. \\"I propose staying here (God willing) [the] remainder of my days.\\" In the letter he expresses interest in acquiring land to raise cattle and farm grain, wheat, barley and potatoes. He appears to have acquired several pieces of land including rental cottages and a 10 1/2 acre farm which he leased for income. Although he was not destined to remain in Ugthorpe for the rest of his days, he would nonetheless complete his most memorable achievement while serving there. The Haydock Bible Haydock's handwritten manuscript of his Old Testament annotations. Shown here are two of the several hundred pages now in the Haydock Archive at Ushaw College, Durham Haydock's Folio Bible Haydock's tenure at Ugthorpe came during a critical period when the long era of persecution of English Catholics was finally drawing to a close. There was significant agreement even among Protestants that the Penal Laws should be repealed. However, forces opposing repeal were organized for a last ditch effort. According to the historian Lingard (q.v.) ‚ÄúThe [Anglican] clergy have been placed in the front of the battle; and, with the cry of danger to the church has been coupled that of danger to the constitution. To perpetuate religious disabilities, episcopal charges have been published, meetings of the clergy have been held, and petitions from dioceses, colleges and arch-deaconries have been poured into both houses of parliament. In aid of these efforts, the press has also been put into requisition: and the labours of anti-catholic journalists, the establishment of an anti-catholic magazine, and the diffusion of anti-catholic tracts, published in every shape, and adapted to every understanding, bear honourable testimony to the zeal and activity of those who assume the lead in this orthodox crusade.‚Äù Lingard, p. 1 Haydock saw a need to meet this challenge. Since interpretations of Scripture were a significant part of the anti-repeal effort, Haydock set out to complete what would become his Magnum Opus: commentary for a new edition of the English Catholic Bible. That Bible was called the Douay Version (Douay-Rheims Bible), originally translated from the Latin Vulgate in the 16th century chiefly by Gregory Martin, one of the first professors at the English College, Douai (University of Douai). It was revised and newly annotated in the 18th century by Richard Challoner (1691‚Äì1781), a scholar at University of Douai and then Vicar Apostolic of the London District, and later by Father Bernard MacMahon (1736?‚Äì1816). Haydock took his text from the Challoner-MacMahon revision, but added a substantially extended commentary. This commentary was partly original and partly compiled from Patristic writings and the writings of later Bible scholars. It was intended as a counter-offensive to Protestant interpretations. As Haydock states in his Preface, \\"To obviate the misinterpretations of the many heretical works which disgrace the Scripture, and deluge this unhappy country, has been one main design of the present undertaking.\\" First Edition of the Haydock Bible The commentary is extensive in its number of annotations and far ranging in scope. Mostly, the annotations explain words or phrases that are not clear or offer interesting elaborations of the text. However, they also deal with textual and interpretational differences with Protestants and address issues with deists and atheists. In his note to Exodus 20:4, in which the Douay Version mentions \\"a graven thing,\\" Haydock states, \\"Protestants insidiously translate \\"any graven image,\\" [original KJV] though pesel, eidolon, glupton, and sculptile, in the Heb. Gr. and Lat. denote a graven thing or idol......They know that the object of prohibition is the making and adoring of idols. But they probably wish to keep the ignorant under the stupid delusion of supposing that Catholics are idolaters, because they have images...\\" Pointing to the limitations of human knowledge and the resulting need for Faith, he offers in the note to Genesis 1:15, \\"Shall anyone pretend to wisdom, and still call into question the mysteries of faith, transubstantiation, &c.;, when the most learned confess they cannot comprehend the nature even of a grain of sand?\\" He often uses Scripture to justify specific Catholic practices. For example, in his note to Exodus 29:4, which refers to Aaron and his sons being washed with water after entering the door of the tabernacle, he states, \\"It is for this reason we take holy-water, when we go into our chapels, and we wash our fingers before and during Mass.\\" In some cases he makes specific scientific observations. For example, in the note to Genesis 1:14, he states the Earth revolves around the Sun at the speed of 58,000 miles an hour (actual rate is 67,000). He also delves deeply into speculation about the Bible's mysteries. For example, in the note to Genesis 2:8 he states the following regarding the size of the Garden of Eden: \\" How great might be its extent we do not know. If the sources of the Ganges, Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, be not now changed, and if these be the rivers which sprung from the fountains of Paradise, (both of which points are undecided), the garden must have comprised a great part of the world.\\" Annotations to the New Testament are in a similar vein, but were not compiled by Haydock. Given the enormous scope of annotating the entire Bible, he was unable to maintain the demanding production schedule in addition to his pastoral duties at Ugthorpe. Therefore, another Douay alumnus, Father Benedict Rayment (1764‚Äì1842), was called on for assistance.Gillow, Literary History, Vol. III, p. 219 He and a group of colleagues compiled the New Testament portion of the commentary. There was contemporary criticism that haste in preparation of the commentary resulted in some errors. However, given the spartan resources available for Catholic publishing in England at the time, the Haydock Bible must be considered a remarkable achievement. George's brother, Thomas, was the Bible's publisher. Production began in 1811 and was completed in 1814, in a large, folio edition.Cotton, p. 85 et seq. As were many editions of the Bible at the time, Haydock's was published and sold by subscription, a few leaves at a time. Subscribers would accumulate the sets of leaves over the years and ultimately have the completed Bible bound. Different copies have general title pages dated 1811, 1812, 1813 or 1823,Ohlhausen, Haydock Bible after Two Cebturies, p. 27 showing variously Thomas Haydock's Manchester or Dublin locations. English Catholics enthusiastically welcomed this impressive volume that symbolized a reinvigorated Catholicism on the verge of winning its long fight to repeal the Penal Laws. At least 1,500 copies of the first edition were sold. Duties of an English Catholic Priest in Recusant Times Detail from a drawing by George Leo Haydock of his property holdings in Whitby. The reference to \\"Ugthorpe\\" at the upper left apparently indicate he includes his properties there also. WHITBY: Catholic chapel as it appeared in Haydock's day The same scene today behind St. Hilda's Catholic Church. Note the two wall sections are still intact. The old chapel has been pulled down and replaced by a garage After Ugthorpe, Father Haydock's next assignment was at the east coast port of Whitby. While there, he continued his literary career with a series of prayer books (see Other Published Works below), responding to an increasing desire by Catholic congregations to increase participation in the Mass. One book in particular, A Key to the Roman Catholic Office..., is of especial interest. This wide-ranging work includes, among other things, a detailed list of the duties expected of a contemporary Catholic priest as follows: \\"We have frequently to say Mass and the Divine Office, which occupies two hours every day, we are bound to attend to the work of the ministry, to catechize the ignorant, to instruct converts and strayed sheep both in public and in private, to attend for many hours in the cold confessional ( a delightful employment! some dissolute but ignorant people would suppose,) to visit the sick, even those affected with the plague or the most contagious diseases, some of whom live at the distance of 30 or 40 miles from us. We have to preach twice on all the Sabbath Days, (which term denotes all 10-I holidays,) during which, the service lasts about five hours; we have to baptize, prepare people for their first communion, with great solicitude, as well as for confirmation and the last sacrament; we have to perform what is requisite for the solemnization of marriage, and the burial of the dead, privately; we also have to church women, though we do not go to their houses for that purpose ! We keep registers of baptisms, &c.; which are now allowed by the magistrate. All this we perform gratis. Still we have no tithes or surplice fees, which, in the Establishment [Anglican Church], are found so exorbitant. \\"Some of us ( I speak from many years' experience) do not receive from our people ¬£5 a year; nor above ¬£50, including the Salary or Benefice, which has been left by our departed friends often encumbered with weighty obligations. After going through a course of education at the College for about 12 years, which costs annually between ¬£40 and ¬£50, we have to furnish a house and provide the necessary ornaments for the altar; wine, candles, books, &c.; at our own charge, being debarred of any advantages from speculations in trade, or from Matrimony, that our thoughts may be wholly consecrated to the Lord and to the good of our people.\\" While at Whitby he also continued his practice of acquiring investment properties (see diagram at right). Pastoral troubles Also while at Whitby, Haydock continued to serve Ugthorpe as well for most of the period until 1827 when a permanent successor was assigned. At this point, a series of problems began coming to a head. The new Ugthorpe priest, Father Nicholas Rigby (1800‚Äì1886), felt Haydock personally should pay a debt of ¬£284 owed by the Ugthorpe mission. Prior to this, Haydock had disputed the transfer of a ¬£300 donation originally intended for his Whitby mission to the recently established Ushaw College, Durham. Given the generosity Haydock had shown in providing financial support from his own funds to his assigned missions, as well as the history of generous donations by his family, he felt ill-used by these actions. He made his objections known to his superiors, Thomas Smith (1763‚Äì1831), Vicar Apostolic of the Northern Vicariate, and Smith's Coadjutor Thomas Penswick (1772‚Äì1836), a former classmate of Haydock's at Douay; however, they sided against him. Haydock must have considered this especially ironic since he had received a letter from Smith's predecessor in the Northern District, William Gibson (1738‚Äì1821), praising two of Haydock's uncles the \\"greatest benefactors\\" of the College at Crook Hall. One of these had donated ¬£2,200. Haydock's altruistic nature is well-established by his willingness to accept assignments to impoverished missions and his compassion for his flock. However, that nature did not extend to patience with those trying to take financial advantage of him. He made his objections known without mincing words. As a result, an annoyed Smith transferred Haydock to a private chaplaincy at Westby Hall, Lancashire, in 1830. Gillow, Haydock Papers, p. 228 et seq. This was despite a petition by Haydock's Whitby parishioners to Smith expressing \\"regret to hear your Lordship's intention is to remove from us our most worthy and most beloved Pastor The Rev'd Geo Leo Haydock.\\" Haydock's ability to support himself financially was a significant factor in these parishioners' consideration as illustrated by their request, \\"...that your Lordship will take into your serious consideration the depressed state of by far the greatest part of these your petitioners who are not able to contribute any thing towards the support of a Priest.\\" But the petition was ignored, and Haydock's situation would only grow worse. Smith died in 1831 and was succeeded by the sterner disciplinarian Penswick, who immediately interdicted Haydock from his priestly functions.Schofield & Skinner, p. 173 Haydock's older sister Margaret (Sister Stanislaus, O.S.A.), understanding too well her brother's temperament, later admonished him, \\"...keep quiet and silent in regard of your Bishop for I see plainly you will have nothing but vexation and no redress [;] beware of scandal by publishing your sentiments of him.\\" THE TAGG: Detail from a drawing by George Leo Haydock of his home, The Tagg. Despite the \\"pig sty\\" shown at the lower left, he fondly referred to it as \\"The Golden Tagg.\\" Modern street sign on the former site of \\"The Tagg\\" in Cottam While these events were unfolding, English Catholics finally won passage of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. Ironically, just after this victory so long sought after by him and his ancestors, Father Haydock was forced into retirement by his own Catholic superior. In 1831 he dutifully settled at The Tagg (sometimes spelled Tag) in Cottam, a house the Haydock family had retained after an ancestor had sold its larger Cottam Hall estate. Haydock remained there for eight years, \\"devoting himself to study, with his books all around him, lining the walls, and piled in heaps on the floors.\\"Gillow, Haydock Papers, p. 234 In 1832 he made two unsuccessful appeals to Rome of his interdiction. The appeals were sent through a fellow former Douay student and pupil of Haydock's at Crook Hall, Robert Gradwell. Gradwell had served for a time in Rome and had been appointed coadjutor to the Vicar Apostolic of the London District. However, rather than sending the appeals to Rome, Gradwell sent them to Penswick, who ignored them.Gillow, Haydock Papers, p. 239 Another appeal after Penswick's death was successful, resulting in restoration of Haydock's priestly faculties in 1839. The Tagg was pulled down circa 1985. A photograph taken shortly before its demolition shows it to be a two-story brick house with pitched roof and two chimneys. It was left derelict in its final years and has been replaced by a group of modern homes at the corner of Tag Lane and Tanterton Hall Lane in Cottam. There is a nearby street, Cottam Hall Lane, which is a paved over former footpath to the old Haydock ancestral home, Cottam Hall. The name \\"Tagg House\\" still appears on a nearby electrical switching station. Final assignment and death PENRITH: the building that served as a Catholic Chapel in Haydock's day. It is now a gymnasium. The iron fence surrounds the Anglican churchyard from which Catholics were taunted as they went to Mass. St. Catherine's Catholic Church in Penrith today. Haydock is buried under the left side of the chancel. Immediately upon his reinstatement in 1839, Haydock was given a new assignment at Penrith, Cumbria (then known as Cumberland), another poor mission with discouraging prospects. An appeal for donations in The Catholic Directory for that year states \\"‚Ä¶.the congregation is so extremely poor, that unless a generous Catholic public assist with their charitable contributions, the establishment of a mission on a suitable footing, will be impossible‚Ä¶.\\" The appeal goes on to describe the building used as a chapel as being \\"‚Ä¶..too small for the congregation ‚Äì extremely damp, and in every way most inconvenient. The entrance to it is through the [Protestant] churchyard; and the poor Catholics are taunted as they go to mass, with the poverty of their place of worship.\\" Although this was hardly a desirable assignment for a senior pastor with Haydock's experience and abilities, he nonetheless threw himself into the task with his usual zeal. He began maintaining detailed baptismal records, providing fascinating insights into the social conditions of the time and the hardships facing his flock. \\"Laborer\\" is shown as the most common occupation, while \\"beggars,\\" \\"trampers,\\" and one \\"pauper\\" are also represented. In a letter dated 1848, Haydock states, \\"I have baptized above 100[.] But many of them trampers are gone.\\" The second most common position was that of navy navvy or \\"navigator,\\" referring to railroad workers. Irish immigration, especially resulting from the catastrophic Great Famine beginning in 1845, brought a large influx of these to the Penrith area, which was enjoying a wave of railroad construction. An incident of particular note occurred during Haydock's pastorate. Irish navvies were often willing to accept wages less than their native-born counterparts. The obvious potential for hostility came to a head in February, 1846, when conflicts between gangs of Irish and English navvies required intervention by local authorities. At one point, Haydock is credited with dissuading an Irish gang from a planned attack against these authorities, apparently using influence earned from his pastoral work. \\"The presence and exhortations of that aged and amiable man were irresistible, and tranquility was restored.\\" Walker, p. 132 The baptismal records further show Haydock made a careful distinction among parents that were \\"married,\\" \\"perhaps married,\\" \\"Prot[estant] married,\\"and one \\"cohabiting 4 years and wishing to be married.\\" Separately classified also were marriages performed at Gretna Green, a town just across the Scottish border famous for \\"runaway marriages.\\" The problem of infant mortality is sadly chronicled, with several baptisms recorded on infants \\"in articulo mortis,\\" (in danger of death), one who died within a half-hour, and another who died the next day, and \\"the mother soon after.\\" Father Haydock's letters during this period indicate a history of apparent heart disease, a problem that did not slow his endeavors. In September, 1849, just two months before his death, he wrote home describing a plea for help he received from a \\"tramp\\" who appeared near death. To respond he undertook a two-hour horseback ride which evidently precipitated a heart attack. Thinking at first he would die, he nevertheless returned home \\"much shaken.\\" He wrote to his sister, \\"I do not often consult doctors nor do I require any relaxation or to retire to your smug parlor on account of my excessive labour.\\" He continued working zealously at the mission and began construction of a new church, a red sandstone gothic structure named for St. Catherine. He did not live to see its completion, just two months after his death on 29 November 1849. St. Catherine's Church still exists, its congregation now part of the Lancaster Diocese. Father Haydock is believed buried in an unmarked grave under the chancel, although a ground penetrating radar study conducted in 2017 was inconclusive as to the location of any grave there. The original memorial tablet erected in his memory has been lost, but was recently replaced with a copy. It includes his family motto: () from St John 16:20. In 2013 the church built a community centre named in Haydock's honour. A copy of his Bible is on display in the Church, to the left of the chancel near where he is believed buried. Memorial plaque to George Leo Haydock at St. Catherine's Church, Penrith Haydock's enduring legacy 2011 was the bicentennial anniversary of the Haydock Bible. Its substantial and continuing popularity is reflected in its long history of varied editions. It would remain continuously in print until at least 1910 with a long series of publishers in England and America, and would enjoy a renewal of interest at the end of the 20th century, spurring a new series of reprints and modern digital reproductions. Present day Traditional Roman Catholics who see uncertainty of purpose in the post- Conciliar Church have found inspiration in the English Catholic Recusant movement and in Father Haydock's confident expression of Faith. The following history of editions shows how the Haydock Bible with its changes over the years has made a continuing contribution to Catholic apologetics: *1811‚Äì1814: the first edition, folio. Despite successful sales, this expensively produced edition was a financial loss to George's brother Thomas, whose enthusiasm for publishing Catholic books far exceeded his business acumen, and to George, who personally subsidized the project. Despite George Leo's overall proficiency in financial affairs, the achievement he would be most remembered for turned out to be a financial failure. *1822‚Äì1824: an octavo edition. Undismayed by the above experience, Thomas took on several partners to produce this smaller edition. It states on its title page that it is revised and diligently compared with the Latin Vulgate by the Rev. Geo. Leo Haydock. However, it lacks the extended commentary and is poorly printed with many errors, including an egregious one in II Corinthians 10:4, where the word fornications appears in place of fortifications. *1823: In this year a new title page appeared for the folio series, styled \\"Second Edition.\\" It is not truly a new edition, as most of the folio copies were already mixtures of leaves published separately at Thomas Haydock's Manchester and Dublin presses. *1823‚Äì25: the first American edition, folio. The Haydock Bible's popularity quickly spread across the Atlantic. Irish immigrant Eugene Cummiskey of Philadelphia published this edition that remains to this day the only folio Catholic Bible ever published in America. English Quarto Haydock Bible in ornate custom binding *1831: the New Testament portion of the original folio edition issued with a new title page by Thomas Haydock. It is unclear whether he reissued the entire Bible at this time. *1845‚Äì48: a quarto edition begun by MacGregor, Polson & Company of Glasgow and Charles Dolman of London, and completed by A. Fullarton and Co. of Dublin, London, and Edinburgh. This series remained in print with a series of publishers into the 1870s. This was the last edition published during Father Haydock's lifetime. *1852‚Äì54: a quarto edition by American publisher Edward Dunigan and Brother of New York. This edition includes a revised New Testament text. This revision was begun by Father James Bayley (1814‚Äì1877), who was appointed Bishop of Newark during publication, and completed by Father James McMahon (1814‚Äì1901), who was responsible for most of the work. This edition was frequently reissued by a series of publishers into the 1880s. *ca. 1853: a quarto edition by George Henry and Co. of London, and initially distributed in America by George Virtue of New York. In this edition the commentary was abridged by Canon F. C. Husenbeth (1796‚Äì1872). This was the probably the most successful of the Haydock editions, remaining in print through the rest of the century. Circa 1880, The National Publishing Company of Philadelphia imported the stereotype plates from England and mass marketed editions over the imprints of wide range of local booksellers and printing companies, and even got the recently established Montgomery Ward national mail order firm to include it in their catalogue. An extraordinarily large number of copies must have been printed, judging by how frequently surviving copies are met with in the second hand book trade. A copy of this edition was used in the Inauguration of President John F. Kennedy (1917‚Äì1963) in 1961, coincidentally the 150th anniversary of Haydock's first edition. Another copy was used in the inauguration of Vice President Joe Biden. The Kennedy Inaugural Haydock Bible in the Kennedy Memorial Museum, Boston *ca. 1868: a quarto edition by P. O'Shea of New York. Some copies appeared in large (Imperial) quarto. This obscure edition features an abridged version of the commentary. *ca. 1874‚Äì1878: a large (Imperial) quarto edition by Virtue and Company Limited, of London. In this edition, two converts from the Oxford Movement, Frs. Frederick Oakeley (1802‚Äì1880) and Thomas Law (1836‚Äì1904) thoroughly revised the commentary to incorporate advances in Biblical scholarship since Haydock's time. An American edition by P. F. Collier of New York, founder of Collier's Weekly magazine, appeared ca. 1884. British editions remained in print until 1910. *1988: a quarto reproduction of the New Testament portion of the ca. 1853 (George Henry) edition supra by Catholic Treasures, Monrovia, California. *1992: a quarto reproduction of an 1859 reprint of the Edward Dunigan and Brother edition supra by Catholic Treasures, Monrovia, California. This edition has been reissued in 2000, 2006, and remains in print. *1999: a CD entitled Douay Bible 99 issued by Catholic Software of Murray, KY, featuring text and commentary that can be displayed on a computer in a split-screen format. Early American Haydock Quarto Bible Beginning with the ca. 1874‚Äì1878 (Virtue and Company) edition, title pages to the New Testament sections incorrectly credit Father Haydock with the New Testament commentary. For unclear reasons Thomas Haydock wanted Benedict Rayment's contribution kept secret, so it was never mentioned, even in the earliest editions. Therefore, it was forgotten over the years. This error also occurs on the later printings of the ca. 1853 (George Henry) edition. The Haydock name became so popular and so closely associated with English Catholic Bibles in the 19th century that at least one publisher ca. 1886 \\"pirated\\" it for an edition that included only the standard Challoner annotations by adding the statement to the spine of his edition, Challoner's Notes and Other Important Features of the Haydock Bible. During the 1940s and 1950s, some \\"pocket\\" editions of the Catholic New Testament (usually referred to as the Rheims Testament when published separately) appeared, erroneously crediting \\"Canon Haydock\\" with the annotations. Other published works Father Haydock's other publications are brief devotional works. These were so overshadowed by his edition of the Bible and are now so rare, that they are often overlooked. However, modern historian Muchael A. Mullett has pointed out they were a significant part of a liturgical renewal taking place among the growing Catholic recusant population the verge of winning Emancipation. Haydock also wrote lengthier works paraphrasing the Psalms and Canticles of the Roman Office and began a series of Biblical Disquisitions intended as a supplement to his Bible. Regretfully, these were never published, probably due to the erratic fortunes of his brother, Thomas. *Prayers before and after Mass, Proper for Country Congregations, 1822 *A Key to the Roman Catholic Office; Briefly Shewing the Falsehood of Fox's Martyrology, the Invocation of Saints, &c.;, Not Idolatrous; the Meaning of the Litanies, &c.; The Kalendar: Containing a Short Account of the Chief Saints: Their Titles, Countries, & the Year of Their Happy Death: with a Variety of Prayers, etc. etc., 1823 *A Collection of Catholic Hymns, 1823 *A New Collection of Catholic Psalms, Hymns, Motettos, Anthems, and Doxologies. 1823 *The Method of Sanctifying the Sabbath Days at Whitby, Scarborough, &c.;, The Second Edition, with Various Additional Instructions, by the Rev.

The enhanceosome is a higher- order protein complex assembled at the enhancer and regulates expression of a target gene. The binding and assembly of the activating proteins is cooperative due to energetically favorable protein-protein interactions formed in the complex. The best known example of the enhanceosome acts on the human interferon-beta gene, which is upregulated in cells that are infected by viruses. Three activator proteins‚ÄîNF-Œ∫B, an interferon activator protein such as IRF-3, and the ATF-2/c-Jun complex‚Äîcooperatively bind to the upstream enhancer region upon viral infection.

They also assist library patrons in finding information. The widespread use of computerized information storage and retrieval systems has resulted in library technicians assisting in the handling of technical services (such as cataloguing) that were once performed exclusively by librarians. Especially in small village libraries, a library technician may be the only person (or one of only a few) staffing the library. In larger libraries, they may help run certain departments and supervise library clerks, aides, and volunteers. Because libraries are increasingly using new technologies (such as automated databases, CD-ROM, the Internet, and virtual libraries), the role of the library technician is expanding and evolving accordingly. Qualifications Library technicians differ from librarians in terms of education and main duties. Library technicians typically require a diploma, or, ideally, an associate degree in library technology from a community college or other similar institution, whereas librarians require a master's degree in library science from an accredited university-based graduate school of library and information science. Typically a librarian will have had an undergraduate baccalaureate degree in either library science or a field in which they wish to specialize, like history, prior to graduate study. However, for varying reasons, not all librarians are trained yet at the graduate level as professional societies and legal statutes would prefer, and so, as indicated above, sometimes technicians or other individuals with enough training must fill the role. Tasks Library technicians will often carry out the practical tasks involved in daily library operation, whereas librarians generally perform the managerial, supervisory and administrative functions. For example, a librarian may be responsible for creating a library's collection development policies, which would include selection criteria for purchasing of items. A library technician would then purchase items based on these criteria. Library technicians may also be graduates of a four-year college, or institute. They could also be holders of a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree. Because the education of the library technician is practical, broad, and skills-based, they are job-ready upon graduation; the only training they may require is that which is specific to their particular place of employment. Duties can vary with the type and size of the library but can include: cataloguing and classification of materials, data input to assist in acquiring print and nonprint materials, assisting in the provision of reference services, and circulation procedures. In a larger library in government or academia, senior library technicians with specialized and more extensive training (at the baccalaureate degree level) are often responsible for other technicians, clerical staff, student workers, and volunteers in a certain section or department. In smaller libraries, where the foundations of organization and operation are already established, such paraprofessionals sometimes serve as the manager or even the sole staff member. Other duties of library technicians * Shelve material returned and in order in the correct areas. * Shelf read to make sure items are in the correct area. * Sort items and arrange for later use. * Pull materials from stacks. * Register new patrons and update patron information when needed. * Renew patron loans. * Inspect equipment and materials for damage upon return. * Route Inter Library Loan materials as needed. * Make sure item request are properly entered into the circulation system. * Keep availability of reserve items. * Prepare overdue notice reports for administration as directed. * Deliver incoming mail. * Answer and route all incoming phone calls. * Maintain photocopy and computer equipment. * Perform physical maintenance of premises. Library associate/manager A library technician who regularly supervises or serves as library manager and has advanced training is more properly known as a library associate. In the United States, the average salary for an experienced library technician (an associate degree with three to five years of experience) is (in 2017) around $41,000 per year in a good-paying district; those experienced technicians who serve as supervisors or library associates/managers and/or have a baccalaureate degree can earn slightly more. Using the latest information technologies, the goal of library technicians is to bring together people, information, and materials and meet the challenges of a constantly changing information environment. Library technicians work in environments as diverse as business corporations, professional firms, financial institutions, cultural organizations, public libraries, and schools.

Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry (IEPHB) is a facility in Saint Petersburg, Russia, dedicated to research in the fields of biochemistry and evolutionary physiology.  History  The Institute was founded as a research group in October 1950 by Leon Orbeli, a physiologist and a longtime collaborator with Ivan Pavlov. Initially, Orheli's research group included eight people. It subsequently expanded and transformed into the Laboratory of Evolutionary Physiology of the USSR Academy of Sciences, with the main object of studying functions of the nervous system in animals and man during ontogenesis, and also the effects of ionizing radiation on animals. In 1956, the Laboratory became an Institute with Orbeli serving as the first Director of Evolutionary Physiology of the Academy of Sciences. The new Institute was named after Ivan Sechenov. By the end of 1957, the Institute numbered 9 laboratories, one of them being transferred from the former P.F. Lesgaft Institute for Natural Sciences. After Leon Orbeli's death in 1958, the Institute was headed by his collaborator Professor Alexander Ginetsinsky. From June 1960 to March 1975, the Institute was guided by Eugenie Kreps: a former pupil of Ivan Pavlov and collaborator of Orbeli's, Kreps is known for his fundamental studies in the field of comparative physiology and biochemistry of the nervous system. Kreps successfully promoted research in evolutionary biochemistry. In response, in 1964, the Institute adopted its current name, I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry. In November 1969, a monument to Academician Orbeli was erected in front of the first laboratory block on Maurice Thorez Prospect. From 1975 to 1981 Institute was headed by Vladimir Govyrin, and from 1981 to 2004 by Vladimir Svidersky. Since 2004, the Institute has been headed by N. P. Vesselkin, Corresponding Member of RAS, a distinguished neuroscientist, and head of the Laboratory of Neuronal Interaction.  Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology  The Institute is publisher of the Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology (ISSN 0022-0930) which is abstracted in the Chemical Abstracts.

Born in Manhattan of French descent, she spent her youth there and in Paris and eventually made her home near the artist colony in Woodstock, New York. Her paintings, prints, watercolors, and drawings are known for their depiction ordinary people at work and play. They are held by many American museums and private collectors. Early life and education Drawing entitled April by Andr√©e Ruellan, age 8, appearing in The Masses, v. 5, n. 7, April 1914'' Ruellan was born in a brownstone near Washington Square Park in 1905 and was the only child of a couple who had immigrated from France a few years earlier. Her parents encouraged an early talent she showed for making realistic and fanciful drawings. Ardent socialists, they believed the visual arts could help redress the dismissive attitude with which many Americans viewed people who were both less advantaged than themselves and, as they saw it, unpleasantly alien. When she was about eight, they arranged for an amateur artist, Ben Liber, to give her informal instruction and a year later her first published work appeared in the April issue of a socialist monthly, The Masses along with an editorial on religious hypocrisy by Max Eastman. Her drawing, called April, showed an angel scattering flowers above the head of a workman. That same year Ruellan's artwork came to the attention of the Ashcan School painter Robert Henri. He arranged to include some of her watercolors and drawings in a show at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery where he and George Bellows also showed. Over the next few years Ruellan suffered setbacks, first when she was injured in a fire and later when her father died in an accident at work and, while still in her teens, she began selling paintings, watercolors, and drawings to help support herself and her mother. In 1920 she won a scholarship to study at the Art Students League with the painter, Maurice Sterne, and sculptor, Leo Lentelli. Two years later she followed Sterne to Rome on another art scholarship and over the next five years she and her mother remained in Paris where she continued to work and study. During that time she obtained her first solo exhibition at the Sacre du Printemps Gallerie and in 1928 she was given her second one-woman show at the Weyhe Gallery in New York. While in Paris she met and fell in love with the American artist John Taylor. With Ruellan's mother, the pair returned to the United States in 1929 and settled in Shady, a village near Woodstock, New York. Mature style Andr√©e Ruellan, Coal Delivery, an undated drawing, ink and wash on paper, 6 x 5 inches In the 1930s Ruellan developed a style which was social-realist with modernist and abstract elements. Her sympathy for her subjects and her ability to convey a warmth in them is similar to Edward Hopper's or Howard Cook's.name=\\"keyes\\" See, for example, her undated drawing, Coal Delivery, which appears to come from this period. Drawn with ink and wash on paper, it shows an African-American man carrying a heavy bag of coal on his back. He is leaning forward as he places his right foot down and begins to raise the left one. He holds the coal bag with his right hand and leaves his left arm hanging free. The sketch suggests a patient endurance. The composition gives contrasts of diagonal‚Äîfrom left foot to cap‚Äîand vertical‚Äîthe right leg and left arm, the whole showing both the pull of gravity and the energy of forward motion. In work such as this, Ruellan was seen to present social criticism with artistic frankness and little covering up of social facts, but also with empathy and awareness of the value of each person as a specific individual and not simply a generic \\"type\\". One of her best-known works, Crap Game of 1936,Crap Game is held by the Georgia Museum of Art, University of Georgia; it is oil on canvas 22 x 28 inches. is more stylized than other compositions of the same period. As the title suggests, it shows a group of men playing craps. The industrial structures in the background provides what amounts to a stage on which the actions of the game take place. Ruellan normally worked surreptitiously, hiding her sketchbook in a newspaper, or sketching from the window of a car with the sketchbook in her lap. In doing this she insured a high degree of spontaneity in her work, but on this occasion the formality of the composition tempers the immediacy which her work usually shows. She made the sketch while on a trip to Charleston, South Carolina, a place which, she said, was like a \\"whole new world\\" compared to New York and Paris where she had spent her youth. She had been able to spend a month in Charleston because, despite the stock market crash and subsequent depression, Ruellan and Taylor were able to support themselves through art. The Weyhe Gallery in New York had given Ruellan a means of selling her work and Taylor took temporary jobs as art teacher at several universities. By the mid-1930s they had enough money to permit some travel and selected Charleston as destination in hope that it would produce the sort of down-to-earth subjects which they sought. The choice proved to be a good one as one of the paintings which resulted from that visit‚ÄîMarket PlaceMarket Place by Andr√©e Ruellan, oil on canvas, 1939, 28 x 42 inches‚Äîwas the first of hers to be collected by a major museum. The Metropolitan Museum purchased it in 1940. During these years, Ruellan said her practice was to prepare a sketch in the field, develop the sketch into an intermediate form, usually gouache on paper, then create the finished product in oil on canvas. She worked on more than one painting at a time, moving on when she felt she was losing a sense of freshness in her work. When working in oils she thought out composition, balance, movement, and the tension of colors and patterns while retaining as much as possible the informality that was present in the original drawing.Her process is described in full in an article which appeared in American Artist magazine in October 1943. Andr√©e Ruellan, Savannah, c. 1942, oil on canvas, 26 x 36 inches, Telfair Museum of Art, Savannah, Georgia, Museum purchase, 1998.8 ¬© Daniel B. Gelfand In 1941, Ruellan traveled to Savannah with her husband and her mother in order to spend several weeks observing and sketching. The painting she called Savannah dates from this period. Although Savannah is a city, there is no urban bustle and the painting has an almost pastoral appeal. The few figures shown are unhurried. The viewer sees what is clearly a real place at a specific moment of time, but is also aware of an emotionally evocative content: warehouses which are shut up, a man slumped in a doorway. Those who are not burdened by the necessity of manual labor (children, a white man with a cane, loiterers on the dock) contrast with one who is, an African-American pushing a handcart of lumber up the ramp. Savannah Landscape, The City Market by Andr√©e Ruellan, oil on canvas, 26 x 40 inches, circa 1943 A second painting from the trip to Savannah, Savannah Landscape, The City Market, is similar to the harbor view. The light is warm and bright and the colors are warm and muted. The tone is placid and there's a suggestion of timeless continuity, yet the scene is clearly a specific moment in time. Once again there is a distinction between those who perform manual labor, shown at right, and those who do not, including a man in military uniform. A third painting from the trip to Savannah, The Wind-Up,The Wind-Up by Andr√©e Ruellan, oil on canvas, n.d., 20‚Öõ x 30 inches was shown at the Whitney Museum in 1941 and purchased by the Phillips Collection later that year. Showing a sandlot ball game near a gas storage tank and some low-income housing, it depicts players and spectators enjoying weekend downtime. The painting fulfills Ruellan's intention to make works that are both well executed in a technical sense and also have emotional content. In an interview conducted in 1943 she said, \\"People are never just spots of color. What moves me most is that in spite of poverty and the constant struggle for existence, so much kindness and sturdy courage remain. Naturally I want to paint well-designed pictures‚Äîbut I also wish to convey these warmer human emotions.\\"She added: \\"No ivory tower‚ÄîI feel strongly that the artist is an important member of society, and should do his part to build a world where war and poverty, as well as racial discrimination are impossible. I want as good a technic as possible, but only for the purpose of expressing clearly, yet with subtlety, what I feel about life.\\" In 1941‚Äì42, Ruellan made two murals for the Section of Painting and Sculpture of the U.S. Treasury Department, one entitled A Country Saw Mill for the post office in Emporia, Virginia, and the other, called Spring in Georgia, for the post office in Lawrenceville, Georgia.Spring in Georgia is currently located in the R. G. Stephens Federal Building in Athens, Georgia. Created during the early stages of the U.S. participation in World War II, they conformed, broadly, to the we-can-do-it attitude fostered by the government and widely accepted within the country. A Country Saw Mill shows a small steam-driven mill. At right, a worker moves logs into position for sawing while a man with a notebook supervises. At center, men can be seen observing the sawing within the mill and finished lumber is stacked. At far left a man drives a team of horses pulling more logs from the forest which can be seen in the distance. The seven workers in view are African-American while the two supervisors are white. Ruellan prepared sketches on-site, as was her usual practice, and painted the mural in her studio retaining much of the freshness of the scene she had drawn. Andr√©e Ruellan, Spring In Georgia Spring in Georgia shows ordinary people in a rural setting: a woman and a girl tilling a flower garden, a mother with young boy and infant, and a man with a team of mules. The painting conveys a sense of purpose and resourcefulness. It has four roughly equal segments. At left is the flower garden with cozy homestead in the background. Next appears the woman standing with her two children on a strip of grass before a large conifer. The man with his mules, standing on turned earth, drinks a glass of milk or water. At right is a hillside orchard and a stand of trees with two turkeys in the foreground. Ruellan made sketches for the painting in Lawrenceville but it is clear that she did not make the painting from a single drawing but rather constructed it, frieze-like, out of a number of scenes she viewed. The composite nature of the composition draws attention to the painting's symbolic import. Of this symbolism, one critic said \\"the whole has the patchwork quality of abiding memories and not the spontaneity and vitality of an actual scene.\\" Ruellan was represented by Maynard Walker Galleries, New York, from 1936 until 1941 when she switched to the Kraushaar Galleries where she continued for the rest of her life. Her reason for leaving the Walker Galleries had to do with an unwanted association. That gallery was known for showing the work of the leading American Scene paintersThe painters handled by the Walker Galleries included Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry, and Grant Wood Although there were similarities in subject matter, Ruellan did not see herself as a genre painter of this type. She insisted that her subjects be actual people not just representatives of a class of people, a race, or residents of a geographic region. She was also more modernist in her approach and her work showed influences of the French avant-garde not present in theirs. Ruellan signed with the American Artists Group soon after the company's founding in 1936. She contributed works to their catalog in the category called \\"fine art reproductions of museum artists.\\" Both in Paris and New York she made a habit of making circus sketches which she later developed into paintings, gouache, and prints to which American Artists Group purchased reproduction rights. A well-known example of this work is a gouache called Pop! Goes the Weasel. She also made seasonal images for cards and colored advertisements. One of the latter promoted the drinking of beer during the traditional Thanksgiving meal. Called Thanksgiving Dinner, it appeared in 1945 accompanied by text naming it \\"one of a series of typical American scenes painted by America's foremost artists.\\" Later life and work Andr√©e Ruellan, Masques, sugar lift aquatint, 1951, 7 X 6‚Öõ inches Untitled painting (\\"boulders\\") by Andr√©e Ruellan, colored monotype, 10 x 10 inches During World War II and the post-war years, Ruellan's style evolved to become darker and her work began to convey greater tension than before and to show surrealistic tendencies. She appears to have been disillusioned by the devastation suffered by Europeans during and after the war, by the discrimination suffered by her close friend, the Japanese-American artist Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and by her reaction to the extravagant Mardi Gras celebrations which she experienced in New Orleans for the first time in 1948. Ruellan's paintings from this period often contain children in Mardi Gras costumes and masks. They might seem to be playful, but there are disturbing elements in their too-adult attitudes and the segregation of onlookers. Children's Mardi GrasChildren's Mardi Gras by Andr√©e Ruellan, oil on canvas, 1949, 29 x 34 inches, held by the Columbus Museum, Columbus, Ohio of 1949 is one of her best-known works of this period. It shows four children wearing carnival masks and costumes. Their pose suggests an attempt to mimic decadent adult behavior that is associated with Mardi Gras. Behind them, four uncostumed children peer through a grating on the top of a wall and another is seen through a metal-wire barrier. Of the four costumed children, one pair are dancing together. The two appear again in Ruellan's Masques of 1951, a sugar lift aquatint print. The composition of the print resembles that of her drawing, Coal Delivery. In both works the figures are moving from left to right, glancing downward and in both one sees the same diagonal and vertical lines of force. However, in tone the two works are distinctly different from one another. In Coal Delivery the viewer is led to share the artist's empathy with her subject while in Masques the viewer senses the discordance of the scene. In the latter, there is no youthful exuberance, nothing like the quiet resilience and sturdy courage conveyed by the former. In the mid-1950s, Ruellan's work began to brighten again. She did not return to the social realism of the 1930s, but, following a trip to France, her art became increasingly abstract. At about that time she began to do sumi ink wash painting which proved to be a useful tool in merging representational fragments into an overall abstract approach. Seed Dates of 1960 (15 x 24 inches) is an example of her sumi work. It shows a stalk of dates lying on an undifferentiated flat surface. Her most abstract work came after a stay in Florida during the early 1960s. An untitled colored monotype from that period, which is informally called \\"Boulders\\",\\"Boulders\\" by Andr√©e Ruellan, undated and untitled colored monotype, 10 x 10 inches. while clearly revealing its subject, nonetheless shows sympathy the art of the Abstract Expressionists and is both brighter and freer than her work in the post-war period. In these paintings the panels of color are elements of design as much as objects in nature.In an essay accompanying the retrospective exhibit of her work in 2005, Andrew Ladis writes, \\"Never having abandoned nature, Andr√©e Ruellan returned, in the end as in the beginning, to her enduring source of inspiration: the visible world, as perceived by sensing eyes and recollected in the matrix of a resourceful memory, a world whose incidents and emotions she renders with a skilled hand.\\" (Ladis, Andrew, \\"Andr√©e Ruellan, Ever Young,\\" Georgia Museum of Art, 2005.) Personal information Ruellan's father, Andr√© (also known as Andrew), worked in the aviation industry as a pilot and mechanic. He had hoped to become a sculptor, but found he could not support his family by that means. Her mother was Lucette Lambert (also called Louise). Both parents were born and raised in France. In about 1900, their socialist politics and pacifist beliefs led them to migrate to New York so that Andr√© would not be drafted into the French army. Ruellan was born in a brownstone building in New York's Greenwich Village on April 6, 1905. She was an only child. French was the language spoken at home and thus was her first language. In 1952, Ruellan was described as a petite brunette. When Ruellan was about 12 she was injured in a fire and shortly thereafter the family moved from Manhattan to Mineola, Long Island. A few years later, in 1920, Andr√© died in an airfield accident. Ruellan and her mother returned to Manhattan and Ruellan obtained scholarship aid to develop her skills so as to help support herself and her mother. Following the death of her father, she and her mother remained together for the rest of their lives. During the 1920s, they resided together in Paris. In 1929, Ruellan met, and three months later, married John W. Taylor. Returning to the United States, the three lived together in a farmhouse Taylor had purchased in Shady, New York. They resided there until their deaths. Ruellan and Taylor had determined to support themselves via their art and Lucette agreed to take on the management of their household so as to give them more time for their work. She also accompanied them on their travels. John Taylor was also known as Jack Taylor, John Williams Taylor, and John W. Taylor. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1897, and died in Shady, New York, in 1983. Ruellan provided income through sale of artworks and Taylor did the same while also taking temporary jobs teaching college-level art courses. Ruellan and Taylor were active participants within the artists' colony at Woodstock and she continued to produce art well into her eighties.  Longevity  At 95 years old Andree was quoted as saying, \\"If you have talent, don't neglect it. One of my great life joys was marrying an artist who was my equal. It made my life so much richer than those of most of my friends.\\" She died July 15, 2006, at the age of 101 at an extended care facility in Kingston, New York.

It is situated directly east-southeast of the village of Braunton, in North Devon. The parish lies on the north bank of the estuary of the River Taw and it is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Braunton, Marwood, Ashford and across the estuary, Fremington. The population was 418 in 1801 and 404 in 1901. Its largest localities are Wrafton and Chivenor. The surrounding area is also an electoral ward with a total population at the 2011 census of 2,673. St Augustine's Church The parish is within Barnstaple Deanery for ecclesiastical purposes.See typescript Church Notes by B. F. Cresswell, arranged by deaneries, held in the Westcountry Studies Library The parish church is dedicated to St Augustine, who brought Christianity to England. It is a Grade I listed building and has three listed monuments in its churchyard. Parts date to about the 13th century. It has a bell-tower at the west end, with embattled parapet with crocketted corner pinnacles. The nave contains Tudor arched doorways and a five-bay arcade. The sundial over the south porch, dated 1795, is by John and Thomas Berry. An ornate Easter Sepulchre tomb in the chancel is to Richard Coffin (1456‚Äì1523), Sheriff of Devon in 1511. The church has monuments to the Ballyman family and to the Basset family, lords of the manor, situated in the Basset Chapel, at the east end of the north aisle, now almost fully occupied by the organ. Commonwealth War Graves Heanton Punchardon is one mile from Chivenor and during World War II, the parish church, St. Augustine's churchyard was enlarged to accommodate a war graves plot on new ground. The churchyard contains two burials of the First World War and 85 from the Second World War. It also has 38 post-war Royal Air Force burials and one Italian war grave.

Rev. John Swete described the house in spring 1796 as \\"the seat of Col. Basset\\" and wrote of it that \\"The house exhibits itself handsomely though its situation (like that of Lord Heathfield's on the Exe [i.e. Nutwell]) seems to be too contiguous to the water.

The first compilation was edited by Eberswind, first abbot of Niederaltaich, in 741 or 743. Duke Odilo, founder supplemented the code around 748. It is one of the most well documented bodies of Germanic tribal law. Parts of the Lex Baiuvariorum are identical with the Visigothic Code of Euric and from the Lex Alamannorum. The Bavarian law, therefore, is later than that of the Alamanni. It dates unquestionably from a period when the Frankish authority was very strong in Bavaria, when the dukes were vassals of the Frankish kings. Immediately after the revolt of Bavaria in 743, the Bavarian Duke Odilo was forced to submit to Pippin the Younger and Carloman, the sons of Charles Martel, and to recognize the Frankish suzerainty. About the same period, too, the church of Bavaria was organized by St Boniface, and the country divided into several bishoprics; and we find frequent references to these bishops (in the plural) in the law of the Bavarians. On the other hand, we know that the law is anterior to the reign of Duke Tassilo III (749-788). The date of compilation must, therefore, be placed between 743 and 749.Note, though, in Fosberry, John trans, Criminal Justice through the Ages, English trans. John Fosberry. Mittelalterliches Kriminalmuseum, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, (1990 Eng. trans. 1993) p.8 the author states > \\"The research work of Konrad Beyerle indicates that the Benedictine > monastery at Niederaltaich on the Danube played an important part in the > drafting of this lex...which was established in 741. It seems highly > probably that the Lex Baiuvariorum was compiled between 730 and 744, that > is, presumably under the rule of the Bavarian duke Odilo.\\" > >> Wilhelm St√∂rmer claims that though the Lex Baiuvariorum uses some identical titles as Visigothic and Alamani texts, synodal texts and the Tradition Book of Freising indicate that it cannot simply be a copy. K. Reindels claims that the law could have been developed in stages, starting with the reign of Theudebert I (539‚Äì548) until we have the version that we know today created during the reign of Odillo. What is certain is that the Lex Baiuvariorum was created at the behest of the Frankish overlords. The Lex Baiuvariorum consists mostly of individual acts the penalty in cash to be paid to the victim or the victim's family as well as the public treasury. Many of the extant manuscripts are in a small format, a clear indication that the lawbook was at hand when the lord held court. The text is written in Latin. The Lex Baiuvariorum is divided into 23 titles. Titles 1‚Äì6 regulate the law of the different social ranks. Titles 7-23 offer legal rulings on criminal and private law. * Title I: Protection of the church, spiritual men, its people and property including servants and wards. * Title II: Protection of the duke, his office, and his military operations. * Title III: Stipulates the Agilolfings as the leading noble family from which the rulers of Bavaria are chosen. The other noble families explicitly mentioned are: Anniona, Fagana, Hahilinga, Huosi and Trozza (sometimes also spelled \\"Drozza\\"). * Title IV: The protection of the free. Under free, the Lex Baiuvariorum makes a distinction between those who are free and those who have been set free. Fines for breaking the law varies depending on the status of the individuals involved: free, set free, and unfree. * Title VIII: On Women and their Legal Causes that often occur. First and foremost, addresses the fines and instances of justified homicide incidental to acts of female (free or bonded) infidelity and adulterous acts.

He is a left-handed opening batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. He played Minor Counties cricket during 1999 for Dorset before entering first- class cricket in 2000 with Hampshire. For Dorset, he was a member of the team that reached the final of the 1999 Minor Counties Championship. He scored 196 in the second innings of the match after Dorset had been forced to follow on by Cumberland, but Cumberland still won the game by six wickets. Sexton played only four first-class matches for Hampshire. In his first game against Durham, he scored 36 out of a total of 340 that included no individual 50s.

His goal was to create a pattern that eclipsed the splendid Renaissance-Baroque metalwork of Benvenuto Cellini, court artist and sculptor in the court of King Francis I who ascended the French throne in 1515. It took him three years to design. The pattern is unique, given that - unlike other flatware patterns - it has fifteen different fruit-and-flower clusters. Each handle bears one of these detailed designs. It has been claimed that the design idea came from one of the many tableware patterns of the Italian silver manufacturer Cesa 1882.

The highway runs from an entrance to Fort George G. Meade north to MD 176 in Hanover. In addition to serving as an access point to the U.S. Army installation, MD 713 provides the primary access to the Arundel Mills regional shopping mall and the Live! Casino & Hotel. MD 713 was constructed as part of MD 175 in the late 1920s and received its present designation in the mid-1940s. The northern end of the highway was relocated in the mid-1990s for the construction of MD 100 and modified again when Arundel Mills was built a few years later. One of MD 713's auxiliary routes connects the mall and casino with MD 295 via the first diverging diamond interchange in Maryland. Route description View south along MD 713 in Severn MD 713 begins just north of the Rockenbach Road entrance to Fort Meade. The state highway heads north as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane to its intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in the hamlet of Provinces. MD 713 heads north from MD 175 as two-lane undivided Ridge Road through residential subdivisions. At Stoney Run Drive, the state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway and enters a commercial area. MD 713 passes Ridge Chapel Road, part of the old alignment of MD 713, before reaching an intersection with Arundel Mills Boulevard, which heads southwest to an interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), and Arundel Way, an entrance to Arundel Mills and the Live! Casino & Hotel. MD 713 turns north onto Arundel Mills Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway, toward an interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The state highway reaches its northern terminus just north of the MD 100 interchange at MD 176 (Dorsey Road). New Ridge Road continues straight as a county highway toward a collection of industrial and business parks in Hanover. History Ridge Road was constructed as a concrete road between Provinces and MD 176 in 1929. The highway was originally the easternmost part of MD 175. MD 713 was assigned to Ridge Road by 1946 after MD 175 had been extended southeast toward Odenton. MD 713 was widened between MD 175 and MD 176 in 1951. The highway was extended south from MD 175 to its present terminus at the entrance to Fort Meade in 1967. MD 713 was relocated and expanded to a multi-lane divided highway from south of Ridge Chapel Road to the intersection of New Ridge Road and Ridge Road north of MD 176 in 1995 in conjunction with the construction of MD 100 and the interchange between the two highways. A section of New Ridge Road remained part of MD 713 until the state highway was truncated at MD 176 in 1999. The old alignment of Ridge Road became part of MD 713B (Ridge Chapel Road) and all of MD 713C (Teague Road) south of MD 100, and MD 713D (Ridge Road) north of MD 100 to MD 176. The newly relocated section of MD 713 was relocated again in 2000 with the construction of Arundel Mills Boulevard to create a four-way intersection between the boulevard, the Ridge Road segment of MD 713, and an entrance to Arundel Mills, which opened the same year. Junction listAuxiliary routes MD 713 has five unsigned auxiliary routes and one former auxiliary route. MD 713A through 713E are associated with the construction of MD 100 through Hanover in the 1990s. MD 713F was assigned as part of the project to connect Arundel Mills Boulevard with MD 295. *MD 713A was the designation for a state-maintained section of Clark Road west from MD 713 just south of Arundel Mills Boulevard. MD 713A was transferred to private ownership and removed from the state highway system in 2008. *MD 713B is the designation for the L-shaped state- maintained portion of Ridge Chapel Road. The highway heads north from MD 713, then turns east at the southern end of MD 713C (Teague Road) and reaches its eastern terminus at an entrance to Harmans Park, which contains Joe Cannon Stadium, a local baseball venue named for Joseph Jerome Cannon, a major league baseball player who grew up in Anne Arundel County. The north-south part of MD 713B is the old alignment of MD 713. *MD 713C is the designation for Teague Road, a section of the old alignment of MD 713 between MD 713B and a cul-de- sac adjacent to MD 100. MD 713C also provides access to Joe Cannon Stadium. *MD 713D is the designation for Ridge Road, a section of the old alignment of MD 713 between a dead end adjacent to MD 100 and MD 176. *MD 713E is the designation for the state-maintained section of Ridge Road on both sides of the road's intersection with New Ridge Road north of MD 176. *MD 713F is the designation for the section of Arundel Mills Boulevard through its diverging diamond interchange with MD 295. The interchange was constructed as a dumbbell interchange in 2001 and designated MD 713F in 2002. The interchange was transformed into Maryland's first diverging diamond interchange in June 2012 to better serve the surge in traffic expected from the opening of the Maryland Live! casino at Arundel Mills that same month.

The law is thus a compromise between the traditional customs and statutes of the pagan Saxons and the established laws of the Frankish Empire. The Lex Saxonum has come down to us in two manuscripts and two old editions (those of B. J. Herold and du Tillet), and the text has been edited by Karl von Richthofen in the Mon. Germ. hist., Leges, v. The law contains ancient customary enactments of Saxony, and, in the form in which it has reached us, is later than the conquest of Saxony by Charlemagne. It is preceded by two capitularies of Charlemagne for Saxony, the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae (A. Boretius i. 68), which dates from either 782 or 795,Yitzhak Hen, \\"Charlemagne‚Äôs Jihad\\", Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 2006 and is characterized by great severity, death being the penalty for every offence against the Christian religion; and the Capitulare Saxonicum (A. Boretius i. 71), of the 28 October 797, in which Charlemagne shows less brutality and pronounces simple compositions for misdeeds which formerly entailed death. The Lex Saxonum apparently dates from 803, since it contains provisions which are in the Capitulare legi Ribuariae additum of that year. The law established the ancient customs, at the same time eliminating anything that was contrary to the spirit of Christianity; it proclaimed the peace of the churches, whose possessions it guaranteed and whose right of asylum it recognized.

The suburb lies to the north of the city centre and is largely residential, including the University of Southampton's Glen Eyre Halls of residence complex (including Chamberlain), which houses around 2,100 students. Bassett gives its name to part of the A33 arterial road which links the city centre to the M3, described by Pevsner & Lloyd as \\"part of the splendid tree-lined route into Southampton from Winchester, London and the north\\". The highest point in the City of Southampton (its \\"county top\\") lies on Bassett Avenue at a height of above sea level. Bassett Ward comprises Bassett, Bassett Green and Lordswood. It had a population of 14,532 at the 2011 census. History Ordnance Survey map of 1935 showing locations of Bassett and Bassett Green.

By the time of the Ordnance Survey of 1897, Basset had been renamed Bassett Green (with a double 't'), and a more westerly area (west of Bassett Wood) was identified as Bassett.Ordnance Survey, 1897 By the late 19th century, Bassett consisted of many substantial villas occupied by the middle classes. Despite having the appearance of a well-to-do district on the edge of the town, Revd. Elliott Kenworthy-Browne (rector of North Stoneham from 1886 to 1912) observed that three-quarters of the population of 800 were poor, chiefly mechanics and labourers. In 1920 the boundaries of Southampton were extended to include Bassett, along with Bitterne, Sholing, Woolston, Weston, Peartree and Swaythling.Lambert: \\"A brief history of Southampton\\"  Government  Along with the adjacent neighbourhoods of Bassett Green and Lordswood, Bassett forms part of the Bassett Ward of Southampton, which had a population of 13,139 at the 2001 census. Councillors for the ward are elected to Southampton City Council, which is a unitary authority and therefore the only tier of local government covering the neighbourhood. Nationally, Bassett falls within the Romsey and Southampton North constituency for the UK parliament and the South East England constituency for the European Union parliament.  Geography  Bassett is primarily urban or suburban in nature but is sandwiched between Southampton's two largest open spaces; Southampton Common to the south and Southampton Sports Centre to the north. The main shopping area of the neighbourhood is located where three major roads meet; Hill Lane (the main road from Bassett to the city centre), Winchester Road and Burgess Road (both major east-west routes across the city). The shops there include a well- established pharmacy, Bassett Tea Rooms, and a butcher, Uptons of Bassett. Upton's frequently appear in regional and national butchery competitions; in 2014 they were named supreme champions in the Great Hampshire Sausage & Pie Competition.  Landmarks  This residential care home stands on the site of the Bassett Hotel The Bassett Hotel at 111 Burgess Road dated from before 1871 and was by that year owned by Coopers Brewery, subsequently taken over by Watney Combe & Reid. It became a popular music venue, with its back room housing a jazz club, the Concorde Club, which subsequently moved to separate premises in North Stoneham. While located at the Bassett Hotel, the club was the scene of early performances from the likes of Chris Barber, Joe Cocker and Manfred Mann. The hotel's bar was also visited by Ken Russell on his way to an infamous television interview for the Viewpoint programme; after drinking at least four scotches at the Bassett, Russell initially went to the wrong television studio and when he reached the correct one he failed to answer any questions. The hotel underwent an ¬£80,000 refurbishment in 1972 and was relaunched as a Berni Steak House. It was later sold to Whitbread who turned it into a Beefeater restaurant and subsequently a Brewers Fayre before it was closed. The hotel was acquired by Sunrise Senior Living who demolished it and built a residential care home on the site. Education Primary-age children in Bassett tend to attend local schools in adjacent neighbourhoods, such as Bassett Green, Shirley and Lordswood. Bassett is also close to two large secondary schools; Cantell School in Bassett Green and Regents Park Community College are roughly equidistant from the focal point of Bassett (the junction of Hill Lane and Winchester Road). The University of Southampton's distinctive Boldrewood Campus buildings are situated just off Bassett Avenue, at the eastern extremity of Bassett. The campus housed the Biomedical Sciences Centre until its closure in 2010. It has now been replaced by a joint centre for the University of Southampton and Lloyd's Register, completed in 2014.\\"Grimshaw to establish much-needed cornerpiece to Southampton University's Boldrewood Campus\\" Retrieved 20 September 2011 Religious sites St. Michael & All Angels Church, Bassett Bassett was originally part of the parish of North Stoneham, which can be traced back to the early 9th century when it was known as \\"Stonam Abbatis\\" or \\"Abbots Stoneham\\", and was attached to Hyde Abbey at Winchester. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1540s, the manor was acquired by Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In 1599, the Wriothesley family sold the estate to Sir Thomas Fleming. With the growth of Bassett came the construction of a second church within the parish, located on Bassett Avenue. The foundation stone for the new church was laid in 1897 and St Michael and All Angels Church is now a \\"Grade II listed building\\". The parish has since been renamed \\"North Stoneham and Bassett\\", and encompasses the whole of Bassett, the portion of Bassett Green north of Bassett Green Road, North Stoneham, and the portion of Chilworth within the M3/M27 triangle. The parish also covers Southampton Airport. All Saints Church on Winchester Road was inaugurated in 1970 to serve the needs of the western edge of the parish. Sport Southampton Sports Centre (with the Snowsports Centres visible at the rear) Bassett is home to several of Southampton's main sports facilities: Southampton Sports Centre The centre is a 150-acre site with facilities for football, netball, cricket, cyclo cross, cross country, athletics, tennis, bowling, volleyball, crazy golf, putting, and hockey. The area has been used for the Millennium Youth Games, National Cyclocross Championships and to hold outdoor classical concerts.Southampton City Council\\" Southampton Snowsports Centre The centre has three dry ski slopes: a main slope of 110 metres; a second slope of 90 metres and a nursery slope of 30 metres long.

It offered high-speed network products for the scientific computing market as well as some commercial companies. It was founded in 1986 by James N. Perdue (formerly of NASA, Ames Research Center), Drew Berding, and Wes Meador (of Control Data Corporation) to provide higher speed connectivity and networking for supercomputers and their peripherals and workstations. At the time, the only other companies offering high speed networking and connectivity for the supercomputer and high-end workstation market was Network Systems Corporation (NSC) and Computer Network Technology Corporation (CNT). They both offered 50 megabytes per second (MB/s) bandwidth between controllers but at that time, their architecture was not implemented using standard networking protocols and their applications were generally focused on supporting connectivity at high speed between large mainframes and peripherals, often only implementing only point-to-point connections. Ethernet was available in 1986 and was used by most computer centers for general networking purposes. Its bandwidth was not high enough to manage the high data rate required by the 100 MB/s supercomputer channels and 4 MB/s VMEbus channels on workstations. Ultra's first customer, Apple Computer, purchased a system to connect their Cray 1 supercomputer to a high speed graphics framebuffer so that Apple could simulate new personal computers on the Cray Research computer (at the hardware level) and use the framebuffer as the simulated computer display device. Although not a networking application, this first contract allowed Ultra to demonstrate the basic technologies and gave them capital to continue development on a true networking processor. In 1988, Ultra introduced ISO TP4 (level 4 networking protocol) as part of their controllers and implemented a type of star configuration network using coax and fiber optic connections. They called this product, UltraNet. They later offered a fast version of TCP/IP in their controllers, as this protocol was most frequently encountered in an actual computer center network environment. The clock rates on the Ultra network processors provided 250 Mbit/s transfer rates and four of these could be connected together to achieve one gigabit per second transfer rates for a single logical connection. Effective transfer rates between Silicon Graphics and Sun Microsystems workstations exceeded 4 MB/s using one 250 Mbit/s physical connection, a factor of over 10 to 12 greater than then current Ethernet connections and often exceeded the effective transfer rates of the competing NSC and CNT connections in similar applications. Customers with dual Cray computers measured the connections between Cray processors over the UltraNet that exceeded 80 MB/s effective transfer rates. Ultra Network Technologies products included network cards for workstations and mini-supercomputers using VMEbus connectors and fiber optic cable for the network physical connections, host network cards which resided in the network hub for Cray Supercomputers, IBM mainframes, mini- supercomputers from Convex Computer, HIPPI standard channel, and others. There were two sizes of high speed network hubs that contained the mainframe host cards plus the fiber optic network hub to network hub cards. The network topology was in the form of connected hubs. Engineers at the Stuttgart University computer center demonstrated long distance connections using German PTT provided fiber optics of effective transfer rates over 4 MB/s up to an 800 km distance. Later products incorporated TCP/IP network protocols in their processors. A typical network configuration of several workstations and a single mainframe host could cost $250,000. A configuration with many workstations and two or three mainframe computers could reach $1 Million. The company grew to about 140 employees at its high point. Its headquarters was located at 101 Daggett Drive, San Jose, CA with other offices in Dallas, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington DC, D√ºsseldorf, Germany, and Paris, France. In 1992, the company was abandoned by its investors and sold due to an inability to become profitable and the advent of less expensive network technologies, mainly created by the advent of the higher speed personal computers and lower cost workstations used in the scientific labs; the buyer was Computer Network Technology Corporation of Plymouth, Minnesota (NASDAQ: CMNT). The company's Chairman of the Board was M. Kenneth Oshman, formally chairman of ROLM Corporation, and President was Stan Tenold, previously the president of ROLM's Military Products division. The company's various customers included many high-end computer centers, including, several NASA sites, NSA, US Air Force, US Navy, Aramco, France's EDF, Pittsburg Supercomputer Center, University of Stuttgart, Leibniz University Hannover, Apple Computer, Houston Chronicle, and many other such high end computer users.

She was based at Sitka, Alaska for 16 years and is currently homeported at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Her primary mission is maintaining aids to navigation, but she also supports search and rescue, law enforcement, oil spill response, and other Coast Guard missions.  Construction and characteristics  Maple was built by the Marinette Marine Corporation on the Menominee River in Wisconsin. She was launched on December 16, 2000. She was christened by Fran Ulmer, Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. She was the seventh of the fourteen Juniper-class ships launched. Her original cost was reported as $30 million. Maple's hull is constructed of welded steel plates. She is long and has a beam of . She is capable of maintaining a sustained speed of 15 knots. The ship has thirteen diesel fuel tanks capable of holding 74,498 gallons. Maple has an unrefueled range of 6,000 miles at 12 knots. Maple has a single variable-pitch propeller that is powered by two Caterpillar 3608 Diesel engines, each with an indicated 3,100 shp. There are two electric maneuvering thrusters, the bow thruster producing 460 hp and the stern thruster producing 550 hp. The thrusters act as part of a dynamic positioning system that is capable of maintaining the ship within five meters of a fixed position on the sea in winds up to 30 knots and seas up to . This allows the crew to work on buoys in difficult weather conditions. The ship's crane extends to and can lift onto her buoy deck, which is 2,875 square feet in area. This capability has allowed Maple to service NOAA's 6-meter NOMAD weather buoys, which weigh 25,000 pounds. Maple is capable of light icebreaking. She can sail through ice thick at three knots. Maple is armed with two 50-caliber machine guns and a variety of small arms for boarding operations. Her complement is seven officers and forty-six enlisted personnel. Maple and all but one of the Juniper-class buoy tenders are named after trees. She is the third Coast Guard vessel of this name, after USLHT Maple, launched in 1893, and USLHT/USCGC Maple (WAGL-234), launched in 1939.  Operating history  alt= After her launch, Maple sailed down the Great Lakes and out into the Atlantic through the Saint Lawrence Seaway. During the trip she stopped in Ogdensburg, New York the former homeport of her predecessor, Maple (WAGL-234). This Maple arrived in Sitka, Alaska, her first homeport, on September 29, 2001. She was commissioned there on October 19, 2001 with her sponsor, Lieutenant Governor Fran Ulmer, speaking again. The ship replaced USCGC Woodrush at that station. Her primary mission was servicing aids to navigation. The diversity of activities within this mission is suggested by a six-day patrol in October 2008. She recovered a buoy that was adrift in Peril Strait, decommissioned 18 seasonal buoys in Prince William Sound, repaired a light in Tenakee Inlet on Chichicoff Island, and saved a fishing boat from going aground. In addition to maintianing navigation buoys, Maple partnered with NOAA to service offshore weather buoys. In 2013 she partnered with USGS to deploy ocean-bottom seismometers to study earthquake behavior in Southeast Alaska. Maple also supported search and rescue mission. In May 2004 the ferry LeConte went aground on Cozian Reef on her way to Sitka. Maple and USCGC Anacapa responded to the scene. In September 2004 Maple was dispatched as part of a large, unsuccessful effort to find an aircraft that was lost with five people aboard. A light oil sheen was found on Peril Strait and it was hoped that Maple's side-scan sonar might locate the wreck on the sea bottom. Aircraft spotted a drifting barge 60 miles southeasst of the Kenai Peninsula in September 2006. Maple intercepted the craft, which was long, and found that it was abandoned and empty, with no identifying marks as to its origin. On July 12, 2017 Maple left Sitka for the last time. She sailed for a mid-life overhaul at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland via the Northwest Passage across the top of Alaska and Canada. She was only the sixth Coast Guard vessel ever to have completed the transit. She was accompanied over much of the route by Canadian icebreakers and research ships including CCGS Sir Wilfred Laurier, CCGS Amundson, and CCGS Terry Fox. While the scheduled overhaul was the driver of the trip, scientific objectives were met along the way. Maple hosted a scientist from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on the passage. The ship arrived in Baltimore on August 28, 2017. After Maple reached the Coast Guard Yard, her crew was transferred to USCGC Kukui, which had just completed her mid-life overhaul. They sailed their new vessel back from Baltimore to Sitka via the Panama Canal, completing a circumnavigation of North America, in July 2018. Kukui replaced Maple at Sitka on a permanent basis. USCGC Maple practices vertical replenishment in 2004 Maple was the fourth Juniper-class cutter to receive her mid-life overhaul under of the Coast Guard's In-Service Vessel Sustainment program. The goal of the work was to extend the ship's life for another 15 years. During her upgrade much of her deck equipment, machinery control, propeller, and HVAC systems were overhauled. Corroded steel was replaced. Maple left the Coast Guard Yard on November 7, 2018. She arrived at her new homeport, Atlantic Beach, North Carolina in November 2018. She replaced USCGC Elm at this station. Her primary mission is maintaining over 200 aids to navigation along the Atlantic Coast from Shark River, New Jersey to the North Carolina-South Carolina border. In 2019 Maple assisted NASA in testing the Crew Module Uprighting System of the Orion spacecraft, which is planned to land on water.

The concept is particularly useful in cases in which the amount of fluid transported is linearly related to whatever is driving the transport. For example, the concept is useful in the flow of liquids through permeable media, especially in hydrology in relation to river and lake bottoms. In this case, it is an application of intrinsic permeability to a unit of material with a defined area and thickness, and the magnitude of conductance affects the rate of groundwater recharge or interaction with groundwater. This parameter is often used in such computer modelling codes as MODFLOW. Conductance is also a useful concept in the design and study of vacuum systems. Such systems consist of vacuum chambers and the various flow passages and pumps that connect and maintain them. These systems are common in physical science laboratories and many laboratory apparatus as well, such as mass spectrometers. Typically, the pressures inside these devices are low enough that the gas inside them is rarefied, meaning here that the mean free path of constituent atoms and molecules is a non-negligible fraction of the dimensions of orifices and passageways. Under those conditions, the total mass flow through an orifice or conduit is typically linearly proportional to the pressure drop, so that it is convenient to quantify mass flow in terms of the fluid conductance of the constituent components. Example from hydrology For example, the conductance of water through a stream-bed is: :C_b = K \\\\frac{A}{b} where :C_b is the conductance of the stream-bed ([L2T‚àí1]; m2s‚àí1 or ft2day‚àí1) :K is the hydraulic conductivity of the stream-bed materials([LT‚àí1]; m¬∑s‚àí1 or ft¬∑day‚àí1]; :A is the area of the stream-bed ([L2]; m2 or ft2) :b is the thickness of the stream-bed sediments ([L]; m or ft) The volumetric discharge through the stream-bed can be calculated if the difference in hydraulic head is known: :Q_b = C_b (h_b - h)\\\\, where :Q_b is the volumetric discharge through the stream-bed ([L3T‚àí1]; m3s‚àí1 or ft3day‚àí1) :h_b is the hydraulic head of the river (elevation stage) :h is the hydraulic head of the aquifer below the stream-bed ([L]; m or ft) Example from vacuum technology The defining equation for conductance in vacuum technology is :Q = (P_1-P_2)C. Here :Q is the total throughput, usually by convention not measured as a mass throughput but rather as a pressure throughput and having units of pressure times volume per second, :P_1 and P_2 are the upstream and downstream pressures, :C is the conductance, having units of volume/time, which are the same units as pumping speed for a vacuum pump. This definition proves useful in vacuum systems because under conditions of rarefied gas flow, the conductance of various structures is usually constant, and the overall conductance of a complex network of pipes, orifices and other conveyances can be found in direct analogy to a resistive electrical circuit. For example, the conductance of a simple orifice is :C = 15 d^2 liters/sec, where d is measured in centimeters. Hydrology ","title":"Fluid conductance"},{"id":"6363867","text":"David W.

Contributions  Galenson is known for postulating a new theory of artistic creativity. Based on a study of the ages at which various innovative artists made their greatest contributions to the field, Galenson's theory divides all artists into two classes: conceptualists, who make radical innovations in their field at a very early age; and experimentalists, whose innovations develop slowly over a long period of experimentation and refinement. Although Galenson initially developed his theory from data solely concerning the visual arts, he has since also investigated conceptual and experimental innovators among poets, novelists, film makers, popular musicians and economists.Pink, Daniel H. \\"What Kind of Genius are You?\\" Wired . 148-53,166. Among the examples Galenson cites of conceptualists are: *F. Scott Fitzgerald, who wrote The Great Gatsby at 29. *Pablo Picasso, who painted Les Demoiselles d'Avignon at 26. *Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane at 26. Among the examples he gives of experimentalists are: *Mark Twain, who wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn at 50. *Alfred Hitchcock, who made Vertigo at 59.Pink, Daniel H. \\"What Kind of Genius are You?\\" Wired . 152-53. In 2008, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in fine arts research. Comics theorist Scott McCloud seems to have anticipated some aspects of Galenson's theory in his 1993 book Understanding Comics.  Criticisms  Galenson's distinction between conceptual and experimental is based upon evidence from the age in which artists were most productive creatively. However, other studies have challenged that the underlying cause is not age, but are due to artistic movements which occur in certain periods. Artists in artistic movements tend to be creative regardless of their age. Thus, Galenson's theory has been criticized for overemphasizing the individual and overlooking the collective aspects in supporting creativity.

Born in the United States, he later became a naturalized Japanese citizen. Merrell lived and worked mainly in Shiga Prefecture in Japan. With only limited formal training as an architect, he founded an architectural office in Shiga which employed over thirty professional staff and was responsible for the design of well over 1000 residential, commercial, and church structures in Japan and occupied Korea, prior to the Second World War. Biography Vories was born in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1880. He graduated from Colorado College in 1904. At first he hoped to be an architect, although he came to Japan in 1905 as an English-language teacher, with an intention to engage in Christian missionary work. While working as a teacher in Omihachiman, Shiga Prefecture, in 1908 he was dismissed from teaching job because his Bible Classes had attracted over one third of his class among others who were aligned with local Buddhist temples. Vories had been asked to inspect the construction of an Omihachiman YMCA office building in 1907, A picture is archived at the William Merrell Vories Library titled \\"Former Hachiman YMCA designed and built by Mr. Vories Feb. 10, 1907\\", financed by his savings and donations from his friends in America.\\" which became his first work as an architect in Japan. He opened his office for architectural design in 1908 and in the following year, he founded \\"Vories & Co.\\" along with Lester Chapin, an architect, and Etsuz≈ç Yoshida, his English class student. They held it initially in Kyoto and moved to ≈åmihachiman to accommodate for their success.\\"Vories & Co.\\" established in 1909 later called \\"W.M.Vories & Company Architects Ichiryusha\\" since 1961 as succeeding Vories and his friends' work. Through YMCA activities in Japan, Vories became acquainted with many American and Japanese people, and received numerous commissions to design houses, churches, schools, hospitals, and YMCA facilities near and far. As many as 1,600 buildings can be credited to Vories' designs. In 1918, he founded the Omi Mission, and devoted his efforts to Christian missionary work and education. In 1919, Vories married the daughter of viscount Suenori Hitotsuyanagi, . He established Omi Sales Company in 1920, to promote an ointment called Mentholatum to earn funds to support his missionary work. In 1934, the Omi Mission was renamed to . Vories also loved music, and is credited with introducing the Hammond Organ into Japan. The collective of schools which were founded by the Omi Brotherhood, known as Vories Gakuen, maintain usage of the Hammond organs supplied by Vories. In 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Vories was naturalized as a Japanese citizen and took the name of Mereru Hitotsuyanagi as required by the Japanese law, pledged his allegiance to the nation of Japan and to the Emperor Hirohito.Colorado College Tutt Library: Special Collections In September 1945, the former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe asked Vories to convey a message to SCAP on the Emperor's behalf. Vories also shared the idea of the Emperor renouncing claims of divinity and declaring his humanity. He would later went on to meet the Emperor four times. Death In 1957, Vories suffered a stroke while he was in his summer home in Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture and was transported back to ≈åmihachiman for medical treatment. He remained bedridden for seven years and died on the second floor of his house on May 7, 1964, at the age of 83. In 1958, Vories was awarded as the first Honorary Citizen of Omihachiman. He was posthumously honored the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class, by the Japanese government.

The group chose twenty victims but succeeded in killing only two: former Finance Minister and head of the Rikken Minseit≈ç political party, Junnosuke Inoue, and the Director-General of Mitsui Holding Company, Dan Takuma. The arrest of the assassins led to the discovery of the existence of a civilian ultranationalist group led by self-styled Buddhist preacher, Nissh≈ç Inoue. Background Born as Inoue Shir≈ç in 1886 in Gunma Prefecture, Nissh≈ç spent his young adult life as a drifter and adventurer, eventually ending up in north and northeast China gathering information for the Japanese military. After a series of mystical experiences in 1923‚Äì24, Inoue became convinced that Japan required spiritual rebirth and that he was called to be its savior. He established a school in Ibaraki Prefecture to promote agrarianism and social reform, which gradually evolved into a training center for ultra-rightist radicals. He adopted the name Nissh≈ç (\\"Called by The Sun\\") along with ideas and symbols derived from Nichiren Buddhism. After the October incident, a failed coup d'√©tat by rightist Army officers of the Sakurakai ultranationalist secret society in 1931, Inoue became convinced that national reform could be achieved only through violent confrontation with what he saw as the forces of evil: pro-Western liberal politicians and zaibatsu business interests. He devised the slogan \\"ichinin issatsu\\" (\\"one person, one kill\\") and drew up a list of twenty politicians and business leaders whose assassination would be the first step toward restoring supreme political power to the Emperor, a platform known as the \\"Sh≈çwa Restoration\\". Inoue's original group made contact with a group of extremist officers in the Imperial Japanese Navy, who strongly objected to Japan's acceptance of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, and a group of right-wing university students from Tokyo. Inoue distributed Browning automatic pistols to his followers; however, only two actually carried out their missions. Assassinations On 9 February 1932, Sh≈ç Onuma gunned down Junnosuke Inoue as he stepped from his car at the Komamoto Elementary School in Tokyo, where he was scheduled to give a political speech. On 5 March 1932, Gor≈ç Hishinuma waited outside the entrance to Mitsui Bank in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, with a picture of Takuma Dan in his pocket. When Dan arrived, he shot him dead on the spot. Both killers were apprehended immediately. On 11 March 1932, Inoue turned himself in at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, where he was apparently treated with respect as a \\"patriot\\". Two months later, in the May 15 Incident, of 1932, Japanese naval officers, including some associated with the League of Blood, assassinated Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. Aftermath The phrase \\"League of Blood\\" is actually something of a misnomer. It referred to an oath of loyalty taken by a handful of the conspirators, but there is no evidence that it was a \\"blood oath\\" in any technical sense. The term , however, appeared in the popular press during the group's trial and was adopted by the lead prosecutor. Historically, the most important consequences of the League of Blood Incident sprang from the trial, which gave Inoue and his co-defendants a platform from which to broadcast their ultra-nationalist views. Many in the Japanese public came to sympathize with the aims of the conspirators, if not their methods. Following the trial it became harder for courts to deal harshly with terrorists who claimed to be acting in the interests of the Emperor. In a more general sense the trial and its aftermath contributed to the erosion of the rule of law in 1930s Japan. Sentenced to life imprisonment in 1934, Inoue was released under a general amnesty in 1940, and died in 1967. This incident inspired the central plot of Yukio Mishima's novel Runaway Horses.

It was created and produced by Kevin Sullivan, best known for his adaptation of Anne of Green Gables and Road to Avonlea. The series had five seasons, each with 13 episodes, and a Christmas-themed movie produced to wrap up loose ends, following the unexpected cancellation of the series. In the United States, Wind at My Back first aired on Encore WAM! and then on the Odyssey Network (which later became the Hallmark Channel). Its last airing on Hallmark was in 2001. At the beginning of 2010, the series was picked up by BYU Television as part of its Friday night lineup, and later expanded to weekdays to air at 11 am, 5 pm, and 6 am ET. Later that same year, the series was picked up by PTL Satellite Network-rebranded The Inspiration Network to air weekdays at 2 pm, 7 pm, and 12 am. Season one started airing on the Inspiration Network in the summer of 2011 at 7:00 pm ET. The series is set during the Great Depression of the 1930s, in the fictional small mining town of New Bedford in Northern Ontario. The family drama followed the members of the Bailey family as they lived through a time marked by hardship. Wind at My Back was loosely based on the Max Braithwaite books Never Sleep Three in a Bed and The Night We Stole the Mountie's Car. Plot The series opens in 1932, as Jack and Honey Bailey lose their hardware store and are forced to move back to Jack's hometown in Northern Ontario, where his family owns a silver mine. When Jack dies after being stung by hornets, Honey is forced to leave her children with her domineering mother-in-law while she searches for work. The series follows Honey, her children, their extended family, and friends as they attempt to survive and thrive during the 1930s. Characters=Honey Bailey When the show begins, Roman Catholic Honey (Cynthia Belliveau in seasons 1-3, and Laura Bruneau, seasons 4-5) is married to Presbyterian Jack Bailey. They own a small town hardware store, but it is forced into bankruptcy when the bank calls their loan. They return to Jack's mother's home, revealing Jack is from a privileged upbringing. Jack finds the visit intolerable with his overbearing mother, May, and retreats with his family to their summer cabin by the lake. Upon cleaning the house out, Jack encounters a nest of hornets that quickly overtake him. Honey and the children try to get him back to town, but he succumbs to the stings and dies soon after. While at May's house, Honey desperately tries to find work to no avail. May also forces Honey to give up her baby daughter, Violet, to the care of distant relatives, telling her that the judge would find her unfit should she try to fight it. Honey never fully understood the arrangement May had offered the relatives regarding Violet, that she was up for a full adoption. Not finding work in New Bedford, Honey decides she must leave the boys with May while she looks for work elsewhere. She lives with her brother in North Bridge for a while. She got a job, but her brother sold the building the apartment was in, stole her money, and left town without telling her. She then worked in a garment factory in Toronto, but lost it following a near-death illness. To recuperate, she reluctantly went back to May's. She is given an office0 job at the mine, May's mine, and soon creates a following in the town as a hairdresser. She makes friends in the small town, one of whom lives in the house, Grace, May's adult daughter. Grace is also a savior to the boys on many occasions. Honey and the boys suffered months of May's manipulations, including the near-kidnap of her daughter, Violet, to Florida. Honey takes her children to live in the back room of the local laundromat. She loses her job at the mine, but gains a very part-time one in the laundromat. She also loses all of her hairdressing clients. Max Sutton, a man of whom she had grown quite fond, asks her to marry him, to which she agrees. He then takes a teaching job in Albany, NY. May is beyond distressed that Honey would take her grandsons away. She tries first to manipulate the school board into letting Max keep his job, but after they had fired him for her, they refused. She then goes to her son to try to convince him to give Honey her job back at the mine. This also does not work. Her last resort is to try to make a gift of the house Honey had been saving to buy, but May had purchased it out from under her so she could not have it and Honey declined the gift. At the last minute, Max receives a job offer that could keep them in New Bedford, something Honey's second son, Henry, or Fat, really wants to do. His youth and naivete allowed him to often see the good of May's heart and he openly explained he did not want to leave because he knew it would hurt her if they did. Honey and Max Sutton marry. They live in the local hotel in a suite of small but comfortable rooms. Hub's bad behaviors seem to be level out and things quieten for the family. Shortly after their marriage, Honey discovers she is pregnant, giving birth to Zach. Her joy quickly evaporates, though, when she is diagnosed with tuberculosis. She leaves for a sanatorium to recover and Max is forced to raise the four children. When she returns one year later, Honey finds that the children have grown and changed and that everyone in town is scared of her due to her illness. Slowly, she recovers her hair salon and tries to begin her life again. Soon, her life is back to normal. May Bailey May (Shirley Douglas) is Honey's domineering mother-in-law. She and her late husband are the founders of the town. They ran a mining operation that continued to keep the family going. May's money and prestige allow her to have whatever she wants. She uses her pride, her sense of family, and her religion to justify most of her highly manipulative actions. She is often right, but all of the conclusions could have been reached in far less intrusive ways. She never lets people reach their own conclusions. Due to her deeply held Protestant ways, she is completely intolerant and unaccepting of Honey's Catholicism and any effects on the boys, something about which she is not quiet. Through conversations with Grace, her daughter, she is also revealed to still resent Honey for taking her son away from the family mining business. This does seem unknown to Honey. Very soon after Jack's death, she forces Honey to give up her small daughter, Violet, and keeps her from getting a job in the town, knowing this would force Honey to leave to look for work elsewhere. May views the boys as a second chance, an opportunity to fix the mistakes she made with her own sons. While her decisions are often harsh and manipulative, May honestly believes that her decisions are what is best for the family. May can be a confusing mix of qualities. She is frequently self-serving and manipulative, but she can show moments of true gentleness, kindness, and understanding. These moments are few, but they do allow some insight into who she really is. She also allows snippets of explanation out when she talks to the boys. In one of her responses to a request from the boys, she reveals what has happened in her life to bring her to where she is now. They are flabbergasted their grandmother has survived so much and seem to show a bit of new-found respect, more so with Henry, the younger son. Hub tends to remain defiant and cynical. It becomes apparent that she has a serious heart condition and suffers a number of severe heart attacks. She attempted to hide her condition from the family, but it is discovered after the attacks become more severe. May is frustrated by her family's attempts to care for her and insists they are only interested in taking over the mine. She resists the advice of the doctor, her private nurse. and family whenever possible so she can attempt to control the mine. Eventually, she fires the nurse and regains her position as head of the mine. Her relationship remains rocky with Honey until Honey gives birth to Zach, in the mining office. May delivers the baby and decides to put her differences with Honey aside. Later, May suffers a stroke that leaves her partially paralyzed on one side. With the support of her family and a new nurse, she slowly recovers. She still maintains her position as head of the mine. May recovers from her stroke very well, traveling to Europe within about 18 months of the stroke. She and Grace are recovering the body of Grace's deceased husband, who was killed fighting in Spain. This is mentioned in the Christmas special. Grace Bailey Grace (Kathy Greenwood) is Honey's unmarried adult sister-in-law who lives under the same roof with her domineering mother. Grace is a gentle, loving, happy, and playful soul who can appear naive or at least inexperienced at times. Grace has never left home because her mother destroys her self-confidence at every turn and frequently states Grace \\"could never make it for five minutes on her own\\". While Grace mostly obeys her mother, when she strongly believes in something, she will stand up for herself or the issue. But to experience many of the normal things in life and without experiencing the wrath of her disapproving mother, she has found that doing things without May knowing is the path of least resistance. When the boys move into their grandmother's home, Grace teaches them secrets of how to survive in the household. In return, one of the skills she learned from the boys and Honey was how to dismiss May and to simply state how things are to her face without feeling completely crushed by her. Grace was once so delicate, May barely had to say anything at all and she would have an anxiety attack. She gained more confidence, though, in speaking the truth to May. Both Grace and Honey never use harsh language with May, unlike Hub, who really could not care less if May knows the truth of his feelings. These outbursts leave room for Grace to explain to her mother where she has gone wrong and that if she keeps it up she \\"won't be there to hold her hand.\\" After seeing Honey's little family fight May so hard to stay together, Grace finds her courage and decides it is time for her to move out. She begins a job as a telephone operator and then a job as the local radio station supervisor. She later moves away from home and shares a house with her former sister-in-law, Toppy. Grace is involved with a series of men, but nothing ever works out between them. Once, a \\"true love\\" was mentioned, but for reasons unknown, it never worked out. Grace eventually becomes involved with a man named Van and after a short whirlwind affair, she marries him. She quickly finds out that he is actually a con man and has lied to her about everything, except how he feels about her, something she no longer cares about. He tries to win her back and for a very short time it looks as if he has succeeded, but in due course, Van discovers she is trying to run a game on him. He does not reveal that he is onto her, letting it all play out as she wanted. This con was something that Toppy tried repeatedly to talk Grace from doing. Grace's ire was so hot it was nearly beyond her. She wanted him to feel something of what she had at his hand. In the wake of her disgust, Van joins the army and goes to fight in Spain. In the moments before he leaves, his real name is revealed as James. During the fighting, he is killed. Grace is sent and then accepts a request from her dead husband to retrieve his body from Europe and to bury him in San Francisco, where he is from. Her trip occurs during the Christmas special, so neither she nor May is seen. Over the course of the series, Grace Bailey had a number of beaux. In Season 1, Grace went out with Judd Wainwright, an old classmate who she runs into on the bus to North Bridge. Encouraged by Honey, Grace sneaks out to attend a friend's out-of-town wedding with Judd (\\"Aunt Grace's Wedding\\"). Judd proposes, but breaks off the engagement near the end of Season 1. In Season 2, Grace was romantically linked with Ollie Jefferson, an unsure mechanic who wanted to marry Grace, but Grace often did not feel the same. Grace found herself more drawn to Del Sutton, Max's older brother, who came to town for Honey and Max's wedding, but decided to stay in town and eventually got a job with Ollie at the Jefferson's Garage. Their fling lasted from the end of season two to the middle of season three, when Del loses his job and decides to leave town (\\"New Directions\\"). After Del leaves, Grace meets Jim Flett, the new schoolteacher who was widowed with a son. Their friendship grows and at the end of Season 4, they share a kiss. In Season 5, Jim decides he is not yet ready to move on from the loss of his wife, and Grace falls for Vanaver 'Van' Mainwairing, a mysterious stranger who arrives in town. They are married in a matter of days, but their marriage comes to a bitter end when Grace discovers that Van used her in a con and will not forgive him. He, heartbroken over his mistake, and leaves to fight in the Spanish Civil War. In the Christmas movie, it is revealed that Van died in the war. Hubert \\"Hub\\" Bailey Hubert (Dylan Provencher) is Honey's eldest son. In the first season, Hub is 12 years old. He is somewhat mischievous and tough. He is incredibly stubborn and frequently resists his grandmother's control over him. Soon after his arrival in New Bedford, Hub begins to get into trouble and fail in school. His problems are caused by his loss of his father, his far-away mother and younger sister, and his frustrations with his grandmother. Once his family is reunited and his life settles down, his problems fade. In the second season, he becomes interested in the mine. May encourages this interest and begins to prime him to become the future head of the mine. When he is older, he works in the mine and discovers the injustices in the miners' lives. May and he work together to create a plan to improve the miners' lives. As Hub moves into his later teens, he loses his tough side and becomes a quieter, gentler boy. He is frequently concerned with injustice and doing good. At one point, he even offers to marry a pregnant friend so that she and her baby will not be alone. After much contemplation, he decides that his career is not going to be running the mine. He wants to become a priest, which he feels will let him do good. May is outraged by the decision and disinherits him. They eventually settle their difference, but it is not clear if Hub is reinherited. During the Christmas special, Hub is attending seminary, but his attention is drawn away from his studies by a young Jewish girl, who escaped from Austria. His relationship with her eventually influences his decision to drop out of seminary and find another way to do good in the world. Henry \\"Fat\\" Bailey Henry (Tyrone Savage) is Honey's second son. He is about 10 when the series begins. He is kind hearted but very mischievous. To Hub's annoyance, Fat frequently tags along on his adventures. While Hub frequently resents his grandmother, Fat appears to like her. He often helps her and spends time with her. He frequently manages to be affectionate with her, something that none of the other family manages to achieve. In the second season, Fat makes friends with a tomboy named Maisey who works at her grandfather's pawn shop. While she frequently bosses him around, Fat enjoys her company as an alternative to Hub. When Hub gets older and spends less time with him, Fat relies more and more on Maisey for friendship. As Fat gets older, he finds himself getting into trouble frequently. He feels he is old enough not to be treated like a child and rebels against the authority around him. The local people, Hub, and even his parents do not take him very seriously, which leads to his frustration. Fat shows no interest in the mine over the years and May does not bother to try to interest him. Fat's main interest is in the police and the RCMP. Most of his interest in law enforcement is caused by movies and fictional stories until he meets a police officer, during the Christmas special. This interaction leads him to announce to the family that he intends to become a police officer. His family does not seriously listen to him but Fat appears to be set on this goal. Max Sutton Max (James Carroll) is a local school teacher in New Bedford who takes a liking to Honey. Max actually meets the boys first, when they have run away from home. After they get hurt in an accident, he helps them. He encourages them to join the school's sports teams, which Hub eventually does. He also drives them to visit Violet in another town. In the second season, Max and Honey are married. When Max marries Honey, Hub resents his addition to the family. Hub feels he is a weak replacement for their father and resists Max's attempts to control him or Fat. They eventually accept each other and Hub later sees Max as a support. May also has issues with Max, believing him to be a Communist and too laid back to be a school teacher. Eventually, they come to an understanding, after Max discovers a vein of ore on May's rural property. When Honey gives birth to Max's child, Zach, he is delighted. Max is a freelance writer, who frequently writes crime stories or pieces for the local radio station. In the Christmas special, Honey and he work together to try to find a way for him to complete his novel and allow Honey to go to college. Robert \\"Bob\\" and Toppy Bailey Bob (Dan Lett) is May's oldest son. He runs the mine, but is frequently frustrated by her attempts to control things. Toppy (Robin Craig) is Bob's wife and May's other daughter-in-law. Toppy is her nickname, but her real name is never revealed. Toppy was the name of her doll when she was a child, a doll she dearly loved. The couple has a daughter named Doris. When the show begins, Bob, Toppy, and Doris are snobbish and cold to Honey and her children. Doris picks a fight with Hub on his first day in New Bedford, which leads to him punching her. This sets Bob and Doris's opinion of Hub in stone. In the second season, Bob tries to save the mine from bankruptcy, but his long work hours put on strain on his marriage and make him irritable. Eventually, Toppy leaves him, taking Doris with her to Toronto. When Toppy offers a chance at reconciliation, Bob abandons the mine and flees town. The couple hopes that getting away from the mine and May will allow them a second chance. Their attempts to save their marriage fail and they eventually divorce. Doris is sent to boarding school while the couple deals with the legal side of things. Toppy returns to New Bedford and attempts to start a life without Bob there. She is occasionally given the cold shoulder by locals because she is divorced, which was unacceptable in the 1930s. Toppy recurs in the first three seasons and becomes a regular cast member in seasons 4-5. Bob is only seen on a few occasions after he leaves town. May is furious with him leaving and frequently blames him for the problems with the mine. Violet Bailey Violet (Victoria Collyer in the first few seasons and Natasha LaForce in later seasons) is Honey's third child and only daughter. She is about 18 months old when the series begins. Honey is forced to give Violet to distant relatives, after her husband's death. The relatives are infertile and desperate for a child. May secretly tells them that Honey will never be able to get Violet back and they should raise Violet as if she were their own. They do this until Honey tries to get Violet back. When they believe they might lose Violet, they attempt to flee to the United States. Hub and Fat kidnap Violet back and return her to Honey. After this event, Honey leaves May's home, with all three children, vowing never to come back. Violet grows slowly through the seasons after this. When she gets older, she seems to consider Max her father, although he is not; she has no recollection of or interest in her real father. She frequently plays with Fat, as she is eight years younger than he. Season synopses=Season 1 The first season is set in 1932‚Äì1933. In the town of North Bridge, the bank shuts down Jack and Honey Bailey's hardware store. Unable to find work, Jack realizes his only choice is to return to his hometown of New Bedford, where his domineering mother May Bailey runs the Silver Dome mine. After Jack dies of a severe allergic reaction after being stung by hornets, his mother May Bailey, who never approved of Jack's choice of a wife, forces Honey to leave her two sons, Hub and Fat, in New Bedford, and sends away her daughter, Violet, to relatives. While May's actions are manipulative and harsh, she truly believes she is doing what is best for her grandchildren. Hub (Hubert) and Fat (Henry) resent their grandmother for separating them from their family and scheme to return to their mother. After a series of devastating setbacks, Honey moves in with May and is reunited with her sons. Together, they dream of a future where they are reunited with Violet and are able to move away from May. Season 2 Season 2 is set in 1933‚Äì1934. Honey marries school teacher Max Sutton, moves into the New Bedford hotel, and opens a beauty parlor on Main Street. The Silver Dome Mine experiences financial problems, and a mining accident which kills and blinds some workers. The season ends as the mine is shut down, and Grace and Del Sutton (Max's immature bum of a brother) starting a very rocky romance. Season 3 Season 3 is set in 1934-1935. May Bailey is able to reopen the mine, but she changes operations to nickel instead of silver. Meanwhile, her daughter Grace continues her search for love after Del Sutton leaves town. Honey's son Hub comes of age, and falls in love with Alice MacFarlane, whose father was blinded by the mining accident. May's oldest son Bob becomes separated from his wife Toppy, who moves back to New Bedford. Meanwhile, Honey falls ill from influenza and pneumonia and must leave town for medical treatment. Season 4 Season 4 is set in 1935-1936. Max is struggling to support four children on his own while Honey is still away at a sanitorium. Grace grows closer to school teacher Jim Flett while exploring journalism, and eventually he kisses her in the last episode of the season. Hub is thrilled that Alice MacFarlane has returned to town but finds that she became pregnant while in Toronto. Fat develops a friendship with Jim's son Pritchard. In the process of a divorce, Toppy finds she is shunned by the other women in town. A recast Honey returns to town with a clean bill of health. Season 5 Season 5 is set in 1936. After Jim Flett decides he is not ready for a relationship, Grace meets a charming stranger from out of town who proposes to her. Hub thinks about joining the priesthood. Honey adjusts to living in New Bedford again, but finds that she wishes to further her education while Max considers running for mayor. The show was abruptly cancelled at the termination of the fifth season. Christmas movie Meant to tie up some of the loose ends left when the series was cancelled, A Wind at My Back Christmas takes place in December 1938. Hub is studying to become a priest, but starts to have second thoughts as he spends more and more time with music student Anna Schiller (Meredith Henderson). When he finds out her status as a Jewish refugee who escaped from Austria following the Nazi annexation, Hub takes her to New Bedford to keep her from being deported, but faces hostility from his mother, who wants him to become a priest, and his brother, who resents his success. The movie ends with Anna escaping to the United States and Hub deciding not to become a priest. Max and Honey arrange that they will both pursue their dreams. Honey will go to college and Max will finish his novel. Also, Henry announces his interest in joining the RCMP. The actors who play Grace Bailey, May Bailey, and Pritchard Flett are not in the movie. Their absence is explained through telegrams the family receives from Grace and Jim Flett. Apparently, Grace and May went to Spain to recover the body of Grace's husband, who was killed in the war. As they are returning home, May falls ill, and they are unable to return to Canada for the holidays, while Pritchard, though, went to live with his grandparents in Niagara Falls. Home media Sullivan Entertainment released all five seasons and the Christmas special on DVD in Region 1. In 2016, Sullivan Entertainment announced it would launch their own streaming service called Gazebo TV that would feature the Wind at My Back series among other titles produced by the company. The service launched in early 2017. Filming locations The show was filmed in the town of Bowmanville, one hour east of Toronto. It was filmed in the Bowmanville Museum and also in the Tyrone Mills also near Bowmanville. Also filmed in Tottenham Ontario. After the first season, Sullivan Entertainment built the town's exterior set on the backlot of their studio. Most of the series was filmed at the Sullivan Studio and Backlot in Toronto. Bass Lake Cottage was filmed on Brookdale Pond in Uxbridge, Ontario. Some episodes were also filmed in Jacksons Point, Ontario. Trivia The show was a favourite of Rush drummer Neil Peart, who talks of watching the show in his book, Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road. He described it as being like a Canadian version of The Waltons.

The Trail of Cthulhu is a series of interconnected short stories by American writer August Derleth as part of the Cthulhu Mythos genre of horror fiction. The stories chronicle the struggles of Laban Shrewsbury and his companions against the Great Old Ones, particularly Cthulhu. The stories were originally published in Weird Tales from 1944 to 1952, and were republished in collected form as The Trail of Cthulhu by Arkham House in 1962 in an edition of 2,470 copies.

Although he was born in Wisconsin, Shrewsbury spent most of his life in Arkham, Massachusetts. After publishing his first book, the controversial Investigation into the Myth-Patterns of the Latter-Day Primitives with Especial Reference to the R'lyeh Text, in 1915, Shrewsbury mysteriously disappeared. Shortly thereafter, a posthumous collection of his writings, titled Cthulhu Among the Victorians, saw publication. Just as mysteriously, Shrewsbury reappeared 20 years later and immediately began work on his next book, Cthulhu in the Necronomicon. Before he could complete this work, however, his home in Arkham was destroyed by an inexplicable fire in 1938. Shrewsbury was presumed dead and his unfinished volume was published as a posthumous work. Shrewsbury had actually escaped to Celaeno, fleeing certain Mythos horrors. Shrewsbury's manuscript, the Celaeno Fragments, remains under lock and key at Miskatonic's library. Shrewsbury also appears in Phillip O. Marsh's 1994 novel The Worm Shall Ye Fight!. Asked if Shrewsbury was a model for his character Titus Crow, Mythos author Brian Lumley replied: \\"No, for I was never too keen on him.

The character has been adapted to alternative media several times, including in the 1925 film adaptation starring Lon Chaney, the 1943 remake starring Claude Rains and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 musical. Character history In the original novel, few details are given regarding Erik's past. The novel confirms that Erik has traveled to multiple countries including France, Russia, Persia, and northern Vietnam, learning various arts and sciences from each region. Erik himself laments the fact that his mother was horrified by his birth deformity, and that his father, a true master mason, never saw him. Most of the character's history is revealed by a mysterious figure, known through most of the novel as The Persian or the Daroga, who saved Erik's life in Persia, and followed Erik to Paris; other details are discussed in the novel's epilogue (e.g., his birthplace is given as a small town outside of Rouen, France).  Phantom  Many different versions of Erik's life are told through other adaptations such as films, television shows, books, and musicals. One such popular literary adaptation is the Susan Kay novel Phantom (1990), a fictional in-depth story of Erik from the time of his birth to the end of his life at the Paris Opera House. For the most part, Kay's novel stays in context with Erik's life history as laid down by Leroux. However, Kay (as explained in her Author's Note) changes and shapes the character to match her own vision, influenced by other adaptations besides the original. In addition, the ending/resolution is quite different from Leroux's. The story follows Erik through his entire life, starting with the night of his birth, and is told from different viewpoints throughout the novel (Erik's mother, Erik, Nadir/the Persian, Christine, and Raoul). Kay places the highest priority on portraying romantic aspects of Erik's life.  Yeston and Kopit  The theatrical songwriting team of Maury Yeston and Arthur Kopit created a musical based on the novel, which investors backed out of after Webber's version became a huge hit. In this version, Erik has spent his entire life living beneath the Opera. Over the years, he became possessive of the Opera, and the creative driving force for the company. No artistic decision is made without Gerard Carriere seeking his approval. He offers to teach Christine Daa√© to sing after hearing her working in the costume shop, and falls in love with her. This storyline was also the basis for the 1990 miniseries starring Charles Dance, Teri Polo, and Burt Lancaster as Carriere. The Canary Trainer In Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel The Canary Trainer, Sherlock Holmes develops several theories as to the Phantom's identity. His first idea is that he is an employee of the Opera; however, when the Phantom's knowledge of the Opera becomes evident, Holmes then believes that he is Charles Garnier, having faked his own death. When Garnier's corpse is identified, Holmes then theorizes that the Phantom was Edouard LaFosse, the (fictional) assistant of Garnier who designed much of the Opera's interior and who allegedly died after a building collapse. Holmes theorizes that he did not die, but was merely disfigured and therefore took to hiding in the Opera. However, when Holmes finally confronts the Phantom, he claims that he cannot speak without his mask, as his mother forced him to wear it whenever he wished to speak as a child, and he is not Edouard LaFosse. Holmes therefore admits that he is not sure how true any of the theories or claims of the Phantom's identity are. The Phantom never provides a given name in the novel; he only tells Christine that his name is \\"Nobody.‚Äù Regardless of his identity, the Phantom in The Canary Trainer is much more unhinged and bloodthirsty than in the original novel or play. For example, when killing Madame Giry's replacement with the chandelier, he kills \\"almost thirty men and women in the twinkling of an eye\\", just to ensure that he kills his main target. He is also more psychologically disturbed, to the extent that when he tells Holmes that he has been 'taught' not to speak without his mask, he is revealed to only be capable of communicating in snarls and other animalistic sounds when Holmes knocks the mask off in their final confrontation. The Angel of the Opera In Sam Siciliano's novel The Angel of the Opera, Sherlock Holmes is brought in to solve the case of the Opera Ghost, and both Erik's and Holmes's stories unfold through the eyes of Holmes's assistant, Henri Vernier. Siciliano places Holmes and Vernier at several of the crucial scenes in Erik and Christine's relationship, and draws parallels between Erik and Holmes. Holmes sympathizes with Erik so much that after Christine leaves him, Holmes brings him back to England. One of the first people that Erik meets on his arrival is a blind girl with a fondness for music. Erik's deformity In the original novel, Erik is described as corpse-like and is referred to as having a \\"death's-head\\" (human skull) throughout the story. He has no nose; eyes that are sunken so deep that all is seen are two skull-like eye sockets except when his golden eyes glow in the dark; skin that is yellow and tightly stretched across his bones; and only a few wisps of dark brown hair behind his ears and on his forehead. (His mouth is never described in as much detail, but is referred to as a 'lipless' 'dead mouth' by Christine, and Erik acknowledges that his mouth is abnormal when lifting up his mask to display ventriloquism.) He is described as extremely thin, so much so that he resembles a skeleton. Christine graphically describes his cold, bony hands, which also either feel or smell like death (there is debate among both English and French speakers as to whether the original French word used here, \\"sentir,\\" was intended by Leroux to mean \\"smells like\\" or \\"feels like,\\" as the French word is used for both feel and smell depending on the context). Erik woefully describes himself to Christine as a corpse who is \\"built up with death from head to foot.\\" According to the Persian, Erik was born with this deformity and was exhibited as le mort vivant in freak shows earlier in his life. Erik sometimes plays up his macabre appearance, such as sleeping in a coffin and dressing up as the Red Death for the masked ball. Lon Chaney's characterization of Erik in the silent film The Phantom of the Opera (1925) remains closest to the book in content, in that Erik's face resembles a skull with an elongated nose slit and protruding, crooked teeth. In this version, Erik is said to have been deformed from birth. Chaney was a masterful make-up artist and was considered avant-garde for creating and applying Erik's facial make-up design himself. It is said that he kept it secret until the first day of filming. The result was allegedly so frightening to the women of the time that theatres showing the movie were cautioned to keep smelling salts on hand. Several movies based on the novel vary the deformities. In Universal's 1943 adaptation, he is disfigured when the publisher's assistant throws etching acid in his face. In the musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise (1974), Winslow (the Phantom character) gets his head caught in a record-press, while the horror version starring Robert Englund has him selling his soul to Satan and having his face mutilated as a result. This version also has a gruesome variation on the mask, in which Erik is sewing flesh to his face. In Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical adaptation, only half of Erik's face is deformed (thus the famous half-mask often associated with Erik's appearance.) His show was originally planned to have a full mask and full facial disfigurement, but when the director, Harold Prince, realized that it would make expression onstage very difficult, they halved the mask. The logo featuring a full mask was publicized before the change. The deformity in the musical includes a gash on the right side of his partially balding head with exposed skull tissue, an elongated right nostril, a missing right eyebrow, swollen lips, different colored eyes, and a wrinkled, warped right cheek. It is covered by a white half mask and wig. In the 2004 film adaptation of the musical, Erik's makeup was made to look much less gruesome than previous adaptations of the story. Instead of a skull-like face, his disfigurement resembles that of a mildly malformed face, which he covers with the mask. Film critic Roger Ebert noted that Butler was more \\"conventionally handsome\\" than his predecessors \\"in a GQ kind of way\\". The 1998 film adaptation starring Julian Sands as Erik is notable in that the character is not deformed and has instead a classically handsome face. Performers Lon Chaney, Sr. as Erik, The Phantom, in Universal's 1925 silent film version of The Phantom of the Opera.

It consists of 332 volumes and covers the history of the Ming Dynasty from 1368 to 1644. It was written by a number of officials commissioned by the court of Qing Dynasty, with Zhang Tingyu as the lead editor. The compilation started in the era of the Shunzhi Emperor and was completed in 1739 in the era of the Qianlong Emperor, though most of the volumes were written in the era of the Kangxi Emperor. The sinologist Endymion Wilkinson writes that the Mingshi, the second longest of the Twenty-Four Histories, after the History of Song, is \\"generally reckoned to be one of the best of the Histories and one of the easiest to read.\\"  Background  After the Qing Dynasty had entered and hosted the Chinese Central Plain, in the second year of the Shunzhi Emperor, the Censor Zhao Jiding (Ë∂ôÁπºÈºé) was asked to compile the History of Ming. On May of the second year of the Shunzhi Emperor, the court of Qing Dynasty established the committee consisted of the Grand Secretary Feng Quan, Li Jiantai, Fan Wencheng, Gang Lin, and Qi Chongge as the presidents to operate the compilation of the History of Ming. In the same year, the presidents nominated the vice presidents and compilers, and also nominated seven Zhang Guans, ten transcribers of Manchu language, and thirty-six transcribers of Chinese language to lift the curtain on compiling the History of Ming. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The Veritable Records of Ming were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this.  Process = Stage 1  The official compiling of History of Ming started on May 2 in the second year of Shunzhi Emperor. At that time, which is the early years that the Qing first entered and hosted the Central Plain. With the obvious purpose of compiling the History of Ming, the Qing dynasty intended to declare the collapse of Ming, however, the court of Hongguang (founded by the Ming imperial clan) with capital of Nanjing was antagonistic to the Qing, and the compiling of History of Ming was the announcement of inexistence of Hongguang Court. On May 15, the Army of Qing broke through Nanjing, and the Hongguang regime was destroyed. Zhu Yujian, the clan relative of Ming founded a new court called Longwu at Fuzhou. Meanwhile, Li Zicheng, the leader of the peasant uprising army jointed with the Ming's governor He Tengjiao, and fought against the court of Qing. It was impossible to concentrate a large member of stuffs to compiling the History of Ming in the unstable political and embattled situation. The turbulent situation lasted until the 22nd year of Qing's Kangxi Emperor, the Kangxi Emperor conquered all opposing states and unified Mainland of China and Taiwan. In the stage 1, the court of Qing was busy on the conquest, so the compiling process basically had no progress.  Stage 2  After the Revolt of the Three Feudatories had calmed down, the court of Qing was able to concentrate manpower to compile the History of Ming formally. Thirty-five years passed since the court of Qing officially announced the compilation of the History of Ming. In the 17th year of Kangxi Emperor, Qing started drafting learned scholars from all of the country, and stage 2 of compiling got into its stride. In the 4th year of Qianlong Emperor (1739), the History of Ming was completed compiling of all it sections. It was the third time that the court of Qing organized staff to modify the manuscript of the History of Ming, and finalized its compiling.http://baike.baidu.com/view/94368.htm One of the main sources for the History of Ming was Ming Shilu (the Ming Veritable Records), i.e. the records of individual emperors' reigns, each of which was compiled soon after the respective emperor's death, based on the daily records accumulated during the reign. Contents The History of Ming follows a similar structure to previous standard histories: * Annals (Êú¨Á¥Ä) - volumes 1-24 * Treatises (Âøó) - volumes 25-99 * Tables (Ë°®) - volumes 100-112 * Biographies (ÂàóÂÇ≥) - volumes 113-332 Volumes 320-328 cover foreign states (Â§ñÂúã).

He played rugby with Newport from 1923, and was given various roles within the pack, though he played mainly second row and prop. In 1926, Phillips faced his first international opposition when he was part of the Newport team that played the touring MƒÅoris. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, a score which the MƒÅori captain, Wattie Barclay, believed his team was fortunate to achieve.Billot (1972), pg 74. In 1927, Phillips was given his first international call-up, when he was selected for the opening game of the 1927 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Bernard Turnbull, Phillips' debut was against England at Twickenham which Wales lost 9-11. Phillips played in all the matches of the 1927 Championship which saw poor Welsh results, with only a single win, over France.

It depicts the head and shoulders of a man lying on a beach, taken from a low angle. The iconic photograph has been described as \\"quintessentially Australian\\", a \\"sort of icon of the Australian way of life\\", and \\"arguably the most widely recognised of all Australian photographs.\\" Composition The first version of Sunbaker (notice the clasped hand). Max Dupain, 1937-1948. Silver gelatin print from 1937 negative. State Library of New South Wales. The photograph depicts the head and shoulders of a man lying flat on his stomach on the sand. His head, tilted to the left, is resting on one arm and his other arm is lying flat on the sand before him. The photograph is taken from a very low angle and head on, so nothing else of the subject can be seen. The sun appears to be almost directly overhead and casts much of the subject into deep shadow while reflecting off the beads of water on his arms and back. The subject takes up much of the upper half of the work, with the bottom half consisting of a bright, empty area of sand. The picture can be seen as \\"forming a single pyramidal form positioned against the horizon.\\" Dupain took the photograph in 1937 at Culburra Beach, a small town on the New South Wales South Coast. The man in the photograph is Harold Salvage (1905-1991), a British builder, who was part of a group of friends on a surfing trip. The first version of the Sunbaker image (with Harold's hands clasped) appeared only once, in a limited edition booklet entitled Max Dupain: photographs which was published by Hal Missingham in 1948. This was Dupain's preferred version, but unfortunately the original negative was lost. As a result, the prints that went on to become his most famous work were printed from a second negative which shows the sunbaker's hand relaxed. The most familiar version of the photograph was not printed until a retrospective of Dupain's work in 1975 at the Australian Centre for Photography, Sydney. The only known vintage print of the original version was donated to the State Library of New South Wales as one of over 108 vintage prints compiled by Dupain's friend, the architect Chris Vandyke, in the Vandyke Album. Reception and legacy The photograph has been described as \\"perhaps the most famous and admired photograph in Australia\\" and \\"probably the most widely recognised Australian photograph\\". The image has been regarded as inspired by European modernist photographers, with \\"more interest in abstract form than descriptive photographs.\\" The image has \\"become part of the consciousness of Australians ‚Äì symbolising health, vitality, a love of the outdoors and an appreciation of sport and relaxation.\\" Isobel Crombie, senior curator of photography at the National Gallery of Victoria, has argued that this work, and much of Dupain's work in the 1930s, shows sign of being influenced by the concepts of eugenics, vitalism, and the \\"body culture\\" movement. Crombie states that \\"most of us think of Dupain as a strict, clear modernist ... But there is a whole series of works ... heavily influenced by the ideas of the regeneration of a race through the revitalisation of the body.\\" Crombie considers Dupain's work of the period, including Sunbaker, to represent a \\"racial archetype\\" of ideal Australians.

The area undergoing this large-scale redevelopment includes the city's two major sports venues, the Honda Center and Angel Stadium of Anaheim.  Geography  The district's boundaries are roughly defined by Interstate 5, the Santa Ana River, and Cerritos Avenue. A small section to the south is part of the city of Orange, and thus is not considered part of the Platinum Triangle. The primary arterial roads through the area are State College Boulevard and Katella Avenue. The district is located east of the Anaheim Resort, a major tourist destination which encompasses the Disneyland Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, and several dozen hotels. It is also just north of The Block at Orange, a large outdoor shopping center, and UCI Medical Center. The Triangle also contains Angel Stadium of Anaheim and The Grove of Anaheim, a popular entertainment venue adjacent to the stadium. Honda Center, on the other side of State Route 57, is also within the Platinum Triangle.City of Anaheim - The Platinum Triangle. Anaheim.net. Retrieved on 2013-09-06. Zoning Plans Angels and Ducks When redevelopment is completed, the district is expected to offer mixed-use urban living with easy access to dining, shopping, and entertainment. It is envisioned as a downtown district for Orange County, competing with the South Coast Metro area, Irvine Business Complex, and downtown Santa Ana. The current tenants of the area, mainly industrial buildings, are gradually relocating to make way for mid-rise apartments, retail space, and several high-rise commercial buildings. In 2008, Anaheim city planners announced an expansion of the initial Platinum Triangle proposal, doubling the amount of housing units and commercial office space from the original plans. Currently, 16 projects are either planned or currently under construction for a total of 18,363 homes, of commercial space and of office space. , three projects had been completed: the Stadium Lofts, 1818 Platinum Triangle, and Gateway apartment homes. Additionally, construction has begun on several new roads west of Angel Stadium, including Market Street, the central promenade for the district.  Transportation  City planners envision the triangle as a transit-oriented environment, encompassing the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, or ARTIC, which replaced the Anaheim Amtrak Station located in the Angel Stadium parking lot. ARTIC continues to serve Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner and Metrolink trains, and will also be a terminus for the planned California High-Speed Rail system. Additionally, ARTIC would be a transfer point to a planned rapid transit line which would run from ARTIC to the Disneyland Resort. ARTIC is also be a main transfer point to Orange County Transportation Authority bus routes. Planners hope that the robust transportation infrastructure will prevent a severe increase in traffic congestion from the large number of new residents and commuters.

In Virginia, the U.S. Highway runs from the North Carolina state line near Skippers north to the Maryland state line at the Potomac River near Dahlgren. US 301 forms the local complement to Interstate 95 (I-95) from Emporia to Petersburg. The U.S. Highway runs concurrently with US 1 between Petersburg and the state capital of Richmond, where the highways form one of the main north-south avenues. US 301 continues north concurrent with Virginia State Route 2 (SR 2) to Bowling Green, forming an eastern alternative to I-95 and US 1 north of Richmond. At Bowling Green, which is connected to I-95 by SR 207, US 301 becomes the primary highway connecting Richmond and the Northern Neck with Southern Maryland. US 301 was constructed in four main segments: as the original SR 24 and then US 17-1 south of Petersburg, as US 1 from Petersburg to Richmond, as SR 2 from Richmond to Bowling Green, and as part of SR 207 toward Dahlgren. US 301 replaced US 17-1 in the early 1930s and was extended from Petersburg north along its current course into Maryland when the Potomac River Bridge was completed in 1940. Route description=North Carolina to Petersburg US 301 enters Greensville County, Virginia from North Carolina as two-lane Skippers Road, which closely parallels CSX's North End Subdivision rail line, crosses Fontaine Creek, and passes through the hamlet of Skippers. The U.S. Highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its trumpet interchange with I-95 before becoming two lanes again as it enters the independent city of Emporia as Main Street. US 301 passes through downtown Emporia, crosses the Meherrin River, passing three Virginia Historical Markers in one block facing northbound traffic between Virginia Avenue and Valley Street, and has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's Franklin District immediately to the south of its intersection with US 58 Business (Atlantic Street). The U.S. Highway expands to a four-lane undivided highway and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 58 before re-entering Greensville County as four-lane divided Sussex Drive. Northbound US 301 receives a ramp from northbound I-95 a short distance south of I-95's diamond interchange with SR 614 (Otterdam Road) just west of the US 301-SR 614 intersection. US 301 entering from North Carolina US 301 crosses over to the east side of the CSX rail line and enters Sussex County, where the highway's name changes to Blue Star Highway. The U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with I-95 where the Interstate crosses to the east side of the highway. US 301 meets the eastern end of SR 139 (Jarratt Avenue) while passing through the town of Jarratt. North of Jarratt, the U.S. Highway reduces to two lanes and begins to closely parallel the southbound lanes of I-95, with temporary diversions from the Interstate where secondary highways cross or have interchanges with the Interstate. The I-95 southbound lanes in this section were originally built as the northbound US 301 lanes, with the original southbound lanes being restriped for two-way traffic after the construction of I-95. US 301 crosses the Nottoway River before reaching Stony Creek, where the namesake creek enters the Nottoway River. At Stony Creek, the U.S. Highway has a junction with SR 40 (Sussex Drive) and a short concurrency with SR 40 Business, which turns west to pass through the town as Lee Avenue. South of Carson, US 301 enters Prince George County and its name changes to Crater Road. The U.S. Highway continues to closely parallel I-95 to Templeton, where the highway has a short concurrency with SR 35 (Courtland Road), during which the highways cross to the east side of I-95 and have an interchange with the Interstate. US 301 turns north from SR 35 at the same intersection that receives a ramp from northbound I-95 and serves as the southern terminus of SR 156. US 301 and SR 156 have a short concurrency before SR 156 leaves as Prince George Drive toward Hopewell. The U.S. Highway crosses Warwick Swamp and has another interchange with I-95 in Kingwood, swapping to the west side of the Interstate. US 301 enters the city of Petersburg and expands to a four-lane divided highway just south of Wagner Road. The U.S. Highway crosses over Norfolk Southern's Norfolk District rail line in the Walnut Hill neighborhood of Petersburg, where the highway meets the southern end of US 301 Alternate (Sycamore Street). US 301 has another interchange with I-95 between I-95's junctions with I-85 and US 460, which runs concurrently with I-85 and I-95 through Petersburg. US 301 becomes concurrent with US 460 Business at the interchange that is next to the site of the Battle of the Crater. East of Old Towne Petersburg, US 301 has intersections with Wythe Street and Washington Street, which form an east-west one-way pair that US 460 Business follows through the downtown area. Wythe Street also carries eastbound SR 36; westbound SR 36 follows Washington Street to Crater Road, where US 301 and westbound SR 36 begin to run concurrently. US 301 has its own east-west one- way pair through Old Towne Petersburg: southbound US 301 follows Bank Street and northbound US 301 follows Bollingbrook Street with westbound SR 36. The one-way pair continues west to 2nd Street, where US 301 receives the northern end of its alternate route, SR 36 continues west along Bollingbrook Street, and US 301 joins US 1 on 2nd Street to leave Petersburg by crossing the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Bridge over the Appomattox River. Petersburg to Richmond Hanover Tavern as viewed from the green in front of the Hanover County Courthouse US 301 and US 1 pass through the city of Colonial Heights as Boulevard, a five-lane road with center turn lane. The U.S. Highways are joined by SR 144 (Temple Avenue) south of the highways' crossing of CSX's North End Subdivision. The three highways cross Swift Creek into Chesterfield County, where SR 144 splits northwest as Harrowgate Road and the U.S. Highways continue along four-lane undivided Jefferson Davis Highway.

The highway expands to six lanes just north of its crossing of Falling Creek near the site of the Falling Creek Ironworks and Ampthill plantation and just south of its cloverleaf interchange with SR 150 (Chippenham Parkway). US 301 and US 1 pass through the community of Bensley before entering the city of Richmond near Walmsley Boulevard. The U.S. Highways intersect SR 161 (Bells Road), which leads to the Port of Richmond on the James River. North of the Model Tobacco Building complex, US 301 and US 1 enter the Manchester section of Richmond. The highway's name changes to Cowardin Avenue at its intersection with US 360 (Hull Street). North of US 60 (Semmes Avenue), US 301 and US 1 have a partial interchange with Riverside Drive, allowing access to and from the north, and cross the James River and Belle Isle on the Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge. The bridge crosses over CSX's Rivanna Subdivision before reaching a partial interchange with 2nd Street, allowing access to and from the south, at its northern end, west of the Tredegar Iron Works. US 301 and US 1 follow Belvidere Street through the Oregon Hill neighborhood of Richmond, which lies to the east of Hollywood Cemetery, site of the James Monroe Tomb. US 301 entering from Maryland After crossing SR 195 (Downtown Expressway), which is indirectly accessed via Byrd Street and Cumberland Street, US 301 and US 1 pass between the eastern edge of the Virginia Commonwealth University campus and the western edge of Downtown Richmond. There, the U.S. Highways intersect SR 147, which follows Cary Street eastbound and Main Street westbound. US 301 and US 1 curve northeast between Monroe Park and The Commonwealth Club and intersect US 250 (Broad Street). North of its interchange with I-64 and I-95, the U.S. Highways curve north, cross CSX's Richmond Terminal Subdivision. and continue along four-lane Chamberlayne Avenue. US 301 and US 1 meet the northern end of SR 197 at Laburnum Avenue on their way to the northern edge of Richmond. At Azalea Avenue, US 1 and US 301 diverge; US 1 turns west onto Azalea Avenue and then north onto Brook Road while US 301 continues north on Chamberlayne Avenue concurrent with SR 2, which has its southern terminus at the intersection. Richmond to Potomac River US 301 and SR 2 exit the city of Richmond and enter Henrico County. A short distance north of the city limits, the carriageways split, with the southbound lanes crossing to the west of I-95. Several ramps connect the two highways with I-95 in the forested area around Upham Brook. After I-95 veers northwest and the carriageways rejoin, US 301 and SR 2 pass through the suburb of Chamberlayne. The highways meet the eastern end of Parham Road, the main east-west boulevard of Henrico County, just before crossing the Chickahominy River into Hanover County. US 301 and SR 2 meet I-295 at a cloverleaf interchange just north of the county line. The two highways continue through a suburban area where they pass under CSX's Piedmont Subdivision. North of Hanover High School, US 301 and SR 2 reduce to two lanes and the road's name changes to Hanover Courthouse Road. At Hanover Courthouse, the highway meets the eastern end of SR 54 (Patrick Henry Road). US 301 and SR 2 also pass the 18th century Hanover County Courthouse, where Patrick Henry argued the case of the Parson's Cause, and the Hanover Tavern, where the Barksdale Theater opened the first dinner theater in the United States in 1953.

The road, now named Richmond Turnpike, intersects SR 30 (Dawn Boulevard) in the hamlet of Bowersville, also known as Dawn. The two highways run straight for ; near the north end of the straight, the highways cross the Mattaponi River. At the north end of the straight, SR 2 and US 301 expand to a four-lane divided highway that lasts until the two highways pass under SR 207 (Bowling Green Bypass). SR 2 and US 301 Business continue straight into the town of Bowling Green as Main Street while US 301 turns onto a two-lane ramp that leads to the Bowling Green Bypass. US 301 joins the four-lane divided bypass at SR 207's eastern terminus. After passing around the east side of the town of Bowling Green, the U.S. Highway receives the northern end of its business route, Broaddus Avenue. US 301 continues northeast as A.P. Hill Boulevard, which enters the eponymous military installation. East of the U.S. Army base's main entrance, the U.S. Highway passes through the forested Army reservation for without an intersection. Near the eastern edge of Fort A.P. Hill, US 301 passes the site of the Garrett farmhouse and barn where John Wilkes Booth was killed by federal troops 12 days after he had assassinated Abraham Lincoln. At the eastern edge of the military base, the highway intersects US 17 (Tidewater Trail). US 301 becomes an undivided highway as it passes through the town of Port Royal as Main Street, then uses the James Madison Memorial Bridge to cross the Rappahannock River into King George County. View south along US 301 in King George County just after crossing the Nice Bridge from Maryland US 301 continues north as James Madison Parkway and passes Emmanuel Episcopal Church and Belle Grove, the birthplace of James Madison, in the hamlet of Port Conway on the north side of the river. The U.S. Highway intersects SR 3 (Kings Highway) at Office Hall and SR 205 (Ridge Road) at Edgehill. Both highways connect US 301 with King George, the county seat of King George County. US 301 continues northeast to Owens, where the highway has intersections with SR 218 (Windsor Drive) and SR 206 (Dahlgren Road). SR 206 leads to the community of Dahlgren, which is home to the Dahlgren Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. US 301 parallels the northern perimeter of the naval reservation on its way to the Potomac River. The U.S. Highway reduces to two lanes immediately before using the Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge to cross the Potomac River into Maryland. History US 301 south of Petersburg was part of the U.S. Highway System from its beginning in 1926, though it was part of U.S. Route 17-1 until 1932. The extension north from Petersburg was added in late 1940, when the Potomac River Bridge opened. Prior to 1933, the road from Petersburg south into North Carolina was State Route 24. The initial SR 24 was a short route from Emporia southwest to North Carolina along current State Route 627 (via Brink and Barley). It connected at the state line to North Carolina Highway 40.1924 map The \\"Halifax Road\\" from North Carolina via Emporia to the junction with State Route 35 (then State Route 5) south of Petersburg was not assigned as part of the initial state highway system in 1918. In March 1923, a delegation from Petersburg appeared before the State Highway Commission, requesting that this be added to the system. They claimed that the road was to be included in the system, but it was left out through an error. SR 24 south of Emporia was realigned in April 1924 to the present US 301 alignment, and North Carolina Highway 40 was realigned at around the same time to match.The Highways of North Carolina: N.C. 40 Over the next several years, the Halifax Road from Emporia to SR 35 was added to the state highway system as SR 24. \\"Dinwiddie - From Railroad crossing at Carson to a point four miles (6 km) south on the Halifax Road\\" \\"Greensville - Emporia north to a point four miles (6 km) on the Halifax Road and From that point to a point north on the Halifax Road\\" \\"Prince George - Extension Route 24 to a point Five Miles North towards Route 35\\" Greensville - Extension Route 24 to a point Five Miles North towards Stony Creek\\" By 1927, Route 24 had replaced Route 35 north of their junction to Petersburg, and was completely concurrent with U.S. Route 17-1. The number was decommissioned in the 1933 renumbering, at which time the present State Route 24 was designated. Major intersectionsSpecial routes=Petersburg alternate route U.S. Route 301 Alternate (US 301 Alternate) is an alternate route of US 301 in the city of Petersburg. The highway runs between junctions with US 301 in the southern and downtown sections of the city. US 301 Alternate follows Sycamore Street between its southern junction with US 301 in the Walnut Hill neighborhood and Old Towne Petersburg. At Wythe Street, which carries US 1, US 460 Business, and SR 36 eastbound, the route splits. Northbound US 301 Alternate follows Jefferson Street and 3rd Street north to reconnect with US 301. The southbound alternate route follows Adams Street, one block of Washington Street, and Sycamore Street to reconnect with the northbound direction at the intersection of Sycamore and Wythe. Bowling Green business route U.S. Route 301 Business (US 301 Business) is a business route of US 301 in Caroline County. The highway runs between junctions with US 301 on the south and east sides of Bowling Green. US 301 Business begins south of the town of Bowling Green where US 301 turns onto its two-way ramp to join the Bowling Green Bypass. The business route runs concurrently with SR 2 along Main Street into the town. US 301 Business turns east onto Broaddus Avenue, which heads west as SR 207 Business, and leaves the town before reconnecting with US 301 between the town and Fort A.P. Hill.

It replaced an earlier compilation, Geffen's 1987 release Elton John's Greatest Hits Vol. 3. This was necessitated because of a shift in the control of copyrights and a resulting reshuffling of compilation albums. Background Ultimate ownership of Elton John's recordings had always rested with the artist's British labels. Hence DJM/This Record Company Ltd. owned all of John's recorded output up to and including 1976's Here and There while John's own royalty collection company (alternately called \\"Sackville\\" and \\"Happenstance\\") owned the recordings from 1976's \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" single and Blue Moves album onwards, which were released outside North America by The Rocket Record Company. However, in the United States and Canada, this was obscured by the labels distributing the same material locally. MCA and its subsidiaries released all of the artist's product up through 1980's 21 at 33 (though Blue Moves had also borne the Rocket logo), resuming with 1987's Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra while Geffen released everything from 1981's The Fox through 1986's Leather Jackets. 1977's Greatest Hits Volume II collection had, on both sides of the Atlantic, included material owned by both British proprietors. This had required an agreement between DJM and The Rocket Record Company in the UK, but not in North America where all recordings in question were under MCA anyway. Geffen's \\"Volume 3\\" compilation had simply picked up where its predecessor had left off. In 1992, Elton John signed to PolyGram Records worldwide. The deal gave PolyGram the rights to all of John's pre-1976 recordings (as well as his future output once his then-current MCA contract was satisfied). This meant that Greatest Hits Volume II could no longer be presented as before. Two years before, MCA had acquired Geffen Records. In the new (and as of 2007 still current) configuration, 1976's \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\" were shifted over to the new \\"Volume 3\\" (to be replaced on their original collection by earlier, previously uncollected songs.) The new collection also included \\"Who Wears These Shoes?\\", a minor 1984 hit that had been passed up by the earlier collection. To make room for these additions, two songs from the Geffen collection were purged, namely the 1983 album (title) track \\"Too Low For Zero\\" and the 1986 non-hit \\"Heartache All Over the World\\". The running order bore little resemblance to that of the Geffen compilation. PolyGram was bought by MCA's successor Universal Music Group in 1998, thus consolidating worldwide distribution rights to all of John's catalogue (which included the soundtrack to the film Friends, originally released on Paramount Records, then reissued on ABC Records after buying the Paramount label, ABC Records itself was sold to MCA in 1979). Elton John currently co-owns his entire catalogue with Universal. The album is currently available from Island Records. After the consummation of the Universal/PolyGram merger, it was decided that Island would act as one of two American labels for Elton John (Island handled the back catalogue, while Universal, and later Interscope and Decca Records would handle new releases), and Mercury Records would be his international label. In the US, it was certified gold in January 1994, platinum in October 1995 and 2x platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA.

The station serves a major shopping corridor of West Philadelphia on 40th Street, as well as the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, which lies three blocks south of the station. The station is served by SEPTA City Bus routes 30, 40 and LUCY. The station also serves as the inbound terminal for the SEPTA subway-surface trolley lines when services are diverted from the Market Street tunnels ‚Äì‚Äì on Mondays from 12:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. and during any other unforeseen circumstances. All five trolley routes terminate at the intersection 40th Street and Market Street, just outside entrances to the Market‚ÄìFrankford platforms. History Newly-designed station entrance built in 2017 40th Street station was opened on November 6, 1955 by the Philadelphia Transportation Company, built to replace the elevated station that opened in 1907 as part of Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company's (PRT) original Market Street subway‚Äìelevated line from to , which was elevated west of 23rd Street. The PRT announced a project to bury the elevated tracks between 23rd to 46th streets in the 1920s. The tunnel from 23rd to 32nd streets was completed by 1933, but construction on the remaining segment was put on hiatus due to the Great Depression and World War II. The PRT went bankrupt in 1939 and was reorganized as the PTC, which began building the rest of the tunnel in 1947. The station was renovated in 2017, bringing it to ADA accessibility requirements. Two elevators were installed, one for each platform, each of the four entrance stairwells were covered with artistic screens, and underground lighting and tiles were replaced. The project was completed on October 21, 2017, at a total cost of $10.9 million. Station layout The station has two side platforms with separate fare control on either side. West of the station, the tracks climb out of a portal near 44th Street and run west as an elevated line.

The road houses several landmarks namely, Clifford Pier, Change Alley, Hitachi Tower, Ocean Towers and Ocean Financial Centre.  History  Built around 1864 and 1865, it originally referred to the sea wall designed in 1858. The sea wall was named after Captain (later Colonel) George Chancellor Collyer, the army engineer of the Madras Engineers who was appointed Chief Engineer in 1862 for the fortification of the colony. Collyer did a lot of work at town planning and was connected to the scheme of the Tanjong Pagar Dock. In the past, there was no road named \\"Collyer Quay\\" with all the buildings along the island's shoreline were directing facing the sea. The buildings were linked by a continuous verandah on the second storey, where people walked from one building to another. Steam trams plied the quay in 1882, and by the 1900s, a new generation of buildings started to appear. Currently, some have up to six buildings built on the site such as the HSBC Building, Hitachi Tower and Ocean Towers. A simple memorial has been erected near Clifford Pier, to pay tribute to the immigrants of different races for their contributions to developing the nation. The foundation stone was laid by the first president Encik Yusof Bin Ishak. Collyer Quay skyline in 2017 In Cantonese, the road was known as hoong tang and in Hokkien, ang theng lor, meaning \\"red lamp road\\", after the red warning beacon lights at Johnston's Pier which was later rebuilt to make way for the Clifford Pier. The Chinese also called it tho kho au, meaning \\"at the back of the godowns\\". The original development of the quay had its first buildings facing Commercial Square (Raffles Place) and only outhouses and sheds were facing the shore. Until the late 1960s the front of Clifford Pier was a carpark. After office hours the carpark was transformed into a gathering place for musicians, mobile foodstalls and prostitutes. The carpark later made way for road-widening and construction of new developments. New developments An artist's impression of the new developments Construction of the Fullerton Bay Hotel in 2007 There are new developments at the water front property along Collyer Quay between Marina Boulevard and One Fullerton. A new waterfront hotel, called the Fullerton Bay Hotel, opened in 2010. The historical buildings, these being Clifford Pier and the former Customs Harbour Branch Building, were incorporated into the new developments. The hotel and the historical buildings are connected to incorporate the Marina Promenade and to allow free pedestrian traffic along Marina Bay. A new office building, OUE Bayfront was also built to replace the former OUE building which stood beside Clifford Pier.

Overview The SLG originated politically in the 1971 split in the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI), between Gerry Healy's British Socialist Labour League (SLL) and Pierre Lambert's French Internationalist Communist Organisation (OCI). Betty Hamilton, an SLL founder and a Trotskyist since the 1930s, had sided with Lambert in 1971 but remained isolated, although still formally an SLL member until 1974. John and Mary Archer, also Trotskyists since the 1930s, had split with the SLL in the mid 1960s, disagreeing with its pullout from the Labour Party after 1964, with the exception of a few secret 'deep entrists'. They continued to work as individuals in the Labour Party in North London but for ten years were not active in an organisation. They were contacted in 1975 by Robin Blick (now a musician) and Mark Jenkins, (now a playwright in Wales) both leading SLL members who had broken with Healy in the early 1970s and formed a discussion circle centred on a critique of Healy which tended to see the SLL's move to become the Workers' Revolutionary Party (WRP) as similar to the Stalinist Third Period. Harry Vince (now an artist) and Ken Stratford had broken with the SLL in the late 1960s, arguing it was becoming a sect increasingly separated from the working class. They had joined and been expelled from International Socialists and Workers' Fight, discussed with the Militant and Chartists and were active in the Labour Party, forming a small group called Socialist Action. Regis Faugier (now a linguist) was a French ex-SLL member in St Helens who had organised a group of supporters outside the SLL, including Jean Faugier (now a nursing academic and consultant) Vince, Stratford and the Faugiers were in touch with the OCI from 1972 and in contact with Betty Hamilton from 1973. Split In late 1974 the two groupings, mainly based in London, the larger around Blick and Jenkins (perhaps 20 plus including associates in Reading and Swindon) and another around Vince, Stratford and Faugier (perhaps 12 plus including associates in St Helens) began planning publication of a journal called the Marxist Bulletin. As a result, they became known as the Bulletin Group, aligned with Lambert's Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International to which the Hamilton-Vince- Stratford group were already linked. A heterogeneous tendency, they attempted to act as an 'external' faction of the SLL, with the aim of winning over more SLL members. The Marxist Bulletin, which commented on SLL-WRP (the Socialist Labour League had become the Workers Revolutionary Party) politics and activities and gave a voice to the ideas of the OCRFI, was successfully infiltrated into the SLL, angering Healy who accused the group of writing substantial sections of documents circulated internally by SLL trade union leader Alan Thornett, who had formed an opposition grouping within the SLL and was soon to leave and form the Workers Socialist League. Healy supporters physically threatened Bulletin Group members and a leading SLL member boasted publicly that houses had been burgled and infiltrators sent in. Thornett did have meetings with Blick and Jenkins from the Bulletin Group, who reached him via Kate Blakeney (a leading member of the WRP) in Reading and Ray Howells in Swindon. The initial document upon which the Thornett opposition was founded was in fact co-written by Bulletin Group members, essentially Robin Blick, in consultation with Mark Jenkins and John Archer, but this did not lead to an ongoing political relationship. Lambert wanted Robin Blick to lead the Bulletin Group as open supporters of the OCRFI, with parallel entry work in the Labour Party, where the Vince-Stratford wing and the Archers already worked as entrists. The grouping around Blick and Jenkins were holding secret caucus meetings within the Bulletin Group and moving away from support for the OCI. Harry Vince left the Bulletin Group and moved to Ireland in 1975, where he joined the League for a Workers Republic. Mark Jenkins and then Robin Blick, along with most of their supporters, such as Tom Hillier, Nick Peck and Robin Brown, began to question Trotskyism-Leninism from about 1976 and left the Bulletin Group over a period. Robin and Karen Blick developed 'anti- Soviet' politics and were later founders of the Polish Solidarity Campaign. Kate Blakeney moved to Australia and was active in the USec (United Secretariat of the Fourth International) affiliate there for a time. John and Mary Archer remained loyal to the OCRFI-Lambert, but hostile to Betty Hamilton and Ken Stratford. They regrouped some newer student members centred on Marcus Giaquinto and John Ford (now academics), who had never been members of the SLL-WRP, with other members in Reading, Swindon and Norwich and kept the name Bulletin Group. Some of them engaged in entrist work in the Labour Party. They continued with the publication of the Bulletin until 1977 but its influence on the SLL had fast diminished after the Thornett group split and it had many internal tensions. Betty Hamilton, Ken Stratford, Regis Faugier and their associates formed a separate British Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. The two small groupings were both affiliated to the Lambert OCRFI but had little relations with each other. In 1979 Vince moved back from Ireland at Lambert's request and the two groups joined together to form a new grouping, which called itself the Socialist Labour Group (SLG). This was enlarged in 1981 by a merger with some supporters of Nahuel Moreno from the IMG, including Mike Phipps (now an Editorial Board member of Labour Left Briefing), and the SLG affiliated to the Parity Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International when that was formed. Active in Labour Party The Socialist Labour Group remained active in the Labour Party, student unions and trade unions until 1988, publishing Unite and Fight, Socialist Newsletter and later Fourth Internationalist. It was also active in the Troops Out Movement, Labour Committee on Ireland and the London H-Blocks Committee and took part in various international solidarity campaigns linked to the OCRFI, PCRFI and FI-ICR, including anti-apartheid campaigning and support work for Solidarnosc and movements in Latin America. However, differences between them and the leadership of the OCI appeared from 1985 when Harry Vince, along with 6 other members of Lambert's international leadership, criticised Lambert's Fourth International - International Centre of Reconstruction (FI-ICR) for, among other things, proposing to proclaim itself as the 'reconstructed' Fourth International, the continued Lambertist insistence on a decades long 'pre-revolutionary' period, (leading Francois de Massot to say that the British miners' strike was not a historic defeat), differences over tactics in Latin America and (for some) corrupt methods within the OCI. In 1987, all but four of the SLG sided with the wing of the FI-ICR linked to Luis Favre, Camilo Gonzalez, Roch Denis, Carol Coulter and others. The SLG was briefly part of a Liaison Committee with those (in Brazil, Colombia, Quebec, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and France) who broke with Lambert in 1987. It also held discussions with St√©phane Just but by 1988 was discussing joining with the International Socialist Group (ISG) which was a section of the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USec). The SLG dissolved itself in 1989 and its remaining members joined the ISG, although most of them left over the next few years. Harry Vince did not join the ISG and moved to Ireland where he became an editor of The Irish Reporter magazine. Other prominent ex-members of the Socialist Labour Group include Martin Wicks, (a leading RMT member and housing rights campaigner), Steve Lloyd, a CPSA/PCS activist, Mary Godfrey and Alan Green, (who became National Secretary of the Scottish Socialist Party). The few members of the SLG who remained loyal to the OCI in 1987 were centred on Charlie Charalambous. This grouping had a tenuous existence for a few years, but John Archer, who had joined the ISG with the SLG majority, decided to rejoin with Lambert's international grouping and formed a small circle within the ISG supportive of the FI-ICR, including academic Helen Peters. In 1991 it split and rejoined with the 'Charalambous group' to form the British Committee of the European Workers' Alliance, a new Lambertist group which undertook entrism in the Labour Party and occasionally published the Fourth Internationalist Bulletin. Mike Calvert (sometimes known as Frank Wainwright) worked closely with John Archer at that time but later had his own differences with the Lambertists and is now associated with Workers Action. John Archer died in 2000 still seeing 'entry work' as his main political thrust. Today, this grouping is led by Stefan Cholewka, a Labour Party member in Rochdale. The British Section of the International Liaison Committee for a Workers' International. is a small group which occasionally publishes Workers' Unity and The Link. Regis Faugier, although not a member, has sometimes been associated with this grouping.

He collaborated with H. P. Lovecraft on \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\". Biography Price was born at Fowler, California. Originally intending to be a career soldier, Price graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point; he served in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, and with the American military in Mexico and the Philippines. He was a champion fencer and boxer, an amateur Orientalist, and a student of the Arabic language; science-fiction author Jack Williamson, in his 1984 autobiography Wonder's Child, called E. Hoffmann Price a \\"real live soldier of fortune\\". In his literary career, Hoffmann Price produced fiction for a wide range of publications, from Argosy to Terror Tales, from Speed Detective to Spicy Mystery Stories. Yet he was most readily identified as a Weird Tales writer, one of the group who wrote regularly for editor Farnsworth Wright, a group that included Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith. Price published 24 solo stories in Weird Tales between 1925 and 1950, plus three collaborations with Otis Adelbert Kline, and his works with Lovecraft, noted above. His first sale was to Droll Stories in 1924, followed almost immediately by the first of scores of acceptances by Weird Tales., \\"The Rajah's Gift\\" (Jan 1925). Price's \\"The Peacock's Shadow\\" was the cover story in the November 1926 Weird Tales \\"The Dragoman's Jest\\", a collaboration between Price and Otis Adelbert Kline, was the cover story in the Winter 1932 issue of Oriental Stories Some of Price's stories aroused controversy; \\"The Stranger from Kurdistan\\" (1925), a story which featured a dialogue between a certain personage and Satan, was criticised by some readers as blasphemous but proved popular with Weird Tales readers. (Lovecraft professed to find it especially powerful). \\"The Infidel's Daughter\\" (1927), a satire on the Ku Klux Klan, also angered some Southern readers, but Wright defended the story.See The Weird Tales Story, by Robert Weinberg, 1977. Price worked in a range of popular genres‚Äîincluding science fiction, horror, crime, and fantasy‚Äîbut he was best known for adventure stories with Oriental settings and atmosphere. Price also contributed to Farnsworth Wright's short-lived magazine The Magic Carpet (1930‚Äì34), along with Kline, Howard, Smith, and other Weird Tales regulars. Like many other pulp-fiction writers, Price could not support himself and his family on his income from literature. Living in New Orleans in the 1930s, he worked for a time for the Union Carbide Corporation. Nonetheless he managed to travel widely and maintain friendships with many other pulp writers, including Kline and Edmond Hamilton. On a trip to Texas in the mid-1930s, Price was the only pulp writer to meet Robert E. Howard face to face. He was also the only man known to have met Howard and also H. P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith (the great 'Triumvirate' of Weird Tales writers) in person. Over the course of his long life, Price made reminiscences of many significant figures in pulp fiction, Howard, Lovecraft, and Hamilton among them. Late in life, Price experienced a major literary resurgence. In the 1970s and '80s he issued a series of SF, fantasy, and adventure novels, published in paperback; The Devil Wives of Li Fong (1979) is one noteworthy example. He also had published two collections of his pulp stories during his lifetime--Strange Gateways and Far Lands, Other Days. Price was one of the first speakers at San Francisco's Maltese Falcon Society in 1981. He received the World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984. A collection of his literary memoirs, Book of the Dead: Friends of Yesteryear, Fictioneers & Others, was published posthumously in 2001. His writing friends and colleagues included Richard L. Tierney, H. P. Lovecraft, August Derleth, Jack Williamson, Edmond Hamilton, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Henry Kuttner, Seabury Quinn, Otis Adelbert Kline, Ralph Milne Farley, Robert Spencer Carr, and Farnsworth Wright among others. Price was a Buddhist and a supporter of the Republican Party.\\"Price, E(dgar) Hoffmann\\", in Encyclopedia of Fantasy by John Clute and John Grant. He died at Redwood City, California, in 1988. H. P. Lovecraft When Lovecraft visited New Orleans in June 1932, Howard telegraphed Price to alert him to the visitor's presence, and the two writers spent much of the following week together. A disproven myth claims that Price took Lovecraft to a New Orleans brothel, where Lovecraft was amused to find that several of the employees there were fans of his work; the same apocryphal story was originally told about Seabury Quinn sometime earlier.Joshi and Schultz, p. 212. The meeting of Price and Lovecraft began a correspondence that continued until Lovecraft's death. They even proposed at one time forming a writing team whose output would, \\"conservatively estimated, run to a million words a month\\", in Lovecraft's whimsical prediction. They planned to use the pseudonym \\"Etienne Marmaduke de Marigny\\" for their collaboration; a similar name was used for a character in \\"Through the Gates of the Silver Key\\", the only collaboration of Price and Lovecraft to transpire.Carter, pp. 94-95. Another collaboration between Lovecraft and Hoffmann Price is the short tale \\"Tarbis of the Lake\\". That story had its origins in Price's enthusiasm for an earlier Lovecraft tale. \\"One of my favorite HPL stories was, and still is, 'The Silver Key',\\" Price wrote in a 1944 memoir. \\"In telling him of the pleasure I had had in rereading it, I suggested a sequel to account for protagonist Randolph Carter's doings after his disappearance.\\"E. Hoffman Price, The Acolyte, 1944; cited in Carter, p. 93. After convincing an apparently reluctant Lovecraft to collaborate on such a sequel, Price wrote a 6,000-word draft in August 1932; in April 1933, Lovecraft produced a 14,000-word version that left unchanged, by Price's estimate, \\"fewer than fifty of my original words,\\"Carter, p. 93. though An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia reports that Lovecraft \\"kept as many of Price's conceptions as possible, as well as some of his language.\\"Joshi and Schultz, p. 213. In any case, Price was pleased with the result, writing that Lovecraft \\"was right of course in discarding all but the basic outline. I could only marvel that he had made so much of my inadequate and bungling start.\\"Carter, p. 94. The story appeared under both authors' bylines in the July 1934 issue of Weird Tales; Price's draft was published as \\"The Lord of Illusion\\" in Crypt of Cthulhu No. 10 in 1982. Price visited Lovecraft in Providence in the summer of 1933. When he and a mutual friend showed up at Lovecraft's house with a six-pack of beer, the teetotaling Lovecraft is said to have remarked, \\"And what are you going to do with so much of it?\\" Bibliography Cover of the pulp magazine \\"Spicy- Adventure Stories\\" (August 1935, vol. 2, no. 5) featuring Death's Handmaiden \\"Tiger Cat\\", a collaboration between Price and Otis Adelbert Kline, was the cover story in the January 1940 Weird Tales Science fiction *Operation Misfit (1980) *Operation Longlife (1983) *Operation Exile (1985) *Operation Isis (1986) Fantasy *The Devil Wives of Li Fong (1979) *The Jade Enchantress (1982) Collections *Strange Gateways (1967) *Far Lands, Other Days (1975) *Three Cliff Cragin Stories (1987) *Satan's Daughter and Other Tales from the Pulps (2004) *Valley of the Tall Gods and Other Tales from the Pulps (2006) Nonfiction *The Weird Tales Story (1999) *Book of the Dead: Friends of Yesteryear, Fictioneers and Others (2001) NotesReferences *S.

P. Lovecraft, written on June 5, 1922. This story was first published in the National Amateur in May 1923. It's shorter than most of Lovecraft's other short stories, and is essentially a fragment. The story is based on one of Lovecraft's dreams, a common technique. Synopsis This story is told from the first person view of an unnamed narrator. The story describes a surreal dreamscape. The narrator wanders through his garden one evening and, in the moonlight, witnesses many bizarre sights. He soon reaches a stream: > Silent and sparkling, bright and baleful, those moon-cursed waters hurried I > knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotus-blossoms > fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped despairingly into > the stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven bridge, and > staring back with the sinister resignation of calm, dead faces. After crossing a bridge, he realizes the garden has no end. Where the walls once stood are now trees and shrubs, with terrifying stone idols between each corner. The dead faces urge him on farther and farther, as the stream becomes a river before leading him to the shore of a sea. Suddenly, the lotus-faces disappear as the moon sinks into the horizon: > And as I saw therein the lotus-faces vanish, I longed for nets that I might > capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon > the night. But when that moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed > from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old spires that the waves almost > uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed. And knowing > that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not wish > again to speak with the lotus-faces. Soon, he finds himself starring down at the ruins of an ancient city, a city of the dead. The narrator sees a condor and wishes to ask it about the people he knows who have died. He watches the sea for a while, observing ripples in it, which he attributes as sea worms. He suddenly feels a chill and notices something far-off beneath the waves: > Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw > that the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim > I had seen before. And when I saw that the reef was but the black basalt > crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim > moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below, I > shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest > the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and > treacherous yellow moon. Fleeing this monstrous thing, he swims towards the sunken city: > And to escape this relentless thing, I plunged gladly and unhesitantly into > the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat sea- > worms feast upon the world's dead. The speaker clearly prefers death instead of madness to this perceived greater-horror revealed in carven grandeur. The tale concludes without confirming whether this was the ending of the speaker's life or not. Publication history Source:From the H. P.

It was built by Mr. Walter Raymond of Raymond & Whitcomb Travel Agency of Boston, Mass. The hotel was built atop Bacon Hill which lies between Pasadena and South Pasadena and was renamed Raymond Hill with the opening of the hotel in 1886. The original hotel, a grand and unequivocal Victorian edifice was burned to the ground in 1895. A second building, of a later and more fireproof style, was erected in 1901 and equally replaced the older in grandeur. The hotel was foreclosed following the Great Depression and was razed for commercial development. History=\\"Pasadena Paradise\\"War Veterans, Health Seekers, and Tourists In 1883 Walter Raymond had ventured west the young community of Pasadena, California, described as a sleepy village of 1,500 people. Seeking to excite business in the transcontinental tour market, he noticed that the yet unincorporated town had no hotels for visitors. This piqued his interest in establishing one, thereby purchasing a hard granite hilltop called Bacon Hill as the site for his new Raymond Hotel. The dynamiting and grading off of of the hilltop came to more than the twice Raymond‚Äôs estimates, and he turned to his father Emmons Raymond for assistance. The older Raymond was president of the Boston & Passumsic Railroad and one of the 40 original stockholders of the Santa Fe Railroad. Interested in at least surveying the site of the hotel, Emmons arrived in Pasadena during a downpour and sat under an oak tree listening to his son expound over the beauty of the Southern California area. But the rain poured down leaving Walter hopeless in convincing Emmons. When the sun finally did break through the clouded sky it was a sight the old man had never experienced in his life and he agreed to finance the rest of Walter‚Äôs construction. Royal Raymond - The First Major Resort Hotel in the San Gabriel Valley The original Raymond Hotel, built 1886, burned down 1895. The new Raymond Hotel opened with a gala ball on November 17, 1886, and enjoyed nine successful seasons (winters). However, the original structure was a wood framed Victorian with a shingled roof boasting some 200 rooms ‚Äî and 80 chimneys. April 14, 1895 (Easter Sunday) On Easter Sunday 1895, a spark from a chimney set the roof on fire and the hotel and all its contents burned to the ground in 40 minutes. At the time there were 165 guests staying at the hotel, but most were at church, and as fortune would have it, no one was hurt though all their possessions were lost. Walter Raymond was not to be disheartened by this loss since he had caught the Southern California fever. He immediately began promoting the area through publications and authors of publications who could attest to the virtues of the area. He attempted to augment the insurance money through a $250,000 bond issue, but there were too few people in the area with enough money to support it. Finally, a good friend and seasonal resident of the hotel, Mr. Richard T. Crane of Crane Plumbing, Chicago, agreed to a $300,000 mortgage which was applied to the building of a second hotel. The Raymond Hotel is Rebuilt The second Raymond Hotel built 1901, torn down 1934. The second hotel opened on December 19, 1901, and was met with immediate success especially from those who had lost their winter residence for 6 years. The registry was filled with names of moguls from the East: Pullman, Schwab, Harriman, Swift, Armour, Rockefeller, Morgan, Carnegie, and of course R. T. Crane who spent his remaining winters at the Raymond. The newer facility had a larger foundation base, was more fireproof, and sported an architectural style more in keeping with the time. It had 300 rooms many with private baths, which was not a feature of the original. Fireplaces gave way to steam heating; the wood exterior was exchanged for concrete and stucco; the roof was tiled, not shingled, and electric lighting came with the plans. The plans also included an abundance of fire doors and extinguishers. Guests 1911 Raymond Hotel adGuests invariably arrived by train, the mainline Santa Fe which stopped at Raymond Station at the bottom of the hill. Many had private cars that would park on the side spur near the station. All guests were ferried by a horse-drawn bus to the hotel at the top of the hill. Much to the dismay of many guests, the old station closed down in deference to a newer station built up the tracks closer to downtown Pasadena. Guests were then forced to take an auto bus the extra distance to the hotel. Part of the success of the Raymond was the transcontinental tours which came through the hotel. The tours were discontinued as the onslaught of newcomers repeatedly bothered the regular guests, who by now were a mainstay of the hotel. In 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt visited Pasadena and the Raymond on his Panama Canal campaign. However, the crowd was not near the size of the one who came to see Charlie Chaplin as he appeared for lunch with opera singer Nellie Melba. Amenities A hotel of this size of course had several amenities and Raymond always set aside profits (or borrowed money) to add something he thought might be important for business. Even though the hotel only opened from December to April (it never opened year round), Raymond kept himself busy over the summer with some sort of improvement. The dining room was the largest room in the house able to seat 400 people. Pasadena City, which boasted of being a ‚Äúdry‚Äù town, had an ordinance disallowing the sales of alcohol ‚Äî except to the hotel guests. The hotel had a large nursery operation with 500 American Beauty rose plants, of carnations and a reported 3,000 pansies. There was a nine-hole golf course on a lot alongside the hotel, and though it was humble in comparison, it was one of the few good attractions in the area. Much of the landscaping was done by the suggestion of the Mr. Theodore Payne, a famous local horticulturist of the time. The hotel also had card rooms, writing rooms, a reception room, and in the basement was a pool and billiards parlor ‚Äî with a secret bar. Local competition The Raymond Hotel had its steady guests in spite of the fact that it also had competition from other hotels about Pasadena that were opened year round. Even Raymond‚Äôs own chief lieutenant opened up his own hotel, the Wentworth, which within ten years had become financially distressed and was assumed by the grand estate of Henry E. Huntington, thus named the Huntington Hotel. There were the Hotel Green, a few blocks north on Raymond Avenue, the Vista Del Arroyo which overlooked the Arroyo Seco, and the Maryland Hotel on Colorado Boulevard. Raymond had reduced the $300,000 mortgage to $75,000, but come the Great Depression (1931) and the large traffic from the east fizzled. The bank which assumed the original loan from Mr. Crane foreclosed on the hotel, and Walter Raymond lost the property. The owner of the Maryland Hotel, Daniel M. Linnard, sought to manage the property for a while, but in 1934, the year of Walter Raymond‚Äôs death, the hotel was torn down for commercial development.

Nikki was a starring vehicle for Nikki Cox, who had previously starred in another WB sitcom, Unhappily Ever After, which ran for five seasons. Looking to capitalize on Cox's popularity, Bruce Helford created a sitcom that featured her as the title character. Synopsis Cox portrays Nikki White, a Las Vegas showgirl living in Las Vegas with her husband Dwight White (Nick von Esmarch), a professional wrestler. The couple is portrayed as working class, attempting to follow their passions while finding fame and fortune in Las Vegas. Also in the cast are Nikki's best friend and fellow dancer Mary (Susan Egan), and Dwight's boss Jupiter (Toby Huss). Also a recurring character were Dwight's mother Marion (Christine Estabrook), who is angry with Nikki for \\"luring\\" her son into a marriage and away from a safe, secure job with a future as a tax attorney; Ken and Alice Gillespie (Todd Robert Anderson and Jacqueline Heinze), Nikki and Dwight's conservative neighbors; In season one, each episode started with a musical number, where Nikki and her fellow showgirls at \\"the worst casino in Las Vegas\\" perform a dance. Their costumes included Godzilla, cockroaches (dancing to \\"We Are Family\\"), brides who remove their dresses and veils to reveal red devil costumes and horns, and once she appeared as the severed head of Marie Antoinette. In the second episode of season two, Nikki loses her job when the casino is sold. Similar to Murphy Brown, all of the episodes in season one, plus some in season two, have a different song be the theme song, while Nikki performed a dance routine. However, in season two, the theme song changed to a standardized intro, to a remixed version of \\"She's a Lady\\" by Tom Jones.

The station transmits with an effective radiated power of 100 watts, providing coverage over an approximate 15-mile (25 kilometer) radius. WRUC also streams its programming on Internet radio. The station's offices and studios are located in the Reamer Campus Center on the Union College campus. WRUC's slogan is \\"The First Station In The Nation\\". The station traces its history back to October 14, 1920, the date an amateur station located at Union College first began making regular broadcasts. However, WRUC's priority claim is not widely accepted. There are continuity issues, because, after the demise of Union's broadcasting station, WRL, in 1924, the college did not resume any broadcasting activities until 1941. In addition, there are several stations that claim even longer histories. Programming WRUC is entirely run by the students of Union College, and only operates regularly when the college is in session. The station offers listeners an eclectic mix of alternative programming, Union sports and news. The current WRUC FM station was first licensed in 1975 as a 10 watt station on 90.9 FM, with the call letters, standing for \\"Radio Union College\\", the same as the identifier used for a long running campus-wide \\"carrier current\\" station. In 1983, the transmitting frequency was changed to 89.7 and the power increased to 100 watts.

Bently, Radio Club at Union College secretary), QST magazine, December 1920, page 64. Although WRUC as an FM station only dates back to 1975, Union College has a long history of experimental radio work and pioneer broadcasting, much of which was conducted by students. In the fall of 1915, a \\"Technical and Training School\\" station license was issued to \\"Walter L. Upson (Union College)\\", with the call sign \\"2YU\\",\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 1915, page 2. The leading \\"2\\" in 2YU's call sign indicated that the station was located in the second Radio Inspection District, while the \\"Y\\" designated the station as having a \\"Technical and Training School\\" license. which was operated in conjunction with a newly formed Radio Club. In the summer of 1916, Dr. E. J. Berg and Dr. Alex Stevenson installed a spark-gap transmitter at the College, which could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. By late 1916 experiments were also being conducted using the newly developed vacuum- tube transmitters, which were capable of making audio transmissions. Included as part of this work was a series of test radio concerts. However, upon the entrance of the United States into World War One, effective April 7, 1917 the government ordered all civilian radio stations, including 2YU, shut down for the duration of the conflict.\\"Union College\\", Education's Own Stations by S. E. Frost, Jr., Ph.D., 1937, pages 437-441. Amateur station 2ADD (1920) After the war, in the fall of 1919 civilian radio licenses began to be issued again, including a standard amateur station authorization with the call sign 2ADD granted to Wendell King\\"Wendell Wilford King (1897-1965)\\" (lansingburghhistoricalsociety.org) at the Union College Electrical Laboratory.Second District: Alphabetically by Owners of Stations, Amateur Radio Stations of the United States: June 30, 1920 edition, page 35. The fact that the first letter in 2ADD's call sign fell in the range from A to W indicated the station had a standard Amateur license, which was normally limited to operating on a wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz). The Radio Club was reformed and resumed activities, which included a more organized series of entertainment broadcasts intended to be heard by the local community. The first of these broadcasts was made on October 14, 1920,\\"Union Again Pioneer of American College World; Music by Wireless Telephone Latest Radio Feat\\", The Concordiensis, October 16, 1920, pages 1, 4. and a letter dated October 22, 1920 that appeared in the December 1920 issue of the amateur radio magazine QST announced that the College would be broadcasting weekly radio concerts \\"every Thursday evening from 8:00 to 8:30 and from 9:00 to 9:30 Eastern Standard Time, on 350 meters [857 kHz], signing 2ADD\\".

The \\"X\\" in 2XQ's call sign indicated that the station held an Experimental license. and the broadcasts were soon switched to using this authorization. In the summer of 1921, an article featuring the station noted that not only were the Thursday night concerts continuing, but the station had added Sunday night sermons prepared by Union College President C. A. Richmond. The same article also reported that the station, \\"equipped with the most modern of apparatus\\", had been heard as far away as 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers).\\"Eight-Hour Radiophone Transmission by Union College\\", Wireless Age, July 1921, page 31. The Radio Club designed a portable radio for receiving 2XQ transmissions, and as a publicity stunt, mounted it on a baby carriage that was wheeled around town to show off its capabilities. The invention was promoted as \\"a great pacifier for a younger generation\\", and received extensive national publicity.A Wireless Baby Carriage, Wireless Age, July 1921, page 33. Broadcasting station WRL (1922-1924) Initially there were no specific standards restricting which radio stations could conduct a broadcasting service, so it was permissible for stations holding an Amateur or Experimental license to make entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, formally established regulations defining a broadcasting station, setting aside two wavelengths ‚Äî 360 meters (833 kHz) for entertainment, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for official weather and other government reports ‚Äî and requiring that broadcasting stations had to hold a Limited Commercial license.\\"Miscellaneous: Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. After the government started actively enforcing this ban, the college temporarily suspended broadcasting. However, after receiving \\"a request to broadcast the daily reports of the bureau of farms and markets\\", the Union College Radio Club decided to apply for one of the new broadcasting station licenses.\\"Radio Club Will Conduct Classes\\", Schenectady Gazette, February 15, 1922, page 20. On March 2, 1922 Union College was issued its first broadcasting license, with the randomly assigned call letters of WRL, authorizing use of the 360 meter entertainment wavelength.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1922, page 4. Limited Commercial license, serial #313, with the call letters WRL, issued March 2, 1922 to Union College in Schenectady, New York for a three month period. An expanded series of broadcasts followed, including vesper services in April, and a series of special transmissions during the College's 126th Commencement exercises in June.\\"Commencement Week Exercises Sent Out\\", The (Canton, Ohio) Sunday Repository, June 11, 1922, page 31. However, the initial enthusiasm for broadcasting soon waned, and the Radio Club's focus returned to experimental work, including two-way shortwave communication across the Atlantic using its Experimental station 2XQ. On November 11, 1922, WRL was used to broadcast a play-by-play recounting of the Union-Hamilton football game. But a report at the time noted that \\"Union has not been active in popular broadcasting this season, the students devoting their efforts to transoceanic tests.\\"\\"Union College Radios Football Game\\", Denver Rocky Mountain News, November 15, 1922, page 13. WRL's last license was allowed to expire on January 25, 1923, and the station was formally deleted from the government list of active stations on December 18, 1924. \\"Carrier current\\" station UBS / UCRS / WRUC (beginning 1941) After the closing of WRL, Union College did not operate a broadcasting station for the next 17 years. The resumption of broadcast activities was the result of the development of a new form of transmission system. In 1936, students at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island developed the first campus-based carrier current radio station, initially called \\"The Brown Network\\". Carrier current stations employed very low powered AM transmitters, with their signals carried over wires, often running through steam tunnels, that linked together various buildings and dormitories. These transmission lines then fed the radio signals into a building's electrical wires, allowing radio receivers located close to the wires to pick up the transmissions.The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946 by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13. Because they were such low power, with their signals most commonly limited to a college campus plus the immediately adjoining neighborhoods, carrier current stations did not require a license from the Federal Communications Commission or qualify for officially assigned call letters. The \\"carrier current\\" innovation soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. In the fall of 1941, the Union College Radio Club founded its own carrier current station, transmitting on the AM band at 640 kHz,This frequency was chosen because it was free from interference from standard broadcasting stations. During the daytime the closest broadcasting station was a small one located in Columbus, Ohio, while at night the nearest was in Los Angeles, California. which went into operation on September 22, 1941 with College President Fox as the debut's featured speaker. The new station informally adopted the identifier \\"UBS\\" (for \\"Union Broadcasting System\\"), and initially provided service to just the North Campus and the Kappa Alpha fraternity, although this was later expanded to campus-wide. The Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) had been formed in February 1940, to coordinate activities between individual colleges and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward college students, and the Union College Radio Club became a member of IBS on December 28, 1941.Bloch, pages 102-103. In 1939, the Union College Radio Workshop was formed to provide students with \\"practical radio experience\\". Initially the group worked in conjunction with General Electric, gaining experience in radio programming production at that company's experimental FM station, W2XOY, and its shortwave stations, WGEO and WGEA. In mid-1942 the Radio Workshop group merged with the Radio Club, forming the Union College Radio Society. Reflecting this change, the carrier current station now became known as the \\"U.C.R.S. Network\\", boasting a staff of twenty-five students, with studios located in the college's Electrical Engineering building.\\"Union College Workshop Merges with Radio Club\\", Radio-Craft, June 1942, page 584. In early 1947, as a result of a contest, the station's identification was changed to \\"WRUC\\", standing for \\"Radio Union College\\". In 1948, the normal operating schedule was daily from 7 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., and the station was described as an \\"educational experience in the operation of a model broadcast station\\" that also provided \\"for all students the programs they wish to hear\\".\\"Union College Radio Station Offers Students Training in Various Phases of Broadcasting\\", Schenectady Gazette, May 20, 1948, page 22. By 1963, WRUC had fallen silent, with its equipment in disrepair. Restoring operations was taken on as a project by Richard Ferguson and Jeffrey Hedquist, and after being revived it was again operated as a commercial station, eventually programming a high-energy Top 40 format similar to WABC in New York City. Operating hours were expanded to 18 hours a day. In the summer of 1966, a telephone line was used to transmit the programs to nearby Skidmore College, where for a time a second carrier current facility rebroadcast the programs for that campus.\\"Big Booming Sound: WRUC in the Sixties\\" (union.edu) Priority status WRUC refers to itself as \\"The First Station In The Nation\\", and this slogan has been consistently adopted by Union College's various broadcasting endeavors.In October 1950, carrier current station WRUC marked \\"its 30th anniversary of regular broadcasting\\" (\\"Union Radio Station Will Mark 30th Year\\", Schenectady Gazette, October 7, 1950, page 6), and, in October 1980, WRUC (FM) \\"celebrated its 60th birthday\\". (\\"College Had First Radio?\\" (UPI), Reading Eagle, October 15, 1980, page 39). Union College's claim of priority was made as early as 1922, initially for its broadcasting station, WRL. At this time KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which began broadcasting under the Special Amateur call sign of 8ZZ on November 2, 1920, was widely said to be \\"the first broadcasting station\\". WRL supporters countered that WRL's predecessor station, 2ADD, was \\"the first one to regularly broadcast musical programs\\",\\"Union College Claims First Broadcasting\\", Radio World, June 10, 1922, page 28. The original article, \\"Union College Radio Set Increased in Range\\" by Lewis B. Sebring, Jr., Union College '23, appeared on page 6 of Part 2 of the May 14, 1922 issue of the New York Tribune. and because 2ADD's October 14, 1920 start was three weeks prior to KDKA's, therefore WRL should be considered the true pioneer broadcaster. WRL ceased operations in 1924, so WRUC's current primacy claim requires stringing together a series of subsequent Union College broadcasting operations, starting on the AM and ending on the FM band, that begins with a standard amateur station (2ADD, 1920), followed by an Experimental station (2XQ, 1921), an AM broadcasting station (WRL, 1922-1924), then ‚Äî after a 17-year gap when there was no organized broadcasting conducted at the College ‚Äî an unlicensed commercial AM carrier current facility (UBS / UCRS / WRUC (beginning 1941)), and finally, beginning in 1975, a licensed non-commercial FM station, now with WRUC call letters officially assigned by the FCC. The existence of the 1924-1941 gap, plus the need to combine several different broadcasting operations, makes the assertion that WRUC (FM) is a direct continuation of 2ADD problematical. In a review titled \\"Broadcasting's Oldest Stations\\", which appeared in the Winter 1977 issue of the Journal of Broadcasting, authors Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross listed WRUC as one of the stations that they had quickly eliminated from consideration, including it in a group that didn't meet \\"enough of the requirements to be serious claimants within the bounds of this discussion\\"., Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1977, page 62. Although a specific reason for eliminating WRUC was not stated, one of their criteria was \\"a continuous patterned program service\\", which Union College did not meet because of the 17 year period, from the shutdown of broadcasting station WRL in 1924 until the establishment of carrier current station \\"UBS\\" in 1941, when no organized broadcasting was being conducted. Moreover, even in 1922 there were a number of stations in the United States with traditions that their broadcasting histories predated both WRL and KDKA. Charles \\"Doc\\" Herrold, in San Jose, California, began test transmissions in 1909, which were followed by weekly concerts beginning in 1912.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27. Herrold's broadcasts were suspended due to the World War I prohibition of civilian radio stations, and he did not return to the airwaves until May 1921.\\"Radio School Sends Jazz Music via Air\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, May 3, 1921, page 4. His experimental station was relicensed in December 1921 as KQW, which later moved to San Francisco and changed its call letters to KCBS in 1949. Program schedules for KQW appearing in 1925 included the slogan \\"Pioneer Broadcasting Station of the World\\",KQW schedule San Jose Evening News, December 12, 1925, page 2. and in 2009 KCBS celebrated its 100th birthday with a yearlong series of events throughout the Bay Area, including the public dedication of a plaque commemorating the \\"Centennial Celebration of the World's First Broadcasting Station\\". Around April 1920 the \\"California Theater Station\\" in San Francisco, originally under an Experimental license as 6XC, inaugurated a wide-ranging selection of daily broadcasts. The next year inventor Lee de Forest wrote that this was the \\"first radio-telephone station devoted solely\\" to broadcasting to the public.\\"'Broadcasting' News by Radiotelephone\\" (letter from Lee de Forest), Electrical World, April 23, 1921, page 936. The station was relicensed as KZY late in 1921, then deleted in early 1923. Beginning in August 1920, the Detroit News began daily broadcasts under an Amateur license as 8MK, highlighted by election returns broadcast on August 31, 1920.\\"The News Radiophone to Give Vote Results\\", Detroit News, August 31, 1920, pages 1-2. In 1921 the newspaper received a broadcasting license, as WBL, which a few months later changed to its current call letters, WWJ. Among educational institutions, Grove City College in Grove City, Pennsylvania began regular radio concerts in March 1920.\\"Grove City\\", The (Greenville, Pennsylvania) Evening Record, March 25, 1920, page 1: \\"Concerts by a phonograph are being recorded nightly at the wireless telephone station of the college operated by Dr. Herbert Harmon, head of the department of physics of the school.\\" In 1922 the College received a broadcasting license, WSAJ, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 1970, six months before WRUC.\\"Rotarians relive 50 years of broadcasting: Grove City College claims to be first on the air\\", New Castle (Pennsylvania) News, April 28, 1970, page 2. The AM broadcasting station was deleted in 2006, however, the College continues to operate WSAJ-FM. In addition, the Radio Club at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania broadcast a series of dance music broadcasts in May 1920.\\"Music For Dancing Conveyed by Radio\\", (Portland) Oregonian, May 4, 1920, page 1. Carnegie established its own carrier current station, \\"WRCT\\", in 1949, and added an FM station with the same call letters in 1974.

Lovecraft Encyclopedia suggests that the theme of \\"Ex Oblivione\\"‚Äîthat nothingness is preferable to life‚Äîwas derived from Lovecraft's reading the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Lovecraft expressed similar sentiments in non-fiction work at the time, writing in In Defense of Dagon, \\"There is nothing better than oblivion, since in oblivion there is no wish unfulfilled.\\" Synopsis It is written in first person and tells of the dreams of a presumably dying man. In his dreams, the man is walking through a valley and encounters a vine-covered wall with a locked bronze gate therein. He longs to know what lies beyond the gate. Then one night, the man dreams of the dream-city Zakarion, in which he finds a yellowed papyrus written by wise dream-sages who exist only within the dream world. The papyrus tells of the gate, with varying accounts of what lies beyond: some of the dream-sages tell of immense wonders, while others tell of horror and disappointment. Despite this lack of unanimity, the man still wishes to see for himself, even knowing that whichever of these is true, there will be no return. Thus he reads further into the papyrus and learns of a drug which will unlock the gate. The next night he swallows the drug and returns to the gate which is now ajar, but upon entering, he discovers that indeed both accounts within the papyrus are in a sense true: beyond is the wonderment of forever being free from the pain of the real world and the happy surprise that nothing lies beyond the gate but the infinite void that is death.

The story was prepared for publication by Miske, who filled in the story surrounding the description of the dream. In places, the letter and published story are identical to Lovecraft's style. It was first published in Bizarre magazine on January 1941.from H.P Lovecraft archive Plot Morgan, the protagonist, is an illiterate man. One evening, Morgan is sitting alone and suddenly feels compelled to start writing. Despite his illiteracy, he records the dream of Howard Phillips, another man. In Morgan's writing, Phillips says that he fell asleep on November 24, 1927 and has never reawakened. The dream's setting takes place in a strange marshland. Phillips explores the marsh's cliff side, noting the eerie and mouth-like caves dotting the plateau. Eventually, Phillips encounters a set of railway tracks. On these tracks he finds \\"a yellow, vestibuled car numbered 1852‚Äîof a plain, double-trucked type common from 1900 to 1910.\\" This car is able to start and he climbs aboard, searching for a light switch so that he can see better. He hears a noise behind him, and, turning to look, sees two men (assumed to be the motorman and conductor) approach him. The first man lifts his head to the sky, sniffs, and howls, while the second drops to all fours and charges toward the Phillips and the car. Phillips immediately flees out of the car until he is too tired to continue. Phillips reveals that the reason for his terror was not \\"because the conductor had dropped on all fours, but because the face of the motorman was a mere white cone tapering to one blood-red-tentacle...\\" Phillips is aware that it is a dream, but is unable to wake up. During the day, he travels the strange land, and each night, is brought back to the place with the train car. He always alerts the howling beast to his presence, and always flees from it.

The character is played by Ming-Na Wen. Originally, Deb Chen entered the series midway through Season 1 as a medical student. Toward the end of that season, Chen decided she was ill-suited to a career in medical practice and would prefer to pursue a career in research. The character was then absent for more than four years, returning in mid- Season 6 as Dr. Jing-Mei Chen. After five years, Dr. Chen departed once again in the 11th season. Ming-Na's addition into the main cast opening credits was in the 10th episode of season 6 and her removal was in the 10th episode of season 11.  Season 1 and early life at County  She experiences several difficult transitions in her years at County General Hospital. As mentioned, she suffers a crisis of career early in her medical studies. She arrives in the middle of season one as an eager young medical student ready to learn, only to quit near the end of the season after almost killing a man by trying to insert a central line into his chest. At that time, she decides that she was better suited to medical research than to working directly with patients after seeing and growing to understand that she was only interested in the science of medicine and not the direct application of it on the people that are affected by disease or the effects of trauma on the body. She leaves County and does not continue her medical training. She was also revealed to have been very wealthy (although not as wealthy as John Carter) early in her appearances, since both of her parents were doctors; her mother (played by actress Kieu Chinh, who also played her mother in the movie The Joy Luck Club) was chief of surgery at another hospital. In her first appearance, she was shown to be intimidated by John because he arrived earlier and supposedly wiser and more skilled than she, but this was quickly dispelled when it was shown that he was the source of pranking and joke making for most of the ER staff. With the encouragement of Nurse Haleh Adams, she ends up playing a prank on John; Nurse Adams does this after seeing his initial treatment of Deb.  Season 6  She returns to County General in the Season 6 episode \\"Family Matters\\" as a third year resident, after her wealthy parents bought her way back into County with a large donation to the hospital. Upon her return she expresses preference at using her Chinese name \\"Jing-Mei\\", although John Carter continues to affectionately call her \\"Deb\\". She and Carter resume their friendship despite not having seen or spoken with each other in 5 years. In this episode, it is revealed that four months after she quit, she was inspired to return to medicine after saving a man's life on a subway. She then realized that she had a talent for medicine, and her erstwhile rival John Carter was happy to see her back. They continue their rivalry for a while before finally learning how to work with each other. Chen also supported Carter as he recovered from the same near-fatal stabbing that had led to the death of talented medical student Lucy Knight, and was part of the group who confronted him about his drug addiction and successfully convinced him to attend a rehab facility in Atlanta. During this season she showed signs of being attracted to Dr. Dave Malucci. He reciprocated, and the possibility of a romance was briefly explored. However, this changed with the introduction of a male ICU Nurse introduced later in the season as another possible romantic interest.  Season 7  In Season 7, Jing-Mei reveals to Dr. Kerry Weaver that she is pregnant with Nurse Frank Bacon's child, when Kerry informs her that she is a candidate for Chief Resident next year. She gives birth to a baby boy on Christmas Eve, accompanied by her longtime friend John Carter. After considering the challenges of being a doctor and a single mother, and also realizing she would not get much support from her family because her son is biracial, she subsequently gives the child up for adoption. At the end of the season, both she and Carter apply for Chief Resident, but her application is declined due to her time off for maternity leave. She appeals the decision and is promoted to Chief Resident in Season 8. During this season it was shown that her attraction to Dave Malucci had disappeared and in fact, their relationship had turned somewhat adversarial.  Season 8  During the early part of Season 8, Jing-Mei is having a hard time as an authority figure in the ER. Weaver is pressuring her about being indecisive. In the episode \\"The Longer You Stay\\", Jing-Mei and Dr. Dave Malucci make a hasty decision to perform a procedure before checking all necessary tests, ultimately leading to the death of a patient who is later found to have symptoms associated with Marfan syndrome. Because of this mistake, and her history as a medical student, the Risk Management staff, Dr. Robert Romano and Dr. Weaver agree to have her resign as Chief Resident; in addition, Weaver fires Malucci. The board determines that because of her maternity leave, she did not have Attending status at the time of the incident and was therefore not authorized to make the decision for the procedure. Weaver, the Attending on shift, was off campus at the time and did not answer her pages, meaning that the procedure was unauthorized. As a result, Jing-Mei quits. After the holidays, Jing-Mei returns to County to speak to Romano about getting her job back. She claims to have evidence that Weaver was not wearing her pager at the time of the incident and had, in fact, left it in a restaurant bathroom. In order to stave off lawsuits and accusations of professional negligence on Weaver's part, the hospital re-hires Jing-Mei as a full-time Attending, much to Weaver's dismay. Their relationship afterward is awkward at best, but reaches an accord after both parties impress the other with their professionalism and the need to work as comrades while under pressure from County's chaotic environment. At the end of Season 8, Jing-Mei begins working with the new Dr. Greg Pratt, who constantly flirts with her, to a mix of condescension and amusement. They are forced to work with each other when the ER is locked down due to a supposed smallpox outbreak.  Season 9  In the season premiere episode of Season 9, while under quarantine for Smallpox which was actually revealed to be Monkeypox, she and Abby Lockhart, John Carter, Gregory Pratt, and a homeless patient spend 2 weeks socializing at a shut down Chicago County General. In this Season, Jing-Mei and Pratt start a relationship; however, it begins to fizzle out when Pratt shows he isn't truly serious about the relationship, while Chen is constantly critical of him, and they call it quits in Season 10. During season 9, she strikes a closer friendship with both Susan Lewis and Abby Lockhart who are seen hanging out more often. In this season, we begin to see Jing Mei becoming a less utilized character in the series and that most of her storylines revolve around her romantic relationship with Dr. Gregory Pratt; this continues until her final appearance on the show.  Season 10  In season 10, Jing-Mei and Greg Pratt break up very early in the season when it becomes clear she doesn't particularly like him and he has no interest in \\"proving himself\\" to her. She later flies to China, where her mother died in a car accident, leaving her to care for her ailing father. In succeeding episodes, she is seen struggling with her father's increasing emotional instability and violent outbursts. At one point Chen's father hits her, inflicting a black eye. While she and Greg's post-breakup ties are strained (in one episode, Jing-Mei tells Sam Taggart she regrets that she missed out on a possible relationship with Luka Kovac and went in \\"another direction\\", and later on she pointedly assigns interesting parts of a complex case to a resident who is less experienced and qualified than Pratt, who knows exactly what she's doing but takes it in stride), by the season finale, Chen and Pratt have gotten back on decent terms with each other to the point where she is in a car with Pratt driving and his patient Elgin sitting in the back. Pratt angers another driver, who opens fire on their car. In the midst of the chaos the episode fades to black.  Season 11 and departure  While trying to avoid the shooting, the car spins out of control and crashes into the Chicago River, with Jing-Mei shot in the leg and Elgin shot in the neck. Jing- Mei and Greg Pratt require major surgery, and Elgin dies while receiving emergency care. Later in Season 11, an overwhelmed Jing-Mei/Deb quits County after Dr. Susan Lewis, the newly appointed chief of emergency medicine, refuses her request for leave to care for her father on Christmas Eve. Dr. Pratt discovers that Chen's father is constantly asking for her to help him commit suicide and in her bewildered state she considers listening to her father's wishes and giving him a lethal dose of potassium or Ativan to kill him. She eventually fulfills this wish and when she does so, he almost immediately dies. Pratt covers for her by telling the paramedics that Chen's father had died in his sleep. Chen returns to China to bury her father and lets Greg know she has no plans to return to the U.S. anytime soon. Chen did not return to the series after this, and was never mentioned again by any of the other characters.  Season 15  During the 15th and final season of ER, at the end of the episode The Book of Abby, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \\"Chen\\" can be seen.

He was the founder of the modern system of physical education and medical-pedagogical control in physical training, one of founders of theoretical anatomy. Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health in St. Petersburg is named after him. Unity and integrity of all organs in human body was the basis of Peter Lesgaft system of the pointed exercises for both physical development and intellectual, moral and aesthetic education. Outdoor games were his favorite means in both physical development and formation of character of a child.  Biography  Peter Lesgaft was born on 21 September 1837 in Sankt- Petersburg, the third son of a jeweler of German descent. In 1861 he graduated from Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg and remained there as a teacher of anatomy. In 1869 he became a professor at the University of Kazan, but soon was barred from teaching for his outspoken criticism of the unscientific methods used. In 1872 he became consultant on therapeutic gymnastics in the private practice of Dr. Berglindt. In 1872-1874 he supervised a group of Russian women for the first time allowed to employment in the Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy. He also became known for publication of a descriptive history of sport in Europe and ancient Greece and an article on naturalistic gymnastics. As a result, he was put in charge of the physical training of military cadets. In 1875, he was sponsored by the Russian Military Ministry to spend two summers in Western Europe, studying the systems of physical education. During that time he visited 26 cities in 13 European countries. He carefully studied British system visiting English public schools, the Central Army Gymnastics School at Aldershot, the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and Oxford University. In 1877, he published ‚Äò‚ÄòRelationship of Anatomy to Physical Education and ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Major Purpose of Physical Education in Schools. He was able to organizing courses for physical education instructors for the military academies ‚Äî until then non-existent. In 1893 Peter Lesgaft organized Biological laboratory which in 1918 was transformed into P.F.Lesgaft Institute of Natural Science.

In other words, every energy level is at least doubly degenerate if it has half-integer spin. The law is named for the Dutch physicist H. A. Kramers. In theoretical physics, the time reversal symmetry is the symmetry of physical laws under a time reversal transformation: : T: t \\\\mapsto -t. If the Hamiltonian operator commutes with the time-reversal operator, that is :[H,T]=0, then for every energy eigenstate n\\\\rangle, the time reversed state Tn\\\\rangle is also an eigenstate with the same energy. Of course, this time reversed state might be identical to the original state, but that is not possible in a half-integer spin system since time reversal reverses all angular momenta, and reversing a half-integer spin cannot yield the same state (the magnetic quantum number is never zero). For instance, the energy levels of a system with an odd total number of fermions (such as electrons, protons and neutrons) remain at least doubly degenerate in the presence of purely electric fields (i.e. no magnetic fields). It was first discovered in 1930 by H. A. Kramers as a consequence of the Breit equation. As shown by Eugene Wigner in 1932,E. Wigner, √úber die Operation der Zeitumkehr in der Quantenmechanik, Nachr. Akad. Ges. Wiss.

The theorem is valid for any configuration of static or time-varying electric fields. For example: the hydrogen (H) atom contains one proton and one electron, so that the Kramers theorem does not apply. The lowest (hyperfine) energy level of H is nondegenerate. The deuterium (D) isotope on the other hand contains an extra neutron, so that the total number of fermions is three, and the theorem does apply. The ground state of D contains two hyperfine components, which are twofold and fourfold degenerate.

Typically these drivers produce only the frequency range relevant to electric guitars, which is similar to a regular woofer type driver, which is approximately 75 Hz ‚Äî 5 kHz, or for electric bass speakers, down to 41 Hz for regular four-string basses or down to about 30 Hz for five-string instruments. The cones of these drivers typically range in size from 6.5 in to 15 in with 10 and 12 in models being the most popular for electric guitar and electric bass combo amps and speaker cabinets. As with all loudspeaker drivers, the magnets are usually made from Alnico, ceramic, or, to reduce weight on more expensive models, neodymium. Higher quality Alnico magnets are reserved for more expensive models. Well-known guitar speaker manufacturers include Jensen, Celestion, Eminence, Electro-Voice, JBL, Peavey, and Vox. Small practice amps often have 6.5 or 8 speakers. Combination (or \\"combo\\") amplifier cabinets often have one or more 10 and 12 speakers. The largest speaker \\"stacks\\", used in stadium concerts, have eight 10 or 12 in speakers. Bass amplifier speaker cabinets for the bass guitar also often use one or more 10 or 12 in speakers (both 2x10 in and 4x10 in cabinets are popular; in addition, bass cabinets are more likely than electric guitar cabinets to use 15 in speakers. Guitar speakers are designed differently from hi-fi speakers intended for in-home listening to pre-recorded music. Whereas hi-fi speakers are meant to provide as little coloration of the source signal as possible, guitar speakers are often designed to add some type of tonal coloration to the sound. Cabinet Kustom 200 bass amp ‚Äì amp head and speakers, 100 watts RMS, two channels, on top of a speaker cabinet with two 15\\" speakers, 1971 A guitar speaker cabinet is typically a wooden box that contains one or more guitar speakers. The smallest guitar cabinets have one 6.5\\" or 8\\" speaker; these are usually practice amplifier units designed for private practice. Some cabinets designed for rehearsals and small- to mid-size venues contain two 10\\" or 12\\" speakers. Another popular format is four 10\\" or four 12\\" speakers. Some performers use two 4x10\\" or 4x12\\" cabinets. The largest guitar speaker cabinets have eight 10\\" or 12\\" speakers. A 4x12\\" (\\"four by twelve\\") is a guitar speaker cabinet containing four 12\\" speakers. Less commonly, some bass amp cabinets have multiple 8\\" speakers (e.g., the 8x8\\" cabinet). Cabinets with mixed-size speakers are less common, but they are used (e.g., a bass amplifier cabinet with a 15\\" loudspeaker for lower frequencies and a smaller speaker for mid- to high-range frequencies. A cabinet is usually mono, but may have two inputs for a \\"stereo\\" amplifier. Two speakers in a cabinet may be wired in parallel (lowering the impedance) or in series (increasing the impedance). Larger multiples will usually be series/parallel to maintain an impedance of 4 to 8 ohms. Many cabinets contain parallel input/outputs on the rear panel, so that one speaker cab can be plugged into the amp head, and then a second cabinet can be plugged into the first cabinet; as this \\"daisy-chaining\\" approach is wired in parallel, plugging in a second cabinet lowers the impedance seen by the amplifier. Cabinets typically have an impedance rating printed on the rear panel, such as \\"8 ohm minimum\\" or \\"4 ohms minimum\\". These warnings mean that the user should not connect an amplifier requiring a higher impedance; tube amps in particular are designed to work with speakers having some particular impedance. Since speaker impedances as seen by the amplifier vary with frequency, with voice coil construction, and with the cabinet's acoustical loading (which also varies with frequency) there can be no exact match under all conditions. When users daisy-chain a second cabinet with paralled speakers, they must ensure the amplifier can handle the lower impedance it will see. Bass guitar cabinets may include a single speaker (typically 12\\" or 15\\"), multiple speakers of the same type (common formats include 2x10\\", 4x10\\" and 8x10\\"). Some bass cabinets use multiple different- sized speakers, such as a mixture of 12\\" and 15\\" speakers. In rare cases, some large bass cabinets (known as \\"bass bins\\") incorporate folded horns to boost the bass response. Bass amp cabinets may have a horn or tweeter built into a speaker cabinet which contains one or more woofer drivers. When a cabinet includes such a horn, the enclosure may also have an attenuator knob, for turning the horn volume up or down. Some more expensive bass cabinets with a woofer/horn approach may have additional features, such as circuitry to protect the speakers or horn from overloads or a biamplification option. Biamplification enables a bassist to use a crossover circuit to split their bass signal into two: a low frequency signal and a high frequency signal, and then route the low and high frequencies into two power amplifiers, each of which send their powered signal to different speaker enclosures. One power amp (usually of higher power) handles the low frequencies, which are sent the larger drivers (at lower frequencies), and a less powerful amp amplifies the high frequencies, which are sent to the horn. For bass players seeking a pure, transparent sound, biamplification may produce a \\"cleaner\\" sound. For bass players in hard rock or heavy metal who are using an overdriven sound, biamplification may be safer for the horn or tweeter; while a clipped, distorted signal can be handled by a heavy-duty woofer, the same clipped signal will come much closer to damaging a horn driver or a tweeter. Biamping allows a bassist to have the \\"dirty\\" overdriven sound through their woofer(s) while keeping the signal sent to the horn clean, thus protecting the horn. At the high onstage volume levels used in large rock and metal concerts, a powerful, overdriven bass signal poses a higher risk of horn damage in non- biamped systems. Often what is referred to as a \\"guitar amp\\" is in fact a combo amplifier: a cabinet with speakers and a built-in amplifier. Combo amplifiers may be referred to by their speaker cabinet configuration plus the word \\"combo\\", so that \\"4x10 combo\\" means a guitar amplifier built into a 4x10\\" speaker cabinet. Since the popular configurations are limited in variety, cabinet configurations are often written abbreviated without ambiguity: For example, 4x10\\" may be written 410, and 112 refers to a single cabinet housing a 12\\" speaker. The speaker cabinets, which hold these drivers can be closed- back or open-back, along with variations such as a semi-open back 4x12 in cabinet, which may have a baffle deflecting two of the four speakers. Closed back cabinets may be acoustic suspension or bass reflex. Bass cabinets are usually closed-back or use a bass reflex port or vent to boost low frequency response. The purpose of the cabinet is match the acoustic impedance seen by the driver to the driver's own electrical/mechanical impedance. Cabinets are best used when they are matched to the driver(s) being used; casual substitution of another driver which can be mounted in a cabinet will only accidentally make changes in a beneficial direction. The sound of the speaker and cabinet is crucial to the sound of the electric guitar, so much so that it needs to be considered part of the instrument's tone. If the clean signal from a guitar amplifier or pre-amplifier is captured directly (i.e., before it is sent to a speaker cabinet) it will very often be rather brittle and thin, with no \\"resonant\\" depth, particularly if the guitar signal is from a string pickup (i.e., the type used in a solid-body electric guitar). Vibration pickups, or microphone pickups, as used in many hollow body electro-acoustic guitars, aren't as strongly affected. The result can sound excessively shrill, scratchy and fizzy, completely different from the smooth tones that listeners hear in recordings or live performances. When driven hard, guitar speakers produce complex behavior, which affects the sound of the instrument. There will be some power compression, several kinds of distortion, even mechanical limiting as one or more drivers approach their physical limits (e.g. cone excursion). A guitar speaker shows a nonlinear frequency response depending on the speaker's load, e.g. the frequency response, and various distortions, at small amplitudes is different from those at large amplitudes. Isolation cabinets and emulation devices A guitar speaker isolation cabinet contains a guitar speaker and one or two microphones in a single- or double-layer soundproofed box. These devices allow the capture of the sound of a guitar amplifier and speaker being played at high levels, while minimizing \\"bleed through\\" between tracks in the mix. These are almost exclusively used in recording studios and during live performances being recorded. As an alternative to the isolation cabinet, there are guitar speaker cabinet emulating circuits or signal processors (also known as direct boxes or preamplifier-DI boxes), allowing the sound of a guitar amplifier to be fed directly into a PA system or recording equipment without the need for a speaker cabinet and microphone. Direct boxes are used more often with electric bass than with electric guitar, because the tone of a guitar amplifier and speaker is often considered to be a key element of an electric guitarist's tone. While DI boxes are used to route an electric bass signal to a mixing board, the audio engineer also often uses a mic set up in front of the bassist's speaker enclosure, to capture the bass player's preamped, equalized signal from the speaker cabinet. The engineer can then use either the DI out signal or the miked cabinet in the live or recording mix, or use a blend of the DI signal and the miked cabinet signal. Digital cabinet emulation is the treatment of a signal with the simulation of the sound of a speaker and a cabinet. It is available in software, \\"stompbox\\" pedals, and in some guitar amps with a \\"cabinet modeling\\" feature. Cabinet emulation is complex, but at its core it is the use of digital equalization which, combined with resonance models that reproduce the frequency response of the mounted speaker as well as the internal reflections and standing waves of the cabinet. Cabinet emulators typically offer the user a range of commonly-used presets (e.g., different sizes of speaker cabinet, from small combo amps to large 8x10\\" \\"stacks\\" and different types or styles of speaker or cabinet, for traditional, blues, metal and other genres). Some cabinet emulator systems also allow the user to select the type of miking or the position of the microphones (e.g., front miking, rear miking, etc.). There is debate about how successful this level of emulation is or can be from a musical perspective. Technically, with enough funding and effort, it is possible to emulate a particular speaker/cabinet combination, but so many factors also affect the sound (eg, the room in which the speaker/cabinet is being used, the amplfier driving it, ...) that musical success for a particular observer may be justly debated.

It is owned by Denver-based Amigo Multimedia, Inc. History The station was originally signed on by E. O. Smith as KZON, before trying a Spanish format and becoming KRDS in 1963. The station operated as \\"Cards Country\\" with a moderately popular country music format prior to adopting a news/talk format in the early 1970s. It changed to a Christian talk and music format in 1975. It was simulcast on KRDS-FM 105.3 Wickenburg in the 1990s. This station is now KHOV- FM.http://www.laradio.com/q&a4q-98.htm; In 1997, the station changed call letters to KMYL. KMYL aired the Music of Your Life format, and later changed to \\"NBC 1190\\", as a variety talk station (later an infomercial and brokered talk station) which ran NBC Radio News at the top of the hour. La Buena Onda 1190 KNUV La Buena Onda logo used until July 31, 2008 sign off The format was changed in August 2005 when the station was acquired by a startup group, New Radio Venture, which brought a Spanish-language news/talk format targeting the large Spanish-speaking immigrant population in the Phoenix area. At the same time, NRV bought a Denver station, which it christened KNRV, and gave it an identical format. The newly renamed KNUV became known as \\"La Buena Onda\\" (The Good Wave). At the peak of the first Buena Onda era, KNUV had Lily Antonini Latina reporter with breaking news every half and hour and with live reports and interviews. The station also was the English-language radio home of the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA. On November 9, 2007, KNUV protested the police description of the ‚ÄúChandler Rapist‚Äù as a ‚ÄúHispanic,‚Äù claiming it amounts to racial profiling. The man, believed to be responsible for six attacks on teenage girls starting in June 2006 was described as Hispanic, 28 to 40 years old, 5 feet 6 inches tall, muscular, with a mustache and black hair. Radio station 1190AM was the first hisp√°nic news media to promote and follow up the story Hispanics Protest Rapist Description - Phoenix News Story - KPHO Phoenix KNUV and KNRV signed off on July 31, 2008.

KNUV assumed the flagship station designation for Nova M, which later became On Second Thought before ceasing operations entirely by the spring of 2009. KPHX adopted The Lounge Sound music radio format at that time, which itself lasted only until July 2009, when KPHX returned to the progressive talk format, with significant involvement from Dr. Mike Newcomb, a key player in that format on each of the stations on which it has been broadcast in the Phoenix market dating back to 2004.

All of the land on the island is owned by the City of Boston but the island is under the jurisdiction of Quincy, Massachusetts.Irons, Meghan E.; Dungca, Nicole, \\"Abrupt closing of Long Island Bridge was slow to arrive\\", The Boston Globe, December 14, 2014 It is also part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. The causeway to Moon Island did not exist before the late 1870s and there was no bridge across Western Way to Long Island until the construction of the Long Island Viaduct in 1951. This bridge was closed October 8, 2014.Rushed closing of Long Island bridge takes a human toll The sand spit from Thompson Island to Squaw Rock on Squantum was a clam bar until the sewage outflow from Moon Island backed up into the local waters. Native Americans summered in this area for thousands of years and consumed the prevalent mollusks. Another two bars pointed from Moon Island toward Squantum, following the general path of the new causeway. In early years, the land where UMass Boston and the Kennedy Memorial are located was open water. The area around Marina Bay was salt marsh leaving a much wider mouth to the Neponset River. In Colonial times, Moon Island was recorded as having of land mass that was used as pasture. This land was connected at very low tides by two sand bars. The proper approach to this island in the late 19th century was from the Quincy Bay side. There was a hill on the northerly side. Early inhabitants called the island, \\"Munning's Moone,\\" or \\"Mennen's Moon,\\" and is also recorded as \\"Moon Island\\" and \\"Moon Head\\". Long Island, together with Moon Island, showing island iconography. Today, Moon Island consists of and is connected to Squantum by a two-lane roadway over the causeway. Moon Island is owned by the City of Boston and is no longer available for public access or use. As with many of the other islands in Boston Harbor, municipal and federal authorities have obtained ownership of Boston Harbor islands over the centuries. Most have never returned to private ownership or use. Access to the causeway leading to Moon Island is controlled by police at a guardhouse at its southern end, and permission to enter the island must be obtained in advance since it is a restricted area.  History  Moon Island and its causeway as seen from Squantum In colonial times, the island was known as Manning's Moone, and was mainly used for grazing and farming. On June 2, 1641, by order of the General Court of Elections in Boston, Moon Island came under the jurisdiction of the Town of Dorchester. In 1659, Moon Island was valued at twenty-eight pounds. Dorchester town records for show of April 3, 1638s an allotment of land being made to James Priest and Robert Elwell on \\"Manning's Moone\\"; and, according to the History of the Town of Dorchester, Capt. John Holland's will left \\"Munning's Moone\\" to his oldest son in 1652. The island was eventually sold to Henry Ashhurst. During 1775, armed British barges chased a Colonial raiding party from Long Island to Dorchester. One American soldier was killed on Moon Island. There is a 1776 reference to a Moon Island Redoubt fortification that was authorized. However, there is no evidence that it ever had been constructed. In 1850, Boston's first comprehensive public report blamed poor sanitary conditions for the high mortality rates among immigrants. The report recommended collecting the sewage instead of allowing it to drain into Boston Harbor. At this time, Boston's sewage was discharged into drains along the streets of Boston directly from residences and buildings. These drains discharged directly into local streams, bays, and from docks, polluting the harbor waters, poisoning the air, and leaving effluent on mud flats that surrounded Boston. On warm summer days, the odors from these flats became unbearable. Affluent Bostonians left Boston during the summer months for their summer residences on the North Shore. In 1878, the Massachusetts State Legislature approved the construction of the Boston Main Drainage System, which was supposed to handle the sewage from 18 cities and towns by pumping it to Moon Island for storage and release into Quincy Bay on the outgoing tides. The City of Boston began construction of a large diameter brick sewer conduit from Old Harbor Point (Columbia Point) under Dorchester Bay to Squantum and out to Moon Island under a causeway. The shaft is below ground and a mile and a half in length. It took 5 million bricks and of cement to complete the pipe. There is a brick building located at the end of the University of Massachusetts Boston campus facing Squantum. This is the location of the sewer system's pump house, known as the Calf Pasture Pumping Station Complex, which was named for the marshy area known as the Dorchester Calf Pasture at that time. Initially, this area was a long narrow land-filled peninsula but has been subsequently expanded many times to accommodate development. Exiting the tunnel, the sewage was pumped through Squantum Neck and reached holding tanks on Moon Island through another conduit placed under the embankment from Squantum to Moon Island. The sand and gravel needed to complete this project was stripped from Half Moon Island, a crescent-shaped island that was located near the mouth of Black's Creek in Quincy Bay. Four huge cut-granite storage tanks with a capacity were built by the Cape Ann Granite Company to handle the sewage. These vats were formed by digging out the northern section of the hill and cementing and bricking the sides of the excavation. This reservoir was divided into four compartments, each with inlets and four outlets. The tanks were 900 by and deep. The bottoms were seven feet thick and were grooved to ease the removal of sludge. At one end was a gatehouse. The tank outlets were connected with a power pump and a turbine that was used to open the gates of the outflow pipe. The diameter outflow conduit extended into the harbor from the northern end of Moon Island. The Sewage Plant was completed in 1884 at a cost of $6-million. The original operating plan was to collect the raw sewage in the four storage tanks during times of high water and, then, two hours after the start of ebb tide, the sewage would be discharged into the harbor. This allowed approximately four hours until slack water. The total outflow time was three to four hours per cycle or six to eight hours per 24-hour period. Boston Harbor normally has two tide and current cycles each day. The expectation was that the effluent would flow between Long and Rainsford Islands, through a small gut between Gallops and Georges Island, then out through Black Rock Channel and Nantasket Roads. As time passed, the population of Boston expanded and additional communities were added to the system. The discharge of sewage at Moon Island required longer and longer outflow periods. The situation worsened until the incoming tides distributed the unprocessed sewage throughout the sand flats and beaches of Boston Harbor and Quincy Bay. In 1889, The Metropolitan Sewerage District (MSD) was formed to build one of the first regional sewer systems in the United States. The system continued to expand through the early 20th century. The Moon Island system provided no treatment capability. It merely collected waste water and effluent, and pumped it out into Boston Harbor. During 1892, a garbage reclaiming plant was established on Moon Island. The plant was moved to Spectacle Island during 1912. By 1919, severe pollution from the Moon Island sewage outflow caused the closing of many of the clam beds and beaches in Boston Harbor and Quincy Bay. Also during this year, the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) took over control of the Moon Island/Squantum Sewer System from the MSD. In 1933, the pollution of Boston Harbor worsened to the point that all clams taken in the area required purification processing before sale or consumption. Pollution on the Boston and Quincy beaches worsened. In 1939, a legislature committee found that Quincy Bay and Hingham Harbor were \\"revolting\\" and \\"in violation of all public health requirements.\\" Both Boston and Quincy beaches have been closed since 1890. More than of raw sewage were being dumped into Boston Harbor daily. The following year, Massachusetts State planners recommended the construction of sewage treatment plants at Moon Island, Deer Island, and Nut Island in Quincy. On August 4, 1951, then Secretary of Labor, Maurice J. Tobin, dedicated the two-lane steel bridge from Moon Head to Long Island. In 1959, The Boston Fire Department constructed a fire-fighting training facility at the northern end of Moon Island. A concrete building was designed and built to simulate the various roof designs and window shapes found in the City of Boston. In 1960, the Boston Police Department established an outdoor pistol range on the southern side of Moon Island. This facility is now jointly used by the Boston and Quincy Police Departments. A cache of stone blades were found on a Squantum beach in 1961. These artifacts belonged to the early Indians who lived in the Squantum area. The Moon Island sewage facility was still operating in 1967, pumping about a million gallons of sewage into Boston Harbor. 15‚Äì20% of the sludge that was discharged with the outgoing tides returned on the next incoming tide. The result was that Boston Harbor and Quincy Bay became severely polluted. With the opening of the Deer Island sewage treatment plant in 1968, the discharge of sewage from the Moon Island facility was put on emergency standby status and the flow of the sewage to Moon Island was diverted to Deer Island. The Squantum Naval Air Station in Squantum was abandoned and in ruins by 1970. Also during this year, the skeleton of a dog was found below a heap of shells in Squantum. The dog's remains were carbon dated to 300 AD. The remains of a few native Indians have also been discovered nearby. The sachem Chickataubut had his summer home at Moswetuset Hummock in the early 17th century. In 1972, federal and state laws mandated primary and secondary treatment for all municipal sewer systems, effectively taking the option for lesser treatment plants away from states. In 1984, due to the extensive pollution on Quincy's beaches, the City of Quincy filed a lawsuit in state court against the MDC. As a result, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) was created to manage the cleanup of Boston Harbor. Judge Troy made a judicial decision that prohibited the attachment of any new buildings or homes to the existing sewer system until a plan was established to solve the sewerage overflow problem in Boston Harbor. In 1985, the MWRA assumed control of all of the MDCs water and sewer systems. Because these systems were below federal standards, a federal court order mandated the construction of a new waste water treatment plant on Deer Island. In 1993, National Guard bulldozers, with little public notice, began clearing the woods on Moon Island for a firing range that was planned to have lights for night shooting. Outraged local Squantum residents feared that the increased shooting on Moon Island would endanger them or even passing boat operators. The Seaside Environmental Alliance claimed the Boston Plan was a ruse, indicating that this expansion would affect the plans for any use of Moon Island by the general public. The public continues to be banned from both Moon and Long Islands. In 1996, the Boston Globe reported that Mayor Tom Menino and MIT engineer Clifford Goudey were planning a program to revitalize the aquaculture system in Boston Harbor and use the great tanks on Moon Island as a fish farm or a temporary home for tuna or lobster.Anand, Geeta, \\"Harbor island studied for fish farm Mayor envisions raising flounder, tuna and lobsters\\" , The Boston Globe, October 13, 1996. Quoting from the article: \\"The Boston mayor and the MIT engineer were talking fish. With the city's skyline in the distance, they stood beside one of four long trenches on Moon Island that may soon be teeming with lobsters, bluefin tuna and summer flounder. For nearly two years, Mayor Thomas M. Menino and MIT engineer Clifford Goudey have shared a dream. Now they are wedded to a plan. Together, they are trying to turn the century-old sewage trenches on the harbor island into one of the largest fish farms in the country. 'This could be the new industry for the city,' the mayor said. 'We have the ocean, we have the reservoirs for the fish, we have what we need to make this work.'\\"Best, Neil A., \\"Preliminary Design of a Recirculating Aquaculture System in Boston Harbor\\" , Masters Thesis, Ocean Engineering, MIT, February 1997. Technical Advisor, Clifford A. Goudey.Marcus, John, \\"Scientists Test Once-Polluted Harbor‚Äôs Crop Potential\\", Los Angeles Times, Sunday, January 11, 1998 The prices of both these fish types vary by season. The plan was to collect and store fish in the tanks and sell the fish at higher prices when they were out of season. Nothing has come of this plan to date. Today, Moon Island remains closed to the general public and is still owned by the City of Boston. With the cessation of sewage discharge, the waters around the island have become a prime fishing resource. However, access is limited to private boat. The lagoon on the northwest of Moon Island formed by the Moon Island causeway, Squantum and Thompson Island has become an anchorage for private boats, providing protection from the boat wakes in Dorchester Bay and Western Way.

The school mascot is the cardinal, and the school colors are red and white. History Established as Olive Springs Consolidated School in 1884, the building consisted of a single room serving grades one through eight. In 1892 the school became part of the Cobb County School System and was housed in the Olive Springs Baptist Church, little is known about the history of the community school until 1919. As a member of a faculty of only three, Robert L. Osborne became the principal of Olive Springs Community School in 1919. Over the next nine years, Osborne worked tirelessly to serve a growing population. In 1928, the school moved from its original location at Olive Springs Baptist Church to Joyner Avenue. As the new school opened on September 10, 1928, it employed ten teachers and served 350 students in grades one through nine. In 1936, recognizing and honoring Osborne's commitment to the community, Olive Springs School was renamed Robert L. Osborne School. In 1938, R. L. Osborne became a fully accredited senior high school. Its first graduating class in 1939 boasted 25 members, 13 boys and 12 girls. As the school moved to its present location on Favor Road in 1962, Mr. Osborne retired. A new school is being constructed for 2020 opening.

Career=Kansas City Royals The Kansas City Royals signed Melido as an undrafted free agent in 1983. He made his major league debut for the Kansas City Royals on September 4, 1987. In that game, P√©rez pitched seven innings of shutout ball for the victory. On December 10, 1987, Melido was traded with Chuck Mount (minors), John Davis and Greg Hibbard to the Chicago White Sox for Floyd Bannister and Dave Cochrane. Chicago White Sox In 4 seasons with the White Sox, Melido appeared in 147 games, starting 106, and pitching 713 innings while compiling a 44-45 record; all the highest cumulative totals he accrued with one team during his career. In his first season at Chicago, Perez started 32 games, posting a 12-10 record with a 3.79 ERA. He finished 6th in the American League Rookie of the Year Award voting. Perez was the White Sox's Opening Day starter in 1990. Later that season, he threw a no-hitter against the New York Yankees in a game shortened to 7 innings by rain. The following year, Major League Baseball revised its definition of a no-hitter, stating that a pitcher must complete at least 9 innings to achieve the feat, retroactively disallowing Perez's and 35 other shortened no-hitters, as well as the Yankees' Andy Hawkins' no-hitter against the White Sox earlier that year. On January 10, 1992, Melido was traded by the Chicago White Sox with Domingo Jean and Bob Wickman to the New York Yankees for Steve Sax. New York Yankees In 1992, Melido would see a turn for the better. That year he had his best year statistically, by striking out 218 batters - second in the American League behind Randy Johnson. He also averaged third in the AL with 7.922 strikeout average per 9 innings. He also maintained a 2.87 ERA. His career ended with the Yankees at the end of the 1995 season after a tear in his right throwing elbow. Cleveland Indians In 1997, Melido was invited to the Cleveland Indians spring training. He did not make the cut for the season roster. Post career Melido currently lives in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic with his wife and three children. He earned an estimated $16 million in his nine-year career . He is also known for giving up Manny Ram√≠rez's first career home run. Currently, Perez is the mayor of San Gregorio de Nigua in the Dominican Republic.

The council dealt mostly with religious matters, primarily ecclesiastical disciplinary reform. It also ordered the celebration of annual synods in all the provinces as they had theretofore been in Carthaginiensis alone. These synods would be held at the order of the king on a date determined by him and the metropolitan. The singing of the Psalms was standardised in all the provinces and sanctions were placed on bishops who had relations with noblewomen. The council tried to curb simony by making bishops swear an oath that they had neither paid nor promised to pay for their see before their consecration. If the oath was ignored, the consecration could not take place. Those guilty of simony were exiled for two years, but could retain their sees. This last provision probably signifies that simony was becoming less common already. This small local Council, attended by only 17 bishops, has little significance today except for the beautiful confession of faith which was recited at its opening. The official value of this document consists in the fact that in subsequent centuries it was kept in highest regard and considered a genuine expression of the Trinitarian faith; it is one of the important formulas of doctrine. In fact, hardly anywhere is the reflection of the early Church on the Trinitarian mystery and on Christ expressed with such precision and acumen as in this Creed which sums up the tradition of the earlier Councils and patristic theology of the West.* Sources *Thompson, E.

Porlock means place of the port and Porlock Weir is its harbour. Weir refers to salmon stakes and traps that were situated along the shore. It is a popular visitor attraction. Many cottages date from the 17th century, including the Gibraltar Cottages which have been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building. Like most ports in West Somerset, the harbour is tidal and is home to a small flotilla of yachts and is visited by many more in spring and summer. The port has existed for more than a thousand years. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that in 1052 Harold Godwinson came from Ireland with nine ships and plundered the area and before that in 866 AD it was raided by Danes. In the 18th and 19th centuries coal from South Wales was the main cargo and in World War II pit props cut in local forests were the return cargo. The ketch, Lizzy, was wrecked at Gore Point, near Porlock Weir. The ship, built in Appledore, was spotted in trouble off Lynmouth in a storm in 1854. The ship had lost her masts, and was in very bad condition. A fishing boat was sent out to rescue the crew, as Lynmouth possessed no lifeboat. The boat reached the stricken ketch, rescued the crew and returned to Lynmouth safely. The weather improved, and a fresh crew, with the vessel's skipper attempted to salvage her. They improvised with a scrap of sail, and managed to get safely around Foreland Point. They sailed on all night, only just managing to keep the ship afloat. When they reached Gore Point, a mile from Porlock Weir, the ketch sank in shallow water. The wreck lies submerged off the point.Hesp, P. (1993).Exmoor and West Somerset Coastline. Countryside TV Productions. On 12 January 1899, in a storm, the ten-ton Lynmouth lifeboat was launched, but because of the ferocity of the storm could not put out to sea, and was hauled by men and 20 horses over Countisbury and Porlock Hills to Porlock Weir where the water was less rough. Thirteen seamen were rescued. Porlock Weir harbour, as illustrated by Sydney R.

Symptoms include skin rashes, severe arthritis, and chronic meningitis leading to neurologic damage. It is one of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. NOMID can result from a mutation in the CIAS1 gene (also known as NLRP3 gene), which helps control inflammation. Mutations in this gene also cause familial cold urticaria and Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome. NOMID has been successfully treated with the drug anakinra. This syndrome is also known as the Prieur‚ÄìGriscelli syndrome as it was first described by these authors in 1981.Prieur AM, Griscelli C (1981) Arthropathy with rash, chronic meningitis, eye lesions, and mental retardation. J. Pediat 99:79-83 Signs and symptoms The age of onset is almost always before 3 months of age. Many infants are born preterm (1/3 cases) and dysmature. The babies are frequently small for dates. The placenta may be abnormal with non-specific inflammation on histology. Umbilical cord anomalies have occasionally been reported. In severe cases, signs in the brain may be detected on prenatal ultrasound. The disease manifests in many forms, making the diagnosis difficult, but the most common features of this disease involve the skin, joints, and central nervous system. All have a maculopapular urticarial skin rash that is often present at birth (75% cases). It is probably more correctly described as an urticarial-like rash. The presence of the rash varies with time, and biopsy of these skin lesions shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate including granulocytes. In about 35-65% of cases, arthritis occurs. Joint signs are variably expressed and can lead to transient swelling without sequelae between crises, or to unpredictable anomalies of growth cartilage and long bones epiphyses suggestive of a pseudo- tumour. Biopsies reveal hypertrophic cartilage without inflammatory cells. This most commonly affects the large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists) but may also involve the small joints of the hands and feet. It is usually bilateral and painful. A common and characteristic feature is giant kneecaps. Severe cases may result in contractures (joint deformities). Most patients eventually have neurological problems. These manifest themselves in three principal ways: chronic meningitis, involvement of both the optic tract and eye, and sensorineural hearing loss. The chronic meningitis presents with the features of chronically raised intracranial pressure: headaches, vomiting, ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, macromegaly, cerebral atrophy, and optic atrophy. Some of these features may be evidenced on prenatal ultrasound. In 50% of cases, intellectual deficit occurs. Seizures occur in 25% of cases, but other manifestations are rare. Histological examination shows infiltration of the meninges with polymorphs. Ocular manifestations occur in 80% of cases and include uveitis (70%), papillary involvement, conjunctivitis, and optical neuritis. If untreated, these may result in blindness (25%). The sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 75%, and tends to be progressive leading to deafness in 20% of cases. Almost all children are remarkably short and have growth delay. Fever is extremely common but inconstant and is most often mild. Anemia is frequent. Other findings that have been reported include macrocephaly (95%), large fontanelle, prominent forehead, flattening of the nasal bridge (saddleback nose), short and thick extremities, and finger clubbing. The liver and/or spleen may be enlarged. Lymph node enlargement may also be present. Later in life, secondary amyloidosis may occur. Delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhoea are not uncommon. Hoarseness due to inflammation of the laryngeal cartilage has also been reported. Causes The disease is caused in 60% of cases by a mutated gene called CIAS1 that is known to be involved in other syndromes that appear somewhat similar, such as Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome and familial cold urticaria. In many patients, the parents do not have the same mutation, indicating the problem was not inherited, even though it is a genetic disease.CIAS1 is involved in controlling the immune system, which is why the mutation leads to out-of-control inflammation. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on observing the patient and finding the constellation of symptoms and signs described above. A few blood tests help, by showing signs of long standing inflammation. There is no specific test for the disease, though now that the gene that causes the disease is known, that may change. Routine laboratory investigations are non specific: anaemia, increased numbers of polymorphs, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein are typically all the abnormalities found. Lumbar puncture shows elevated levels of polymorphs (20-70% of cases) and occasionally raised eosinophil counts (0-30% of cases). CSF neopterin may be elevated.The X ray changes are unique and characteristic of this syndrome. These changes include bony overgrowth due to premature ossification of the patella and the long bone epiphyses in very young children and bowing of long bones with widening and shortening periosteal reaction in older ones. Audiometry shows a progressive sensineural deafness. Visual examination shows optic atrophy and an increase in the blind spot. CT is usually normal but may show enlargement of the ventricles. MRI with contrast may show enhancement of leptomeninges and cochlea consistent with chronic meningitis. EEG shows a non- specific pattern with slow waves and spike discharges. Polymorphs tend to show increased expression of CD10. Differential diagnosis * Aicardi‚ÄìGouti√®res syndrome * Still's disease * Schnitzler syndrome * Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome * Familial Mediterranean fever * Marshall syndrome * Castleman's disease Still's disease does not affect children under 6 months old.Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome in 50% of cases is associated with mevalonate kinase deficiency which can be measured in the leukocytes. Treatment There have been attempts to control the inflammation using drugs that work in other conditions where inflammation is a problem. The most successful of these are steroids, but they have side effects when used long term. Other medications, including methotrexate, colchicine and canakinumab, have been tried with some success. Otherwise, the treatment is supportive, or aimed solely at controlling symptoms and maximizing function. Prognosis Overall, the prognosis for patients with NOMID is not good, though many (80%) live into adulthood, and a few appear to do relatively well. They are at risk for leukemia, infections, and some develop deposits of protein aggregated called amyloid, which can lead to kidney failure and other problems. The neurologic problems are most troubling. The finding that other diseases are related and a better understanding of where the disease comes from may lead to more effective treatments. Epidemiology This is a rare condition with an incidence estimated to be less than 1 in a million live births. About 100 cases have been reported worldwide. The bulk of cases are sporadic but familial forms with autosomal dominant transmission have also been described.

Release and life in UK On 9 July 2010, Skripal, along with three other Russian nationals imprisoned for espionage, was freed as part of a spy swap for the ten Russian agents arrested in the United States as part of the Illegals Program, after being pardoned by the then President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev. The UK government insisted on Skripal being included in the swap. Skripal moved to Salisbury, Wiltshire, where he purchased a house in 2011. According to British security officials, Skripal continued to provide information to the UK and other Western intelligence agencies for a period after 2010. Skripal's wife died in 2012 of disseminated endometrial cancer. His daughter returned to Moscow in 2014 and worked in sales. His son died aged 43 in March 2017, in unknown circumstances, on a visit to Saint Petersburg; Skripal's older brother died within the two years before the poisoning. Both Skripal's wife and his son are buried in a cemetery local to Salisbury. In May 2018, the New York Times reported that Skripal, though retired, was \\"still in the game.\\" While living in Britain he had travelled to other countries, meeting with intelligence officials of the Czech Republic, Estonia and Colombia, most likely discussing Russian spying techniques. In June 2016, he travelled to Estonia to meet local spies. Russia exile Valery Morozov told Channel 4 News Sergei Skripal was still working and in regular contact with military intelligence officers at the Russian Embassy.

Skripal not only traveled, accompanied by MI6 officials to Prague, where he contributed information about the active Russian spy network, some agents Skripal knew from his active service. He provided information to the Estonian secret service in Tallinn, which enabled them to identify three active Russian undercover operatives. Skripal also worked with the Spanish secret service Centro Nacional de Inteligencia, informing the agency about the Russian organized crime in the Spanish region of Costa del Sol.

The police declared a major incident as a number of agencies were involved. Following the incident, health authorities checked 21 members of the emergency services and the public for symptoms; two police officers were treated for possible minor symptoms, said to be itchy eyes and wheezing, while a third, Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who had been sent to Sergei Skripal's house, was in a serious condition. , Bailey remained seriously ill but stable. By 22 March 2018, he had recovered enough to be discharged from the hospital, and by 15 January 2019, he returned to active duty. , Skripal and his daughter remained critically ill. On 29 March, Yulia was reported to be out of critical condition, \\"conscious and talking\\". On 6 March, it was agreed under the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network that the Counter Terrorism Command based within the Metropolitan Police would take over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses to the incident following a COBR meeting chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. On 12 March 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May identified the nerve agent used in the attack as Russian-developed Novichok and demanded explanation from the Russian government. Two days later, May said that Russia was responsible for the incident and announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation. In mid-March 2018, Russia said that its diplomats were denied access to both Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who is a Russian national.–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–º –¥–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∞–º –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø –∫ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ—é –°–∫—Ä–∏–ø–∞–ª—é (Britain refused to grant Russian diplomats access to Sergei Skripal TASS.)

On 6 April, Victoria Skripal, the cousin of poisoned Yulia, was denied a UK visa to visit her relatives in hospital in Salisbury, after reports that she was being coached by Moscow to discredit Yulia. The official reason for the refusal was that there was no evidence that Victoria had previously visited Sergei and Yulia Skripal in the UK, and regardless the Skripals were not in a condition to receive guests. On 7 April, the hospital reported that Sergei Skripal was improving rapidly and was no longer in a critical condition, two days after the improvement had been reported in Moscow following a phone call from his daughter. On 18 May 2018, Sergei Skripal was discharged from the hospital. The Director of Nursing said that further treatment will be provided outside the hospital and that treating the Skripals had been \\"a huge and unprecedented challenge\\". On 16 February 2019, The Sunday Times reported, without identified sources, that Sergei Skripal \\"has suffered a deterioration in his health and is being treated by doctors\\". On 7 June 2020, The Sunday Times reported that Sergei and his daughter have been settled in New Zealand under new identities. The New Zealand Herald raised a number of doubts about the report a few weeks later, however.

He began performing music as Sleek the Elite in 1991, then appeared in the SBS television series Pizza as a character by that same name. He appeared on the first two seasons of Pizza from 2000 to 2001, and in the show's two spinoff films, Fat Pizza (2003) and Fat Pizza vs. Housos (2014). Early life Born in Eastwood, New South Wales of Lebanese descent, Nakad grew up in the Ryde area. At the age of sixteen, Nakad left school. After leaving school he became a refrigeration and air-conditioning technician. Music While working as a technician, Nakad spent his spare time writing music and constantly gigging in small clubs, on community radio and steadily building his form as a unique Lebanese Australian hip-hop voice. This street-cred and his poetic turn of phrase, freestyle technique, and audience support culminated in 1997 when he recorded his first album Sleekism. DJ Soup provided Nakad's unique sample-laden music with groovy, funky, hard hitting beats as well as production. Miguel D'Souza, the host of Mothership Connection on 2SER Community Radio collaborated with Sleek and provided additional vocals for Child of the Cedar. In 2000, Madcap Records reissued Sleekism with altered artwork but with no content alterations. In 2004, Nakad released his second album Hard for a Rapper, which was produced by Def Wish Cast member Sereck. In 2007, rumours of a new album surfaced via his MySpace page. , Sleek the Elite is currently working on a new album, which will be produced by FAZ. Other appearances In 2003, Nakad was guest programmer for Australian music show rage. Acting In 1998, Nakad landed his first acting role in Paul Fenech's short film Basic Equipment, and then later Fenech's feature film, Somewhere in the Darkness. Nakad and Fenech adapted the Sleek the Elite persona to Fenech's comedy series Pizza in 2000 and 2001. In 2003, Nakad appeared in the feature film Fat Pizza. After the release of the movie version of the Pizza series, Nakad left the Pizza team to focus on his rap career, releasing Hard for a Rapper in 2004. Nakad also teamed up with comedian and actor Nick Giannopoulos, appearing in Wog Story. While the show was running in Melbourne, Paul Nakad shared a dressing room with Anh Do. Do was working on the script of the film Footy Legends, and created the role of Walid especially for Nakad. Nakad appeared as the host of an automotive show called Pop Your Hood (Produced by Templar Film & Television), the series was never picked up for air. After many years of obscurity, Nakad played the role of Sleek the Elite once again in the 2014 motion picture Fat Pizza vs. Housos. Nakad will be reprising his role as Sleek The Elite in the new series of Pizza that will be returning in 2019. Personal life Nakad has stated that his five favourite Australian artists are \\"Midnight Oil, Men at Work, Kylie Minogue, Def Wish Cast and myself.\\" Discography *Sleekism (1997) ‚Äì Sleekism Records *Sleekism (2000) ‚Äì reissue from Madcap Records *Sleek the Elite EP (2003) ‚Äì Badfly Records *Hard for a Rapper (2004) ‚Äì Badfly Records Compilations *Home Brewz Volume 2, various artists (1997) ‚Äì \\"Microphone Bangin'\\" *Basic Equipment, various artists (1998) ‚Äì \\"Revelations\\" *Stolen Records, various artists (2004) - \\"Basslines\\" *Guttertalk, various artists (2015) - \\"Meat\\" (with Demunz & Supreme The Truth) Filmography *Basic Equipment (1997), as Himself *Fat Pizza (2003), as Sleek the Elite *Footy Legends (2006), as Walid *Fat Pizza vs. Housos (2014), as Sleek the Elite Television *Pizza (2000, 2001), as Sleek the Elite *Fat Pizza: Back In Business (2019), as Sleek the Elite ReferencesExternal links Paul Nakad at TV.com *Sleek The Elite's Website archived by The Internet Archive 1975 births Living people Australian male television actors Australian people of Lebanese descent Australian male comedians People from Sydney Australian hip hop musicians ","title":"Paul Nakad"},{"id":"6364894","text":"The Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis, named for German chemists Heinrich Kiliani and Hermann Emil Fischer, is a method for synthesizing monosaccharides. It proceeds via synthesis and hydrolysis of a cyanohydrin, thus elongating the carbon chain of an aldose by one carbon atom while preserving stereochemistry on all the previously present chiral carbons. The new chiral carbon is produced with both stereochemistries, so the product of a Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis is a mixture of two diastereomeric sugars, called epimers. For example, D-arabinose is converted to a mixture of D-glucose and D-mannose. Classic Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis The original version of the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis proceeds through cyanohydrin and aldonic acid lactone intermediates. The first step is to react the starting sugar with aqueous cyanide (typically NaCN); the cyanide undergoes nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group of the sugar (while sugars tend to exist mainly as cyclic hemiacetal, they are always in chemical equilibrium with their open- chain aldehyde or ketone forms, and in the case of these aldoses it is that aldehyde form that reacts in this synthesis). The cyanohydrin resulting from this addition is heated in water, which hydrolyzes the cyanide into a carboxylic acid group that quickly reacts with itself to form a more stable lactone. Now there are two diastereomeric lactones in the reaction mixture. They are separated (by chromatography, partition into different solvents, or any of the numerous other separation methods) and then the desired lactone is reduced with a sodium amalgam. As illustrated below, D-arabinose is converted to a mixture of D-glucononitrile and D-mannononitrile, which is then converted to D-gluconolactone and D-mannonolactone, separated, and reduced to D-glucose or D-mannose. The chemical yield by this method tends to be around 30%. Steps of the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis of D-glucose and its C-2 epimer, D-mannose, from D-arabinose Improved version More recently, an improved reduction method has been developed that produces somewhat higher yields of the larger sugars. Instead of conversion of the cyanohydrin to a lactone, the cyanohydrin is reduced with hydrogen, using palladium on barium sulfate as the catalyst and water as the solvent, to form an imine. Due to the presence of water, the imine quickly hydrolyzes to form an aldehyde, thus the final sugars are produced in just two steps rather than three. The separation of the isomers is then performed at the stage of the sugar products themselves rather than at the lactone intermediates. The special catalyst is needed to avoid further reduction of the aldehyde group to a hydroxyl group, which would yield an alditol. These catalysts that limit hydrogenation to one step are called poisoned catalysts; Lindlar palladium is another example. The reactions below illustrate this improved method for the conversion of L-threose to L-lyxose and L-xylose. An improved version of the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis Uses and limitations Both enantiomers of glyceraldehyde are commercially available, so one can access any stereoisomer of any chain-length aldose by an appropriate number of repeated applications of the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis. The triose D-glyceraldehyde (1) leads to the tetroses D-erythrose (2a) and D-threose (2b). Those lead to the pentoses D-ribose (3a) and D-arabinose (3b), and D-xylose (3c) and D-lyxose (3d), respectively. The next iteration leads to the hexoses D-allose (4a) and D-altrose (4b), D-glucose (4c) and D-mannose (4d), D-gulose (4e) and D-idose (4f), and D-galactose (4g) and D-talose (4h). The D-heptoses and beyond are available by continuing the sequence, and enantiomeric L series is available by starting the sequence with L-glyceraldehyde. Successive iterations of the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis allow access to all diastereomers of any chain-length for a specific absolute stereochemistry of the initial reactant In practice, the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis is usually used for production of sugars that are difficult or impossible to obtain from natural sources. While it does provide access to every possible stereoisomer of any desired aldose, the process is limited in by its low yield and use of toxic reagents. In addition, the process requires having a supply of the previous sugar in the series, which may itself require substantial synthetic work if it is not readily available. For example, if successive iterations of the Kiliani‚ÄìFischer synthesis are used, the overall yield drops approximately exponentially for each additional iteration. The process only provides direct access to aldoses, whereas some sugars of interest may instead be ketoses. Some ketoses may be accessible from similar aldoses by isomerization via an enediol intermediate; for example, on standing in aqueous base, glucose, fructose, and mannose will slowly interconvert since they share an enediol form. (See Lobry de Bruyn‚Äìvan Ekenstein transformation). Some unusual sugars are also accessible via aldol addition. See also *Homologation reactions *Wohl degradation References *Carey, Francis A.

The high level of public interest was a result of the professional documentation of routine rodeo cruelty by Jeanie and Troy Walker.http://www.norodeo.org/norodeo.htm Who Is No Rodeo The total number of first preference votes received by the seven independent candidates was reasonable at 2131,See ABC Election Results Website for the electorates of Adelaide, Giles, Kaurna, Light, Newland, Reynell & Stuart particularly given that the independent candidates campaigned on a shoe-string budget. There was no television, radio or print advertising available to the ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù independent candidates as funds simply did not permit. The major campaign expense was the purchase of election posters, yet the total number of election posters used by the ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù candidates was still only 400. This small number of posters was divided between the seven candidates. Even without deliberate sabotage,Despite being an offence, approximately 80% of the ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù campaign posters were removed shortly after their erection. This was reported to police. In one case a person associated with rodeo events was caught at night in the act of climbing up pole to which a ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù poster was affixed. The person‚Äôs explanation to the police was that he was only climbing the pole to ‚Äúget a better look at the poster.‚Äù It is interesting that media interest in the deliberate sabotage of the ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù posters gave some casual observers the mistaken view that the ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù campaign had involved the use of a large number of posters. such a poster campaign was dwarfed by the number of posters in use by minor and major parties. The independent ‚ÄúNo Rodeo‚Äù candidates were prior to the election well aware of the limitations of their campaign. They were not na√Øve and never believed themselves to be serious election contenders.

Education  Sunway has also become known as a higher education hub, with two large universities in the area, namely Monash University Malaysia,http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/9/4/nation/18774335&sec;=nation and Sunway University, as well as other private colleges such as Sunway College, Le Cordon Bleu Malaysia and The One Academy. There are other notable schools in Sunway which are SK Bandar Sunway, SMK Bandar Sunway, SK Kampung Lindungan and Sunway International School.  Healthcare  Ramsay Sime Darby Medical Centre, though not part of Bandar Sunway, is one of the two private hospitals in Subang Jaya, along the Sunway Medical Centre. Healthcare in Sunway is provided by private hospital, Sunway Medical Centre, along with Sime Darby Medical Centre (previously Subang Jaya Medical Centre) in adjacent Subang Jaya.  Religion  Sunway comprises many other companies and residences not owned by the Sunway group. Places of worship include Masjid Al- Husna, which is located right opposite Sunway Pyramid. Several Buddhist Centres (like Subang Jaya Buddhist Association, Passaddhi Buddhist Centre and Dharma Drum Mountain Buddhist Centre) and churches are located in the vicinity as well, most notably the nearest Catholic churches would be St Ignatius Church in Kelana Jaya, Petaling Jaya as well as Church of the Assumption in Jalan Templer, Old Town, Petaling Jaya and the Church of St Thomas More in USJ, Subang Jaya.  Transport The Bandar Sunway stretch of the Damansara‚ÄìPuchong Expressway (LDP) during the evening rush hour. Bandar Sunway is connected to the cities of Kuala Lumpur, Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya and Klang via a network of highways, namely the Federal Highway, the Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS), the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), the New Pantai Expressway (NPE), the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway Central Link (ELITE) and the Damansara‚ÄìPuchong Expressway (LDP). The township is also served by an urban- suburb rail link, the Subang Jaya Komuter station.  Public transport  Bandar Sunway is home to Malaysia's first (and to date, only) bus rapid transit line, the BRT Sunway Line. It connects the Setia Jaya Komuter station (Sunway-Setia Jaya) in the north until the USJ7 station in the south, passing through Sunway Mentari, Sunway Pyramid and Monash University in the process. Sunway Monorail operated in Bandar Sunway from 2000 to 2007. The system has since been shut down due to the expansion of the Sunway Pyramid 2, and part of its infrastructure were later incorporated into the BRT line. Alternately, there are rapidKL bus services connecting Sunway Pyramid to Subang Jaya station, some 15‚Äì20 minutes away. The Selangor state government also provides its subsidized bus service - the Smart Selangor bus route SJ02, connecting Bandar Sunway to Puchong, allowing an alternative to the longer Puchong-Putra Heights-USJ 7 train ride. The Subang Airport is 13 kilometres from this development; since May 2018 rail connection to the airport is possible via an interchange at Subang Jaya station to the . Car Bandar Sunway is located near the junction of the LDP and KL‚ÄìPort Klang Federal Highway . Motorists coming from Puchong, Putrajaya and even Seremban will opt for the LDP. A few kilometres south lies another interchange, this time between the LDP and KESAS , which connects Pandamaran near Port Klang to Sri Petaling. Running directly in front of Sunway Pyramid mall is the NPE , which runs from Subang Jaya to Angkasapuri in Lembah Pantai in southwestern Kuala Lumpur. Politics and administration The township falls within the neighbourhood sections of PJS 7 to PJS 11 (PJS meaning \\"Petaling Jaya Selatan\\" or Petaling Jaya South). Since 1997 much of Bandar Sunway was governed by the MBSJ, taking over from MBPJ. MBPJ however retains administration over the northern part of the township, including PJS 10, PJS 5, PJS 6, Sunway Mentari and Setia Jaya. Bandar Sunway falls under the Subang constituency of the Malaysian Parliament, currently held by Wong Chen of the PKR. On the state level, Bandar Sunway is represented in the Selangor State Legislative Assembly as part of Subang Jaya (state constituency). The incumbent assemblywoman for Subang Jaya is Michelle Ng from the DAP who succeeded Hannah Yeoh of the DAP since the aftermath of Malaysian general election, 2018.

The ship was originally laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC Hull 1897) as USS Renate (AKA-36) on 21 November 1944 at Providence, R.I., by Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc.; launched on 31 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph L. Baker; and commissioned at State Pier No.1, Providence, on 28 February 1945, Lt. Cmdr. Joseph F. Wickham, USNR, in command. Renate was an named after the minor planet 575 Renate. \\"Renate\\" is a female German surname derived from Latin \\"renatus\\" (= born again). The ship was later converted for hydrographic missions and renamed USS Maury (AGS-16) in 1946, named after the astronomer and hydrographer Matthew Fontaine Maury. Service history=World War II, 1945-1946 After completing her fitting-out at Boston, Massachusetts (USA), Renate conducted shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay (13-19 March), after which time she underwent post- shakedown availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia (USA); she ultimately sailed for the Panama Canal Zone on 31 March 1945. After transiting the canal, she arrived at Balboa on 6 April, and sailed thence two days later, bound for Hawaiian waters and steaming independently. Renate reached Pearl Harbor on 21 April, underwent an inspection six days later, and completed discharging cargo on the 29th. USS Renate (AKA-36) at Sasebo in 1945. Bringing cargo-loading operations to completion on 13 May, Renate embarked 197 enlisted passengers ‚Äî sailors, marines, and soldiers ‚Äî and two naval officers for transportation the following day, and sailed for the Marshall Islands. Steaming independently, her men standing daily dawn and dusk alerts, the attack cargo ship crossed the 180th meridian on 18 May, and ultimately reached Eniwetok on the 22nd. Pushing on, bound for the western Carolines, on 5 June, she followed a lone course to Ulithi, arriving on 9 June. Next assigned to convoy UOK-36, Renate got underway for Okinawa on 10 July, dropping anchor in Buckner Bay on the 14th. Interrupting cargo operations to sortie on 19 July to evade a typhoon, she ultimately completed discharging cargo five days later, getting underway to return to Ulithi on 25 July with convoy OKU-16. Anchoring in Ulithi lagoon on the last day of July, Renate got underway on 2 August for Pearl Harbor. Again steaming independently, she crossed the International Date Line on 10 August, and reached her destination on the 13th. Shifting to Kahului, Maui, ten days later, she completed cargo operations the following day, and sailed to return to Pearl on the 25th. Departing on 14 May, she returned to Hawaii the day before the Surrender of Japan and was assigned to Operation \\"Campus\\", the occupation of the Japan's home islands. She got underway for Ky≈´sh≈´ 1 September, mooring 16 days later at Sasebo where she disembarked units of the U.S. 5th Marine Division. Completing another occupation troop lift, from the Philippines to Sasebo, in early October, she joined in operation Operation \\"Magic Carpet\\", the transportation of veterans back to the United States. With San Francisco as her terminus she completed two \\"Magic Carpet\\" runs by mid January 1946. The next month she sailed for the East Coast, arriving at Norfolk on the 26th. Conversion to survey ship, 1946 In June 1946, she entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for conversion to a survey ship and on 12 July was renamed USS Maury (AGS-16). As Maury she emerged from the shipyard in October with a new silhouette. Electronic survey and sounding equipment, as well as photographic, printing, and repair shops had been added within her compartments and a helipad, helicopter, and sound boats had been provided topside. The boats would be used in charting positions and depths accurately, while the ship's helicopter would transport surveyors and their equipment to points ashore and perform aerial photographic missions. On 6 January 1947 Maury got underway for the Pacific and her first hydrographic mission, the charting of the waters around Truk and Kwajalein. Having added to navigational knowledge of those areas she sailed for San Francisco, arriving on 13 September and remaining until 11 July 1948. She then got underway for New York City where she reported for duty with Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 10 August. Atlantic Fleet, 1948-1959 During 1949, 1950, and 1951, Maury made three 8-month cruises to the Persian Gulf, constructing charts of those waters, accompanied by the tugs and . In October 1952, in concert with and she began a resurvey of the North Atlantic, to correct existing false soundings on navigational charts and studying methods for hurricane and weather predictions. Through 1957 she served in the Western Atlantic, surveying as far north as Newfoundland in the summer months and working to the south, as far as the West Indies, during the winter. In 1958 Maury returned to the Mediterranean for an abbreviated deployment, from 3 February to 9 May. In July her North Atlantic resurvey missions were extended and she crossed the ocean to chart the waters in and around the Shetland and Faroe Islands. Throughout this period, while fulfilling her primary assignment of correcting navigational charts, she added to meteorological knowledge by studying the North Atlantic's weather patterns, particularly with regard to hurricanes. Early in the Spring of 1959 Maury again passed through the Straits of Gibraltar. Continuing on to the Eastern Mediterranean she began a study of the Turkish coast. By September she was ready to extend that survey to the Turkish Black Sea coast and on the 17th and 18th transited the Dardanelles. Maury thus became the first U.S. naval unit to enter the Black Sea since 1945. Also Odessa Russia 1959. Pacific Fleet, 1960-1969 Maury in Thailand, circa 1961. The next year, 1960, Maury was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and by 22 March was operating out of Pearl Harbor. Attached to the 7th Fleet's logistic support group during her extended cruises, she completed a preliminary survey of the Gulf of Siam in preparation for her next long range assignment, an accurate survey of designated areas of the southwestern Pacific and Indian Oceans. After modernization at Pearl Harbor, she returned to the Gulf of Siam in December with . Working in concert, Maury concentrated on hydrographic survey, while Serrano gathered information on the physical and chemical makeup of the waters and ocean floor. During their 1961, 1962 and 1963 7th Fleet tours, the oceanographic vessels charted and collected data on the Gulf of Siam, the Andaman Sea, the Straits of Malacca and areas of the Philippines, punctuating those tours with missions of mercy as the occasion demanded. On 1 February 1965 Maury departed Pearl Harbor for a 4-month survey of the continental shelf off Buenaventura, Colombia. Returning to Oahu on 2 June, she began preparations for her return to Southeast Asia. Departing on 15 November she soon commenced a 7-month survey of the coast of South Vietnam. Concentrating on the Mekong Delta area during that cruise, she has resumed her study of the Vietnamese coast with each annual deployment. Into 1969 her efforts added significantly to knowledge of the characteristics of the coastal area in which U.S. naval forces conducted riverine warfare and amphibious operations. After completing her last operational survey operations, off the coast of the Republic of Korea, Maury sailed for the United States. Pausing at Pearl Harbor en route, she stood out for the West Coast on her final voyage on 1 December 1969. Decommissioning She reached San Francisco on 8 December 1969, off-loading fuel, ammunition, and vehicles before shifting to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Mare Island, Vallejo, California (USA), later the same day. Decommissioned on 19 December 1969, Maury was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. The ship remained at the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility until transferred to the custody of the Maritime Administration (MARAD) on 26 June 1970. Taken to MARAD's Suisun Bay, California, berthing area, she remained there until sold to the National Steel and Metal Co., of Terminal Island, Calif., on 10 August 1973 to be broken up for scrap.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, Argentina, Brazil and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. Synopsis The first half of 2005 was fairly slow when it comes to tornadoes. There were no major outbreaks in the first half of 2005, which is rather unusual. The inactivity in what is normally the peak months can be related to a stable low-pressure system that blocked the parade of storms from moving eastward.MyWire  USA TODAY: Tornado numbers far below normal in '05 The third quarter of 2005 was dominated by the tropics, and many of the tornadoes were related to the many hurricanes and tropical storms of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Several of the tornadoes were destructive. November was clearly the most active month for tornado activity in the US, with four significant - and completely separate - tornado events, as the wind pattern shifted and the warm tropical Gulf of Mexico added fuel to the fire when cold fronts passed southward, initiating the development of tornado outbreaks. December was much quieter as colder Arctic air became entrenched and the cold fronts became far less active. There were officially 1,265 tornadoes confirmed in the US in 2005. EventsJanuary There were 33 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/2005/1/table January 3 (Brazil) Crici√∫ma, Santa Catarina, was hit by two F1 tornadoes. Tornadoes struck two streets of the Great Santa Luzia, completely destroying houses and knocking down trees and walls. Small fires, originated from short circuits, also affected the city. January 7 Six tornadoes touched down; five in Mississippi and one in Alabama. A F2 tornado tracked 3 miles southeast of Pine Ridge, Mississippi. There were no fatalities and injuries from the outbreak. January 8-11 An unusual series of tornadoes struck California. Four tornadoes touched in the state over four days, including a F1 tornado southeast of Eggeville, California on January 8. In addition to the California tornadoes, a 10 yd wide waterspout moved onshore between Waimea and Pakala Village, Hawaii, producing F0 damage along a 5-mile path on January 9. No deaths or injuries occurred. January 12-14 An outbreak of 21 tornadoes occurred over a three-day period from the 12th to the 14th. On the night of the 12th, a 250-yard wide F2 tornado traveled 15 miles in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana from southwest of Homer to west of Arizona, injuring 12. An even stronger 900-yard wide F3 tornado tracked 24 miles through Union County, Arkansas, striking the town of Lawson. Two people were killed and 13 were injured. On the 13th, an F1 tornado touched down near Arlington, Georgia and carried a small double wide trailer 35 feet before it impacted the ground and disintegrated. Of the five people inside, two were killed and three were injured. Two others were also injured by this tornado. In South Carolina, an F2 tornado struck Laurens, where homes, businesses, and a factory were damaged. A mobile home was destroyed and one person was injured. On the 14th, an F2 tornado near Rockwell, North Carolina snapped trees, flattened a barn, and heavily damaged two metal industrial buildings. Overall, the outbreak killed four people and injured 31. January 28 (Africa) A storm produced strong winds, severe hail, and an F1 tornado in the southern Manzini and Shiselweni regions of Swaziland. 30 people were killed, though it is unknown how many of these deaths are directly attributable to the tornado. February There were 10 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/2005/2/table February 19‚Äì26 A collection of nine tornadoes struck California on four out of the eight days from Mid to Late‚ÄìFebruary. The strongest tornado was an 25 yard wide F1 tornado that tracked 2.8 miles into Temecula, California on February 19.

The outbreak began on the 21st, producing 14 F0 tornadoes and one F1 tornado across Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. The tornado activity on the following day was more significant. The Storm Prediction Center's (SPC) Day 1 Outlook at 8 am EST, Tuesday morning, March 22 showed a slight risk for severe weather across much of the Southeast U.S. A moderate risk covered northern Mississippi, most of Alabama, and southwest Georgia. The atmosphere was very favorable for tornadic supercells with a warm front north of Tallahassee, Florida in southern Georgia and a center of low pressure back in eastern Oklahoma with a trailing cold front extending down through Louisiana into the Gulf of Mexico. A high-end F2 passed southeast of Ardilla, Alabama near Gordon, Alabama, destroying two homes and three barns. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, and several mobile homes were damaged as well. Four people were injured and transported to a hospital.

All 24 fatalities and 238 of the 247 injuries from the outbreak came from this tornado alone. November 12 An outbreak produced 14 tornadoes; 12 in Iowa and one each in Missouri and Arkansas. It was an unusual in that the outbreak was largest ever recorded in Iowa in November (only 23 tornadoes had been confirmed in Iowa in November since 1950), and among the largest outbreaks that far north and west in the United States that late in the year. The worst tornado of the outbreak was a 150 yard wide F3 tornado that tracked 17.6 miles across three Iowa counties while also striking the west side of Stratford, killing one and injuring three.

On November 27, a mini-supercell outbreak spawned 19 weak tornadoes in Kansas. This was quite unusual as the state had only had two November tornado days in the last 20 years. In Missouri, an F2 tornado struck Ripley County, killing one when a two-story house was destroyed. An F0 tornado also caused extensive damage when it struck the Western St. Louis suburb of Maplewood. The worst tornadoes occurred in Arkansas, where 38 tornadoes touched down. A long- tracked F3 tornado struck Interstate 40 one mile west of Plumerville, killing one and injuring seven. The same tornado also moved through Hill Creek, causing additional damage and another injury before dissipating just after passing through Springfield. The one death and eight of the 11 injuries that occurred in Arkansas came from this tornado alone. Eight weak tornadoes touched down in the Southeast on November 28 before the outbreak ended. In all, 73 tornadoes were confirmed along with the two fatalities and 15 injuries. December There were 26 tornadoes confirmed in the US in December.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/2005/12/table See also * Tornado ** Tornadoes by year ** Tornado records ** Tornado climatology ** Tornado myths * List of tornado outbreaks ** List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes ** List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of 21st-century Canadian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of European tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of tornadoes and tornado outbreaks in Asia ** List of Southern Hemisphere tornadoes and tornado outbreaks ** List of tornadoes striking downtown areas * Tornado intensity ** Fujita scale ** Enhanced Fujita scale References External links  * Monthly Tornado Stats (SPC) * Annual Severe Weather Report Summary 2005 (SPC) * U.S. tornadoes in 2005 - Tornado History Project * Tornado project tornadoes of 2005 * Storm Data \\"2005 Annual Summaries\\" (NCDC) 2005 meteorology Tornado-related lists by year Torn ","title":"Tornadoes of 2005"},{"id":"6364961","text":"Beer cheese may refer to: * Weisslacker, a German cheese * Beer cheese (spread), a regional snack food * Beer soup ","title":"Beer cheese"},{"id":"6364969","text":"Lower Marsh is a street in the Waterloo neighbourhood of London, England. It is adjacent to Waterloo railway station in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is the location of Lower Marsh Market. History Until the early 19th century much of north Lambeth (now known as the South Bank) was mostly marsh. The settlement of Lambeth Marsh was built on a raised through road over the marsh lands, potentially dating back to Roman times. The land on which it stands was owned by the church of England, with Lambeth Palace nearby. Records and maps show that it was a separate village until the early 19th Century when the church sold off the land in small pockets, thereby leading to random development of individual houses rather than the grander redevelopments occurring north of the river. Lower Marsh and The Cut formed the commercial heart of the area from the early 19th century. The northern tip of the ancient parish of Lambeth was a marshland known as Lambeth Marshe, but it was drained in the 18th century and is remembered in the Lower Marsh street name. Sometime after the opening of Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as Waterloo. Previously regarded as a comparatively underdeveloped location, Lower Marsh has more recently undergone gentrification, supported by private enterprise and injections of capital from Lambeth and Southwark councils. , Lower Marsh street is a vibrant road, home of Lower Marsh Market and a variety of vintage shops, pubs, bookshops, art galleries, independent coffee spaces and a variety of restaurants featuring food from many ethnic origins. The market has 77 stalls.

Hassall was born in Middlesex as the youngest son of five children in a house of a surgeon.

He entered medicine through apprenticeship in 1834 to his uncle Sir James Murray (1788‚Äì1871), spending his early career in Dublin, where he also studied botany and the seashore.A short biography of Sir James Murray, onlineWikisource Biographie √ºber Sir James Murray In 1846 he published a two-volume study, The Microscopic Anatomy of the Human Body in Health and Disease, the first English textbook on the subject. After further studying botany at Kew and publishing on botanical topics, particularly freshwater algae, he came to public attention with his 1850 book A microscopical examination of the water supplied to the inhabitants of London and the suburban districts, which became an influential work in promoting the cause of water reform. In the early 1850s he also studied food adulteration; his reports were published in The Lancet by reformer Thomas Wakley and led directly to the 1860 Food Adulteration Act and subsequent further legislation against the practice. He also worked as physician at the Royal Free Hospital, but required long breaks through ill-health due to pulmonary tuberculosis, and in 1869 moved to the Isle of Wight. On the basis of his experience of the microclimate of the Undercliff, he established the National Cottage Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest (later Royal National Hospital for Diseases of the Chest), a sanatorium at Ventnor, Isle of Wight. The buildings were designed by local architect Thomas Hellyer. From 1878 onward, aiming to rest in warmer climates, he spent most of his time in Europe, gaining permission to practise both in San Remo, where he and his family lived, and Lucerne, where he worked in the summer. During this time he wrote extensively on climatic treatments for tuberculosis, works such as the 1879 San Remo and the Western Riviera Climatically and Medically Considered.By Candlelight: The Life of Dr Arthur Hill Hassall (1817-1894), Ernest A Gray, London: Robert Hale, 1983, Review, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Volume 76, November 1983 His autobiography, The narrative of a busy life, was published in 1893. Two medical terms are named after Hassall: Hassall's corpuscles, which are spherical bodies in the medulla of the thymus gland, and Hassall‚ÄìHenle bodies, which are abnormal growths in the Descemet membrane of the eye. His Ventnor hospital operated until 1964 when it closed, made obsolete by drug treatment of tuberculosis, to be demolished in 1969. Its grounds are now the site of Ventnor Botanic Garden.

Foote has worked as an English-language commentator for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) since 2015. He previously worked for WWE from 1996 to 2003 and Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2010 to 2017. Early life  Kelly was born in New York City, New York, but his family relocated to Stuart, Florida when he was ten. He graduated from Florida State University in January 1990. Broadcasting career=Radio Kelly first became involved in broadcasting when he began working as a disc jockey, playing music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Kelly once hosted a segment named \\"Plan B\\" on the Voice of Wrestling Internet radio program. In August 2007, Kelly started his own show on the Wrestling Radio Network called The Kevin Kelly Show. Kelly also hosts The Big Picture audio show on ClubWWI.com. In 2014, Kevin Kelly began hosting a wrestling and pop culture podcast, The Kevin Kelly Show, on Place to Be Nation.http://placetobe.podbean.com/ Professional wrestlingIndependent circuit (1991‚Äì1996, 1999‚Äì2005, 2011)= Kelly debuted on the professional wrestling independent circuit in 1991. He originally worked as a ring announcer for Eddie Mansfield's Orlando, Florida-based International Wrestling Federation. In November 1999, Kelly debuted in the Delaware-based East Coast Wrestling Association as a manager, forming several heel stables. On April 7, 2001 in Wilmington, Delaware, Kelly defeated Cheetah Master for the ECWA Heavyweight Championship with the help of Billy Fives and Rick Fuller, members of Kelly's Alliance of Defiance stable. He was stripped of the title on May 5, 2001, with Scoot Andrews defeating Billy Fives for the vacant title. On December 3, 2005, Kelly was inducted into the ECWA Hall of Fame. From 2003 to 2004, he worked for the short-lived Major League Wrestling promotion. From May 28, 2011 to October 22, 2011, Kelly was an announcer for Lucha Libre USA Season 2. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1996‚Äì2003)= Kelly received a try-out with the World Wrestling Federation as a ring announcer due to the intervention of fellow IWF alumnus Billy Gunn. He was hired by the WWF in June 1996. In 1997, Kelly, alongside Michael Cole and Jim Ross, served as the commentator for Raw is War, the flagship television program of the WWF. In 1999, Kelly began serving as an interviewer on Raw is War and SmackDown!. As an interviewer, Kelly was involved in numerous angles. The most publicized was the controversial \\"Pillman's got a gun\\" angle, which took place on the November 4, 1996 episode of Monday Night Raw, which was filmed in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The angle was set against the backdrop of an ongoing feud between Brian Pillman and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Throughout the broadcast of Monday Night Raw, live footage was shown of Kelly interviewing Pillman in his home in Walton, Kentucky alongside Pillman's wife Melanie. After Dok Hendrix informed Monday Night Raw announcer Vince McMahon that Austin was supposedly traveling to Pillman's home, Pillman, upon being apprised of this development, produced and loaded a 9 mm Glock pistol and stated that he would \\"blow [Austin's] sorry ass straight to hell!\\" A frightened Kelly delivered the line \\"Pillman's got a gun!\\" In the course of the interview, Austin arrived at Pillman's home and, after fighting off several of Pillman's friends who had surrounded the house to protect him, broke into the house and advanced on Pillman. Pillman responded by pointing his pistol at Austin, with the live camera feed subsequently fading to black as Kelly and Melanie Pillman screamed. When the camera feed returned, Pillman was being restrained by his friends, and Kelly informed McMahon that there had been two explosions, but no-one had been injured. At that point, Austin re- entered the house, with Pillman's friends forcing him out again as Pillman pointed his pistol at Austin while screaming obscenities and threats. Kelly shouted for someone to \\"call the police\\" as Monday Night Raw color commentator Jerry Lawler instructed him to \\"get the gun\\". The broadcast ended with Austin being driven from the house as Melanie Pillman cried. The WWF and Pillman would later apologize for the segment. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kelly would frequently be mocked by The Rock during interviews, with The Rock labeling him an \\"ugly hermaphrodite\\" and nicknaming him \\"Hermie\\". At Unforgiven on September 24, 2000, Kelly was attacked by the returning Stone Cold Steve Austin while attempting to interview him. Kelly would later begin hosting the weekly WWF webcast Byte This!. In addition to his on-screen roles, Kelly served as a WWF talent scout, monitoring wrestlers in the Heartland Wrestling Association, Memphis Championship Wrestling, Ohio Valley Wrestling and Urban Wrestling Alliance developmental territories. Kelly was responsible for watching and evaluating tapes of matches sent to the WWF by prospective employees. Kelly also had a minor degree of influence on the creative direction of the WWF, and was the creator of the storyline that saw Stephanie McMahon marry Triple H, creating the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. In addition, Kelly produced WWE Confidential. On March 21, 2003, Kelly was released by WWE as part of a series of budget cuts. Since his release, Kelly has criticized the corporate policies and creative direction of his former employer. =Ring of Honor (2010‚Äì2017)= On March 2, 2010, Jim Cornette announced that Kelly had signed an agreement to be the voice of Ring of Honor on Internet pay-per- view Between 2011 and 2017, Kelly served as main play-by-play announcer for Ring of Honor television tapings and pay-per-views.

A constituent assembly endorsed the dynastic change in December, only three Socialist Deputies abstaining. (Nikki R. Keddie, p. 86). and Mohammad Reza Shah. Taqizadeh was also a prominent scholar; his studies on Iranian calendars remain reference work up until now. Although in the modern political history Taqizadeh is known as a secular politician, who believed that \\"outwardly and inwardly, in body and in spirit, Iran must become Europeanized\\",\\"In Berlin the Democrat leader Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh edited two series of the important newspaper Kaveh (named after a legendary blacksmith who liberated Iran). The first series, published during the War, aimed largely at getting Iranians to support the Central Powers against Britain and Russia, while the second was the main organ of the new Iranian nationalist culture. In addition to supporting new young writers like Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh, it contained striking editorial features by Taqizadeh, in one of which he said that Iran must become wholly Western in every way if it were to progress; this is perhaps the high point of the Westernist view of nationalism, which Taqizadeh himself later modified.\\" (Nikki R. Keddie, p. 181). he came from a traditional Islamic Sayyed-family (descendant of Muhammad). His father, Sayyed Taqi, was a clergyman and when Sayyed Hasan became a mullah, it seemed likely that he would follow in his father's footsteps. From an early age Taqizadeh showed interest in enlightened ideas and the Western concept of constitutionalism. This interest can be traced back to the socio-political sphere in which Taqizadeh became an adult. He grew up in Tabriz, the capital city of East Azerbaijan province, which was the gateway to the modern and progressive ideas coming from Russia and especially Western Europe. In the time of World War I, World War II and after, Taqizadeh was the most influential person in Iran who supported the interests of German Empire against Russia and Britain. Biography Sayyed Hasan Teqizadeh (around 1906) Secretly Taqizadeh studied French and English for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the Western enlightenment and modern political thoughts. Nevertheless, he became mullah and remained one until the period in which the traditional Iranian political and socio-economic system disintegrated and the modern Iranian nation-state was formed. As early as the beginning of his political career he confronted the corrupt and despotic r√©gime of the Qajar princes, who seemed unable to prevent the decay of their dynasty. Convinced of the destructive consequences of the despotism and corruption for the political and socio-economic development of Iran, Taqizadeh actively participated in the Constitutional Revolution (Mashruteh Revolution), which resulted in the foundation of the Majles (Parliament - ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿ¥Ÿàÿ±ÿß€å ŸÖŸÑ€å). From this period onwards he developed into a secular enlightened politician. In 1908 his life was saved by Claude Stokes a British military attach√© who allowed him to take refuge in the legation compound. He was then secured safe passage to England where he worked with Edward Granville Browne to lobby parliament for support of the constitutionalist movement. In 1909, under the guidance of Taqizadeh the first modern pro German political party, the Ferqeh-ye Demokrat-e Iran (Democratic Party of Iran), was founded in Iran. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Taqizadeh allied with Germany against Russia and Britain. In Berlin he established the Komiteh-ye Iran (Committee of Iran), and together with other prominent Iranian intellectuals, he published the influential periodical Kaveh (1916‚Äì1922), which was distributed in Europe as well as in Iran. Kaveh was a political and literary journal which greatly contributed to the creation of the Iranian consciousness and national identity. This journal emphasized the need for national independence, and internal reforms, especially secular and educational ones. Under the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi (1925‚Äì1941), Taqizadeh contributed to the formation of the modern Iranian nation-state. During his political career of seventy years, Taqizadeh served as parliamentarian, governor-general of Khorasan province, minister of Roads and Transportation, minister of Finance, and ambassador to the United Kingdom and France. Although at the time of the Constitutional Revolution he opposed the formation of the Senate (Majles-e Sena, ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥ ÿ≥ŸÜÿß ‚Äî defunct since 1979, following adoption of a new constitution), in 1950, during the imperial government of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (1941‚Äì1978), he became its President. Taqizadeh described his life as a \\"tempestuous life\\" (Zendegi-ye Tufani), which he later used as the title of his autobiography. Taqizadeh's views are not characterized by ideological continuity, but by many breaks in the course of his life, which have contributed to the difficulty of writing a consistent account of his life. Taqizadeh was a natural politician. If he was convinced that his alliance with a person or country would further interests of Iran, he often was ready to ally himself with them. Similarly, he would abandon his allies if he believed that his alliance would be detrimental to his country. The following two quotations are indicative of the divergence of views that exist concerning Taqizadeh: > \\"He [Taqizadeh] had won deserved fame by his fearless independence and > wonderful grasp of political affairs. There is something so sympathetic in > his face, so attractive, with eyes sparkling with cheerful animation. (...). > If I am not mistaken he is of those whose genius is capable of inspiring > great enthusiasm, great sacrifices, and whose influence leaves a lasting > impression of the history of nations.\\" (Edward Granville Browne) > \\"In which position was Taqizadeh true and sincere? What were the motives of > that contradictory behaviour? He was not adept at political truth and > honour.\\" (Fereydun Adamiyat) Views vary as to the degree to which Taqizadeh served the interests of Iran and her people. Some experts believe that he made the Iranian interests secondary to that of the United Kingdom during the period of the Constitutional Revolution, and to that of Germany during World War I. Others suggest that he allied with the United Kingdom with the intention of protecting Iran against the Russian expansionist policies. They are of the opinion that Taqizadeh was a supporter of the Iranian constitution and that during World War I, he allied with Germany to oppose the Anglo-Russian influence which was aimed at undermining Iran's independence. In addition, they believe that in 1942 Taqizadeh attempted to bring about a close relationship between Iran and the United States of America in order to guarantee a balance of powers conducive to Iran's independence.

The design resembles the Doge's Palace in Venice. p. 107 History The foundation stone for the theater was laid September 3, 1894, a day after Odessa's one-hundred- year birthday. The building was intended as the new stock exchange, or \\"New Exchange\\" to replace the old stock exchange, and the vast hall was decorated with six panels by the artist Nikolai Nikolaevich Karazin (1842-1908) which depict commerce throughout various stages of history.Kononova p. 106-107 p. 267 Like the Odessa Opera Theater before it, a world competition was announced for a conceptual design of a new Odessa stock exchange. The design of Czech architect V.J. Prohaska was considered the best. But this design did not meet all of the requirements, therefore it was modified and improved by Alexander Osipovich Bernardacci. Construction was completed in 1898. Since 1924 the building has housed the Odessa Philharmonic. Construction The theater can seat 1,000 people and is 15 meters high and 910 square meters. The large hall has no supporting columns, and because of this, it was one of the most expensive buildings in Odessa to build.Kononova, p.107, 108Herlihy, p. 267, states the main hall is 60 meters by 120 meters The main entrance is by a large open-sided, roofed gallery, called a loggia. The ceiling of this open entry is painted with the twelve symbols of the Zodiac.

Interesting Mythology It is an enduring myth that everyone in the city knows (and continues to promulgate) that since the building was originally designed as a Stock exchange rather than a concert hall it was made to be sound-resistant, rather than sound-conducting, in order to provide more privacy to visitors.

Each desired to name the area after his hometown. Pettygrove, from Portland, Maine, won the toss, and the town site became known as Portland, Oregon. The two would plat sixteen blocks of the town that year; Lovejoy later sold his stake to Benjamin Stark in 1845. Also in 1845, Lovejoy married Elizabeth McGary.

Li does not encompass a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea and, as such, is translated in a number of different ways. Wing-tsit Chan explains that li originally meant \\"a religious sacrifice, but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with Natural law.\\" In Chinese cosmology, human agency participates in the ordering of the universe by Li ('rites'). There are several Chinese definitions of a rite, one of the most common definitions is that it transforms the invisible to visible; through the performance of rites at appropriate occasions, humans make visible the underlying order. Performing the correct ritual focuses, links, orders, and moves the social, which is the human realm, in correspondence with the terrestrial and celestial realms to keep all three in harmony. This procedure has been described as centering, which used to be the duty of the Son of Tian, the emperor. But it was also done by all those who conducted state, ancestral, and life-cycle rites and, in another way, by Daoists who conducted the rites of local gods as a centering of the forces of exemplary history, of liturgical service, of the correct conduct of human relations, and of the arts of divination such as the earliest of all Chinese classics‚Äîthe Book of Changes (Yi Jing)‚Äîjoining textual learning to bodily practices for health and the harmonized enhancement of circuits of energy (qi). Scope The rites of li are not rites in the Western conception of religious custom. Rather, li embodies the entire spectrum of interaction with humans, nature, and even material objects. Confucius includes in his discussions of li such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. Xunzi cites \\"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring\\" as vital parts of the fabric of li. Approaches to Li Among the earliest historical discussions on li stands the 25th year of Zhao Gong () in the Zuo Zhuan. Li consists of the norms of proper social behavior as taught to others by fathers, village elders and government officials. The teachings of li promoted ideals such as filial piety, brotherliness, righteousness, good faith and loyalty. The influence of li guided public expectations, such as the loyalty to superiors and respect for elders in the community. Continuous with the emphasis on community, following li included the internalization of action, which both yields the comforting feeling of tradition and allows one to become \\"more open to the panoply of sensations of the experience\\" (Rosemont 2005). But it should also maintain a healthy practice of selflessness, both in the actions themselves and in the proper example which is set for one's brothers. Approaches in the community, as well as personal approaches together demonstrate how li pervades in all things, the broad and the detailed, the good and the bad, the form and the formless. This is the complete realization of li. The rituals and practices of li are dynamic in nature. Li practices have been revised and evaluated throughout time to reflect the emerging views and beliefs found in society. Although these practices may change, which happens very slowly over time, the fundamental ideals remain at the core of li, which largely relate to social order. Li in government Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of li. Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of human beings with learning Li as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on li and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern. Confucius stressed the importance of the rites as fundamental to proper governmental leadership. In his sayings, Confucius regarded feudal lords in China that adopted the Chinese rites as being just rulers of the Central States. Contrarily, feudal lords that did not adopt these rites were considered uncivilized, not worthy of being considered Chinese or part of the Central States (Spring and Autumn Annals). Li should be practiced by all members of the society. Li also involves the superior treating the inferior with propriety and respect. As Confucius said \\"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety (Li); ministers should serve their prince with loyalty\\" (Analects, 3:19). In quotations Li is \\"one term by which the [traditional Chinese] historiographers could name all the principles of conservatism they advanced in the speeches of their characters.\\" See also * Li (neo-Confucianism) * Zhou ritual system * Á¶ÆÊ®ÇÂà∂Â∫¶ * Á¶ÆÊïô  References  Concepts in Chinese philosophy Philosophical concepts Confucian thought Principles Concepts in ethics Etiquette ","title":"Li (Confucianism)"},{"id":"6365203","title":"GMS (software)"},{"id":"6365229","text":"Don Ellis at Fillmore is a live double-LP by big band leader Don Ellis which was released in 1970.Don Ellis discography, accessed March 6, 2015 Reception Al Campbell of Allmusic said \\"This is a crazy and consistently riotous two-disc set that features the Don Ellis Orchestra at its height\\".

It is the first of the Ex's albums to feature extensive use of improvisation and instruments outside of the standard guitar/bass/drums arrangement of punk rock, as well as great numbers of international guest musicians, most notably New York's Sonic Youth, Glasgow's Dog Faced Hermans, Amsterdam's Instant Composers Pool, as well as numerous folk musicians from a variety of European and Middle Eastern traditions. The album marked a turning point in The Ex's artistry, foreshadowing many collaborations and delvings into avant-garde, experimental, improvisational, folk and world music that the band would mix with their abrasive trademark post-punk sound in the 20 years to come. Reception Dean McFarlane of Allmusic called the album the groups's \\"magnum opus\\" and it was selected as the sole highlight of The Ex's discography. He wrote that the sessions were similar to \\"the extended collages of the Crass albums, whereby the sessions were not strictly performed by the entire group, but were in fact collections of solo tapes, ad-hoc collaborations, and improvised sketches. There are plenty of full-throttle Ex avant-punk tracks, however, and collaborators include numerous players from the free improvisation world, as well as members of Sonic Youth, who contribute their parts by tape and even apparently via telephone on one piece featuring Kim Gordon.\\" He wrote that the album \\"marks a turning point in the group's sound; from this point they would embrace more fully the aesthetics and methods of avant-garde jazz, free improvisation, and delicate European folk. Over the four sides, this is an excellent introduction to the labyrinthine world of one of the most inspired and inventive groups in European post punk.\\" According to Trouser Press, the album \\"reroutes the music from its usual head-on collision and spotlights a few guests [...] While tracks like \\"Shopping Street\\" are brash cacophony, others are far more restrained.\\" Many reviewers now consider the album to be one of the band's best or as a possible starting point for unfamiliar listeners.

Record labels worldwide send their newest releases to the pool of DJs; in exchange, the pool provides feedback on each release as well as exposure in the clubs and other venues they play in. DJs typically pay a monthly subscription to join the service provided by these record pools. Music pools originated as vinyl record pools in 1974 New York City, evolved into CD distribution networks, and later online music distribution between DJs (digital pools). A music pool may have a \\"brick and mortar\\" office or may be entirely virtualized. History In the early 1970s, DJing was established as a new art form, creating a platform connecting the listener to the performance. According to David Mancuso, one of the co-founders of the first established record pool, ‚ÄúWhen the disc jockey got two turntables and was in a club using recorded music, a new menu was started because the dancer was part of the performance. You‚Äôd have your live musicians, where you‚Äôd have to go someplace and listen to them play. Or your home, where you‚Äôd sit on your couch and listen to records. Well, the disc jockeys got in-between this and created something new... Where the dancer became part of the whole setting of the music being played.‚Äù As DJing became more popular, there was a higher demand for records. However, an efficient way for DJs to obtain the newest releases from record labels was not yet established and many DJs did not have enough credibility to obtain them on their own. Record labels had trouble identifying individual DJs and their place of work, so many were turned away. Knowing this, Mancuso set up a meeting for about twenty-five local New York DJs and members of record labels to meet and discuss this recurring issue at Club Hollywood. According to Mancuso, the meeting ended in a ‚Äútotal disaster‚Äù and resulted in a screaming match between the disc jockeys and record companies. Mancuso decided to have a separate meeting with the disc jockeys alone and invited them over to The Loft, where they declared their intent regarding fair music distribution for DJs everywhere. It was then that the first record pool was started by Mancuso in concert with Steve D'Aquisto and Paul Casella in 1974 in New York City as a grassroots, non-profit effort to design an efficient pipeline for swapping information between the music industry and working DJs. It was to be known as The New York Record Pool, which disbanded a few years after its founding, due to differences regarding the operation of the company. The record pool received the newest releases directly from the record labels and distributed them to their subscribed members. In exchange, they agreed to provide the labels with feedback for each record. ‚ÄúThe disc jockeys would get the records and they‚Äôd fill out a feedback sheet; they would give the personal reaction and the floor reaction. And that information, based on the test pressings, would go back to the record company and they would adjust certain things or whatever,‚Äù Mancuso said. Largely used in the United States, the promotional pool system has never really been established outside of that country. The number of record pools peaked about 150 regional organizations during the 1980s and 1990s, but that number dropped off steadily during the shift from vinyl records to CDs then to digital formats. The broad term \\"music pool\\" eventually arose, reflecting the advancing state of music distribution technology and the shrinking number of vinyl promotional releases, shifts that have caused pools to undergo major transformations in membership and in nature. There are approximately a dozen remaining music pools in operation as of 2017, which collectively produce a monthly chart of their most popular distributed music (Published in DJ Times Magazine). Almost all remaining music pools now provide product to their members in digital format exclusively. Record pools continue on today as a modern promotional channel used by the biggest record labels around the world to target the vast amount of DJs worldwide. They also act as a tool for individual DJs to release their own productions to the record pool, assisting their careers and helping them gain exposure to the general public. They have also evolved into a business that has their own team of in-house producers, remixers, and editors that release music into the DJ community through the record pool‚Äôs networks. Many have also adapted to the modern/digital age and post regular content providing the DJ community with DJ related news and advice on how to begin a DJ career.

An amplifier and speaker at full volume can be extremely loud, posing a risk to hearing and an annoyance to neighbors, and will often drown out other instruments in a mix in live shows. In a recording studio, the sound of an amplifier at full volume may spill into the microphones for other instrumentalists. The characteristic sound of a tube guitar amplifier as heard on the majority of professional recordings is achieved by playing the amplifier at high volumes and using one or more microphones to capture the sound. Turning the volume up causes the pre- amplifier to overdrive and it drives the power amplifier into distortion and the loudspeaker to \\"break up\\", adding intentional distortion to the amplified tone. Sizes and types A guitar speaker isolation cabinet has a built-in mounting baffle for a guitar speaker and a permanently mounted microphone clip. A compact isolation cabinet contains a small guitar speaker such as 6¬Ω\\" diameter and sometimes an attached power attenuator to prevent blowing the speaker. A guitar speaker isolation box is large enough to contain a standard guitar speaker cabinet such as a 1x12\\", 2x12\\" or 4x12\\" cabinet and a couple of compact microphone stands. Inexpensive but less effective DIY implementations of this approach are to put a guitar speaker and microphone in a closet, place gobo partitions around a speaker cabinet to somewhat deflect the sound, or form a tent with multiple layers of heavy blankets over a guitar speaker cabinet and microphone. An isolation booth is a small room large enough to contain a single performer along with a rig, enabling the instrument to interact with the amplifier while isolating the rest of the band from the extreme volume. Finally, the live room of a recording studio provides sound isolation between an entire band and the control room, allowing the studio engineers to work at manageable volumes and prevent listener fatigue. The frequency response of an isolation system depends on the number of microphones, the type of microphones, microphone positioning, cabinet dimensions, speaker size, speaker model, and the amount of sound-absorption material inside the isolation cabinet. To control the resulting response, a dedicated equalizer can be used to enhance or reduce specific frequency ranges. The small volume of an isolation cabinet does not produce audible room reverberation, so the sound generally has to be enhanced with an electronic reverb. Degree of sound isolation A single-layer isolation cabinet or isolation box reduces the sound but does not make the speaker silent; significant bass leaks out. A double-layer box with dead space between the layers still leaks audible bass, if typical plywood thickness is used. Getting closer to silencing would require two very massive layers of plywood, MDF board, or soundproofing board such as Homasote or Wonderboard. An additional layer may be needed, such as for a 100-watt guitar amp with multiple efficient guitar speakers inside the box. Combined approaches To reduce the volume leakage or to prevent blowing the speaker or microphone, a power attenuator is sometimes used between the tube power amp and the guitar speaker in the isolation box. This reduces the power delivered to the speaker and thus the volume, but has some effect on speaker and microphone response. To reduce volume on stage while staying near to a traditional guitar amp setup, a guitar amp can drive two parallel loads: a power attenuator driving a conventional guitar speaker cabinet (with no microphone), and a speaker isolation cabinet providing the signal for the mixer board and sound reinforcement system. A speaker isolation cabinet can be combined with a Direct Inject signal. A DI signal is run from the guitar amplifier or from a guitar amp power attenuator to one channel of the mixing console. A miked guitar speaker in an isolation cabinet is run into another channel of the mixing console. The DI signal and miked guitar speaker can then be selectively blended, with the DI providing a more immediate, present, bright sound, and the microphone and guitar speaker providing a colored, distant, darker sound. Over stressing components Blowing a speaker is a significant possibility when using an isolation cabinet. A blown speaker usually has a broken wire in the coil and would need to be reconed. A blown speaker appears as an open or infinite resistance to the tube power amplifier and can \\"fry\\" expensive components in the amp, such as the output transformer or power tubes, which would then need to be replaced. \\"Cranking an amp\\" means turning up a guitar power amplifier well into the region at which power-tube distortion is produced, generating as much as twice the amplifier's rated non-distorting wattage. Pushing a guitar amp to such an extent can destroy components of an amplifier whether using an isolation cabinet, dummy load, power attenuator, or conventional guitar speaker cabinet. In particular, tubes wear more quickly when they are consistently pushed into saturation.

The range was primarily available in other big-size and mid-size trucks. Name origin is Condor family of birds Condor from. Most mid-size and big-size models of the truck are distinguishable by a front 'Condor' badge, but the common Nissan Diesel or UD badge is usually used on the rear. In the United States, where it is sold as an UD, its principal competitors are Bering MD, Mitsubishi Fuso FK, Chevrolet W-Series, GMC W-Series, and the Isuzu F-Series. Its Japanese market competitors are Mitsubishi Fuso Fighter, Isuzu Forward, and Hino Ranger. In 2011 a new generation Condor MK/LK was introduced, and from now on the UD name is used in all markets, rather than Nissan Diesel. First Generation (1975‚Äì1983) The first Condor appeared in 1975. Two types of engine ED6 (a swirl chamber) and FD6T (a direct injection, with turbo). Turbo engine car is referred to as the \\"Condor GF\\", it had been standard equipped with power steering and cooler. At the same time, medium-sized to share a part of the power train and chassis bus RM90 have also been announced. In 1979 it minor changed from ED6 to FD6, from an emissions regulations, cab design is also changed. In 1981, it changed to new \\"NISSAN DIESEL\\" emblem in the front part is changed. The Condor 6 of 6t product class was also released. Engraved \\"UD\\" was found in the center portion of the front wheel in the Condor primary. Second Generation (1983‚Äì1993) The second generation Condor launched in 1983 following emissions compliance. Changes the engine FE6 type in some improvement in 1984. In 1988, it minor changed to the front grille, with Condor S was added, and in 1989 it introduces ABS. In 1990 the first year of Heisei emissions compliance on its Condor range. In China, the Condor CM series is marketed as the Dongfeng EQ2102. In Indonesia, Condor CM series was marketed as Nissan Diesel CKA 12 H, CKA 12 BT, CKA 12 BTX, CDA 12, CDA 12 BT, CWA 12, and CWA 12 M. Second generation Nissan Diesel Condor In the United States, this generation was sold as the UD 1800-3300 but it was also imported by Navistar International and sold as the International Model 400, 500, 600, 700, and 900. The smallest Model 400 was a Class 5 truck with a GVW and Nissan Diesel engines of . The heaviest Model 900, a Class 7 truck, corresponds to the UD 3300. Third Generation (1993‚Äì2011) In 1993, the third generation of the Condor range was introduced as the Fine Condor, and in 1994 it added 4WD package. Minor changes included exhaust emission regulations in 1994 and in 1995 the Condor SS ultra-lightweight specifications was added. In addition, the CNG vehicles on its Condor range, and soon after, in 1997 it added PW (with 10 tons) and a short cab Condor Z, does similar to Condor S is out of print and accordingly. Also the same year, It adopted a shock absorbing steering. Low-floor 4WD was also added. From a 1998 exhaust emission regulations in 1999 other than 10-ton Condor PW. On 26 January 2000, the Allison 5-speed steel automatic transmission and setting the vehicles added in the Condor range. On 15 March, the MK series features a carbon fiber composite material using a wing body and set the vehicle. Weight of 250 kg is attained as compared with the conventional aluminum wing vehicle and achieve maximum loading capacity 4000 kg. It minor change came in May 2000, Previously adopted the inverted trapezoidal large front grille, which is employed in the CNG vehicles, car design has also been renewed. In addition to the wide-cabin vehicles, new standard cabin vehicle is added, ABS and driver's seat SRS on all models the air bag is equipped. In May 2004, the Hino J07E / J08E change to the engine in order to meet 2003 exhaust emission regulations, CI was also changed. On 7 April 2006, As an option the 5-speed automatic transmission in the cargo system, garbage disposal system of CNG vehicles to be equipped with a J08C type engine. In June 2008, it improved a medium-sized license corresponding the GVW 11-ton truck was added. Fourth generation (2010‚Äì2017) In April 2010, it preceding of the original third generation announced the development of the 8 ton class model PK series from the fourth generation, following name its change to UD Trucks in February 2010. It was introduced in Japan, it plans to sell in the US and other markets. On 23 August 2010, the 9-ton PK series and 12-ton PW series were introduced while other models continue selling the third generation. The majority of the cab of the parts, the engine of development and production house GH7 engine is equipped. The first time adopted the urea SCR system to Quon the \\"FLENDS (Friends)\\" in Condor, NOx is reduced. At the same time, comply with the post- new long-term exhaust gas regulations. Car name font has also been redesigned to the same design \\"Condor\\" and Quon. On November 22 the new 8-ton PK series is added. In July 2011 it upgraded MK series, with a 5 and 6 tons class and LK 4 ton class trucks equipped with the GH5 and GH7 engines. Fifth generation (2017-present) In 28 July 2017, as part of its transition from UD Trucks to Isuzu, with the fifth generation Condor is now rebadged version of the Isuzu Forward shared with different UD Trucks front fascia and new cab.

In a dramatic fashion, foreign agents and G-Men try to seize the inventions for themselves. A 78-minute feature film version of the film, cut down from the serial's original 265 minutes, was released for television showing in 1949. It was the 112th serial released by Universal Pictures and the 44th to have sound. The serial stars Lugosi as the villainous Doctor Zorka with Dorothy Arnold and Robert Kent. It was adapted in DC's Movie Comics #6, cover date September‚ÄìOctober 1939, the final issue of that title. Plot Dr. Zorka, a rogue scientist, is the creator of various weapons of warfare, including a devisualizer belt which renders him invisible; an eight-foot tall slave robot (Ed Wolff), robot spiders that can destroy life or paralyse it and he also has a deadly meteorite fragment from which he extracts an element which can induce suspended animation in an entire army. Foreign spies, operating under the guise of a foreign language school, are trying to buy or mostly steal the meteorite element, while his former partner, Dr. Fred Mallory, miffed that Zorka will not turn his inventions over to the U.S. Government, blows the whistle on him to Captain Bob West of the Military Intelligence Department. Tired of answering the door and saying no to the spies and the government, Zorka moves his lab. When his beloved wife is killed, Zorka, puttering around for his own amusement up to this point, is crushed and swears eternal vengeance against anyone trying to use his creations and to make himself world dictator. And would have if not for his assistant Monk, an escaped convict virtually enslaved by Zorka, who is cowardly, treacherous and totally incompetent, and whose accidental or deliberate interference with Zorka's efforts repeatedly frustrates his master's own plans...

Stock footage was used from The Invisible Ray, including scenes of Dr. Zorka finding the meteorite in Africa. As with several Universal serials, some of the stock music came from Frankenstein. The Phantom Creeps' car chase was itself used as stock footage in later serials. Newsreel shots of the Hindenburg disaster were used as part of Dr. Zorka's final spree of destruction after his robot, which is supposed to destroy the human race, is stopped due to the sabotage by the Monk after being unleashed. Universal tried to improve their serials by eliminating the written foreword at the start of each chapter. This led to The Phantom Creeps being the first serial in which the studio used vertically scrolling text as the foreword. Influence The innovation of the scrolling text version of the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter was used for the Star Wars films as the \\"Star Wars opening crawl\\". The Rob Zombie song \\"Meet the Creeper\\" is based on this movie. Zombie has used robots and props based on the design of The Robot in several music videos and live shows. The character Murray The Robot in Zombie's animated movie The Haunted World of El Superbeasto is also based on The Robot. The Robot also appears on the album cover for the single \\"Dragula\\".

Born in Maine, he re-located to the Oregon Country in 1843 to establish a store in Oregon City. Later that year he paid $50 for half of a land claim on which he and Asa Lovejoy laid out a town named Portland after the port city in Pettygrove's home state. Lovejoy preferred Boston, but Pettygrove won a coin toss giving him the right to choose the name. Teamed with Benjamin Stark, who bought Lovejoy's half-interest in the town site in 1845, Pettygrove engaged in a highly profitable three-cornered trade between Portland, San Francisco, and Hawaii. Making money in his stores and warehouses, in trades of lumber, grain, and salted fish, and in real-estate deals, Pettygrove by 1848 was one of the richest men in the Oregon Territory. When the California Gold Rush drew potential laborers from Oregon and threatened Pettygrove's short-term prospects, he sold his assets in Portland and vicinity. In 1851 he joined with others to start a new town, Port Townsend, on Puget Sound in what became the U.S. state of Washington. He died at the age of 75 and was buried in Port Townsend. Pettygrove was married to Sophia Roland, with whom he had at least two children, one of whom was named after Benjamin Stark. While living in Oregon, he belonged to the Pioneer Lyceum and Literary Club of Oregon City and served as jury foreman in a trial there related to the Cayuse War. Pettygrove Park in southwest Portland and Pettygrove Street in northwest Portland are named after him. Early life Pettygrove was born in Calais, Maine.Corning, pp. 195‚Äì96 Educated in Maine schools, he worked as a merchant's clerk in New York City before a company there sent him by ship in 1842 to Oregon City to open a store. Oregon City was then part of what was known as the Oregon Country, part of the Pacific Northwest. He and his wife, their child, as well as Pettygrove's sister Mary Charlotte Foster, her husband Philip Foster, and their four children, traveling on the Victoria, an A.G. & A.W. Benson vessel, reached their destination in 1843. Stopping first in Vancouver, Pettygrove arranged with the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) for a schooner to take his store goods up the Willamette River to Oregon City. There Pettygrove established the agreed-upon store in partnership with George Abernethy. After building a warehouse in Oregon City, Pettygrove began trading in fur and wheat. Oregon Francis Pettygrove (center) and others In 1843, Pettygrove paid $50 for of land owned by William Overton. The tract was along the Willamette River in a place known as The Clearing, downstream of Oregon City. Pettygrove and Asa Lovejoy, who owned adjoining land, decided to create a town on part of the site. Strongly encouraged by John Couch, a sea captain who considered The Clearing a good site for a river port, they hired Thomas A. Brown in 1845 to plat the town. Brown and his assistant, James Terwilliger, a blacksmith, laid the town out more compactly than usual on a grid of 16 square blocks, to a side. They allowed public rights-of-way for north‚Äìsouth streets, rights-of-way for east‚Äìwest streets, and no alleys. The short blocks and small rights-of-way created more corner lots than usual and reduced the amount of stump removal needed to create streets. A proliferation of stumps on unbuilt lots prompted a derisive nickname for the place, Little Stump Town. 130px Lovejoy and Pettygrove, who could not agree on a name for the town, held a best-two-of- three coin toss won by Pettygrove, who named the town after Portland, Maine. Had Lovejoy won, he would have named it after Boston, Massachusetts.MacColl, Merchants, pp. 7‚Äì14 The two men cleared trees and debris from the site. Pettygrove built a small log store near the river, hired a married couple to run it, and commissioned the building of a wharf.Lansing, pp. 6‚Äì10 He also acquired a granary and boat landing at Champoeg, site of the Oregon Country's first provisional government. In late 1845, Lovejoy sold his half-interest in the townsite (and his half-interest in a cattle herd he owned jointly with Pettygrove) to Benjamin Stark, who was the agent in charge of merchandise being shipped from Benson & Company, Pettygrove's supplier in New York, to Pettygrove's warehouse in Portland. Stark, the supercargo (cargo supervisor), arrived in Portland on Captain Nathaniel Crosby's Toulon. The three men then arranged to have Stark act as Pettygrove's supercargo on the Toulon, trading lumber, wheat, salted fish, and other goods between San Francisco, Honolulu, and Portland. Adding a second ship, the Mariposa, for a short time they controlled much of the trade in and out of Oregon. The two men engaged in projects by land as well as sea. Among these were construction of a wagon road on the east side of the Willamette between Portland and Oregon City and a wagon track along an route, surveyed by Brown, between Portland and the farmlands of the Tualatin Plains to the west. To increase profits from cattle, Pettygrove built a slaughterhouse along the river and sold hides to Daniel H. Lownsdale, who had opened the first tannery on the Pacific Coast on a tract just west of the town site. Fiercely competitive, Pettygrove and Stark drove others, including Couch, who had his own store in Oregon City, out of business by monopolizing trade between Portland and Hawaii, charging high rates to import goods for others and raising the price of imported salt to gain control of the salmon trade. In 1847, after the United States and the United Kingdom had negotiated a boundary treaty dividing the Oregon Country between them, thousands of pioneers entered the Oregon Territory, the part of the Oregon Country ceded to the U.S., most of them settling in the Willamette Valley. Meanwhile, after an apparent disagreement with Pettygrove, Stark returned temporarily to New England, and Pettygrove took control of the entire town site. By 1848, Pettygrove \\"was one of the wealthiest residents of the territory\\".MacColl, Merchants, p. 11 In July 1849 at Portland, he buy ship Morning Star to French Jean-Baptiste Duchesne. During that year, the California Gold Rush attracted so many men from Oregon that it caused an Oregon labor shortage. Seeing little hope of further short-term growth in Portland, Pettygrove began selling his assets. While Stark was out of town, Pettygrove sold the entire townsite, including Stark's share, to Daniel H. Lownsdale for $5,000 worth of leather. This netted Pettygrove a one- hundredfold profit for his original $50 investment. Washington In 1851, Pettygrove and L.B. Hastings, another businessman, decided to establish a new town on the west side of the entrance to Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. Scouting the area for a likely spot, they met Alfred A. Plummer and Charles Bachelder, who had filed land claims near a bay on the northeastern corner of the Olympic Peninsula. After the four agreed to found a city on this site, Pettygrove and Hastings returned to Oregon for their families and other settlers and returned to what became Port Townsend. Pettygrove died there in 1887 and is buried in Laurel Grove Cemetery. Other interests, legacy Pettygrove married Sophia Roland in 1842. By 1845 they had two children, the first of whom had been born in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands), where they stopped on the way to Oregon.Lansing, p. 487 The second child, named Benjamin Stark Pettygrove, was the first boy of European descent born in Portland. Pettygrove was a member of the Pioneer Lyceum and Literary Club in Oregon City. In May 1850, he was the jury foreman in the Oregon City trial and subsequent hanging of five men from the Cayuse tribe of Native Americans who were accused of murder committed during the Cayuse War.Lansing, p. 491 Lovejoy and Pettygrove used a copper Matron Head penny, dated 1835, in their coin flip to determine Portland's name. Pettygrove bequeathed this penny to the Oregon Historical Society in his will. Pettygrove Park, an tract in downtown Portland, is named for him. It is one of two nearly adjacent parks developed in the 1960s in an urban renewal area. The same coin that Lovejoy and Pettygrove flipped to decide who should name the city was flipped to decide which park would be Lovejoy and which would be Pettygrove.

Biography Born in Missouri, Williams grew up in Connecticut and received a degree in history from Duke University, where he directed the student-run jazz big band, known as the Duke Ambassadors, from 1959 to 1961. Since music was always his first love, he went on to Columbia University to study music composition and conducting, where his passion became his profession. He quickly became busy as an arranger in New York; he moved to California in 1968 to pursue work in the movie and television field while continuing to write and arrange jazz albums. Williams was also a leader in the music-education field for many years. He served as the Artistic Director of the Henry Mancini Institute ‚Äî one of the nation's premier training programs for young musicians seeking professional careers in music ‚Äî for five years. He was Visiting Professor and Composer-in-Residence at the University of Utah and the University of Colorado, which awarded him an honorary doctorate. He also held an honorary doctorate from Duke University and performed and/or lectured at such other institutions as the Berklee College of Music, Indiana University, Texas Christian University, UCLA, USC, and Yale University. Career Williams scored more than 200 films, including Breaking Away, for which he received a 1980 Oscar nomination; All of Me, Swing Shift, Cuba, and The Grass Harp. On television, his music accompanied Columbo, Lou Grant, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Bob Newhart Show, The Streets of San Francisco, and The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd. His jazz-funk arrangement of the Beatles' \\"Get Back\\" was used as the longtime theme for the 1970s sports quiz show Sports Challenge, emceed by Dick Enberg. For clarinetist Eddie Daniels, Williams wrote A Concerto in Swing; for saxophonist Tom Scott, he penned Romances for Jazz Soloist and Orchestra. His Theme For Earth Day was recorded by John Williams and the Boston Pops. An American Concerto, composed in 1976, was one of the first successful attempts to combine jazz elements with traditional symphonic writing. In addition to An American Concerto his compositions include Gulliver, Romances, Earth Day, Adagio, and August, as well as Suite Memories for trombone and symphony orchestra, which won a 1986 Grammy; Spring Wings, a double concerto for piano and saxophone and symphony orchestra; Appalachian Morning, recorded by the Boston Pops; Memento Mei for solo soprano and orchestra; The Prayer of St. Francis for flute and strings; and others. Another of Williams' accomplishments was the 1986 orchestral work Gulliver. He spent eight months writing the work, which was recorded by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, with narration by Larry Gelbart (based on Jonathon Swift's writings) read by John Gielgud. For the concert premier, Williams conducted the Yale Philharmonic with Tony Randall narrating. In 1992, Frank Sinatra approached Williams about conducting, producing and arranging the Duets albums. Williams agreed and went on to conduct and re-arrange both Duets and Duets II in 1994. Williams often referred to this as one of the fondest accomplishments of his entire career. This was not the first time Williams had worked with Sinatra, however. In the 1980s the two had worked together on concert arrangements, Williams recalled writing an uptempo version of \\"September in the Rain.\\" In 2016, Deana Martin, daughter of Dean Martin, recorded a new swing album, which Williams scored and conducted. He also wrote five songs for the album: \\"52nd & Broadway,\\" co-written with Gail Kantor, \\"I've Been Around,\\" \\"Hearing Ella Sing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGood Things Grow,‚Äù co-written with Arthur Hamilton and ‚ÄúI Know What You Are‚Äù co-written with Will Jennings. The album Swing Street was released in 2016. Williams was contracted frequently by the major labels, however he always managed to find time to share his talents with up and comers he believed in. In 2013, Williams produced and arranged two singles for 23 year-old vocalist James DeFrances. The premise was Big Band, swing covers of current pop songs, similar to what Williams had done for Paul Anka on 2005's Rock Swings album. DeFrances and Williams subsequently created their covers of Call Me Maybe and Suit & Tie. These sessions marked a reunion of the Frank Sinatra Duet's orchestra and production staff at Capitol Records for the first time since 1994. Al Schmitt engineered these sessions and setup a Neumann U47 microphone previously owned by Frank Sinatra to add to the nostalgia. Williams daughter Greer acted as creative director for this project. Awards and honors Nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for composing the orchestral work An American Concerto, he won two Grammys for his jazz arrangements, four Emmys for his television music, an Oscar nomination for film composition, and the Richard Kirk Award from BMI. In addition to Williams' 4 Emmy wins, he received 23 nominations. For his 2015 album Home Suite Home, Williams earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. Several of Williams' recordings are considered contemporary big-band standards, including Threshold, which won a 1974 Grammy; Too Hip for the Room, a Grammy nominee in 1983; Tenth Avenue, a double Grammy nominee in 1987; and Sinatraland, a tribute to the singer which was Grammy- nominated in 1998. Williams received 16 Grammy nominations for his compositions and arrangements. Death Williams died of cancer in Santa Monica, California on July 25, 2018 at the age of 79.Patrick Williams, Emmy- Winning TV Composer, Dies at 79 Reception Respected music critic Gene Lees was quoted as saying: \\"His An American Concerto is, in my opinion, the best mixture of jazz and classical that anybody has ever done. Pat's writing is breathtaking. He's just one of the finest arrangers and composers who ever put pen to paper.\\" Daniel Cariaga wrote in the Los Angeles Times: \\" An American Concerto must be one of the most attractive, affecting and original of jazz- symphonic meldings. The style is unrestrained, the tunes ingratiating, the writing expert. What Williams owes to the fair influences of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky and Rachmaninoff seems no more and no less than other living composers may owe in those directions. What sets him a cut above others is the individual integration he has achieved out of those influences.\\" Film credits *Passion's Way (1999): Sela Ward, Timothy Dalton, Alicia Witt; Robert Allan Ackerman, Dir. *Kiss the Sky (1998), MGM: William Petersen, Gary Cole, Sheryl Lee; Roger Young, Dir. *Julian Po (1997), New Line Cinema: Christian Slater, Robin Tunney; Alan Wade, Dir. *That Old Feeling (1997), Universal: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina; Carl Reiner, Dir. *Stormchasers (1995): Greg MacGillivray, Dir. *The Grass Harp (1995), New Line Cinema: Walter Matthau, Piper Laurie, Sissy Spacek; Charles Matthau, Dir. *Big Girls Don't Cry...
