The pedestal is long and wide at the 100 fathom line (-185 m), while the base measures 130 km by 80 km at -4200 m. Surrounding the pedestal is a much larger mid-basin swell known as the Bermuda Rise, measuring 900 km by 600 km at the 5000 m depth contour. The islands of Bermuda are located on the southeastern margin of the Bermuda Pedestal. The oceanic crust surrounding the Bermuda is about 120 Ma, while the initial uplift of the Bermuda Rise occurred in the Middle to Late Eocene. Erosion continued from that time until the Early Oligocene. Volcaniclastic deposition and erosion ended with subsidence below sea level in the Late Oligocene. Volcanic basement is at -75 m across the platform, and -50 m on the island, except for a highpoint near Castle Harbour, at -15 m. These volcanics consist of tholeiitic lavas and intrusive lamprophyric sheets. Scientists have long considered the Bermuda Pedestal to be the remains of a large extinct shield volcano that formed between 45 and 35 million years ago. A number of theories have been established to explain the origin of the Bermuda Pedestal. According to one of these theories, it was formed by the volcanic activity of the Bermuda hotspot. In contrast, Peter R. Vogt and Woo-Yeol Jung propose instead that the Bermuda Pedestal possibly formed as a result of a worldwide reorganization of the Earth's tectonic plates due to the closing of the Tethys Ocean when the Indian subcontinent collided with Eurasia. The size of the Bermuda Pedestal combined with knowledge of other mid-ocean volcanoes tells us that the Bermuda volcano originally reached above sea level and that it took three to ten million years to reduce it to sea level.

Their films were characterized by a high standard of literature and excellent artistic preparation.  Road to foundation  In 1916, the Corvin Film Studio was founded by Dr. Jen≈ë Janovics, an influential Hungarian media entrepreneur; director of the Hungarian National Theater of Kolozsv√°r. The place of incorporation was in the city of Kolozsv√°r (Cluj, in Romanian; Clausenburg in German) the so called capital of Transylvania. By this time, Janovics ‚Äìwho was rightly called the creator of Hollywood in Transylvania‚Äì already had serious film experiences. In 1913, he made the first Transylvanian film, The Yellow Foal (S√°rga csik√≥) in co-production with the Parisian Path√© Film Studio. The film became blockbuster with noisy success on all five continents. In 1914, he formed a joint venture with Projectograph, Hungary 's leading filmmaker, under the name Proja (Projectograph & Janovics). He had been working there among others with Michael Curtiz (Kert√©sz Mih√°ly) the future Academy Awards director, the famous The Exile (A tolonc) silent film was made by them.  Foundation in Kolozsv√°r, 1916  In 1916, Janovics became independent of Projectograph setting up his new Corvin Film Studio in Kolozsv√°r. The company's name was a reference to the great 15th Century Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus.Kulik p.16 Janovics's production program concentrated largely on adaptations of popular and classic Hungarian literature. The young Alexander Korda (Korda S√°ndor) was discovered for Corvin by Janovics who brought him to his new film studio from Budapest in 1916.  Foundation in Budapest, 1917  An increasingly dominant presence at the company was the young film director Korda who joined Corvin as a leading director. Korda directed there White Nights, one of the first Hungarian films to be shown outside the country.Kulik p.17 Next year Janovics sold the company to Korda and Mikl√≥s P√°sztory. They exclusively contracted several stars of the age, including Arthur Somlay, Oszk√°r Beregi and Mih√°ly V√°rkonyi. Korda's wife, actress Mar√≠a Corda starred in several Corvin productions too. Korda and P√°sztory expanded into the Hungarian capital in the same year. On October 16, 1917, with a registered capital of one million korona, the Corvin Film Factory and Film Trade Co. was established even in Budapest. For more than 100 years, this film studio became the emblematic site of Hungarian film productions. It still works at the same place. The boom caused by World War I had a positive impact on Corvin Film. The film import ban boosted domestic demand for Hungarian films. Corvin's registered capital was increased to two and a half million korona in 1918 and then to eight million korona in 1919.  Way to talkies  In 1919 Korda became a member of the Communist Directorate of Soviet Republic as the director of film productions, so after defeating the red terror, he had to flee Hungary. Subsequently, due to the dumping of American films, Hungarian films were increasingly overshadowed, with fewer and fewer films turning in the Corvin studio, and then, in 1922, the Corvin Film temporarily ceased production of films. In 1923, the factory was modernized and reorganized to become the third largest studio in Central Europe, with a height of 18 meters and a floor area of 4x20 meters. However, as the economic conditions worsened, the factory went bankrupt in 1926. It was acquired by the Filmipari Alap in 1927Cunningham p.28 and later became one of the trustees of the future world-famous Hungarian talkies under the name Hunnia Filmgy√°r.

It is the sequel of the high-grossing film Benvenuti al Sud. It also obtained a great commercial success, gaining more than 27 million euros during its Italian theatrical release; it had the third best opening in Italian market history. Plot While Alberto is back in his beloved northern Italy in Milan, his friend Mattia is still in Naples with his friends. He has problems with his wife Maria, because she wants him to take his postal job seriously, now that the two have a son to look after. Then after a dispute, Mattia decides to transfer to northern Italy, in the town of Pordenone. Mattia appears to be willing to leave his little town, but as soon as the transfer comes through, he begins to despair. Many locals offer their opinions; his wise old mother tells him that the people in northern Italy are terribly cold and cruel. Mattia is slightly reassured and in the blink of an eye is in Milan, a whole new world for him as a citizen of the South. Alberto welcomes him very coldly because he is in big trouble. The director of Milan's largest postal company intends to provide Italy with a whole new economic plan from Japan to modify the postal service. Mattia starts working in the post office where Alberto is the deputy director, but he soon realizes how different the local mentality is: people are not like that back home. Much like Benvenuti al Sud, this film ironically jokes about the differences and diversity from the South to the North of Italy, occasionally challenging and often confirming these stereotypes.

Located in Freiburg, Germany, The Institute performs applied scientific and engineering research and development for all areas of solar energy. Fraunhofer ISE has three external branches in Germany which carry out work on solar cell and semiconductor material development: the Laboratory and Service Center (LSC) in Gelsenkirchen, the Technology Center of Semiconductor Materials (THM) in Freiberg, and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (CSP) in Halle. Since 2006, Prof. Dr. Eicke R. Weber is the director of Fraunhofer ISE. With over 1,100 employees, Fraunhofer ISE is the largest institute for applied solar energy research in Europe. The 2012 Operational Budget including investments is 74.3 million euro. History Fraunhofer ISE was founded in 1981 by Prof. Adolf Goetzberger in Freiburg, Germany. It was the first non-university establishment for applied solar energy research in Europe. The first areas of focus were the fluorescent collector FLUKO, transparent insulation and the initial steps towards high efficiency silicon and III-V solar cells, silicon thin film solar cells and material research. Already in 1983, the first fully electronic so-called \\"ISE inverter\\" was developed for use in autonomous photovoltaic systems. In 1986, the first serial product using fluorescent collectors as a power supply was produced. Within the PV small device program, numerous other successful products were developed. When the clean room was put into operation in 1989, the production of high efficiency solar cells began. In 1998, selective solar absorber coatings, which were developed at Fraunhofer ISE for solar thermal collectors, were put into industrial-scale production. In 2011 Fraunhofer ISE celebrated its 30th anniversary. Since its founding, the scientists have received many prestigious prizes and awards for their research results in the field. Research and development The solar energy research at Fraunhofer ISE establishes the technical prerequisites for an efficient and environmentally friendly energy supply for industrial as well as threshold and developing countries. The institute is committed to moving away from fossil fuels and nuclear power and moving towards a 100% renewable energy supply with the aim of providing affordable solutions for the energy transformation. To this purpose, the institute develops materials, components, systems and processes for basic research and beyond. The areas of expertise include the development of production techniques and prototypes, setting up and monitoring demonstration systems and operating indoor and outdoor testing and calibration centers. The various areas of research at Fraunhofer ISE are categorized into the following business areas: Energy Efficient Buildings At Fraunhofer ISE, energy-efficient buildings are one of the main areas of research. Teaming up with architects, expert planners and the industry, the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE optimize the performance of existing building and develop the buildings of tomorrow with consideration to the economic aspects, the energy efficiency and the user comfort. Through its involvement in the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Institute contributes in the establishment of the international boundary conditions for the realization of these concepts. In this business area, many disciplines come together: from material research and coating development through to component and system development and finally the required tests. Applied Optics and functional Surfaces Solar energy systems convert solar radiation incident on the earth into thermal, electrical or chemical energy. In order to better transmit, reflect, absorb, filter, redirect or concentrate the incoming radiation, Fraunhofer ISE develops optical components and systems. This business area serves as an interdisciplinary field and serves many areas of solar technology: windows and facades, solar thermal collectors, concentrator systems for photovoltaics and solar power plants as well as photovoltaic module technology. Solar Thermal Systems This business area covers the markets of low and high temperature applications. Solar thermal collectors and collector systems with flat or evacuated tube collectors find numerous applications in the practice. These include process water and solar heating systems, cooling and ventilation systems and sea water desalination systems. Also fa√ßade-integrated collectors are implemented. With linear concentrating collectors, operating temperatures from 150 ¬∞C to over 400 ¬∞C are achieved. Both trough and parabolic collectors are not only used for solar thermal power production in large power plants, but also in simpler and more cost-effective plants for the production of process heat, process steam and driving heat for absorption chillers. Silicon Photovoltaics Especially due to the market introduction programs in Japan and Germany, the role of photovoltaics is gaining more and more on importance. More than 85% of the solar cells produced worldwide are based on crystalline silicon. The price-performance ratio, long-term stability and the cost-reduction potential indicate that this top performer in the terrestrial photovoltaic market will retain its place as market leader longer than just the next decade. Fraunhofer ISE's expertise ranges over the entire value chain of crystalline silicon photovoltaics, starting from material development and crystallization, through to solar cell processing and photovoltaic module technology. Photovoltaic Modules and Systems Module technology converts solar cells into a robust product for reliable operation in PV power plants. Fraunhofer ISE supports the product development concentrating on increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and achieving the highest reliability. Over and above, the Institute offers its services for quality assurance of modules and power plants. Alternative Photovoltaic Technologies In addition to silicon photovoltaics, the solar cell research at Fraunhofer ISE also extends to other photovoltaic technologies: With III-V based semiconductors like gallium indium phosphide, aluminum gallium arsenide or gallium arsenide, the highest efficiencies can be reached today. The technology of the dye solar cells has developed well beyond the laboratory stage and organic solar cells are attractive especially due to the expected low manufacturing costs. Renewable Power Supply The construction of grid-connected systems is the largest market for the photovoltaic branch today. The Institute provides consultancy services for system planning, characterizes solar modules and carries out the technical analysis and performance testing of photovoltaic systems. Off-grid power supplies also are a focus of the ongoing research at the institute. People living in remote rural areas, the countless number of telecommunication systems, environmental measurement technology as well as portable electronic devices require an autonomous power supply, independent of the grid. Fraunhofer ISE develops renewable energy systems for this purpose. Fraunhofer ISE also performs research in the area of power electronics and controls. This includes inverter development and testing in a modern power electronics laboratory as well as research in the field of energy management including smart metering and smart grids. In future, vehicles will run partly or completely on electricity and draw their energy from the grid (electric and plug-in). Fraunhofer ISE is working at the interface between the vehicles and the grid on concepts for an environmentally acceptable power supply and the optimal integration of the vehicles into the electricity grid, including metering and billing systems. Hydrogen Technology In a fuel cell, hydrogen reacts with oxygen and sets useful energy free in the form of electricity and heat. Since hydrogen does not exist in its pure form in nature, it must be produced from one of its many chemical compounds. At Fraunhofer ISE in the area of hydrogen technology, the research focuses on innovative technologies for hydrogen generation and on processes for the highly efficient conversion of hydrogen into electricity and heat using the most modern equipment. Together with partners from industry and science, components and complete fuel cell systems are developed for autonomous, portable as well as mobile applications. Service Units Presently the following certified test labs provide testing and calibration services at the laboratories: * TestLab Solar Thermal Systems * TestLab Solar Facades * TestLab PV Modules * CalLab PV Cells * CalLab PV Modules Other service establishments at the laboratories are: * Quality Assurance of PV Power Plants * Photovoltaic Power Electronics * Inverter Laboratory * Battery Testing Laboratory * Lighting Laboratory * Laboratory for Vapour Compression Heat Pumps * Phase Change Materials (PCM) Laboratory * Testing Laboratory for Adsorption Materials and Porous Materials * TestLab Fuel Cells Cooperation The Institute is one of the founding members and the Member-in-Charge of the Fraunhofer Energy Alliance, comprising sixteen Fraunhofer institutes with expertise in energy technology and energy research. The Institute is a member of the ForschungsVerbund Erneuerbare Energien (FVEE) and the European Renewable Energy Research Centres Agency (EUREC), as well as other alliances. The Institute maintains a close cooperation with the Material Research Center of the University of Freiburg, which assists the Institute with fundamental research. Th institute director holds a faculty position at that University as professor of physics and applied sciences. Spin-Offs To date, seven spin- off companies have been founded from the applied research results at Fraunhofer ISE. Among them are the following: * In 1999, PSE AG was founded to provide services and expertise on solar energy. In addition to compiling studies and reports, the company provides measurement and control technology and custom-made laboratory equipment. * In 2001, Holotools GmbH (now temicon GmbH - holotools) was founded to develop and manufacture functional surfaces for the management of light. One particular expertise, for example, is the production of large-area homogeneous microstructures for optical surfaces. * In 2002, SorTech AG (renamed Fahrenheit AG as of March 2017) was spun off to exploit heat sources for producing cold, thus using low temperature heat as an energy source instead of electricity. As a result, Fahrenheit advanced the underlying technology, adsorption cooling, and produces chillers which use residual heat from a variety of sources to economically generate cold. * Soitec Solar, founded in 2005, brought an innovative photovoltaic technology using concentrated sunlight to the market. With this technology, photovoltaic power stations from 100 kW up to several megawatts are further developed, manufactured, and installed. * In 2014, Enit Energy IT Systems GmbH was spun off to develop and market energy management systems for medium-sized enterprises. These systems help customers gain more transparency about their electricity, heat and gas consumption. In addition, the company's products enable intelligent system control and more efficient operation. Staff, Infrastructure and Financing The laboratory has a staff of 1139, of whom 439 hold permanent positions. (as of 04/2012). The research institute has a net floor area of 21,000 m¬≤ which contains offices, laboratories and test fields. New labs and office space are presently under construction. The 2011 operational budget totaled ‚Ç¨61.3 million. Just five percent of the operational budget was basic funding, 90% from German federal funds and 10% from German state funds.

While it is one of the few extant pillars that carry Ashokan edicts, it is particularly notable for containing later inscriptions attributed to the Gupta emperor Samudragupta (4th century CE). Also engraved on the stone are inscriptions by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, from the 17th century. According to some scholars, the pillar was moved from its original location and installed within Akbar's Allahabad Fort in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh by Emperor Akber himself but this theory is disputed by other scholars who point out absence of any confirmatory evidence which would indicate that the pillar was moved and rather pre mughal inscriptions indicate that it was already present in it current location. As the fort is now occupied by the Indian Army, the public are only allowed limited access to the premises and special permission is required to view the pillar. History capital of the Allahabad pillar, with lotuses framing a \\"flame palmette\\" surrounded by small rosette flowers. A quite similar frieze from Delphi incorporating lotuses with multiple calyxes. The Allahabad Pillar is a single shaft of polished sandstone standing high. It has a lower diameter of and an upper diameter of . The customary lotiform bell-shaped capital seen in the other Ashoka Pillars is lost as is whichever statue mounted it. However the abacus, adorned by a \\"graceful scroll of alternate lotus and honeysuckle\\" that the statue must have rested upon, was found nearby. Cunningham believed that the capital must have been mounted by a single lion. The abacus is almost identical to the one found on the pillar at Sankasya suggesting proximate erection dates. The ancient Ashoka Pillar at Allahabad topped with a colonial- era lion capital (photographed ). The lion capital was possibly designed by Captain Edward Smith in 1838. Ashokan pillar from Kaushambi According to the theory proposed by 19th-century archaeologists, and supported by Indian scholars such as Upinder Singh, the Allahabad pillar came from somewhere else, probably Kaushambi. The Ashokan inscriptions suggest that the pillar was first erected at Kaushambi, an ancient town some 30 miles (50 kilometers) west of its current location which was then the capital of the kingdom of Vatsa. It was moved to Allahabad much later when the region came under Muslim rule. The presence of another broken pillar at Kaushambi near the ruins of the Ghoshitarama monastery has led some to believe that the Allahabad Pillar might have been one of a pair, not unlike the ones discovered at Rampurva. The Allahabad Pillar as seen by Joseph Tiefenthaler in the 18th century The pillar has been taken down and re-erected a number of times since the 13th century. It was once re-erected during the time of Jahangir in 1605, albeit crowned by a globe surmounted by a cone, and was later sketched by the Jesuit missionary, Joseph Tiefenthaler, in the mid-18th century. General Kyd pulled the pillar down in 1798. In 1838, Captain Edward Smith \\"of the Engineers\\" set up the pillar once again, this time with a new lion capital of his own design. Cunningham criticized this effort at restoration as \\"a signal failure\\" as he thought the statue was \\"small and recumbent\\". He summed up the design with the following remark, Ashokan pillar, in-situ An alternate theory proposed by Krishnaswamy and Ghosh in 1935 states that the Allahabad pillar was never moved. They dismissed the theory that Muslim Sultans, anyone from the Mughal empire, Hindu kings before the arrival of Islam, or any private individual may have moved the pillar from Kaushambi to the current location. Their arguments are based on the dates of the numerous inscriptions on the pillar, the lack of textual evidence in any historical texts, and there was no reason for anyone to move to pillar from Kaushambi to Allahabad, since there is no evidence that these were significant cities. They also dismiss the possibility that a private individual may have moved it because the pillar is too big and heavy, and required a very large amount of resources to move it. Ashoka may have installed it at Prayag because the confluence of Ganges and Yamuna rivers was already a major pilgrimage site during his time, thus be a preferred location that gave more access and visibility to his Edicts. The Ashokan inscription is merely a copy of the Kausambi inscription, state Krishnaswamy and Ghosh. The surface damage and the addition of numerous new inscriptions happened while the pillar stood in Allahabad. pre-Ashokan, PrayƒÅga bull-pillar A third theory was proposed in 1979 by John Irwin ‚Äì a scholar of Indian Art History and Archaeology, who concurred with Krishnaswamy and Ghosh that the Allahabad pillar was never moved and was always at the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamuna. He further stated that the pillar origins were undoubtedly pre- Ashokan based on all the evidence at the site, the major and minor inscriptions as well as textual evidence, taken together. According to Irwin, an analysis of the minor inscriptions and ancient scribblings on the pillar first observed by Cunningham, also noted by Krishnaswamy and Ghosh, reveals that these included years and months, and the latter \\"always turns out to be Magha, which also gives it name to the Magh Mela\\", the bathing pilgrimage festival of the Hindus. Archaeological and geological surveys done since the 1950s, states Irwin, have revealed that the rivers ‚Äì particularly Ganges ‚Äì have a different course now than in distant past. The original path of river Ganges had settlements dating from 8th-century BCE onwards. This ancient path of the river placed the pillar more directly on the banks of the confluence. Further, east from the pillar is the remains of an ancient massive well (samudra-kup in early Sanskrit texts), in the direction of the remains of Pratisthan (now Jhusi). The Vasuki temple and Alarkapuri, which pilgrims visit after ritual bathing as a part of their traditional parikrama (circumambulation, Magha Mela walking circuit), are also ancient and consistent with early Sanskrit texts. According to Irwin, the pillar itself is pre-Buddhist to which Ashoka added the Brahmi script inscription to advertise his edicts to the masses of pilgrims and the extant Buddhist monasteries there. He adds, \\"we also know with certainty that its original emblem had been ‚Äì not a lion, as previously supposed ‚Äì but the bull of pre-Buddhist, Brahmanical religion\\". According to Karel Werner ‚Äì an Indologist known for his studies on religion particularly Buddhism, Irwin work \\"showed conclusively that the pillar did not originate at Kaushambi\\", but had been at Prayaga from pre-Buddhist time as a center of a very ancient pillar cult and that in fact, this was incorrectly attributed to Ashoka. Inscriptions When James Prinsep of the Asiatic Society came across the broken pillar just inside the gates of the Allahabad Fort in , its inscriptions were being eroded by the rain and sun. He remarked, There are three sets of inscriptions on the column from the three emperors, Ashoka Maurya, Samudragupta and Jahangir . They are accompanied by some minor inscriptions by pilgrims and others, which are derided as a mass of modern scribblings by Cunningham. Some of these are, however, dated and coupled with the style of scripts used, are useful to establish the periods when the pillar was in an erect position, and when it was lying prone on the ground. Ashoka inscriptions Major Pillar Edicts 1-6 on the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka The Ashokan inscriptions on the Allahabad Pillar (along with inscriptions elsewhere) was pivotal to the decipherment of the Brahmi script by The Asiatic Society's James Prinsep. It led to the rediscovery of the Mauryan emperor and the unearthing of the full extent of his empire. The inscription is engraved in continuous lines around the column in Brahmi and contains the same six edicts that can be seen on the other pillars. The surviving inscriptions from the Ashoka period are \\"uniform in size, neat and deeply engraved\\" observed Cunningham. =Major Pillar Edicts 1-6= The pillar contains the Major Pillar Edicts of Ashoka, from 1 to 6. The first and second edicts have survived in full. However, much of the third and fourth edicts were \\"ruthlessly destroyed by the cutting of the vain- glorious inscription of Jahangir, recording the names of his ancestors\\". Only two lines of the fifth edict have survived, others lost by surface peel off. The sixth is almost complete, with a loss of about half a line. These edits are same as found at other Ashokan pillars. Besides the six edicts, the Allahabad pillar also includes what are known as the Schism edict, the Queen's edict and the Birbal Magha Mela inscription. =Schism edict= Schism and Queen Edict inscriptions on the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka The Schism Edict, referred to as the Kaushambi edict by Cunningham, is a command from the emperor addressing the senior officials (Mahamatras) of Kaushambi urging them to avoid dissension and stay united. The following is a conflation of various fragmented versions of the edict: =Queen's edict= Similar decorative friezes can be seen at the Diamond throne of Bodh Gaya, also built by Ashoka. The Queen's Edict refers to the charitable deeds of Ashoka's queen, Karuvaki, the mother of Prince Tivala. Samudragupta inscription A later inscription, also known as the Prayag Prashasti, is attributed to the 4th century CE Gupta emperor Samudragupta, and follows immediately below the edicts of Ashoka. It is considered \\"the most important historical document of the classical Gupta age\\". It is in excellent Sanskrit, written in the more refined Gupta script (a later version of Brahmi) by the poet and minister, Harishena. The inscription is a panegyric praising Samudragupta and lists the political and military achievements of his reign including his expeditions to the south. It provides a unique snapshot of the Gupta empire and its neighbours and is the source of much of what is known of the geopolitical landscape of that era. The following is from the translation of the inscription by D. R. Bhandarkar: Earlier translations, including one by J. F. Fleet, also exist. Birbal Magh Mela inscription The Birbal Magh Mela inscription is from the second half of the 16th-century. This inscription is significant because it confirms that Prayag was a significant pilgrimage center ‚Äì Tirth Raj ‚Äì for the Hindus in the 16th-century, and that the festival was held in the month of Magha. The Samvat year 1632 is equivalent to 1575 CE, while Saka 1493 equals 1571 CE. One of these is a scribal error, but the decade is accurate because Allahabad was under Akbar's control at the time and where built a major fort. Historical documents also confirm that Birbal did visit Akbar and Allahabad often. Cunningham noted that many smaller inscriptions were added on the pillar over time. Quite many of these inscriptions include a date between 1319 CE and 1397 CE, and most of these include the month Magha. According to Krishnaswamy and Ghosh, these dates are likely related to the Magh Mela pilgrimage at Prayag, as recommended in the ancient Hindu texts. Jahangir inscription Jahangir inscription on the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka.Description and recent photograph in A still later inscription in Persian traces the ancestry of the Mughal emperor Jahangir. It was carved by Mir Abdullah Mushkin Qalam, shortly before his accession to the throne when he was still Shah Salim. The Jahangir inscription overwrote and \\"ruthlessly destroyed\\" the significant portion of the ancient Ashoka inscription, states Cunningham.

Early Life  Klein was born in Chicago in 1901. His parents were Austrian Jewish immigrants to the U.S. who relocated to Berlin during Klein's childhood. He was interned by German authorities during World War I, but escaped to France and joined the U.S. Army as a spy. Civilian career After serving as a spy in Germany in World War I, Klein began his civilian career in the 1920s as a criminal reporter for The State Herald, a Hearst Corporation newspaper in Chicago, and initiated the first German language radio broadcasts in the United States. Klein also originated the South Pacific edition of The Stars and Stripes military newspaper, unsuccessfully ran for Congressman at Large as Republican in 1932, and for the United States Senate in 1954. He wrote the screenplay, Black Cargo, during a Hollywood stint (1934‚Äì39) when Klein tried unsuccessfully to produce films on the life of General John Pershing.National Museum of American Jewish Military History, \\"Major General Julius Klein: His Life and Work,\\" Washington, D.C. Retrieved December 1, 2012.  World War II  In 1933 Klein joined the Illinois National Guard, becoming a lieutenant colonel in 1941. He formulated the Combat Public Relations plan dealing with psychological warfare and propaganda and was also stationed in the Philippines. During this time Klein also worked as a journalist for the Chicago Herald-Examiner, published his own periodical (The National Free Press) with his nephew Joseph Roos, and conducted domestic intelligence gathering and spy operations authorized by both Illinois governor Henry Horner and Colonel (later General) George C. Marshall. Over the years, Klein had built a positive relationship with German Consul Georg Gyssling, which continued up until the time that Gyssling was recalled to Germany in 1941. After the war, Klein's letter of commendation for Gyssling was one of the factors that saved Gyssling from being convicted as a Nazi war criminal.  Public service  In 1947, Julius Klein was elected the National Commander of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America. On April 4, 1948, as National Commander of the Jewish War Veterans, Klein organized an enormous show of strength for the establishment of the State of Israel in the form of a JWV parade down New York's Fifth Avenue. The parade influenced the United States to vote for the partition of Palestine and the State of Israel was born in May, 1948.

George Glover. Background John Bale writing in the 1540s had identified the Protestant Church of England as an actor in the historical struggle with the \\"false church\\" of Catholicism; and backed up his views with interpretation of the Book of Revelation. The \\"English apocalyptic\\" was exceptional in the Protestant territories, with the concept of England as an \\"elect nation\\". Orthodoxy Foxe's views became quite orthodox in the Church of England for a generation, and more: a war against Antichrist was being waged by the English people, but led by the Christian Emperor (echoing Constantine I) who was identified with Elizabeth I of England.William M. Lamont, Godly Rule: Politics and Religion 1603‚Äì60 (1969), pp. 23‚Äì4. They were then challenged within the Church of England, for example by Thomas Brightman, and from outside by John Napier in particular.Arthur H. Williamson, Scottish National Consciousness in the Age of James VI (1979), p. 32. Until the advent of Laudianism, the mixture of Foxe's historical support for the Church of England, including its bishops who were Marian martyrs, and his opposition to persecution, remained in the mainstream. Apocalyptic writings Foxe's Latin drama Christus Triumphans (1556 in Basle, with a 1551 edition in London also recorded) presaged his later theory of the history of the Christian church. It was called a com≈ìdia apocalyptica, and after 29 scenes ends on a note of anticipation and implication. The final act, of a work unfinished by design, brings the dramatisation of Revelation to the Protestant Reformation, and allegorically to the England of the time. Edmund Spenser may have drawn his own apocalyptic views and model from this work of Foxe. The later editions of Actes and Monuments contained tables, of the numerological significance of numbers connected to the Book of Revelation, and a timeline of persecution of the Church. Foxe's amillennialism Foxe was an \\"amillennial historicist\\";Lamont, Baxter, p. 14. which is not precisely the same as an amillennialist. The standard or initial position of the \\"English apocalyptic\\" was postmillennialist. Typical Tudor interpretations of the Christian millennium place it in the past; and Foxe does so. He was in the mainstream in opposing the premillennialist interpretations, typefied (somewhat later) by Arthur Dent, George Gifford and John Napier. This approach of the period is not equivalent to idealism, the essentially allegorical interpretation of the Apocalypse, as current usage of terminology might imply.

Description Situated approximately north of Yalgoo and north west of Cue. The property is approximately in area. The Wooramel River runs across the plains at the western end of the station. The country is undulating and broken with belts of saltbush and grasses. History The area was opened up in 1877 when stock were first introduced into the Upper Murchison. Mr J. R. O'Grady of Milly Milly Station and the prospector G. Woodley took stock to the area and explored the Wooramel River the O'Grady took up Byro Plains Station before later selling to the Nairn Bros. Walter Nairn used to travel about the Murchison with his father, James Nairn. Together they selected Mount Jonbert Station that was later renamed as Byro station around 1882. Walter settled in the area and remained there for 31 years before moving to Popanyinning. Gold was discovered on Byro Plain in 1890, by a prospector name Fredred who found some splendid specimens. James Nairn joined his father, Walter J. Nairn, and his brother Edward, at the station to help with its management while in his early 20s in 1897. The Nairn Bros sold 1,500 wethers and 150 bullocks from the station in 1908 to a Mr. G. J. Gooch. Edward Nairn was appointed as a justice of the peace of the Gascoyne magisterial district in 1911 while living at Byro. By 1912, the station was expecting to shear 20,000 sheep using all 8 stands in the shearing shed. W. J. Nairn sold Byro to the Darlot Bros. in 1913. The Darlots had previously owned Beringarra Station which they had bought in 1881. The Darlot brothers had also acquired nearby Billabalong Station. The Darlots intended to make many improvements and use Byro for breeding and Billabalong as a depot. Mr E. Roberts commenced as the station manager in 1913 and left nearly five years later in 1918 to take over at Dandragan Station. His replacement was Mr. J. M. Keogh. A bore was sunk at the station to secure a reliable sub-artesian supply of water for the stock in 1917. Water was struck at a depth of with water rising to of the surface. It delivered up to of water per hour. The Darlots sold 500 cows and calves from the holding in 1918. In 1922 the Darlots bought and took delivery of 15,000 wethers from the Butchers of Meeberrie and Boolathana Stations. The flock were in prime condition and at the time this was considered the largest sale of wethers in the state from a breeder to a single buyer. By 1925, Keogh was still running the property which had held 28,000 sheep and 5,200 head of cattle in 1923. Following a drought in 1924 the majority of the stock had been moved south to the Darlot's other property of Urilla. At one point in 1925 only 5,000 sheep remained on Byro. Everard Firebrace Darlot died in November 1937 leaving the surviving members of the firm, his brother Leonard Darlot and partner Norman D'Arcy, to retain ownership of the station. The station continued to produce quality wool and sold 8 bales in 1941, 106 in 1945, 102 bales in 1946, 12 bales in 1948, an astonishing 121 in 1949 and another 97 bales in 1950.

The architect of the building was Philip Stern. Built in 1919-1920, the school was used from then until 1952 for both elementary and high-school students. After the construction of James Monroe High School, the building was used as an elementary- and middle-school. The school was closed in 1980. Maury School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2007. History The school is located on in an area of Fredericksburg bounded by George, Kenmore, William and Barton streets. The site had been previously used as a potter's field and an African-American cemetery. Prior to construction, the graves were relocated to Shiloh Cemetery in Fredericksburg. The original school building was Fredericksburg High School. It consisted of one building facing George Street. An auditorium was added to the school in 1930. In 1937, the school was enlarged with the addition of James Monroe Elementary School, a separate building connected by a covered walk, and the name was changed to James Monroe High School. In 1952, when the city built a new high school, the building was renamed Matthew Fontaine Maury School and served as the city's middle school until it was closed in 1980. After the school was closed, it was used for several years by the Fredericksburg Police Academy and, later, as a homeless shelter. In 2007, the Maury School building was converted into condominia. Maury stadium Included in the Historic Places designation is the school's stadium. This stadium was built in 1935 and, despite the construction of two different high schools to replace it, James Monroe High School sports teams continue to use it for home games. On the slope between the school and the field, bleachers of stepped-concrete bleachers were built. A brick balustrade forms the edge of the spectators' area. The stadium has been called \\"the City Stadium\\". It is the largest public gathering place in Fredericksburg. It is the venue for concerts and other community events. The stadium was also home to the Fredericksburg Dog Mart. The Dog Mart began with a 1698 agreement between the village that was to become Fredericksburg and the Manahoac Indian tribe. Held each year, this event brought as many as 15,000 people to the school. Matthew Fontaine Maury The school is named for Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806‚Äì1873), a Spotsylvania County, Virginia native who was known as the \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\". Maury studied ocean currents and published the first reliable oceanographic charts. Maury was involved in the founding of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland and taught at the Virginia Military Institute. Design and construction Maury School reflects a Colonial Revival-style architecture. The school is made up of three matching buildings with 65,000 square feet of space. The first building opened in 1920 and was called Fredericksburg High School. The school was designed to serve white students in grades 7 - 12. In 1930 an auditorium and gym were added. An identical building was built in 1937 to house elementary school students and is connected by a covered walkway. The architect of the buildings was Philip Nathaniel Stern (1878‚Äì1960) of Fredericksburg, who was also architect for many of the buildings at what is now the University of Mary Washington. Historian and writer Jack D. Warren, Jr. called Maury School \\"the best example of institutional Colonial Revival architecture in Fredericksburg\\".

Biography  He was born on May 1, 1924 in Belgrade into a Jewish family. His father, Mosha Josif was a merchant representative of Italian and German industries and an amateur dramatist. His mother Sofia (born Fahri), was from a rich family from Zemun. With good knowledge of foreign languages (she was educated in a Swiss institute), she worked as a translator (she translated verses by Serbian poets to German language) and a member of the international PEN Club. Intelligentsia, such as Jovan Duƒçiƒá and Milo≈° ƒêuriƒá were collaborators and friends of her. In the Josif family music had an important place. Josif's mother played the piano, while father was especially favourable about opera. Mosha and Sofia Josif wanted their both sons, Enriko and Albert, to study music, but it was Enriko‚Äôs talent that was recognized properly. Very soon he got his first, private music teacher, composer and conductor Vladislav Grinski. In that period, Enriko Josif wrote his first compositions. After father‚Äôs death (1937) started a hard period for Enriko Josif and his family. Just before the start of the bombing of Belgrade (1941), they went to Sarajevo and afterwards moved to Italy, across Dubrovnik, Split and Korƒçula. As they were not persecuted, they stayed in Italy until 1943, when they moved to Switzerland. After the end of the war, Josif continued his schooling in Belgrade and graduated in the First Belgrade Gymnasium. He started his further studies at the University of Belgrade's School of Medicine, but he left this area very soon by entering studies of music at the Academy of Music in Belgrade. As a student of Milenko ≈Ωivkoviƒá at the Department for Composition, he graduated in 1954. In the period between 1961 and 1962 he attended specialization studies in Rome. He worked as a teacher in the Elementary music school \\"Vojislav Vuƒçkoviƒá\\" (1955‚Äì1956) and in the High music school \\"Kornelije Stankoviƒá\\" (1955‚Äì1957). He followed the work of his professor ≈Ωivkoviƒá at the Academy of Music as an assistant (from 1957) and after sudden professor‚Äôs death (1964) he came into ≈Ωivkoviƒá‚Äôs position at the Department for composition. Next year (1965) he was chosen to become a docent, and afterwards an associate (1970) and full professor (1976). He worked at the Academy of Music until retirement 1989. In the period 1967‚Äì1968 he was the president of the Composers‚Äô Association of Serbia. As an excellent intellectual, he was a corresponding member (from April 25, 1991) and a full member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (October 26, 2000). He died on March 13, 2003 in Belgrade.  Creative work  Enriko Josif wrote his first compositions as a student (Four sketches for piano, Improvization on folk theme for strings, Sonata brevis for piano, string quartet Quartetto lirico, Iseƒçak for narrator, soprano and piano four-hands, Simfoniett–∞) and his fertile creative work followed his pedagogical activities as well. Josif wrote pieces for solo- instruments, chamber, choral, orchestral music, pieces for choir and orchestra and film music. Besides from affinity for contemporary (not avant-garde) expression, he was devoted to the sound of baroque and earlier periods. That is visible in Josif‚Äôs compositional manner, but also in the titles of his several works: Sonata antica, Oratorio profano da camera, Frescobaldiana, Sinfonia ricercar. Impressionistic and national, folk musical features were also detected in his pieces. (Rustikon, Lyric symphony). Original melodic invention and specific instrumental coloring build a distinctive character of Josif‚Äôs musical language. According to the composer, distinctive melody was one of the most important features of his style. Josif identified the germ of all his musical thoughts with the terms of \\"voice\\", \\"inner singing\\" and \\"melody\\". His access to art and creation was deeply influenced by philosophical and poetical dimension, which is reflected in numerous titles of Josif‚Äôs pieces (In memory of time, O bird, do not fold your wings, Kazivanja, Dozivanja, Snoviƒëenja, Pesmena govorenja, Vatrenja, Slobodi≈°ta).  Religious- philosophical views  Extremely emotional, philosophical and spiritual Josif‚Äôs nature, particularly influenced by Fyodor Dostoyevski, Nikolai Berdyaev and Martin Buber, was reflected in his different statements. In his \\"sayings\\" (kazivanja in Serbian), Josif talked about spiritual life, his first contacts with the Bible, his relation with God and with all people around him. He was interested in Jewish issues but had no prejudices about the difference between the Old and New Testament. He saw them as a \\"magnificent, indivisible bridge\\", being enthralled by the idea of \\"embracing all people\\". He had particular reflections about suffering and passion. He even noted specific parallels between destinies of Serbian and Jewish people; inspired by such a \\"general human tragedy of an alienated man\\", he composed the scenic chronicle Death of Saint Stephen of Dechani. Although Josif refused publishing of his speeches and writings, many sources testify his attractive ideas and thoughts about his artistic and living inspiration. Among them are numerous published interviews with Josif, as well as the collection of his lectures \\"Prophet of the stone herd\\", made by Vladeta R. Ko≈°utiƒá, after audio recordings.  Writings about music  Josif‚Äôs distinctive artistic sensibility is also displayed in his writings about music. By commenting pieces of music, composers‚Äô opuses, concert performances and achievements of famous musical interpreters, Josif always marked the significance of complete entering, immersing in a piece of art. He compared the musical contexture stratification with the complexity of human being itself and defined the \\"tone revelation of secrets of infinity in formation and development\\" as the sublime purpose of musical art. He used a rich, eruptive language with many unusual and new words by his own.  The book about Milenko ≈Ωivkoviƒá  During the seventh decade of the 20th century, at the proposal of the Department of Fine Arts and Music SASA (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts), Enriko Josif wrote a monograph about his professor Milenko ≈Ωivkoviƒá.

Its origin dates back to 1442, when King John II of Castile donated a hunting lodge outside Burgos, which had been erected by his father Henry III of Castile \\"the Mourner\\" in 1401, to the Order of the Carthusians for its conversion into a monastery, thus fulfilling his father's wishes, as stated in his will. A fire in 1452 caused the destruction of the pavilion, and construction of a new building began in 1454. It is this building, which was placed under the patronage of Saint Mary of the Annunciation, which exists today. The construction was commissioned to Juan de Colonia, and was continued after his death by his son, Sim√≥n de Colonia, who completed the structure in 1484 at the behest of Queen Isabella I of Castile, surviving daughter of kings John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal, whose impressive buried are housed in the monastery. It is a late-Gothic jewel, and its highlights include the church, whose Isabelline style western facade is decorated with the coats-of-arms of its founders. The monastery consists of a single nave with stellar vault and side chapels, and is topped by a polygonal apse.  Situation and access  The Charterhouse is 3 km east of the city center of Burgos, in the parque de Fuentes Blancas, close to the Arlanz√≥n River. The monument is easily accessible from the city of Burgos, and can be reached along an easy footpath in a natural setting. It is possible to go by bus or taxi from the city, and it has free parking for private vehicles and buses. Visits are free and open to the public.  Origins  First in 1401 was erected the Palace-alc√°zar of Miraflores, built by King Henry III of Castile \\"the Mourner\\".\\"The Medieval Foundation, Miraflores Charterhouse\\", cartuja.org Later, the Miraflores Charterhouse was founded in 1442 after the donation to Order of the Carthusians by King John II of Castile inside the Palace-alc√°zar of Miraflores. That original monastery, originally placed under the patronage of Saint Francis of Assisi, suffered a fire in 1452 causing a new approach to the building according to the current design, which was commissioned architect Juan de Colonia, who worked at that time in the Cathedral of Burgos. With the arrival to the throne of the John II's daughter, Isabella I of Castile, return the work in monastery from the year 1477, undertaking new projects such as the Sepulchers of the Kings or the Altarpiece. It will continue the architectural tracery of Garci Fern√°ndez de Matienzo and later of Sim√≥n de Colonia, son of Juan de Colonia, finishing the works of vaulting of the monastery in year 1484. Between 1532 and 1539 undertaken other architectural works in the monastery under direction of Diego de Mendieta, designed to create the side chapels and give greater height to the church as well as the incorporation of spires and pinnacles, and incorporation of the cresting. 19th-century drawings of the Miraflores Charterhouse Both of these sights preverves within today File:John II of Castile Miraflores Charterhouse 1844.jpgSepulchers of John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal in the Miraflores Charterhouse by Jenaro P√©rez Villaamil and Charles Fichot in 1850.

History and description\\" Burgos, 1896. Exterior set=Floor Plan of the Miraflores Charterhouse (Burgos) The floor of the monastery follows other Carthusian monasteries's pattern of the Middle Ages. The floor develops from the placement of the church and the layout of two main cloisters for each of the groups of Carthusian monks who inhabit: Fathers and Brothers. Around these two cloisters are individual hermitages that allows the monk to live solitude and silence own of the Carthusian spirituality. This part of the monastery is not visitable. The floor of the church is formed by a single quadripartite longitudinal nave, distinguishing the spaces of the chancel, the choir of the Fathers, the choir of the Brothers and the faithfuls stay. The nave is closed with vaults with tiercerons, keeping the Gothic original layout. Portal Portal The church's portal rose in year 1486 and was originally located on left side of the monastery, providing access to faithfuls directly from outside the monastery. It consists of pointed archivolts decorated with plants, animals and some human figurative motifs located under a big ogee with poaceaes. In the tympanum represents the motive of the Compassion of the Virgin, which according to late-Medieval iconographic canons, shows the Virgin sitting with her died Son in her arms, accompanied by the symbols of the moon and sun. Stylistically it is linked to the works of the Colonia (father and son), who participated in the rising of the monastery. It can also relate with other portals of other Burgalese monasteries, i.e. the church of San Nicol√°s de Bari or the church of San Lesmes Abad. Between 1657 and 1659 was ordered its move to the current location, accessing from courtyard de la Porter√≠a and connecting to the nave of the monastery. In year 2010 proceeded to restore the portal to returning to its original condition, especially recovering the Compassion of the Virgin's sculpture. Courtyard. Courtyard The entrance's portal to the church of the Charterhouse is currently located in an entrance's courtyard landscaped with a Saint Bruno of Cologne's statue, founder of the Order. Its tracery dates from first half of the 16th century, originally serving as connection of the stays of the monastery with the service units and the porter√≠a. The arcaded long gallery preceding the courtyard is formed by arches that form recessed groin vaults finished off in keystones with modular decoration. In 2010 the cloister is intervened for ensure the maintenance of the walls and consolidate the out of waters of the courtyard, that suffered inclement weather. Inside set Main altarpiece Sepulchers of John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal. Altarpiece The main altarpiece of the Charterhouse was carved in wood by artist Gil de Silo√© and polychrome and gilded by Diego de la Cruz (whose gold came from the first shipments of the Americas after its discovery) Made between 1496 and 1499, is undoubtedly one of the most important existing works of the Spanish Gothic sculpture, by its compositional and iconographic originality and excellent quality of carving, valued by the polychrome. One of the most important elements of the altarpiece is the angelic wheel in which is framed the Christ crucified image for its beauty and significantly accentuated expressiveness by the work of polychrome of Diego de la Cruz. In the outer part of the wheel, are placed the figures of God the Father to the left and the Holy Spirit to the right bearing the rungs of the cross. In the bottom of the cross, the figures of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist complete the scene. The pelican located at top of the cross gives the core set an extraordinary symbolic value as an allegory to the Eucharistic sacrifice, because the bird feeds its birdies of its own blood. Royal Sepulchers Sepulchers of the Kings John II and Isabel of Portugal The royal sepulchers set were designed by artist Gil de Silo√© commissioned by Queen Isabella I of Castile. On the one hand is the Sepulchers of John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal, placed in the nave's center, eight-pointed star shaped. And in the Gospel side of the church is located the Sepulcher of infante Alfonso of Castile. Both sepulchers were made in alabaster and are late-Gothic sculpture's jewels. = Sepulchers of the Kings John II of Castile and Isabella of Portugal = The sepulcher of John II of Castile and of his second wife Isabella of Portugal is made in alabaster and is in Gothic style. It has octagonal eight-pointed star shaped, formed by the superposition of a square and a diamond.

Villarreal Valdez was then captured by the Mexican Federal Police in August 2010, but the violence between the groups for the control of Acapulco continued. The hitmen of the Independent Cartel of Acapulco are known for flaying the faces of their victims and putting them on car seats throughout various points of the city. They are also notorious for extorting taxi drivers and threatening them to avoid taking people to territories of their rivals in risks of getting killed. Part of the reason why the area in Acapulco is often entrenched in violence is because the port city is treasured by drug traffickers due to its corruption, its long and jagged coastline, and the high amount of boat traffic. Hence, Acapulco is considered an ideal place to carry out drug trafficking operations, where smugglers use speedboats to move large sums of cocaine from South America northward. Since the capture of one of their top leaders in December 2011, the Independent Cartel of Acapulco appears to have been damaged severely and has faded from public view. Their weakness, however, appears to have allowed La Barredora, a Sinaloa Cartel-affiliated gang, to take up the drug operations. After the assassination of the YouTuber Pamika Montenegro Real (known as \\"Nana Pelucas\\") in February 2018, the Prosecutor Xavier Olea Pel√°ez said during a press conference that the ambush was organized by Javier Daniel Cervantes Magno (aka \\"El Barbas\\"), member to the cartel of Acapulco led by Jos√© √Ångel Palacios Galeana (aka \\"El Capuchino\\"). Emergence and structure The emergence of the Independent Cartel of Acapulco illustrates how Felipe Calder√≥n's security policy of going after the top drug lords in the cartels have fragmented them into smaller, localized, and autonomous factions, similar to the criminal groups currently operating in Colombia. The strategy of pursuing the top bosses of the drug trafficking organizations ‚Äì known as the \\"Kingpin strategy\\" ‚Äì first happened in Colombia in the 1980s. The effectiveness and results of the strategy in Colombia have raised optimism that the same strategy can work in Mexico. Nonetheless, attacking the logistics of the major organized crime groups (that is, arresting their leaders, killing high-ranking lieutenants, and interrupting their drug shipments) has often led to the creation of smaller, more agile gangs like the Independent Cartel of Acapulco. In recent years, the Acapulco area has experienced one of the highest levels of violence in Mexico, as two gangs battle for the control of the lucrative port with the external support of much larger cartels operating at a national level. The cartel is mostly composed of former members loyal to Edgar Valdez Villarreal, who was arrested in September 2010. The group is responsible for several homicides in Acapulco, and is part of the \\"wave of smaller local gangs\\" operating in the area.

It was excavated in 1970 by Ewald Schuldt and is designated a Sprockhoff No. 472. The megalithic site of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK) was constructed between 3500 and 2800 BC. According to Ingrid Schmidt, \\"Neolithic monuments are an expression of the culture and ideology of New Stone Age communities. Their creation and function are features of social development\\". J. M√ºller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15 The site was painted in 1806 by the Greifswald-born artist, Caspar David Friedrich (1774‚Äì1840). His diagrams and sketches are kept in the Ashmolean Museum of Art & Archaeology at Oxford.  Description  The great dolmen is located near the southwestern edge of the forest, south of Lancken, less than 500 metres from the Baltic Sea. The great dolmen lies in a roughly northeast‚Äìsouthwest-oriented, trapezoidal hunebed about 35 metres long and 12.5 to 7.5 metres wide. Of the 54 kerb stones - including the four guardian stones - 41 have survived. The rectangular, roughly east‚Äìwest-oriented chamber at the wide end of the frame, with its western entrance and porch (Windfang) consists of seven supporting stones (orthostats), a half stone (Halbstein) the height of the uprights and five slabs, on which there are three large (on the chamber) and three small capstones. Only the central capstone of the chamber is missing. One of the four guardian stones at the southwest end, which had already been overturned in the past, has 40 cup marks, one of the kerb stones has three more. The site is a prime example of the porch dolmen (Gro√üdolmen mit Windfang), typical of this region. A two-metre-long porch runs past the support-high half stone to the 4.0 metre long, 1.7 metre wide and 1.4 metre high chamber. The hall consists of red sandstone slabs, annealed flint and a clay floor. Neither human bones nor cremated remains were found, but it has been established that it was later used by members of the Globular Amphora culture. The artefacts found include 1,777 shards, the largest amount of pottery in a site in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. There were also 19 blades, eleven amber beads, (two shaped like a double axe), eight cups, six crosscutters, six scrapers (Klingenkratzer), five biconical vessels, five bowls, two funnel bowls, a scraper (Schaber), a hammerstone and a narrow chisel.

The ballad in Nepal Bhasa dates from the early 19th century.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 80. Crawford, S. Cromwell (1982). The evolution of Hindu ethical ideals. Asian Studies Program, University of Hawaii. . Page 80. Written by an unnamed composer, Silu is a popular seasonal song in Newar society. It is one of the six seasonal songs and is sung during the rainy season (August).Grandin, Ingemar (1989) Music and Media in Local Life: Music Practice in a Newar Neighbourhood in Nepal. Link√∂ping University. . Page 88. Silu is what the Newars call Gosaikunda, a holy lake located to the north of Kathmandu.Waterhouse, David M. (2004). The Origins of Himalayan Studies: Brian Houghton Hodgson in Nepal and Darjeeling, 1820-1858. Routledge. . Page 45. Situated at an elevation of 4,380 m in the Himalaya, it is associated with the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. The lake is also held sacred by Buddhists who associate it with the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. Synopsis The epic song is in the form of a dialogue between the husband and wife. When he announces his plan to visit Silu to take part in the ritual bathing festival, she expresses her desire to go with him. He tries to dissuade her by reminding her of the saying that a husband and wife going together is bad luck. But she insists, and he lets her come along. When they reach Silu, the king sees her and sends soldiers to take her away and forcibly makes her his queen. The depressed husband leaves home and becomes an ascetic. One day, the queen asks the king to assemble all the ascetics on the palace grounds to give them alms. The sadhus are gathered as per her wish, and when she spots her husband among them, she slips away with him disguised as a nun. The couple are thus reunited.Kasa, Prem Bahadur (ed.) (1973). Bakhan Mye. Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 17. Pilgrimage Silu Wanegu, the pilgrimage to Silu to take a holy dip in the lake, is a long-standing tradition in Newar society. The trek is done in August, when a festival is held on the full moon day. The pilgrimage has also been a subject of art since historical times. Silu, a movie based on the ballad, was released in 1987. Lyrics The first few lines of the song appear below.

History and description The church in Bieganowo was built around 1210. At that time it was a wooden temple, named \\"All Saints\\" church. In 1729 squire Franciszek Kowalski crest of Korab, began to build a new church, because the previous one was in ruins. In 1731 Bishop Jan Tar≈Ço of Poznan consecrated it. The church is first mentioned in 1737 by the archdeacon of Pozna≈Ñ, Kacykowski, \\"under the invocation of the Raising of the Holy Cross\\". However, in documents from the second visitation conducted by the Bishop Franciszek Ksawery de Wrbna Rydzy≈Ñski in 1777, the temple was named \\"Finding of the Holy Cross\\". By 1799 the temple was again in ruins. Parish priest Mateusz Borowicz, working with the parish patron Jan Bronisz and parishioners rebuilt the entire church, with a new tower, a stone wall on the outside and a wooden interior. In 1926 the interior of the church was renovated by a new patron, Edward Grabski. During the Nazi occupation the church was closed. When the church was reopened after the war much of it had been destroyed by dry rot. On the night of 1 February 1982 at about 11:45PM a fire broke out and the building burned down in about 30 minutes. Only the tower survived. With the consent of church and state, the liturgy was held in the common rooms of the local, state-owned farms until 17 July 1982. On 15 March 1982, construction of the new church began, made possible by the work of parishioners, and with help from State Farm director Bogumi≈Ç Paul. The church was given new foundations and the original tower was restored. On 21 April 1982 Bishop J√≥zef Glemp, who later became the Polish Primate, assisted by bishop Jan Czerniak, laid the foundation stone along with a brass tube containing documents. By 17 July 1982 the church was completed and, on 25 June 1984, Glemp consecrated the church. In the tower behind the memorial tablet of 1982 are the entombed remains of the parish priest, Fr. Stanislaw Musial, who was murdered in Dachau concentration camp in 1940 and whose body was returned to his family by the Nazis.

He is best known for an on-field incident in which he was knocked unconscious by a punch from player Sherry Magee. Early life Finneran was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he attended public schools before going to work at the age of 14. He was a first baseman in semi-professional baseball before becoming an umpire. Umpiring career Finneran's umpiring career began in amateur baseball in his home of Erie in 1904. By 1905, he was umpiring professionally with the Erie Independent club. He spent the 1906 season in the Interstate League and the Eastern League. He was signed to umpire in the Tri-State League for the 1907 and 1908 seasons. By 1909, he had returned to the Eastern League, which was newly promoted to Class AA. Finneran joined the staff of the National League in 1911, but had moved to the Class AA International League by 1913, where he remained in 1914. He umpired in the Federal League in 1915. He then spent several seasons umpiring minor league baseball in the Northwestern League and the American Association. Magee incident On July 10, 1911, Finneran called a third strike on Philadelphia's Sherry Magee. Magee responded angrily, striking Finneran with one punch that left the umpire momentarily unconscious and bleeding. Magee was initially suspended for the remainder of the season. However, he was allowed to return to the field on August 16 following an appeal. Media coverage at the time described Magee as a \\"nervous, irritable player\\" and refers to an incident in which Magee had jumped from a second story window after being overcome by extreme heat. The same coverage also indicates that Finneran \\"has never been regarded as a competent umpire\\" despite early prospects. Finneran was said to have been \\"somewhat of a 'scrapper'\\" and may have been warned by his partner against making threats toward players. Death Finneran died in Erie, Pennsylvania on July 3, 1961.

In the following century, the orator Aelius Aristides gives the story a political interpretation as a warning to avoid entrapment in dangerous situations.Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire, New York 2010, p.7 A flowery Latin version of the Greek poem was made by Andrea Alciato for his book of emblems(1531), where it figures as a picture of greed.Emblem 95 He was followed in this interpretation by the English emblematist Geoffrey Whitney, who turns it into a health warning: :::The Gluttons fatte, that daintie fare devoure, :::And seeke about, to satisfie theire taste: :::And what they like, into theire bellies poure, :::This justlie blames, for surfettes come in haste: ::::And biddes them feare, their sweete, and dulcet meates, ::::For oftentimes, the same are deadlie baites.A Choice of Emblemes, 1586, Emblem 128 The Frome physician Samuel Bowden reads the same lesson into it in his mock-heroic poem 'occasion'd by a Mouse caught in an Oyster-Shell' (1736) that concludes with the lines :::Instructed thus ‚Äî let Epicures beware, :::Warn'd of their fate ‚Äî nor seek luxurious fare.Reely's Audio Poems Bowden's poem was a popular one and anthologised for a century afterwards.

The French author's mouse is a naive creature who knows the world only from books and comes to grief not simply through greed but for lack of experience.VIII.9 In this lively poem, one of La Fontaine's images recalls Alciato's emblem. Arriving at the sea, where 'The tide had left the oysters bare/ He thought these shells the ships must be'. In some of the illustrations to Alciato's work there is indeed a similarity between the pattern on the shell that has closed on the mouse and the boat under sail on the sea.Alciato at Glasgow site ReferencesExternal links * Book illustrations from the 16th - 20th centuries Mouse and the Oyster, The Greek Anthology Mouse and the Oyster, The Mouse and the Oyster, The Mouse and the Oyster, The ","title":"The Mouse and the Oyster"},{"id":"36057038","text":"Sport in Wrze≈õnia - there are several sports facilities in Wrze≈õnia, Poland.

(2014). The dynamics of crowdfunding: An exploratory study. Journal of Business Venturing. Vol. 29, pp. 1-16. Crowdfunded projects may include creative works, products, nonprofit organizations, supporting entrepreneurship, businesses, or donations for a specific purpose (e.g., to pay for a medical procedure). Crowdfunding usually takes place via an online portal that handles the financial transactions involved and may also provide services such as media hosting, social networking, and facilitating contact with contributors. It has increased since the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.  Crowdfunding use  Crowdfunding has a wide reach and may be utilized by businesses, nonprofit organizations, an individual, group, or an organization. Crowdfunding is used in a variety of platforms from social media to face-to- face environments. The use of crowdfunding has increased; however, success is not guaranteed. Funds may be sought out to start a business, to support a cause, or to reach a fundraising goal. Most crowdfunding projects are small and ‚Äúseek to raise small amounts of capital, often under $1000.‚Äù An individual or organization may not qualify for a traditional bank loan, and crowdfunding provides another opportunity to gain financial support from others. The use of crowdfunding has gained an increased presence since the JOBS Act and has a significant social media presence. ‚ÄúApproximately 25 percent of real-world relationships start online, with people of all ages migrating online to find a partner. Crowdfunding is doing for small businesses and entrepreneurs what dating sites have done for singles.‚Äù Hollas, J. (2013). Is crowdfunding now a threat to traditional finance? Corporate Finance Review. Vol 18, issue 1, pp. 27-31. Those unable to procure funding from traditional methods may be interested in pursuing crowdfunding as an option; however, the success rate may be a deterrent. E. Mollick examined Kickstarter projects from 2009 through 2012 and found many projects were not successful as only ‚Äú3% raise 50% of their goal,‚Äù and he stated that successful projects succeed ‚Äúby relatively small margins.‚Äù  Crowdfunding models  Crowdfunding is donation-based fundraising for businesses or creative projects, typically via an online funding portal. Some but not all crowdfunding projects offer contributors rewards, which may differ based on the amount of money donated. Rewards can include copies of a creative work, products generated with the funding, special or personalized incentives (such as autographed works or promotional merchandise), or public recognition. One can classify crowdfunding as using one of the following models: # Equity-based crowdfunding # Reward-based crowdfunding # Debt-based crowdfunding # Litigation crowdfunding # Donation- based crowdfunding Equity-based crowdfunding In equity crowdfunding, a crowdfunding approach is used to raise investment capital, and contributors receive equity in the resulting business. It is a joint effort made between individuals to support the causes of other people or organizations in the form of equity. Contributors may act as investors and receive shares directly, or the crowdfunding service may act as a nominated agent. Equity crowdfunding helps \\"the 90 percent of businesses that were left out in the cold\\" by traditional funding methods, which is why it has become such a viable option for business startups. Equity-based funding is illegal in many countries, such as India. In the United States the JOBS Act of 2012 regulated the trend. This \\"legislation was intended to increase access to capital for the innovative companies\\" in need of investment capital and allows a pool of small investors to come together. Reward-based crowdfunding This mode, also known as \\"non-equity\\" funding, has become increasingly popular, with a 230 percent increase in 2012. Reward-based crowdfunding may fund campaigns supporting the free development of software, the promotion of motion pictures, scientific research, development of inventions, etc. Reward-based funders expect a return from the project. Debt-based crowdfunding This is known as \\"Peer to Peer\\", \\"P2P\\", \\"marketplace lending\\", or \\"crowdlending\\". Borrowers set up campaigns to fulfill their financial needs, and lenders contribute toward the goal for an interest. This method of online funding may prove to be \\"a threat to the traditional banking system in the areas of consumer and business loans, as has already been demonstrated by the rapid success of [these] online lending marketplaces.\\" Litigation crowdfunding A plaintiff requests a monetary donation to fund a court case. If the claimant wins, investors may get more than their initial investment. Donation-based crowdfunding This type of crowdfunding \\"is part of a trend in which people are relying less on charities to help them fulfill their philanthropic aims\\". The future of fundraising: Is crowdfunding the wave of the future? (2016). Third Sector. October 1, 2016. 29. The best example might be raising funds from individuals to support personal or social causes.  Variables in online crowdfunding  People make donations for different reasons and give to different entities. Donors may give to feel good about themselves or because they believe in a cause. Some donations are made to individuals while others are made to organizations. The same is true in online crowdfunding. However, some differences exist in their method of giving, geography, and demographics. Online crowdfunding donors differ from traditional fundraising donors in that donors give anonymously, do not have a connection to the recipient, and donors may seek out a cause or recipient to give to. Another important factor is that online donors are not limited by their geographic location and can give to individuals or organizations anywhere in the world. When it comes to motives, donations are made to individuals to help them reach a goal and typically drop off once that is met; however, donations to organizations are made for a greater societal good. The demographics of online donors vary from traditional donors as ‚Äúonline donors tend to be younger and give larger gifts than traditional donors.‚Äù This is important for online campaign organizers to note as they determine their target audience; however, those over 50 have increased their social media usage and have a presence on Facebook.  Crowdfunding as a replacement method  More research is needed in regard to the topic of crowdfunding in general. There are benefits to online crowdfunding as it has the ability to tap into audiences that are not close in geographic proximity to an individual or organization and to increase awareness about a campaign. However, with relatively low funding success rates reported, \\"social networking and traditional approaches to fundraising may be complements\\" to help individuals and organizations raise funds but not a replacement.‚Äù See also *Peer-to-peer lending *Equity crowdfunding *Crowdsourcing  References  Crowdfunding lists Crowdfunding services !

Salter works in a variety of media, including drawing, painting, digital art, animation, kinetic sculpture, and sculptural assemblage.Holliman, Woody; Art Papers Magazine, March/April 2000 His work often references and subverts the visual language of corporate branding and graphic design, and reflects his desire to, in his words: \\"sort out the cacophony of visual noise in order to rethink meaning, motive, perception and narrative.\\" His work has been described as postmodern, whimsical, quirky, unsettling, cryptic,Johnson- Dougherty, Linda; Art Papers Magazine, January/February 2002 and thought- provoking.Leffingwell, Edward; Art in America, October 2008 Salter is perhaps best known for his giant Styrobots - a series of site-specific installations which rise ceiling-high to dominate their space. Career and early work=Education Salter began college as a marketing major before narrowing his focus to the visual and creative aspect of design. He earned his BFA from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, with to a double concentration in sculpture and graphic design. He received his MFA in studio art from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Early work After spending some time as a successful graphic designer, Salter became disillusioned with the consumer culture his work was contributing to. As a member of the artist collective Team Lump, in 1998 he began participating in Lump Gallery group shows, creating what one reviewer later described as \\"whimsical parodies of corporate logotypes and manufactured objects\\", using the language of institutional-style graphics to \\"spoof\\" them. Two years later, he displayed a photo series: discontinuous editing, which depicted uninhabited industrial landscapes. Both the \\"irrational\\" iconsHolliman, Woody; Art Papers Magazine, October 1998 and the images of unpopulated urban or sub-urban landscapes would become recurring motifs in Salter's work, reemerging in three-dimensional and animated forms in Salter's later work. Later work Artist Michael Salter contemplates his giant Styrobot at the San Jose Museum of Art. Styrobots Around 2003, inspired by their \\"mechanical\\" shapes, Salter began using pre-formed styrofoam packing materials to construct a six-foot tall robotic sculpture. Over time the Styrobots have grown with each successive show, expanding to fill their available space. The tallest Styrobot to date was created for a group show at the San Jose Museum of Art in 2008, \\"Robots: Evolution of a Cultural Icon\\". Rising to a height of 22 feet, the massive figure was surrounded by and appeared to be looking down at a number of smaller Styrobots at its feet. Later that year, a solo show at Rice University titled too much featured a Styrobot nearly as large in a much smaller space, crouched in a defeated position in the corner, surrounded on all sides by walls plastered with scores of images culled from Salter's collection of graphic icons. Icons From the beginning, Salter's gallery installations have included a variety of stylized images, often referred to as \\"icons\\", but perhaps more properly called pictograms. Executed in the simple, generic, black and white style of international signage, they seem at first familiar, yet their surrealistic content defies explanation. In the words of one reviewer, by parodying the near ubiquity of corporate logotypes and institutional style graphics, Salter \\"calls attention to what he calls the 'invisible fabric' of random, banal images and objects which threatens to smother us with its mind-numbing profusion.\\" Sculptures and kinetic sculptures \\"The chair as a symbol of authority has literally been turned on its head,\\" said critic Woody Holliman of Salter's circa 2000 work l'arc des'chaises, an \\"anti-heroic spectacle\\" of ten small plastic children's chairs bolted together in a semi-circle and flipped upside down. Two years later, the kinetic sculpture epilepsony featured recorded music with a vibrating figure on a tray under bright light. Pick Me A Winner, in 2008, literally embodied its title, as a motorized finger relentlessly aimed for a small molded nose. Disembodied appendages also feature in Finger Lickin' Good: a tiny kinetic sculpture in which \\"the pointed finger rotates on a single axis gently brushing against a tiny rubber tongue. The rubber tongue slightly bounces when it licks the finger, coming to a complete stop before lickin' again.\\" Installations Subzer-o Jeff Bailey Gallery Salter has exhibited works in solo and group shows nationally and internationally. His 2008 show at the Jeff Bailey Gallery in New York was reviewed in the October issue of Art in America that year. The show, entitled Are You Sure, featured a variety of elements from his ouvre, including the fourteen foot tall Styrobot, a series of digital C-prints titled Situations Unknown depicting empty suburban landscapes containing a single improbable element, and a collection of porcelain figurines dubbed Subzer-o: a series of static humanoid figures, each branded with its own logo, packaging, and text describing its particular depressing attributes. BLK/MRKT Gallery Informatics and The Styrobot Face Off, an installation at BLK/MRKT Gallery in 2006, included a central space filled with two opposing Styrobots mirroring each other's aggressive posturing. Grouped around these oversize figures were a number of smaller works in a variety of media: lighted panels displaying Salter's \\"spoofs\\" on graphic design and corporate logotypes, a shelf of colorful toylike monsters in tubes, two imploded oil cans covered with glossy paint and appliqu√©s, a series of images depicting surreal suburban environs, small sharks apparently swimming into a wall, and the kinetic sculpture Finger Lickin' Good. This piece and the appropriated oil cans would reappear the next year in the group show Introduction, the inaugural exhibition of the think.21 gallery in Brussels, Belgium. think.21 Contemporary Gallery In 2009, Salter would install a solo show at think.21, If You Don't Buy It From Us, It's Not Our Problem If You Don't Buy It From Us, It's Not Our Problem think.21 Contemporary Gallery; Retrieved 9 June 2012] which included a pensive looking seated Styrobot and the \\"absurd\\" figure of a giant singing yellow banana whose pants had fallen to his ankles. New Britain Museum of American Art For his solo show as the New Britain Museum of American Art featured \\"New/Now\\" artist in 2012, Salter displayed commercial-like signage with ominous undertones, an oversize graphic image of a delicate hand pinching a denuded flower, small chimera-like sculptures made of toy figurines, and two Icon-o-lots - panels covered with what one reviewer characterized as \\"subversive glyphs that seem to exist just beyond one's ability to perceive them.\\" Collaborations Burning Billboard (from the Situations Unknown series), 2007, digital C-print, ed. 3, 22\\" x 28\\". Salter has collaborated with the artist Chris Coleman on a series of animations called My House is not My House (2008-2010). Based on Salter's Situations Unknown illustrations, with animation and incidental sounds added by Coleman, each five-minute loop depicts a view of a seemingly unoccupied suburban home, where, as Coleman says: \\"time passes and nothing seems to change.\\" The four high definition \\"digital paintings\\" were commissioned in 2011 for the opening of the Lithium Project Art Gallery in Napoli, Italy. From the beginning of his career, Salter has both benefited from and contributed to the success of Team Lump, an artist collective collaborating since at least the late 1990s. An outgrowth of the Raleigh, North Carolina project space Lump, founded by Bill Thelen, Team Lump and the Lump Gallery is an alternative art space which showcases conceptual and challenging work by emerging artists from all disciplines. Motifs Salter's work is characterized by a response to and a subversion of consumer culture, the ubiquity of corporate branding, and the banality of urban and suburban landscapes. His installations often feature disorienting shifts in scale and surrealistic elements - improbable content that defies literal interpretation. Chairs were a recurring motif in Salter's early work, and sharks sometimes surface. The giant Styrobots continue to command attention, and over time have evolved (or devolved) in form. In a 2012 show at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, two of Salter's recurring motifs combined in ANDY: Autonomous Nautical Deepwater stYrobot- a twenty foot long Styroshark. \\"Sharks sort of exist in pop culture to a level of invisibility,\\" he said. \\"My gut reaction is always to go to that invisible, saturated level.\\" The artist is also known to have a fondness for puns.

It manages nodes over SSH using the Bourne Shell, and does not require any additional software to be installed on target nodes. Cdist differentiates itself from competing configuration management systems by choosing the Bourne Shell as the primary language for writing configuration scripts and requiring effectively no dependencies on target nodes. Although cdist's core is written in Python, an interpreter is only required on the host machine, not target nodes. Development cdist development started in 2010 at ETH Zurich and is actively being developed and is maintained primarily by Nico Schottelius and Steven Armstrong. The major part of the discussion about cdist happens on the mailinglist and on the IRC channel #cstar in the Freenode network. cdist is being used at various companies in Switzerland (such as ETH Zurich and The OMA Browser project), the US, Germany and France. Features cdist is a zero dependency configuration management system: It requires only ssh and a bourne- compatible shell on target hosts, which are provided by default on most Unix- like machines. Because of this, cdist can be used to bootstrap other configuration management systems. Installation and configuration cdist is not typically installed as a package (like .deb or .rpm), but rather via git. All commands are run from the created checkout. The entry point for any configuration is the shell script conf/manifest/init, which is called initial manifest in cdist terms. The main components of cdist are so called types, which bundle functionality. The types essentially consists of a number of shell scripts to define which types a type reuses and which code is generated to be executed on the target host. Architecture cdist is split into two components: * The core * The configuration scripts Core Cdist's core handles reading configuration and communicating with remote hosts. Like Ansible, cdist uses a \\"push\\" model to apply configuration changes: A cdist process on the \\"host\\" machine connects to any number of remote nodes via SSH and then performs configuration updates on those nodes. Cdist can configure multiple hosts in parallel to reduce the time spent configuring. Configuration The configuration scripts define how the targets shall be configured. They are typically written in Bourne Shell and consists of * The initial manifest, an entry point where all configuration runs begin. This script typically uses information about the target node, such as its hostname and operating system, to call other, more specific scripts which perform the actual configuration. * Global Explorers, small scripts which gleam information about the target system (such as operating system, init system, and hostname) * Types, which describe reusable chunks of configuration. Types are instantiated in manifests and are the only way to actually run code on the target machines. The name \\"type\\" is meant as an analog to \\"class\\" in an object-oriented language, because a type can be turned into multiple \\"objects\\" depending on what parameters are passed to it. For instance, the \`__file\` type can be turned into multiple \\"objects\\", each one representing the creation of a certain file. Ansible's \\"roles\\" are the equivalent of cdist's types. Types can have many components: **Object ID: When a type is turned into an object, it is passed a unique object ID. The same type cannot be instantiated twice with the same ID. This ID is not random like a UUID, but rather is some unique identifier that is meaningful in relation to the type. For example, the \`__file\` type's ID is the absolute path to the file. **Parameters: Many types cannot be fully described by the object ID, and take additional information in the form of parameters. The \`__file\` type takes a \`group\` parameter which specifies to which Unix group should own the file. **Explorers: In addition to the global explorers described above, types sometimes have their own explorers that collect type-specific information from the remote machine. The \`__file\` type uses explorers to determine whether the file being created already exists. It sometimes uses this information to skip creation of the file. **Manifest: A type manifest can instantiate other types, making code re-use easy. **Gencode Scripts: The \`gencode-remote\` script is the main way to actually update the configuration of target nodes. \`gencode-remote\` runs on the local machine, but its standard output is sent to the remote machine and executed as a shell script. There is also a less frequently used \`gencode- local\` script which outputs code to be run locally. Shell is the de facto language for writing cdist configuration scripts, but most of the scripts can be written in any language if they contain a suitable shebang line. Shell scripting is favored because of how simple it is to access environment variables, read files, and execute system commands. Configuration language All user configurable parts are contained in manifests or gencode-scripts, which are shell scripts. Shell scripts were chosen, because Unix System Administrators are usually proficient in reading and writing shell scripts. Furthermore, shell is also commonly available on potential target systems, thus avoiding the need to install additional software there (\\"zero dependencies\\"). cdist reads its configuration from the initial manifest (conf/manifest/init), in which hosts are mapped to types: case \\"$__target_host\\" in myhostname) __package zsh --state present __addifnosuchline /tmp/cdist-welcome --line \\"Welcome to cdist\\" ;; esac When using the types in cdist, they are called like normal programs in manifests and can make use of advanced parameter parsing as well as reading from stdin: # Provide a default file, but let the user change it __file /home/frodo/.bashrc --source \\"/etc/skel/.bashrc\\" \\\\ state exists \\\\ owner frodo --mode 0600 # Take file content from stdin __file /tmp/whatever --owner root --group root --mode 644 --source - << DONE Here goes the content for /tmp/whatever DONE Dependencies are expressed by setting up the require environment variable: __directory /tmp/foobar require=\\"__directory//tmp/foobar\\" __file /tmp/foobar/baz Access to paths and files within types is given by environment variables like . Similar software Ansible, like cdist, uses an agentless push model to configure nodes. However, Ansible normally requires Python on its targets, whereas cdist does not. Ansible makes a distinction between roles, written in a declarative YAML-based language, and modules, written in Python. Cdist only has \\"types\\" which serve the purposes of both modules and roles and are mostly written in Bourne Shell. Cdist's approach might be preferable because Shell is familiar to many system administrators who have never used a configuration management system before, but Ansible's declarative language is arguably more readable and appropriate.

Early life Sirkis spent his teens and early twenties in Rehovot, Israel where he began drum lessons aged 12. His early musical influences were The Beatles, The Police, Yes, Allan Holdsworth, Weather Report, classical music, Arabic, Balkan, Klezmer, Pop, and Israeli folk music. In 1990, shortly after he completed his three-year national service he started his full-time professional career working as an all-around drummer in Israel. He has played with some of Israel's jazz and world music luminaries such as Harold Rubin, Albert Beger, Yair Dalal, Eyal Sela and many more.  Career  In 1993 Sirkis moved to Tel Aviv and soon after formed the Asaf Sirkis trio featuring Kobi Arad on keyboards, and Gabriel Mayer on electric bass. With that line up he recorded his first solo album One Step Closer (1996) as well as touring in Israel with the trio. In 1997 he formed the 'Asaf Sirkis & The Inner Noise' trio. The Inner Noise was a unique trio and the first jazz/rock group to incorporate an innovative line up of church organ guitar and drums. Asaf left Israel in 1998, settling in London in 1999. In 2000 Sirkis re-formed the Inner Noise trio with Steve Lodder on church organ and Mike Outram on guitar. The band has recorded three acclaimed albums - Inner Noise, We Are Falling and The Song Within. Shortly after he arrived in London he met Gilad Atzmon with whom he formed The Orient House Ensemble and recorded 7 albums, including Exile, which won \\"Best CD of the Year\\" at the BBC Jazz Award 2003 while the band was nominated for \\"Best Band\\" in 2004. After almost 10 years in the OHE, Sirkis left the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career and other collaborations. Since 2006 Sirkis has been collaborating with reeds player and composer Tim Garland with whom he toured the world and recorded many albums. Asaf has also worked with Jacob Collier, Larry Coryell, Gwilym Simcock,Jazz breaking news: Gwilym Simcock, Tim Garland and Asaf Sirkis shine as luminous Lighthouse fill the Forge, by Stephen Graham, 16 May 2012 John Abercrombie, Kenny Wheeler, Norma Winstone, John Taylor, Gary Husband, Andy Sheppard, Dave Liebman, Natacha Atlas, Bob Sheppard, Mark Egan, Soft Machine, John Etheridge, Mark Wingfield, Nicolas Meier, David Binney, Norman Watt-Roy, Wilko Johnson, Jeff Berlin, Billy Sherwood and many more. Since 2014, Sirkis is co-leading the Sirkis/Bialas International Quartet together with Polish singer/composer Sylwia Bialas. The Quartet features pianist Frank Harrison and Scottish bassist Kevin Glasgow. Their debut album Come To Me was released in 2014 at the London Jazz Festival. Come To Me has been selected as one of the best albums of 2015 at All About Jazz website by several reviewers and the band has toured extensively since the release date. The Quartet's new double album 'Our New Earth' is scheduled to be released in 2019 on Moonjune Records. Recently, Asaf has been collaborating with various artists on the Moonjune Records record label. Notably, the Reuter/Wingfield/Stavi Sirkis collaboration album has been selected as a masterpiece of 2017 at DownBeat magazine as well as receiving rave reviews. Asaf can be heard on many recent Moonjune albums alongside Spanish guitarist Carles Benavent, Nguyen Le, Dewa Budjana, Indonesian pianist Dwiki Dharmawan, Gary Husband, Mark Wingfield, Markus Reuter, and many more.  Education  Sirkis has been studying the art of the south Indian vocal percussion (Konnakol) at the Tamil centre in west London under the guidance of master percussionist Mr Paramasamy Kirupakaran and from various other sources. Asaf has developed a simple, step-by-step method of teaching Konnakol that can help any instrumentalist or vocalist of any musical genre and level to increase rhythmic awareness and focus. Nowadays, Sirkis is involved in a variety of educational work, bringing Konnakol to western music education as a useful tool of understanding rhythm for western musicians. He has given many workshops and seminars around the world on the subject and has a YouTube channel with Konnakol tutorials. As of 2017, he is a principal lecturer in jazz drums at Leeds College of Music and teaches drums and Konnakol at Trinity Laban Conservatory in London.

John Rickman was the only child in an extended Quaker family and was throughout his life a practising Quaker. His father ran an ironmonger‚Äôs shop in Dorking and died of tuberculosis when John was 2. His mother never remarried, and the main male influences in his early life were his grandfathers. John‚Äôs maternal grandfather was often unkind to him, something he recalled years later when in analysis with S√°ndor Ferenczi. He was at Leighton Park, the Quaker school near Reading, along with two other leading members of the British Psychoanalytical Society, Helton Godwin Baynes and Lionel Penrose. Rickman later studied Natural Sciences at King‚Äôs College, Cambridge, followed by Medicine at St Thomas‚Äôs Hospital in London. First World War When the First World War broke out, John continued his training and faced with conscription, became a conscientious objector and refused to join up. In 1916 Rickman joined ‚Äòthe Friends‚Äô War Victims Relief Service‚Äô in the Samara Oblast province of South Russia, where there was great poverty and deprivation, and the Czar still ruled. There he taught peasant women how to nurse typhoid patients during an epidemic and made anthropological observations of the severe limitations of village life. In 1917 Rickman met an American social worker Lydia Cooper Lewis, who had just joined the Relief Service unit. John and Lydia married in Buzuluk on 20 March 1918, after the revolution, and then set off on a dramatic and dangerous escape from the horrors of Civil War, arriving at Vladivostok after more than three months on a very slow trans-Siberian railway journey, frequently stopped and searched by rival agents of the civil war. Once home, Rickman worked as a medical officer with psychiatric patients at Fulbourn Hospital in Cambridge. In Cambridge he met W. H. R. Rivers, an anthropologist and physician who had treated soldiers traumatized by the war at Craiglockhart Hospital in Edinburgh. Rivers advised Rickman to seek an analysis with Freud. Between the wars In 1919 Rickman went to Vienna to have analysis with Freud. He made many contacts there, including Karl Abraham (1877‚Äì1925) and S√°ndor Ferenczi (1873‚Äì1933). He continued with Freud until 1922, when he qualified as a psychoanalyst. In 1928 he travelled to Budapest to have treatment from Ferenczi. In 1934 Rickman began an analysis with Melanie Klein that was to continue, intermittently, until 1941 and again for some sessions after the war. In 1938 Dr Wilfred Bion, who had been working as a psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic, asked Rickman to be his training psychoanalyst. This was brought to a premature end by the onset of the second world war. Second World War At the beginning of 1940 Rickman was sent to Wharncliffe Hospital near Sheffield, where his work attracted considerable interest and admiration from army psychologists and psychiatrists, including Wilfred Bion, who visited him there. As a result of this reunion Bion drafted what came to be known as the Wharncliffe Memorandum, of which no copy has survived. It contained some of the first ideas on what was to become after the war the therapeutic community movement. Rickman joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and with the rank of major was posted to Northfield Military Hospital near Birmingham in July 1942. Most of the patients there were soldiers who could not manage army life. Rickman‚Äôs approach was thoughtful, practical and hopeful, not typical of army psychiatrists of the day. Wilfred Bion asked to be transferred to Northfield and arrived in September of the same year. Here he initiated what has since been seen as a revolutionary experiment with groups which, though it lasted only six weeks, led to developments in the understanding and management of groups, not only in mental health but in public services and organisations. After the Second World War Over three decades Rickman played an important part in the foundation and development of the British Psychoanalytical Society, and later, behind the scenes, in building a bridge between it and the Tavistock Clinic. He was the editor of the British Journal of Medical Psychology from 1935 to 1949 and published a great deal (Rickman 1957). Most of his writing after the First World War was infused with psychoanalysis, but his experiences in Russia and Cambridge, and his Quaker commitment to social justice, sexual equality and non-violence, put him ahead of his time. At the end of the war Rickman renewed his involvement in the British Psychoanalytical Society and was elected president from 1947 to 1950. He died on 1 July 1951, aged only 60.

Written in 1844-1846 under the original title Is She to Blame? (–í–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –ª–∏ –æ–Ω–∞?), it was published only in 1858 in Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya magazine (vol. 147, books 1 and 2).Yeryomin, Mikhail. Works by A.F.Pisemsky in 3 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya literatura. Moscow, 1956. Vol.1. Commentaries. pp.531-535. Background The novel has a long and complicated history which has been reconstructed only partially, according to Pisemsky's biographer M.P.Yeryomin. Pisemsky started working upon it in 1844 and finished it in 1845. In the 1858 magazine version he dated it \\"September 30, 1844, Moscow\\", then four years later, in the Stellovsky edition, \\"September 30, 1845, Moscow\\". Later in his autobiography and in a letter to his French translator Victor Dereli he insisted the novel was finished in 1846. The reason for this, according to Yeryomin, was the fact that the novel existed in three different versions, the first of which was completed in 1844. In summer and autumn of 1845 in Moscow Pisemsky continued to change the text, hence the new date. It was then that he sent a copy to Stepan Shevyryov, then a Moskvityanin critic, who advised the author to revise the text. On March 13 1847 Pisemsky in a letter informed Shevyryov (mentioning a character whose name has been changed later to Zador-Manovsky): \\"I've made changes to the novelet Is She to Blame? according to your instructions. Smoothened some scenes, and what's more important, paid more attention to Vankovsky, the heroine's husband, made him more humane, as it were.\\"A.F.Pisemsky. Letters. Moscow-Leningrad, 1936. P.24 In 1848 Pisemsky sent the novel to Otechestvennye zapisky but even this new 'softened' version was rejected by censors. In 1850 Pisemsky tried to publish the novel in Moscow using his friend and mentor Alexander Ostrovsky's influence. \\"I'm quite prepared to re-work it and remove some harsh scenes. In Saint Petersburg it was banned, do you think it has any chance to pass through in Moscow? I'd like to see it printed wherever you'd like, in your almanac, in Moskvityanin, just so that it won't be wasted, I feel so sorry for it even if now I'm slightly grown out of it, I think,\\" Pisemsky wrote to Ostrovsky on 26 December 1850. Whether the novel has been sent to Moskvityanin or not, remained unknown. As late as March 1857 Pisemsky referred to his novel as Is She to Blame?, even if this title had been used already for a completely different novelet, published in 1855 by Sovremennik. Only after it became clear Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya will publish the book, its title was changed to Boyarshchina. Apparently, having lost all hope in seeing the novel printed, Pisemsky used several of its scenes in his other work, notably The Rich Fiancee.Biblioteka dlya chtenya, 1858, vol. 147, book I, p.1 Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya published the novel in its original form, not the 'improved' version the author informed Shevyryov about.

It was published June 1, 2012 and preceded by Feed (2010) and Deadline (2011). Plot Blackout is set several decades after the zombie apocalypse, the Rising. Kellis-Amberlee is a normally beneficial virus that, on the death of any host mammal over , \\"goes live\\" or \\"amplifies\\", and turns them into a zombie. Most humans reside in controlled zones, and blogs are now the primary source of news and entertainment. The novel is written from the perspectives of Georgia and Shaun Mason, siblings and blogger-reporters. Over the preceding books, they, along with their colleagues at the After The End Times website, have uncovered a widespread conspiracy. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the agency responding to the zombie virus and responsible for public health and safety, is actually creating new substrains (culminating in a mosquito-transmitted variant released at the end of Deadline), killing off those developing immune responses (including Georgia, who was assassinated during the events of Feed), and frustrating research into a cure. Shaun Mason, having discovered his immunity to the virus, is helping with Dr. Abbey's zombie research while hiding out from the CDC with the rest of the After the End Times team: Rebecca Atherton, Mahir Gowda, Maggie Garcia, and Alaric Kwong. Dr. Abbey tasks Shaun and Rebecca with travelling to zombie-infested Florida and recovering live mosquitoes for study, but when they head back to Berkeley, California to meet with Shaun's adoptive parents, they are lured into a trap and barely escape the CDC. Disheartened, Shaun and Rebecca head north to Seattle, where Maggie and Mahir have contacted the identity forger, the Monkey. He agrees to help them disappear with new identities if they help steal information from the Seattle CDC facility. The team, minus Maggie, breaks in and set up a remote- access Wi-Fi hotspot, but their escape is hampered by a security alert. After dying, Georgia awakens as a prisoner in a CDC facility and quickly concludes that she is a clone. With the help of Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) undercover agents, Georgia learns she is a 97 percent match to the mind of the original Georgia and is intended as a \\"showroom model\\" for resurrection through cloning. She also discovers she is in Seattle, and other Georgia clones have been created, including a less mentally accurate but more compliant version for use against Shaun. The agents use a week-long sleep study as a cover to remove trackers and self-destruct devices implanted in Georgia's body, but a mole exposes the EIS team. Georgia escapes and takes the security alert as an opportunity to destroy the other clones. Shaun, seeking an exit, runs into Georgia, fleeing her improvised explosives. They link up with Rebecca and Mahir, and escape to meet Maggie at the Agora luxury hotel. Although initially reluctant to accept Georgia's existence, her knowledge and mannerisms gradually convince the group that she is a real, accurate clone. They go to see the Monkey but are betrayed by one of his subordinates. A CDC squad attacks the location: the Monkey and his people are killed, and Maggie is wounded. She is left at the Agora for treatment, and the team heads back to Dr. Abbey's lab, where an EIS agent is waiting to transport them to Washington, D.C.. They are taken to the White House by Rick Cousins (former After the End Times journalist, now Vice President of the United States) to meet President Peter Ryman, who is being coerced to continue the conspiracy. The CDC has found a cure for Kellis-Amberlee, but the cure destroys the immune system so instead, they have focused on engineering the virus to prevent natural immunities from developing, while taking measures to ensure they remain in power. While Shaun, Becks, and Alaric are briefed on (and secretly recording) the party line by a CDC scientist, Rick takes Georgia aside to explain the situation before they, with help from the EIS and the Secret Service, \\"kidnap\\" Ryman. The CDC initiates an outbreak inside the White House, during which Rebecca sacrifices herself to hold back the horde while the others escape. The survivors head to an EIS facility, where Shaun and Georgia help Ryman address the world, while Mahir orchestrates junior members of After the End Times to upload supporting evidence and blow the conspiracy wide open. As the world comes to terms with the revelations, the EIS takes over the CDC, while Georgia and Shaun head to the wilds of Canada to escape the limelight. Background Shortly before the 22 May release of Blackout (2012), McGuire released Fed, an alternate ending to the first Newsflesh novel, Feed (2010). The alternate ending was initially made available on Facebook on 17 May, then released online by Orbit on 23 May. Reception Blackout was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

As a junior in 2005‚Äì06, he averaged 25.7 points and 15.6 rebounds per game. On November 22, 2006, Raji signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for Boston College. As a senior in 2006‚Äì07, Raji averaged 28.7 points, 16.7 rebounds, 4.4 blocks and 3.4 assists per game and was subsequently named the North Jersey Player of the Year by The Record. He also earned first-team All-State honors from The Star- Ledger. He finished his career as Westwood's career scoring leader with 2,497 points; also recorded 1,757 career rebounds. College career In his freshman season, Raji played in all 31 games with six starting assignments while averaging 8.3 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. The Eagles struggled in 2007‚Äì08, going 14-17 and missing the NCAA Tournament. The Eagles were much improved during Raji's second season, thanks in part to the emergence of freshman Reggie Jackson, and made the NCAA Tournament. Raji averaged 9.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 34 games (all starts). Raji scored 15 points in a season-ending loss to USC in the NCAA Tournament. The Eagles came into Raji's junior season without Tyrese Rice after he graduated, but Reggie Jackson and Rakim Sanders returned along with Raji. Raji and the Eagles both got off to quick starts. Raji scored over 10 points per game in his first ten appearances. Meanwhile, the Eagles won six of their first eight games, recording wins over Michigan, Miami and Providence. The Eagles struggled the rest of the season, however, finishing with a losing record. Raji finished the season with averages of 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds in 29 games (all starts).

The season started with a win before losing in an upset to the Yale Bulldogs despite a 12-point performance from Raji. The Eagles more or less neutralized star Greg Mangano, who scored only eight points, but they could only muster 67 points in the loss. BC went on to win nine of their next ten games. Later in the season, Raji scored 22 points in a win over Georgia Tech and 21 points in a win over Wake Forest. The Eagles made the NIT but lost in the second round to the John Shurna-led Northwestern Wildcats. The Eagles finished the season with 20 wins. Raji's senior season was more or less successful. He had career highs in points per game (12.1), rebounds per game (6.7) and three-pointers made (39).

Early life Lim was born in Singapore, the second of ten children of a poor fishmonger. He attended the Rangoon Road School and then the Raffles institution. Then he studied medicine at the University of Malaya. At university, he was a committed founder-member of the University Socialist Club (USC) and a leader of the university's student union. In 1953, he met former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, then a young lawyer helping to defend eight USC students charged for sedition by the British. They won the case and the USC rallied behind Lee Kuan Yew and his associates when they formed the People's Action Party (PAP) in 1954. Lim was a member of the PAP from its inception until 1961, and as its member campaigned in the 1955 and 1959 Singapore general elections. On 26 July 1961, thirteen left-wing PAP assemblymen who had abstained in a crucial vote of confidence for the government held five days earlier were expelled from the PAP. Lim left the PAP on his own accord and resigned from his government service doctor post in 1961. In the same year, he became a member of the Barisan Sosialis, a party which was formed in 1961 by the 13 expelled PAP assemblymen and 6 prominent left-leaning trade unions leaders. The Barisan Sosialis officially disbanded in 1988.The Straits Times, published on June 6, 2012Singapore Infopedia article on the Barisan Sosialis Political detention On 2 February 1963, along with over 110 other leftists and unionists, Lim was arrested during Operation Coldstore, a massive security crackdown ordered by the government and targeted at communists and alleged communists. Immediately after his arrest, he was detained without trial indefinitely under the Internal Security Act. At the time of his arrest he was only 32 years old and his son was just 5 months old. During his two-decade- long detention at Changi Prison, he constantly refused to repudiate his political beliefs despite being given every opportunity to do so. About 9 years into his detention, he was asked to sign a statement committing to support the democratic system in Singapore, and not to participate in politics. He refused, pointing out that the two demands were contradictory: if a democratic system really existed in Singapore, then there would be no reason for him to be deprived of his right to participate in politics. He was released from political detention on 6 September 1982 and was Singapore‚Äôs second-longest-serving political prisoner after Chia Thye Poh.Lim Hock Siew was a leader, and a true inspiration to all: Friends and relatives In 1980, Amnesty International issued a public statement naming Lim as a \\"prisoner of conscience.\\" Later life After his release from detention, Lim worked at the Rakyat Clinic (‰∫∫Ê∞ëËçØÊàø) along Balestier Road as a general practitioner, together with Dr Abu Bakar. He not only dispensed free medicine for poor patients, but also gave them transport money to go home. He repeatedly called for the abolition of the Internal Security Act (ISA). In September 2011, together with 15 former ISA detainees, he issued two joint statements calling for the abolition of the Act and the setting up of an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate the allegations made against ISA detainees. Lim also sued book publisher Editions Didier Millet, the National Library Board, Peter Lim and Tien Wah Press in 2011 over a news item in a book, Chronicle Of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News (1959-2009). Death Lim had been suffering from kidney failure for three years since 2009 but, according to his family, had otherwise been in good health until he bumped his head at home at the end of May 2012 and was sent to hospital. He was in stable condition at the Parkway East Hospital, but experienced a fatal heart attack at 10:30 PM on 4 June 2012. He was survived by his wife, a son and daughter-in-law, and a grandson. His funeral was held on 8 June 2012 and he was cremated on the same day at the crematorium at Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery.

Biography Jeroen Speak received undergraduate training in New Zealand. With the aid of the William Georgetti and Herbert Sutcliffe scholarships he completed a master's degree at Victoria University of Wellington, where he graduated in 1993. In 1994 he was the Composer in Residence at the Nelson School of Music before moving to Britain where he completed a D Phil at the University of Sussex under Michael Finnissy, he has also studied with John Young, and Jonathan Harvey. In 2004 he was awarded a place in the 'Visiting Arts' exchange programme with Taiwan where he developed his interests in Chinese and Taiwanese music and aesthetics. In 2005 he was awarded an 'Artist Links' fellowship by the British Council to further develop these interests in Shanghai, China. In 1992 he was the recipient of the ACL Yoshiro Irino Memorial Prize at the 14th Asian Composers' League Festival, in the same year he was awarded first place the Asia-Pacific Festival Competition for Young New Zealand Composers for his work Plagal Nuances. In 1998 he was awarded first place in the 19th ACL Festival young composers competition in Taiwan for his work Auxetos. The first New Zealander to have won the prize. He received the Philip Neil Memorial Prize from the University of Otago the following year for his work Etudes. His work has been played by Forum Music (Taiwan), ELISION Ensemble (Australia), Stroma (New Zealand) as well as soloists such as clarinetist Richard Haynes, and pianist Nicolas Hodges. In 2013-2014 he was Composer in Residence at the New Zealand School of Music. Style Speak's work can not be easily positioned in the standard European tradition, perhaps a legacy of his New Zealand roots and the influence of his interests in Chinese culture, his style is balanced between the ephemeral and the rigorous, characterised, in his own words, by ‚Äúpolemical internal musical debate, self contradictory behaviour, the simultaneous presentation of 'truth' with 'deceit', a continuous unification of opposites‚Äù. This dichotomy is reflected in his work 'Epeisodos', for solo E flat clarinet (1998), which, while rigorous in terms of its various systems of note and register generation, is also partly a transcription of an electroencephalograph of a patient suffering an epileptic seizure, and his piano trio 'Lingua e Realidade' (2007) which explores the Brazilian Vilem Flusser's ideas relating to the function and nature of language, and its focus on the pre-conceptual state just prior to symbolisation.

Blash started at RRC Walker Racing as a mechanic before joining Lotus in 1968 to work with Graham Hill. Into the early 1970s, he took up management responsibilities. Blash then left Lotus after a walk-out and was employed by Frank Williams to his Politoys team. By 1973, he was the team manager of the Brabham Formula One team working alongside Bernie Ecclestone and Gordon Murray until 1988. From late 1995 until the end of 2016, Blash was the FIA Deputy Race Director at Formula One Grand Prix races. Career When he was 17, Blash gained work at the RRC Walker Racing Team as a mechanic. He worked alongside Jo Siffert and Jo Bonnier who had experience in Formula One. In 1968, Blash became the race mechanic to Graham Hill at Lotus before working with Jochen Rindt a year later. On the day of the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix, Blash accidentally cut off parts of a newer, larger front wing from aluminium panels. When Chapman inspected the wings, he became enraged and demanded that the cars to be withdrawn from the race. In the end, Lotus ended up racing and all three cars retired. After the death of Rindt during qualifying at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, Blash took on responsibilities of management within Lotus until he walked out along with several employees. In 2010, 28 years after Chapman's death, Blash recalled \\"Mr. Chapman was the love God has for us.\\" He demanded of his staff use to self-abandonment. Blash: \\"I started on a Monday morning at Lotus. When I saw my apartment for the first time, it was Wednesday afternoon..\\" In 1973, Blash became the team manager for Brabham having worked on their Formula Two project. He worked alongside owner Bernie Ecclestone and designer Gordon Murray. His time at the team oversaw the world championship wins of Nelson Piquet in 1981 and 1983. Blash continued as team manager until 1988. Brabham was sold to Swiss financier Joachim Luhti and Blash left to join FOCA for 1989. Luhti would later be arrested and the Middlebridge Group bought the team and Blash returned as the Sporting Director to rebuild the team. His role helped to secure a supply of engines from Yamaha in 1991. Blash was offered a job with Yamaha and joined the company as their sporting director, overseeing its relationships with Jordan and later Tyrrell. At the same time, he was running Yamaha subsidiary Activa - which was housed in the old Brabham factory in Chessington. He still runs Activa - which does research and development and fabrication work for the motor racing industry. Since December 1995, Blash has also acted as the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s Deputy Race Director at all Grands Prix. On 5 July 2016 the FIA announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the 2016 season. Blash is now working with Yamaha.

He has been involved with the direction of science centres in Europe and the United States. He was instrumental in establishing the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris, and was head of scientific information and communication at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) for 10 years from 1982. Delac√¥te founded the Explorad√¥me in Paris and has held prominent posts at science centres in San Francisco, California and Bristol, England.  Biography  Delac√¥te's first name, Go√©ry, is possibly inspired by the founder of the commune of √âpinal. The town is close to Delac√¥te's birthplace of Anould.  Education  At an early stage of his schooling, Delac√¥te skipped two grades. This encouraged his interest in physics, because he \\"wasn't mature enough to really appreciate the literature and poetry\\". He said that he became interested in physics because he considered mathematics to be too abstract, and biology to be less scientific discipline. He studied at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS), with its highly regarded physics laboratories under Pierre Aigrain. He refused to take the compulsory postgraduate teaching exam, in preference to further education and research. There, he gained his PhD in solid-state physics, after finding it difficult to choose between condensed matter and particle/nuclear (the two dominant areas at the time). He chose organic crystals as his research area because of a desire to help less developed nations: by his reasoning, condensed matter physics was the less expensive of the two. Delac√¥te helped organise a science summer school for Algerian students in 1962. He then undertook his doctoral research at the University of Algiers, in association with the ENS and later taught at Paris Diderot University. In 1969 he returned to the ENS, where he became a professor after completing his doctorate.  Science centres  Delac√¥te led a working group on new methods of teaching physical sciences in schools. He was approached to join Maurice L√©vy's team in 1979 to help establish what was to become the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie. In doing so, he visited major museums in the United States. His work began as a part-time job, with him eventually becoming chief scientist there. In 1982 he was made director of scientific and technical information of the CNRS, creating the INIST in 1988. His ten-year period there included founding a new national library for research, an agency for communicating scientists' research to the public and a partnership with Google to provide free access to bibliographical references. In 1985 he became board chairman and scientific director of the Institut national de recherche p√©dagogique, where he remained until 1991. Inspired by the success of San Francisco's Exploratorium, Delac√¥te became friends with Frank Oppenheimer. Following Oppenheimer's death in 1985, he was headhunted to the Exploratorium, becoming Executive Director there from 1991 until 2005. During his tenure as Executive Director, Dr. Delac√¥te worked toward extending the reach of the museum through networking‚Äîincreasing outreach, expanding teacher professional development programs, creating an expanded Web presence, and supporting the formation of museum partnerships in the U.S. and abroad. He founded the Explorad√¥me in Paris in 1998. From 2005 until 2012 he was Chief Executive of the At-Bristol science centre. His September 2005 move there came about for personal reasons, with his family being in London and France. In an interview in 2006, he said that he wanted to concentrate on \\"the quality of the exhibits and activities, and developing a network of science centres across the UK\\". He also said that he was disappointed with the level of English government funding for science centres, considering arrangements in Scotland and Wales to be better. His time in Bristol has been credited by the French Ambassador to the UK with giving the centre a \\"completely new lease of life\\", by assembling teams including scientists and the best exhibit designers. In 2011 Delac√¥te was appointed by Cambridge Science Centre as chairman, the intention being to open a science centre in Cambridge. Upon leaving At-Bristol in 2012, he expected to return to France to develop a network of science centres similar to the Explorad√¥me.

Chief Runyenje was born in the R≈©gusa area of the Embu district, near the present day location of the town of R≈©nyenje's and its surrounding Runyenje's Constituency, which is named in honor of him. R≈©nyenje wa Mukobo The details of the process that saw R≈©nyenje become a Paramount Chief are not readily available, but sources within the family have it that he was recruited by the early European administrators who wanted to establish an administrative post around Runyenje's, initially to accompany them to Mbeere as a guide. On returning, he had won the confidence and trust of the Europeans owing to demonstrated ability and they installed him as a Chief. One of his surviving sons Karanja (Kƒ©thu) recently showed family members the exact place where the Chief was laid to rest back in 1939 the year he died. In addition to his administrative duties, the Chief was an elder among his people and a committed family man. He had more than ten wives and a host of elder friends and relations. Family sources trying to reconstruct their ancestral lineage trace the patriarch of the family as Mareru. Mareru had two sons M≈©tema and M≈©kobo. M≈©kobo had a son R≈©nyenje and a daughter Mwarwa M≈©kobo. These tows had cousins M≈©noi and Masaria. The two family branches have remained close to this day although many of the more recently born family members do not know each other yet. The Chief had thirteen (13) sons and many daughters. Today 17 August 2012, only Karanja (1918) and Matƒ© (1930) survive. Ngu≈© (1912) died on 8 January 2013 aged 100 years. Phares Njeru(1925) died in 2010 and is survived by his two wives, 12 children and their families. According to the Official Gazette of the Government of Kenya, Runyenje Wa Mukobo was nominated by the Government to serve as a member of the Embu District Local Native Council on 8 June 1925 and reappointed 14 June 1928. He also features in the list of Official Headmen for Kagaari Location on 12 September 1929. The family ancestral land is largely within the R≈©guca area near the Present day Runyenje's township which was earlier on known as Ngab≈©rƒ©.

He then became heir to the family's 16 manors in Somerset, Devon and Dorset. As a tenant-in- chief he became a ward of the king, who sold his wardship to his great-uncle Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester (1563-1625), Lord Deputy of Ireland.Yerby & Hunneyball; Arthur Chichester was the brother of Mary Chichester, wife of Richard Bluett (d.1614) On 16 April 1619 aged 15, he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, founded (posthumously) only nine years before in 1610 by his distant cousin Nicholas Wadham (died 1609) of Merryfield, Somerset and Edge, Branscombe, Devon. Nicholas's ancestor Sir William Wadham (died 1452) had married the other Chiselden co-heiress, Margaret Chiseldon, whose sister Maude Chiseldon had brought Holcombe Rogus to the Bluetts.Per ancestry of Wadham in Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.141, Wadham of Egge, Branscombe, Devon He presented a gold flagon to Wadham College which was melted down for coin tempore Charles I.Brooke-Webb, Michael, Holcombe Rogus, A Short Parish History from 958 AD, 2006, p.8 (Church booklet) In 1628 he was elected Member of Parliament for Tiverton, Devon. Marriage and children Bluett married Elizabeth Portman (1602-1636), whose effigy exists beside that of her husband under their canopied monument in the Bluett Chapel, Holcombe Rogus Church. She was a daughter of Sir John Portman, 1st Baronet (d.1612), of Orchard Portman in Somerset. They had no son and heir but eight daughters, none of whom were able to inherit the principle family estate of the Manor of Holcombe Rogus due to tail-male, but did inherit shares in the Rectories & Advowsons of Hockworthy, Burlescombe, Sampford Arundel and Holcombe Rogus. As well as the Hundred of Milverton, the Manors suchs as North Petherton, Greenham, Somerset Shippen, Chipstable in Somerset, The Manors of Sturminster Marshall and Holcombe Buhill in Holcombe Rogus (lands acquired by Sir Roger Bluett following the dissolution of the monasteries). Their kneeling effigies exist along the base of the monument to their parents at Holcombe Rogus. Of the eight daughters depicted, the eldest, 4th, 5th & 6th all carry skulls indicating they were dead by 1636.

Part of the Inwood Formation of the Manhattan Prong, it dates from the Late Cambrian to the Early Ordovician ages (~484 ma ago). It was first quarried on a large scale commercially in the village of Tuckahoe, New York. Deposits are also found in the Inwood area of Manhattan, New York City, in Eastchester, New York, and extending southward to parts of the Bronx, such as Kingsbridge, Mott Haven, Melrose and Tremont and Marble Hill. Other locations in Westchester County include Ossining, Hastings, and Thornwood.  Description and geology  Tuckahoe marble is a high quality marble first quarried on a large commercial scale in 1822 in the village of Tuckahoe in Westchester County. The marble is from the larger Inwood Formation or deposit, which stretches northeasterly from mid-Manhattan through southern Westchester and into western Connecticut.Tuckahoe Marble The marble is characterized scientifically as a dolomitic marble and varies in color from a light gray to light green, to a bluish white or brilliant white. A distinctive characteristic is the medium- to-coarse size of the calcite and dolomite particles that primarily compose the stone, which often contains minor amounts of hematite and pyrite. Oxidation of these iron-bearing minerals causes certain varieties of the marble to turn orange-brown when the stone is exposed to weather.  History  Tuckahoe Marble Quarries exhibit The vast majority of the early residential and commercial buildings in New York City were constructed with wood while government and institutional buildings and mansions of the wealthy were often built of brick or stone. Locally quarried Manhattan schist and sandstone from the lower Hudson Valley were typically used before marble became more popular. By the late 18th century, marble was being produced by a number of quarries in northern Manhattan and along the Hudson River in Westchester. The most well- known quarry that supplied stone from the deposit was in the area now known as Tuckahoe. This \\"Tuckahoe marble\\" was nearly pure white in color and considered by many to be of the highest grade. Many federal buildings destroyed by the British during the War of 1812 were rebuilt with Tuckahoe marble. The commercial marble industry first developed along the Bronx River. In 1818 the Tuckahoe Marble Quarry opened and eventually became a major producer of marble for the world. These local marble quarries were the main reason that the state government of New York chose Sing Sing as the site of a new prison in 1825.Crime Library profile of Sing Sing Prison From 1865 to 1871, hundreds of Scottish and Irish laborers blasted huge quantities of marble from the quarry at Hastings-on-Hudson. An inclined railroad carried it down to the quarry wharf on the Hudson River where it was dressed by skilled stonecutters and loaded onto ships and barges bound for New York City and beyond, as far as Charleston, South Carolina. By the 1880s, Hastings Pavement was producing the paving blocks used extensively in Central Park and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Between 1895 and 1900, Hastings Pavement produced 10 million such blocks and shipped them throughout the U.S. and to cities in Canada, Brazil and England. White Tuckahoe marble supplied the early United States with a building material suitable for the neoclassical architecture popular in America's early public buildings. Tuckahoe Marble was the single most important white marble deposit in the country until the latter part of the 1800s, when development of the railroad made the extensive, high quality marble deposits of southwestern Vermont more available. Quarrying of Tuckahoe marble ceased in 1930.

After the war, John Howison could no longer afford to keep Greenview, including the farm and dairy, and he sold it to his younger brother, Robert Reid Howison, a sometime lawyer and, later, a Presbyterian minister, who wrote and published a major history of Virginia in 1846, and renamed the house \\"Braehead.\\" It was a descendant of Robert Reid Howison who owned the house when it was sold in 2006. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in May 2000. It is noted for its distinctive characteristics of design and construction and for its historical significance. Braehead is a two-story brick building that is nine bays wide. The main part of the house is square with a two-story kitchen connected by a hyphen. The house has a double-pile (two rooms between the front and rear walls), sidepassage plan with hipped roofed entrance porticos on the east and west fa√ßades. Also on the property are two sites contributing to its historical significance: the ruins of a worked stone icehouse and the chimney base of an antebellum house. The house is within the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, General Robert E. Lee's headquarters were located near the home. On the morning of December 13, 1862 Lee had breakfast at Braehead.

One of the city's most prominent symbols, the belfry formerly housed a treasury and the municipal archives, and served as an observation post for spotting fires and other danger. A narrow, steep staircase, accessible by the public without any entry fee, leads to the top of the building, which nowadays leans about a bit to the west. The Belfry has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage since 1999. History The belfry was added to the main market square around 1307, when Courtray was prospering as an important centre of the Flemish cloth industry. The oldest part (the base) of the tower still dates back to this date. Because the original tower had stability problems, the top was shortened and replaced with a lower spire with four small spires on each corner. The tower, which nowadays is a free- standing tower in the middle of the Grote Mark (Main Market Square), used to be the main tower of the ‚Äò‚ÄòCloth hall‚Äô‚Äô, built in 1410 (see picture). When this Cloth hall became too small, a larger one was built on the location of the present Theatre Square (Schouwburgplein), the ‚ÄòLarge Halls‚Äô. As a result of this, te so-called ‚Äòold Halls‚Äô lost their original purpose, and c. 1550, they were transformed into 22 houses with a common courtyard. These houses were rebuilt in 1717. The Belfry with the Old Cloth Halls in 1897 With the intentions to create a healthier neighbourhood, the city authorities bought all the surrounding houses and from 1896 to 1896, the buildings were destroyed. In the initial plans, the Belfry would also have been destroyed, since it blocked the view towards the Tournai Street. Thanks to heavy protest from involved citizens, the tower was saved. After a thorough restoration by architect Joseph Vi√©rin, the belfry became a free-standing tower, a symbol of the city on its main public square. On the frontispiece, one can see the coat of arms of the city and a statue of Our Lady. The Roman god Mercurius on the spire of the belfry tower During the Second World War, the Belfry was only partly damaged, but it wasn‚Äôt until the 1950s that the bell tower was properly restored to its original glory. On the very top of the spire, one can see a golden statue of the Roman god Mercerius, the god of trade, which was added to the tower in 1712. Carillon upright=1.2 The bells in the tower regulated the lives of the city dwellers, announcing the time, fire alarms, work hours, and a variety of social, political, and religious events. Eventually a mechanism ensured the regular sounding of certain bells, for example indicating the hour. In the 16th century the tower received a carillon, allowing the bells to be played by means of a hand keyboard. Since then, a carilloneur often plays songs during Sundays, holidays and market days. After the restoration process in the 1950s, the new ‚Äòbell strikers‚Äô or Jacquemarts, a man called ‚ÄòManten‚Äô and a woman called ‚ÄòKalle‚Äô, were added in 1961 (made by Victor Cassiman) again (after they had been taken away after the Battle of Westrozebeke in 1382 to Dijon (France)). In 1994, a new carillon was installed in the Courtray Belfry. During summer months, there are often carillon concerts.  Literature  * Van Hoonacker, Egied, Duizend Kortrijkse straten, N.V.

Its red wine is a famous Cru Bourgeois ranked \\"Cru Bourgeois Exceptionnel\\" in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1932. The property is also a leader in enotourism.  History  Lithography of Ch√¢teau D'Agassac by L√©o Drouyn in 1865 According to a local tradition, a Latin inscription found in the underground galleries of the Ch√¢teau dates its construction back to the 13th century. But the first of its known lords was Guillaume-Raymond d'Agassac in 1172, Lord of Blanquefort. * Since 1238, the Gaillard de Gassac Family is owner of the seigniory of Agassac which extends more than 800 hectares. Its lord is vassal of king of England, Edward I of England, called in London in 1299 and took part in the defense of Borough in 1296. * In 1357, the seigneury was sold to the lordship of Albret and some members of the family came to Agassac as Arnaud Amadieu I, Charles II of Albret or Jean II of Albret. * From 1580 to 1841 (during three centuries (16th - 17th - 18th centuries)), the property belongs to Pommiers Family. One of its member was President of Guyenne Parliament house. In 1792 the first vines was planted and the winery created. * In 1841, the estate was purchased by Marcel Richier, one of the first big agricultural engineer in France. During the 19th century, wines of the property was sold abroad under Ch√¢teau Ludon and Ch√¢teau Pomi√®s. * In 1961 two members of Capbern-Gasqueton Family, Philippe Capbern-Gasqueton and Henry Capbern-Gasqueton, purchased Ch√¢teau D'Agassac. At the same time, Philippe Capbern-Gasqueton is the owner of Ch√¢teau Calon-S√©gur one of fourteen Troisi√®mes Crus Class√©s (Third Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 in Saint-Est√®phe and Ch√¢teau du Tertre one of eighteen Cinqui√®mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 in Saint-Est√®phe. * In 1996, the winery is purchased by the international insurance group Groupama. A very important renovation work was engaged to do of the estate one of the most beautiful properties of the Haut-M√©doc.  Geology and Terroir  The terroir of the estate is situated in the southern part of Ludon-M√©doc between two gravely outcrops and an area of sandy gravel. * The two gravely outcrops : Grand Terroir of the estate The first consists of extremely fine gravel from the river and very characteristic of the commune of Ludon-M√©doc. This gravely structure which can reach depths of up to 3 meters lends itself to ideal draining of water and results in a considerably early ripening of the grapes in this part of the vineyard, producing extremely refined and elegant wines. The second outcrop is made up of large Gunz gravel which forms a carpet much deeper than the first outcrop (+6m). However, given the greater proportion of clay, it lends itself to full-bodied wines with a more firm backbone. * The sandy gravel soils It results in supple, palatable wines with a harmonious presence of tannins and devoid of all sharpness.  Viticulture  Wine Storehouse * Area : 43 hectares * Grape varieties : Merlot 50% / Cabernet Sauvignon 47% / Cabernet Franc 3% * Average age of the vineyard : 25 years * Planting density : 6 700 shoots per hectare * Crop thinning, bud and leaf removal * Crop management : \\"Terra Vitis\\" and \\"Integrated Agriculture\\" certifications  Harvest/Winemaking  Fermenting Room * Harvest : The grapes are first sorted in the vineyard completed by a second sorting in the cellar * Winemaking : 23 temperature-controlled stainless steel vats with maceration (wine) for 3 to 4 weeks * Ageing : 12 to 15 months, 60% in new barrels and 40% in vats to keep fruity aromas * Coopers : Berthomieu, Cadus, Miquel, Doreau, Baron * Bottling in the estate : Fining with egg whites and light filtering  Wines  Ch√¢teau D'Agassac - Cru Bourgeois - 2007 D'Agassac is today one of the wines of the Haut-M√©doc with the best scores and the most awards : 2000 Vintage year : \\"One of the 100 best wines of the World\\" by the Wine Spectator s√©lection in United States (April 2003). The winery produces 5 various wines : * Ch√¢teau D'Agassac : Grand vin of the vineyard, Cru Bourgeois since 1932. * Ch√¢teau Pomi√®s-Agassac : second wine of the estate. * Ch√¢teau Pomi√®s-Agassac : the other second wine of the property. It is a selection of the finest batches used to produce the Ch√¢teau Pomi√®s-Agassac \\"classic\\" * L'Agassant D'Agassac : the second label of Ch√¢teau D'Agassac since 2006 made with 90% Merlot grapes. * Pr√©cision D'Agassac : a Vintage Cuv√©e produced only for great years since 2009.

He was to son of Otto, from whom he inherited the city of Lemgo. His control of the surrounding areas was initially uncertain. As late as 1368, the castellans of his castles and representatives of the cities of Horn, Detmold and Blomberg published a joint declaration, stating that in the future, they would only recognize the heir as their sovereign only if the two main cities in the Lordship, Lippstadt and Lemgo, would agree. In the ancestral lands around the cities of Lippstadt and Rheda, however, the situation was complicated, because after the death of his uncle Bernard V, around 1365, his widow Richarda had initially given his part of Lippe to Count Otto VI of Tecklenburg, who was the husband of her eldest daughter. In 1366, she had revoked the gift and acknowledged Simon III as her husband's heir. Otto VI, however, refused to return the gift. This led to a struggle that would last several decades. Matters were further complicated when Otto VI took Simon III prisoner in 1371. Simon III was released in 1374, but he had to pay a very high ransom. He ended up having to pledge half of Lippstadt in 1376 to the relatives of his mother, the House of La Marck. In 1379, a short-lived alliance consisting of the bishoprics of Paderborn, M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, the cities of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, and Count Engelbert III of the Marck conquered the Lordship and City of Rheda. However, they did not hand it to Simon III. Instead, they gave it back to Otto VI, after the latter had paid 8000 guilders. Around 1400, the cities of Barntrup and Salzuflen and Sternberg Castle were pledged to Simon III. In 1405, the rest of the County of Sternberg followed. In 1403, Simon III agreed a treaty of inheritance with the childless Count Herman VII of Everstein. However, the Dukes of Brunswick-L√ºneburg objected. They claimed that Everstein was a fief of Brunswick, and would therefore fall back to them when the Everstein family died out. In 1405, the conflict escalated to a feud, which was fought mostly on Lippe's territory. In 1408, Herman VII renounced his rights and gave Everstein to Brunswick. Simon III was married to Irmgard of Hoya and had seven children. He died in 1410 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Bernard VI.

Since the end of the Cold War, relations between the two countries have warmed significantly. Vietnam is sometimes referred to as the only communist military ally of the Philippines. Both nations have cooperated in the fields of education, tourism, agriculture, aquaculture, trade, and defense. Additionally, both nations have similar positions on the South China Sea issue, with Vietnam backing the Philippine victory in the ICC against China, and the Philippines backing to a certain extent the claim of Vietnam in the Paracels. Both nations have overlapping claims in the Spratlys, but have never made military confrontations as both view each other as diplomatic allies and ASEAN brethren.  Early history  Relations between the Philippines and Vietnam began centuries ago. There was proof that inhabitants of both countries were already involved in maritime trade prior to the arrival of Europeans. Ships from Luzon in the Philippine archipelago came to the great port of Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin to trade. Maritime trade relations were disrupted with the conquest of the Philippines by the Spaniards in the 16th century and the conquest of Vietnam by the French in the 19th century.Lim, Benito ed. Asian Studies. Quezon City: Asian Center, 1997. 57-68 Chams who migrated to Sulu were Orang Dampuan.https://tekalong.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/chps-1-3.pdf Champa and Sulu engaged in commerce with each other which resulted in merchant Chams settling in Sulu where they were known as Orang Dampuan from the 10th-13th centuries. The Orang Dampuan were slaughtered by envious native Sulu Buranuns due to the wealth of the Orang Dampuan. The Buranun were then subjected to retaliatory slaughter by the Orang Dampuan. Harmonious commerce between Sulu and the Orang Dampuan was later restored. The Yakans were descendants of the Taguima-based Orang Dampuan who came to Sulu from Champa. Sulu received civilization in its Indic form from the Orang Dampuan. Philippine-Vietnam relations during the Cold War Members of the Philippine Civic Action Group (PHILCAG) arriving in Tay Ninh who were assisting the South Vietnamese government in the Vietnam War. The Philippines was initially aligned with South Vietnam and provided them humanitarian aid in the Vietnam War. Before the Fall of Saigon, which preludes the disestablishment of South Vietnam, the Philippines was already preparing to establish relations with North Vietnam. President Marcos authorised his wife, First Lady Imelda Marcos, to make direct contacts while she was conducting state visits to Middle-eastern countries in early 1975. The communist takeover of Cambodia and the impending defeat of South Vietnamese forces led Manila to establish ties with Hanoi. The move was not seen as surprising as it was in line with Marcos' foreign policy to strengthen ties with socialist states in order to broaden economic and trade ties. On July 9, 1976, Vietnam Deputy Foreign Minister Phan Hien arrived in Manila to discuss the formal establishment of ties between the two countries. On July 12, 1976, formal relations were finally established with the Philippines the fourth country in the ASEAN to establish relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam after Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The Philippines and Vietnam opened their respective embassies in 1978. Among the first problems to test the relation between the two countries was the repatriation of 14 Filipinos and 10 Vietnamese families who were still in the city of H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, attempts of Vietnamese nationals to illegally enter the Philippines by claiming themselves to be members of Filipino families, and the involvement of Filipinos in the black market was received by the Philippine embassy. These issues hampered relations until the early 1980s. Post-Cold War relations Vietnamese Embassy in Manila President Benigno Aquino III (left) and President Nguyen Minh Triet during a bilateral meeting in 2010 Despite Vietnam's alignment with the Soviet Union and the Philippines with the United States during the Cold War, bilateral ties between the two countries can be recently described as friendly. On October 26, 2011, Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang made a state visit to the Philippines where he met with his Filipino counterpart, President Benigno Aquino III. The two countries signed four agreements on naval, coast guard and tourism as part of the Philippine-Vietnam Action Plan 2011-2016 framework. A Memorandum of Understanding agreement supported information sharing between the Philippine Navy and the Vietnam People's Navy. Despite being victims of Typhoon Haiyan themselves, although the damage Haiyan made to Vietnam was not so big like expected, the Vietnamese still donated to help the Philippines in its rehabilitation efforts after the natural disaster, through Vietnam Red Cross Society.  South China Sea disputes  The Philippines and Vietnam have territorial disputes over the Spratly Islands, among with Brunei, China, Malaysia, and Taiwan. The Philippines and Vietnam both disapprove of China's nine-dash map which China uses as justification of its claim in the South China Sea. Both countries were also committed to a multilateral diplomatic approach to the resolution of disputes in the South China Sea with the UNCLOS taken to account. In December 2015, pirates believed to be from the Moro Pirates, rogue Muslim Filipinos wanted for war crimes in the Philippines, murdered a Vietnamese fisherman in the South China which sparked a strong protest from the Vietnamese side. The event also sparked outrage from the Philippine side, who was persecuting the wanted criminals who may have been influenced by Islamic terrorism. Both Vietnam and the Philippines have upheld a variety of international agreements against terrorism in the region. In 2016, after a legal battle in The Hague, the International Court of Justice of the United Nations ruled in favor of all arguments of the Philippines against China's claims in the South China Sea, effectively destroying China's claims in the international legal arena. However, China waved the international court's ruling despite being a signatory on the respect to international laws and UNCLOS and sent more military vessels in the South China Sea, replacing corals reefs with man-made islands that house military bases and missile launchers. Vietnam formally supported the Philippines in its arbitration case against China regarding China's nine-dash claim over the South China Sea from start to the very end. In August 2017, Vietnam pushed for the inclusion of a stronger statement against Chinese movements in the South China Sea. In May 2019, after a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a civilian Filipino vessel and left 22 Filipino fishermen adrift and exposed to the elements, Vietnam sent a ship that successfully rescued the drowning Filipinos, gaining praise from the Philippine side.  Military ties  A Memorandum of Understanding agreement supported information sharing between the Philippine Navy and the Vietnam People's Navy. On November 23, 2014, two frigates from the Vietnamese People‚Äôs Navy made its first port call to the Philippines. Vessels HQ-011 Dinh Tien Hoang and HQ-012 Ly Thai To docked at the Manila South Harbor for a goodwill visit which lasted three days. The move was initiated by former President Benigno Aquino.

She was discovered by the film studios in 1938 and soon became one of the most popular screen stars, performing in about 30 films between 1938-1944, mostly musical comedies. She was active in war effort and gave many patriotic recitals during the last days of the WW II, when the Soviet troops were already capturing Budapest. As Hungary was taken, she had to fake her own suicide and flee the country, where she in fact was sentenced to prison in absentia by the pro-soviet authorities. She spent years in Italy (where she had also starred in a film), Argentina and USA, but her film career was sadly never revived, even though she remained popular on concert stage. As the political climate changed, she returned to Hungary in 1988. In 1993 the Superior Court of Hungary exonerated Ms. Szeleczky, stating that the 1947 conviction was based on fabricated charges. She was awarded the Cross of the Hungarian Republic. Miss Szeleczky died in 1999. The Hungarian Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of this beautiful actress and singer in 2015. An article, written by a Hungarian emigree Gy√∂rgy L√°z√°r in the USA, held the Hungarian Postal Service accountable for issuing a stamp with 'a fascist'. The article blames the actress for her involvement in the Hungarista movement and overlooks her status as a screen legend. Miss Szeleczky never agreed to those accusations, seeing herself as an entertainer who strove to boost the morale of the troops, performing at the front and in hospitals for the wounded soldiers. Moreover, there were Hungarian actresses who were great stars in Nazi Germany (notably Marika R√∂kk and Clara Tabody) and who participated in propaganda films throughout the war; yet they never had to face charges for their political activity, continued their film careers after the war and are still admired and recognized today as major screen stars of the past.

Education and early Army career  Martell attended Cheltenham College and Gordonstoun, before joining the British Army and serving in the Royal Engineers. He successfully completed the Royal Marines All Arms Commando Course, after which he first saw active service in the Persian Gulf during the first Gulf War. At the end of the war, he participated in Operation Safe Haven, one of the UK's first military-humanitarian efforts. Later tours included deployment to Bosnia and Northern Ireland as well as numerous military exercises overseas.  Post-Army career  Having trained as an Army bomb disposal specialist, Martell combined this with his interest in humanitarian efforts to start work with the British- based mine-clearance charity the HALO Trust. His postings have included Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique and the Republic of Georgia. He now specialises in helping communities affected by explosive remnants of war. In January 2011 he was awarded an MA in Post-Conflict Resolution, from the University of York, following work in Afghanistan and with the United Nations in Nepal. He is now a Captain in the Army Reserve (formerly the Territorial Army).  Adventure challenges  Martell's first major expedition was as a member of the three- man team 'Commando Joe', who took part in the 2005 Polar Challenge ski-race to the North Pole, finishing the 320-mile journey in a time of 9 days, 3 hours and 17 minutes. The following year he recruited three further Commandos to join him in rowing the North Atlantic Ocean between New York and Mevagissey, Cornwall, UK, in the boat Mount Spirit. The journey took 85 days and the team earned two Guinness World Records on completion. Together the two challenges raised more than ¬£250,000 for the Meningitis Trust.  Current challenges  On 4 May 2012 Martell departed Choshi, Japan, in his boat Blossom. He intends to row across the North Pacific Ocean to San Francisco, USA, to become the first person to make the crossing alone and wholly unsupported. Martell's first Pacific Ocean solo row was brought to a premature end in June 2012, after he encountered the downgraded Typhoon 'Mawar'. Martell and his boat, Blossom, was recovered from the ocean by a passing vessel, the MV Last Tycoon. Martell, with the support of Hesco, Frobishers, PACE Networks and Gloucester Biltong, will depart Japan in 2018, once again aboard his solo ocean rowing boat Blossom to cross the North Pacific Ocean.

His Checkerboard Trilogy, consisting of the works Go in Beauty (1956), The Bronc People (1958), and Portrait of an Artist with Twenty-Six Horses (1963) was included by literary critic Larry McCaffery in his list of the 20th Century's Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction.  Life  Eastlake was born of British parents in Brooklyn, and grew up in Caldwell, New Jersey. As an infant he and his older brother Gordon were sent to Bonnie Brae, an Episcopal boarding school in nearby Liberty Corners, New Jersey, which he called Prettyfields, which he features in his 1969 novel The Bamboo Bed. In the early 1940s, he worked at the Stanley Rose Bookstore in Los Angeles, California, which was a literary hangout for writers Nathanael West, Clifford Odets, Theodore Dreiser, William Saroyan, John Steinbeck et al. He also worked as a reporter, covering the story of a lynching in Mississippi, where he visited writer William Faulkner. In 1943 he married painter Martha Simpson (1898-1984). In 1942, Eastlake joined the U.S. Army, and was stationed at Camp MacArthur and Camp Ord in California, followed by Camp White in Oregon. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, all Japanese draftees in the U.S. Army were sent to Camp Ord, where Eastlake was given the job of \\"looking after them\\", writing \\"I never knew a more pro-American, patriotic group than those Japanese-American soldiers.\\" Eastlake would obligingly take photographs of them to send to their relatives \\"in the euphemistic 'relocation' camps.\\" Eventually the troops were placed into a separate combat unit and sent off to war. \\"They fought and died with the best of them while their parents languished in concentration camps,\\" Eastlake wrote. His frustration and anger over this experience are portrayed in his first novel Ishimoto's Land, which remains unpublished. \\"The publishers told me it was too early for a book about this American tragedy. The public is not ready for it yet.\\" Later Eastlake was transferred to a reinforcement company in England, where his job was \\"to process and instruct\\" newly arrived troops, including acclimatizing them to British customs. His unit then landed at Omaha Beach, after which he fought in France and Belgium, and was a platoon leader when wounded in the right shoulder in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge, receiving a steel plate that hampered movement of his arm. Though he was awarded the Bronze Star for his service, he repeatedly declined to talk about it; companion Marilyn Hill explained that he was embarrassed by the fact that it wasn't enemy fire that wounded him, but his own gun that had misfired, blasting shrapnel into his shoulder. After the war ended, Eastlake accepted an invitation to join an army buddy in Switzerland and start a small literary magazine. Unfortunately, the backer withdrew support after only one issue, so the Eastlakes moved to Paris, where Martha had lived once before as an art student. The literary magazine Essai contains Eastlake's first published story, Ishimoto's Land. In 1955 he bought a 400-acre ranch in the Jemez Mountains near Cuba, New Mexico, which became a mecca for writers Julian Huxley, Edward Abbey, Robert Creeley et al. Eastlake's 1965 book Castle Keep, about U.S. soldiers trying to defend a Belgian castle filled with art treasures during the 1944 Battle of the Bulge was made into the 1969 movie Castle Keep, directed by Sydney Pollack, starring Burt Lancaster, Patrick O'Neal, Jean-Pierre Aumont, Bruce Dern, and Peter Falk.

The battle resulted in the ousting of the rebels from Al-Haffah.  Background  Haffah is a Sunni Muslim town that lies in the foothills of the coastal mountains that form the heartland of Assad's Alawi sect. It is strategically located close to the port city of Latakia, as well as, the Turkish border which has been used by the rebels to smuggle people and supplies.  Event = Rebels capture Al-Haffah The fighting started on 5 June 2012, in Al-Haffah, when a large concentration of FSA rebels attacked and captured the town's police stations. Soon after, government forces surrounded the city and began an attack. The opposition claimed at least five government tanks and armoured personnel carriers were destroyed in the fighting. Clashes also broke out in the nearby villages of Bakas, Shirqaq, Babna, Al-Jankil, and Al-Dafil.  Army counter-attack  The fighting continued into the next day with government forces shelling the village of Shirqaq and continuing to assault Al-Haffah, where tanks and helicopters joined the fighting. The helicopters strafed suspected rebel positions. On the first day of the battle 33 people were killed: 22 soldiers, nine rebels and two civilians. On the second day seven people were killed due to the shelling, including one rebel fighter. By 7 June, a number of rebels retreated from Al- Haffah to the al-Ghab area under heavy helicopter fire, but not before they freed several prisoners, abducted a number of police officers and bulldozed the local police station and secret police offices. Army troop reinforcements arrived to the area on 10 June, and the military continued to bombard the town and surrounding villages for a sixth straight day. Most of the rebels retreated to the surrounding mountainous area around Al-Haffah, which is a Sunni Muslim enclave, and entrenched themselves. The next day, the US government reported that it feared the Syrian government was planning a new massacre in al-Haffah, where fighting had killed 68 soldiers, 29 civilians and 23 rebel fighters. The city continued to endure heavy shelling from the Army. The FSA reported the same day that they had moved civilians away from the city centre to protect them, but even the outskirts were shelled eventually.\\"Damascus accuses U.S. of encouraging massacres in Syria\\" . 12 June 2012.

The rebels claimed that heavy shelling of the town had caused significant damage to the area's infrastructure and shortages in water and electricity supplies. In addition, the FSA statement said the withdrawal from the town and its suburbs was to avoid another \\"massacre\\" and orders were reportedly given to FSA fighters to evacuate the injured and killed civilians, which included women and children.Syrian rebels say Haffa pullout tactical; NATO says intervention ‚Äònot right path‚Äô , al arabiya  Aftermath  UN observers were blocked from entering the city during the battle, but received reports of civilians trapped and unable to leave.

The men wear khaki shirts and shorts with long, dark- coloured socks. They all wear dark berets. Southern Rhodesia, then a self- governing colony of the United Kingdom, sent two military units to fight with the Commonwealth armed forces in the Malayan Emergency of 1948‚Äì60, which pitted the Commonwealth against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party. For two years, starting in March 1951, white Southern Rhodesian volunteers made up \\"C\\" Squadron of the Special Air Service (SAS). The Rhodesian African Rifles, in which black rank- and-filers and warrant officers were led by white officers, then served in Malaya from 1956 to 1958. Of the hundreds of Southern Rhodesians who served in Malaya, eight were killed. \\"C\\" Squadron, which was formed especially to serve in Malaya, was the first SAS unit from a British colony or dominion. Several veterans of the conflict, Peter Walls and Ron Reid-Daly John Hickman among them, subsequently held key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s. Background and outbreak of war alt=A scarred and bloodied man of Oriental appearance kneels on the ground. Beside him stands a man with an FN FAL battle rifle. A bayonet is fixed to the end of the rifle. The Malayan Emergency was a guerrilla war between the Federation of Malaya‚Äîa protectorate of Britain until August 1957, and part of the Commonwealth of Nations thereafter‚Äîand the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The MNLA sought to topple the Malayan government and force the British out, while the Commonwealth worked to prevent this. The conflict had its roots in the Second World War, in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking, and called themselves the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army. Soon after Japan was defeated, the communist fighters renamed themselves the Malayan National Liberation Army, and began to agitate against British rule. Using the arms that Britain had given them‚Äîwhich they had cached, and then subsequently retrieved‚Äîthey formed themselves into eight regiments, and began a campaign of Maoist-style rural subversion, their intent being to politicise the villagers and gain popular support, which they could then use to take control of Malayan cities. In March 1948, the MCP called on the Malayan people to rise up against the British. Three months later, on 16 June, MNLA guerrillas killed three British rubber plantation managers in Perak province. The British High Commissioner in Malaya, Sir Edward Gent, declared a state of emergency two days afterwards, marking the beginning of the Malayan Emergency. In addition to British and Malayan units and personnel, the Commonwealth forces in Malaya included Australians, New Zealanders, Gurkhas, Fijians, Nyasalanders, and Northern and Southern Rhodesians. Southern Rhodesia had been self-governing since 1923. It ran its own affairs in most matters, including defence, but it was still constitutionally bound to Whitehall insofar as foreign affairs were concerned. The Southern Rhodesian government was therefore able to exercise a large degree of independence militarily, though diplomatically it came under the British flag. \\"C\\" Squadron, Special Air Service (1951‚Äì53) alt=A map. See caption. The Special Air Service (SAS) commando unit was formed by the British Army in 1941, during the North African Campaign of the Second World War. Including some Southern Rhodesians in its ranks, it served for the rest of the conflict, also operating in Italy and on the European Western Front. It was disbanded by the British government in October 1945, and reinstituted in 1950 to serve in the Korean War. The situation in Korea had changed by the end of its three-month training period, however, and it was sent to Malaya instead. There it was placed under the command of a British officer, Major Mike Calvert. Early the following year, Calvert travelled to Southern Rhodesia on a recruitment visit. Roughly 1,000 white Southern Rhodesians, SAS veterans among them, volunteered to go to Malaya; from these, about 100 were chosen to form an all-Southern Rhodesian unit. This was the first SAS squadron from a British colony or dominion. Led by the 24-year-old Temporary Captain Peter Walls, the volunteers arrived in Malaya in March 1951. Walls was promoted to major soon after he and his men disembarked at Singapore. The SAS already had two Squadrons, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", so the Southern Rhodesians became \\"C\\" Squadron, known more informally as the Rhodesian SAS. Engaged largely in counter- insurgency warfare, the Southern Rhodesians became well-drilled in the relevant principles and doctrines. They noticeably bolstered the hitherto thinly spread ranks of the SAS in Malaya, and performed strongly in the eyes of their superiors, though British Major C L \\"Dare\\" Newell believed that their attitude towards \\"the aborigines\\" was colder than that of the British soldiers. Barbara Cole, who wrote a history of the Rhodesian SAS, says by contrast that the Rhodesians became close friends with the Fijians they served alongside, and spent far more time socialising with black and mixed-race soldiers off-duty than their British counterparts did. In March 1953, after serving their required two years in Malaya, the men of \\"C\\" Squadron returned home. They were replaced in 1955 by a squadron from New Zealand. Three members of \\"C\\" Squadron‚ÄîSergeant O H Ernst, and Corporals J B Davies and V E Visagie‚Äîwere killed while in Malaya. For his services during the emergency, Walls was awarded an MBE. Rhodesian African Rifles (1956‚Äì58)=Arrival in Malaya SS Empire Clyde, on which most of the Rhodesian African Rifles travelled to Malayaalt=An impressive ocean liner on the high seas, billowing steam as it goes Following the departure of \\"C\\" Squadron, Southern Rhodesia was uninvolved in Malaya until early 1956, when the 1st Battalion, the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) were tasked to relieve the Northern Rhodesia Regiment (NRR) in Johore province. Originally formed in 1916 as the Rhodesian Native Regiment, the RAR were, by Southern Rhodesian standards, an old and well-tried unit; they fought for Britain in East Africa during the First World War, and contributed to the Burma Campaign during the Second. The regiment's black soldiers and warrant officers, led by white officers, came from both Mashonaland and Matabeleland, with Mashonas in the majority. The Royal Australian Regiment was also present in Malaya, so to prevent confusion the Rhodesian African Rifles' acronym was temporarily changed to \\"RhAR\\". The regiment's advance party, made up of officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and warrant officers, left the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury by air on 13 February 1956. Their tortuous route took them through Nairobi, Aden, Karachi, and RAF Negombo (in Ceylon). After touching down in Singapore, the RhAR's advance party travelled to Kluang in Johore, where they spent three weeks in jungle training with the NRR. They then redeployed to Batu Pahat, where they camped with the Fiji Infantry Regiment. A spirit of camaraderie quickly developed between the Fijian and Southern Rhodesian soldiers. The RhAR officers and NCOs continued their acclimatisation with the local environment over the following weeks, assisted by the Fijians. The rest of the battalion travelled by sea aboard SS Empire Clyde, and reached Singapore on 26 April 1956. Soon after, the RhAR set up headquarters at Chaah, about north-west of the port city. MNLA and RhAR tactics By this stage of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas, which existed by basing themselves in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup. In Malaya, the RhAR comprised A, B, C and D Companies, each of which was split into three 32-man platoons. The white lieutenant commanding each platoon carried the weapon of his choice, usually a shotgun or an FN FAL battle rifle, and acted with the assistance of a black platoon sergeant and a black warrant officer. Under the lieutenant, three black corporals led a rifle section each. These consisted of the section leader (generally armed with a shotgun), a scout, a Bren gunner, a Patchett- Sterling machine-gunner, and up to seven FN FAL riflemen. When marching through thick jungle, an RhAR patrol moved in single file, with each trooper behind the man in front. The warrant officer followed close behind the lieutenant, ready to take over command if necessary, with the radio operator and medic with him. The platoon sergeant made up the rear. According to Second Lieutenant John Essex-Clark, an Australian-born officer who led an RhAR platoon in Malaya, these Southern Rhodesian units moved much faster in jungle conditions than those made up of British men. The black Southern Rhodesian soldiers were reportedly naturals when it came to tracking; many of them came from rural backgrounds, and had acquired relevant instincts and skills while growing up. RhAR operations in Malaya The RhAR patrolled around Johore from May to September 1956 without major incident. The rain of the Malayan monsoon season seemed endless to many of the battalion's men, and actual sightings of the communists were rare in the extreme. Even when the guerrillas were spotted, they almost invariably fled after a few shots. \\"We can but hope that the chaps will get a chance of seeing a CT [communist terrorist] for a change,\\" reported an RhAR officer in August; \\"they are all as keen as mustard to come to blows with them.\\" So determined were the RhAR's officers and men to come face to face with the enemy that they ambushed around the railway line at Bekok for seven nights in a row, starting on 30 October 1956. Patrols were led by a different officer each night, but there were no contacts. Around this time the British Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, operating in the Bahau area, about north-west of Bekok, reported to the RhAR that they had encountered the communist 32 Independent Platoon, led by Hor Lung, which was then heading south-east towards the Palong River. The RhAR therefore redeployed to intercept Hor Lung's men. On 9 November, a half-section of Southern Rhodesians led by Corporal Munyameni sighted 16 pack-laden guerrillas, marching east. On his own initiative, Munyameni attacked, catching the communists by surprise; the insurgents split up and fled, running in all directions. One fighter attempted to hide behind a tree, but was killed by RhAR rifle fire. On 17 November, the RhAR was withdrawn for a period of rest and recuperation (R&R;). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a shot through the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty. Starting in February 1957, the RhAR took part in Operations Cobble and Shoe. These were \\"food denial\\" operations, whereby efforts to deny supplies to the communists were to be redoubled. Patrols around the rubber plantations and the edges of the jungle were intensified. To prevent guerrilla supplies from north of the Rompin River from reaching the food denial areas to the south, covered by Operation Cobble, an RhAR platoon under Lieutenant David Heppenstall was posted to the area directly south of the river midway through the month. This action lasted from 21 February to 4 April 1957. There were few contacts, and only one communist was killed by Heppenstall's men, but a great deal of intelligence was secured regarding guerrilla organisation and supply routes. Over the next few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but contacts with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men. As it approached the end of its two-year commitment in Malaya, the RhAR continued its patrolling in Johore province without major incident until February 1958, when it returned to Rhodesia. Five of the regiment's number had been killed over the previous two years: Corporal Tavengwa, and Privates Joseph, Hunyani, Manuel and Mjikijelwa. Influence on the Rhodesian Bush War Two RhAR soldiers in 1976, during the alt=Two black soldiers work together to fix a machine-gun to the side of a vessel. Several veterans of Malaya proceeded to hold key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1970s, most prominently Walls and another member of \\"C\\" Squadron, Ron Reid-Daly. Walls reformed the all-white Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) into a commando battalion similar to the SAS during the mid-1960s, with Reid- Daly serving under him as regimental sergeant major. After leaving the RLI in 1967, Walls became head of the Rhodesian Army in 1972, and retained this role for the rest of the Bush War. Reid-Daly, meanwhile, formed and commanded the Selous Scouts pseudo-guerrilla regiment from 1973. The Selous Scouts concept was influenced by similar operations conducted by Special Branch in Malaya. Both the Rhodesian African Rifles and the Rhodesian SAS endured following Malaya, and served in the Bush War. The South African historian Jakkie Cilliers, writing about the Rhodesian Bush War, comments on the gulf between what he calls the \\"Malaya clique\\" and those lower-ranking Rhodesian soldiers in the field, the latter of whom underestimated the threat posed by the nationalist campaigns, having not previously encountered an insurgency situation. From the mid-1970s, officers such as Walls attempted to impress upon their contemporaries the similarity between the Rhodesian situation and the one they had experienced in Malaya. Operations in Malaya had been coordinated nationally, while in Rhodesia the Army, Air Force and Police were sometimes at odds with each other. To resolve this the Rhodesians created a supreme body called Combined Operations in 1977, influenced by similar posts in Malaya, with Walls at its head.

Beit-Hallahmi wrote: \\"There is a famous story, told during a meeting between Prime Minister Golda Meir and a group of Israeli writers in 1970. A Jew from Poland visited Palestine in the 1920s. On his return to Europe, he summarized his impressions by saying: 'The bride is beautiful, but she has got a bridegroom already.' Golda Meir responded by saying: 'And I thank God every night that the bridegroom was so weak, and the bride could be taken away from him.'\\"Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, Original Sins: Reflections on the History of Zionism and Israel (Palgrave Macmillan, 1992), p. 74. UCLA professor of political science and history Anthony Pagden told another version of the story in his Worlds at War: The 2,500-Year Struggle Between East and West (2008): \\"When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact- finding mission to Palestine, they famously reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.'

In 2012 an article by Shai Afsai was published in the academic journal Shofar asserting that the stories in which the phrase appears are unsubstantiated. Afsai contacted several scholars who repeated the stories but none were able to provide a primary source for them.Shai Afsai, ‚ÄúThe bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man‚Äù: Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth,\\" Shofar, Vol. 30, No. 3 (2012), pp. 35-61. Afsai argued that \\"those who tell the story never provide a primary source for it and often provide no source at all\\" and that \\"there has been no basis for recounting the story as a historical event that occurred during the early years of the Zionist movement. In short, the story is unsubstantiated and writers should not treat it as historical fact.\\" Afsai discussed Avi Shlaim, Anthony Pagden, Ghada Karmi, Mustapha Marrouchi, Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, Scott Hunt, Peter Rodgers, Karl Sabbagh and others as examples of those who treat the stories as verified historical events, and concluded: \\"The 'married to another man' story, in all of its various permutations, should not be considered authentic until a primary ‚Äî or at least early ‚Äî source is found that shows it to be so.\\" He also noted that some of the same points made \\"by telling the 'married to another man' story can be made by referring to actual historical documents and occurrences\\" instead, and mentioned the writings and observations of Zionist travelers such as Leo Motzkin, Israel Zangwill and Ahad Ha'am, and the Zionist settler Yitzhak Epstein.Shai Afsai, ‚ÄúThe bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man‚Äù: Historical Fabrication and an Anti-Zionist Myth,\\" Shofar, Vol. 30, No. 3 (2012), pp. 35-61.

They also paid remarkably little attention to the Arab population, simply noting their presence as one facet of the new environment with which they contended. For their own sanity, the new settlers needed to minimize the difficulties they faced and, in the case of the Arabs, it was also ideologically crucial to avoid any suggestion that they were simply replicating the Diaspora pattern of a Jewish minority existing at the sufferance of a majority non-Jewish host population.‚Äù Alan Dowty, ‚Äú‚ÄòA Question That Outweighs All Others‚Äô: Yitzhak Epstein and Zionist Recognition of the Arab Issue,‚Äù Israel Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1, (2001), p. 34.

She is the founder and leader of the environmental group ARGUS in Potsdam, Germany. She initiated the GDR- wide opposition network of environmental groups, which later converged in the Gr√ºne Liga. Stabe was born in 1955 in Templin, Mecklenburg. Her father, Dr. Siegfried Stabe, was detained by the Soviets in 1945. Later, he became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, a school principal and a representative in the East German People's Chamber. In 1975, during her studies of History and Russian at Humboldt University of Berlin, she was arrested because of a publication about the Soviet Gulags. From 1977 on, she worked as a teacher in Potsdam. In April 1988, she initiated the founding of the group ARGUS (Consortium for Environmental Protection and Urban Design), which she led until December, 1989. In the summer of 1988, she began to build a network of environmental groups. As her base she used the Cultural Association of the GDR, the only place where assembly was legal, under the scrutiny of the Stasi. In April 1988 she organized the first GDR- wide meeting of environmental groups at the Cultural Association, together with Matthias Platzeck and other members of the ARGUS group in Potsdam. In June 1989, she organized, the 1. Potsdamer Pfingsbergfest, a public gathering at which the Stasi counted 3000 visitors from all over the GDR, together with Wieland Eschenburg and Matthias Platzeck. She used administrative loopholes to circumvent a prohibition of the assembly. During the gathering, oppositional groups distributed information leaflets. A poster by graphic artist Bob Bahra and an information leaflet published by ARGUS helped to stop the demolition of Potsdam‚Äôs baroque city center, which had been planned by the leadership of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany). Because of her active role at Pfingstbergfest and other events that were critical of the system, Stabe was dismissed from the teaching profession in July 1989, for reasons of ‚Äúcounterrevolutionary activities‚Äù. On October 7, 1989 she organized, together with Matthias Platzeck, the second GDR-wide meeting. 124 representatives of environmental groups followed an ARGUS invitation to Potsdam‚Äôs Cultural Association. The GDR leadership could not forbid the meeting. Stabe had announced it as a festivity for the 40th anniversary of the GDR. On the evening of October 7, representatives of the environmental groups signed a declaration, expressing the need for political changes and human rights in the GDR. The declaration was sent to the press in East- and West Berlin. During the meeting on October 7, a small group of dissidents around Stabe and Platzeck planted the idea for an environmental organization that would exist independently from the Cultural Association. In October 1989, the founding appeal for a ‚ÄúGreen League‚Äù (Gr√ºne Liga) was drafted. On November 15, 1989, Carola Stabe, Matthias Platzeck and members of the ARGUS group organized the 1. Potsdamer Umweltnacht an event at Potsdam‚Äôs Karl Liebknecht Stadium. Here, they made their call for he founding of the Gr√ºne Liga public, in front of 3,000 people. From the middle of October 1989 on, Staube took part in talks towards the creation of a Green Party of the GDR. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, she became a founding member of the GDR‚Äôs Green Party on November 24, 1989. Simultaneously, she worked in the speakers‚Äô council of the Gr√ºne Liga to foster the collaboration between both groups. On December 5, 1989, she took part in the occupation of the Stasi headquarters in Potsdam. With a group of fellow dissidents she founded the Rat der Volkskontrolle, which organized the transition to a democratic system in Potsdam. At the Zentraler Runder Tisch (Central Round Table) in Berlin and at the Round Table in Potsdam she represented the Gr√ºne Liga. She partook in the organization of the founding congresses of the Gr√ºne Liga, as well as the Green Party. Her election into the federal board was prevented by the wrongful allegation that she had worked for the Stasi. Henry Schramm, the person who made the allegation, was later exposed as an agent of the Stasi, posing as a dissident in the opposition movement. From December 7 to April 30, 1990, she headed the office of Gr√ºne Liga in Potsdam and later in Berlin. From May 1990 to July 1992 she was the executive director of Gr√ºne Liga e. V. She supported the creation of environmental centers in the GDR‚Äôs 14 district cities and realized projects to build environmental counseling. She helped to prepare the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brasil for the Federal Republic of Germany. In September 1994 she was politically and professionally rehabilitated and started to work in Brandenburg against right-wing extremism, for democratic participation and for a critical assessment of GDR history. In 2005, with Bob Bahra, she founded the Forum zur kritischen Auseinandersetzung mit der DDR-Geschichte (Forum for the Critical Exploration of GDR History). Since 2006, she works with Stefan Roloff on the production of films and art projects dealing with the history of the GDR. In 2011 she founded the Gemeinschaft der Verfolgten des DDR-Systems (Association of the Persecuted of the GDR System), together with Bob Bahra, Sibylle Sch√∂nemann and Birgit Willsch√ºtz.

He also held various other high-ranking offices, including military governor of Upper Hungary and later royal commissioner of Transylvania.  Biography  He was born in the Neapolitan House of Carafa. He was introduced at the Kaiserhof in Vienna in 1655 by his cousin Cardinal Carlo Carafa della Spina. Later he entered the Imperial Army, and became a Colonel in 1672, when he participated in the War against the Turks in Hungary. During the Siege of Vienna (1683), he was sent by Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor to Warsaw, to urge Polish King John III Sobieski to come to the help of the city. In 1685, he took Pre≈°ov from the Turks. After the conquest of Upper Hungary, he was appointed its military governor. He set up the Executive Court of Pre≈°ov, by which he ruthlessly persecuted followers of Imre Th√∂k√∂ly; the Court, whose proceedings remained secret, made widespread use of torture and executed seventeen supposed conspirators. For this event, Caraffa developed a reputation for cruelty among Hungarians. The Hungarian nobility complained to the Emperor and Caraffa was given another position as General Commissary of the army. He remained in Imperial service and conquered Palanok Castle in Munk√°cs, defended by Ilona Zr√≠nyi after a siege of three years. In this way, he was appointed royal commissioner of Transylvania, and managed to persuade Michael Teleky and an important part of the nobility to switch to the Austrian side. He also conquered Lipova and Lugoj. His administration of Transylvania was also remembered as heavy-handed, for he extracted more taxes than the Ottomans had collected tribute. He played a very important role in the conquest of Belgrade in 1688, and was for this rewarded with the Order of the Golden Fleece and lands in Voƒáin, Slavonia. In 1691, he commanded the Austrian troops in the Nine Years' War in Italy. His deeds were chronicled by Giambattista Vico in De rebus gestis Antonj Caraphaei, first published in 1716 at the commission of Adriano Antonio Carafa (1696‚Äì1765).

He is eight-time national √©p√©e champion of Romania. Career Nyisztor took up fencing when he was nine years old, on medical advice: he was a sickly child and his doctor recommended his mother to take him to sport. His mother chose fencing because the hall was close to home. He grew bored quickly and started to play truant until his mother met his coach, Marcela Moldovan, who revealed he had not trained for a while. Nyisztor was summoned to give in his equipment. When he arrived to the hall he thought he would train one last time and eventually decided to go on. He practiced foil first, then turned to √©p√©e as well. He transferred to CS Cri»ôul Oradea in 1993 to follow his coach, while continuing his studies at his home city, Satu Mare. He began to train in √©p√©e under the coaching of Nicolae Ille. In 1994 he was asked to join both the national foil team in Satu Mare and the national √©p√©e team in Craiova. He opted for the latter. he earned a bronze medal at the 1996 Cadet World Championships in Tournai and at the 1999 Junior World Championships in Tournai. In the senior category Nyisztor posted a quarter-finals finish at the 2001 European Championships in Koblenz after he lost to Russia's Pavel Kolobkov, then another at the 2002 edition, losing this time to Hungary's G√°bor Boczk√≥. Nyisztor climbed his first World Cup podium with a bronze medal at the 2003 Bratislava Grand Prix, but he could not attend the 2003 World Championships because the Romanian Fencing Federation was late for registration. He however qualified to the individual event at the 2004 Summer Olympics through the European zone qualifier in Ghent, becoming the first male √©p√©e fencer to represent Romania at Olympic Games. For his Olympic d√©but he defeated Ukraine's Bohdan Nikishyn in the preliminary round, but lost to Italy's Alfredo Rota in the table of 32. Nyisztor posted another last-8 finish at the 2005 European Championships in Zalaegerszeg, after losing to Olympic champion Marcel Fischer. He reached the quarter-finals too at the 2006 World Championships in Turin, defeating the Netherlands' Bas Verwijlen and Ukraine's Maksym Khvorost along the way. He was defeated 12‚Äì15 by eventual World champion Lei Wang of China. This career high was followed by dry years: he did not reach the final table of 64 at the 2007 World Championships in St Petersburg and failed to qualify to the 2008 Summer Olympics. He took coaching duties for the junior team at CSM Oradea and as assistant coach to Nicolae Ille. In 2010 he left his club amid controversy that resulted from his behaviour at the Romanian national championship, where CSM Oradea lost their team title. He transferred afterwards to CSU T√¢rgu Mure»ô. In 2011 Nyisztor won the St Duje's Cup satellite tournament in Split, Croatia. He took part in the 2011 World Championships in Catania, but lost in the first round to Norway's Sturla Torkildsen.

This was an organization started in 2011 by Canadian women who protested Toronto's police public statements suggesting that women could avoid rape and sexual assault by the way they dressed. They have conducted events across the world for education about this issue. The first Besharmi Morcha took place in Bhopal on 17 July 2011, followed by Besharmi Morcha Delhi on 31 July 2011. Besharmi Morcha Lucknow took place on 21 August 2011. Besharmi Morcha Bangalore, coordinated to coincide with similar events in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong on 4 December 2011, was cancelled by police after they received objections. A police spokesperson said that groups opposing Besharmi Morcha had \\"threatened to hold a ‚Äòviolent protest‚Äô\\". Dhillan Mowli, one of the organisers, reported that she had been told that the event was ‚Äúnot part of Indian culture.‚Äù Mowli also said, \\"The vice-president of a women's organisation called me and said that if any women were seen in skimpy clothing during the Slutwalk, they would be beaten with brooms.\\" Christie Thompson, writing for Ms Magazine, observed \\"...women aren‚Äôt marching for the right to walk down the street dressed in barely-there clothes, as critics suggest. They‚Äôre fighting for the right to walk down the street. Period.\\" Translation Besharmi Morcha () is most often translated into English as \\"shameless protest\\" or \\"shameless front\\". It has also been translated as ‚ÄúMarch of the Shameless‚Äù and \\"Shameless Campaign\\". Besharmi Morcha was chosen as the name in India to address its diverse cultural aspects and languages. The word \\"slut\\" does not translate directly or equivalently into Indian languages such as Hindi. The nearest equivalent direct translation of slut is ran…ñii () meaning \\"prostitute\\". Organizers worried that observers would believe that protesters were identifying as prostitutes, or seeking the right to be prostitutes, rather than protesting to protect women's safety and achieve freedom from sexual violence. Besharmi () translates as shamelessly, brazenly and even boldly. It may imply a quality of obscenity or obscenely. Morcha () is closely linked to the idea of protest and action. It often indicates political protest and has military overtones. Besharmi Morcha has multiple meanings that are not readily translated into English. It is generally summed up as meaning \\"shamelessly and boldly protesting in a united way that others may see as wrong or even obscene\\".

Hero of the battle of ‚ÄúCiudad Bol√≠var‚Äù, which seals the pacification of Venezuela in 1903. Later, as head of a failed conspiracy against the primitive and long time dictator Juan Vicente G√≥mez he was imprisoned for 14 years in 1913, before attempting a brave naval invasion in 1929 to overthrow G√≥mez‚Äôs sanguinary regime and his Presidential front man, in which he fought and died rising the flag of freedom. Father of Carlos Delgado-Chalbaud, the best educated and most cultured president of Venezuelan modernity. Background and personal life He was born to General Miguel Delgado Brice√±o (son of Santos Rom√°n Delgado Abreu and Abigail Brice√±o Gabald√≥n, whose grandparent was an Andalusian colonist) and Dolores Chalbaud Calder√≥n (the daughter of Jos√© Antonio Chalbaud, a French immigrant, and Dolores Calder√≥n Carrillo). He was the father of Carlos Delgado Chalbaud venezuelatuya.com, Rom√°n Delgado Chalbaud (born 1909). Career Delgado entered the Venezuelan Naval Academy at Puerto Cabello, and by 1901 had obtained the rank of Captain. He was Commander in Chief of the Venezuelan Navy during the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora led by Manuel Antonio Matos against the government of Cipriano Castro. In 1906-7 he was involved with a group called \\"La Conjura\\" opposed to Juan Vicente G√≥mez, but nonetheless supported G√≥mez' 1908 coup against Castro. The following year Delgado founded the Compa√±√≠a An√≥nima de Navegaci√≥n Fluvial y Costanera, which controlled the entire maritime and river transport of Venezuela, with G√≥mez holding some shares. Delgado became sufficiently identified with gomecismo to be considered a possible successor to G√≥mez. In 1911 Delgado visited Europe to try to obtain financial support for a variety of development schemes in Venezuela. With some sectors of public opinion opposing the deals, G√≥mez, who had appeared to support them, opposed them. In 1913 he initiated a conspiracy against G√≥mez. This failed, and he was imprisoned for 14 years. 1929 invasion Following his release, Delgado moved to Paris, a center of Venezuelan exile organisation against G√≥mez, and helped organise a government-in-exile, the Junta de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, of which Santos Dominici was President and Alberto Smith Vice President. On the morning of 11 August 1929 Delgado led the steamship Falke (renamed General Anzo√°tegui for the occasion) into Cuman√°. Met by Venezuelan armed forces, the expeditionary force of 250-300 men soon ran into problems. Delgado was killed on the first day, and on 24 August, the leaders of the expedition surrendered.

Plot Pedro Solis (√Ålvaro Rudolphy) is a young lower-middle class waiter, known as Pelluco by his family and friends. One day he finds a man, Rodolfo Ruttenmeyer, identical to him. Without finding an explanation for the strange fact, Pelluco assumes the identity of Rodolfo, as he had an accident and lost his memory. Rodolfo is received and cared by Pelluco's family, who believes he is actually Pelluco. Pelluco, in the other hand, tries to find the answer to what he saw that day, while living as a businessman. He falls in love with Fernanda (√Ångela Contreras), the lover of his stepbrother Ignacio (Luciano Cruz-Coke). Fernanda cheats on Pelluco with his stepbrother, but when she discovers the new personality of her husband, she begins to feel a real affection for him. Ignacio, jealous of the success of Pelluco, searches for a way to humiliate him and take over his job as manager. Rodolfo, who remembers nothing, takes the place of Pelluco working at the Central Market of Santiago, where Pelluco used to work. Rodolfo's personality is totally different from Pelluco, who is more outgoing. Indeed, he learns that Betzab√© (Alejandra Fosalba), a girl from Pelluco's neighborhood, is pregnant, and she believes that Rodolfo is the father of her child. Pelluco and Rodolfo are actually twins, but Rodolfo was sold to a wealthy family because financial problems did not allow his family to keep both children. Mait√©n (Loreto Valenzuela) and \\"Chingao\\" (Mauricio Pesutic), parents of the twins, move to Santiago without knowing that their son Rodolfo is also in the city. Chingao is taken to prison for illegal business, but returns home when Rodolfo arrives. After many adventures and misunderstandings, the twins discover what had happened. Camilo Ruttenmeyer (Jaime Vadell), the company's owner, discovers Ignacio's plans to steal his money. While quarreling Ignacio menaces Rodolfo with a gun, he fires but accidentally the bullet hits Pelluco, who dies in hospital in the final episode.

Life and career = From Amiens to Paris  Victor-Ferdinand Bourgeois, born in Amiens on 1 August 1870,1 studied at the √âcole R√©gionale des Beaux-Arts de la Somme and at the Arts D√©coratifs in Paris, where he won major prizes. Assessed as hors- concours in 1892, he was appointed to the art directorship of the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres and joined the studio of Luc-Olivier Merson, who had just been elected to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. In the 1894 √âcole des Beaux-Arts competition Bourgeois came first of four hundred students and in 1897 won the Prix Chenavard, enabling him to participate in the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais the following year. Here he exhibited La ville d‚ÄôAmiens recevant les hommages de ses industries. The canvas was immediately acquired by the French government for Amiens Town Hall; this was his first and last public commission, a vast allegorical composition conforming to the iconography and style widely employed in public monuments of the Third Republic. Exhibited at the 1900 Exposition Internationale, it was awarded a bronze medal.  Naturalist painter and peintre de Salon  In the 1901 Salon Bourgeois exhibited Dur labeur. This imposing canvas of peat diggers is in the naturalist style popularised since the 1870s by L√©on Augustin Lhermitte and Jules Bastien-Lepage. He continued in this vein with his Portrait du p√®re de l‚Äôartiste en ouvrier, and his most ambitious realist work, the triptych Chez les Chouans, representing the universal themes of youth, family and old age. This portrayal of the peasant world, a representation of the working environment of the farmyard, is a clear departure from the tradition of historical painting.  Stay in Etaples  An admirer of Jules Breton, Bourgeois was also interested in the world of the sea. He visited √âtaples several times, where the port‚Äôs hustle and bustle offered him lively subjects, illustrated by canvases such as L‚ÄôArriv√©e du poisson and Retour des p√™cheuses de crevettes, exhibited respectively at the 1907 and 1908 Salons. Four years later Gaston Balande was to paint an analogous subject, confirming the attraction of √âtaples for naturalist painters.  Trip to Switzerland  His research into light found new expression in the technique of pastel. He first experimented with this new medium during a trip to Switzerland in the autumn of 1908 where, working outdoors, he produced a radiant series of pastels exhibited in February of the following year at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris.19 The French government immediately acquired Lac L√©man (Lake Geneva), a majestic and iconic scene depicted in a number of different versions, all concentrating on the shimmering expanse of water. From the village of Chexbres, with its fine views of the lake, Bourgeois drew the snow-capped peaks of the Alps and the tops of russet trees standing out sharply against the clear azure of the sky. His supreme mastery of pastel technique is further demonstrated by another fine work, his Sallance waterfall, drawn upstream from the lake itself.  With Armand Guillaumin in the Est√©rel  Armand Guillaumin invited Bourgeois to join him in southern France in the spring of 1911. Together they explored the French Riviera. Between the Bay of Agay and Le Trayas the bright red rocks, illuminated by the intense blue of the sea and the incomparable southern light, offered the two artists an exceptional panoramic subject and a chromatic impact that was utterly overwhelming for Bourgeois, as it had been for Guillaumin during his first visit in 1885. The red rocks‚Äô fiery display set alight the palette of this artist from Picardie in northern France. Bourgeois turned out many luminous rough drawings and sketches directly from nature there, later transformed into incandescent paintings and pastels.24 With their Fauvist touches, these works constituted a point of no return. Bourgeois had finally discovered the way forward. From that moment on he painted nature with the same eyes as Guillaumin, and, thanks to his colleague, tapped into the sensibility of Monet, Sisley, Gauguin and Othon Friesz, who all loved and celebrated light.  Dieulefit  After the loss of his second wife, Bourgeois married Jeanne Marthe Bertrand on 19 March 1928 and they moved together to Dieulefit where she was born. Subsequently, he rarely left his Proven√ßal retreat. One such retrospective was the 1926 Cinquantenaire de la Fondation des Prix du Salon et Bourses de Voyages (the 50th anniversary show commemorating this important institution) as well as the retrospective at the 1929 Salon d'Automne and another at the 1945 Salon d‚ÄôHiver, while in 1938 Le d√©part du bateau grec was selected by the Soci√©t√© Lyonnaise des Beaux-Arts to add lustre to its Salon. But apart from these rare appearances, none of his faithful friends, such as Paul Chabas, Georges Rouault and of course Guillaumin, managed to draw him away from the solitude of his studio in the Dauphin√©. Yet Bourgeois continued to paint, pursuing to his dying day an obsessive quest for light and transparency, as his landscapes of Dr√¥me and the Dauphin√© clearly show. A solitary personality but a talent fully acknowledged by critics and cherished by art lovers, Victor-Ferdinand Bourgeois died at Dieulefit on 6 October 1957.

He became the first black professional soccer coach in U.S. history in 1968 when he became the player/coach of the Washington Darts and he coached Howard University to two undefeated seasons and NCAA Championships. Phillips was a goalkeeper for Trinidad and Tobago's national team from 1963 to 1967, and with them won a bronze medal in the 1967 Pan American Games. He moved into American professional soccer, ending up with the Darts in 1969. That year he was the ASL's Coach of the Year and made the All-Star Team, while leading the team to the ASL Championship. In 1970, the team moved to the NASL and he was the league's top goalkeeper, setting NASL records for consecutive shutouts and consecutive minutes without allowing a goal, and made the All- Star Team again. That year the Darts had the best record and went to the Championship but lost it on a tiebreaker. He then left to become the full-time coach at Howard University, where the pay was better and they would allow him to go to classes for free. In his first season with the Bison, Phillips led Howard to the school's first-ever NCAA final four in any sport. The Bison lost to UCLA, 4-3. In 1971, he coached Howard to the 1971 NCAA Division I championship in soccer, making Howard the first historically black college to win it. However, the NCAA stripped Howard of its title for player-eligibility violations. Phillips then led Howard to win the NCAA title again in 1974, a title which they retained. In both seasons he was named Coach of the year. He left Howard with an impressive 117-19-11 record, and took them to the NCAA tournament eight times. He also earned a Bachelor's and master's degrees in physical education from Howard by 1978. Phillips left Howard in 1980 and then worked full-time for two years directing a local soccer camp before taking the position of athletic director at Newport Preparatory School in Kensington. During that time he was also a director of coaching for the Maryland State Youth Soccer Association for five years and a member of the U.S. Soccer Federation's national coaching staff. He then spent two seasons as the Head Coach/General Manager of the Maryland Bays of the ASL, coaching the team to the playoffs in the first season. From 1989-1994 he was the head coach of Virginia Commonwealth's soccer team, leading them to a top twenty ranking. He also served as the U.S. National Team Goalkeeper Coach from 1992‚Äì94, helping the squad qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He then became a FIFA Staff Goalkeeper instructor from 1994-05, conducting coaching development workshops for FIFA in the Caribbean and Asia. He left that position to become the technical director for the Trinidad and Tobago football Federation from 2005-2012, helping them qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Then he became the goalkeeper coach for Loyola University's women's team. He is the author of Goalkeeping: The Last Line of Defense: The First Line of Attack. He was once named the most outstanding goalkeeper in the Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago's goalkeeper of the century.

Following his role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he served twenty-one years in prison on charges of counterrevolutionary propaganda, incitement, and subversion. Of all Chinese pro-democracy activists from 1989, Li has spent the longest time in prison.Chan, Kaiyee (7 June 2012). \\"Bizarre 'suicide' in Hunan of June 4 leader is suspected murder\\". China Daily Mail. Retrieved 10 June 2012. On 6 June 2012, one year after his release from prison, and a few days after a television interview in which he continued to call for vindication of the Tiananmen Square protests, Li was found hanged in a hospital room. Shaoyang city authorities initially claimed suicide was the cause of death, but it was revised to 'accidental death' after the autopsy. Following a protest march attended by up to 25,000 people, Pan Democrats and senior establishment figures in Hong Kong publicly commented on the suspicious nature of the death, and said they had escalated the demands of citizens to politicians or \\"relevant departments\\" at national level for an independent investigation. The uproar in Hong Kong is said by commentators have put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to overshadow the impending visit of president Hu Jintao for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the handover of Hong Kong. Protests and imprisonment A worker in a glass factory, Li Wangyang set up a labour union under inspiration of the Democracy Wall in 1983. In 1989, China saw mass pro-democracy protests throughout the country, with the largest protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. After hundreds died when the People's Liberation Army suppressed the protests on 4 June, Li pasted a poster on a Shaoyang traffic sign urging a general strike in support of the protests. Two days later, Li organized a memorial for the victims. As a result of his actions, Li was jailed on 9 June for \\"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement\\".Chinese dissident found dead, family suspect foul play. Reuters, 6 June 2012 He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, but his sentence was increased to thirteen years when he appealed to the court. He was also sentenced to hard labour. As his health deteriorated, he was granted medical parole in June 1996, but the authorities cancelled his release after Deng Xiaoping died in 1997, fearing calls for the other responsible officials to be held accounted for the 4 June Massacre. In June 2000 Li was released again for reasons of poor health. Human Rights in China (HRIC) alleged that Li was tortured while in custody, resulting in his losing both his sight and hearing. Li himself said in his last interview that the only explanation for his becoming blind was through nerve damage caused by being repeatedly beaten about the head. During his spells in prison, Li was a frequent inmate in solitary confinement.Jacobs, Andrew (8 June 2012). \\"Chinese Activist‚Äôs Death Called Suicide, but Supporters Are Suspicious\\". The New York Times In 2001, Li began a hunger strike as part of a petition to authorities to repay his health care costs, and was given an additional ten-year sentence for \\"inciting subversion\\". Whilst attempting to force feed Li during his hunger strike, guards knocked out Li's front teeth. He finally gained freedom in May 2011, when he checked into Daxiang District Hospital to treat his medical conditions. His sister, who lived 7 km away from the hospital, visited him twice a day with his meals Li remained vocal in demanding vindication of the Tiananmen protesters up until his death: in an interview with i-CABLE broadcast four days before, he said \\"the souls of the martyrs deserve to finally find some peace\\". He advocated a multi-party democracy for his country, and said he did not regret his fight for a better China, \\"even had [he] been beheaded\\" In another interview, broadcast on French radio the eve of the 23rd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, he appealed to his compatriots \\"to observe 6-4\\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience. Apple Daily reported that he had no minders before the interviews. After his interviews were broadcast, Li was kept under around the clock surveillance by a team of 10 police officers. An account that was opened to receive donations from supporters from China and abroad to pay his medical fees was inexplicably blocked; he was also severely impeded from going to Beijing to see a specialist physician. Death Li was found dead on 6 June 2012, one year after his latest release from prison, in the Daxiang Hospital where he was being treated for heart disease and diabetes. Li was reportedly found on his feet with a strip of cloth tied around his neck and connected to a window bar. Li's next of kin, his sister Li Wangling and her husband Zhao Baozhu, rushed to the hospital shortly after they were telephoned at 6 am. His brother-in-law said that the body was \\"on its feet next to his bed, with a white strip of cloth tied tightly around its neck and connected to a window bar above\\". The authorities said to relatives that there would be an autopsy. Although the latter were denied permission to take photographs, some stills and one video made it onto the internet. Later, i-Cable television in Hong Kong reported that officials had been attempting to persuade Li's family members to cremate his body immediately.Siu, Phila; Agence France-Presse (8 June 2012). \\"Death probe calls snowball\\" .

The Wall Street Journal commented that Chinese activists on Twitter had begun to tweet their own declarations that they had no plans to commit suicide (); dissident Hu Jia recommended that fellow dissidents who are frequently arrested and political prisoners prepare a notarised statement declaring one's lack of intention to commit suicide.Chen, Te-Ping; Spegele, Brian (12 June 2012). \\"Protests Erupt Over Death of Tiananmen Dissident\\".

Retrieved 10 June 2012. Media reported that Li's family was under pressure to consent to an autopsy, and that police had given an ultimatum of noon on 8 June. Family members were denied access to the body since police removed it from the hospital. The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy conveyed that Li's next of kin were prepared to grant an autopsy subject to the presence of a lawyer from outside Shaoyang.Ng, Tze-wei; Cheung, Simpson (8 June 2012). \\"Answers demanded in activist's death\\". South China Morning Post. On 8 June, an autopsy of Li's body was carried out by authorities in Shaoyang, apparently against the wishes of his family, and the body was cremated on 9 June. According to the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, an unnamed member of staff at a funeral parlour implied that the government ordered the cremation; another worker told Cable TV that Li's sister and brother-in-law had given signed consent. According to Shaoyang city authorities, people on Li's wards saw him \\"acting strangely\\" by the window at around 3 am on the day he died. \\"Surveillance camera footage showed that on the night Li Wangyang died, no suspicious persons entered the ward except Li's wardmates and hospital staff ... The ward's door was not forced open\\", and there were no other bruises on his body. Shaoyang city authorities said the autopsy was conducted by four pathologists from the Sun Yat-sen University on 8 June. It is claimed that the entire process was videotaped and in the presence of the media, members of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The university is expected to report the autopsy within four days.

Amnesty International issued a statement urging the Chinese government to \\"thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding Li Wangyang's death and take seriously the claims made by his family and friends that this was not suicide\\". At the request of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), LabourStart launched a global online campaign demanding that the Chinese government open an investigation.  Response in Hong Kong  On 7 June, several Hong Kong organisations protested outside the Central Government Liaison Office. A candlelight vigil was held to commemorate the seventh day of Li's death. The death and its subsequent handling angered and sent shock waves through Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China rebuked claims that Li died of suicide. Its convener, Lee Cheuk-yan argued that Li never regretted support for democracy in the course of his imprisonment, and that his poor health condition did not allow him to hang himself under surveillance of National Security Guards. Kinseng Lam, who gave Li the last interview, called it an assassination and believed it was his interview that triggered the authorities to kill him. Alan Leong, Civic Party legislator in Hong Kong, suggested Li 'paid the price' for his interview with iCable TV.

Nevertheless, he defended the Central government, saying it was still uncertain whether Li's death was a suicide or a homicide.

The writer lamented that despite China's rise, she still languished third from last in world rankings in terms of respect for human rights. In a piece translated and published in the South China Morning Post, Chang Ping wrote that Li's death \\"exposed the relationship between the June 4 crackdown and the Chinese government's policy to 'maintain stability' ...

She said that \\"If these doubts can be resolved, and if some people are held responsible, Hong Kong people will have a better impression of the country.\\" She added that \\"Matters like these happen because the officials do not value the lives of the people, do not respect the rights of the people ‚Ä¶ do not have an in-depth understanding of accountability to the people.\\" Chief Executive-elect, CY Leung maintained his refusal to directly comment on Li's death, which was universally hailed as \\"suspicious\\".

At its peak in the early 20th century, the mill employed 85 workers and was the fifth largest flour mill in the Russian Empire. It now serves as a tourist attraction for visitors to Livny. History The mill was built in 1873 on the Bystraya Sosna River, a few kilometers outside the town of Livny. The mill was built by flour merchant Fedor Adamov, and designed by his son Michael, an architecture student at the Petrovsky Agricultural University. The mill relied on a water turbine to generate electricity. The initial design was a failure: on the mill's opening day, the turbine would not turn. Fedor Adamov, who had invested 5 million rubles in the project, was devastated by this failure and committed suicide that same day. The mill was subsequently redesigned and restarted. A dam was installed to raise the water level of the Sosna River, causing the mill village, which was rented by a merchant named Leonov, to be flooded. Leonov sued Michael Adamov (Fedor's son and heir) in court. The court found in Leonov's favor, ruling that Adamov knew his design could cause flooding, and awarded Leonov a large settlement, but this was overturned in the Moscow Court of Justice. By 1913, the mill employed 85 workers and produced over 9,000 tons of flour a year. Michael Adamov had taken over as master of the mill, and had become one of the wealthiest industrialists in pre-revolutionary Russia. He was known for his generosity to his workers, gifting them with 25 rubles for the birth of a child and giving holiday gifts from his many shops. The mill was profitable, ranked as fifth in volume of production of flour in the Russian Empire. It was equipped with efficient imported equipment for grinding and transporting flour. The mill's output was mostly exported. Adamov engaged in charitable activities, donating money for the a church and an outpatient clinic in Livny, a school in Uspenska, and a church in Kozminki. Following the Russian Revolution, Adamov's mill and its properties were appropriated by the state and given over to the local government. Adamov left for Yalta. An attempt was made to demolish the mill, but owing to a miscalculation involving the required dynamite, the demolition failed, leaving the facility damaged but standing. During the Soviet era, the mill was fitted with generators for electrical power generation, and served at times as an experimental hydroelectric station. During the 1960s and 1970s, plans were made to refit the plant as a flour mill, but these never materialized. Myths and legends The suicide of Fedor Adamov at the mill has sparked local legends that Adamov's ghost haunts the mill, and appears to the unwary, promising to show them a hidden treasure. The legend holds that such unwary visitors are never seen again. There are many blogs about ghostly encounters at the mill. Current condition Adamov's mill has stood 140 years on the banks of the Sosna River, bearing the constant barrage of weather, and has been largely unmaintained for the past four decades, leaving it in a state of disrepair that makes it hazardous for present day visitors.

Robbie Daw from Idolator felt that \\"Electric Chapel\\" surpassed the released singles from Born This Way in craftsmanship and praised the \\"hard rock ominous guitar riffs\\", calling them a tease.

Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote that \\"Electric Chapel\\" \\"pairs divine diva thump with a Van Halen guitar solo.\\" NME writer Dan Martin published a review on the song, confessing that \\"perhaps ['Electric Chapel'] nails the record's blood-and-chrome aesthetics most effectively of all.\\" In another review, Martin compared its opening riffs to Opus III's 1983 song \\"It's a Fine Day\\", with him further likening the recording to science fiction music. Kerri Mason from Billboard described the track as a \\"technicolor wedding\\" with a \\"fat guitar riff\\". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse praised the cut, feeling that \\"Gaga takes Born This Way to new levels of pop-dom on cuts like the jagged 'Electric Chapel' and 'Heavy Metal Lover'\\".

Bertrand Grell, who is the third of eleven children, grew up in Forest Reserve, St. Patrick, Trinidad. Throughout his childhood, Mr. Grell played soccer with his friends, and went on to train in the sport at the San Fernando Technical Institute while receiving his Third Year Special Certificate in Mechanical Engineering. He went on to a five-year apprenticeship with Texaco Trinidad Incorporated and joined their apprenticeship soccer team. After making the Trinidad National Team, Mr. Grell played in the 1967 Pan American games in Canada and won the Bronze medal. At the age of 24, Bert decided to leave home and migrate to Canada...only to find out that American scouts from Atlanta, Georgia had traveled to his hometown in Trinidad to make him an offer to play soccer professionally. He contacted the scouts and in 1968 was signed onto the Atlanta Chiefs (of the North American Soccer League which played in the summer) and the Washington Darts (of the American Soccer League which played in the fall). In 1968, Bert and his team, the Chiefs, won the NASL Championship. The Darts were the reason Bert first came to Washington; and he soon decided that this is where he wanted to make his home. He and his coach negotiated a trade with the Atlanta Chiefs so that Mr. Grell could stay in Washington, D.C. permanently. The Darts joined the NASL in 1970. In 1971 as a member of the Darts, Grell took part in the league's first ever indoor tournament, scoring no goals and earning two penalty minutes. Bert took a break from soccer in 1973 after deciding not to follow the Darts when the franchise moved to Miami, Florida. Bert joined the Washington Diplomats when they came to D.C. in 1974. He retired from professional soccer in 1976. In 1969, Bert Grell began his career with the Courts as a Bailiff in the Criminal Division. The team trainer, Frank Gabrielli, had informed him of a position at the courthouse since practice was at night and the players had the days free to pursue other endeavors. Bert then moved to a clerk position in the Budget and Finance Office. His self- discipline and hard work moved him through the Budget and Finance Office working as an Accountant Technician, Supervisor, Deputy Finance Revenue Officer, to his current position as Budget Analyst. Two of Bert's children have worked in the D.C. Courts, Bryan in Civil Division and Leyla, who still works in Family Court. Bert also played touch football with the Courthouse Dragons, the Courts'football team. Bert has been an active member of the Trinidad Tobago Association of D.C. since 1968, holding positions as parliamentarian and currently Treasurer. He also has been active in youth soccer by coaching the All-Stars Soccer Team from 1976-1986 and serving as the District of Columbia Youth Soccer Commissioner of Ward 4 in 1986. Bert believes that soccer taught him discipline, respect, and to have fun with what he was doing without expecting anything from it. The most memorable time for him during his soccer days were when he was playing in Trinidad just for the fun and love of the game without the worries money can bring. Other memories of travelling and meeting people from different countries put a smile on his face as well. When asked what he felt was his biggest accomplishment, Bert replied, \\"I left home as a young man not knowing what was in store for me and I was able to weather the storm and come out strong and successful. I grew a lot and learned a lot over the years.\\" Bert has always enjoyed working for the court system. The thing he loves most is being able to help see things get balanced and done properly.

Although he wrote one novel, he was primarily known for his vast output of short stories. Personal life=Early life Jack Ritchie was born in a room behind his father's tailor shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on February 26, 1922. After leaving high school, Ritchie was a student at the Milwaukee State Teachers College. During the Second World War, he enlisted in the U.S. army and was stationed in the Central Pacific for two years, serving for much of that period on the island of Kwajalein. It was here that he first discovered crime and mystery fiction. To pass the time, he read a large amount of mystery books and it was through this that he grew to love the genre. At the end of the war, Ritchie returned to his hometown of Milwaukee. After trying unsuccessfully to go back to college under the G.I. Bill, Ritchie worked for a time in his father's shop. Not wishing to pursue a tailor's career, Ritchie decided to try writing stories for a living. Ritchie's mother, Irma Reitci, also wrote short stories and she introduced him to a literary agent, Larry Sternig, to whom Jack gave a copy of a story he had just written. Sternig recognised Ritchie's writing ability at once and sold the story, \\"Always the Season\\", to the New York Daily News in 1953. Family Ritchie married a fellow writer, Rita Krohne, in 1954. Rita, under her married name, wrote a series of historical adventure novels for children. Jack and Rita Ritchie made their living from the combined income of their freelance writing, though Jack Ritchie stated that they never collaborated on any of their stories.[1] Ritchie and his wife lived in various Milwaukee locales throughout the 1950s. Their first home together was a secluded log cabin on Washington Island. With the birth of their first child in 1957, the Ritchies relocated to a larger house on the island. In 1964, they moved back to the mainland, living in a farmhouse just west of Jefferson and raising a family of four children.[2] While his wife took part-time work to supplement the family income, Jack dedicated himself to the writing of stories. Ritchie moved to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin after he and his wife divorced in 1978. Interests Ritchie was an avid reader of non- fiction books and had a particular interest in history. He was also a fan of word puzzles and did the crossword in the Milwaukee Journal religiously. When asked about influences on his work, Ritchie stated that he admired the writings of Agatha Christie, John D. MacDonald, Raymond Chandler, and Donald E. Westlake. Death Shortly after completing his only novel, Tiger Island, Jack Ritchie died of a heart attack at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Milwaukee. Ritchie was given a private, military funeral in Milwaukee on April 27, 1983. Short stories Jack Ritchie was a prolific writer of short stories, with his work appearing in an extraordinary variety of periodicals and newspapers. He contributed a number of \\"hard-boiled\\" stories to Manhunt magazine throughout the 1950s with other stories appearing in such diverse publications as The Philadelphia Inquirer, Stag, New York Daily Mirror, Smashing Detective Stories, and Good Housekeeping. Ultimately, Ritchie published well over 500 stories. The multiplicity of publications that purchased material from Ritchie can be explained by the fact that his lifelong agent, Larry Sternig, would promptly send out manuscripts whenever a new publication appeared on the scene. However, it was to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine that Ritchie sold more stories than any other periodical: 123 stories over a period of 23 years, 1959-1982. One of these tales, \\"The Green Heart\\", was adapted by director/star Elaine May into the cult movie classic A New Leaf co-starring Walter Matthau. \\"The Green Heart\\" was also adapted into a musical by Charles Busch and Rusty Magee. Other stories from AHMM were used in the popular television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Nearly all of Ritchie's stories have been reprinted in periodicals and anthologies, with one story, \\"For All the Rude People\\", being re-published 12 times. In the early 1970s, Ritchie created his two popular series characters, the vampire-sleuth Cardula, an anagram of Dracula, and Detective Henry Turnbuckle, both of whom went on to feature in some of Ritchie's best known stories. More television adaptations followed, with several stories serving as the basis for episodes of the show Tales of the Unexpected. One of Ritchie's stories, \\"The Absence of Emily\\", which won the Edgar Award in 1982, has been filmed twice. Throughout the 1970s, Ritchie continued to contribute stories to various publications, most often to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Ritchie was also a lifelong member of the Council for Wisconsin Writers, from which he won three awards for his short fiction. Ritchie's only novel,Tiger Island, was published in 1987, four years after his death, and other tales continued to be published posthumously, the most recent being \\"The Fabricator\\", which appeared in the May, 2009 issue of the Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine. Several prominent editors and authors in the mystery field who have praised Ritchie include Alfred Hitchcock, Donald E. Westlake, Anthony Boucher, Francis M. Nevins, Jr., and Edward D. Hoch.

However, despite the positive reception, the Hopper became the subject of a copyright lawsuit filed by major U.S. broadcasters shortly after its release, who questioned the legality of the AutoHop feature by considering it to be an attack on their business model. Although unsuccessful in its lawsuits against Dish Network, ABC (Disney), CBS and Fox Broadcasting Company have since used carriage agreements and other settlements to impose requirements for AutoHop to be disabled on their respective primetime programs for a period after their original air date. The Hopper with Sling model was the subject of a related controversy when its \\"Best in Show\\" award at CES was vetoed by CBS‚Äîwhose website CNET issued the award on behalf of CES organizers, because it was a party of active litigation with Dish Network. Due to the conflict of interest and its opinion of the device as being \\"pro-innovation and pro-consumer\\", CES organizers removed CNET from the \\"Best in Show\\" program, and reinstated the award. After a lawsuit which shut down Aereo (a service that allowed users to rent an antenna from a centralized location to watch over-the-air television online) as an unauthorized \\"public performance\\" of copyrighted television programming, Fox argued in court that the place-shifting functionality of Hopper with Sling was \\"virtually identical\\" and thus also a violation. However, its claim was rejected by the court.  Specifications  A Dish set- top-box, called Joey, used as a client for a Hopper The Hopper is powered by a Broadcom 7420 system-on-chip, and contains a 2-terabyte hard drive; part of the drive is reserved for automatic recordings and video on demand content. The Hopper contains three satellite tuners, and can be networked with up to 3 smaller set-top boxes, known as a Joey, as clients for whole-home DVR access; they are attached to the main Hopper unit via coaxial cable. It also includes an ethernet port, and eSATA and USB ports for attaching external storage. A ZigBee-based RF remote control is included. The Hopper with Sling model contains an upgraded Broadcom 7425 chip and built-in Wi-Fi, but is otherwise similar to the original model. In January 2014, Dish Network unveiled new \\"Super Joey\\" and wireless Joey units; the Super Joey contains two additional network ports, allowing users to record up to eight programs at once (four from the major networks, four from other channels). \\"Virtual Joey\\" apps were also unveiled for LG smart TVs, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, which allow the devices to act as set-top boxes. In January 2015, Dish Network unveiled a 4K ultra HD Joey for release in mid-2015, which can stream 4K video from a Hopper downloaded via satellite, has the ability to display two HD channels at once picture-in-picture, and has a thin form factor designed to be mounted behind a television. Dish also unveiled a new simplified remote control for the Hopper featuring a clickable touchpad and a microphone for voice commands: upon its release, it became standard with new installations, and is purchasable as an add-on for existing systems. In January 2016, Dish Network unveiled Hopper 3, a new revision with upgraded hardware, USB 3.0 support, 16 tuners, and a new \\"Sports Bar Mode\\" that displays a grid of multiple channels at once on 4K televisions.  Features  The Hopper provides standard television functionality, including an electronic program guide, picture-in- picture support, and digital video recorder functionality. The \\"Primetime Anytime\\" feature uses one of the three tuners on the unit to automatically record primetime programming being broadcast by the four major U.S. television networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) and presents them in a special menu; unless otherwise saved, these recordings are kept for 8 days. Internet-enabled apps on the Hopper on-launch included Blockbuster Video on Demand, CNBC, Facebook, MSNBC, Pandora Radio, Twitter, and The Weather Channel. In April 2012, a feature called \\"AutoHop\\" was added, which automatically edits commercial breaks out of the PrimeTime Anytime recordings. Due to contractual restrictions implemented since the launch of Hopper, AutoHop functionality is no longer available for ABC, CBS, or Fox programming within certain timeframes. With an optional adapter, the Hopper can be used with Slingbox for place-shifting. The Hopper with Sling model extends this ability as a built-in feature of the box itself, allowing the ability to watch live TV and DVR recordings online or through the Dish Anywhere mobile app for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, and the ability to \\"fling\\" video from a mobile device (such as videos or photos) onto the TV as well. The Dish Anywhere app also allows DVR recordings to be downloaded from the DVR to the smartphone or tablet for offline viewing, and the Dish Explorer app also provides control of the Hopper along with integration with social networks to track trends and reactions to a program. In July 2013, Dish Network introduced an SDK for developing third-party mobile apps that can integrate with the Hopper, and in September 2013, announced a partnership with Control4 to implement the ability to control and integrate with home automation systems through the device. In January 2017, Dish announced that Hopper would soon support pairing with Amazon Echo smart speakers, and that Hopper 2 and 3 models would support multi-room music streaming via DTS Play-Fi. Google Assistant support via Google Home was also added the following year.  Reception  The Hopper was critically praised by various technology publications; PC Magazine gave the Hopper an \\"Excellent\\" rating of 4.5 out of 5, concluding that \\"It only has three tuners to the TiVo Elite's four and it doesn't suggest and automatically populate your DVR schedule based on your watching habits, but its price, clean design, and easy support for multi-room DVR make it a must-have for Dish Network subscribers.\\" Engadget was similarly positive; despite noticing issues with certain aspects of its user interface, \\"all that being said, things will get much more interesting when other providers get on the whole-home DVR game and start to offer as many TV anywhere options as Dish, but for now the Hopper offers some unique, desirable features that you just can't get anywhere else.\\" PC Magazine gave the Hopper with Sling version a 5 out of 5, for \\"[packing] a staggering array of features into a single box that comes free with a Dish Network subscription package, and lets you watch satellite TV programming at home or anywhere you have an Internet connection. It easily earns our enthusiastic recommendation.\\" CNET praised the Hopper with Sling for being cutting-edge technology that \\"helps Dish make a strong case that its HD DVR is the most advanced out there.\\" It subsequently nominated the new Hopper for the CES Best in Show award (which was decided by CNET), and had won the award based on the original vote of CNET's staff. However, CNET's parent company CBS Corporation vetoed the results and disqualified the device for legal reasons.  AutoHop lawsuits  The AutoHop functionality of the Hopper was met with considerable legal controversy from the owners of the four major U.S. networks. Leslie Moonves, CBS chief executive, asked rhetorically how he is to produce CSI without the revenue stream of commercials. News Corporation refused to accept Dish advertising for the device. A Forrester Research analyst said the move demonstrated Dish's desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the Internet. On May 24, 2012, Dish and the networks filed suit in federal court, the Dish case in Manhattan and the networks' cases in Los Angeles. On May 30, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the networks' cases should not be filed in Los Angeles and asked for comments on a possible move of all cases to New York. In the midst of the lawsuit, small-market television station owner Hoak Media Corporation pulled its 14 local stations from Dish Network on June 6, 2012, demanding a 200 percent increase in carriage fees and the dropping of the AutoHop feature. David Shull, Dish senior vice president of programming, accused Hoak of effectively telling Dish's customers that they must watch commercials, disrespecting customer control over its services. Eight days later, the two companies announced a distribution deal. Terms were not disclosed. At a \\"Future of Video\\" hearing with the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology on June 27, 2012, Charlie Ergen made further remarks defending the legality of the Hopper and AutoHop, stating that the service \\"[does] nothing more than improving upon existing, legally accepted, and widely available technologies\\". He also remarked that with the feature, \\"allowing your kids to watch TV doesn‚Äôt have to mean they have no choice but to see commercials for junk food and alcohol.\\" The next day, Michael Petricone of the Consumer Electronics Association spoke to the subcommittee, likening Hopper to earlier time shifting devices, and stating that the device would encourage people to watch TV more. In preliminary judgement on July 9, Swain denied Dish's request to set aside the issue of copyright violations, ruling that Dish's argument lacked specificity. She also ruled that the case could be heard in Los Angeles, thereby eliminating New York as a potential venue. On November 7, 2012, the United States District Court for the Central District of California denied Fox's motion for preliminary injunction for the reasons mainly because PTAT and AutoHop did not infringe copyrights and did not breach the contract; and while QA copies constituted a copyright infringement and breached the contract, the harm from the copies was not irreparable, but was compensable with money. Fox appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 24, 2013, the Ninth Circuit reviewed the district court's decision with a very deferential standard of review, and affirmed it. In March 2014, Disney dropped its lawsuit against Dish Network with the signing of a comprehensive carriage deal for its networks (along with several new networks, such as Disney Junior, Longhorn Network, and SEC Network), including high definition feeds and TV Everywhere access for the networks and ABC owned-and-operated stations, and the ability to distribute their networks on a planned over-the-top internet television service. As a condition of the new deal, Dish Network agreed to disable the ability to use AutoHop on ABC programming within 72 hours of its original airing. In June 2014, following a court decision which ruled that Aereo‚Äîa service which allowed users to rent an antenna to stream over-the-air television channels over the internet‚Äîwas engaging in an unauthorized public performance of copyrighted television programming, Fox also argued to the Ninth Circuit that the place-shifting functionality of the Hopper with Sling boxes constituted \\"virtually identical\\" practices, \\"albeit also in violation of an express contractual prohibition\\", and that Dish \\"repeatedly raised\\" a defense that it was merely a provider of equipment and not the content streamed using it‚Äîwhich had been rejected during the Aereo case. Dish objected to Fox's claim, stating that \\"customers pay for the right to receive works, with Fox‚Äôs authorization, and do receive them at home before sending them to themselves,\\" and that the device was not centrally controlled. The Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of Dish Network, finding that Fox had \\"not shown a likelihood that Dish Network‚Äôs 'Dish Anywhere' and 'Hopper Transfers' technology would irreparably harm Fox before final adjudication\\", and in response to the claims regarding the Sling functionality, that \\"the Supreme court has all sorts of caveats in the opinion about how this was about Aereo and nothing else and a lot of the 'nothing elses' seem to be pretty similar to Slingbox.\\" In December 2014, Dish Network reached a new carriage deal with CBS, restricting the use of AutoHop on CBS programming for seven days after its original airing. In February 2016, a similar settlement was made with Fox, in which AutoHop cannot be used on Fox programming for seven days after its original airing.  CES Best in Show controversy  At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, the staff of CNET‚Äîa technology news website owned by the CBS Interactive division of CBS, voted for the show's official Best in Show award on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). CNET had named the Hopper with Sling as its winner; however, CBS abruptly disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results because the company was in active litigation with Dish Network. CNET also announced that it was no longer allowed to review products and services by companies that are in litigation with CBS. The new results subsequently gave the Best in Show award to the Razer Edge tablet instead. Dish Network CEO Joe Clayton said that the company was \\"saddened that CNET‚Äôs staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS‚Äô heavy handed tactics.\\" On January 14, 2013, editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine addressed the situation, stating that CNET's staff were in an \\"impossible\\" situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the situation, and promised that she would do everything within her power to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted one CNET senior writer, Greg Sandoval, to resign. The decision also drew the ire of staff from the CEA; CEO Gary Shapiro criticized the decision in a USA Today op-ed column and a statement by the CEA, stating that \\"making television easier to watch is not against the law. It is simply pro-innovation and pro- consumer.\\" Shapiro felt that the decision also hurt the confidence of CNET's readers and staff, \\"destroying its reputation for editorial integrity in an attempt to eliminate a new market competitor.\\" As a result of the controversy and fearing damage to the show's brand, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (the position would be offered to other technology publications), and the \\"Best in Show\\" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.

History  Zagreb Holding was established in 2006, but the history of its services goes back to the second half of the 19th century when first utilities' companies were established in Zagreb. Condition of communal infrastructure is the most important indicator of development in any city, and Zagreb's state of communal affairs shows that the city is part of European capitals for more than 100 years. First Zagreb's utilities' company that was established was Plinara - in 1862. Other Zagreb's utilities' companies were established in the first half of the 20th century. Rapid growth of the city and the city infrastructure, as well as a rapid rise in population, forced city administration to establish other utilities' and communal companies.

In 2007 the company changes its name into Zagreb Holding ltd.  Mission  To efficiently provide utilities' and other services, using responsible corporate business practices.

The coat of arms of the town of O√±ati reflects the families that have had historical relevance. It is divided into three parts. In the upper two are represented, on the left an eagle as a symbol of the Gamboine family of the Garibai, the Eagles; In the right a deer is represented in the attitude of running, as a symbol of the Oro√±ina family of the Murgu√≠a, the Deer. The lower quarter is occupied by a wounded deer on a wheat field and on it an eagle with its claws and beak eating at the heart. This symbolizes a medieval battle that was lost by the O√±acinos, in which the Murgu√≠a were exterminated. Formerly it had the legend \\" Zara bay. - Zeren bay? - \\"Gari bay \\" (\\"Pledge yourself! - To who? - The wheat\\").

Key: Dreipunktauflage = 3-point support, Zwischenmauerwerkauflage = pier support, Jochauflagen = bay supports or trilithons, Vorraum = antechamber or forecourt, Windfang = porch The great dolmen or grand dolmenBakker, JA (1992). The Dutch Hunebedden, University of Michigan. (, ) is a type of megalithic site of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK) that occurs in Nordic megalith architecture, primarily in the east of what is now German Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, and which has two different types of entrance. Neolithic monuments are features of the culture and ideology of Neolithic communities. Their evolution and function act as indicators of social development.J. M√ºller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15 The type of site, called Stordysse in Danish, does not follow the criteria listed below. In Germany, dolmens with three or more capstones are described as great dolmens and are divided into: * Great dolmens with an antechamber (Vorraum) * Great dolmens with a porch (Windfang) The porch dolmen is mainly found on the island of R√ºgen and on the mainland opposite the island. The antechamber dolmen is found southeast of that, between Demmin and the island of Usedom. Several variant, but very rare examples recall the extended or polygonal dolmen types. In Mecklenburg there are 146 great dolmens, of which Ewald Schuldt has investigated 44. There are also two great dolmens in Schleswig-Holstein (Wees, Flensburg county and in Nebel auf Amrum), several in western Lower Saxony, but quite a few in Saxony- Anhalt (e.g. L√ºdelsen 3). Since the width of northern megalith sites is limited due to the source material used, the main design aim of their longitudinal extension was an effort to increase the size of the chambers. Great dolmens reach an average interior size of 14 cubic metres, a scale only otherwise matched by that of the gallery and passage grave. Great dolmens have up to five capstones lying on eight to twelve supporting stones. Several great dolmens were extended using wide piers (Zwischenmauerwerk), on which, in certain cases, even capstones may have been placed. Like passage graves, great dolmens are a type of layout, in which the centre capstones were sometimes placed in a bay configuration (Jochbauweise, see picture). Whilst, initially, the roof was only built in such a way that its structural stability was based on a three-point support, in the later bay designs, a capstone could be supported on just two uprights (forming a single bay), the three stones being built as one unit, like a trilithon. The 44 great dolmens that have been investigated were found in various configurations. Five were surrounded by rectangular and 8 by trapezoidal frames of standing stones; 4 were buried under circular mounds, but the majority, 26, were under mounds covered by boulders. In one case, the type of mound was not known because it had been removed. The trapezoidally-framed dolmens (e.g. Dwasieden, , , Nadelitz, , ) have guardian stones, sometimes at both ends. The great dolmen of Gaarzerhof, which initially lay within a very short rectangular frame, was eventually covered with a circular mound.

Accessed on 15 December 2011. Military career When the attack phase of the Continuation War started, Gerdt was serving as the runner of the chief of the machine gun unit. Gerdt had to maintain contact with the chief of his company in severe artillery fire during the P√§√§si√§isvaara battle on 1 July 1941. He was wounded in the head on the same day, but returned to his unit as a junior envoy officer in August. During the Mensuvaara battles in August 1941, Gerdt had to maintain contact with the chief of the machine gun unit and the chief of the rifle company in severe conditions and repeatedly had to act independently. Gerdt's exemplary action allowed the rifle company to proceed across a plain that was being heavily bombarded by the enemy. When the enemy made a surprise attack, Gerdt voluntarily went to seek help from the artillery. During the trip, Gerdt was forced to cross a difficult spot of terrain, which was under enemy fire from 10 machine guns, over 10 light machine guns and a submachine gun, while at the same time being bombarded by heavy mortars. With this action, Gerdt saved his company from heavy losses. During the Sevastopol base battles on Karelian isthmus in July 1942, Gerdt served as the runner of the chief of the 12th company of the infantry regiment 7, but also voluntarily participated in the counter-attack. Armed with a submachine gun, he opened a route at the front of the attack, killing several enemies. Gerdt again proceeded at the front when the platoon received a new direction of action. His actions influenced the conquest of the tip of the base. During the battle, Gerdt also took five prisoners. Gerdt participated in reclaiming the Sevastopol base from the enemy. During the third conflict on 21 July, Gerdt found his superior officer, Captain Caj Toffer, lying severely wounded on a spot of terrain that had been bombarded with grenades. Gerdt carried the mortally wounded Toffer to safety, ignoring the severe and continuous artillery fire. Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim appointed Gerdt as one of his knights on the same day. Gerdt returned to battle, but was wounded in the face by a bullet the size of a fingertip. In military hospital, Gerdt received news that he had been promoted to Sergeant and awarded the Mannerheim Cross. Gerdt was sent to Reserve Officer School in Niinisalo after lying in hospital for four months. Gerdt participated in heavy battles in Siiranm√§ki in June 1944, where he was wounded for a third time. Before being wounded, Gerdt, now having the rank of a Second Lieutenant, commanded a stub- sized platoon, which made successful counter-attacks to drive off the enemy. Gerdt became well in hospital and could return to his regiment after the √Ñyr√§p√§√§-Vuosalmi battles. He was sent home on 13 November 1944. A proposal to award Gerdt the Mannerheim Cross, signed by the chief of the Kannas Group, Lieutenant General Harald √ñhquist on 24 July 1942, was sent to the military headquarters as a Creed message. A written proposal, signed by the chief of the 2nd Division, Major General Armas-Eino Martola and confirmed by the chief of the division staff, Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Ehrnrooth, was registered at the military headquarters on 27 July 1942. During the presentation given by the chief of staff, √ñhquist's proposal to award Gerdt the Mannerheim Cross was supported. Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim awarded Gerdt the Mannerheim Cross, appointing him as Knight of the Mannerheim Cross #95, on 8 September 1942. During the Continuation War, Gerdt was promoted from Junior Sergeant to Second Lieutenant. He was finally promoted to Captain in 1968, serving in the reserve. After the war Gerdt married Lea Marjatta Kosonen (1925‚Äì2013) on 9 June 1946. They had two children.Ilta-Sanomien erikoislehti Marskin ritarit (ollut myynniss√§ 3.11.2011 alkaen) sivu 9Kuolinilmoitus, Helsingin Sanomat 10.2.2013 sivu 32 Gerdt worked as the office manager of Oy Kaukas Ab and Kymmene Oy in Lappeenranta from 1971 to 1987.

Biography  Ren√© Fontayne's artistic career began to take off during the fertile period between the two world wars. Born in Verg√®ze, in the Gard, on 3 January 1891, he graduated from the √âcole Municipale des Beaux- Arts de N√Æmes in 1910, and in 1912 went to Paris on a national scholarship to further his talent as a painter and decorative artist, a talent that would come to be especially active and appreciated in the field of decorative arts. His first-known works date from the start of the 1920s. Fontayne expressed an early fondness for detailed drawing, particularly evident in his still lifes. The artist simply and directly arranges the elements against a uniform background. The same economy of means is also seen in his early landscapes, which suggest a figurative Cubism like that taught by Andr√© Lothe in the academy he founded in 1921 in the Rue d‚ÄôOdessa.  Paris and Brittany  The year 1929 marks a turning point in Fontayne's career. At his initial appearance at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, his decorative compositions sparked interest from the Galerie Simonson in Paris, which offered the artist his first solo show in April of the same year. For his Paris debut, Fontayne immediately demonstrated his fondness for landscape. His search for subjects led him to the basilica at V√©zelay and to the Limousin for views of Uzerche and Crozant, as Armand Guillaumin had done before him. Along the V√©z√®re, flowing through the Corr√®ze and P√©rigord, Fontayne captured the reflections of the houses in the water, the subject of one painting acquired by the French government in 1928 at the 19th Exposition de l‚Äô√âclectique. Between 1931 and 1933 Fontayne, now in great demand, took part in a range of group shows in Paris.13 The exhibition ‚ÄòArtistes Protestants Modernes‚Äô, which featured, along with Fontayne, such renowned artists as Raoul Dufy, G√©rard Sandoz, Jacques- √âmile Ruhlmann, Jean Dunand, Le Corbusier and Jean Jeanneret, questioned the identity of a specifically French Protestant art. The restraint of Fontayne's compositions clearly resonated with this philosophy, like the rigour that pervades the lines of the Art Deco furniture and modernist architecture.  Fontayne and the Art Deco style  His several watercolours reveal a sensitive study of light, for example those of the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris, where he sketched the park's regular visitors and, with sharp observation of nature, produced some tree studies. An easel painter, Fontayne was also a recognised interior designer, fully involved in the Art Deco movement launched at Paris's Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs of 1925. His first essays in this style were large decorative panels, similar to that exhibited at the 1932 Salon des Ind√©pendants. An easel painter, Fontayne was also a recognised interior designer, fully involved in the Art Deco movement launched at Paris's Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs of 1925. His first essays in this style were large decorative panels, similar to that exhibited at the 1932 Salon des Ind√©pendants. He also composed a number of other similar decorative panels such as he showed at the 22nd Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes D√©corateurs of Paris (Paris, Grand Palais). The 1932 Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes D√©corateurs saw the creation of the Study Committee to organise the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques. Fontayne won the competition to design the d√©cor of the National Pavilion for ‚ÄòMobilier et des Ensembles Mobiliers‚Äô (Furniture and Furniture Sets)‚Äô. For this prestigious location, the French government commissioned Fontayne to produce a vast ceiling, no longer extant, like most of the design features created for this event. In section 38 of the show, Fontayne exhibited, on the stand of the Barb√®s Gallery, which represented the artist, the complete d√©cor of a Salon-Boudoir in a harmonious pale-green hue. This set is made up of rosewood furniture, wall lamps and two decorative paintings. Here Fontayne acts as a professional interior designer, just like a Jacques- √âmile Ruhlmann, with whom he had exhibited six years earlier.  Fontayne's teaching  Fontayne‚Äôs varied gifts and accomplishments as painter and designer naturally led him to teaching. In 1931 he was appointed professor of decorative compositions at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Arts et Industries Textiles de Roubaix. A dedicated teacher who took his mission seriously, Fontayne had his students participate in the different decorative projects under his direction. This is how, starting in 1931, a small group formed around him that was responsible for the decorative scheme of the main staircase designed for the new town hall of Vincennes. The building was inaugurated in 1935. Five years later, he had his students at the √âcole des Arts Appliqu√©s de Paris create the sets and costumes for \\"Mon oncle Benjamin\\", a musical comedy by Francis Bousquet. Fontayne had been appointed to the post of professor of manufactured fabrics at the school in 1940. In the 1940s Fontayne preferred to exhibit regularly at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, rather than at the other Parisian salons. Remaining faithful to his Vieilles maisons in the P√©rigord and Aveyron, the painter continued to show Languedoc landscapes and paintings of flowers until 1950. Less productive as the years passed ‚Äì he rarely exhibited more than two works per salon after 1940 ‚Äì in 1942 Fontayne answered the call of the landscape painter Andr√© Dauchez, who invited him to take part in the first ever National Ind√©pendant show, a salon that broke with the official shows.  Main exhibitions  In 1942 the Galerie Bailly and later, in 1946, the Galerie Allard made themselves available to Fontayne. In 1943, the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne de la Ville de Paris invited the artist to take part in a group show. Due final homage was paid to Fontayne during his lifetime, this time from his profession, with a solo show at the Maison des Artistes, in October 1947. Ren√© Fontayne died five years later, on 17 September 1952, in the modest village of his birth, Verg√®ze, from which he drew the noble simplicity of his art. Two years later the Galerie Van Ryck in Paris devoted a retrospective to his landscapes painted in southern France that featured forty-five canvases, inspired by his travels in the Gard, Aude, Aveyron and Tarn.

The log drives, which resulted in 16-foot logs lying along the waterfront, ended in 1982. By the 1870s, Britannia Village was a summer resort for people who lived in Ottawa, Ontario. In the 1870s, rails were laid towards the capital, linking the waterfront of Britannia Township, Woodroffe and Westboro. By 1871, Britannia Township consisted of a flag station of the Canadian Central Railway (CCRR), farmland, a few houses, shops, a mill and a Methodist church. Britannia Aquatic Club The Britannia Aquatic Club (BAC) was founded circa 1887 using a converted sawmill, cottages and boat storage built by John Cameron Jamieson, a lumberman, baker, and alderman as its headquarters. Britannia Nautical Club In 1892, the Britannia Aquatic Club (BAC) changed its name to the Britannia Nautical Club (BNC), still using a converted Mill built in 1880‚Äì85 by John Cameron Jamieson as its headquarters. On August 29, 1891, the BNC held its first regatta which included sailing, paddling and rowing races. The mandate of the Club was to foster all kinds of water sports, and to hold regattas, sailing races, canoe, rowing and log rolling events. Britannia Bay Boat House Club In 1895 the Britannia Boat House Club was granted an Act of Incorporation by Judge Ross. The board of directors consisted of Thomas H Kirby, C Jackson Booth, E.L.

The Edward Miall award for Junior Members who show improvement in their ability was founded in memory of three brothers, Alexander (22), Walter (19) and Eddy (16) Brothy and Peter Winfield (10), who drowned on July 26, 1895. Edward Miall, whose son Ray was rescued three hours later still clinging to his father's capsized skiff, sought to stress all-round proficiency in hope of presenting such tragedy in future. The B.Y.C. Photographic Archives' six oldest known pictures show a group of people sailing towing a bun, man in a cockpit, regatta etc. c. 1895 by Charter member, E. L. Brittain. After the club outgrew the old mill building, the present club house designed by Edgar Lewis Horwood was opened in 1896 on the present site, on a leased property owned by lumber baron J.R. Booth, closer to the Desch√™nes Rapids.

In 1899, the Ottawa Electric Railway Company privately financed and built a double street-car Britannia line from Holland Avenue, which was in operation from 1900‚Äì1959 with off-peak service of 5 cars per hour to Britannia. Since the street-car operated on Sundays, its recreational developments at Britannia were profitable. Large numbers of people took the Britannia-on-the Bay street-car each summer from 1900 to the Second World War to a combined waterfront amusement park, summer resort and commuter village. In 1899, the Metropolitan Power Company was formed to construct a power house just north of the Britannia Boathouse Club with a 2000-foot canal to extend to the lower end of the Deschenes Rapids. Although the hydroelectric project was abandoned as unfeasible, the unfinished canal was used in 1951 by Past Commodores Thomas G. Fuller and Reginald G. Bruce with labour provided by volunteer Club members as the basis of the BYC protected harbour. Today, the BYC harbour provides 250 wet moorings, fuel and pump out facilities, for both sail and power boats. In the late 1800s upon the death of the a Charter member and custodian of the club records, E. Stockton, the administrators of his affairs sent the documents to the Township dump.

The crowd of thousands enjoyed musical entertainment in the auditorium, dancing to the Tippins' orchestra in the club house, band concerts in the parks and a spirit of carnival. The ladies made costumes for the minstrel show at the carnival as well as an earlier show held at the Russell Theatre earlier in the season. Invitations were sent to convalescent soldiers at the Fleming home, who attended as guests of the club. This was the first carnival of its kind held in any Canadian city.

The original version of the song is featured on Super Cat's album Don Dada (1992). The song was a major success for Super Cat, reaching number 64 on the R&B; singles chart and number 21 on both the rap and dance charts. Background The original version of the song appears on Super Cat's album Don Dada, written and produced by fellow reggae artist Trevor Sparks, who provides a chorus as well as backing vocals and ad-libs to the song. Remix versions The song's original version appears on Super Cat's album Don Dada, where Trevor Sparks, who co-wrote the song, also performs its chorus and backing vocals. There are two official remix versions to the song. The first remix version, entitled \\"Dolly My Baby (Hip Hop Mix)\\", features backing vocals by Mary J. Blige, and contains a sample of Herbie Hancock's \\"Watermelon Man\\" and Mountain's \\"Long Red\\". Mary J. Blige (pictured) performed backing vocals for the remix version. The second remix version, titled \\"Dolly My Baby (Bad Boy Extended Mix)\\", is the same as the first remix version, only this time with guest vocals by co-remix producers Jesse West (under the alias 3rd Eye) and Sean Combs (under the alias as Puff Daddy). In addition to Combs and West, the remix also marked the official recording debut of a then-unknown The Notorious B.I.G. (who was also known as \\"B.I.G.\\" and \\"Biggie Smalls\\"). 3rd Eye's verse contained an interpolation of the traditional folk song \\"Ring a Ring of O' Roses\\" and in the \\"Bad Boy Extended Mix\\" version, he opens his verse with \\"bling bling. Who's that with Super Cat?\\". It has since been suggested that 3rd Eye was the first hip-hop artist to coin the complete term \\"bling bling.\\" The original version contains a sample and an interpolation of Eric Donaldson's \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\", and B.I.G.'s verse included a sample of \\"Maddy Maddy Cry\\" by Papa San. This version is well known today.

Career Schoyer studied at Yale College, where he wrote and illustrated for campus humor magazine The Yale Record.The Yale Record. New Haven: Yale Record. January 1, 1932. The Residential College he was affiliated with was Pierson. After graduation in 1933, Schoyer taught English in Changsha, Hunan, for what was then the Yale-in-China Association, and returned to Yale to study Oriental literature and Chinese language. His return to China was cut short by the impending war. In 1940, he made a dramatic escape from Changsha. After the city had been bombed eight times, he led a group of twenty doctors, nurses, and wounded by junk to escape on the Xiang River after dark, only to be discovered and attacked on the river in the morning by a Japanese fighter plane. He managed to get the party out through Indo-China in six weeks. When the United States entered the war, he became a major in Air Intelligence, and created the Air Ground Aid Section (AGAS), which instructed airmen in how to evade or escape if downed behind enemy lines. He worked with Chinese guerrillas on several rescue operations. At the end of the war, he headed a mission to Shanghai to liberate seven thousand Allied prisoners being held in Japanese camps.Robin W. Winks, Cloak & Gown: Scholars in the Secret War, 1939‚Äì1961 (New York: Morrow, 1987), p. 46 For this work, Schoyer won the Legion of Merit and Soldier's Medal.\\"Flint In the summer of 1941, Schoyer dated author Margaret Wise Brown.Marcus, 147 ‚Äì 148. As representative of Yale- in-China in Hong Kong in the early 1950s, he conducted negotiations between New Asia College and the government of the colony in establishing the college as an officially recognized school. From 1959 till July 1964, he was the Comptroller and Yale-in-China representative for New Asia. He was also the President of the Universities Service Centre in Hong Kong and Special Assistant to the Vice-Chancellor of the University.The University Bulletin (Chinese University of Hong Kong) 1.5 (November 1964) p. 6 Schoyer was on the first delegation to the People's Republic organized by the National Committee on U. S.- China Relations in December 1972, participating in Nixon's Ping Pong Diplomacy effort. In 1978, several years after having returned to Yale-in- China as Executive Director, he became seriously ill and in March died of lung cancer. Literary works Schoyer wrote four novels with Chinese backgrounds: The Foreigners (1942), The Indefinite River (1947), The Ringing of the Glass (1950), and The Typhoon's Eye (1959). The Foreigners concerns a group of white expatriates living in a city very much like Changsha. Schoyer told Edward Gulick, who had taught in Changsha with him, that the hero of The Foreigners, Peter Achilles, was a combination of himself and Gulick (an earlier Yale-in- China Bachelor, who served from 1913‚Äì1914, was named Paul Achilles). Achilles tells a friend: \\"I came out here for a year, just to see the world before I settled down; but I've stayed two and now I'm staying for another. And after that, perhaps I'll stay forever. China's fatal, isn't it? It's like a drug.\\" \\"More than that,\\" his friend replies, \\"It changes people.

Background John II was married to the Hungarian princess Piroska, and this involved him in the dynastic struggles of the Kingdom of Hungary. In giving asylum to √Ålmos, a blinded claimant to the Hungarian throne, John aroused the suspicions of King Stephen II of Hungary. John refused a demand from Stephen that √Ålmos be surrendered to him. The Hungarians, led by the king, then crossed the Danube frontier and invaded Byzantium's Balkan provinces. Most authorities place this event in 1127, with hostilities lasting until 1129; however, an alternative chronology has been suggested with the Hungarian attack and Byzantine retaliation taking place in 1125 with a renewal of hostilities in 1126.Note: Byzantine primary sources, Cinnamus and Choniates, give little detail about this campaign; no dates are specified, and what they do say differs considerably. The chronology presented here, 1127‚Äì1129, follows that of Michael Angold and other scholars, but John Fine has the events taking place earlier in 1125‚Äì1126.; . The Hungarians attacked Belgrade, Ni≈°, and Sofia; John, who was near Philippopolis in Thrace, counterattacked, supported by a naval flotilla operating on the River Danube.; . Battle Seal of Stephen II of Hungary (r. 1116‚Äì1131). After a challenging campaign, the details of which are obscure, John II managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or Chramon, located in modern Nova Palanka, on the Hungarian bank of the Danube. The Hungarian army, under a commander named Setephel as King Stephen was ill, had entrenched itself, defending the line of the Danube.. The Hungarian Chronicle indicates that the Byzantines gained naval control of the river; it says that the 'Greeks' had set the Hungarian ships \\"alight with sulphurous fires\\", indicating the use of the incendiary weapon, 'Greek fire'.Lau, p. 123 The Byzantine historian John Cinnamus describes John II employing a ruse to allow his army to cross the river.. He sent a mercenary force composed of \\"Ligurian knights\\" (Lombards) and Turks (probably horse archers) to threaten a crossing upstream, while he stayed on the shore opposite Haram with the rest of his army. The ruse worked as his army crossed the river at Haram by boat, the emperor himself on board the imperial trireme. An opposed river crossing is one of the most demanding of military operations. The Byzantine army must have been very disciplined and well supported by archers and bolt-firing artillery on the imperial ships.. Once on the Hungarian bank of the Danube the Byzantine cavalry then, \\"with couched lances, scattered the assembled Hungarian forces.\\". Many Hungarian troops were killed when a bridge they were crossing collapsed as they were fleeing from the Byzantine attack. The Byzantines took Haram, and other Hungarian fortified settlements in the area, and collected a great deal of plunder. The action has been described as a \\"bloody battle\\" and a great defeat for the Hungarians.. The Hungarian Chronicle says of the battle: \\"The hand of God was with the Greeks and the Hungarians could not resist them. The slaughter that took place was so great that its like has rarely been seen. The river Karas was so infused with human blood that it appeared to flow with gore alone. The warriors began to throw corpses into the river and fled across them, crossing the river as if by a bridge. However, more Hungarians were slaughtered like cattle, for nothing could save them from the Greeks\\".Stephenson, p. 209 Aftermath Following his victory over the Hungarians John II launched a punitive raid against the Serbs. Dangerously for the Byzantines the Serbs had aligned themselves with Hungary. Many Serbian prisoners were taken, and these were transported to Nicomedia in Asia Minor to serve as military colonists. This was done partly to cow the Serbs into submission (Serbia was, at least nominally, a Byzantine protectorate), and partly to strengthen the Byzantine frontier in the east against the Turks. The Serbs were forced to acknowledge Byzantine suzerainty once again.. In Hungary, the defeat at Haram undermined Stephen II's authority and he faced a serious revolt when two counts, named 'Bors' (possibly Boris Kalamanos) and 'Ivan', were declared kings. Both were eventually defeated, Ivan being beheaded and Bors fleeing to Byzantium.. Following this, the Hungarians renewed hostilities, possibly in order that King Stephen could be seen to reassert his authority, by attacking the Byzantine frontier fortress of Braniƒçevo, which was immediately rebuilt by John. Further Byzantine military successes ‚Äì Choniates mentions several engagements ‚Äì resulted in a restoration of peace. Cinnamus describes a Byzantine reverse occurring before peace was established, which suggests that the campaign was not entirely one-sided.. Hungarian records, however, agree with Choniates in indicating that King Stephen was again defeated and was consequently forced to negotiate a peace on Byzantine terms.. The Byzantines were confirmed in their control of Braniƒçevo, Belgrade, and Zemun and they also recovered the region of Sirmium (called Frangochorion in Choniates), which had been Hungarian since the 1060s. The Hungarian pretender √Ålmos died in 1129, removing the major source of friction.. See also *Komnenian Byzantine army ReferencesSources=Primary Secondary  *Lau, M.C.G.

To promote the song, Hesketh released a series of clips from the music video in which several people enter a booth and put on a pair of headphones while looking through a pane of glass. It was first released for sale on 3 June 2012 digitally by Elektra Records. \\"Headphones\\" was originally intended to be included in Little Boots' second studio album Nocturnes (2013), but was later cut out from the final track listing. Critical reception Popjustice's critics stated that they enjoyed the song, but were confused by Hesketh's releases and promotion. They compared her earlier career to Kylie Minogue when promoting her debut Hands, but stated that she is acting more like Hot Chip with her releases this time around. Music video The music video for \\"Headphones\\" was directed by Bullion Collective, and premiered on 6 June 2012, on Little Boots's YouTube channel. Hesketh described the content of the video as people going to a peep show booth, but they wear headphones and listen to music: \\"The idea is that everyday characters enter a booth and on listening to the song their extrovert selves appear in the reflection, so the song is a way of releasing their inner selves and setting the crazier side of them free... We wanted to create an energetic party atmosphere to fit the song whilst avoiding the cliches of a lot of current club themed videos.\\" She was inspired in part by the film Paris, Texas.

The hotel occupies the greater part of a block bounded by Colmore Row, Church Street, Barwick Street and Livery Street and overlooks St Philip's Cathedral and churchyard. Designed by architect Thomson Plevins, construction began in 1875 and the hotel opened in 1879. Extensions and extensive interior renovations were undertaken by prominent Birmingham architecture firm Martin & Chamberlain from 1890 to 1895. Interior renovations included the building of the Grosvenor Room with Louis XIV style decoration. The hotel closed in 2002 and due to the risk of crumbling stonework it has been under scaffolding and protective covers since. In 2012 planning permission was granted for plans to restore the building into a luxury hotel. Works to the exterior began in October 2012 and it is planned to open the building as a hotel in 2020. In January 2020 it was announced the hotel would open in summer 2020, with 185 bedrooms, two new bars and a restaurant, a gymnasium, meeting rooms, collaboration areas, and event spaces. History Before the 1870s, St Philip's churchyard was surrounded with Georgian terraces. However, as a result of the Second Birmingham Improvement Act of 1861, the buildings were to be cleared for the redevelopment of Colmore Row. As the leases on the buildings on Colmore Row began to end in the late 1860s, demolition began. Barwick Street was constructed in 1870 and several plots of land bounded by Colmore Row, Church Street, Barwick Street and Livery Street were acquired to create the site of the hotel. Isaac Horton, a major Birmingham land and property owner and his architect and builder, Thomson Plevins, were very active in the acquisition of the land and developing it in line with the 1861 Act. Plevins issued three separate contracts for the Colmore Row range of the hotel and construction work started in 1875 on the corner of Church Street. The hotel opened on 1 February 1879, with 100 rooms and a further 60 unfinished at the time of opening. Other facilities included a restaurant with an entrance fronting Church Street, two coffee rooms and stock rooms. The stock rooms were an exhibition space where businessmen could demonstrate their new products and were built as the hotel aimed to attract most of its clients from commercial visitors from out of town. The hotel was let to Arthur Field, a hotel operator from Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1880 the hotel was extended, when the corner of Church Street and Barwick Street was built. Colmore Row in 1870, before the hotel was builtIn 1890, the hotel operator fell into financial difficulties, and the hotel was handed back to the owners Hortons' Estate Ltd. The owners then decided to revamp the hotel to appeal more to the luxury market. From 1890‚Äì91, the majority of the interior of the hotel was reconstructed, decorated and furnished at a cost of ¬£40,000 by Martin and Chamberlain. In 1893‚Äì95, extensive additions were made with the construction of a new block fronting Barwick Street. Within this new block was the Grosvenor Room, the Grosvenor Drawing Room, and the Crush Room, all decorated in rich and impressive Louis XIV style decoration. The building contractors were Barnsley and Son of Ryland St. North, and the building was furnished by Norton and Co. of Corporation Street. 75 new bedrooms were built in the new block, and two highly decorated billiards rooms were added to the basement. The stock rooms remained as they were an essential part of the commercial accent of the hotel. The hotel's heyday was in the early 20th century, when it played host to royalty, politicians and film stars as well as staging many dinners, concerts and dances in the Grosvenor Suites. King George VI, Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, Charlie Chaplin, James Cagney and Joe Louis attended functions or stayed in the hotel at this time. Despite its previous success, as the century continued, the hotel ran into financial difficulties and closed in 1969. Hickmet Hotels took lease of the hotel in 1972, and even after a ¬£500,000 refurbishment, trading conditions proved difficult, and they fell into receivership in 1976. Grand Metropolitan Hotels took over the lease in 1977 and undertook a ¬£1.5 million refurbishment. In 1978, architects Harper Sperring undertook a modernisation of the interior and the exterior of the hotel. A major repair job was undertaken on the exterior stonework on Colmore Row and Church Street which comprised applying a resin sealant coat, followed by a thick cement layer and then over painting. In 1982 the lease was passed to Queens' Moat Hotels; with little investment and maintenance during the 1980s and 1990s, the hotel again fell into decline. In August 2002, the hotel closed due to financial difficulties. The exterior of the building began to deteriorate because of poor quality stonework; scaffolding was erected for public safety. In 2003, plans were put forward by the owners to demolish the building as the maintenance costs were becoming too high. The Victorian Society countered these plans by putting forward an application to spot-list the building to save it from demolition. In May 2004, the building was designated with a Grade II* listing protecting it from demolition. In 2012, a planning application was put forward and accepted to restore the hotel. Owners Hortons' Estate proposed a ¬£30 million scheme to the restore the hotel's fa√ßade, the Grosvenor Suites, and the grand staircase, and to re-model the inside to create a 152-bedroom, 8-suite, luxury hotel and move the main entrance to Church Street. Works to the exterior began in October 2012. Architecture The Grosvenor Room c.1920 The Grand Hotel is one of the largest Victorian buildings in central Birmingham and forms part of the informal square around St Philip's Cathedral. The materials used on the north side of Colmore Row are predominantly stone with some brick and terracotta. The Colmore Estate insisted on the use of stone to add status, grandeur and dignity to the north side of Colmore Row. It has been stated that the north side of Colmore Row presents the best ensemble of Mid-Victorian palazzo splendour in Birmingham. The building, by Thomson Plevins, is principally of French Renaissance style, a style first used on a large hotel at the Great Western Hotel, Paddington by Philip Hardwick in 1851. The Colmore Row frontage is of 22 bays and symmetrical and built from ashlar and brick with stone dressings and hipped slate roofs with lead dressings. The Church Street fa√ßade is of 7 bays and decoratively similar to the Colmore Row front. The interior was redesigned by Martin & Chamberlain in 1890‚Äì91, and in 1893‚Äì95 the firm built an eight-storey red brick and terracotta block fronting onto Barwick Street. Within this block an elaborately decorated ballroom was built, named the Grosvenor Room. It is long and high. The decoration includes ornate plasterwork, giant corinthian pilasters and elegant cartouches. The large elaborate art-deco light fittings date from the 1920s. The double height ballroom was made possible with the innovative use of structural steelwork, possibly the first of its kind in Great Britain, as the use of steel in construction was still in its infancy at the time. The description of the Grosvenor Room in William Martin's obituary in the Birmingham Post states that: During the restoration in 2014, a course of red sandstone blocks was discovered on the Colmore Row and Church Street fa√ßades above the windows across the first four floors. The building is predominantly painted limestone and the specification of works required re-painting of all stonework. However the aesthetic impact of the red sandstone courses was deemed positive enough to be left exposed. Renovation After the hotel closed in August 2002, the building fell into disrepair and the poor quality stonework on the building's fa√ßade began to crumble. After some of the stonework fell onto the pavement in Colmore Row, the building was surrounded with scaffolding and protective covers to protect the public. Escalating maintenance costs led to the proposal by the owners to demolish the building in 2003. The proposal was dropped when the building was listed as a Grade II* listed building in 2004. The building then continued to lay vacant (except for the shops fronting Colmore Row) as the cost of repairing and restoring the building was deemed as too high or not even feasible due to the poor state of the exterior stonework. Under renovation in November 2012 In the summer of 2011, Arup Fa√ßade Engineering and Linford Group were appointed by Hortons' Estate at a cost of ¬£1.5 million to find a solution to restore the fa√ßade. It was discovered that some of the stone was unsuitable for construction in the first place and was laid incorrectly. The restoration team formed a repair strategy and worked on a trial area on Church Street. The strategy comprised stripping all paint and render back to solid stone, replacing all failed stone and repainting with modern paint that allows water vapour to permeate through it. After the successful trial, ¬£30 million proposals were drawn up and went on public consultation in January 2012 followed by a planning application in February 2012. The application outlined plans to transform the building into a 152-bedroom luxury hotel. The restoration would comprise remodeling the original 230 rooms into 152 air conditioned rooms, 8 new suites, with two new roof terraces in previously unused roof space, and nine new meeting rooms in the former stock rooms. Other elements include the creation of a terrace in the central courtyard, a hotel bar and restaurant accessed from Colmore Row, a standalone bar on the corner of Church Street and Barwick Street, a new main entrance on Church Street, and refurbished shops on Colmore Row based on a harmonised design and colour scheme. The stonework fa√ßades on Colmore Row and Church Street, the Grosvenor Suites and the grand staircase will be restored. The project team for the project is Hortons' Estate Ltd and architect Berman Guedes Stretton. On 26 April 2012, the planning application received unanimous backing from city councillors. The project began in October 2012 with a projected finishing date of summer 2014. The contract for the restoration of the fa√ßade was awarded to Midland Conservation Limited with the works expected to take 18 months. Restoration of the fa√ßade had an original budget of ¬£3.5 million with 6% of the cost coming from a grant from English Heritage. However, due to problems during the tendering process for the interior building contract, no interior works were started. In October 2014 it was reported that an extra ¬£4 million will be invested by the owners with ¬£2.5 million spent on further facade refurbishment and a new roof and ¬£1.5 million spent on refurbishing 10 shops fronting Colmore Row and 10,000 sq ft of office space within the building. A deal on the interior works with building contractors and a hotel operator was yet to be agreed. The project was awarded a ¬£6 million grant in November 2015 from Birmingham City Council and the GBSLEP, of which ¬£4 million will be repayable subject to commercial success of the hotel. The grant made the aspiration to return the building to hotel use financially viable with the owners reporting that talks were taking place with two hotel operators. In January 2020, it was announced by Starwood Capital Group that the hotel would open in summer 2020, following an extensive ¬£45 million refurbishment. The restoration includes new penthouse suites, a sunken rooftop garden terrace, two new bars and a restaurant, a gymnasium, meeting rooms, collaboration areas, and event spaces. In media During January 2012 the BBC drama Dancing on the Edge written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff used the Grosvenor Room as the filming location for the Imperial Ballroom. The Imperial Ballroom was used for a scene in Episode 4 of The Game in 2014. The hotel features in Kit de Waal's novel The Trick to Time.

It is on this land that Linton Hall School (formerly Linton Hall Military School) was established. Linton's Ford Linton's Ford was part of the land owned by a family of English \\"Cavaliers\\" (followers of King Charles I of England) who came to Virginia from Scotland just after the English Civil War and settled in Prince William County, Virginia. The family had land holdings in Dumfries as well as Bristow.The Linton's Living Legacy, John T. Toler, Haymarket Lifestyle Magazine, June 2012 The property was originally around 740 acres and was owned by Moses Linton, great-great- grandson of Sir Walter de Lynton, who never lived on the property, instead building his home on his property at Marumsco Creek. Upon his death, the land was transferred to his son, John Augustine Elliott Linton (1762‚Äì1822), who built the Linton mansion and purchased approximately one thousand additional acres. J.A.E. Linton was sheriff of Prince William County and Justice of the Peace. He married Sarah Tyler, with whom he had a son, John Tyler Linton (1796‚Äì1821). John Tyler Linton held a law degree from Dickinson College. John T.Linton married Cecilia Ann Graham, the daughter of a prominent family in Dumfries. The two took up residence at Linton's Ford, where John Tyler died of typhoid fever when he was 26 years old, just two months before the birth of his daughter, Sarah Elliott Graham Linton (1822‚Äì1901). Cecilia then married the overseer of her estate, R.H. Phillips, and the couple had a daughter, Anne Cecilia Phillips (1823‚Äì1917). Less than a year later, Cecilia was widowed again and Anne's uncle, Campbell Graham was appointed their guardian. Sarah Linton was sent to the Georgetown Academy for Young Ladies in Washington D.C. (which has since been renamed Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School) to be given an education \\"befitting her rank.\\" Sarah converted to Catholicism and later became a nun, taking the name Sister Baptista, Order of Visitation. As the last heir of Linton's Ford, Sister Baptista needed to find a way to dispose of her property while making provisions for her younger sister. Over the years, a portion of the land had been sold in order to support her sister, Anne, while another part of the plantation had been acquired by the Southern Railroad as a right of way. After reading \\"The Monks of the West\\" by Count de Montalembert, Sister Baptista decided to give the Benedictine Monks of Belmont Abbey, NC the remaining land. Her sister's future was secured by a relative who promised her an annual annuity of $1,500.Cadet, Linton Hall, Linton Hall Military School Memories: One cadet's memoir, Scrounge Press, 2014. The Benedictine Fathers established St. Maurus Boys‚Äô School in the donated land in 1893; the Benedictine Sisters established St. Edith's Academy for girls in 1894. St. Edith's opened with sixteen boarders and several day students.The Fruit of His Works, Sister Helen Johnson, O.S.B., Bristow, Va.: Linton Hall Press, 1954. In the early 1920s, the enrollment of both schools began to decline. The Benedictine Fathers closed St. Maurus Boys' School and returned to their abbey in Belmont, North Carolina. In 1922, the Benedictine Sisters founded St. Gertrude High School for girls in Richmond, Virginia. The same year, St. Edith's, in Bristow, was converted to Linton Hall Military School, a military boarding school for boys ages 6‚Äì16. In 1946, the first floor of the main portion of the present building was completed. By 1951, the second and third floors and the classroom wing were completed, and the gymnasium was built in 1956. By 1978, the school had been renamed Linton Hall School but it was not until the late 1980s that the school dropped the military program and became coeducational.

They are about tall and large each. They were painted for the United Nations Headquarters as a gift from the Brazilian government. Viewing Candido Portinari‚Äôs War and Peace assists in the understanding of war, regardless of the time period. It does not feature any weapons, but instead features the suffering of victims from war, which illustrates the barbarity of combat. The contrast between the elements of chaos and harmony show the importance of maintaining peace and the attempts to end violent conflicts. Though painted in the 1950s, they were, and still are a representation of the worldwide struggle for peace. The whole set of paintings work together as a representation of the atrocity of war and the importance of peace in the world. War and Peace were re-inaugurated in the United Nations Headquarters on September 8, 2015. The murals were celebrated by several guests, among whom were several heads of states, iconic artists, and the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. During this event people shared a moment of silence in order to honour Portinari and his contributions. Overall, the murals were acknowledged as a symbol of obtaining and working towards worldwide peace. Portinari reportedly sacrificed his own health for the murals, as during the long term process of creating the artworks Portinari became increasingly sick because of the paint he used. Doctors had warned him about being intoxicated due to inhalation, which would cause a decline in his health. Despite this, Portinari was dedicated to finishing his masterpieces, through which he hoped to send an important message to the world. He was able to complete the timeless murals, though, this cost him his health: he died on February 6, 1962 due to lead intoxication. Portinari was banned from entering the US to inaugurate the panels, due his participation in the Communist Party. Nevertheless, Portinari remains eternal through his numerous paintings, including the murals of War and Peace. As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated during the re- installation, \\"Portinari is no longer alive, but his legacy will live forever at the United Nations. Let us realize his vision and move from war to peace.\\" Physical History Once the completed set of paintings were received in 1956 by the UN headquarters in New York City, they were placed behind glass frames in order to help prevent damage from the public. However, the panels were still exposed to sunlight, and during the intervening 54 years, that exposure took its toll on the masterpieces. In 2010, the UN sent the works to Rio de Janeiro for restoration. After going through a long restoration process, the paintings were displayed to the public in Brazil and France, before being sent back to New York in December 2014. The murals remained covered until the re- inauguration on September 8, 2015. During the re-inauguration Ban Ki-moon also stated, \\"War and Peace are more than magnificent works of art. They are Portinari‚Äôs call to action. Thanks to him, all leaders who enter the United Nations see the terrible toll of war and the universal dream for peace.\\" See also * United Nations Art Collection ReferencesExternal links * An exhibition of the work  Sources: un.org, g1.globo.com, epoca.globo.com 1950s paintings War paintings Diplomatic gifts Headquarters of the United Nations United Nations art collection Candido Portinari ","title":"War and Peace (Portinari)"},{"id":"36061151","text":"Ridha Saidi Ridha Saidi (born 1962) is a Tunisian politician.

Deep Diver was the first small submersible designed for lockout diving, allowing divers to leave and enter the craft while underwater. It was first launched in January 1966. Construction and design Deep Diver was initially known as the Perry-Link #4 and was built in Riviera Beach, Florida by the Perry Submarine Company. Its name was subsequently changed to Deep Diver and its ownership transferred to Link's company, Ocean Systems, Inc. The submersible contained two compartments: a divers' compartment, developed from Link's earlier work with his Submersible Decompression Chamber (SDC), which allowed divers to be compressed to the ambient pressure of the ocean and leave the submersible to work underwater, and a pilots' compartment which remained at surface pressure, allowing the pilot and an observer to make dives without undergoing decompression. The two compartments were connected by a hatch which could be sealed off. Deep Diver was the first modern diver lock-out submersible.Busby, pp. 55-56. Deep Diver was 22 feet long and 8.5 feet tall. It weighed 8.25 tons dry. It allowed one pilot and three observers to dive for a total of 32 man-hours to a depth limit of 1350 feet. Divers could lock-out through a botom hatch to a maximum depth of 1250 feet. Both the pilot' and divers' compartments were made of 0.5-in rolled and welded T1 steel, 54 inches tall. Deep Diver's main hatch was 23 inches in diameter. The submersible featured no manipulators. It had twenty- one acrylic plastic viewports. The ballast and trim tanks provided 845 pounds and 676 pounds of positive buoyancy, respectively, when emptied. A large battery pod containing four battery banks could be jettisoned in an emergency, providing an additional 1500 pounds of buoyancy. Undersea missions Deep Diver carried out many scientific missions in 1967 and 1968 operated from Link's underwater research vessel, Sea Diver. These included a 430-foot lockout dive in 1967 (at the same location as the 1964 Man in Sea dive by Robert St√©nuit and Jon Lindbergh) and a 700-foot lockout dive near Great Stirrup Cay in 1968. Dr. Joseph B. MacInnis participated in both of these dives as an observer in Deep Diver's forward chamber. In September 1967 Deep Diver carried out a classified Ocean Systems mission on the Grand Banks south of Newfoundland. A cable plow, rumored to be used for burying a strategic communications cable, had been lost in 400 feet of water. Two Navy divers had already been killed trying to recover it. A crew of four Ocean Systems personnel, including MacInnis, unsuccessfully attempted to recover the cable plow using the submersible. The mission was called off due to rising winds, and Deep Diver was barely brought safely back aboard the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS John Cabot.MacInnis, pp. 81-90. Decommissioning Later in 1968, after Deep Diver had been requisitioned by the United States Navy to help search for the lost submarine USS Scorpion, the Bureau of Ships determined that Deep Diver was unsafe for use at great depths or in extremely cold temperatures because of the substitution of the wrong kind of steel, which became brittle in cold water, in some parts of the sub. Link proceeded to design a new lockout sub with a distinctive acrylic bubble as the forward pilot/observer compartment. In January 1971 the new sub was launched and commissioned to the Smithsonian Institution. It was named the Johnson Sea Link after its donors, Link and his friend John Seward Johnson I. Deep Diver was decommissioned and donated to the Smithsonian Institution. It was placed on display at the Marine Sciences Center in Fort Pierce, Florida.

The pilot and two passengers were accommodated in an enclosed cabin with extensive glazing. The tail rotor was carried on the end of an open tail boom constructed of welded steel tube, giving a layout similar to that of a Bell 47. The undercarriage consisted of two skids. A single prototype of the SM-4 was completed; the helicopter was used to carry out ground tests, but it never flew as the WN-06S engine failed to receive clearance for flight operations, and the program was abandoned.\\"PZL-Swidnik History - Helicopter Design\\".

Foundation  Corvin Film Studio was purchased at an auction by the State-founded Filmipari Alap (Film Industry Fund). On December 19, 1928, Hunnia Film Factory was founded in Budapest. Prime Minister, Istv√°n Bethlen, was determined to consolidate the Hungarian film industry and restore its old prestige. Therefore, the film factory was equipped with the most modern, German technology. The rebuilt studio was handed over on April 28, 1931. The next day, the film K√©k B√°lv√°ny was shot, which became the first Hungarian sound film.  Golden age  By the early 1940s, Hungary had become the third largest producer country in Europe's film industry. This was mainly due to its largest film factory. By this time, Hunnia had become a small empire. It had 7 studios and 1,300 people continuously. From its foundation, some 20 million meters of film had been shot, and their average budget was 400,000 peng≈ë.  War  In the closing months of the Second World War Hungary's ruling Arrow Cross regime planned to dismantle the studio and move it westwards, but this plan was wrecked when the Soviet Red Army captured Budapest.Cunningham p.60 In the end, the Second World War did not spare the Hunnia, its studios were all bombed.  Resurrection  The war was not over, but the Budapest's leadership with Mayor J√°nos Csorba at the forefront had already begun to rebuild the main studio, which once again reached the top of European film production. On October 2, 1945, the European film began again in Hunnia's Korda Studio for the first time after the Second World War. The first film was the filming of S√°ndor Br√≥dy's play A tan√≠t√≥n≈ë. After that, however, very few films were made until nationalization. Of these, the film, made in 1947 and later a world success and directed by G√©za Radv√°nyi, is definitely worth mentioning Valahol Eur√≥p√°ban.  Nationalization  On August 18, 1948, Hunnia was nationalized. From then on, it continued to function as Mafilm. Films are still made here to this day, here, where Korda started his Budapest Corvin Film Factory in 1917.  Note  Hunnia Film Studio as above should not be confused with the earlier similarly named Hunnia Studio that operated for two years from 1911. Later, Hunnia studios were formed several times within the Mafilm, confusion with them should be avoided.

Aircraft designer In 1909 he joined the British & Colonial Aeroplane Company moving in 1914 to Vickers in London. At the start of the first world war he moved to the Royal Aircraft Factory. In July 1916 he was appointed the chief designer at S.E. Saunders Limited on the Isle of Wight. Thomas first design to fly was the Saunders T.1 a two-seat biplane, it first flew in 1917 but only one was built. His next project was a large flying boat bomber named Great Britain designed to carry a 1,000 lbs of bombs to Berlin. The design was not built possibly due to Thomas contracting influenza from which he died on 17 October 1918.

The targets were a group of off-duty civil guards who were having lunch in a bar in the town. Four civil guards were killed. The attack was one of the deadliest of 1980, the year when ETA killed more people than any other.Timeline: Eta campaign, BBC News, 8 September 2010 accessed 6 June 2012 Background The shootings were the first ETA attack since the Spanish government had survived a vote of confidence and the first since the Basque Nationalist Party had agreed to return to the Spanish parliament after a short dispute.Asesinados cuatro guardias civiles en un bar de Marquina (Vizcaya), El Pais, 21 September 1980 The civil guards who would be killed in the attack were responsible for guarding the Esperanza y Cia Arms factory. Seven months earlier, ETA had ambushed and killed six civil guards who had been guarding weapons in transit from the factory in an attack near Ispaster. Attack The bar normally served around 20 customers during lunchtimes and was popular with civil guards, as it was only 200 metres from their barracks in the town. The main entrance was normally closed at lunchtimes after the bar had filled, with a back entrance available for latecomers. At 14:40, only eight people were present in the bar, including two bar workers, two postal workers and the four civil guards, when a man aged around 25 entered the bar and had a drink before leaving. Shortly after, Laura Arrieta Larreate, the 15-year-old daughter of the bar owners, who had been clearing tables, answered a knock at the back door. Three men then entered the bar and, after proceeding quickly to the table where the civil guards were eating, produced machine guns and shot the civil guards in the head and throat. All of the guards were killed instantly. The men then escaped in a car, whose owner was later found bound and gagged near a hill in the town of Elg√≥ibar. His car had been hijacked at gunpoint by four men one hour before the attack.Cuatro guardias civiles asesinados en un atentado, La Vanguardia, 21 September 1980, p5 The subsequent forensics sweep of the bar, found numerous shell casings of parabellum ammunition, a type favoured by ETA according to the security forces. Arrests and convictions One of those accused of involvement in the attack was Jose Ram√≥n Foruria Zubialdea, alias \\"Foru,\\" who was accused of supplying information to the Eibar commando unit of ETA, including a plan of the bar.Prisi√≥n para el etarra Jos√© Ram√≥n Foruria por el asesinato de cuatro guardias civiles en Marquina, El Mundo, 26 September 2003 Foru had fled from Spain to Venezuela in 1982 after the arrest of a cousin who he feared might reveal his cooperation with ETA. He was then extradited to Spain in September 2003.Venezuela entrega a Espa√±a al presunto etarra Foruria Zubialdea, La Vanguardia, 24 September 2003 Foru admitted having supplied information to ETA but denied involvement in the Markina attack. Found guilty, he was sentenced to forty years in prison.Condenan a un etarra casi 25 a√±os despu√©s del atentado en el que murieron cuatro guardias civiles, El Mundo, 12 January 2005 However, he was released in August 2011 on grounds of ill health, suffering from bladder cancer. In 1984, Jaime Rementer√≠a Beotegui was found guilty of participation in the attack, fined 60 million pesetas, and sentenced to prison. Having been in prison since August 1983, he was released in January 2004.Todas las vidas rotas, Diario de Burgos, 31 January 2010 Fidel Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a, who lent his car to the perpetrators to travel to the area and housed them for several days, before and after the attack, received the same sentence.
