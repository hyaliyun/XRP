The castle's formation is close to that of a square, with a tower measuring 24 metres in height. The castle's construction began in 1352, in the reign of Bogusław V, whose reign began the alliance with the Hanseatic League. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the castle was used as a warehouse and a prison. Since 1930, the castle was turned into a museum. History View on the courtyard in the Castle of the Pomeranian Dukes The Castle of the Pomeranian Dukes was built during the second half of the fourteenth century, in 1352. It was constructed during the reign of Bogusław V and Elżbieta, the daughter of Casimir III the Great. Although this was only a secondary residence of the House of Pomerania, the castle was enlarged and modernised in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, becoming a worth royal residence. The town of Darłowo was given the title of The Royal City of Darłowo (Królewskie Miasto Darłowo, Polish) The greatest expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Eric of Pomerania, who rebuilt the castle to that of the design of his previous residence, Kronborg Castle. He had also modernised the castle's defensive fortifications, and built a second defence line, in the form of dikes around the castle. The following expansion of the castle was done under the reign of Duke Bogusław X. When a new wing was built. The next changes were done by Duke Barnim XI. After a great fire, which devastated the castle in 1624, the last Duke of the House of Pomerania, Bogusław XIV, had rebuilt the castle. However, he did not restore the castle to its original architectural style. The castle had lost many of its defences, and a chapel was built inside the Duke Hall. After the duke's death, his widow, Duchess Elżbieta, took over the castle, who lived with him until death.

He is considered to be the greatest Senegalese thinker and philosopher and one of the prominent figures of African philosophy. His fertile imagination, his quick wit and his metaphorical sayings are part of the universe of Wolof culture. During his lifetime he was particularly concerned about the injustice of damels, whom he viewed as tyrannical. In popular culture In Ousmane Sembène's film Guelwaar, the actor playing the role of Guelwaar recited one of Kocc Barma's proverbs in the film. In addressing the crowd celebrating the food aid they've been given by white people in the presence of the European delegation and the country's political elite, Guelwaar took to the stage voicing his repulsion and shame of what he had witnessed before his very eyes, and reminded the crowd of the values of true African dignity and honour. In expressing his repulsion of the African leaders begging European powers for aid, and the humiliation and indignity thereof, he said: ::\\"Our ancestor Kocc Barma said:\\" ::\\"If you want to kill a proud man, give him what he needs to live everyday. In the long run you've made him a serf.\\" Following that speech, the crowd refused to accept the food aid to the dismay of the country's political elite and the Western delegation on the stage.

They were a subsidiary part of the Allied attempt to recapture Narvik. When the Germans achieved victory in the Campaigns in Central Norway, they began advancing north through Nordland to relieve the German forces isolated in Narvik. To prevent the Germans either relieving Narvik or capturing airfields within easy range, some small British and French units were deployed to the southern part of Nordland county early in May. A more powerful force (mainly British, but with some local Norwegian units) was detached from the expeditionary force besieging Narvik to northern and central Nordland in the middle of May. This force's arrival was disrupted by German air attacks on the ships carrying its units. German mountain troops forced the Allies back to within a few miles of their base at Bodø. The Allies had already decided to evacuate Norway at this point, and the force at Bodø was withdrawn without incident, with the last units departing by 1 June 1940. Background Nordland within Norway When the Germans launched Operation Weserübung, an invasion of Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940, one of their principal objectives was the port of Narvik in Northern Norway, through which iron ore was exported to Germany during the winter months. Part of the German 3rd Mountain Division commanded by Generalleutnant Eduard Dietl occupied the port, but were isolated when the destroyers and ships which had transported them and much of their supplies were destroyed in the First and Second naval battles of Narvik. The recovery of Narvik became one of the principal Allied objectives. Partly because of disagreements between the naval commander (Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork) and the designated land commander (Major General Pierse Joseph Mackesy), the Allies did not make a direct frontal assault on Narvik. Instead, they established a base at Harstad on Hinnøya Island on 14 April, and began encircling the German position. Between 14 April and 2 May, Allied forces which had landed at Åndalsnes and Namsos in Central Norway were forced to evacuate. The Norwegian forces in Central Norway either capitulated or were disbanded by 5 May and the Germans were free to advance north to relieve Dietl's force. Allied decisions As the force at Namsos was evacuated, Lieutenant General Hugh Massy, the commander of the British forces in Central Norway, recommended that a detachment of French ski troops defend Grong, to block the road and the uncompleted railway line running north from Namsos to Mosjøen. The commanders of the forces at Namsos objected, claiming that these routes were impassable even though Norwegian units had been moving easily between Grong and Mosjøen. However, the commanders at Narvik were anxious about the area around Bodø, where an airstrip was being constructed. They were concerned that even if German land forces did not link up with the Germans besieged at Narvik, the Allied position there could be made untenable if the Germans built or seized air bases within range. As early as 29 April, a company of 1st Battalion the Scots Guards was dispatched from Harstad to Bodø,Brown, p.104 while the French ski detachment and two British light anti- aircraft guns were transported by sea from Namsos to Mosjøen, arriving on 2 May aboard the transport Ulster Prince escorted by the destroyer HMS Veteran. When the Germans had attacked Norway, MI(R), a branch of the War Office in Britain which specialised in irregular warfare, had formed ten Independent Companies for raiding purposes, organised by Lieutenant Colonel Colin Gubbins. Even though official authorisation to form these units was issued only on 20 April, the first of them sailed for Norway on 27 April. On 2 May, Gubbins was ordered to form four of these companies into \\"Scissorsforce\\" and secure Bodø, Mo i Rana and Mosjøen.Wilkinson and Astley, p.50 This area of Norway was mountainous and sparsely populated. There was very little cover against air attack, nor could much use be made of night for cover given the long daylight hours in late spring and summer in the high latitudes. Mosjøen The Germans began advancing north from Grong on 5 May. To oppose them were a Norwegian battalion (numbering about 400), which was falling back to Mosjøen while carrying out ineffective demolitions, and another weak Norwegian reserve battalion. Nos. 4 and 5 Independent Companies landed at Mosjøen on the night of 8/9 May, replacing the small French detachment. No. 1 Independent Company meanwhile secured Mo i Rana and No. 3 Independent Company went to Bodø. On 9 May, the Germans drove the Norwegian defenders from Fellingfors, south of Mosjøen. No. 5 Independent Company and two Norwegian companies occupied a position from Mosjøen, where the road from the south ran between the Bjørnaa river and steep hillsides. Early in the morning of 10 May, the leading German troops (from the 181st Infantry Division)Adams (1989), p.73 advanced incautiously by bicycle up the road and were ambushed and destroyed by a platoon commanded by Captain John Prendergast, one of eight Indian Army officers attached to the Independent Companies, losing some fifty casualties.Wilkinson and Astley, p.52 Later in the morning, the German main body drove the British and Norwegians from this position, while Austrian ski troops outflanked the defenders. Gubbins, who was present, agreed with the Norwegian commander that there was no other suitable defensive position closer to Mosjøen. The two Independent Companies and the British light anti-aircraft detachment (which had to abandon its anti-aircraft guns) were evacuated in the early hours of 11 May aboard the Norwegian steamer Erling Jarl, which Gubbins had chartered for 5000 krone, escorted by two destroyers.Wilkinson and Astley, pp.52-53 The Norwegians withdrew up the road to the north. Reinforcements land from a German flying boat, Hemnfjorden 13–14 May 1940 However, on 10 May, in a daring move, the Germans had commandeered a coaster, , manned it with a crew detached from German destroyers and embarked 300 infantry from the 138th Mountain Regiment and two mountain guns. Nordnorge sailed from Trondheimsfjord and entered the Ranfjord, at the end of which lay Mo i Rana. The Germans landed at Hemnesberget about halfway along the fjord. Two Dornier seaplanes also landed 40 infantry and mortars. A platoon of No. 1 Independent Company and some Norwegian reservists were outnumbered and forced to escape by boat after a stiff resistance.Adams, pp.73-74 Two British warships, the anti- aircraft cruiser HMS Calcutta and the destroyer HMS Zulu, had tried too late to intercept Nordnorge. They sank Nordnorge about an hour and a half after the Germans disembarked, but then had to leave the fjord. A shuttle of seaplanes reinforced and resupplied the Germans at Hemnesberget. Counter-attacks the next day by No. 1 Independent Company and Norwegian troops failed to dislodge them. The Norwegian troops withdrawing from Mosjøen had intended to proceed by a ferry which normally docked at Hemnesberget. They had to proceed by road instead and were forced to abandon much of their equipment. Deployment of 24th Guards Brigade Alarmed by Gubbins's first reports, on 9 May Major General Mackesy had ordered that the entire British component of the Allied force attacking Narvik (24th Guards Brigade plus some supporting arms detachments), was to be diverted to the south to defend Bodø and Mo i Rana. Gubbins's force was attached to the brigade. 1st Battalion, the Scots Guards, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Byrnand Trappes-Lomax, took over the defence of Mo i Rana. It had originally been intended to deploy 1st Battalion, the Irish Guards and the Brigade HQ to Mo i Rana also, but the brigade's commander, Brigadier William Fraser, was uneasy about the position. Mo i Rana lay at the end of the long and narrow Ranfjord, with the Germans occupying Hemnesberget, and ships using it to supply the forces at Mo i Rana would be very vulnerable to air attack. The only alternative line of communication, the road from Mo i Rana to Rognan on the south side of Skjerstad Fjord, was believed incorrectly to be snowbound for several miles. The Irish Guards and the Brigade HQ were ordered to Bodø instead. Several setbacks and disasters at sea hampered the deployment of 24th Guards Brigade. On 14 May, Brigadier Fraser embarked aboard the destroyer to proceed to Mo i Rana to brief Trappes- Lomax on the new situation. Somali was attacked by German bombers and so badly damaged that it had to proceed directly to Scapa Flow for emergency repairs, carrying the brigadier with it. Gubbins, with the acting rank of Colonel, was the next senior officer in the force and assumed command.Wilkinson and Astley, pp.54-55 MS Chrobry On 15 May, the Polish troopship Chrobry, with the Irish Guards and Brigade HQ embarked, was attacked by German bombers off the southern Lofoten Islands. Bombs exploding amidships killed all the senior officers of the Irish Guards and set the ship ablaze. The destroyer HMS Wolverine and the sloop HMS Stork rescued over 700 survivors. The stoic behaviour of the Irish Guards, mustered on the foredeck of the blazing liner, was compared by the captain of Wolverine to the Birkenhead drill. The Irish Guards were sent back to Harstad to be reformed and re-equipped before setting out for Bodø again. Also lost aboard Chrobry were three light tanks of the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, the only British tanks in Norway. On 17 May, the cruiser HMS Effingham, carrying some of the personnel and most of the equipment of the 2nd Battalion, the South Wales Borderers, struck a rock about from Bodø. To avoid air attack, the cruiser had been taking an unusual route and had been proceeding at 23 knots. The South Wales Borderers also had to return to Harstad to be re-equipped, although No.2 Independent Company, which had recently arrived at Bodø, later salvaged some Bren CarriersWilkinson and Astley, p.55 and other equipment from the wreck. Effingam was finally dispatched by a torpedo on 21 May. Mo i Rana Equipment abandoned by British soldiers, Stien, Mo i Rana, 17 May 1940 The German attack against the Allied positions at Stien, about west of Mo i Rana, began on 17 May. The German force around Mosjøen was composed of five battalions and three \\"troops\\" of mountain artillery from the 2nd Mountain Division,Adams (1989), p.64 commanded by Generalleutnant Valentin Feurstein. The defending force was \\"Trappescol\\", made up of the 1st Scots Guards (less C Company at Bodø), No.1 Independent Company, a troop of 203 Battery, 51st Field Regiment Royal Artillery with four 25-pounder guns, a troop of Bofors 40 mm guns of the 55th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA, with other small detachments, and a Norwegian contingent.Rhys-Jones, p.162 The German frontal attack by the 2nd battalion of the 137th Mountain RegimentAdams (1989), p.76 along the road alongside the Ranfjord was halted, but a German outflanking force (which had commandeered skis from local farms as they advanced) fought its way down the Dalselva River (using \\"Schmeisser\\" machine-pistols effectively) and forced the defenders to withdraw. Other German ski troops (thought at the time to be paratroops dropped on a bare hillside) attacked the Scots Guards' transport near Mo i Rana to threaten Trappes-Lomax's rear. On 18 May, Gubbins arrived, bringing orders from Lieutenant General Claude Auchinleck, the recently appointed commander of the North Western Expeditionary Force, that Mo i Rana was to be firmly defended. Trappes-Lomax however insisted that the position was untenable. Since no reinforcements were available, Gubbins reluctantly concurred. \\"Trappescol\\" withdrew \\"precipitately\\" in Gubbins's words, abandoning most stores and equipment intact. B Company of the Scots Guards and No. 1 Independent Company were left behind but succeeded in rejoining the force the next day.Wilkinson and Astley, pp.57-58 (B Company had been guided by an unofficially attached Swedish officer, Captain Count Erik Lewenhaupt.)Adams (1989), p.77 On 20 May, Gubbins and Auchinleck were dismayed to find that Trappes-Lomax had continued to retreat despite having broken contact with the Germans, and was proposing to fall back across the \\"snow belt\\" north of his new position at the village of Krokstrand. Gubbins was also alarmed by the large numbers of stragglers he found north of the \\"snow belt\\", including the troop of 203 Battery RA, who had lost their communications equipment at Mo i Rana. He ordered No. 1 Independent Company to set up a control point at the ferry terminus at Rognan. He then gave Trappes-Lomax orders that there was to be no further retreat without authorisation. Pothus From the northern edge of the \\"snow belt\\", the road to Rognan followed the narrow valley of the Saltdal River. As reinforcements landed at Bodø and were moved forward by any improvised means available, Gubbins intended to man a defensive position at Storjord, south of Rognan. However, late on 22 May, Gubbins was informed that Trappes-Lomax was pulling back across the \\"snow belt\\" that night, and had retained some requisitioned buses to do so. No. 3 Independent Company, who were to have used these to move forward to reinforce the Scots Guards, had to march instead and arrived late and tired.Wilkinson and Astley, p.64 Trappes-Lomax's withdrawal had made it impossible for the Storjord position to be prepared or manned in time. The Scots Guards occupied a rearguard position north of the Viskisnoia River on 23 May. Gubbins relieved Trappes-Lomax of command in the afternoon. The Germans occupied a hill which No.3 Independent Company had arrived too late to defend and which dominated the west flank of the position, and Gubbins ordered the exhausted Scots Guards to be withdrawn to Bodø. German soldiers on the partly demolished Pothus bridge Unable to hold Storjord, Gubbins instead proposed to establish a final position running east from Finneid on the north side of Skjerstad Fjord, some east of Bodø, via a chain of lakes which formed a natural defensive line, to the Blaamannsis glacier.Terry, Chapter 14, p.212 To allow time for all units of the brigade to arrive and prepare this position, he ordered Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Stockwell (promoted from command of No. 2 Independent Company) to occupy a delaying position at Pothus south of Rognan where the Saltdal valley widened. Stockwell's force consisted of 1st Battalion, the Irish Guards (whose senior officer after the Chrobry disaster on 15 May was a Captain),Adams, p.80 Nos. 2 and 3 Independent Companies, the troop of 203 Battery RA firing their 25-pounders over open sights and a Norwegian machine-gun company reinforced by two mortars and some patrol troops. They occupied positions on both sides of the Saltdal, covering a partly demolished girder bridge which carried the main road across the river and a foot bridge across a tributary lower down. The German force advancing down the Saltdal consisted of two battalions of mountain troops, two companies of cyclists and a mountain artillery battery.Adams, p.82 Early on 25 May, the Germans began attacking the positions on the east side of the river and forced some of the defenders to fall back across it, in one case by a holding onto a line of linked rifle slings. However, some of Stockwell's reserves crossed to the east bank lower down and halted the German advance.Adams, p.81 During the night of 25/26 May, the Germans had built a temporary bridge higher up the Saltdal and transferred the main weight of their attack to the west bank, threatening to surround Stockwell's position. Earlier on 25 May, Gubbins had been informed that following the Allied disasters after the opening of the Battle of France, the force at Bodø was to be evacuated. At noon on 26 May, he ordered Stockwell to fall back to Rognan and across the fjord. Stockwell's force began to withdraw in the mid-afternoon under heavy pressure. He was aided by two Gloster Gladiator fighters (one of them flown by Rhodesian ace Caesar Hull) operating from the newly completed airstrip at Bodø. (A third had crashed on takeoff from the rough strip.) They claimed two German aircraft shot down and two damaged, challenging the German air supremacy for the first time. The Irish Guards and other troops made a fighting withdrawal to Rognan, mostly down the west side of the Saltdal, removing or destroying stores and ammunition as they fell back. From Rognan, they were evacuated by a large ferry and ten smaller \\"puffers\\". The ferry broke down and had to be towed, and the troops aboard came under fire from the leading German cyclists and were showered with burning timber from the final demolitions.Wilkinson and Astley, p.66 One company of the Irish Guards was unable to cross the river to be evacuated with the rest of the force, but extricated itself by a march of across country to a point further along the shore of the fjord. Allied evacuation In the evening of 27 May Bodø was bombed and strafed by the Luftwaffe. The improvised airstrip, the radio station and 420 of the town's 760 buildings were destroyed. Twelve people were killed and a further 5,000 were made homeless. The British force was pulled back from Finneid to Fauske, closer to Bodø, to allow for an easier evacuation. A Norwegian battalion (1st battalion, 15th Regiment) had recently arrived from Bardufoss to hold the northern part of the Finneid position. They were not immediately informed of the British withdrawal, and a company was unable to escape.Terry, Chapter 14, p.213 During three consecutive nights starting on the night of 29/30 May, the British force at Bodø was evacuated by destroyers. To avoid alerting the Germans, no noisy demolitions were carried out but vehicles and items of equipment which could not be removed were disabled and thrown into the sea. All military and civilian petrol stocks in the area were removed or destroyed.Wilkinson and Astley, p.67 There was no serious pressure from the German troops, and low cloud prevented the Luftwaffe interfering. Gubbins left on the last destroyer on the night of 31 May/1 June. The Norwegian 1st battalion, 15th Regiment, was also evacuated, by small boats, to the Lofoten Islands.Adams (1989), p.84 Aftermath The North Western Expeditionary Force evacuated Narvik and Harstad by 8 June. The first German ski patrols from their forces in Nordland made contact with General Dietl's troops near Narvik on 14 June.Terry, Chapter 14, p.215 In his report on the campaign, Auchinleck complimented Gubbins, who was awarded the DSO. Although he was recommended for the command of a division, he rejoined MI(R) and was appointed to organise the Auxiliary Units, a stay-behind force which would act against a German invasion of Britain. Later in 1940, Gubbins was appointed Director of Operations of the Special Operations Executive, and in 1943 became its Director. Although the Scots Guards had not performed well during the campaign, Trappes-Lomax argued that they were not equipped or trained for the conditions they encountered (having been employed on Public duties immediately before being deployed to Norway) and were exhausted by continual air attack. Trappes-Lomax was eventually promoted to Brigadier and served as a staff officer in Southern Command in India. The Independent Companies were disbanded after the Norwegian Campaign, though some of their personnel transferred to the commandos. Lieutenant Colonel Stockwell, who was also awarded the DSO, ran a Commando Training Centre at Lochailort before being appointed to command a brigade and eventually a division.

A. (1931), Capillary conduction of liquids through porous mediums, J. Appl. Phys., 1(5), 318–333. for simulating the movement of water in unsaturated soils. The finite water-content method solves the advection- like term of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation, which is an ordinary differential equation alternative to the Richards partial differential equation. The Richards equation is difficult to approximate in general because it does not have a closed-form analytical solution except in a few cases.Ross, P.J., and J.-Y. Parlange (1994). Comparing exact and numerical solutions of Richards equation for one-dimensional infiltration and drainage. Soil Sci. Vol 1557, No. 6, pp. 341-345. The finite water-content method, is perhaps the first generic replacement for the numerical solution of the Richards' equation. The finite water-content solution has several advantages over the Richards equation solution. First, as an ordinary differential equation it is explicit, guaranteed to converge Yu, H., C. C. Douglas, and F. L. Ogden, (2012), A new application of dynamic data driven system in the Talbot–Ogden model for groundwater infiltration, Procedia Computer Science, 9, 1073–1080. and computationally inexpensive to solve. Second, using a finite volume solution methodology it is guaranteed to conserve mass. The finite water content method readily simulates sharp wetting fronts, something that the Richards solution struggles with.Tocci, M. D., C. T. Kelley, and C. T. Miller (1997), Accurate and economical solution of the pressure-head form of Richards' equation by the method of lines, Adv. Wat. Resour., 20(1), 1–14. The main limiting assumption required to use the finite water-content method is that the soil be homogeneous in layers. Finite Water-Content discretization. The porous medium is divided into n uniform \\"bins\\" of Delta theta water content. The finite water-content vadose zone flux method is derived from the same starting point as the derivation of Richards' equation. However, the derivation employs a hodograph transformationPhilip, J. R. 1957. The theory of infiltration: 1. The infiltration equation and its solution, Soil Sci, 83(5), 345–357. to produce an advection solution that does not include soil water diffusivity, wherein z becomes the dependent variable and theta becomes an independent variable: :left(frac{dz}{dt}right)_theta = frac{partial K(theta)}{partial theta} left[ 1- left (frac{partial psi(theta)}{partial z}right) right] where: :K is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], :psi is the capillary pressure head [L] (negative for unsaturated soil), :z is the vertical coordinate [L] (positive downward), :theta is the water content, (−) and :t is time [T]. This equation was converted into a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Method of Lineshttp://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Method_of_lines to convert the partial derivatives on the right-hand side of the equation into appropriate finite difference forms. These three ODEs represent the dynamics of infiltrating water, falling slugs, and capillary groundwater, respectively. Derivation A superior derivation was publishedOgden,F.L., M.B. Allen, W.Lai, J. Zhu, C.C. Douglas, M. Seo, and C.A. Talbot, 2017. The Soil Moisture Velocity Equation, J. Adv. Modeling Earth Syst.https://doi.org/10.1002/2017MS000931 in 2017, showing that this equation is a diffusion-free version of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation. One way to solve this equation is to solve it for q(theta,t) and z(theta,t) by integration:Wilson, J. L. (1974), Dispersive mixing in a partially saturated porous medium, PhD dissertation, 355pp., Dept. of Civil Engrg., Mass. Inst. Tech., Cambridge, MA. : int frac{partial q}{partial theta} , dtheta = int frac{partial z}{partial t} , dtheta Instead, a finite water-content discretization is used and the integrals are replaced with summations: : sum_{j=1}^N left[frac{partial q}{partial theta}right]_j Delta theta = sum_{j=1}^N left[frac{partial z}{partial t}right]_j Delta theta where N is the total number of finite water content bins. Using this approach, the conservation equation for each bin is: : left[frac{partial q}{partial theta}right]_j = left[frac{partial z}{partial t}right]_j. The method of lines is used to replace the partial differential forms on the right-hand side into appropriate finite-difference forms. This process results in a set of three ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of infiltration fronts, falling slugs, and groundwater capillary fronts using a finite water-content discretization. Method essentials The finite water- content vadose zone flux calculation method replaces the Richards' equation PDE with a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These three ODEs are developed in the following sections. Furthermore, because the finite water-content method does not explicitly include soil water diffusivity, it necessitates a separate capillary relaxation step. Capillary relaxation Moebius, F., D. Canone, and D. Or (2012), Characteristics of acoustic emissions induced by fluid front displacement in porous media, Water Resour. Res., 48(11), W11507, doi:10.1029/2012WR012525. represents a free-energy minimization process at the pore scale that produces no advection beyond the REV scale. Infiltration fronts Infiltration fronts in finite water- content domain. With reference to Figure 1, water infiltrating the land surface can flow through the pore space between theta_d and theta_i. In the context of the method of lines, the partial derivative terms are replaced with: : frac{partial K(theta)}{partial theta}=frac{K(theta_d)-K(theta_i)}{theta_d-theta_i}. Given that any ponded depth of water on the land surface is h_p, the Green and Ampt (1911)Green, W. H., and G. A. Ampt (1911), Studies on soil physics, 1, The flow of air and water through soils, J. Agric. Sci., 4(1), 1–24. assumption is employed, : frac{partial psi(theta)}{partial z}=frac{psi(theta_d)+h_p}{z_j}, represents the capillary head gradient that is driving the flow. Therefore the finite water-content equation in the case of infiltration fronts is: : left(frac{dz}{dt}right)_j= frac{K(theta_d)-K(theta_i)}{theta_d-theta_i} left(frac{psi(theta_d)+h_p}{z_j}+1right). Falling slugs Falling slugs in the finite water-content domain. The water in each bin is considered a separate slug. After rainfall stops and all surface water infiltrates, water in bins that contains infiltration fronts detaches from the land surface. Assuming that the capillarity at leading and trailing edges of this 'falling slug' of water is balanced, then the water falls through the media at the incremental conductivity associated with the j^text{th} Deltatheta bin: : left(frac{dz}{dt}right)_j= frac{K(theta_j)-K(theta_{j-1})}{theta_j -theta_{j-1}} Capillary groundwater fronts Groundwater capillary fronts in finite water-content domain. In this case, the flux of water to the j^text{th} bin occurs between bin j and i. Therefore in the context of the method of lines: : frac{partial K(theta)}{partial theta}= frac{K(theta_j)-K(theta_i)}{theta_j - theta_i}, and, : frac{partialpsi(theta)}{partial z} = frac{psi(theta_j)}{H_j} which yields: : left(frac{dz}{dt}right)_j= frac{K(theta_j)-K(theta_i)}{theta_j - theta_i} left(frac{psi(theta_j)}{H_j}-1right). The performance of this equation was verified for cases where the groundwater table velocity was less than 0.92 K_s,Ogden, F. L., W. Lai, R. C. Steinke, and J. Zhu (2015b), Validation of finite water-content vadose zone dynamics method using column experiments with a moving water table and applied surface flux, Water Resour. Res., 10.1002/2014WR016454. using a column experiment fashioned after that by Childs and Poulovassilis (1962).Childs, E. C., and A. Poulovassilis (1962), The moisture profile above a moving water table, J. Soil Sci., 13(2), 271–285. Results of that validation showed that the finite water-content vadose zone flux calculation method performed comparably to the numerical solution of Richards' equation. Capillary relaxation Because the hydraulic conductivity rapidly increases as the water content moves towards saturation, with reference to Fig.1, right-most bins in both capillary groundwater fronts and infiltration fronts can \\"out-run\\" their neighbors to the left. In the finite water content discretization, these shocksSmith, R. E. (1983), Approximate soil water movement by kinematic characteristics, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 47(1), 3–8. are dissipated by the process of capillary relaxation, which represents a pore-scale free-energy minimization process that produces no advection beyond the REV scale Numerically, this process is a numerical sort that places the fronts in monotonically-decreasing magnitude from left- right. Constitutive relations The finite water content vadose zone flux method works with any monotonic water retention curve/unsaturated hydraulic conductivity relations such as Brooks and CoreyBrooks, R.H., and A.T. Corey, 1964. Hydraulic properties of porous media. Hydrol. Pap. 3, Colo. State Univ., Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. Clapp and Hornberger Clapp R.B., and G.M. Hornberger, 1978. Empirical equations for some soil hydraulic properties. Water Resour. Res. 14(4):601–604 and van Genuchten-Mualem.van Genuchten, M. Th. (1980). \\"A Closed-Form Equation for Predicting the Hydraulic Conductivity of Unsaturated Soils\\" (PDF). Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 44 (5): 892-898. doi:10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400050002x The method might work with hysteretic water retention relations- these have not yet been tested. Limitations The finite water content method lacks the effect of soil water diffusion. This omission does not affect the accuracy of flux calculations using the method because the mean of the diffusive flux is small. Practically, this means that the shape of the wetting front plays no role in driving the infiltration. The method is thus far limited to 1-D in practical applications. The infiltration equation was extended to 2- and quasi-3 dimensions. More work remains in extending the entire method into more than one dimension. Awards The paper describing this method was selected by the Early Career Hydrogeologists Network of the International Association of Hydrogeologists to receive the \\"Coolest paper Published in 2015\\" award in recognition of the potential impact of the publication on the future of hydrogeology.

Biography  Venice Nocturne He was born to a family of wealthy farmers.Brief biography @ Portal de Arte. His younger brother, Luis, also became a diplomat and was a popular novelist, among other achievements. He began his education at the English school of Mathews and Linacre. Later, due to economic problems, he was enrolled at the Instituto Nacional, where he began painting. He had his first showing in 1872, at a competition celebrating the establishment of the Mercado Central de Santiago, organized by Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna.Brief biography @ Biografías y Vidas. In 1873, with the support of his mother, he went to Europe, accompanied by his sister Elena and his future brother-in-law, Pedro Lira. Originally, it was intended that he would study medicine at the Sorbonne, but he chose to pursue painting instead and found a position in the workshops of Alexandre Cabanel, followed by studies at the Académie Julian. His work was recognized by the Chilean government and he was granted a stipend that enabled him to participate in the Salon of 1877 and travel to Italy, where he remained for almost ten years, painting landscapes and cityscapes. He got married there in 1883 and, five years later, was appointed consul in Venice. He returned to Chile in 1890 then, two years later, accepted an appointment as consul in Seville. During this period, his palette brightened and he added fruits and flowers to his canvases. Although he did not personally participate in exhibitions or competitions, his mother quietly made arrangements and he won several awards in Chile. Consul General The Lagoon in O'Higgins Park He returned to Chile for a few years then, in 1897, he was offered the position of Consul General for Italy, with his headquarters in Genoa. He had come to look upon Italy as a second home, so he gladly accepted, but discovered that his workload left little time for painting. By 1914, he was once again living in Rome. Despite the problems caused by World War I, he wanted to stay, but his wife became ill and could not be treated properly there, so they returned to Chile. The improved medical care was of no avail, however, and she died soon after. This, together with the premature death of one of his daughters, resulted in a severe depression that made him increasingly isolated and unsociable; a state of mind which is reflected in his works of that period. He died peacefully at home, a virtual hermit, and was buried in the family vault next to his wife.

He lives in London, and was born in Belfast Northern Ireland on 1 March 1949.  Early life  Born in Belfast Northern Ireland, he is the son of Mary (née Magee) and Billy Finnegan, a bricklayer. He went to St Mary's Grammar School where he was taught by the Irish Christian Brothers. At the outbreak of 'the Troubles' in Northern Ireland, he became a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement and the People's Democracy (a left wing student group led by amongst others, Bernadette McAliskey née Devlin). In 1971 he went to Manchester to read English, Drama and Education where he graduated and qualified as a teacher. He later moved to London where he taught at the Jews' Free School from 1974-1978.  Career  Finnegan's first major play Act of Union was produced in 1980 at the Soho Poly Theatre with the support of Bill Ash and of which Irving Wardle wrote in The Times: \\"It may seem a negative compliment to this extremely informative and well-written piece, but its main achievements are to have developed a highly theatrical pattern from dislocated fragments, and to have exposed some of the tangled loyalties and hatreds of the divided country without the smallest trace of sectarian bias\\". Soldiers, North and Mary's Men soon followed in the quartet of 'Troubles' plays. In 1982, at the invitation of Kariel Gardosh, the Israeli Cultural Attaché in London, Finnegan's play James Joyce And The Israelites was performed at the First International Conference and Festival of Jewish Theater in Tel Aviv. \\"An evening of undivided enjoyment... a non-Jewish play on a Jewish subject done with much understanding and sympathy\\" (Jerusalem Post). In 1984, Tout, a play about informers in Northern Ireland was commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company and performed at the Barbican as part of the Thought Crimes At The Barbican season in memory of George Orwell and his 1984. 1986 saw the production of The War Trilogy which included The Spanish Play, The German Connection and subsequently for BBC Radio 3 The Cemetery of Europe. Of The German Connection, which opened at the Young Vic, Andrew Rissik wrote in The Independent: 'Seamus Finnegan's The German Connection is an outstanding new play whose theme is tellingly summarised in the line, \\"Betrayal can make monsters of people... Finnegan's writing cuts through the potential melodrama with heart-breaking perception and skill... his dialogue has an urgent workaday vigour...\\" In the mid-nineties, Finnegan was writer in residence at Mishkenot Sha’ananim in Jerusalem, where he collaborated with Israeli dramatist Miriam Kainy on Hypatia and began work on his book about Israeli playwrights, Dialogues In Exile, with the help and support of Dani Horovitz, another Israeli dramatist.

He was the founder of LAUNCH Media and the CEO of SurveyMonkey. He was married to Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook. Early life and education Goldberg was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 2, 1967 and grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His mother, Paula Goldberg, is co-founder and executive director of the Pacer Center, and his father, Melvin Bert \\"Mel\\" Goldberg (1942–1998), was associate dean and professor at the William Mitchell College of Law. He interned at the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper while in high school. He graduated from Blake School in Minneapolis in 1985, and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1989, majoring in history and government. Goldberg was an enthusiastic Minnesota Vikings fan throughout his life. Career Goldberg worked for Bain & Company for two years after graduating from college. He had planned to attend law school but instead joined Capitol Records, where he served as director of marketing strategy and new business development. He founded LAUNCH Media in 1994, and led it through its acquisition by Yahoo Inc. in 2001. He quit Yahoo in 2007 and joined Benchmark Capital. He then joined SurveyMonkey in 2009. Personal life In 2004, Goldberg married Sheryl Sandberg. The couple had two children and lived in Menlo Park, California. Prior to his death, he and Sandberg were active philanthropists, signing The Giving Pledge. Death and memorials On May 1, 2015, Goldberg died suddenly while vacationing with Sandberg at a private beach-front villa near the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts in Punta Mita, Mexico; he was pronounced dead at a hospital in Nuevo Vallarta. Goldberg's death was initially attributed to falling off a treadmill while exercising at a gym and suffering head trauma and blood loss. Sandberg has subsequently said that her husband's death was due to an arrhythmia caused by undiagnosed coronary artery disease, and not due to falling from a treadmill. Goldberg's brother, Robert, described his family's \\"incredible shock and sadness,\\" in an online post asking well-wishers to post photos and memories to his Facebook profile page. \\"In lieu of donations, we want to celebrate his life in a manner that respects the family's privacy as they cope with this tragic, life-changing event,\\" Robert Goldberg wrote. Tributes to Goldberg were posted to social media across the Silicon Valley community. A spokesperson for Facebook said its executives were \\"heartbroken by this news.\\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in a post that Goldberg was \\"an amazing person and I am glad I got to know him.\\" \\"One of the truly great people on the planet, Dave was of almost unimaginably remarkable character,\\" said Dick Costolo, Twitter's chief executive. \\"One of kindest and most generous friends I've known,\\" said Jeff Weiner, chief executive of LinkedIn. Professional poker player Phil Helmuth, who was a friend, donated his historic 14th World Series of Poker bracelet to Goldberg's family. A memorial service for Goldberg was held at Stanford Memorial Auditorium on the Stanford University campus on May 5, 2015. The 90-minute service was attended by many members of what Fortune described as \\"the elite of Silicon Valley,\\" as well as U2 frontman Bono, who performed his song \\"One,\\" and actor Ben Affleck. Affleck had worked with Goldberg when he served on the Board of Directors of a company he co-founded called Live Planet and the two had also worked together on The Eastern Congo Initiative, for which Goldberg helped Affleck raise funds. Sheryl Sandberg, Goldberg's wife, wrote a Facebook post with an essay commemorating Goldberg 30 days after his death (sheloshim period), talking about her own struggle overcoming the grief of his death and the support that her loved ones had given her in this difficult time. The post was liked by more than 900,000 people, shared 400,000 times, and received over 70,000 comments. It was also discussed in Business Insider and the New York Times.

William Fraser, of Fraserfield (19 November 1691 – 23 March 1727) was a Scottish Jacobite politician. He was the second of the two sons of William Fraser, 12th Lord Saltoun (1654–1715) and his wife Margaret (died 1734), daughter of James Sharp, the Archbishop of St Andrews who was murdered by Scottish Covenanters in 1679. Fraser was admitted as an advocate in 1713, and in 1724 he married Lady Katherine Anne Erskine, daughter of the 9th Earl of Buchan. They had one son, William Fraser (1725–1788). Fraser took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, but was later pardoned. In 1721 he bought the estate of Balgownie (near Aberdeen) from Lord Gray, and called it Fraserfield. John Baptist de Medina At the 1722 general election, Fraser was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Elgin Burghs. However, this was the second successive election in which two rival delegates had claimed to represent one of the burghs, and both votes had been counted. In 1715, the election petition was promptly resolved against the returned Jacobite James Murray, and the pro- government John Campbell seated in his place. When the House of Commons debated Campbell's petition against Fraser in October 1722, it was expected to similarly oust the Jacobite. However, Fraser's maiden speech was so effective that he won enough support for Campbell's allies not to press the motion. Instead, the petition was referred to the elections committee, who in January 1725 gave the seat to Campbell. In April that year Fraser unsuccessfully contested the by-election in Linlithgow Burghs following the death of Daniel Weir. His petition against the result was rejected.

Justin Herman (died 1971) was an American public administrator. From 1951 to 1959 he was head of the regional office of the Housing and Home Finance Agency in San Francisco, California. From 1959 until his death in 1971 he was head of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. Under his administration, large areas of the city were redeveloped; thousands of residents, many of them poor and non-white, were forced to leave their homes and businesses. Career Herman was appointed executive director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency by George Christopher in April 1959. He was an experienced administrator with significant connections in the federal government and an extensive knowledge of urban redevelopment. He had the support of the Bay Area Council, of the Blyth-Zellerbach Committee and of the San Francisco Planning and Urban Renewal Association. He greatly expanded the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, from about 60 employees before he took office to 462 shortly after his death. Herman was responsible for the redevelopment, in two phases, of the Western Addition and for the transformation of Geary Street into Geary Boulevard. In the second phase of the Western Addition project, 10,000 people were displaced and more than 60 city blocks cleared by 1970. The agency also aggressively acquired land in Chinatown, the Golden Gateway, the port area, South of Market and the Tenderloin, expropriating poor people from those areas. Herman died of a heart attack in 1971. Reception The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials makes an annual M. Justin Herman Award. Justin Herman Plaza, opposite the Ferry Building, was named for him until October 19, 2017. While Herman's actions were largely supported by the elite of the city and by banks, businesses and the city government, his reputation among those he displaced from their homes was very low. Thomas Fleming described him in 1965 as the \\"arch-villain in the black depopulation of the city\\", while Hannibal Williams of the Western Addition Community Association said \\"We didn't know who the devil was. But we knew who Justin Herman was and that was the devil for us\\". In July 2017, San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution which would temporarily rename Justin Herman Plaza to Embarcadero Plaza until a new permanent name could be attached, citing Herman's role in displacing poor and minority residents from the Western Addition, Fillmore, Chinatown, and South of Market neighborhoods. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the resolution unanimously on September 19, 2017. The new name would need to be decided by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission, which has jurisdiction over naming public spaces. Peskin stated the site's owner, Boston Properties, told him they would cover the cost (estimated at ) of replacing the plaque bearing Herman's name. The plaza is officially known as Embarcadero Plaza. See also *Robert Moses *Modernist architecture *Federal Power Commission v.

History The castle was most likely built by Mikołaj Firlej at the beginning of the sixteenth century and expanded by his son, Piotr, the Voivode of the Ruski Voivodeship. The bastion, used as a residence, was destroyed by the Swedish army in 1655 during The Deluge. Although the following owners of the castle did their very best to rebuild the castle, the castle never managed to regain its former glory. In 1928, an archaeologist, Leon Kozłowski had taken over the castle, but his plans to reconstruct the castle were stopped by the Second World War. After the Second World War, the castle was left in its former state, being one of many private castles. In 1975, the castle was bought by the Nadwiślańskie Museum in Kazimierz Dolny in Poland.

Early life Hoşyar Kadın was the adopted daughter of Beyhan Sultan, daughter of Sultan Mustafa III, and cousin of the Sultan Mahmud. Marriage In 1810, Beyhan Sultan gave a grand banquet to Mahmud. During this time, he offered Hoşyar's hand in marriage to him. Beyhan consented to his offer and, after some days, sent her to the imperial harem, with a grand ceremony, and with magnificent presents, which she gave her as her dower. For ten days, the Sultan was most assiduous in his attentions; after that period, he showed himself no more. On 29 June 1812, she gave birth to her first daughter, Mihrimah Sultan. She was followed two years later by another daughter, Şah Sultan, born on 14 October 1814. She died at the age of two on 13 April 1817. When the time came to get Mihrimah Sultan a husband, Hoşyar resolved that she should make her choice. She showed her the portraits of several young men, each worthy of her hand. She fixed upon Said Pasha, and the two married in 1835. Shortly after his marriage to her daughter, Said Pasha had incurred Mahmud's displeasure and been exiled to the provinces, to his wife's and mother-in-law's distress. At this time, Hoşyar had sufficiently sure of her influence to petition Mahmud directly and did so in a letter. She followed this up with two letters of thanks, one when Mahmud granted her request and ordered Said Pasha brought back to Istanbul, the other when he arrived. Very few months had elapsed when Mihrimah died in 1838 in childbirth, and with her, Hoşyar's last solace disappeared. With the death of Mahmud in 1839, she lost her influence at the court. Widowhood In later years she settled in her palace, situated at Tarlabaşı, facing Dolmabahçe Palace. She also met Melek Hanim, wife of grand vizier Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha. Melek described her being tall and fair-haired, and her skin, exceedingly white, set off the freshness of her complexion. Knowing that Melek had been in Europe, Hoşyar interrogated her as to the manners and customs of the Christians, the way the towns were built, the balls, theatres, systems of lighting by gas, the architecture of the palaces, and a thousand other matters. Bezmiâlem Sultan, the mother of Sultan Abdulmejid I always regarded her with a jealous eye. She scarcely allows her to receive, once a month, a visit from Said Pasha when he was in Istanbul. Moreover, she was never allowed to hear of her daughter spoken of. In 1840, she commissioned a fountain in Elhac, Kasımpaşa. In 1844, she commissioned a school in Burgaz. She also commissioned a mosque. Death In 1859, Hoşyar went for a pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca, where she died. Issue Together with Mahmud, Hoşyar had two children: * Mihrimah Sultan (Topkapı Palace, 29 June 1812 - Istanbul, Turkey, 31 August 1838, buried in Nakşidil Sultan Mausoleum), married and had issue; * Şah Sultan (14 October 1814 - 13 April 1817, buried in Nuruosmaniye Mosque); In popular culture *In 2018 Turkish historical fiction TV series Kalbimin Sultanı, Hoşyar is portrayed by Turkish actress Beste Kökdemir.

Bade in 1988 William George Bade (29 May 1924, Oakland, California – 10 August 2012, Oakland, California) was an American mathematician, who did his most significant work on Banach algebras.In Memoriam: William George Bade 1924–2012, University of California Biography William G. Bade's father was the famous scholar William F. Badè, who died in 1936. After his father's death, William G. Bade moved with his mother and sister from Berkeley to San Diego, where he graduated from high school in 1942. He spent his freshman year in college at Pomona College and then, under the V-12 Navy College Training Program, studied at Caltech, where he received his bachelor's physics degree in 1945. He received more training which continued until after the end of WW II. After active duty as a Disbursing Officer in the U. S. Navy on the atoll of Truk, he was released from active duty in 1947 but was in the U. S. Naval Reserve until 1955. Bade earned a mathematics PhD in 1951 at UCLA under Angus Ellis Taylor with thesis An Operational Calculus for Operators with Spectrum Confined to a Strip. In the fall of 1951 Bade started teaching at UC Berkeley. Bade's research started out in operator theory, but he soon moved into Banach algebras where he made fundamental contributions to the field of automatic continuity. In particular, his joint work with Philip C. Curtis, Jr., on the structure of homomorphisms from commutative C*-algebras into Banach algebras and Wedderburn decompositions of Banach algebras had a major impact on the development of Banach algebra theory. He remained active as a researcher well into his mid-70s, and his last paper - on Wedderburn decompositions - appeared in 2000. On 2 July 1952 he married Eleanor \\"Elly\\" Jane Barry and they moved to Connecticut where he worked at Yale University until 1955. Bade and Robert Bartle were research assistants from 1952 to 1954 working on Part I of Linear Operators by Nelson Dunford and Jacob T. Schwartz. In the fall of 1955 William and Eleanor Bade, with two children, returned to Berkeley, where William Bade had an appointment as an assistant professor in the UC Berkeley mathematics department. At Berkeley he became associate professor in 1959, full professor in 1964, and retired in 1991 as professor emeritus. Bade supervised 24 doctoral dissertations. He was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012, the year in which he died. Upon his death, he was survived by his wife, six children, and seven grandchildren.

The towers located in the four corners of the castle's square formation help to defend the stronghold, and additional 10 metre high defensive walls. Due to dozens of reconstructions and expansions of the castle, the militaristic stronghold transformed into a royal residence. In the fifteenth century, the castle was raised by an additional level and a raised courtyard. In 1547, the stronghold changed its function into an aristocratic residence. It was the last period of the stronghold's glory. After the Third Partition of Poland, the stronghold became part of Prussia, and was partially deconstructed for cheap building material. In 1818, the castle was owned by the House of Krasiński, in the twentieth century the castle was fully rebuilt.

She was born in London and attended Putney High School and also received education in Paris. She decided to become a tennis player after seeing Henri Cochet play at Wimbledon. Between 1931 and 1939 she participated in eight Wimbledon Championships and in seven editions she competed in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles events. Her best result in the singles event was reaching the quarterfinal in 1939 in which she lost to Hilde Sperling in straight sets. In the 1934 mixed doubles event she reached the quarterfinal partnering Iwao Aoki. Her best singles performance at a Grand Slam tournament was reaching the semifinal of the 1940 U.S. Championships in which she was defeated in three sets by Helen Jacobs. In July 1931 Hardwick was the runner-up at the singles event of the Canadian Championships after she had to default in the final against compatriot Evelyn Dearman. With Dearman she also won the doubles title. In 1933 she became the Welsh singles champion in Newport. Hardwick won three titles at the Scandinavian Indoor Championships as well as the French indoor title. During the autumn and winter of 1934 she received coaching from Dan Maskell. In 1934 and 1936 she was a finalist at the British Covered Court Championships played at the Queen's Club. At the same location in 1935 she won the singles, doubles and mixed doubles events of the London Covered Court Championships. In 1936, 1937 and 1938 Hardwick was part of the British Wightman Cup team as a singles player. All three editions were won by the United States and Hardwick was not able to win any of her matches although she took a set against both Helen Jacobs and Alice Marble in the 1937 edition. She defeated Kay Stammers in the final to win the singles title at the Surrey Hard Court Championships, played on clay courts, in April 1939 and that year she achieved her highest world ranking of No. 8. With Margaret Osborne she won the 1940 doubles title at the Pacific Coast Championships in Berkeley. In November 1940 Hardwick turned professional, in part to improve her family's financial situation during the war, and she made her debut on 7 January 1941 against Alice Marble in front of a crowd of almost 12,000 at the Madison Square Garden. The match, which she lost in two close sets, was the first on a transcontinental tour in the United States with a professional group that also included Don Budge and Bill Tilden. Marble decisively won the series again Hardwick with 17–3 after having led 17–1. At the end of the 1940 tour the score was 58–3 in favour of Marble. In the mixed doubles matches Hardwick would usually team-up with Budge against Marble and Tilden, the latter team winning narrowly by 25–21. In January 1943 she married Charles Hare, a British tennis player and referee whom she met in the United States. After her active tennis career she stayed involved with the sport and was a regular contributor to the Lawn Tennis and Badminton and World Tennis magazines. She played an important role in the founding of the Federation Cup when she convinced the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in 1962 that such an event would have wide support. Her brother Derek was the chairman of the British Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and president of the International Tennis Federation.

The trail extends from Cascade Locks on the Columbia River south to Siskiyou Summit near the Oregon-California border. The century-old trail is a foot and equestrian path that passes through nine wilderness areas, Crater Lake National Park, and Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument. Historically known as the Oregon Skyline Trail or Skyline Trail, the entire length of the trail was incorporated into the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail in 1968. History The Oregon Skyline Trail was established in 1920 when a United States Forest Service team led by ranger Fredrick William Cleator explored and marked a route between Mount Hood and Crater Lake. The route was described as “a combination or connection of rough mountain trail and road, located or constructed in disjointed manner, at different times by forest rangers, stockmen, miners, trappers and Indians.”A series of Oregon Skyline Trail maps and accompanying trail descriptions were produced by the USDA Forest Service from 1921 to 1965. Subsequently maps of the Oregon Section of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail were issued in 1969, 1970, and 1972. Large, high- resolution scans of these maps are available at Trail Advocates. In 1926 the idea of a continuous trail extending from Canada to Mexico was proposed, and creation of a Pacific Crest Trail System was underway. This system was to link several existing long-distance trails including the Cascade Crest Trail in Washington; the Oregon Skyline Trail; and the Tahoe–Yosemite Trail and John Muir Trail in California. By 1936 the Oregon Skyline Trail had been extended to reach across the state, from the Columbia Gorge Ranger Station near the town of Cascade Locks south to beyond Soda Mountain, just a few miles from the California border. The trail was then about long and had been extensively relocated to more closely follow the backbone of the mountains, thereby affording hikers and equestrians more scenic views. In 1968 the Pacific Crest Trail System was designated as the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail or Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). The Oregon Skyline Trail was integrated into the new trail and was then referred to as the Oregon Section of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Today the name Oregon Skyline Trail is more often used in a historical context. Route The Oregon Section of the PCT (Oregon Skyline Trail), as it is currently routed, extends . The northern terminus is at the Bridge of the Gods in Cascade Locks, Oregon. The trail then courses south at or near the crest of the Cascade Mountains, passing prominent volcanoes and natural features. The trail passes through the Mark O. Hatfield, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Mount Washington, Three Sisters, and Diamond Peak Wilderness Areas, Crater Lake National Park, the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, which includes the Soda Mountain Wilderness. Near Pilot Rock, the trail comes to within two miles of the California border before extending further west to its southern terminus at Siskiyou Summit. The low point of the trail is at Bridge of the Gods (elevation ), and the high point of the trail is on a saddle north of Mount Thielsen (elevation ). Altogether, there is of elevation gain and of elevation loss on a north-to-south trip. Many stretches of the Oregon Skyline Trail have been rerouted since its inception in 1920. Some of the old paths are still in use today and are considered alternate paths to the standard PCT route. Other segments have been abandoned and nature has rendered them nearly undetectable. These old paths continue to be of interest to those studying the history of the Oregon Skyline Trail.Personal pages and blogs posted on the web illustrate the continued interest in the historical significance of the Oregon Skyline Trail and its abandoned routes. These resources may be valuable to others desiring to explore the trail's history. Southern Terminus The southernmost of the trail were the last to be developed. The 1934 reconnaissance report of William Royer and the 1936 Forest Service trail map indicate an intent to route the trail from Old Baldy to the southwest toward Soda Mountain and Pilot Rock near Siskiyou Summit. This route would have kept the trail primarily on public lands. However, by 1945 the trail had been oriented in a more southerly direction, primarily along unpaved roads and through private property, to Copco Lake in northern California. Here the trail was connected to a path that continued the Pacific Crest Trail System south into California. In 1973, the announced route of the newly designated Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail showed the trail once again oriented southwest from Old Baldy and on to Siskiyou Summit. Siskiyou Summit is identified as the southern terminus of the Oregon Section of the PCT. Hiking Permits are required for overnight stays in some wilderness areas along the Oregon Skyline Trail/PCT and the alternate routes. These free, self-issued permits can be obtained while on the trail, usually at the wilderness boundary. Camping in the backcountry of Crater Lake National Park requires a permit. Signing the register where the trail enters the Park serves as a permit for Oregon Skyline Trail/PCT thru hikers. The trail crosses paved roads at or near Barlow Pass, Santiam Pass, McKenzie Pass, Willamette Pass, Crater Lake National Park, Fish Lake, and Green Springs Summit, which facilitates resupplying for thru hikers and provides trail access for section hikers. Multiple resupply options are available near the trail. Access to water in southern Oregon can be limited and long stretches of waterless trail can be expected.

The story was first recorded in the Bychowiec Chronicle, a generally unreliable source from the early 16th century, and was further embellished, conflated, and confused by later chroniclers and historians. Nonetheless, the cult of the martyrs spread in the 16th century. A prominent monument in Vilnius, the Three Crosses, was originally erected in their memory sometime before 1648. Around the same time Bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz started canonization procedures, but they were abandoned. At the advent of critical historiography in the 20th century, the story was dismissed as fictional in its entirety. However, newer research attempts to restore some credibility to the legend. Story in the Bychowiec Chronicle Illustration of the fourteen martyrs from 1803 As told by the Bychowiec Chronicle, Voivode of Vilnius Petras Goštautas married a Polish lady from the House of Buczacki and converted to Catholicism. He invited 14 Franciscan friars from Podolia to Vilnius and built them a friary. At the time the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was still a pagan country; it would convert to Christianity in 1387. The friars began preaching the Christian faith and badmouthing pagan gods. That angered city residents. While Algirdas was away at war with Moscow and Goštautas was away in Tykocin, the residents burned down the friary and killed the friars. Seven friars were beheaded while other seven where nailed to a cross and tossed into the Neris river. Upon their return, Goštautas provided proper burial to the slain men and Algirdas ordered execution of 500 city residents. Goštautas also founded a new friary (today's Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). The story was repeated by Maciej Stryjkowski (1547–1593), Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz (1609–1677), and other historians who added and modified various details. These authors increased the number of martyrs to 36, including Goštautas himself who was also a bishop, and dated the event in 1332 or 1333. Martinus Baronius (1602) provided not only names, but also titles and positions of the martyrs. Matters were so confused that some authors, including Kazimierz Biernacki and Antonius Melissanus de Macro, claimed that there were two separate incidents – one where 14 and another where 36 Franciscans were martyred. Cult of the martyrs Church of the Holy Cross traces its roots to a 1543 chapel dedicated to the Franciscan martyrs The first document mentioning the cult of the martyrs is a 1543 letter by Bishop Paweł Holszański. He described a monument – a column with a cross – that survived a major city fire that destroyed Vilnius Cathedral and Bishops' Palace in July 1530. He also attributed full recovery of severely ill Jan Andruszewicz, future Bishop of Kiev, to the intercession of the martyrs. Inspired by these events, in 1543, Holszański built a Gothic Chapel of the Holy Cross where the martyrs were allegedly buried. Two years later, Andruszewicz wrote a hymn to the martyrs which closely echoes information in the Bychowiec Chronicle. It was carved into a marble plaque and hung in the chapel. The hymn was also published in Annales Minorum by Luke Wadding. The chapel was restored in 1598 and eventually it grew into the Church of the Holy Cross. Bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz started an official canonization case in 1649 and ordered a search of the remains of the martyrs. The results of the search are not known. It is likely that canonization efforts were abandoned due to the Russo-Polish War (1654–67) and Tyszkiewicz's death in 1656. Three wooden crosses were built on the Bleak Hill (now in Kalnai Park) where the martyrs were reportedly beheaded. The exact date of the construction is unknown, but it was possibly related to the efforts of canonization. The first undoubted representation is from a 1648 panegyric to Bishop Tyszkiewicz. According to Jan Nepomucen Fijałek, the Three Crosses were also depicted on two silver portraits of St. Casimir that were made in 1636 and were present in Vilnius Cathedral until the first half of the 20th century. Wooden crosses would rot and needed to be periodically replaced. Concrete monuments were erected in 1916 (architect Antoni Wiwulski; torn down in 1950) and 1989 (architect Henrikas Šilgalis). Analysis Historical inaccuracies The Bychowiec Chronicle provides a detailed description of the life of Petras Goštautas. He is not known from any other sources and details of his life cannot be reliably verified. Some of the details outright contradict facts known from other reliable contemporary sources. For example, Vilnius Voivodeship was established only in 1413 by Vytautas; therefore Goštautas could not be a voivode during the reign of Algirdas. But it could be a confusion with Jonas Goštautas who was the voivode in 1443–58. The chronicle also mentions that Goštautas was appointed as regent of Podolia by Algirdas; in fact it was Petras Mantigirdaitis who was appointed by Vytautas. Polish historian Kazimierz Chodynicki expressed doubts about Goštautas' marriage to a member of the House of Buczacki as the family came into prominence only after Algirdas' death. Goštautas is also not known as the founder of the Franciscan church and friary in Vilnius. The first more sizable donation by Goštautai to the Franciscans in Vilnius is known only from 1468. The Bychowiec Chronicle also mentions that the first Bishop of Vilnius was Motiejus, a friar from a local Franciscan friary. No such bishop is known; the first bishop was Andrzej Jastrzębiec. Historical basis Polish historian Kazimierz Chodynicki was the first to critically evaluate the story in 1927. He noted clear similarities between the story in the Bychowiec Chronicle and the story of two Franciscan martyrs first recorded in the Chronica XXIV Generalium, a Franciscan chronicle written around 1370, and repeated in Memoriale Ordinis Fratrum Minorum by Jan Komorowski. According to Chronica, two Czech friars, Ulrich and Martin, were murdered by Grand Duke Gediminas probably around 1341. One was tortured and murdered, another was tossed into the river to \\"float back to where he came from\\". Chodynicki concluded that the story in the Bychowiec Chronicle is nothing more than a fanciful embellishment of the story in Chronica and this conclusion was widely accepted. The story from Chronica is accepted by historians as authentic as the chronicle was produced within living memory of the events. Viktoras Gidžiūnas was the first to note that De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco, finished in 1390 by Bartholomew Rinonico and published in 1513 in Milan, contains a story of five Franciscans murdered in Vilnius. The laconic description notes that four friars were cut with swords while the guardian (head of the friary) had his hands, feet, and head partially cut off. Still alive, he was then put into a little boat; he drifted via the Neris and Neman to the territory of the Teutonic Knights. The same note mentioned two friars killed by the \\"same idolaters\\" in Siret, Moldavia, in 1378. English historian S. C. Rowell noted that the story in De Conformitate Vitae would fit in the context of a Lithuanian raid, possibly to avenge the murder of Yuri Koriatovich, into Moldavia in 1377. Additionally, Franciscan Andrzej Jastrzębiec was the first bishop of both Siret and Vilnius and thus could have provided his first-hand knowledge of both events. Therefore, Rowell concluded that De Conformitate Vitae proved that the event in the Bychowiec Chronicle did occur. The martyrdom in Vilnius is not dated in De Conformitate Vitae, but Marianus of Florence provided the date of 1369, which would fit perfectly with Bychowiec's note that the martyrs were murdered while Algirdas was at war with Moscow. Darius Baronas agreed with Rowell that the event did occur, but clarified that the author of the Bychowiec Chronicle did not know about either Chronica or De Conformitate Vitae as there are no textual similarities between the works. He concluded that the story in the Bychowiec Chronicle stems from a real historical event that embellished with various fictional elements that served political needs of the chronicle's sponsors. Political agenda Overall, the chronicle highlights achievements of the Goštautai and Olshanski families, particularly of Jonas Goštautas. Therefore, scholars concluded that it was sponsored by a member of these families. Scholars proposed Grand Chancellor Albertas Goštautas, Bishop Paweł Holszański, and Duke Olelkovich. It is evident that the legend in the Bychowiec Chronicle had a clear political agenda to glorify the Goštautai family. In the chronicle, Goštautas is presented as a hero of the Christian faith: he is the first to marry a Polish lady and convert to Christianity, he is the first to bring Christian missionaries to Lithuania and build them a friary. All of these feats preceded Jogaila's marriage to Jadwiga of Poland in 1386 and official conversion in 1387 by two decades. In a way, according to the chronicle, Jogaila only continued the work started by Goštautas. The chronicle also serves to increase prestige of Lithuanian Franciscans: it diminishes the role of the Poles in the christianization of Lithuania. The chronicle also mentions that the first Bishop of Vilnius was a friar from a local Franciscan friary founded by Goštautas. While historically incorrect (the first bishop was Andrzej Jastrzębiec, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Gniezno), it serves a clear political agenda to demonstrate independence of Lithuanian Franciscans. It aligns well with the efforts of Albertas Goštautas to separate Franciscans in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the Franciscan Province of Poland. He succeeded in 1530, which is around the time that the Bychowiec Chronicle was produced. Religious symbolism Baronas analyzed the legend looking for religious symbolism. He identified some parallels between Saint Peter and Petras Goštautas, the Seven Deacons and the fourteen martyrs. Other allusions could be the Fourteen Holy Helpers or the seven martyrs in 2 Maccabees 7:1-42. An interesting parallel was drawn by Antoni Grzybowski in 1740: he compared seven priests who destroyed the walls of Jericho with trumpets of ram's horn in Joshua 6: 1-21 with the Franciscan priests who silenced the howling devil (i.e. the Iron Wolf) with the Good News of God.

A part of the club's five consecutive Campeonato Pernambucano titles, he also became team captain in the process. In 1976 Givanildo moved to Corinthians, but was sparingly used and subsequently returned to Santa in the following year. In 1980, after a short stint at Fluminense, he joined state rivals Sport, eventually retiring with the club in 1983 at nearly 35 years of age. International Givanildo represented Brazil on 13 occasions (six of them official), with his debut occurring on 31 May 1976 in a 4–1 routing of Italy for the 1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament. Managerial career Givanildo's first managerial job came on 1983 at Sport, immediately after retiring. His first accolade as a manager occurred in 1986, as he won the Campeonato Alagoano with CRB. In 1987, while in charge of Paysandu, Givanildo won the year's Campeonato Paraense, and subsequently returned to his first club Santa Cruz in 1989. He left the club in the following year, and was subsequently in charge of CSA (two stints), Paysandu, Sport (three stints), Central, Ponte Preta (two stints), Remo, Bragantino, CRB, Náutico (two stints), Guarani, Bahia and América Mineiro; with the latter he achieved promotion to the Série A in 1997. In 1998, Givanildo rejoined Santa after leaving América, and went back to Paysandu in April 2000, leading the latter club to the top tier in 2001 and winning the 2002 Copa dos Campeões, which qualified his side to the 2003 Copa Libertadores. He resigned in September 2002, and subsequently took over Náutico. In April 2003, Givanildo was named manager of Remo, and left the club in December. For the 2004 season, he was named manager five times in four clubs; starting with Paysandu, he only lasted one month before turning out to Fortaleza. He eventually returned to Papão in April, being dismissed in August and taking over Remo, but finished the campaign in charge of Santa Cruz. Givanildo remained in charge of Santa Cruz until April 2006, when he resigned to take over Atlético Paranaense. Dismissed in July, he led Sport to the second place of the Série B. In 2007, Givanildo had unassuming spells at Santa Cruz, Vitória and Brasiliense; at the latter, he was in charge for just three matches, all defeats. He returned to Paysandu for the 2008 season, but stepped down and took over Vila Nova in April, staying at the club until the following February. On 17 March 2009, Givanildo was appointed manager of Mogi Mirim, but moved to América Mineiro the following month. On 10 November, after winning the Série C with the latter, he took over Sport. On 19 July 2010, Givanildo returned to Santa. In September he resigned, and took over Ponte Preta on 25 October. On 18 May 2011, Givanildo rejoined Remo for a fourth spell. On 1 August he returned to América Mineiro, and subsequently took over Paysandu (two stints), ABC and Treze before rejoining the club on 17 September 2014. On 3 June 2016, Givanildo was sacked by América. On 5 September, he took over Náutico, but was dismissed on 2 December after failing to achieve promotion. On 17 February 2017, Givanildo was announced at Ceará. On 2 July he returned to Santa Cruz for a sixth spell, but was relieved from his duties on 27 August. On 27 February 2018, Givanildo rejoined Remo. Sacked on 27 May, he took over América Mineiro for the fifth time on 11 November.

The Ofpe/WN9 type remains even though other stars of this type have been reclassified to types between WN9 and WN11. R99 has significant differences from those other stars which preclude it being given a simple WN spectral type: the ultraviolet spectrum is strongly blanketed over a different range of wavelengths; highly ionised iron lines are seen in absorption instead of emission; the H lines are unusually narrow and have no P Cygni profile; a lack of any significant absorption features near Hδ; a number of metal lines are unusually strong or weak compared to other stars of the type; there is a small unexplained infrared excess. The wind structure of R99 may be significantly different from most WR stars and LBVs. The normal temperature-stratified WR wind is accelerated to terminal velocity, causing lines of different ionisation levels of Helium to be created at different distances from the star. This does not seem to apply to R99. Significant polarisation of the spectrum continuum is also seen, suggesting an asymmetric wind. This has not been observed in other WR stars. R99 shows brightness variations of about 0.3 magnitude over a period of decades, and smaller amplitudes with the strongest periods at two and ten days. The colour also varies, with the star being bluer at minimum light.

A botanical drug is defined in the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as a botanical product that is marketed as diagnosing, mitigating, treating, or curing a disease; a botanical product in turn, is a finished, labeled product that contains ingredients from plants. Chemicals that are purified from plants, like paclitaxel, and highly purified products of industrial fermentation, like biopharmaceuticals, are not considered to be botanical products. In 2006 the Food and Drug Administration approved the first botanical drug in the United States: sinecatechins, a green tea extract for genital warts. Definition A botanical drug product is defined in the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C;) as a botanical drug that is marketed as diagnosing, mitigating, treating, or curing a disease; a botanical product in turn, is a finished, labeled product that contains vegetable matter as ingredients.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). June 2004. Guidance for Industry: Botanical Drug Products Chemicals that are purified from plants, like paclitaxel or artemisinin, and highly purified products of industrial fermentation, like biopharmaceuticals, are not considered to be botanical products. The FD&C; act separately regulates uses of botanical products as food (including dietary supplements), medical devices (e.g., gutta-percha), and cosmetics. Regulation Like other drugs, botanical drugs may be sold over the counter (OTC) or by prescription only. For OTC drugs, a monograph must be created by the company that wants to market the drug and then approved by the FDA, after which it is published in the Federal Register. For prescription drugs, a New Drug Application (NDA) must be filed with and approved by the FDA; clinical data included in the NDA is gathered under an Investigational New Drug Application which the FDA also must approve before clinical testing begins. Assessment of the safety and toxicity of botanical drugs in clinical trials, and in ensuring their quality once the drug is on the market, is complicated by the nature of the raw ingredients; problems arise in identifying the correct plants to harvest, in the quality of plants harvested, in their processing, and in the stability of the active components, which are often poorly understood. The FDA relies on a combination of tests and controls to ensure the identity and quality of botanical drugs. The tests include \\"fingerprinting\\" using spectroscopy or chromatography, chemical or biological assays, and process controls on raw material collection and processing. The standards are higher for botanical drugs than for extracts or plant matter used in dietary supplements. If the substance being developed as a botanical drug has been used in traditional medicine, it may be possible to begin initial, small clinical trials without conducting extensive toxicology testing. However, toxicity testing is required before beginning larger clinical trials and trials that will be used to get approval to sell a botanical drug. The endogenous Chinese pharmaceutical industry is made up mostly of companies that make herbal traditional chinese medicines and sell them over the counter; the US regulatory pathway is similar to that established by the China Food and Drug Administration.Deloitte, 2011 The next phase:Opportunities in China's pharmaceuticals market The European regulatory pathway is also similar.

He was known as a strict disciplinarian and during a visitation of Igny Abbey, a daughter house of Clairvaux, was murdered by a monk named Hugh of Bazoches, whom he had threatened with disciplinary punishment.Thomas Füser: Mönche im Konflikt, Münster 2000, p. 136 (digitised version at Google books )  Veneration  The most important source for Gerard's life and death is the Exordium magnum Ordinis Cisterciensis by Konrad of Eberbach, written some decades after the events in Clairvaux. It already portrays Gerard as a martyr, recounting that Petrus Monoculus, who was the abbot of Igny at the time of the murder and from 1179 Gerard's next successor but one at Clairvaux, had a vision of him during the funeral mass together with Saint Bernard in the light of heaven.The vision is given at trappistevitorchiano.it . His liturgical veneration in the Cistercian Order was first permitted however by Pope Clement XI in 1702. His feast day is 8 March.

As a state defense force, the Rhode Island State Guard served as a state military unit which assumed the stateside duties of the Rhode Island National Guard when the National Guard was in federal service. However, unlike the National Guard, the State Guard, when organized, answers solely to the Governor of Rhode Island and by law cannot be federalized or deployed outside the borders of Rhode Island. History History of predecessor units Prior to the creation of the National Guard of the United States, the United States maintained a small professional army which, in times of war, would be supplemented by volunteer militia units raised by individual states. During the American Revolutionary War, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment was raised to serve in the Continental Army. Rhode Island raised multiple units to fight for the Union Army during the American Civil War. During the Spanish–American War, the 1st Regiment, Rhode Island Volunteers, was mustered into federal service but did not see combat. World War I The Militia Act of 1903 federalized state militias and placed them under federal control. When the National Guard was deployed abroad during World War I, states were forced to raise replacement units to provide homeland security capabilities. During World War I, Rhode Island raised 18 companies of State Guard, composed of 100 men each, and established a headquarters and supply company, a machine-gun detachment and a sanitary detachment. In order to equip the State Guard, the state purchased .38 revolvers from private dealers, and obtained five hundred .45 caliber Springfield rifles and two hundred fifty .30 caliber Krag–Jørgensen rifles from the federal government. The state also possessed an additional six hundred .45 caliber Springfield rifles. World War II The State Guard was reactivated in 1940, reaching the size of one regiment. The Rhode Island State Guard reached a strength of over 1,300 men during the war. Rhode Island also formed the Rhode Island State Guard Reserve during the war. Korean War On the onset of the Korean War, several states, including Rhode Island, reactivated their state defense forces at cadre strength as a safeguard against the possibility of their National Guard units being federalized. Cold War The Rhode Island State Guard was reactivated in 1987 and renamed the Rhode Island State Defense Force. By 1990, it consisted of only three members. Legal status State defense forces are given legal recognition by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. The authority to maintain independent chartered military organizations separate of the National Guard is recognized under Rhode Island Law. Chapter 30-5, section 30-5-5 of the Rhode Island General Laws allows the Governor of Rhode Island to call and organize portions of the unorganized militia whenever he or she deems it necessary, and requires him or her to do so when the Rhode Island National Guard is in federal service. Legal protection Under Rhode Island law, no employer may fire an employee due to the employee's membership in the Rhode Island State Guard, or due to their obligation to perform military service, or attempt to hinder their ability to perform military service. Nor may employers threaten or otherwise insinuate that an employee will suffer repercussions from the employer as a result of his or her service with the Rhode Island State Guard. Any employer or agent of an employer who is guilty of these offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor offense.

Since 1965 the complex has performed the function of a cultural centre, including fine arts. The palace houses a museum and an exhibition space. History The Neo-Gothic Radziejowice Castle Manor House in the Radziejowice Castle Complex The location of the palace was already the site of a residence for the Radziejowski family in the 15th century. During the 17th century, the palace, after various expansions and modernisations, took on the Gothic architectural style, as did the other buildings in the complex. During the complex's greatest time of magnificence, the palace was a residence to various Kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth: Zygmund III Waza, Władysław IV and Jan III Sobieski. The current look of the complex comes from the turning point of the 18th and 19th centuries, after Kazimierz Krasiński's reconstruction of the complex, designed and by Jakub Kubicki. The expansion of the complex was later continued by Józef Wawrzyniec Krasiński, who had built the surrounding landscape park and the small Neo-Gothic castle. During the next decades, the Radziejowski family was visited by people of culture such as Juliusz Kossak, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Lucjan Rydel, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, Józef Chełmoński and Stanisław Masłowski. The castle and complex were devastated during World War II, but the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage has thoroughly restored the site to its former beauty. Currently, the castle and the complex are visited by writers, columnists, actors, film-makers, musicians and visual artists. Among notable visitors was Jerzy Waldorff.

For centuries it was one of the entry points into Naples from the South, but was obliterated during the late 19th-century urban renewal of the city. Guglielmo Pepe on the Ponte della Maddalena Prior to Norman times, the bridge was known as pons padulis. Then it was named Guizzardo bridge, for a bridge built by Robert Guiscard, Duke of Puglia, when he lay siege to the city in 1078. It stood near the shoreline to the east of the city where the Via Marinella crossed the River Sebeto (within the present-day Vittorio Emanuele III docks and Piazza Mercato). The bridge was rebuilt in 1555 under the Viceroy Don Bernardino di Mendoza, to span the marsh ground where the Sebeto river arose during the rainy season.Ponte della Maddalena a Napoli di urbanistica a napoli Lupo Gissi mimmo cantarella e daniele casagrande - 21 febbraio, 2013. The bridge was rebuilt again in 1747 under Charles III and once again in the second half of the 19th century. No longer in existence, it was an established and popular vantage point for topographical artists.JMW Turner, view of Ponto della Maddalena. The bridge was an excellent point at which to deny entry to invading forces into the city. The most famous of these was the stand in 1799 of the forces of the short-lived Neapolitan republic against the returning royalist Bourbon army. The Miracle of the Magdalene bridge recalls an incident in December 1631, when the cardinal of Naples, led a procession dedicated to San Gennaro to the bridge to plead for the end to an eruption of Vesuvius. The ebbing of the eruption was interpreted as a miraculous intercession.

She has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church. Life She was born Benedetta Rossello in Albissola Marina in 1811, the fourth of the ten children of Bartolomeo Rossello and Maria Dedone. As a child she assisted her parents with their work and took care of her siblings. Rossello was devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary and followed her religious vocation. This led her to becoming a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis at the age of sixteen. Benedetta would become the sole person of support for her household after the death of her mother and second brother as well as her sister Josephine and her father after this. In 1837 Rosello responded to Agostino De Mari and his appeal for volunteers in education and she worked with the poor and uneducated. De Mari provided a small house to Rossello and her coworkers and it resulted in - on 10 August 1837 - the foundation of the Conservatory of the Sisters of Mercy and Saint John the Baptist. She had the task of Mistress of Novices and was also the treasurer of the institute. On 22 October 1837 Rossello began a formal novitiate and was given the religious name of Maria Giuseppa, while the new religious institute was officially titled the Daughters of Our Lady of Mercy, with the aim of bringing the mercy of God into the world. The institute worked with the poor and the sick, lending their services in parishes, hospitals and schools. Rossello was later made Superior General of the order in 1840, filling that office for forty years. On 14 December 1840, their benefactor and collaborator De Mari died, already having prepared a draft of the Rule of Life of the institute. Plagued with heart complications due to the strenuous work she undertook, Rossello died at the age of 69 on 7 December 1880. Buried in the local cemetery in Savona, she was re-interred into the motherhouse chapel in 1887. Official approval for the order was given by Pope Pius X in a decree on 12 January 1904. Sainthood The cause of sainthood for Rossello commenced on 23 July 1927 on a local level in Savona, granting her the title of Servant of God. This local process culminated on 19 March 1936 when Pope Pius XI recognized her life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable. The recognition of two miracles led to her beatification on 6 November 1938 and the approval of two other miracles led to her canonization on 12 June 1949 by Pope Pius XII.

It was released on September 2, 2014, via Casablancas' indie record label Cult Records as the first single from their debut album Tyranny. The song is nearly eleven minutes long. Origin and composition The inception of the song began with drummer Alex Carapetis bringing a sample of Mozart's Requiem in D Minor to Casablancas attention and was used as a starting base to the song. The initial lyrics of the song \\"Put money in my hand and I will do the things you want me to\\" allude to Tyranny's themes of greed and corruption while the rest of the song examines Casablancas' relationship with his estranged father John Casablancas who died in 2013 from cancer. Reception \\"Human Sadness\\" has been described very positive by critics, some describing it as \\"a structure-less beast that features everything from jarring noise and warped, processed vocals to bombastic stadium rock solos and a hint of the gritty NYC punk Casablancas is best known for.\\" It has also been compared to the Sufjan Stevens album The Age of Adz. Music video The music video for Human Sadness was released on May 27, 2015. The video was co-directed by Warren Fu, Nicholaus Goossen, and Wissa. The story of the video was conceived by Casablancas, Fu, and bassist Jake Bercovici and explores several storylines of human sorrow and anguish, portrayed by each member of the band juxtaposed against footage of the band playing as the apocalypse occurs on Earth. The video was inspired by the story of \\"the band that played on\\" on the Titanic as the ship sank. The end credits feature the demo of Human Sadness that Casablancas composed for the 2012 short film \\"The Unseen Beauty\\", a profile on Casablancas' step-father and artistic mentor Sam Adoquei. The music video took over a year to complete.

Career Billings, a defender recruited from Rose of Northcote, was already 26 when he debuted for Fitzroy in the 1905 VFL season. Fitzroy were the reigning VFL premiers, but Billings broke into the side in the opening round and played 13 games in the home and away season. He didn't take part in the 1905 finals series, which ended with Fitzroy claiming another premiership. In the 1906 season, Billings played only the first seven rounds, but in the 1907 season he was a regular in the team, with 12 appearances. Often used as a full-back, Billings was said to be noted for his \\"brilliant high marking\\" In 1908 he got a permit to return to Rose of Northcote. By this time he was also playing district cricket for the Northcote Cricket Club and in 1911-12 was a member of the club's first-grade premiership side. As a footballer he went on to play for Northcote in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), later Northcote-Preston as a result of a merger. He was cleared to the Williamstown Football Club in 1912. Personal life and death Billings died in a car accident at Morang on the night of 5 June 1915, aged 36. He was a passenger in the car, which had to swerve into an embankment to avoid colliding with a wood dray. The back tire burst and the occupants were tossed out of the vehicle. Billings appeared relatively unharmed, as he was able to go over and assist his companions in moving the car, but after giving it a lift lost consciousness. It was likely that he had suffered heart failure. He was married to Luisa Billings, with whom he had two children, Charlie and Bessie. A concert was held at Northcote Town Hall to raise money for his family.

It was incorporated in 1928 by Mavis McIntosh and Elizabeth Otis. The agency handles literary estates and subsidiary rights for the authors that it represents. History Mavis McIntosh (1906-1986) and Elizabeth Otis founded McIntosh & Otis in the mid 1920s, after they quit the literary agency at which they were working because they were dissatisfied with its practices. In 1928, they incorporated the firm, and by the early 1930s, it was a reputable and successful literary agency. In 1963, McIntosh & Otis merged with New-York based agency Constance Smith Associates. Patricia Schartle Myrer, who was a partner at Constance Smith Associates, became President of McIntosh & Otis. In the 1970s, McIntosh & Otis hired Eugene Winick, a copyright attorney, as outside counsel to represent the literary estates of authors represented by McIntosh & Otis, such as Mary Higgins Clark, Harper Lee, Sinclair Lewis, Ayn Rand, and Thomas Wolfe. In 1984, Patricia Schartle Myrer retired and appointed Eugene Winick as President of McIntosh & Otis. In 2001, Samuel Pinkus, a literary agent at McIntosh & Otis and Eugene Winick's son-in-law, took over as President of the agency but left in 2004. Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein, Eugene Winick's daughter, is currently the President of McIntosh & Otis. Authors represented   John Steinbeck  In 1931, John Steinbeck sent McIntosh & Otis a number of his early manuscripts based on the recommendation of Carl Wilhelmson. McIntosh & Otis gave Steinbeck positive encouragement, and he stuck with the firm as his only literary agency for the rest of his career, spanning nearly 40 years. In 1952, McIntosh & Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel East of Eden (1952) to Warner Brothers, which adapted it as a 1955 movie starring James Dean. Steinbeck received $125,000 for the film rights, plus 25 percent of the profits. When Steinbeck won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature, he gave McIntosh & Otis a percentage of the award money out of gratitude for their support. In 2004, McIntosh & Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel East of Eden to Universal Pictures, after the book was chosen for Oprah's Book Club list. The option expired, and Universal had to once again obtain the film rights. A forthcoming two-film series, starring Jennifer Lawrence, was scheduled for production as of April 2014.  Patricia Highsmith  Patricia Highsmith appointed Patricia Schartle Myrer as her literary agent in 1959, when Myrer was with Constance Smith Associates. After Constance Smith Associates merged with McIntosh & Otis in 1963, Myrer continued as Patricia Highsmith's American literary agent. A. M. Heath served as Patricia Highsmith's British agents. Over time, Patricia Highsmith came to resent the 5% commission each literary agency took, and Myrer fired Highsmith in 1979. Literary agents Subsidiary rights McIntosh & Otis handles the subsidiary rights for Louisiana University Press. Controversies In 2004, the family of John Steinbeck sued McIntosh & Otis for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and double- dipping commissions. In their attempt to fire the agency, a New York judge opined that they could not fire the agents based upon a power of attorney the family had signed in 1983. The judge then said that the power of attorney survived the death of the step-mother, Elaine Steinbeck and passed to her heirs by will. In a power grab, the agents failed to tell the court that Elaine had returned the power of attorney to John's only living son during her lifetime. Elaine's heirs were required to assign their power of attorney to the agents in order to inherit. The case was decided in a summary judgement motion without evidence production or witnesses. The situation remains contentious.\\"Steinbeck v. McIntosh & Otis\\", Case No. 1:04-cv-05497-GBD In June 2013, McIntosh & Otis filed a lawsuit against a literary agent formerly employed with them, Samuel Pinkus, in relation with another lawsuit that was filed against him by author Harper Lee, who claimed that Pinkus had duped her into handing over her copyright for her novel To Kill A Mockingbird. McIntosh & Otis claimed a percentage of commissions Pinkus earned from clients he took with him when he left the company in 2004 but eventually settled the lawsuit in September 2013.

Energy quantities may also be labelled as power quantities in this context.ISO 80000:1-2009 § C.3 A root-power quantity is a quantity such as voltage, current, sound pressure, electric field strength, speed, or charge density, the square of which, in linear systems, is proportional to power. The term root-power quantity was introduced in the ; it replaces and deprecates the term field quantity. Implications It is essential to know which category a measurement belongs to when using decibels (dB) for comparing the levels of such quantities. A change of one bel in the level corresponds to a 10× change in power, so when comparing power quantities x and y, the difference is defined to be 10×log10(y/x) decibel. With root-power quantities, however the difference is defined as 20×log10(y/x) dB. In linear systems, these definitions allow the distinction between root-power quantities and power quantities to be ignored when specifying changes as levels: an amplifier can be described as having \\"3 dB\\" of gain without needing to specify whether voltage or power are being compared; for a given linear load (e.g. an speaker), such an increase will result in a 3 dB increase in both the sound pressure level and the sound power level at a given location near the speaker. Conversely, when ratios cannot be identified as either power or root-power quantities, the units neper (Np) and decibel (dB) cannot be sensibly used. In the analysis of signals and systems using sinusoids, field quantities and root-power quantities may be complex-valued.ISO 80000-1:2009 § C.2ISO 80000-3:2006 § 0.5IEC 60027-3:2002 \\"Root-power quantity\\" vs. \\"field quantity\\" In justifying the deprecation of the term \\"field quantity\\" and instead using \\"root-power quantity\\" in the context of levels, ISO 80000 draws attention to the conflicting use of the former term to mean a quantity that depends on the position,ISO 80000-1:2009 § C.2 which in physics is called a field.

It was one of the earliest restaurant chain franchises in the United States. Chicken in the Rough was founded by Beverly and Rubye Osborne in 1936 in Oklahoma City, and the restaurant's specialty half a fried chicken dish was also created in 1936. The dish itself was also referred to as \\"Chicken in the Rough\\", and consisted of half a fried chicken, shoestring potatoes and a biscuit with honey. Three restaurants presently serve the dish today, located in Oklahoma City, Port Huron, Michigan and Canadian neighbor Sarnia, Ontario.http://www.thetimesherald.com/story/news/local/port- huron/2017/03/01/palms-krystal-bar-changing-ownership/98584004/ The chain's logo was an image of a rooster smoking a cigar and carrying a golf club. The chain also used a logo of \\"Chicken's Caddie\\", which depicted a chick acting as a golf caddie, stating \\"I'll gladly be fried for Chicken in the Rough\\". History The restaurant's name was devised on a cancelled 1936 road trip to California, in which Beverly spilled a picnic basket of chicken after Rubye hit a bump in the road while driving on the Oklahoma prairie. Rubye remarked something to the effect of \\"This is really chicken in the rough\\". After this occurred, they turned around and headed back to Oklahoma City. Another notion is that the name was devised on a family picnic \\"where silverware had been forgotten\\", and that the consumption of the chicken without silverware constituted eating it \\"in the rough\\", using one's hands. However, the official website of the chain states that the former occurred. Beverly's Pancake Corner in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, now called Beverly's Pancake House, has been described as the \\"home base\\" of Chicken in the Rough. Three additional restaurant locations presently serve the dish. The half-chicken dish continued to be served at Beverly's Pancake House, where it's prepared according to its original recipe. The first standalone Chicken in the Rough restaurant was opened on U.S. Route 66 at 2429 North Lincoln in 1936, and was initially a small drive-in restaurant with nine stools and four booths. The restaurant was significantly expanded to seat 1,100 people, and became a place that was visited by travelers, film stars and state executives. Celebrities who were friends with the Osbornes and patrons of Beverly's Pancake Corner restaurants include Bob Hope and Gene Autry. Beverly's Pancake House has a framed black- and-white photo on a wall showing Hope with a birthday cake that the restaurant made him one year. In 1961, the building was demolished, and the state capitol complex was then constructed there. Expansion Chicken in the Rough was the first nationally franchised restaurant chain in the United States. In 1937, the chain had locations on Route 66 in the U.S. states of Arizona, Oklahoma, Missouri and Illinois. In 1949, an extraordinary grill was designed that simultaneously fried and steamed chicken, after which time franchising began. During its heyday, the chain had seven locations in Oklahoma City and nearly 300 franchise locations, including franchises in South Africa and Hawaii. In the 1960s, after the franchise was sold to an investor group, 68 franchises remained. In 1974 Osborne's partner, Randy Shaw, purchased the restaurant chain. Today Three restaurants continue to serve the dish: two restaurants in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada and one in Port Huron, Michigan. The dish is presently prepared with a unique breading and preparation method, and cooked in a deep fryer. Patrons of Beverly's Pancake Corner from the times of their youth continue to eat at the restaurant, which has included some who remember the first day it opened. When the Beverly's Pancake Corner location at Northwest Expressway and Pennsylvania in Oklahoma City, where it existed since 1956, was razed in 2008, people took pieces of concrete and bricks from the building as mementos.

The strike officially began on February 18, 1917 (according to the Julian calendar; March 2 on the Gregorian calendar) and quickly snowballed, sparking larger demonstrations in Petrograd. There were several strikes involving the workers of the Putilov Mill over the years with the first one taking place in 1905, yet this particular strike in 1917 is considered the catalyst which sparked the February Revolution. Background World War I had taken its toll on Russia, leading to a decline in the morale of the citizens as well as distrust in the government. Russia, having the largest of all the armies fighting in the war, sent its soldiers to the front ill-prepared. There were armament shortages which forced the soldiers to use the weapons of their fallen comrades which had been killed and some of the soldiers even had to fight bare-foot. The decaying bodies brought about sickness and disease, further infuriating the soldiers. The Tsarist regime had prepared for a war which they believed would only last six months and one they believed they would win virtually untouched. As a result of this ill preparation, the Russian economy suffered greatly and the citizens of Russia began to experience food and necessary goods shortages as well. Petrograd was especially devastated because it was not located near any agriculturally-rich areas and was receiving only one third of its fuel and goods despite its massive population. The prices of food nearly quadrupled and despite this, worker wages remained as they were prior to World War I. The soldiers, workers and peasants were now in severe distress, causing workers to demand higher wages. The Strike On February 18, 1917, workers at the Putilov Mill in Petrograd demanded higher wages because of the rising prices of food and goods. When the disgruntled workers began to dispute with the authorities at the mill over the denial of their pay increase, some 20,000 workers were locked out sparking an outrage among other factories in Petrograd. By February 22, in retaliation of the lockout, over 100,000 workers were actively protesting. The next day, on International Women’s Day, women joined the strikes and protests, demanding equal rights as well as others strikers protesting the rationing of bread. By this time, well over 500,000 people were protesting Petrograd for several different reasons. General Khabalov, as ordered by the Tsar, was told to order the troops to fire onto the crowds of protestors, but the soldiers refused. The soldiers instead sided with and joined the protestors as a result of their harsh treatment during and after the war. As more and more citizens joined the strikes, they became more about economics and politics. The protestors began to express their opposition of the Tsarist regime as well as the war. The majority of the businesses in Petrograd had been closed, ceasing mobilization and daily operations within the city. The strikes, though spontaneous and popular among the citizens, came to a halt on March 4. This series of economic and political strikes lasting from February 22 until March 4, 1917, became known as the February Revolution. Outcomes While the city of Petrograd was in disarray, Tsar Nicholas II, was absent from the city and ignorant to the unrest happening there. Upon attempting to return to the city, he realized the severity of what was actually happening, understanding that he was the target of the opposition. He decided to go into hiding, refusing to communicate with anyone. His regime began to disband as its officials began to abandon their positions as well. The Duma advised Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate his throne. He eventually attempted to return to Petrograd, thinking that he would be welcomed, however his train was diverted and it was then that he realized his regime was dismantled. He was again advised to abdicate his throne, which he did. He offered it to Grand Duke Michael, however realizing the magnitude of the disturbances in Petrograd, he refused the throne. The strikes eventually began to ease on March 3 when twelve former members of the Duma formed the Provisional Government led by Prince Georgy Lvov. Several groups such as factory committees formed and many businesses in Petrograd began to have daily meetings. Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies which represented the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Petrograd eventually introduced the eight-hour work day. 1.

The largest system really depended on whether or not track in depots was counted. In 1900, there were three private companies operating of double track routes radiating out from the downtown area. State of the art technology when the first line opened in 1882, by 1900 electric traction had proven superior and in 1906 all cable routes were changed to electrical power. In 2015 most were part of Chicago Transit Authority bus routes. History In the 1850s Chicago was growing rapidly and local transportation was a problem. Flat and low, drainage was poor and the roads were often muddy and near impassible for foot and horse traffic. In 1859 the Illinois state legislature incorporated the Chicago City Railway (CCR) and the North Chicago Street Railroad (NCSR), to provide rail horsecar service in Chicago. In 1861 the Chicago West Division Railway was incorporated. The three companies served different parts of the city, defined by the Chicago River, and were not in competition with each other. By 1880 all three had main routes with feeder lines. In 1882 the CCR opened cable lines to the south on State St. and Wabash-Cottage Grove Ave. Immediately successful, the State St. line would be extended to 63rd St. by 1887 and the Cottage Grove Ave. line to 71st St. by 1890. In 1886 the NCSR put a cable line on Clark St. and parallel 5th Ave. (now Wells St.) into service. In 1889 a branch on Lincoln Ave. opened, and the last branch, on Clybourn Ave., opened in 1891. In 1890 the re- organized West Chicago Street Railroad (WCSR) opened their first lines, to the northwest on Milwaukee Ave. Shortly afterwards a line straight west on Madison Ave. opened. In 1893 two more routes would open, southwest on Blue Island Ave and south on Halsted St. In 1892 the Chicago City Council allowed the CCR to electrify three horse lines outside of downtown, two years later many North and West lines were electrified. In 1896 the first downtown electrification was permitted, in 1906 all cable service was converted to electric traction. Operations CCR train northbound on State St. (Grip and trailer pulling electric car) The cable cars did not suffer much from the elements, and the harsher winters of the US Midwest and East Coast were no problem for them. As with some other cities using cable cars the problem in generally flat Chicago was not one of grades, but of traffic volume due to the density of the city. As in other cities the cable cars did not completely replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to trolleys, the electrical cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown, due to the lack of trolley wires there. Rolling stock Combination grip car The passenger numbers caused a different approach than many other cities. Some single cars were used, but on most lines grip cars pulled trains of up to three trailers (reduced to two by law in the 1890s). Most grip cars were short and open. Four different types of grips were used, one by each company and the WCSR's south and southwest lines using a fourth. CCR used a grip that could grip either side of the cable, allowing the grip car to operate in either direction. NCSR and WCSR grip cars could operate in one direction only. None of the grips could be used on other lines. Approximately 700 grip cars were in service. Both the NCSR and WCSR operated large combination grip cars, with an open front and closed back sections. These cars also could pull trailers. Trailers started as short two axle cars similar to horsecars, and were built by the operator. Later, longer two truck cars would be built by vendors. Open summer and closed winter cars were used, with two car trains the norm, there were between two and four trailers for each grip. Loops Switching directions on a cable train can be very difficult. Each track can go in one direction only, and the grip car has to be at the head of the train. Turning around a loop was common, at the end of most lines there were loops. In the downtown area the loops went around several blocks, increasing the area the line would otherwise serve. Equipment and operating differences prevented common track use between most routes, in 1900 there were six separate loops in use. Tunnels The Chicago River separates the downtown from the North and West sides. Heavy river traffic required moveable bridges, and long delays. Cable cannot be used on moveable bridges, and the delays would have stopped the whole system, so the NCCR leased and refurbished the city's LaSalle St. tunnel under the river, the WCCR would use the similar Washington St. tunnel for its first two lines. For the WCCR's two Southwest lines the company dug a tunnel next to Van Buren St. at their own expense. Powerhouses and cables All three companies used similar infrastructures, with large steam boilers and reciprocating engines driving long endless cables through conduits. At their peak there were 13 powerhouses driving 34 cables. Different cables could run at different speeds, the CCR's loop originally ran at (increased to in 1892) while outlying cables could operate at . Political corruption Throughout cable operations both politics and business were very corrupt in many cities, including Chicago. Some politicians expected not only political support but also bribes. Dummy companies were created to extort the operators, and property owners often conspired to sell their consent to the routes. The CCR, well managed and first in operation, was affected least, while the North and West companies, controlled by robber baron Charles Tyson Yerkes, were involved in some unscrupulous business practices. The end of cable service In 1900 the lowering of the river exposed the tops of all three tunnels, making them hazards to navigation. In 1906 all three tunnels under the river were closed for construction, cutting cable service to the North and West. This was when the changeover to electricity ordered by the Chicago City Council in 1905 occurred. The last cable powered train was on the CCR Cottage Grove Ave. line on October 21, 1906. The companies Chicago City Railway In 1900 the Chicago City Railway was the largest cable operator in the country. Incorporated on February 14, 1859, it was well managed and progressive from its beginning. In 1880 their president had inspected the successful San Francisco lines, and felt cable could be used in Chicago. In 1882 they opened the first cable lines outside of San Francisco. They then built lines past the built up areas, making land along the route more valuable. Development followed the lines, making more traffic. When first opened the State St. and Wabash - Cottage Grove Avenue lines both used a slow speed () three block loop. This could not handle the traffic, in 1892 the Cottage Grove Avenue line started using a new two block loop directly east of the original, which was rebuilt two years later. Trains of both lines ran opposite each other on Wabash Ave. Because CCR grip cars were bi-directional, trains could be reversed onto the opposite track, and did not need a loop. It also meant that a train could stop and return without going to the end of the line. The Cottage Grove line had runs reversing at 39th St. and at the end of the line. In 1887 the CCR carried 70,000 to 100,000 passengers a day on approximately 150 trains. By 1892, after both lines had been lengthened, 300 trains were scheduled daily. Three powerhouses pulled thirteen cables. In 1906 CCR electrified its State St. line on July 22, and the Wabash-Cottage Grove Ave. line on October 21, the last day of cable service in Chicago. On February 1, 1914, the CCR began operating as part of the Chicago Surface Lines (CSL). North Chicago Street Railroad The North Chicago Street Railroad was the smallest of the three companies. Incorporated in 1859 as the North Chicago Street Railway, a horse-car system, it was badly damaged by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Little improvement was done until 1885, when a Philadelphia syndicate controlled by Charles Tyson Yerkes reorganized it as the North Chicago Street Railroad. In 1886 it began converting to cable. All the NCSR's lines entered downtown through the LaSalle St. tunnel and used a six block loop. The Clybourn Ave. line was the only place where single combination cars were used. The end of that route at had a turntable, rather than the loops that the other lines used. The NCSR had up to 177 grip cars and many more trailers. Three powerhouses pulled 9 cables. On May 24, 1899, the NCSR and WCSR were combined into the Chicago Union Traction Co., which would go into receivership on April 22, 1903 and was bought by the Chicago Railway Co. (CR) on January 25, 1908. On February 1, 1914, the Chicago Railway Co. began operating as part of the Chicago Surface Lines. West Chicago Street Railroad The West Chicago Street Railroad was incorporated in 1861 as the Chicago West Division Railway, in 1885 the Chicago Passenger Railway opened as a competitor. In 1887 the two were combined and reorganized by Charles Tyson Yerkes as the West Chicago Street Railroad. This put the NCSR. and WCSR under the same ownership, it began cable service in 1890, the last of the three companies to do so. A northwest and west line used another tunnel under the river on Washington St. to get to a two block loop, a four block loop was later added. A south and southwest line terminated west of the river until the privately built Van Buren St. tunnel opened in 1894, an eight block loop was used. The northwest Milwaukee Ave. line used single combination cars, all other lines used short grip cars with trailers. The WCSR had 230 grip cars and several times many trailers. Six powerhouses pulled 12 cables. On May 24, 1899 the WCSR, like the NCSR, was combined into the CUT, which would be bought by the CR on January 25, 1908. On February 1, 1914, the CR began operating as part of the Chicago Surface Lines. Remnants A CCR station from 1893 at 5529 South Lake Park Avenue survives in 2015. It currently serves as the home of the Hyde Park Historical Society. A shop building from 1902 and streetcar barns from 1906 remained in service in 2014 at the Chicago Transit Authority's 77th St. and Vincennes Ave. yard. A NCSR powerhouse at LaSalle and Illinois Streets remained in 2012. A WCSR altered powerhouse at Jefferson and Washington Streets and a car barn on Blue Island Ave. near Western Avenue remained in 2016.

Originally a Mersey Beat act, they experimented musically in other genres including psychedelic rock and protopunk. Their individualized sound was personalized by their intricate vocal harmonies and exploratory lyrics. History Just Four Men In early 1963, after several name changes, Four Just Men settled in Manchester as they decided to become professional. At the time, the group was composed of Demetrius \\"Dee\\" Christopolus as lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, lead guitarist Johnny Murphy, drummer Larry Arendes, and bassist Pete Turner. The band became a popular attraction in Liverpool as they shifted through two lineup changes,Keith Shepherd replaced Pete Turner, then John Kelman replaced Johnny Murphy. They then toured with more prominent groups including The Rolling Stones, The Searchers and Del Shannon. Despite their initial success, the band was plagued by missed opportunities when they rejected \\"Trains and Boats and Planes\\", a later hit for The Dakotas, and had lawsuit threats against them over their name that prevented Four Just Men from continuing their television commitments. The lawsuits originated from another band with the same name, so from that point on the Four Just Men became Just Four Men. Still, the band signed a contract with EMI Records in 1964, and produced two singles, which were both recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Their debut single, \\"That's My Baby\\" was released on 27 November 1964, and the second one, \\"There's Not One Thing\\", was released on 5 February 1965. Both singles were positively received, but the release dates were in correlation with The Beatles' releases so sales were dwarfed in comparison. Just Four Men's recordings were centered around a heavy bass sound, an aspect they experimented upon when they became Wimple Winch. After being dropped from the label, the band continued to perform until early 1966, at which point they morphed into Wimple Winch. Wimple Winch The renamed band consisted of an altered lineup of Arendes, Christopolus, John Kelman on lead guitar and newcomer Barrie Ashall on bass guitar. The name change was brought about as a result of the band's addition of heavier and more psychedelic components into their music. Auditions for the bass player were intensive, and were met with several failures, with Keith Shepherd staying on until Barrie Ashall managed to stand out among the other candidates. Within a few gigs after returning to performing, the band encountered their future manager, Mike Carr. Carr was opening a club in Stockport called \\"The Sinking Ship\\", and proposed that Wimple Winch become the house band. They accepted, under the conditions that they were guaranteed one performance per week, use of the property for rehearsals, and living quarters. The club, along with the band, established itself when Wimple Winch opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience at the venue. An associate of Fontana Records watched Wimple Winch perform, and signed the group to record at Philips Studios in Stanhope Place in March 1966. Recording occurred over a few days as the band completed demos for their debut single. They choose \\"What's Been Done\\" as their first release. It received heavy local support and was listed as a \\"climber\\" by Radio London in April 1966, but still failed to chart. Before their next release, Kelman worked on side projects including on recordings with Wayne Fontana's backing group, The Opposition. For their second release, the band choose \\"Save My Soul\\", which incorporated a protopunk structure. The single was immensely popular locally upon its 17 June 1966 release, but was unsuccessful nationally. \\"Save My Soul\\" has been recognized as one of the more innovative tracks of the Mersey beat scene, and was later immortalized on the compilation album, Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964–1969. In between performing, Wimple Winch recorded in August and December 1966. Several tracks were finished, and the song, \\"Rumble on Mersey Square South\\", which was in the style of The Who, was released as the group's final single on 20 January 1967. Other demos from sessions remained unreleased, however they exhibited the band's continuing development in psychedelic rock, and incorporation of soul music. Back in Stockport, \\"The Sinking Ship\\" caught fire and destroyed the group's housing and equipment. As a result, Fontana Records decided to not resign Wimple Winch. The band continued to tour, and recorded more demos in a personal studio, but decided to disband in mid-1967. Kelman briefly reformed Just Four Men in the early seventies with a new lineup, but no additional recordings took place.

Created by Mike Baron and Erik Larsen, the character made his first appearance in The Punisher Vol. 2, #22 (August 1989). He is an enemy of the Punisher.  Publication history  Saracen was introduced in The Punisher Vol. 2, #22-23, and reappeared in The Punisher War Journal #25-27, as well as The Punisher Vol. 2, #47-48, and The Punisher War Journal #33. The character was then killed off in the one-shot comic book The Punisher: Empty Quarter, though a version of him from an alternate universe was later featured in Exiles Vol. 1, #99. Saracen received profiles in Marvel Encyclopedia #5, and Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1.  Fictional character biography  A globe-trotting mercenary and assassin whose actions, such as plundering cruise ships and blowing up airliners, have resulted in him being branded a terrorist, Saracen hails from an undisclosed Arabian country, and is said to be happily married. Saracen first encountered the Punisher when the two infiltrated the same \\"ninja training camp\\" being run by con artists in Kansas. When the camp employees begin murdering the students, having realized that there are saboteurs among them, Saracen and the Punisher work together to survive, with Saracen explaining that he had enrolled in the camp in order to discern who among its former students was responsible for poisoning of one of the leaders of the Free Armenian Army. After the camp's instructors are killed, the Punisher saves Saracen from an explosion that immolates the establishment's owner, Chester Scully. Saracen goes on to work for a corrupt Florida senator, who sends him to Palermo to assist the Bessucho crime family (which is led by the senator's cousin) with eliminating the Punisher. Saracen confronts the Punisher at a weapons cache owned by the Punisher's estranged relatives, Rocco and Esmerelda Castiglione. The two engage in a battle that ends with the Punisher blowing the area up, though Saracen survives, and murders Rocco and Esmerelda. Afterward, the Punisher frames Saracen for his own slaying of the corrupt senator, who was sponsoring Saracen for American citizenship. Saracen, operating under the name Colonel Hawk, subsequently allies with a Middle Eastern country called Trafia. When the Punisher is captured by the Trafian military, Saracen orders that he be executed in a way that will send a message to Trafia's enemies, such as the nation of Zukistan. The Punisher escapes and tries to kill Saracen, but he is forced to spare him by Microchip, who reveals that Saracen is actually working for and under the protection of the governments Zukistan and Israel. Saracen proceeds to travel to Siberia at the behest of a renegade Russian general who has taken over an oil refinery, and is seeking to secede from the Soviet Union. Hired to advise the general and supply him with wares, Saracen flees when the refinery is attacked by the Punisher. While dismantling a narcotics ring, the Punisher finds Saracen working for drug lords in Peru, and among his possessions discovers an invitation to a \\"terrorist convention\\" being held in Rub' al Khali. With the help of the Bolivian authorities, the Punisher is able to capture Saracen, and assume his identity in order to infiltrate Rub' al Khali. Saracen is broken out of imprisonment by his Peruvian associates, and travels to Rub' al Khali, arriving just as the Punisher and his ally, Rose Kugel, blow up the First World International Terrorist Convention. Saracen ambushes the two, and forces the Punisher into a sword fight; the duel concludes with the Punisher dismembering and impaling Saracen.  Other versions   Exiles  Saracen's counterpart on Earth-1009 is a superhero and a member of the Royal Avengers. He and his teammates, Iron Lord and American Boy, attempt to arrest their world's version of Rogue, but she is saved by the Exiles member Morph.

Homicide Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, November 2005, pp 271-291; DOI: 10.1177/1088767905280080 Their guilt was established in the late 1990s thanks to DNA profiling, after which both brothers were convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Early years Little is known about the brothers' childhood. What is known is that they were born in Mobile, Alabama, in a financially strained family with seven other children. After the family moved to Ohio, the father abandoned them. In Toledo, the family was forced to live in an urban area populated mainly by other African-Americans with low social status and education level, thanks to which the two brothers grew up in an impoverished and racially segregated environment. After one of their older brothers, Hayes Cook, was convicted in the mid-1960s for rape, Anthony dropped out of school and began spending more time on the streets among petty criminals. In 1974, he was arrested and convicted for robbery, spending the next several years in prison. After his release, Anthony stated that he was subjected to strong physical and psychological abuse by the prison guards and fellow inmates, most of whom were white, after which he began to show signs of racial hatred towards the white populus of the city. On the other hand, Nathaniel had no problems with the law, did not abuse alcohol or drugs, and worked as a driver, earning a high salary. After his brother's release from prison 1979, Anthony returned to Toledo and began spending more time with Nathaniel. As a result, the younger Cook was negatively influenced by his elder sibling, and soon after, a series of murders was unleashed upon the city. Murders The killings began in May 1980, when the brothers attacked 24-year-old Thomas Gordon and his 18-year-old girlfriend in northern Toledo. They threatened them with guns, seized control of their car and held them hostage. The Cooks drove the couple to the woodlands in Lucas County, where they shot Gordon and raped his girlfriend, after which they stabbed her and fled the crime scene. The girlfriend survived, but Gordon didn't. On January 3, 1981, Anthony and Nathaniel picked up a 19-year-old hitchhiker and Michigan native named Connie Sue Thompson, driving her out to Lucas County, where they raped and subsequently killed her. The criminals then threw the victim's body off a bridge into a stream where it was discovered on January 17th. In February of that year, Anthony, while returning from work, lured 12-year-old Dawn Rene Backes into his car. Soon, Nathaniel joined them, after which the two men took the victim to an abandoned theater, where they raped and tortured the young girl for the next several hours, much to their sadistic amusement, before finally hitting her several times on the head with a brick block, killing Dawn on the spot. On March 27th, Anthony attacked Scott Moulton and Denise Siotkowski, both 21, near a supermarket located in the city center. He took them outside the city to Oregon suburb, where he shot both after having his way with Siotkowski. In this instance, he acted without help from his younger brother. On August 21st, Anthony, again acting alone, attacked Daryl Cole and Stacy Balonek, both 21. After raping the girl, Cook beat Cole with a baseball bat he found in the latter's car interior, causing him fatal brain injuries. After repeated the act with Balonek, he hid both bodies in the trunk of the car. In September of that year, Anthony committed a crime in the rich part of the city, just two blocks away from the police station. Early in the morning, Cook threatened to rob the passengers of a parked van, who were 21-year-old Todd Sabo and 20-year-old Leslie Sawicki, after which he tied them up and tried to rape the woman. During the attempted rape, Sabo managed to free himself and fight off their attacker, who lost grip of his weapon. Sawicki then called the police and her father, Peter, a well-known businessman in Toledo, for help. While waiting for the arrival of law enforcement officers, Sabo and Sawicki tried to lynch Cook, but he resisted fiercely, managing to get a hold of his gun. He then shot Peter Sawicki and seriously wounded Todd Sabo, before disappearing. Cook's fingerprints were found at the crime scene by police, and examined. Since the killer apparently didn't pay attention to concealing his tracks, street informants told about him, and soon after, authorities found and arrested Anthony on October 14, 1981. Exposure No evidence was found that could incriminate Anthony Cook in other murders, and so, in 1982, he was found guilty of killing Peter Sawicki and sentenced to life imprisonment. After his brother's conviction, Nathaniel decided to cease his criminal lifestyle, and in the following years was arrested only for minor offences. In the mid-1990s, during one of these arrests, a blood sample was taken from him. Since both brothers left biological traces while committing the crimes, in 1998, DNA testing of the samples was carried out, which showed correspondence between the killers' profiles and that of the brothers.Reiter, Mark (2008). \\"True story of killings written by detective\\", The Blade (Toledo, Ohio) On February 13, 1998, Nathaniel was arrested and charged with the murder of Thomas Gordon and the attempted murder of his girlfriend. In 2000, the brothers accepted a plea bargain, pleading guilty to the murder of Gordon and describing in detail the other murders, in exchange that they wouldn't be charged with them. Ultimately, Nathaniel plead guilty to killing Thomas Gordon and to being complicit in the murders of Dawn Backes and Connie Thompson. Anthony plead guilty to 8 murders, in addition to confessing to the murder of 22-year-old Vickie Lynn Small, committed on December 20, 1973, which was never connected to the Toledo series.Seewer, John (2000). \\"2 admit 9 Toledo slayings in '80s\\" Associated Press, April 7, 2000 As was the deal, Anthony received a second life imprisonment term in April 2000, while his brother Nathaniel received a sentence of 75 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after 20 years. Aftermath After spending 34 years behind bars, Anthony Cook filed a motion for parole in 2015, but was denied and forbidden to file another one until 2025. Nathaniel, having served 20 years, also filed a parole application in 2018. Despite protests from the victims' relatives, the court, given the terms of agreement and the deal with the judge made in 2000, found no legal basis to prevent his release and granted the request.http://www.toledoblade.com/local/courts/2018/08/09/Toledo-serial- killer-Nathaniel-Cook-granted-release-from-prison/stories/20180809156 Nathaniel Cook was released on August 10, 2018, but his freedom is extremely limited: he's obliged to participate in rehabilitation programs for sex offenders, http://www.toledoblade.com/local/courts/2018/08/09/Toledo-serial- killer-Nathaniel-Cook-granted-release-from-prison/stories/20180809156 to wear a GPS bracelet, and is forbidden to approach places crowded by children.

Schartle became President of the combined agency, a position she held till her retirement in 1984. Authors represented  Eleanor Hibbert  In 1948, Schartle became Eleanor Hibbert's first editor when she worked on her very first Jean Plaidy book Beyond the Blue Hills (1947). In 1960 Schartle helped to revive the Gothic romance genre when she persuaded Eleanor Hibbert to write a new series of novels under the name Victoria Holt.  Mary Higgins Clark  In 1956 Schartle met novelist Mary Higgins Clark through a writer's workshop and became her literary agent for twenty years until her retirement. Schartle and Higgins Clark became such good friends that Higgins Clark named her fifth and last child Patricia Mary for their \\"winning combination\\".  Patricia Highsmith  Patricia Highsmith appointed Patricia Schartle as her literary agent in 1959, when Schartle was with Constance Smith Associates. After Constance Smith Associates merged with McIntosh & Otis in 1963, Schartle continued as Patricia Highsmith's American literary agent. A. M. Heath served as Patricia Highsmith's British agents. Over time, Patricia Highsmith came to resent the 5% commission each literary agency took. Patricia Schartle Myrer fired Highsmith as her client in 1979.  Noah Gordon  In 1965 Schartle helped Noah Gordon become a serious novelist by getting him a book contract with a publishing firm after he submitted an outline for a novel to Schartle. It was at Schartle's suggestion that Gordon then wrote the Cole trilogy, a series of books about the dynasty of a single family over many generations.

In 2012 Ardent Atheist won The People's Choice Podcast Awards in the religion inspiration category. In 1989-1991 Henderson was a regular on the nationally televised Dance Party USA show where she appeared as Baby Heather. In her teens, Henderson released a single called Give it up Baby Heather which received a positive review from Billboard magazine. She currently is a member of Penn Jillette's No God Band and is a vocal activist for atheism and against psychics. Early life Henderson was born on March 7, 1973 in Camden, New Jersey. Her mother was a Hungarian Jew. When Henderson was 10, in 1983, her father left the home. She attended Camden City Public Schools for elementary, middle and high school. She was a \\"shy and quiet girl\\" who did not talk back and listened to, and believed, everything her mother told her: \\"I did not grow up with critical thinking skills at all.\\" Henderson's mother died when Heather was 23, in 1996. Henderson's father, Ed Henderson, was a self-taught musician who worked as an EKG technician. He quit that job when Heather was seventeen in order to work full-time as a musician singing and playing the guitar and banjo. Henderson started singing with her father when she was seven. She also played the violin. Growing up, Henderson knew that she wanted to be \\"a star\\". At age fifteen, she appeared on a nationwide teen dance show called Dance Party USA. She appeared on the show regularly for three years and went by the nickname Baby Heather. Her favorite musicians were Prince and Milli Vanilli, and her favorite actor was Michael J. Fox. When Henderson's mother became involved with Jews for Jesus, they started attending progressive Christian churches. Henderson was very uncomfortable attending these churches because of how they treated the members. \\"I thought they were hypocrites,\\" she said. According to Henderson, they made fun of people who were poor and of a family who had a child with a mental disability. In addition, they asked for, \\"money all the time,\\" and scared the kids by telling them that God is always watching them and they are going to go to Hell. \\"It was awful for me.\\" As soon as she was old enough, Henderson told her mother she would not attend church again. In 2011, Henderson moved to Los Angeles with friends. In order to raise money to purchase a plane ticket, she organized a fundraiser for herself with burlesque friends who donated their talent for a one-night show. Film and television Henderson was a regular dancer on the local television show Dancin' on Air and the nationally televised, Dance Party USA from 1989 to 1991. In her last year, she became a co-host. Henderson has also appeared on Sesame Street, Nickelodeon's Double Dare, in the film Mannequin Two: On the Move, and on Disney's Annapolis. Henderson is also one of the lead singers with Tritone mainstay, Soulamite! A 16-year-old Baby Heather was interviewed along with her father while waiting to attend a Prince concert in Philadelphia. The reporter described her as \\"wearing a white and red polka-dot stocking and white boot on her left side and a beige stocking and black boot on her right. And that was all below the waist. For warmth she had on a ruffled shirt and short black jacket.\\" Of the way his daughter was dressed, Ed Henderson stated that \\"It's no big deal.\\" Baby Heather stated that this was normal attire for the Dance Party USA show she was on. At 3:30 Henderson can be seen pushing a shopping cart through a store on a Sesame Street episode. Music and recording career Heather Henderson of the No God Band at Penn Jillette's Private Rock & Roll, Bacon & Doughnut Party during TAM 9 (The Amaz!ng Meeting) in Las Vegas, NV. Taken on July 15, 2011 In her teens Henderson released a single called Give it up Baby Heather using her Dance Party moniker. Billboard magazine reviewed the single and said that it is \\"Empowered with a sturdy voice and promising blend of style and attitude\\". And, \\"... her voice is put to good use... with a Paula Abdul like chorus.\\" Henderson, as a fan of Penn Jillette, invited him to listen to some of her music and watch some of her videos, and soon after, they became friends. Jillette asked her to join his No God Band to perform at the yearly James Randi skeptic convention, The Amaz!ng Meeting. She has recorded background vocals for the songs, \\"Clay Aiken by Penn Jillette\\", \\"I Quit My Job - Love Theme from Director's Cut\\" and \\"Penn's Sunday School Theme\\". The No God Band performed at The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2011-2014. At Jillette's Bacon and Donut party, he described the event: '\\"There will be obscenity, there will be scantily clad people, there will be bacon, there will be donuts, you will learn nothing.\\"' Henderson has said she is not interested in a career as a singer, but will perform when asked. She does backup for Penn Jillette and for other projects by friends. She sings in an atheist choir in Los Angeles called the Voices of Reason Choir. Burlesque career Hollywood Burlesque Festival Dec. 6th 2013 Henderson worked from 1993 to 2010 in the erotica industry, stripping, burlesque, foot fetish parties, as a dominatrix and lap dancing. She wanted to be all things to people, \\"I'm hustling to be the everything girl.\\" She wanted to be on stage and she was comfortable with her sexuality. She felt that this might be a great way to express herself while making money. Known as Baby Heather, Henderson sported a mohawk or sometimes a shaven head. Henderson got involved with burlesque after a friend who was doing a \\"variety\\" show asked her to sing background. \\"I became hooked! It was the kind of place where I could perform the silly to the sexy, and I made a whole new group of friends.\\" In 2007, Henderson performed with the Peek-A-Boo Revue burlesque troupe and appeared at the monthly event Pousse Cafe' in Philadelphia, when she explained her philosophy of burlesque. She stated that in this environment shy women (in time) are, \\"dancing around naked and doing cartwheels...\\" The other workers help each other out by boosting confidence and paying attention to egos. \\"Shy performers end up being molded into brazen unafraid actors and dancers.\\" Henderson states that burlesque is about making fun of sex, \\"It's not so serious.\\" She eventually grew tired of the disrespect from club owners and customers and decided to get out of the trade in 2010. \\"Men come in there and they act like they don't know why we're there. Stop staring, give us a tip. We're working,\\" she says. Henderson felt that men were there for \\"faceless treats\\" and didn't understand that the industry is all about \\"fantasy with mutual respect.\\" She states that she misses the experience, learned a lot but the disrespect is why \\"I don't dance anymore,\\" says Henderson. \\"Fuck 'em.\\" In 2013, Henderson returned to perform at the first Hollywood Burlesque Festival. Time Out Los Angeles lists her as one of the \\"Best Burlesque\\" performers and calls her \\"the singing emcee with 'ferocious vocals.'\\" Modeling Henderson was a model for Dr Sketchy's Anti- Art School Philadelphia chapter in 2008, and 2009. She has been painted by illustrator, Julie Bell, and was pictured in her 2009 fantasy art wall calendar. She was on the cover of Heavy Metal Magazine with illustrations by Dave Palumbo. Henderson has her own Magic: The Gathering card entitled \\"The Deft Duelist\\", and in 2008 was the female model on the cover of Son of Hulk, published by Marvel Comics. In 2013, Henderson was used as a model in Tony Marsico's Wild Things: Burlesque Beauties and the Pets they Love. Palumbo has used Henderson for a series of oil paintings. Film making After working in burlesque Henderson felt that she could film things that might make others uneasy, using humor and music she filmed several short fetish videos because, \\"if others can do it so can I\\". Inspired by friend Norm Walker, her film PODONUTS features Walker eating cream-filled donuts off the feet of women (one of which is Henderson). Philadelphia Weekly states it \\"routinely wins over even the most squeamish spectators with its sex-positive message and thrillingly syncopated movement sequences.\\" Henderson states that she enjoys being behind the camera and watching people act naturally without knowing they are being filmed. For this reason she prefers to shoot documentaries. Henderson's 2009 film Marcella and Sofia a fetish film about a young couple being sexually corrupted by two female (one of which is Henderson) captors won a Claw Award for best cinematography from the Terror Film Festival. In 2010, Henderson began recording interviews with strippers in the dressing room of the strip clubs. Women freely talked about their lives and the men they entertained. Henderson tried to keep the interviews focused on the women \\"exploring the spot where fantasy and reality collide.\\" Henderson released five of these interviews on YouTube but says she has more footage and would like to turn it into a documentary. She hoped that male listeners might understand \\"We're real people, and it's not cool to just open your mouth and have any kind of trash come out just because we are half-naked or even naked,\\" she says. \\"We have feelings, we get hurt. We have your children. We're mothers.\\" Critical thinking In a 2011 interview with John Rael, Henderson describes herself as an \\"ardent atheist\\" not an \\"angry atheist\\". She describes an atheist as someone who does not believe in any kind of deity. She says that atheists are all different and hold all kinds of other beliefs and that just because they call themselves an atheist does not mean they are skeptics. She thinks that it is important to start talking about religion. It should not be off the table because \\"once you start talking about the bullshit of religion... you start talking about what is really true, where are the facts... where do you draw the line?\\" In Henderson's view, religion is the worst abuser, second are psychics who claim to talk to the dead. They \\"play on their (sitters') sadness, pull the answers out of them and then take their money... that's bullshit.\\" When interviewer Chris Brown asked her how she came to her atheism, she stated that \\"the thing that got me thinking was a movie I found called Zeitgeist... not so much the conspiracy theory stuff... but more about the Jesus story... I saw that and said 'I've been lied to my entire life'\\". This prompted her to do research and find what was true. Henderson credits the Internet for continuing her education into critical thinking. She ventured into various chat rooms on all different topics and found people who thought just like her. After that she credits magician Penn Jillette for challenging her to think skeptically about tarot, acupuncture, psychics, \\"I had no idea that stuff was crap.\\" When her mother died in 1996 she was not yet an atheist, that and Henderson discovering that she had cancer, \\"What kind of loving God does that to you\\"? She describes becoming an atheist like getting struck by lightning, \\"I woke up!\\" she felt that her mother and \\"everyone around me had lied to me... I wanted to shout it out to the world.\\" Henderson has no problem with other people believing in God, as long as they aren't hurting anyone or making voting decisions based on their religious beliefs, \\"I don't see any reason to attack them for that.\\" When asked if her experience with religion and atheism is different because she is black she responded, \\"There are still so many African Americans who are stuck in the slave mentality their ancestors handed down to them. They don't ask questions or wonder why there are laws for slavery in the Bible. They haven't done the research about why slavery was allowed to continue for so long in the U.S. They just follow what their parents and their parents before did: tradition. It's sad.\\" In an interview on Fox 13 recorded at the American Atheist convention held in Memphis, Easter 2015, Henderson was asked about being public about her atheism, the reporter commented on her prominent Ardent Atheist tattoo across her chest and said \\"You obviously don't worry about it\\". Her response was that she lives in a very liberal area, Los Angeles, \\"...and most people don't care. This is just a conversation starter out there.\\" Podcasts Recording Skeptically Yours 2014 Susan Gerbic, Mark Edward, Emery Emery and Heather Henderson Henderson is the co-host of two podcasts with Emery Emery, Ardent Atheists and Skeptically Yours. They started producing the Ardent Atheist podcast in February, 2011. \\"Emery is a professional comedian, and knows a lot of comedians so that is what we started with.\\" The show is like people talking in a \\"green room\\" with lots of arguing but with \\"love and kisses\\". She says, \\"I'm still learning, the show is my biggest teacher.\\" The show is live streamed every week using U-Stream. The show has a chat room which is published on the Internet for listeners to download. Ardent Atheists is \\"pretty raunchy... we have no restrictions on content.\\" Skeptically Yours is more mainstream, less about religion and more about other skeptical topics. Notable guests include, Brian Dunning, Mark Edward, Ian Harris, Dave Silverman, and Matt Kirshen. In 2012, Ardent Atheist won best podcast in the religion inspiration category for The People's Choice Podcast Awards. Notable guests on Ardent Atheist include, Richard Dawkins, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Paul Provenza, Kelly Carlin, Jamie Kilstein, From November 2012 to April 2013 Henderson appeared as a featured segment on the Skepticality podcast. Her segment was called News in Religion. At psychic John Edward Protest 2015 Skepticism In 2014, Henderson became more involved in skeptical activism with various projects mostly focused on psychics. Henderson and friends, Wendy Hughes and Henderson's partner Emery Emery, Brian Hart, Ed Clint and Paula formed Investigation Network, a Los Angeles-based skeptic group. In October 2014, Henderson joined Susan Gerbic's efforts to try and catch a psychic in a hot-read with Operation Bumblebee. Henderson and friends attended a Chip Coffey event in Los Angeles. She was not called on by Coffey but gained insight from her attendance and was able to provide intelligence to the San Jose crew to help them get selected by Coffey for readings. Operation Bumblebee was unable to catch Coffey in a hot-read, in their opinion his reading was no different than what would be experienced with a cold reading. In Gerbic's next effort to catch a psychic in a hot-read, Henderson played the lead role of believer in what Gerbic called Operation Ice Cream Cone. Henderson portrayed a bereaved mother of 13-year-old Andrew Hendersen. Gerbic and team created several fake Facebook pages with full stories about their lives. The team members friended each other as well as various psychics that had a strong Facebook presence. They created a full history for mother and son Andrew, which Henderson was unable to view and had no knowledge but the basics of, this created a double-blind experiment as Henderson was unable to give guiding feedback to Brahn as she didn't know what was on her Facebook page. In November 2014, Henderson, with permission to record, had an hour reading with psychic Tim Brahn. He was able to clearly communicate with her non-existent sons, non-existent husband and non-existent family. Operation Ice Cream Cone was unable to catch Brahn in hot-reading Henderson, in their opinion he used common cold-reading tactics. Full audio of reading is available on YouTube. Every statement Brahn made to Henderson is incorrect, including that she is a smoker, a mother and wife. Other activities by the Investigation Network include protests and handing out flyers at various psychic presentations including Theresa Caputo, John Edward, and James Van Praagh. Personal life Interviewed by Ed Clint as a part of a series of Inspiring Women of TAM 2013 she was asked if she were a feminist. She stated that the term is very confusing as there are so many types of feminists. She understands that some people may feel that because she was a stripper for many years, men took advantage of her. She identifies herself like this, \\"I'll just declare myself a woman.\\" Henderson is an official Friar (pastor) for the United Church of Bacon, which started in 2010 when friends gathered at the home of Penn Jillette. The Church's mission statement is \\"Hail Bacon, full of grease, the Lard is with thee.\\" Their goal is to fight prejudices against non-believers, promote church and state separation and to raise money for secular causes. In April 2015, Henderson and other secular groups protested Wells Fargo bank in Las Vegas over what they felt was discrimination and insensitive treatment by an employee when a member of the United Church of Bacon was refused a notarization. In an interview with Apple magazine in July 2014, she talks about how important Apple is to her career in entertainment. She states that she uses Apple products for running the podcasts, her private life, and even for managing the lights in her home (domed iMac PowerPC G4 processor). She uses Final Cut Pro and iMovie for her films. For recording the podcasts they use, a 2.4Ghz Quad-Core Intel Xeon Mac Pro, GarageBand, Saffire Mix Control, ATEM software and a Blackmagic video card. Henderson started out as a devoted PC user until a boyfriend insisted that she try out Apple products. \\"I never looked back, I love the look of them, the efficiency... they are so easy to use, now I'm hooked!\\" Heather Henderson and James Randi.jpgJames Randi and Henderson 2012 Penn & Teller with Heather Henderson.jpgPenn & Teller with Henderson 2013 Heather Henderson, Tim Minchin, Ryan Bell and the film crew of A Year Without God.jpgWith Tim Minchin, Ryan Bell and the producers for the documentary A Year Without God 2015 Heather Henderson and Bill Nye.jpgHenderson and Bill Nye 2015 Heather Henderson and Michael Shermer.jpgHenderson and Michael Shermer 2015 References  External links  *Official Audio Give it Up by Baby Heather *Ardent Atheist The Ardent Atheist Podcast *Skeptically Yours Skeptically Yours Podcast *YouTube Stripper Rant Podcast *YouTube Marcello And Sophia Movie - A short film by Henderson *YouTube PODOUNTS 1973 births Living people American atheism activists American skeptics American women podcasters American podcasters Musicians from Camden, New Jersey African-American activists African-American atheists African-American female singers American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent 21st-century American singers 21st-century American women singers ","title":"Heather Henderson"},{"id":"46593930","text":"Marie José Thériault (born March 21, 1945) is a Quebec writer, performer and translator.

Dickinson was born in Wallingford, Connecticut, and was the son of a Congregationalist minister, Charles H. Dickinson. His parents moved frequently; from 1894 to 1901 the family lived in Canandaigua, New York, and they spent time in Fargo, North Dakota and Calhoun, Alabama, where they assisted his aunt, Charlotte Thorn, in the running of the Calhoun Colored School. Dickinson studied with George Bridgman and William Merritt Chase at the Art Students League of New York from 1910 to 1911, and from 1910 to 1912 he was a pupil of Douglas Volk at the school of the National Academy of Design. He spent time traveling around the country doing manual labor, working in lumber camps and finding employment as a surveyor's roadman and farmhand.

Film studies scholar Carrie Tarr has written that audiences may have been confused by Kurys treatment of May '68 as nearly devoid of protest and politics, instead focusing on an explicitly female personal drama, as opposed to the generally male-centered view of the student revolts. She also notes that Kurys had had to rewrite the script due to budget constraints which made reenacting the barricading of Paris streets impossible, and further cut explicitly political scenes out in the editing process to further emphasize the teenagers' story.Tarr 1999, pgs. 39-40. Perhaps in a reaction to its lack of political content, Vincent Canby's 1981 review in the New York Times called the film \\"a nearly perfect example of the kind of French film that apotheosizes middle-class values while pretending to question them\\".Canby 1981.

Club career Italiano played his junior football at Stirling Lions and later Balcatta. He moved to Inglewood United and, aged 18, gained his league debut in May 2008 against Floreat Athena. Despite an impressive start with the club, first team opportunities were scarce across three seasons with Inglewood. Italiano returned to Balcatta in 2011 and quickly became the clubs' first choice goalkeeper. In 22 league appearances he tallied up eight clean sheets to play a key role in Balcatta lifting their first Premier League title. A summer deal with A-League club Perth Glory followed, however, Italiano's involvement throughout the 2011–12 campaign was restricted to watching from the bench. That was offset by regular appearances for the clubs' youth team which finished the home and away series in second place. After a short spell with Balcatta, Italiano headed east where he played an important role in Oakleigh Cannons finishing the Victorian Premier League in second spot. By October he was back with Glory having agreed a season-long deal as an injury replacement for Neil Young. Released by Perth without making a first team appearance, Italiano re-joined Oakleigh where he caught the eye of the then new Wellington Phoenix coach Ernie Merrick. He signed with Wellington in June 2013 and was handed the number 20 shirt for the coming A-League season. On 23 July 2014, Italiano played part of the second half of his club's friendly with London side West Ham United F.C. at Eden Park, making a notable save late on in an eventual 2–1 win for Wellington. Italiano made his A-League debut on 26 April 2015, playing the full match for Wellington Phoenix in a 2–1 loss against Sydney FC, instead of the injured Glen Moss. In May 2016, Italiano joined ECU Joondalup on loan for the remainder of the NPL WA season to get more game-time. In September 2016, after ECU Joondalup lost to Inglewood United in the preliminary final, Italiano returned to Wellington Phoenix after playing 17 games with ECU Joondalup and keeping 10 clean-sheets. In March and April 2017, Italiano played back to back matches for the Phoenix for the first time, in a 5-0 win over Newcastle Jets FC and a 3-0 win over Melbourne Victory FC. Italiano left the Phoenix in May 2017, joining National Premier Leagues Victoria side Bulleen Lions. He returned to the Phoenix one month later on a new one-season contract after strong performances for Bulleen and the appointment of new Wellington coach Darije Kalezić. After his contracted ended at the Wellington Phoenix, Italiano returned to his youth club Stirling Lions for the rest of their season.

Porto, Danny, who is playing for them currently, Jorge Costa, retired (F.C. Porto), Tarik Sektioui, who left F.C. Porto at the start of 2009/2010 league, Nuno Valente, retired, Ariza Makukula and many others. In 2003–04 Nacional achieved fourth place in the Portuguese League, their best classification ever. They repeated it three years later and are the only Madeiran team to finish fourth place in the Portuguese League. Nacional were the only Madeiran team that reached the Europa League group stage (in the 2009-2010 season) until Marítimo reached the group stages in the 2012-13 season. Cristiano Ronaldo, a football player, played in Nacional until he was 12 years old before moving to Sporting Lisbon. Nacional plays in the Madeira Stadium (Estádio da Madeira), considered by CNN in 2011, one of the eight more unusual stadiums in the world. Besides Cristiano Ronaldo, other known footballers played in Nacional like Paulo Assunção (played in F.C. Porto and Atletico Madrid), Ruben Micael (played in F.C. Porto and Zaragoza), Maicon (F.C. Porto), Diego Benaglio (Wolfsburg) and Felipe Lopes (Wolfsburg). Outside the Portuguese top league, there are two other Madeiran teams: U.D. Santana and A.D. Pontassolense. U.D. Santana was relegated from the Portuguese Second Division so it now competes in the Portuguese Third Division while A.D. Pontassolense plays in the Portuguese Second Division. Basketball In recent years, Madeira has had a considerable amount of success in professional basketball, with CAB Madeira having won numerous titles, especially their female team. CAB is often seen competing in European matches such as the FIBA EuroCup and former stars include Filipe da Silva and ex-Los Angeles Lakers player Ike Nwankwo. Surfing Paul do Mar: this spot, according to surf experts, has the best barreling waves (also known as tubular, tunnel waves) on Madeira. Both stand-up surfing and bodyboarding are practised at this spot. In 2001 the World Surfing Championships were held in Madeira at Surfspots including Paul do Mar, Ponta Pequena and Jardim do Mar (see Surfing in Madeira). Handball Madeira Andebol SAD, the island's only professional handball team is one of the most successful in the country. Running The oldest Saint Silvester Road Race in Portugal and one of the oldest in the Europe Union is held every December 28 and is called the Volta à cidade do Funchal and is made up of professional and amateur runners. There is also the Madeira Island Ultra Trail which is an ultramarathon, that takes place once a year. More to that there are: Boa Ventura Trail run, Sky Trail Camp – Porto da Cruz, Trail de Porto Moniz – São Vicente, Madeira Trail Camp – São Vicente, Trail do Porto Santo, Madeira Trail Series – São Vicente, Trail do Ludens de Machico, Corrida Nocturna Baia dos Descubrimentos, Vertical KM – Câmara de Lobos, Trail da Zona Militar da Madeira, Ultra Sky Marathon Madeira, Cristo Rei Trail, Funchal Sky Race, Trail de Água de Pena, Ultra Trail Porto da Cruz Natura, Trail de Santa Cruz, Vertical KM – Funchal, Madeira Uphill 2000, Vertical KM – Fanal, Eco Trail do Funchal, Trail de Câmara de Lobos, Trail da Calheta, Trail Nocturno de Machico, Source Scuba diving thumbnail Scuba diving has become very popular in recent years due to the crystal waters and the abundance of life that characterize Madeira. Recently explored, Ponta de São Lourenço can offer the best dive sites of the island. This area is reachable from the very close Marina of Quinta do Lorde. The clear waters and marine life of Madeira, known for its numerous nature reserves and marine areas, offer countless fascinating and electrifying dive spots. The marine fauna of this region consists mainly of coastal species. Sandy and rocky bottoms host numerous species of marine creatures: groupers (Epinephelus guaza) and other serranids, salps, sea bream, mullet, scorpion fish (Scorpaena scrofa), moray eels, octopuses, cuttlefish, barracudas, damsels are just some of the species that divers may commonly spot. Among the invertebrates, besides various species of anemones and starfish, we emphasize the presence of numerous bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata), known for their considerable size (up to 30 cm) and for their painfully stinging bristles. Common are also several species of crabs; the most curious of them is definitely the arrow crab (Stenorhynchus seticornis). Large, typically pelagic organisms can also be occasionally encountered: wahoos, tunas, cetaceans (i.e. the spotted dolphin and Risso’s dolphin), sea turtles, manta rays and mobulas, and the famous but rare monk seal (Monachus monachus). Walking and hiking Hiking along a levada in Madeira Madeira offers about of walks, many alongside the levadas, some of the island's greatest attractions. The levadas provide stunning walks, some of which are quite challenging. Canyoning has increased in popularity over the last few years with many companies offering canyoning tours. Other sports The Rali Vinho da Madeira is the largest sporting event held in the archipelago each year, attracting thousands of spectators from Europe. The motor rally (established in 1959) has been part of several international pan-European championships since the 1970s, most notably the European Rally Championship and the Intercontinental Rally Challenge. Karting and golf are other popular sports played on the island. The island lies in an ideal location for water sports such as fishing, sailing and diving due to its climate and location. Jogo do Pau, a Portuguese martial art, is still practiced in the rural areas of the island but has declined since its peak in the early part of the 20th century. Madeira is also popular as a Moauntain bike destination, organizing stops of the Enduro World Series championship** References See also * Sport in Portugal ","title":"Sport in Madeira"},{"id":"46594445","text":"Kari C. Nadeau is an American physician-scientist focused on allergy and asthma treatment at Stanford University School of Medicine. She is the Naddisy Family Foundation Professor of Allergy and the director of the Sean N Parker Center for Allergy Research at Stanford. Her team was among the first to show that high dimensional immunophenotyping of T cells involved in allergy could be used in therapies for patients. Her research has also shown that blocking antibodies in conjunction with allergen immunotherapy produced desensitization even in patients with up to five food allergens. Education After graduating from Haverford College with a degree in biology, Nadeau attended Harvard Medical School via the Medical Scientist Training Program (NIH), and received a PhD in biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology and an MD in 1995. She then performed an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School. From 1998 to 2002, she worked in the field of biopharmaceuticals and led clinical research to obtain FDA approval for two biologics in the field of Autoimmunity and Oncology, respectively. From 2003 to 2006, Nadeau was a fellow in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology at the Stanford/UCSF program under Dale Umetsu. During this time, she also did a postdoctoral fellowship in human immune tolerance mechanisms in asthma and allergy. Career In 2006, Nadeau was appointed to the Stanford University School of Medicine with appointments in Pediatrics and Otolaryngology. In 2016 she was named the Naddisy Foundation Professor of Pediatric Food Allergy, Immunology and Asthma endowed professorship under the Naddisy Family Foundation. Nadeau has served as a reviewer for NIH Study Sections, and a member of the American Lung Association Medical Board, CA. She serves on the Environmental Health Policy committee for the American Thoracic Society and is a Fellow in the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and is a member of ASCI (American Society of Clinical Investigation). Her laboratory focuses on the study of immunological mechanisms involved in the cause, diagnosis, and therapy for allergy and asthma. In December, 2014 Sean Parker donated $24 million to Stanford to establish the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy Research at Stanford University, with Nadeau as the director. In September 2020, Dr. Kari Nadeau published The End of Food Allergy: The First Program To Prevent and Reverse a 21st Century Epidemic with co-author Sloan Barnett. Research Nadeau's laboratory is working on scientific investigations of immune tolerance. Areas of research include: Monitoring T cells in immunotherapy and their effect on tolerance Translational work (through conducting novel and innovative clinical studies to induce tolerance through immunotherapy) on Treg function and epigenetic changes of pivotal loci in Foxp3 and IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-4. This research led to novel findings on markers of immune tolerance in a pilot clinical trial using peanut oral immunotherapy for near fatal peanut allergy. Mechanisms of food allergy immunotherapy Research focusing on safe and effective treatments for food allergies. A pilot multifood allergen immunotherapy trial demonstrated that oral immunotherapy can simultaneously and successfully achieve desensitization for multiple allergens and that adjunct use of omalizumab facilitates and decreases time to desensitization. A follow-up double-blind, randomized, controlled phase 2 study provided further evidence that in multifood allergic patients, omalizumab improves the efficacy of multifood oral immunotherapy and enables safe and rapid desensitization. The data from clinical trials provided initial evidence for the safety and feasibility of oral immunotherapy for food allergies. T cell epitope use, discovery, and allergen identification Clinical trials involving participants with multiple food allergies has enabled determination of associations and cross-reactivities of different food allergens. These studies have further assisted with epitope mapping, identification, and characterization of allergenic components of foods that induce clinical reactivity. Data from these studies may, in the future, enable therapeutic targets for food allergies. Biomarkers and pollution/clinical outcomes Dedicated, collaborative teams examining plasma, cellular, and epigenetic markers that are affected by air pollution in children, adolescents, and adults. Using well characterized cohorts in the Bay Area (for acute pollution exposure—i.e. wildfire) and in the Central Valley (for chronic exposure—i.e. Fresno is one of the highest ranked cities in the country for PM2.5 air pollution), we have been able to perform innovative and impactful research that has helped shape public policy towards mitigating pollution and its effects on the public, (especially those at risk populations (like children) and the underserved (like Hispanic populations in the Central Valley of California). Pollution and asthma A number of environmental pollutants, caused by human activity, have been associated with asthma. Short-term and long-term exposures to high levels of CO, NO2, and PM2.5 mediate epigenetic alterations of Foxp3 and IL-10, key genes known to be associated with T cells and atopic disease. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, found at high levels in areas of increased traffic, decrease telomere length. Honors and awards * 2006 Parker B.

Cannon Sr. (August 3, 1925 – July 2, 2005) was an American philanthropist. In 2004 he co-authored the book Poor Man's Philanthropist: The Thomas Cannon Story with the photojournalist Sandra Waugaman. Background Cannon was born on August 3, 1925, to Eliza Cannon. Along with his mother and three siblings, Cannon moved to Chase City, Virginia after the death of Cannon's father, a Holiness minister, to live with his grandmother in a shack with no running water or electricity. He received his primary education at Chase City Graded School and attended the Thyne Institute. Both schools were segregated and Thyne required that students pay for tuition, book costs, and other expenses. As Cannon's family could not afford these expenses, Cannon dropped out in the seventh grade and began working a series of odd jobs to support his family. During this time he would make occasional visits to see his brother in Richmond, where he met Princetta (who was eleven at the time), who would eventually become his wife. Around the early 1940s Cannon began working on a construction crew at Camp Pickett, where he dug ditches and served as a water boy. When he turned seventeen Cannon had his mother sign enlistment papers so he could join the United States Navy and serve during World War II. While in the Navy Cannon learned Morse code, which enabled him to serve as a signalman - a position that was not frequently held by black American soldiers during that time period. In 1944 he was sent to attend gunnery school, during which time his military unit was ordered to load a munitions ship that exploded, killing 322 soldiers. During his service Cannon was twice transferred to different ships, each of which was involved in accidents shortly after his transfer. Cannon would later credit these three incidents, along with several incidents where he narrowly escaped harm, as influential in his philanthropy, stating \\"Such escapes made me believe that I was being preserved for something\\". After he returned from duty Cannon enrolled in the eighth grade in order to finish his schooling and received a high school equivalency degree. He also married his childhood friend Princetta and went on to attend Hampton University, where he graduated with a degree in fine arts in 1954. Prior to joining the US Postal Service in 1957, Cannon briefly served as an art consultant to Richmond schools. In the 1990s Cannon began serving as the full-time caretaker of Princetta, whose health began to decline in the beginning of the decade. This put a large financial strain on the family's finances and in 1995 a local Richmond developer began a benefit fund to raise money to provide the Cannons with a new home and help with Princetta's medical care. In his later life Cannon developed colon cancer and he died on July 2, 2005. Philanthropy Cannon first began donating money in 1972 and he frequently chose people that he had heard about in the news. In 1974 he sent a donation of $50 to each United States governor in honor of the United States Bicentennial and received letters from many of them, including future President Ronald Reagan. Cannon continued to send in donations to people he saw or read about in the news, accompanying each donation with a letter, poem, and a \\"hug coupon\\". Typical recipients of Cannon's philanthropy were people who had been featured in the news for having experienced hardship or for performing acts of heroism, generosity, or nobility. Most recipients were not independently wealthy, although Cannon would reward wealthy persons that he felt displayed good qualities. Over his lifetime Cannon is believed to have given away an estimated $156,000.

Early years Cameron was born in New Amsterdam, British Guiana, to parents Donald Charles Cameron, plantation manager, and his wife Margaret Anne (née Moore).Cameron, John (1847–1914) - Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 3 May 2015. His grandfather had been an officer of the 79th Highlanders at the Battle of Waterloo. His father left for Australia in 1852 and after settling in Victoria his family followed on the SS Great Britain the following year. On their arrival, the family took up Native Creek and later Berremboke stations near Geelong. Whilst in Victoria, Cameron attended Scotch College in Melbourne and Geelong Grammar School where, he later claimed \\"I never did any good beyond being a good fighter\\". After leaving school in 1859, he began work as a jackaroo and two years later the Camerons joined up with the Crombie family to drive their flocks to Barcaldine in Queensland. Around 1865, John Cameron went out on his own and found work as an overseer at Alice Downs before becoming manager of Wilby Downs. The Camerons and Crombies joined with others to form a business partnership that embraced seven properties which John later became a partner in. In 1877, the business was wound up but Cameron, along with his brother-in-law, James Crombie, kept control of Kensington Downs and Greenhills. After that partnership folded in 1881, Cameron joined with his mother in the running of Kensington Downs. Political career Cameron, representing the Opposition, stood for the seat of Mitchell at the 1893 colonial election, and defeated Charles Fitzgerald, the Labour candidate, and J. Campbell, an independent. He served one term before losing his seat to Fitzgerald in 1896. At the 1899 election, Cameron, now representing the Ministerialists, stood for the seat of Barcoo but was defeated by Labour's George Kerr. In 1901, the state member for Brisbane North, Thomas MacDonald-Paterson, resigned the seat to enter Federal Parliament and Cameron was his replacement. He held the seat until 1908 when ill-health forced his resignation. Personal life Cameron married Sarah Annie Lodge in Mudgee and together had four sons and one daughter. One of the sons, Sir Donald Cameron, went on to have a distinguished career in the Federal Parliament. Sarah died in 1893 and in 1899 he married Louise Christine Heussler, the daughter of John Heussler. This marriage realised one son. Cameron died in Brisbane in June 1914 and after a private funeral was buried at Toowong Cemetery.Cameron John – Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 3 May 2015.

From a mechanical standpoint, it was closely related to the 1913 35 HP Theta passenger car. It was Lancia's first military vehicle. Development and service history At the outbreak of the Italo- Turkish War of 1911, the Royal Italian Army, whose motorisation had only begun a few years before, was chiefly equipped with Fiat 15 trucks. After a positive experience on the field, the army handed out additional procurements contracts of trucks for tactical and logistical use, to both Fiat and other manufacturers. One of them was Lancia, which developed the 1Z and began deliveries in 1912, in time for the vehicle to see war service on the harsh terrains of Libya. Production and army use continued into the First World War. In 1916, Ansaldo and Lancia jointly built an armored car on the 1Z chassis, named Automitragliatrice Lancia Ansaldo 1Z. These were the Royal Italian Army main armored vehicle and were used in riot control and later in the war to quickly exploit infantry breakthroughs. An improved type, the Lancia Ansaldo 1ZM, was produced in 1918. In 1915, Lancia introduced the Jota truck, which used the same 4.5-litre engine but had a dedicated chassis; production of the 1Z truck subsequently ended during 1916.  Self-propelled artillery  In 1917 the 1Z truck was selected as the carrier for 75/26 A.V. guns to form self-propelled anti-aircraft artillery; designated Autocannone da 75/27 A.V., the weapon system consisted of an anti-aircraft gun permanently installed in the bed of a partially armored 1Z. The pintle mounted 75/26 A.V. (Anti Velivolo, anti-aircraft) was based on the 75/27 Mod. 1906 field gun modified for use in the anti-aircraft role. The initial order of 50 guns was later halved to 25, to form six mobile batteries (Autobatterie) which were delivered in summer 1918; the experiment was short lived, as the weapon did not prove satisfactory in the field and the guns were soon dismounted to be used in static positions. The Italian artillery arm also used the 1Z as a gun platform in a self-propelled artillery role carrying 75/27 Mod. 1911 guns portee-style. Six batteries were formed in late 1918, and from 1920 to 1928 were assigned to the horse artillery branch. Specifications The 1Z was powered by the Tipo 61 4,940 cc side valve, monobloc inline four-cylinder engine delivering at 2,200 rpm. The chassis was a conventional ladder frame with solid axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs; brakes were on the transmission and on the rear wheels. The transmission was a Tipo 105 4-speed manual gearbox with a multi- plate dry clutch. Main differences from the Theta's mechanicals were wider axle tracks, and tyres and metal disc wheels more suited to military use. The vehicle had a top speed of and could carry 2.2 tons of cargo.

On January 30, 1948, the president received a confidential report from the commissioner of public buildings warning of the \\"imminent collapse\\" of the Second Floor of the mansion.Klara, P.41 In February, the president invited the president of the American Institute of Architects, Douglas Orr, and the president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Richard E. Dougherty, to \\"make a structural survey of the safety of the White House\\". Their one-day investigation concluded with a report issued that same day which said the second floor structure was a fire hazard and was in danger of collapse. They recommended that the second floor should be reconstructed as soon as possible, electricity use be cut to a minimum, and that further investigations be undertaken.Klara, P.58 Congress provided $50,000 for a more thorough investigation and additional engineers and other professionals were engaged from the private sector. Walls, ceilings, and floors were opened up to provide access to the investigators.Klara, P.59 Collapse Split beam supporting the Second Floor under Margaret Truman's Sitting Room, 1949 In June 1948, a leg of Margaret Truman's piano crashed through the floor in her second floor sitting room and through the ceiling of the Family Dining Room below. Investigators found the floor boards to have rotted, the main floor beam was split completely through, and the ceiling below had dropped 18 inches. The investigators determined that the west end of the Second Floor was sinking. The First Family was relocated from the west to the east end of the floor.Klara, P.63-64 Steel bracing was added to support the Second Floor and ceilings throughout the residence. The investigation concluded that the problem was in fact a collapsing building, not just a floor, and \\"heroic remedies\\" would be required.Klara, P.68 That year was an election year and the president feared that news of the collapsing White House would serve as an unflattering metaphor for his administration. On September 30, 1948, the White House Architect announced that the White House's \\"structural nerves\\" had been damaged, the second floor would need to be rebuilt, but that overall the building was in \\"good shape\\". He estimated the cost of repairs might be $1 million.Klara, P.69 The on-site forensic investigations continued while the First Family was away campaigning. In October, the ceiling of the East Room began to collapse and required wood supports. The structure under the Main Stair was found to be crumbling. The president's bathtub had begun sinking into the floor. The investigators discovered that the foundations of the interior walls supporting the upper floors and roof were all but non-existent. As they sank into the ground, the interior walls and floors were pulling away from the exterior walls leaving large gaps. They determined that the interior of the house was sinking and in danger of collapsing inwards; the entire mansion was unsafe (except for the new Truman Balcony).Klara, P.71 Upon returning to the White House the day after winning the election, the president was informed that the Federal Works Agency was about to do what his political opponents could not: remove him from the White House. On November 7, 1948, the news was made public.NYT article November 7, 1948, quoted in National Journal February 26, 2013 The Trumans departed town and within two weeks the White House was vacated. Furniture, staff, and the First Family moved into the White House guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue. Contributing factors There were multiple contributing factors that led to the White House's pending collapse in 1948, including original and subsequent design flaws, improper materials, multiple small and major renovations carried out by many presidents to accommodate differing tastes, needs, and advances in technologies. Collectively, they were described as a \\"slow murder\\" of the White House.Frederick Gutheim, \\"Rebuilding The White House\\", Architectural Record, June 1949. Fire: In August 1814, the White House was gutted by a fire set by British troops during the War of 1812; only a heavy rainstorm prevented the entire structure from being destroyed. By 1817, the building had been rebuilt. Key portions of the scorched wooden structure were re-used. Later in the 19th Century, used bricks were used in renovations and by 1948 were crumbling. Services: Technological advances in heating, plumbing, lighting, communications, and elevators were all added into the White House during its first century-and-a-half. When the White House was constructed, it had no indoor plumbing, on-site running water, fire fighting systems, electricity, or communications systems. Many of these were cut through major structural supports, including reducing wooden beams from 14 to 2 inches thickness.Klara, P.79 Earlier systems that became obsolete, such as old water pipes, gas pipes for lights, and forced-air heating ducts, were abandoned in place, adding significant weight to the building. 1902 Renovation: In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt engaged architect Charles F. McKim of McKim, Mead, and White for a major renovation. In addition to adding a “temporary” West Wing and upgrading interior finishes, the work included adding bathrooms, removing the west stair, expanding the second floor West Sitting Hall, and expanding the State Dining Room. This involved removing a load-bearing wall which had supported the floor and walls above and then hanging them from the existing attic (later Third Floor) and roof structure. Many structural deficiencies were noted and partially addressed in what McKim termed a \\"nip and tuck\\".Klara, P.82 Third Floor Addition: In 1927, President Coolidge engaged architect William Delano to design and add a concrete and steel Third Floor under a rebuilt roof. The original roof and attic floor were supported only on the heavy exterior walls; this renovation transferred much of their weight onto the interior walls which by 1948 began to fail. Bathrooms added to this new floor were outfitted with second-hand pipes that over the following years leaked and caused water damage on the floors below. Foundations: The interior supporting walls were made of brick without proper foundations, unlike the thick exterior sandstone walls supported on relatively deep and wide foundations. By 1948, the interior walls were settling significantly into the underlying clay soils and thin rubble base, causing them to pull away from the exterior walls. In time, the exterior walls would have been pulled in and collapsed. Schedule: A contributing factor common to most of this work was a rushed schedule. Presidents facing a four-year term didn't have the time, and in many cases, the patience, to provide the time needed for the design and construction to be done in a proper manner. For the 1902 renovation, the president allowed just four months. Project definition By late 1948, three main options were considered for replacement of the White House: * Demolish and rebuild the interior, keeping the exterior walls intact. * Demolish the building entirely and construct a new executive mansion. * Demolish the building entirely, salvage the exterior walls and rebuild them and a new interior. During 1949, the investigations were completed, the architectural and engineering design was finalized, and cost estimates concluding the early estimate of $1 million was inadequate. In addition to simply replacing the interior, the mansion was to be modernized, the Third Floor expanded, two basement levels added, and a major expansion of underground spaces for air conditioning and other services. The total number of rooms was nearly doubled to 132. There was significant debate among Congressional committee members considering the project, including many in Congress who were outwardly hostile towards the president. Both Trumans lobbied in favor of preserving the exterior walls intact, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a newspaper column advocating for its preservation, and the White House Architect also expressed his support. The desire to seek the most economic solution was weighed against the costs of maintaining the White House's historic presence. In the autumn of 1949, Congress authorized funding of $5.4 million ($57.5 million in 2020 dollars) for the entire project to reconstruct the White House while keeping the exterior walls in place. Key participants The reconstruction project was notable for both its complexity as well as the prominence and importance of the White House and its occupants to the country. Commission on the Renovation of the Executive Mansion President Truman and the Committee for the Renovation of the Executive Mansion, 1949 Congress created the Commission on the Renovation of the Executive Mansion following the March 1949 recommendation of the president. It was granted authority to act on behalf of the federal government in the execution of the project, including responsibility for the White House and its site. It was composed of six men: two each appointed by the president, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. The president appointed American Institute of Architects president Douglas Orr and American Society of Civil Engineers president Richard E. Dougherty. Additional members of the commission were Senator Kenneth D. McKellar (chairman), Senator Edward Martin, Representative J. Harry McGregor, and Representative Louis C. Rabaut. Supporting them were a team of consulting architects, engineers, and contractors. It continued its work until October 1952. Fine Arts Commission The United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) had approving authority for most of the design work, including interiors. Advising the commission was architect William Adams Delano of the New York firm of Delano and Aldrich, former chair of the commission, and architect of the 1927 Third Floor addition and advisor for the 1946 Truman Balcony. The CFA was granted Congressional authority to review, but did not have formal authority. President Truman had all but ignored them after they rejected his balcony, but their opinion carried significant weight with public and Congressional opinion and so their approval was sought for major design decisions of the reconstruction project.Klara, P.28 Resident owner The president was both the chief executive of the White House’s owner, the recent and future resident, and the current occupant of the West Wing. While the Commission was in overall charge of the project, the project manager, the day-to-day management and the contractor who executed the work, President Truman was a highly influential participant from early design and throughout all stages of construction. From an early meeting he made known he had a history of watching over the general contractor (while a senator overseeing construction of the Pentagon). The president was also known to conduct tours, sometimes daily, of the worksite, including climbing scaffolding. Truman was a man of strong opinions relating to architecture and history and in directing the work he made his presence felt. Architect Lorenzo Winslow, the White House Architect, was employed by the Public Works Administration. He had been in the position since it was created for him by President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1933 Winslow won a competition to design a White House swimming pool.Klara, P.30 He maintained a close working relationship with President Truman throughout his administration. Project Manager The Commission selected General Glen E. Edgerton as the overall manager of the project. His experience included selecting the route of the Panama Canal and constructing the Alaska Highway during World War II. He began work for the Commission in July 1949, just before they made the decision on reconstruction.Klara, P. 110 Contractor The general contractor was John McShain Inc., headed by John McShain, the \\"Builder of Washington\\" who had constructed (among other works) the Jefferson Memorial, the Pentagon, and the FDR Library at Hyde Park. McShain's on-site construction manager was Paul Hauck, who had also been in charge of the Pentagon project. Reconstruction The scope of the project involved the complete removal of the interior of the White House, except for the Third Floor, and included salvage and storage of critical interior elements, excavation of new basement levels, and construction of new foundations, steel and concrete structure, masonry interior walls with plaster finish and wood paneling, custom plaster moldings, refurbished and replacement windows, and new heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, electrical, and communications systems. The bulk of the work was to be accomplished within the exterior stone walls which were to be kept in place and repainted. Landscaping around the house was to be replaced. All workers were subjected to security clearance by the Secret Service. The West Wing was to be kept fully operational and occupied by the president and his staff. All work was to be completed for a total cost of $5.4 million and completed by late 1951 (in 660 days, approximately 22 months).Klara, P.135 Changes in design The State Dining Room after the 1902 Roosevelt renovation with the pre-reconstruction paneling The Grand Stair from the Cross Hall. During the reconstruction it was revised to open into the Entrance Hall with a landing at this end The rooms of the State Floor were reconstructed with few significant changes. The Second Floor rooms were adjusted to provide built-in closets and additional bathrooms, but otherwise were rebuilt largely as they had been. The Third Floor was expanded and the rooftop solarium replaced. Two new basement levels were added under the Ground Floor. The most noticeable change to the State Floor was revising the Grand Stair to discharge eastward into the Entrance Hall to provide a more ceremonial procession from the upstairs. The opening to the south was kept with a railing providing a balcony-type overview into the Cross Hall. On the Second Floor, the rooms above the East Room were lowered due to a thinner (yet stronger) steel floor structure. This allowed access from the Central Hall via a short ramp in a central passageway that was narrowed to accommodate an additional service stair and added closets. Additions to the Ground Floor included additional service elevators to service the upper floors, a bowling alley, expanded kitchen, broadcast studio, barber shop, medical and dental clinics, carpentry and upholstery shops, and large service and equipment spaces. The style Winslow selected for the interior finishes of the re-created main public rooms was the Federal style from the 1800-1820 period of President Monroe's rebuilding. This was a reversal from the variety of styles added in the previous 120 years. Winslow incorporated more marble flooring and paneling for aesthetics and ease of maintenance. Some changes requested by the Trumans, such as brightening the State Dining Room by painting the dark wood paneling \\"Federalist\\" celadon green, were also popular in the mid-20th Century. Bidding and delivery In September, 1949 the Commission invited bids from interested general contractors. Screening for required experience and capacity was undertaken by each bidder having to complete a detailed questionnaire. The construction delivery method, or type of construction contract, was a \\"fixed-fee-cost-plus\\", meaning the work would be performed for the cost of the materials and labor plus a fixed fee for the general contractor's overhead and profit. On October 28, 1949, the General Services Administration received bids from 15 general contractors ranging up to $950,000 for fees. The low bid was for $100,000 from John McShain Inc.; by the end of the project, he had reportedly lost approximately $200,000, bringing his total costs for supervision, management, and other overhead to around $300,000.\\"White House Man\\", Time, November 14, 1949Klara, P.233 Construction Removing debris from the interior, February 1950 Demolition of the Second Floor Oval Study and the Blue Room below, March 1950 Demolition on the Second Floor, January 1950 Construction of underground service and utility spaces by the northeast corner of the mansion, November 1950 On December 13, 1949, construction work began on site. There was no groundbreaking or commencement ceremony. Security fencing went around the work area and a solid screen provided privacy for the West Wing. Temporary sheds and buildings were erected on the South Lawn. By March 20, 1950, the removal of historic material slated for salvage had been completed. New underpinning foundations extending down 20 feet to better bearing material were hand dug under the existing exterior walls. Interior steel shoring was added to brace the exterior walls and support the existing Third Floor and roof. Demolition began with much of the material removed from the interior via chutes through window openings and by wheelbarrow. By mid-1950 the White House interior was essentially a shell encompassing over a million cubic feet of mostly empty space. By October the new, permanent steel structure was in place and construction of suspended concrete floors to replace the former wood and masonry structure began. For the following year-and-a-half, the new interior walls, doors, windows, wiring, pipes, services, and finishes were constructed. Key challenges From the outset the reconstruction project faced significant challenges. Access to the area of work was highly restricted, both by security, the occupied West Wing, and by the exterior stone walls which had to remain in place. The logistics of construction were complex; it was described as needing to \\"balance a stone house in the sky\\" while new foundations were dug beneath its walls.Klara, P. 119 The architect was often behind in providing key drawings, specifications, and reviews to the contractor, in part due to delays in obtaining numerous approvals from the Commission. There were almost no record drawings showing the existing construction, which required added investigations and details to be developed during construction. From 1950 the Korean War brought inflation and shortages of key materials and labor. Protective measures The biggest change during construction was announced on August 1, 1950, when the president authorized a separate and highly secret project. Project 9 was officially described as \\"certain protective measures\\" to be added to the new basement: an underground shelter to resist attack from an atomic bomb. It was designed by the same architect and contractor as the main project and installed under the East Terrace and the garden to the south, between the mansion and the East Wing. Access was through the northeast corner of the new basement level. This additional construction included major excavation, heavy concrete reinforcement of the mansion's basement, upgrading the existing air raid shelter, and dismantling much of the East Terrace and colonnade. Inside the mansion a heavily reinforced concrete tunnel to connect the West and East Wings was added through the middle of the new basement, which complicated and delayed the main construction.Klara, P.159David F. Krugler, \\"This Is Only a Test: How Washington D.C. Prepared for Nuclear War,\\" Pp.71-73. Palgrave MacMillan, 2006. 9781403983060. Retrieved 2015-04-28 Preservation Historic preservation of buildings during this time was not as strict or defined as it became later. For its time, simply not demolishing the entire structure was deemed \\"preservation\\". Winslow envisioned many of the interior items – from doors, trim, woodwork, and ornamental plaster – would be reused. Most were carefully dismantled, labelled, catalogued, and stored. Much of the paneling was reinstalled in the main public rooms, but other historic elements were simply copied to accommodate increasing cost and time constraints. Many of the original materials that were not deemed of significantly identifiable historic value, such as marble fireplace mantels, or not deemed to be readily reused, such as pipes, were sent to landfills. To avoid profiteering from the millions of items being carted away from the work site, the project ran a highly publicized souvenir program. Prior to its establishment in January 1951, over 20,000 requests were made for everything from nails to charred wood. Under the program, people could request an order form. From a warehouse, pre-assembled kits were distributed for as little as 25 cents. The kits included items such an individual brick, nearly a ton of stone, or special paperweights. The program ended in October 1951 and reported a profit of over $10,000. Interior finishes & furnishings The Blue Room after the reconstruction, 1952 During the very hasty move-out from the White House in late 1948, the B. Altman and Company department store offered to move and store the more valuable White House furnishings in their climate-controlled warehouses, for a nominal sum. The government deemed it to be \\"in the interests of the United States\\" and therefore not subject to public bidding requirements.Klara, P.89 The store later offered their interior design, decorating, and furniture supply services at true cost with no profit or ability to advertise the work. The government also deemed this to be in the public interest. The Commission provided a budget for the furniture, rugs, draperies, and special wall fabric of just $210,000, 10% less than the cost to provide temporary sheds during construction. This budget for 66 rooms allowed for no sourcing of any authentic antiques and resulted in a less than satisfactory furniture selection of antique furniture. However, Benjamin Altman and Company delivered the highest quality furniture possible designed and built by a talented cadre of furniture makers. This included Charles Fiesel, renowned furniture maker, who eventually became the head of interior decorating at B. Altman and Company. Originally from Alsace Lorraine, Fiesel traveled from his Garden City, New York home on sourcing expeditions throughout America in search of the finest wood available (white maple, cherry, oak, and other varieties) designated for furniture that was in design/build status. Furniture that was considered new at the time is now considered masterful and classic American.White House Historical Association. Timelines - Decorative Arts 1950s-2000s. Retrieved 2015-05-02 Budget and schedule Cost escalations due to labor shortages and wartime inflation caused an expected cost overrun of $321,000. Congress agreed to fund $261,000, bringing the total cost of the project to $5.7 million.Klara, P.212 The difference was made by cutting into other areas, including the budget for furniture and interiors. The secret bomb shelter cost $881,000 but was funded out of a separate fund controlled by the president. The original schedule called for the work to be finished in late 1951. By the end of 1950 the contractor estimated it would take until 1952. John McShain encountered the president at a football game on January 1, 1951 and jokingly told the president he would be in the White House that summer. The president took him seriously, announced it publicly, and invited Princess Elizabeth to visit in the autumn. The state visit occurred, but not in the (unfinished) White House. In early 1952 the president directed that the work needed to be complete by early April in time for a state visit by Queen Juliana of The Netherlands. Soon afterwards he announced he would be returning to the White House two weeks earlier than previously stated. Completion and aftermath The First Family returned to the White House on the evening of March 27, 1952. It was ready for its residents, but the work was not complete. Deficiencies included the main kitchen not being operable in time for a state visit; some rooms without electrical outlets; drafty fireplaces rendering rooms unfit to sleep in; and kitchen sinks were found to be too small for the dinner service.Klara, Pp.247-252 The project had to balance between the needs of the modern Presidency while retaining the symbolism of the nation's pre-eminent historic home, determine which historical style or period to adhere to, and implement these conflicting demands on a very tight budget. Prior to the reconstruction, the greatest historical link was through the house itself; the furnishings and most artwork were from recent decades. The reconstruction retained the historic exterior but removed most of the interior's link to the past. “When those floors creaked, you knew Lincoln had been walking there before you.”\\"Gutting the White House\\", Saturday Evening Post, February 16, 2011. Retrieved 2015-04-28 The reconstructed interiors were described as “stark” and by Eleanor Roosevelt as resembling a hotel.Klara, P.249 The Trumans both lobbied Congress to preserve the exterior of the White House and like the Eisenhowers and Kennedys who followed them, were not pleased with the lack of historical furniture. Before departing office, President Truman attempted to obtain an additional $50,000 from Congress for more suitable furniture, but was unsuccessful.Klara, P.257 Jacqueline Kennedy's restoration a decade later sought to restore this link through the return of historic furnishings, artwork, and interior details. Bess Truman was responsible for creating the Lincoln Bedroom by compiling into one room Lincoln's famous bed and other furniture from the time of his administration that had been discovered and restored by the Trumans.Phillips-Schrock, Patrick: \\"The White House - An Illustrated Architectural History\\", P. 72. McFarland & Company, Inc. 2013. To bring the White House's history closer to the people, President Truman conducted the first television tour of the White House on April 22, 1952 and opened the mansion to public tours; previously tours were only by way of Congressional appointments.McCullough, David: \\"Truman\\". New York, 1992. P.886 A significant effect the reconstructed house had on the lives of its occupants and on the operations of the presidency was due to air conditioning. Previously the operations of the White House and West Wing were significantly reduced as people departed the heat and humidity of the capital for more tolerable climes. Afterwards the White House could operate year-round without regard for summer heat.West, P.123 Neither the Commission nor the president were satisfied with the work of the general contractor. When the Commission published its official account of the project, it described the work of nearly everyone of significance to the project, except the general contractor, whose name was all but omitted.Klara, Pp.253-4 President Truman publicly expressed praise for the completed work, but the night of his return to the White House he wrote in his private diary: \\"With all the trouble and worry it is worth it – but not million dollars! if I could have had charge of the construction it would have been done for half the money and in half the time!\\"Margaret Truman, \\"Bess W.

It was established in 1770 and merged with Lędziny in 1991. At the end of 2014 it had 5,399 inhabitants.  History  The settlement was established in 1770 by about 300 Calvinists, fleeing religious persecution from the village of Kozy in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth across the border to Upper Silesia in the Kingdom of Prussia.A. Malina, Ewangelickie tradycje Hołdunowa, Didache, Katowice 2004. The refugees established a village on the fields of Lędziny's folwark Kiełpowy, called Anhalt, named after the rulers of a nearby Pless (Polish: Pszczyna). In 1778 they built a rectory, which housed a small chapel, school and lodging for a priest and a teacher. The village was affected by the discovery of underground coal deposits in 1842, which led to the opening of a coal mine in the following year. In 1902 the Protestant Saint Trinity church was built in the municipality (razed in 1967). It was then inhabited by a majority of German-speakers. In Upper Silesia plebiscite (1921) Germany got 294 votes against 76 for Poland.Results in Pszczyna County Nonetheless Hołdunów became a part of Poland. In the interwar period it was one of only four municipalities in the Upper Silesian (thus excluding Cieszyn Silesia) part of autonomous Silesian Voivodeship which had Protestant majority (70.6% in 1933). It was later annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II, and returned to Poland afterwards. In 1975 Hołdunów together with Lędziny were amalgamated with Tychy. Lędziny regained town rights in 1991 and absorbed Hołdunów.

He actively engaged with the Indian Independence Movement led by Gandhi.‘Nenerigina Siva Rao garu’ by Kakani Venkata Ratnam, Andhra Jyothi, 10 October 1966‘Two scholar Politicians’ by G. Krishna, Indian Express, 22 Jan 1972 Siva Rao's analyses and critiques of British colonial rule drew the attention of the rulers—some of his books and pamphlets were proscribed, and he was accused and tried for sedition in the 1930s. As a volunteer for the Indian National Congress, he was in charge of publicity for Krishna District. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the Salt Satyagraha. After Independence, he served on various government committees for the Telugu language. Siva Rao was active in the literary, cultural and intellectual scene of Andhra Pradesh and formed friendships with many of his contemporaries like Veluri Sivarama Sastry, Basavaraju Apparao, Viswanadha Satyanarayana, N. Gopi, and Narla Venkateswara Rao. Siva Rao was honoured by the Andhra Pradesh Government in 1966. The Andhra Pradesh History Congress honoured him twice. Family background and education Digavalli Venkata Siva Rao was born on 14 February 1898 to Venkataratnam and Suryamanikyamba in Kakinada, a town in what was then the British-occupation authority administered Madras Presidency. His grandfather, Digavalli Timmarazu (1794-1856), was the English Record Keeper from 1828 at the District Collector’s Office in Kakinada. He was also the Court of Wards Manager for Pithapuram estate and rose to the position of Huzur Serishtadar in 1850, which was the highest office a native officer was permitted by the East India Company to occupy. His administrative decisions were recorded in the Godavary District Manual. Siva Rao’s grandfather also constructed the Sri Bhimeswaraswami Temple at Kakinada in 1828. Siva Rao lost his father at a very early age and lived with his sister, Seetha Bai, and brother-in-law, Boddapati Purnayya. He studied at Calicut and Bangalore before joining, from 1910 to 1916 in Rajahmundry, the Hithakarini School which was founded by Kandukuri Veeresalingam (on whom Siva Rao was to later write a book). Thereafter, he studied intermediate (F. A.) and B. A. in Madras Presidency College from 1916-1920 and obtained a B. L. degree (1920-1922) from Madras Law College. Some of the students studying in various other faculties who were his hostel- mates during his time in Madras stayed in touch with him and would also become famous: M. Bhaktavatsalam, Avinashilingam Chettiar, Adavi Baapiraju, Koka Subba Rao, Yellapragada Subbarow, Velidandla Hanumantha Rao, and Kanuri Lakshmana Rao, to mention a few. Early literary activity Rajahmundry was a vibrant literary hub. Siva Rao’s literary talents were recognized early in the literary meetings he attended (along with Adavi Baapiraju) which were presided over by such luminaries as Kandukuri Veeresalingam, Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham, Chilukuri Veerabhadrarao, and others. During his Presidency College days in Madras, he won a Silver Medal in 1918 for his essay \\"Loyalty\\". He also received the Bourdillon Prize (including a cash reward of twenty rupees) of Presidency College for 1919-20. In 1922, he received the Powell and Morehead Prize (including a cash reward of 120 rupees) instituted by the College for his essay \\"Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu\\".Hendry John Allen, Principal, Presidency College, postcard dated 21 Mar 1918 He ran a handwritten-magazine called Andhra Vani during his Presidency College days. Professional, political and literary work 1922-1930: After he receiving his law degree in March 1922, Siva Rao set up a legal practice in Vijayawada while continuing his literary work. He made a special arrangement with the local Ramamohan Library to receive consignments of books from the Connemara Public Library in Madras. His publications began in 1927 with Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu. His historical study in Telugu, Dakshinafrika (South Africa, 1929) was dedicated to Gandhi, who knew no Telugu.

Gandhi, postcard dated 26 Feb 1927 Contribution to the Freedom Movement Siva Rao contributed to the Indian Independence Movement as a writer and historian, as well as professionally as a lawyer. He became a Congress volunteer. He translated into Telugu several Congress circulars from the leadership. He also devised formats to collect information on the prevailing economic conditions in villages. Volunteers collected this information on their visits and gave it to Siva Rao who compiled and analyzed the information. These analyses were then published in the Congress’ periodic bulletins. In 1933, he published Sahakara Vastu Nilayamu (Cooperative Stores), Bharatdesa Stithigatulu (Comparative Statistics in India), and Adhinivesha Swarajyamu (Dominion Status). The latter was widely acclaimed.Editorial in The Hindu dated 1933 These, and his other books written during this time, were intended to educate the public and Congress workers on political, economic and Constitutional matters. He was in charge of publicity for the Congress division of West Krishna District, and wrote many pamphlets, booklets and books, some of which he published on his own, while some were published by the District Congress. His analyses and critiques irked the British-occupation's \\"government\\", and some of his books and booklets were proscribed.Under the Press Regulation Ordinance, see Fort St George Gazette, 1932 Police searched his house and seized copies of Satyagraha Charitra, Nirbhagya Bharatamu, Satyagraha Vijayamu, Daridra Narayaneeyamu, and Satyagraha Bhumi. A sedition case was filed against him in 1930, which he contested and won on the grounds that there was no permission from the Governor in Council for his arrest. During the trial of his case, the circle inspector deposed in the court that Siva Rao was present in the Congress office whenever he went to arrest Congressmen and that he rendered legal advice for them and appeared as amicus curiae when they were produced in court. The second case against Siva Rao was filed in 1931 but was later withdrawn under the Gandhi-Irwin pact. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the Salt Satyagraha and produced in court. Some of them were the Gampalagudem Zamindar (Kotagiri Venkata Krishna Rao), N. G. Ranga, and Velidandla Hanumantha Rao. He compiled Congress activities in the Madras Province and sent the information for a chapter in the book The rise and growth of the Congress in India (1938) by C. F. Andrews and Girija Kanta Mookerjee. He condemned the police excesses during the civil disobedience movement and the questions raised by him were tabled in the Madras Legislative Assembly through his advocate friend from Mangalore, and Member of Legislative Council, U. C. Bhat. Siva Rao also worked in the Cooperative Store movement during this period. He was Secretary for Krishna Cooperative Stores and also Director of Andhra Cooperative Institute. He translated into Telugu the bye-laws and rules of Cooperative Society for Andhra and Gujarat which were printed and circulated. Siva Rao was also the President of Bar Association in the year 1947. Two of his books during that period were English-Telugu Technical and Scientific Dictionary (1934). It was approved by the Government's Textbook Committee. Three other well-noted books by him published during that period were British Rajyatantramu (1938), Enugula Veeraswamayya's Kasiyatra Charitra (1941), and Kadhalu-Gadhalu (in four parts, 1944–47). These four books were widely acclaimed. His edition of the travelogue Kasiyatra Charitra (the first two editions appeared in 1838 and 1860) involved considerable research and annotation of the archaic language of the original. For this, he went to the Oriental Manuscripts Library in Madras and studied the first two editions. His edition also incorporated a route map of the journey from Madras to Kasi. Hence he was given copyright to the work. While most of his writings were in Telugu, a few articles were also published in English during this period - Christianization of India (1940), and The Hindu Moslem Civilization of India (1941) were published in the bilingual magazine Amrutavani (\\"The Immortal Message\\"). Siva Rao was also instrumental in helping other writers to publish. He was closely associated with the Satavadhani Veluri Sivarama Sastry from the early 1920s. The poet had been unable to get his books published. In 1940, Siva Rao had the poet's Ekavali printed. Similarly, Basavaraju Apparao's book Apparao Geyalu was published posthumously at the instance of Siva Rao. Writings 1950-1987 Siva Rao's essays appeared in numerous (mostly Telugu) magazines. Prajamitra, Korada, Amrita Sandesham, Samadarsini, Grandhalaya Saraswamu, Vasumathi, Prabhatamu, Matrubhumi, Vijayavani, Jaminrytu, Samalochana, and Andhra Law Journal are some of the magazines which published his articles. He often also wrote for the popular daily newspapers: Andhra Patrika, Andhra Prabha, Andhra Jyothi, Andhra Bhumi, and Visalandhra. Ayyadevara Kaleswara Rao, a senior Congressman and Speaker of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly (1956–62) was an admirer and nominated Siva Rao as a member to many committees which he constituted and chaired during his tenure as Speaker—the Glossary Committee, Editorial Committee, Translation Committee, etc. After Kaleswara Rao's death in 1962, all those committees continued under P. V. Narasimha Rao who was the state's Education Minister. Under his chairmanship, the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi formed a three-member committee for microfilming of manuscripts with Siva Rao as a member. But soon Siva Rao resigned, first from Translation Committee protesting impositions of Hindi terms into Telugu. Later on he resigned from the remaining committees as well. Meanwhile, between 1983 (when he turned 85) until 1987, he published 55 articles. Research material for scholars Siva Rao had a considerable collection of documents as source material. Researchers who benefitted from the material included Kothapalli Veerabhadra Rao, Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao, Y. Vithal Rao, Bandi Gopal Reddy (Bangorey). Andhra Pradesh archives sent emissaries to Siva Rao to collect a few rare documents, some of which were on palm leaves. Several books have been dedicated to Siva Rao. Kavisamrat Dr. Viswanadha Satynarayana dedicated his novel Pralayanayadu (1960) which he wrote based on Siva Rao's study of the First War of Indian Independence, 1857 Poorvarangamulu. The historian Bangorey dedicated his book Brown Jabulu (1973) and Thatachari Kadhalu (1975) to Siva Rao. Others who dedicated their books to Siva Rao were N. Gopi and Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao. His last book, Veeresalingam Velugu Needalu (Veeresalingam: Light and Shadows, 1985), was a critical biography of the social reformer Kandukuri Veeresalingam, published when Siva Rao was 87 years old.

Fang received his education in Hong Kong, the United States and the United Kingdom. Before he became chief of UN Chinese interpretation section, he served in the UN as a simultaneous interpreter and was stationed in New York City and Geneva. In his later years, Fang suffered kidney disease. In 2011, he openly supported the prerequisite of being patriotic to China to be a popularly-elected Chief Executive of Hong Kong, while calling his sister Anson Chan, a pan-democrat, one of Hong Kong's \\"Gang of Four\\". Fang fell from his apartment on 3 November 2013 at the age of 72; he was suspected of committing suicide because of illness. Life Early years Philip Fang was born in Hong Kong on 28 March 1941. With ancestors from Shou County, Anhui, he was the fourth child of Fang Shin-hau (; 1913–1950) and Fang Zhaoling (1914–2006).Greenfield (1992), p.182. Fang's father was a textile merchant and the son of Fang Zhenwu (1885–1941), a well- known Kuomintang general who fought against the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. His mother was a Chinese painter and was apprenticed by Chao Shao-an and Chang Dai-chien. Sir Harry Fang (1923–2009), Shin-hau's younger brother, was a renowned orthopaedist, whose daughter Christine Fang () is a former chief executive of The Hong Kong Council of Social Service. Fang had seven siblings; his sister Anson Chan served as Chief Secretary of Hong Kong during British rule, and later as Chief Secretary for Administration as well as an elected Legislative Councillor of the Hong Kong SAR government under Chinese sovereignty.\\"Philip Fang's family dispute over mother's legacy\\" (5 November 2013) Overseas career Fang moved to mainland China with his family at a very young age to avoid war. They resettled in Hong Kong in 1948 due to political instability in the mainland. In 1950, his father Shin-hau died of illness and his family had to be dependent on his father's mother and brother. Fang received his secondary education at Wah Yan College, Hong Kong. He completed his secondary education in 1960 and went on to further his studies in the US. He pursued advanced studies at the University of Surrey in 1966, majoring in language. He graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree.Fang, Sir Harry (2002), p.89. Upon graduation from the University of Surrey, Fang joined the UN Interpretation Department in 1971 as a British subject. In the same year, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution to allow the People's Republic of China to replace the Republic of China as China's representative in the UN. Fang initially served in the UN Secretariat in New York City as a simultaneous interpreter.\\"Anson Chan's brother Philip Fang falls to death\\" (5 November 2013) In 1979, he was promoted to senior simultaneous interpreter at the UN Office at Geneva. He later worked as chief of the UN Chinese interpretation section. In 1999, he applied for early retirement to take care of his ageing mother Fang Zhaoling. In his twenty- eight years of service in the UN, Fang had been working and living abroad, including in New York and Geneva. His interpretation services primarily involved Chinese, English and Russian. Late years After his return to Hong Kong, Fang had been taking care of his ageing mother, until she died in 2006 at the age of 92. He became involved in a dispute with his siblings with regard to the allocation of some paintings and property left by his mother; In 2011, Philip and Fang Lam-sang (), his brother released a statement, accusing their brothers John and David of embezzling their mother's legacy. Anson Chan, their sister, tried to play the role of a mediator, but her siblings' relationships worsened. Furthermore, Fang was pro-Beijing, as opposed to his sister Anson, a pan-democrat. He rarely made public his views on politics but, in 2011, he wrote an open letter published in the South China Morning Post, supporting the criterion that the popularly-elected Chief Executive of Hong Kong must be patriotic to China.Fang, Phillip (20 September 2011)\\"Chief Executive should be patriotic, said Philip Fang\\" (6 November 2013) He even termed Anson, Martin Lee, Jimmy Lai and Joseph Zen as Hong Kong's \\"Gang of Four\\", and stated that the four as well as Audrey Eu-led Civic Party were challenging the SAR government. The letter sparked media attention.\\"Death of Philip Fang Shun-sang, brother of Anson Chan Fang On-sang\\" (5 November 2013) In his late years, Fang suffered from mood disorder as he was affected by his kidney disease and the death of his mother. He received medical treatment in Sydney and thereafter lived alone at Tung Chung in Hong Kong. Fang fell from his 16th-storey apartment at around HKT 21:00, 3 November 2013. He was brought to Yan Chai Hospital and pronounced dead an hour later, at the age of 72. He was suspected of committing suicide by jumping off his residence because of illness.\\"Philip Fang commits suicide\\" (5 November 2013) After his death, his brothers went to Kwai Chung Public Mortuary to identify him.\\"Philip Fang's medical condition similar to that of Leslie Cheung\\" (6 November 2013) A low- profile Catholic funeral was conducted on 10 November 2013 at the Hong Kong Funeral Home with around seventy members of the Fang clan attending.

He married Cynthia Fong, a Chinese American, with whom he had two daughters. Fang lived alone in Hong Kong in his later years while his wife and daughters stayed in the United States. After his death, his wife and one of his daughters attended his funeral in Hong Kong; his other daughter was unable to attend as she was heavily pregnant.

He is mostly remembered for his television themes and is credited as writing a total of 241. He also composed under the pseudonym John Snow.  Childhood  Derek Hilton was born on 3 February 1927 at a modest terraced house in York Street, Whitefield, near Bury, Lancashire. The son of Alfred Redvers Hilton, a keen amateur operatic singer, and Emily, a Shropshire girl in service as a maid, Derek began piano lessons at six-years old. Showbusiness had fired his imagination after visiting the music hall at Bury Hippodrome, where he recalled the spotlights transforming the dingy hall into a pink and magical palace. 'When I was nine or ten I used to make stages and put tiny musicians on them,' he said. 'I always wanted to play music.’  Experience  By fourteen years of age Derek was leading his band 'The Rhythmic Blue Notes' on the accordion, as well as becoming a founder member of Besses o' th' Barn Brass Band on the trombone. Conscripted at 18, he joined the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and persuaded his officers at Berwick- on-Tweed that he was more useful playing the piano in the Mess than out on the parade ground. Next came postings to Italy, Austria, Germany and France with \\"Stars in Battledress\\" alongside Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. Working with stars including Gracie Fields, Kay Kendall and Richard Tauber as pianist and arranger gave him invaluable experience in jotting down parts at high speed for each night's performance. Derek playing in a band in 1950 In Germany Derek met his first wife Mary Witsenburg, a Dutch girl stranded in Hamburg throughout the war and they married in London in 1949. There followed a busy time touring as pianist with orchestras and leaders such as Johnny Dankworth and Sonny Rose, eventually spending three happy years working in dance bands in Jersey. After settling back in Manchester in 1953, he taught at the Regional Schools of Music led by Johnny Roadhouse at Decibel Studios, Oxford Road.  Big Break  Hilton's big break came when his trio provided the music at the Press Reception for the newly launched Granada TV in 1956. A few weeks later, Derek was called in to play 'Mountain Greenery' on 'Spot the Tune' leading to a permanent spot. Soon Derek's professionalism led to his regularly playing at two shows a day, five days a week: ‘Sharp at Four’ and ‘People and Places’ at 6 pm. The Derek Hilton Trio, originally with Derek at the piano, Bob Duffy on bass and Bob Turner at the drums were a staple of Granada’s ‘People and Places’, exchanging sardonic repartee with presenter Billy Grundy. The line-up changed over time to Amos Smith on drums and finally to Dave Lynane on bass and Dave Hassall as drummer. From 1963 – 1964 The Derek Hilton Trio were also resident musicians at Manchester nightclub Mr Smiths. By 1963 Derek had composed, arranged or played more than 500 TV themes. As musical director at Granada TV Derek is credited with writing the highest number of television themes in the United Kingdom – a total of 241.

Other credits are incidental music for Sherlock Holmes, Inspector Morse, and Brideshead Revisited. To the general viewer Derek was perhaps best known for re-recording and re-arranging the Coronation Street theme in 1972 and accompanying Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) at the piano when she sang on the show. He was also a regular at the keyboard at The Wheeltapper's and Shunter's Social Club where he was the MD overseeing 'the turns.' A passionate Bury FC fan, in 1972 Derek wrote Bury's anthem Aye, aye, Up the Shakers sung by The Bury Tones which was for many years a rousing anthem for Shakers fans. De Wolfe Music contains several of Derek's' library tracks which are available currently.  Personal life  After thirty-two years with Granada, Derek retired, though continuing to write music, for the stage play Feed and as Musical Director on P & O and Cunard cruise ships. He was married twice, the second time to Valerie George, whom he later divorced. Hilton died on 11 July 2005 and leaves three daughters from his first marriage, Marijke Snell, Lorraine Howell, a designer and Martine Bailey, a writer.

Eastward, where this peneplain dips below Cambrian and other Lower Paleozoic cover rocks. The exposed parts of this peneplain are extraordinarily flat with relief of less than 20 m. The overlying cover rocks demonstrate that the peneplain was flooded by shallow seas during the Early Paleozoic. Being the oldest identifiable peneplain in its area the Sub-Cambrian peneplain qualifies as a primary peneplain. The surface was first identified Arvid Högbom in a 1910 publication with Sten Rudberg producing in 1954 the first extensive map. This mapping has been improved upon by Karna Lidmar-Bergström since the 1980s. Extent The Sub-Cambrian peneplain extends as an almost continuous belt along the eastern coast of Sweden for some 700 km from north to south. Near Stockholm and Hudiksvall the peneplain is densely dissected by joint valleys and at the High Coast is the Sub-Cambrian peneplain is both highly uplifted and eroded. More inland the peneplain can be traced at the crestal region of the South Swedish Dome where it is dissected by joint valleys. The Sub- Cambrian peneplain in the crestal region of the South Swedish Dome is the highest step in a piedmonttreppen system seen in Småland. In southern Sweden the peneplain surfaces tilt away from the crest of South Swedish Dome, to the northwest in Västergötland, to the northeast in Östergötland and to the east in eastern Småland. At this last region the sub-Cambrian peneplain is truncated to the west by a well defined and prominent scarp that separates it from the South Småland peneplain to the west. Much of the Hardangervidda plateau in the Norway is believed to be an uplifted part of the peneplain In the Central Swedish lowland the peneplain extends further west being 450 km wide from west to east. In Bohuslän, at the northern end of the Swedish West Coast, there is some uncertainty over whether the hilltops are remnants of the peneplain. A similar situation occurs in central Halland. Further west, parts of the Paleic surface in Norway have been interpreted to be part of the peneplain that has been tectonically uplifted and is apparently disrupted by NNE-SSW trending faults. Near the 1,100 m high Hardangervidda plateau in Norway is the Sub-Cambrian peneplain has been uplifted at least thousand meters, albeit Hardangervidda itself is part of a much younger peneplain formed in the Miocene epoch. At Stöttingfjället in northern Sweden the peneplain occur, as result of tectonic uplift, at about 650 meters giving origin to a series of water gaps including those of Ångermanälven, Indalsälven and Ljusnan. Blå Jungfrun, an inselberg and island formed in connection to the peneplain. In northwestern Finland the Ostrobothnian Plain is a continuation of the peneplain. To the east the Sub-Cambrian peneplain continues as an unconformity beneath the East European Platform. On a grand-scale the peneplain is not completely flat as it has been deformed. This deformation is an isostatic response to erosion and the load of Phanerozoic sediments that rests above much of the peneplain. The peneplain is characterized by a general lack of inselbergs. One exception to this is the island Blå Jungfrun in the Baltic Sea which is an ancient inselberg formed in Precambrian time and buried in sandstone after its formation. Blå Jungfrun remained buried until erosion of the East European Platform freed it in geologically recent times. Origin Interpretations of Jotnian sandstone imply that much of the Baltic Shield have had faint relief since the Mesoproterozoic, but no exhumed peneplain from this period has been preserved. The low relief terrain on which the Jotnian sandstone deposited was disturbed by the Sveconorwegian orogeny in western Sweden about 1,000 million years ago and then begun to erode again into a terrain of subdued relief. The peneplain formed after 600 million years ago but prior to the Cambrian trangression. The basement rocks forming the peneplain surface were exhumed from depths were the temperature was in excess of 100° C prior to the formation of peneplain. Karna Lidmar-Bergström and co- workers assume the peneplain formed through a cycle of erosion with a preceding brief valley phase and that it grades down to a former sea level. Due to the absence of land vegetation in Precambrian times sheet wash is thought to have been an important process of erosion leading to the formation of extensive pediments. Sheet wash would also have hindered the formation of deep weathering profiles. Indeed, at the places the substrate of the Sub- Cambrian peneplain is kaolinized it never exceeds a few meters in depth. Sedimentary rock cover Limestone stacks of Byrum's raukar in Öland laterally close to the exhumed parts of the peneplain and also close to the buried parts of the peneplain. The flatness of the peneplain meant that during the Cambrian transgression very large areas were swiftly flooded forming large and shallow inland seas in changing configurations. The new relief formed on top of Cambrian sediments smoothed out irregularities in the peneplain. Early Cambrian sandstones overlying the peneplain in southern Norway, Scania and Bornholm have likely never been recycled. This means the parent rocks of the sandstone were eroded and the sediment strongly reworked and weathered reaching sedimentary maturity with no other in-between step or hiatus. The source areas for these sandstones are local rocks from the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt or the Sveconorwegian and Gothian orogens.

Nonetheless, its economy is still predominantly led by small-scale merchandise trade, services, agriculture, and small-scale cottage industries. In particular, the livelihood of a sizable number of its residents still rely on production and marketing of traditional alcoholic drinks called \\"Tella\\" and \\"Arekie\\". In fact, the traditional \\"Arekie\\" of Merawi is a popular brand alcohol being widely traded in north-western parts of Ethiopia such as Bahir Dar, Gondar, Humera, and Metema, and is said to be smuggled into the Sudan.

Bahir Dar University's extension programs are quite popular in the town. The town has a few number of private and public health clinics, one public health center and one public hospital.  Transportation  The town enjoys Minibuses almost every next half hour to Bahir Dar.

Norrland terrain () is a geomorphic unit covering the bulk of Norrland and the northwestern half of Svealand. Except for The High Coast the coastal areas of Norrland do not belong to the Norrland terrain. The southern and eastern boundary of the Norrland terrain is made up of geological faults that disrupt the Sub-Cambrian peneplain found the lowlands. In some locations these faults have been extensively eroded making the Norrland terrain boundary partly a result of erosion.

These forests are known in Sweden as Norra barrskogsregionen (lit. the northern conifer forest region). The southern boundary of the Norrland terrain was identified as a major phytogeographical boundary by Rutger Sernander. For example, the boundary coincides with the northernmost extension of natural grown oaks. The phytogeographical boundary is not fully sharp as valleys of the Norrland terrain constitute transition zones for vegetation. Till and peat are the overwhelmingly commonest soil types.

The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what would later be known as Upper Silesia. In 1321 appears the German name of the village, Tymendorf, which eventually evolved into Timmendorf. A Catholic parish was established in the early years of the village. It was mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among the parishes of Żory Deanery as Tunsdorff. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Racibórz, within feudally fragmented Poland. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurzó family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Ssiroka. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the kingdom of Prussia, including the village. After World War I in the Upper Silesia plebiscite 620 inhabitants voted in favour of joining Poland, against 22 for Germany.Results in Pszczyna County It became later a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

It includes 15 different municipalities: Monsagro, El Maíllo, Serradilla del Arroyo, La Alberca, El Cabaco, Nava de Francia, Mogarraz, Herguijuela de la Sierra, Monforte de la Sierra, Madroñal, Cepeda, Villanueva del Conde, Miranda del Castañar and Sotoserrano San Martin del Castañar was added on 18 December 2008. Ecosystems Wildlife The park covers a vast area covering part of the Sierra de Francia and the Batuecas valley within it, a place that also gives its name to the park. This is where most of the wildlife and flora are present in the area, and where some of the most unusual Spanish biodiversity can be seen. The black stork is the jewel of the park, and has a small colony which is an essential value for being a bridge between existing populations in the Arribes del Duero Natural Park and those living in Extremadura. Other birds present in the park includes common cuckoo, red-legged partridge, woodpigeon, European turtle dove, European robin, reed bunting, common blackbird, Iberian grey shrike, grey wagtail and white wagtail and the Eurasian blue tit. Flora The region of the Sierra de Francia is formed by an intricate depression covered by the Alagón River. Within it there are two hidden rough and rugged valleys, which provide places of safe haven and perfect hiding, but this also creates an oppressive narrowness.

Built in 2000, it is one of the most exclusive hotels and the first Aman Resort on the African continent. It has a 21-hole course, a well-stocked library and an outdoor swimming pool set amidst hibiscus bushes. In May 2015, David Beckham celebrated his 40th birthday at the hotel. Background Amanjena is situated in Marrakesh's Palmeraie, along the road to Ouarzazate, just outside Morocco’s UNESCO-protected city of Marrakech in an area where the river valleys of Draa and Dadès merge with the Sahara desert. The resort is set in the backdrop of a hill which rises to a height of , in the surroundings of an olive orchard of the Almoravid period. There are views of the Atlas Mountains. The 2010 movie Sex and the City 2 was filmed at Amanjena. In May 2015, David Beckham celebrated his 40th birthday at the hotel, along with guests Gordon Ramsay and Tana Ramsay, David Gardner and Liv Tyler, the Spice Girls, Eva Longoria, Tom Cruise, David Blaine, Guy Ritchie and Vanessa Feltz. Architecture Amanjena was designed by architect Ed Tuttle, and built over a period of two years. The Moorish architecture is in the Arabic/Moroccan traditional style, consisting of 32 pavilions and seven houses (\\"maisons\\"), with contemporary interiors. The design incorporates the Moorish building practice of pise, packed-earth structures, such as is incorporated in the nearby Berber village structures. The colour scheme matches the Red City buildings of Marrakesh. The structure is of stone, pale peach in color, with pink, honey and sage green paint colors used throughout the building. The massive entry door emulates that of an ancient Arab civilization. Amanjena has a very large lobby in the Moorish style, and features jade-coloured fountains. The lobby is patterned on the lines of a caravanserai, an Ogres suggestive of the Mezquita, the Mosque of Cordoba, with colonnades which open into water fronts. Other features include, sandy clay roofing, two-storeyed lounges, internal patios which face fountains, arches, chiselled pillars, glazed Moroccan tiles, and a frieze of ziggurat design. Various decorating techniques are used, such as écaille de poisson for the zellige and plâtre ciselé for the walls. The rooms have high ceilings and are furnished with Berber carpets and lanterns. Eight of the pavilions have their own private garden oasis and pool, while six overlook the main pool. The maisons are modeled on the typical Moroccan townhouse.

The castle is located in the Princely Capital City of Płock, Masovian Voivodeship; in Poland. History The castle is located on a steep Vistulan hillside, most likely since the eleventh century, a wooden fortress - defended by walls and dikes, where in the middle there was a small stone built stronghold. On the turning point of the eleventh and twelfth century, when one of the largest Masovian strongholds where already located on the hillside - a chapel and wall-defended living quarters were built in 1194. At the end of the thirteenth century, the raising of the castle had begun, when the stronghold was fortified, and took on its current form under the reign of Casimir III the Great. The expansion of the castle was done on the hillside of the former stronghold, which was reconstructed with bricks and expanded, the stronghold was also raised with two towers. The castle was built in square-shaped complex. In the south-west of the complex, the Szlachecka Tower was raised - with a squared base and lower half; and an octagonal upper half. In the northern part of the castle, by a Romanesque building, there is a clock tower. The castle's courtyard is closed off by the north-western, eastern and southern wing. The castle is fortificated by a double encirclement of defensive walls - securing the stronghold and Płock, being just outside the castle's walls. The castle was a residence of the Masovian Dukes up until the fifteenth century. Due to a partial removal of the hillside, in 1532, the castle suffered damage, which was rebuilt. In 1538, the Masovian dukes had resided in the newly built palace, outside the castle walls, allowing the castle complex to be given to the Benedictines. During the times of the wars against the Swedes, the castle was severely damaged, first in 1657, and then in 1705. After the castle's reconstruction, the castle complex became a Baroque architectural style Benedictine Abbey, which existed until 1781. When after the Partitions of Poland, Prussia took over the castle, the authorities ordered some of the defensive walls to be deconstructed. From 1865, the castle hosted spiritual seminars. After World War II, the castle was renovated, and since 1973, the castle houses a museum.

It was an independent village but was, as a part of gmina Gardawice, administratively merged into Orzesze in 1975. It has an area of 18.7 km² and about 1,230 inhabitants.  History  It is the oldest settlement on the territory of Orzesze. According to a chronicle from the 16th century, a local Catholic parish was established already in the 11th century. The village was mentioned several times in the 13th century, due to a Cistercian monastery which was to be raised in the village in 1237, which was foiled by the First Mongol invasion of Poland in 1241. Eventually it was never finished (instead the monastery was built in Rudy Raciborskie). It was then mentioned in 1326 in the register of Peter's Pence payment among Catholic parishes of Oświęcim deanery of the Diocese of Kraków as Woskic. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurzó family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the village was mentioned as Wossticzeo. The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In the Thirty Years War the village was completely destroyed and ceased to function. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia, including the village. After World War I in the Upper Silesia plebiscite 186 out of 299 inhabitants voted in favour of joining Poland, against 113 for Germany. It became later a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Second Polish Republic. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

The Museum has been created by Donato Cascione and it’s managed by the homonym cultural association.  Structure  The museum currently covers an area of 500 m²: in its definitive layout the current surface will be doubled and it will be completed with the workshops, where young people can learn the ancient trades (cartapestaio, potter, basket-maker, etc.). The museum is composed by several residences, connected for exhibition purpose. The first environment reproduces a \\"lamione\\", a built ambient (16th century) that extends the volume of a pre-existing cave (house cave): it allowed the family to separate from the beasts during the night. The Sassi population was constituted for the 70% by peasants; the remaining 30% were artisans that carried out innumerable handicraft activities aimed to satisfy the local demand. Commercial exchanges, in fact, were very limited for the lack of suitable infrastructures. Most of the exhibition rooms are dedicated to these artisans’ shops that once existed in the ancient town. Furthermore, there are exhibition rooms representing daily-life places, typical of this agricultural-pastoral society (public wine cellars), and testimonies related to themes connected to the South-Italy history (brigandage, childhood).  Outfitting  The preparation of the exhibition halls has been preceded by years of targeted gathering of daily use objects and tools from various jobs that were the foundation of the economic and social life in the Sassi town. A fundamental criterion has inspired the setting out of the environments: the museum didn’t have to be a cold exposition of objects but a reconstruction of environments as close as possible to reality. The operational phase of the preparation, has been preceded by the study of the most meaningful texts of the \\"peasant literature\\", and it has been supported by the enthusiastic consultation of seniors, which lived this history themselves and whose testimony is full of details from personal experience.

There are different cultural activities that the Association carries out in its territory, always finalized to the involvement of the youth (team works, production of didactic material, dramatizations, publications of testimonies, etc.).  Workshop  Recently a first artistic workshop has been activated, finalized to different expressive activities: production of graphic-pictorial material, ceramics decoration, clay and wood working. The artifacts are reproductions of objects connected to the life in the Sassi, as well as representations of life-situations typical of the agricultural- pastoral society. The workshop allows the organization of innumerable didactic activities that involve students of schools of every order and degree.  Publications  The association collected the result of its own ethnographical researches (testimonies, photos, documents) in a publication, \\"Tales from the Museum\\", now to its third edition. The association also produced a CD-ROM that allows the virtual tour of the exhibition halls, a booklet about the water-harvesting systems in Matera from Neolithic to the first half of the 20th century, and a guidebook to the Museum.

Production Squid fishing has accounted for about 75% of the total yield of 200,000 tonnes, which is exported to Europe and the Far East. The other 25% includes finfish species such as Rock Cod, Hake, Hoki and Toothfish. Brown trout fishing is common, and fish caught can be particularly sizable; the record for the largest sea trout caught in the Falklands is held by Alison Faulkner at 22lbs 12.5 oz (roughly 10. 3 kg). D. gahi squid is exclusively fished in the island waters. The average annual revenue from fisheries is reported to be £20 million though during the recent years annual yields have declined to £12-15 million. Loligo gahi is an important squid species fished in the eastern and southern part called the \\"Falkland Shelf\\", in an area known as the \\"Loligo box\\". The island is reported to have 20 ocean going fishing vessels and is capable of meeting 10% requirement of squid fishes in the world. There are special squid jigging vessels which can fish Illex argentinus squid. Trawlers are used for fishing Doryteuthis (gahi squid) are under the joint ownership of Falklands and European companies. Korean trawlers have fished here and found about 12 species of skates and rays which include Bathyraja griseocauda, Bathyraja albomaculata, Bathyraja brachyurops and Dipturus chilensis.

He dedicated it to his friend, the conductor and BBC music producer, Edward Clark. A performance takes about 10½ minutes. The movements are marked: # Moderato # Quasi lento # Rondo. Ritmico, non troppo allegro The term sonatina has no single strict definition, but is rather a title applied by the composer to a piece in basic sonata form which is shorter and lighter in character, or technically more elementary, than a typical sonata. The Rondo was used as a test piece in the 1928 Daily Express Piano Competition, which was won by Cyril Smith. It had been recorded by William Murdoch as a guide to competitors. Lewis Foreman has written, \\"that Ireland even then recognised the piano not only for its romantic and singing qualities, but also - almost Bartók like - as a percussion instrument\\".

It was directed by Wilfred Jackson and produced by Walt Disney. It introduces the character of Mortimer Mouse. It was the 84th Mickey Mouse short film to be released, the fifth of that year. Plot Mickey Mouse is by his sentient car, getting ready for his girlfriend, Minnie as they are having a picnic together, just the two of them. But then, a Spanish mouse named Mortimer, who drives a sleek sports car (who is also sentient), rushes by and stops. Mortimer Mouse is one of Minnie's old friends who is also known as the rival of Mickey Mouse. He backs up and crashes his car into Mickey's car, pushing it into a tree. Mortimer starts to make fun of his short rival, making Mickey jealous. He takes two of his buttons from his shorts off. One button is hidden in Mickey's hand whilst the other button is thrown away. Mickey grumpily tries to grab Mortimer's buttons from his long trousers, but they electrocute him (revealed to be connected to batteries) making him even more jealous. Then, Mickey's car pushes Mortimer's sports car off and tries to scare it away by rattling its engine, but Mortimer's sports car loudly honks its horn, scaring Mickey's car, making it hide behind a rock nearby. Afterwards, Minnie, Mortimer, and Mickey, who is still grumpy about Mortimer, are all having a picnic together. Then Mortimer sees a bull in a nearby pen and tries to impress Minnie by doing some bullfighting. He grabs the red picnic blanket, causing Mickey to have his nose caught on a doughnut like a ring, to use to fight the bull. Mickey jealously pulls it off, then becomes a bit nervous as Minnie applauds Mortimer and asks Mickey he is good. But Mickey pouts at Minnie, breaks a teacup and storms off back to his old car. Minnie is shocked about Mickey's jealous behavior, but she only says behind Mickey's back: \\"You're just jealous.\\" Mickey and his car both sit next to each other, where they both kick a rock while feeling jealous and grumpy about being teased by Mortimer and his car. Meanwhile, Mortimer is still doing his bullfighting thing. His first two attempts went well, mostly by making the bull charge into the fences around its pen, but when Mortimer sees the pen's gate open and as he's about to do a third one, he immediately yelps, runs away and flees in his sports car, leaving Minnie to deal with the bull alone after dropping the blanket over her. The bull chases Minnie, who runs away with the blanket still over her. Mickey and his car notice this and, while Mickey's car hides again, Mickey manages to stop the bull, getting stuck under it in the process while Minnie runs up a tree. Mickey bites the bull's tail, making it jump and allowing him to get out. While trying to help Minnie, the bull charges at them again. Mickey manages to get out of the way as it rams into the tree, making Minnie fall back down before she immediately climbs back up. Mickey then fights the bull with the red blanket only to get wrapped up in it and is unable to run fast enough to get away. He does manage to avoid the bull by grabbing a branch with his mouth but is forced to run again (this time by crawling like a caterpillar) when the bull turns around. Mickey's car suddenly sees his owner in danger and saves him by pushing the bull aside, but the bull immediately begins chasing the car. The car once again hides while the bull turns its attention back to Mickey. His car quickly saves Mickey again by biting the bull's tail and getting it to chase it using its red taillight, tiring it out. After luring the bull towards it again, it then uses its back wheels to splash mud over the bull. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to get a still frightened Minnie down from the tree, only for them to both fall. Mickey's car catches them with the bull still in pursuit. It then creates a cloud of dust around the bull, confusing it and allowing them to escape. While on their way home, Mickey asks Minnie if Mortimer is still funny. Minnie politely denies this and they both shake hands, resulting in the two making up.

It is a colonial species native to the Indo-Pacific region where it occurs in shallow water. It was first described by the American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill in 1866 as Goniastrea aspera but it has since been determined that it should be in a different genus and its scientific name has been changed to Coelastrea aspera. This is a common species throughout much of its wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Colonies of Coelastrea aspera are either encrusting or massive. The surface has a honeycomb-like appearance, the corallites being cerioid (several polyps sharing a common wall) in arrangement, deep and angular, with thick, straight walls. The septa are even, with long and short septa alternating in larger corallites. Budding is usually intratentacular (inside the ring of tentacles). The paliform lobes, visible through the tissues, are large and broad in protected environments but much smaller in colonies occupying exposed positions. On intertidal flat rocks, several colonies in close proximity may form a level expanse several metres across. The general colour of this coral is usually pale brown and the oral discs may be a contrasting colour, often cream. Distribution Coelastrea aspera is native to the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from Madagascar and the Red Sea, through the Indian Ocean to Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the East China Sea, and the western and central Pacific Ocean. It occurs on reef flats, on reef slopes and in lagoons, at depths down to about . Ecology Coelastrea aspera is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Packets of eggs and sperm are normally released into the water column and, being buoyant, rise to the surface. Here the packets break up and cross-fertilisation can take place with gametes from different colonies intermixing. The larvae remain near the surface for a few days. In a rather different forms of sexual reproduction, it has been found that on some occasions, the eggs and developing larvae are brooded in the maternal polyps. Some individual colonies have even been seen adopting both breeding strategies at the same time in different parts of the colony. C. aspera is a zooxanthelate coral. In its tissues it contains symbiotic unicellular photosynthetic organisms that provide nutrients and energy for the coral host. The coral in return provides a protective environment and a supply of carbon dioxide for the zooxanthellae. Under conditions of stress, usually high water temperature or excessive solar radiation, the coral expels some or all of these symbionts, a condition known as coral bleaching. In Thailand in 1995, in a reef flat dominated by C. aspera, there was a mass bleaching event caused by high water temperatures. Researchers found that the east side of each coral was bleached while the west side was unaffected. They hypothesized that the corals \\"remembered\\" a previous bleaching event caused by solar radiation and had built in some defences on the affected side. In 2000, they detached a number of colonies and rotated them through 180°, and when a further severe bleaching event occurred in 2010, the researchers took samples to assess the number of zooxanthellae present on each side of these corals and in controls. They found that the rotated corals had significantly higher levels (four times as many) of zooxanthellae in the affected areas than unrotated corals. This demonstrated that the previously affected areas had developed coping strategies and had a \\"memory\\" of at least ten years.

The SSA programme is split into three main segments: * Space weather (SWE) segment: monitoring the Sun, the solar wind, and in Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere, that can affect spaceborne and ground-based infrastructure or endanger human life or health * Near-Earth objects (NEO) segment: detecting natural objects, such as asteroids and comets, which can potentially impact Earth * Space surveillance and tracking (SST) segment: Tracking active and inactive satellites and space debris (collectively these items are referred to as Resident Space Objects (RSOs)). The SSA programme is being implemented as an optional ESA programme with financial participation by 14 Member States. The programme started in 2009 and its mandate was extended until 2019. The second phase of the programme received €46.5 million for the 2013–2016 period. Space weather segment The main objective of the space weather segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of space weather events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere. These include the PROBA2 satellite and the Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the ESTRACK Redu Station and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in Belgium. Near-Earth object segment The near-Earth object segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential Earth impactors and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the OGS Telescope, that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities, including the NEOSTEL flyeye telescope due for completion in 2020. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the ESA Centre for Earth Observation, Italy. Space surveillance and tracking segment The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on- orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing radio and optical telescopes, with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris. The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include: * Surveillance ** Northern Cross transient radio telescope located at the Medicina Radio Observatory, serving as a receiver in bistatic radar system ** RAF Fylingdales's three face AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning phased array radar, serving as a monostatic system ** French Air Force bistatic radar-based space surveillance system GRAVES * Tracking ** CAMRa 25-meter steerable parabolic dish S-band radar located at the Chilbolton Observatory ** EISCAT scatter radar capable of 3D monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere ** TIRA 34-meter parabolic dish with an L-band tracking radar and a Ku-band imaging radar SSA SST optical surveillance and tracking assets include: * Surveillance ** OLS telescope at the Observatorio Astronómico de Mallorca ** Starbrook and Starbrook north located at RAF Troodos ** Fabra-ROA telescope (TFRM) at Serra del Montsec ** ZimSMART robotic telescope * Tracking ** Satellite laser ranging station Graz at Lustbühel Observatory ** Matera Laser Ranging Observatory (MLRO) in Italy ** OGS Telescope at the Teide Observatory ** TAROT and TAROT-South robotic telescope at the La Silla Observatory ** ZIMLAT telescope at the Zimmerwald Observatory ** ESA Flyeye Telescope at Sicily, Italy As part of the SSA Programme new, dedicated surveillance radar supported by optical sensors systems will be developed. The segment is coordinated by the Space Surveillance Test & Validation (SSTC) Centre located at the ESAC in Spain. Close approaches of Near-Earth objects and near earth asteroids are reported by ESA through the space situational awareness center.

Mihalik has also been a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Detroit Lions and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). College career In his freshman season in 2011, Mihalik had six tackles and two pass breakups, playing the last nine games of the season. He played nine games as a sophomore in 2012, registering 22 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, and a sack. As a junior in 2013, he recorded 22 tackles, including six for loss and two sacks. In his 2014 senior season, Mihalik tallied 27 tackles, including 4.5 tackles for a loss, and 3.5 sacks. Professional career Pre-draft Mihalik was projected to go undrafted during the 2015 NFL Draft by some analysts. Although he had amazing size and length, many were hampered by his athletic ability, strength, and awareness. Philadelphia Eagles Mihalik was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 2015 NFL Draft with the 237th overall pick. Mihalik was signed to the practice squad after failing to make the 53-man roster, but was released on September 16. Pittsburgh Steelers After being released, Mihalik was signed to a futures contract by the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 20, 2016. Despite spending his collegiate career as a defensive end and having no prior experience, the Steelers chose to move him to offensive tackle.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria, O'Mullane was a standout cricketer from an early age, and came to be regarded as his colony's premier wicket-keeper. During the winter months, he excelled as a footballer in the nascent Australian game, receiving praise for his courage and strength. O'Mullane's promising career was cut short when he died of tuberculosis, aged 24. Family and early years Portrait of Elizabeth O’Mullane and her children by William Strutt, c. 1852, National Gallery of Victoria. George is pictured far right with a bow and arrow. O'Mullane was born in Melbourne on 3 December 1842, of Anglo-Celtic descent. He was one of five siblings. His father, Dr. Arthur O'Mullane of Cork, Ireland, graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Glasgow in 1838. The following year, he arrived in Australia's Port Phillip District aboard the William Metcalfe on 15 November, along with Miss Maria Elizabeth Barber, formerly of Keyingham near Hull, Yorkshire, whom he married in 1840. They settled in Melbourne, and Arthur established himself as a leading physician in the fledgling port city, taking up government and medical positions, and was one of the first honorary physicians elected to the Melbourne Hospital. He took up land speculation and became part-owner of the Port Phillip Gazette in the 1840s, and in 1852, purchased the Bourke Street residence of Sir Redmond Barry, the famous Supreme Court Judge and founder of the State Library of Victoria. Around this time, Elizabeth O'Mullane and her children, including George, were depicted in a family portrait by colonial artist William Strutt, now held at the National Gallery of Victoria. George, along with his brother Arthur, attended the Melbourne Grammar School, and each successively captained the school's cricket team. One of their classmates, John Conway, also excelled at cricket, and would go on to play for Victoria alongside George.\\"Cricket. The M.C.C. v. The Church of England Grammar School\\".

O'Mullane represented Victoria against H. H. Stephenson's XI, the first English cricket team to tour Australia. It was during these matches against the English that O'Mullane's abilities as a cricketer were first widely recognised, and it was remarked that he played \\"as coolly as a veteran.\\"\\"Cricket. The Past Season\\". The Australasian (Melbourne). 15 June 1867. p. 12. Retrieved 3 May 2016. O'Mullane was reported as being \\"up country\\" when George Parr's All-England Eleven was in Melbourne during the 1863–64 season, and therefore missed out on playing against the tourists. When several professional members of the Victoria XI defected to New South Wales ahead of the December 1865 intercolonial match between the two colonies, O'Mullane was selected to play for Victoria at the insistence of its captain, Tom Wills. O'Mullane put in a career-best performance behind the wickets and ended on 33 not out in a thrilling partnership with Wills, who scored the first half century in intercolonial cricket (58), leading Victoria to an against-the-odds win.\\"Sporting Notes\\".

O'Mullane played in his last club cricket match in October 1866. A left-handed batsman, O'Mullane played without any pretense to style according to cricketer and journalist William Hammersley, but \\"was a hard, determined hitter ... a very fast run-getter, and fond of taking liberties with the bowling.\\" He was not the most elegant wicket-keeper, but \\"hard as nails\\", unflinching and equally good on the leg side as on the off.

As a captain, wrote The Australasian, O'Mullane was prone to causing disputes with an \\"energy of character\\" that was not always \\"tempered by tact and discretion\\".

Football As a schoolboy, O'Mullane played in the famous 1858 match between Melbourne Grammar and Scotch College, commemorated by this statue outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Tom Wills is depicted umpiring behind two students contesting the football. In August 1858, O'Mullane played for Melbourne Grammar against Scotch College in what is claimed by some to be the first match of Australian rules football. This 40-a-side contest, played over three consecutive Saturdays on the Richmond Paddock next to the Melbourne Cricket Ground, ended in a draw with each team scoring one goal. One spectator recalled:Olympus (15 September 1892). \\"Sport and Play\\", Melbourne Punch (Melbourne). p. 11. Retrieved 4 May 2016. While O'Mullane represented several football clubs during his career (as was common in those days), including St Kilda and Melbourne, he is most often associated with South Yarra. Apart from being a standout player, O'Mullane also worked as a club administrator and umpired matches between other teams. In May 1866, when the code was updated at a meeting of eight club delegates chaired by H. C. A. Harrison, O'Mullane was one of two players appointed to represent South Yarra. In September of that year, in his last match, he captained the club to victory against Melbourne to gain permanent possession of the Challenge Cup. The club's fortunes declined soon after his death four months later and South Yarra folded at the start of 1873, having not won a match since 1868. O'Mullane \\"loved nothing more than a rough, tough, energetic game\\", and it was said that only Tom Wills could match his \\"pluck and skill\\" as a footballer. According to a teammate, O'Mullane's reputation as a first-rate boxer was enough to dissuade the opposition from getting into melees with his club.\\"Old Time Football\\". The Australasian (Melbourne). 10 November 1923. p. 28. Retrieved 22 May 2016. Harrison remembered O'Mullane as a strong, but good-tempered player, and stated that \\"it was a pleasure to meet him on the football field—even when the meeting was shoulder to shoulder, and you happened to get the trifle worst of it.\\"Observer (1 August 1908). \\"The Football Jubilee: How the Game Started\\", The Argus (Melbourne). p. 7.

Mullen's subjective season-by-season ranking of players, and in The Australian Game of Football Since 1858 (2008), published by the AFL, he was placed among the five best players of the 1860s. There have been calls for O'Mullane to be inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, along with other \\"neglected heroes\\" of the game's pioneering phase. Death O'Mullane died of tuberculosis at his East Melbourne residence on 20 December 1866, aged twenty-four.

Mayerberg travelled in Muscovy for almost a year, arriving on 25 May (15 May O.S.) and departing on 5 May 1662 (26 April O.S.). He wrote two Latin accounts of the embassy. Mayerberg also supervised the production of numerous drawings, collected in the so-called Mayerberg Album. The drawings primarily by one Johann Rudolf Storn, although Mayerberg also was accompanied by a painter called Puman. The album also includes often extensive annotations of the pictures in German. The original album was kept in the Royal Library in Dresden. The Mayerberg Album was edited by Friedrich von Adelung in two volumes in 1827 (including engravings based on the drawings). The work was translated into Russian in 1873 by A. N. Shemiakin, as Puteshestvie v Moskoviiu barona Augstiona Maierberga. The first publication of actual facsimiles of the drawings (in black and white) was edited by A. S. Suvorina (1903).

Fulham United are currently in the South Australian State League 1 competition, after gaining promotion from the South Australian State League 2 competition in 2017. Their senior women’s team plays in the elite FFSA Women's National Premier League. In October of 2019 Jenna McCormick, who played in Fulham’s NPL team was selected for the Australian national women’s team to play in two friendly international matches against Chile. Fulham United boasts some 400 junior players including both boys and girls, making it by far the biggest footballing breeding ground in the Western suburbs of SA. The club has a proud 50 year history and continues to progress year on year.  Men's History - FFSA Era  2015 Fulham were granted entry into the men's FFSA NPL competitions in 2015, finally separating from the South Australian Amateur Soccer League (SAASL) and joining the FFSA State League 2 in 2016. 2016 Fulham achieved a somewhat successful debut season in the FFSA. Acknowledging their SAASL roots by keeping a very similar squad and board members to what was present prior to their FFSA induction, the club managed a 5th place finish in a season where Noarlunga United achieved promotion to the State League 1. 2017 Fulham retained many of their first team squad, whilst adding to it with the signings of Joseph Puntieri, Marco Mittaga, Daniel Aurnoutse, Mark Talladira and Thomas Dicheira. The team were in the top 2 for a large part of the season, ensuring they would receive a 'second chance' in their finals series attempt to gain promotion, however they remarkably finished 3rd overall after a final day loss to Adelaide University (3-1). At this stage their promotion hopes seemed shattered, however an incredible run of Finals Series performances (4-1 vs. Eastern United and 2-1 vs. Adelaide Cobras) lead the side to a promotion play-off against Port Pirie away. Fulham prevailed with a convincing 4-1 win with goals from Marco Mittage (2), NJ Caruso and Joseph Puntieri. Fulham went on to lose the Grand Final to Seaford Rangers 2-1 at Cooper's Stadium, however the ultimate goal of promotion was achieved. The successful year for the club was further emphasised by the successful seasons for the u18s and reserves teams, both finishing 1st in their respective leagues. Also, the club came to an agreement with the FFSA to use The Shores Football Centre, West Beach as their home ground for the upcoming 2018 State League 1 season, capping off what is arguably the most significant year in the club's history.

He has previously played for the Tokyo Excellence of the National Basketball Development League (NBDL) and the Delhi Capitals of the UBA Pro Basketball League. With the Excellence, he and Amritpal Singh became the first Indian males to sign a professional basketball contract abroad. At 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), Singh is primarily a forward and has regularly competed with India on the international stage, playing in several editions of the FIBA Asia Championship. A native of Chandigarh, he was trained at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy in Ludhiana while playing for the Punjab state team. Early in his career, Singh spent several years with amateur teams in Punjab and Tamil Nadu, winning the Senior National Basketball Championship multiple times.  Early life and career  Singh was born on 27 January 1992 in Chandigarh, India. His mother Nirmal Kaur was an athlete, while his father Mohinder Singh was sub-inspector of the Chandigarh Police and a former member of the India national basketball team. Amjyot started out by playing cricket, the most popular game in India, and he was mainly a bowler. In high school, an injury prevented him from playing cricket for three months. During the time, Singh's interest of basketball grew, and his father and coach advised him to switch. He joined his high school team in 2007. Singh said, \\"In all honesty, I didn't even know the rules of basketball or even thought of playing the sport ever.\\" By 2008, Singh was promoted to the state team and the national under-16 team. He also joined the prestigious Ludhiana Basketball Academy in Ludhiana, Punjab. The Punjab state-run academy has trained many of India's top players, such as Satnam Singh Bhamara, Amritpal Singh, and Jagdeep Singh. With Ludhiana, Amjyot was coached by S. Subramanian. Singh, in 2010, led Punjab to a junior national basketball title as its captain. In March 2011, his Ludhiana team was defeated by Punjab Police Jalandhar at the Shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh Punjab Games championship.

However, he was unable to play because he did not receive a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to compete for Tamil Nadu. Without Singh, they were defeated by his old team in the semifinal round. At the same event in 2014, Singh was forced to sit out again after suffering five fractures to his nose during the tournament. Despite his absence, his Tamil Nadu team won the title.  Professional career  In the summer of 2015, Singh took part in the BJ Challenge Summer League in Japan, where he played for Hyogo Impulse, the developmental team to the Hyogo Storks, in pursuit of a professional contract. He saw immediate success in his first week with his team at the summer league. On 25 August 2015, he signed a one- year contract with the Tokyo Excellence of the National Basketball Development League (NBDL), the second-tier league in Japan. Singh and former Hyogo teammate Amritpal Singh, who joined the Excellence at the same time, became the first Indian men's players to play in a professional basketball league outside of India. He finished the season averaging 18 points, 10 rebounds, 2 assists, and 4 blocks per game. On 17 March 2018 he was waived by the Oklahoma City Blue, but was re-signed five days later.  National team career  Singh made his first international appearance for India with the under-16 national basketball team at the Children of Asia Games in Yakutia, Russia. In the following years, he played with the under-18 team and was soon promoted to the senior national team.

At the event, Singh most notably posted a double-double of 13 points and a team-high 12 rebounds against Malaysia. Singh averaged 6.2 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game mostly coming off the bench, but India would lose all four of their games. In June 2013, Singh helped the India national basketball team earn a bid for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship in Metro Manila, Philippines, scoring 13 points in a win over Afghanistan at the qualifying round of the SABA Championship. At the FIBA Asia Championship, Singh took on a starting role for the Indian team, averaging 9.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks en route to a 2–6 record.

They were named after the Bill of Rights 1689 which placed limits on the power of the monarch.Cash, p. 249. In order to enable Wilkes to continue campaigning, the Society wanted to pay off Wilkes' debts. The preamble to the Society's charter read: \\"Whereas John Wilkes, Esq., has suffered very greatly in his private fortune, from the severe and repeated persecutions he has undergone in behalf of the public, and as it seems reasonable to us, that the man who suffers for the public good, should be supported by the public\\".Cash, p. 249. John Horne Tooke argued that the Society should send money to printers who had been jailed for printing tracts supporting liberty. Wilkes, seeing this as a diversion from paying off his debts, invited his friends to flood the next meeting of the Society to vote against this proposal.Cash, p. 289. On 9 April 1771, the Society split, with Tooke, Richard Oliver, James Townsend, John Sawbridge, Glynn and many others forming their own Constitutional Society.Cash, p. 289. This left the Bill of Rights Society under Wilkes' leadership with 63 members, with Wilkes abandoning his attempt to limit the Society's funds for himself alone.Cash, p. 291. On 23 July 1771, the Society published a manifesto calling for annual Parliaments, the exclusion of placemen and pensioners from the House of Commons, outlawing bribery in elections, the \\"full and equal representation of the people\\", the abolition of all excise taxes and for America not to be taxed without her consent.Cash, p. 295.

The Guardian called him \\"history's most successful Cupid,\\" while The Times characterized Dateline as \\"probably the largest, longest established and most successful computer dating service in the world.\\" Biography Patterson was born in Hertfordshire and educated at Bishop's Stortford College. The son of a banker, he earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of London in 1966. He founded Dateline in 1966 after a trip to Harvard University, where he had seen a computer used to match partners at a freshman's ball. The company was founded with £50.00, which he had borrowed from his parents, and later used an IBM computer. The company was highly successful, eventually becoming \\"the world's biggest and most enduring introduction service\\" in the 1980s and 1990s. However, Patterson struggled to find clients at first, and engaged in shady business practices: In 1969 he was convicted of fraud for selling lists of women who signed up for his dating service to men who were looking for prostitutes. Dateline relied heavily on advertising, taking out the first full-page ads for a dating service in newspaper and magazines during the early 1970s, and becoming well known for its catchphrase, \\"You too can find love.\\" In 1974, Patterson bought out and absorbed Com-Pat, his only major competitor and the first computer dating service in the UK, started in 1964 by Joan Ball. Patterson also published a monthly magazine titled Singles, and in 1975 he launched a travel agency, Singles Holidays. While these ventures eventually folded, Dateline continued to operate throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. During the 1990s, some estimates suggested that the company matched more than 40,000 prospective couples a year, approximately 2,000 of whom ended up getting married. Patterson was an avid aviator, purchasing his first plane in 1972, and winning the Sunday Times' Beaujolais Wine Race two years running in his single seater light aircraft. Patterson was married to Sandy Nye (also known as Valerie), and the couple had three children before divorcing in 1982. He subsequently had two more children with his former secretary, Kim Sellick. He struggled with alcoholism later in life, and died of a heart attack in 1997. After Patterson's death, Dateline was sold to the Columbus Publishing Group in 1998, for £1.45 million.

Club career Wigan Athletic Born in Wigan, Flores began his career at hometown team Wigan Athletic, a team he grew up supporting and was season ticket holder, along with his father, Manny. He first joined the club when he was 15 having initially been a Centre of Excellence player. After progressing through the U16 side, Flores was promoted to the U18 side in the summer of 2012. Flores was first included in a matchday squad for his Wigan Athletic on 12 August 2014, remaining an unused substitute as they lost 1–2 to League Two team Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium in the first round of the League Cup. He was first called up for a league match on 31 January 2015, again remaining unused for their goalless Championship draw away to Ipswich Town at Portman Road, and was also on the bench for two more games in February. He made his professional debut on 2 May on the final day of the season, with Wigan already relegated to League One, replacing Tim Chow after 64 minutes of an eventual 0–3 defeat to Brentford at Griffin Park. At the end of the 2014–15 season, Flores signed a one–year contract with the club after being offered a contract extension. On 19 September 2015, Flores made his first league start for Wigan Athletic and scored his first senior goal in a 2–1 win against Fleetwood Town at the DW Stadium. A week later, he was sent off in a 1–1 draw at Oldham Athletic for a retaliatory kick at Jay Fulton. Following this, Flores served a three match suspension. Although he served the three match suspension, he spent the most of the season on the substitute bench and played in the development squad. He also faced with injury concerns after injuring his shoulder at the end of 2015. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Flores was named the club's Young Player of the Season and won Goal of the Season following a vote by Wigan Athletic supporters. In addition, he signed a one–year contract, keeping him until 2017. Ahead of the 2016–17 season, Flores recovered from a shoulder injury and was featured for the club's pre–season tour. He then made his first appearance of the season, where he started the whole game, in a 2–1 loss against Oldham Athletic on 9 August 2016. Flores went on to make two more league appearances for the side by January. At the end of the 2016–17 season, Flores signed a two–year contract after being offered an extension to stay at the club. In the 2017–18 season, Flores scored on his only appearance for Wigan Athletic, in a 2–1 win over Blackpool in the first round of the League Cup. Loan Spells from Wigan Athletic On 30 January 2017, Flores signed for League Two club Blackpool on loan for the remainder of the season. He made his debut five days later in a 1–1 draw with Colchester United at Bloomfield Road, playing the full 90 minutes. He scored his first goal for the Tangerines in a 4–1 victory at Carlisle United on 11 February 2017. After the match, Flores was voted Man of the Match by the club's supporters. Since joining the club, Flores quickly established himself in the first team and quickly made an impression for the side. Flores scored his second goal for Blackpool, in a 3–0 win over Plymouth Argyle on 7 March 2017. A month later, on 17 April 2017, he scored his third goal for Blackpool, in a 1–0 win over Doncaster Rovers. He later helped Blackpool earn promotion back to League One at the first attempt. At the end of the 2016–17 season, having made 21 appearances and scoring 3 times, he returned to his parent club, Wigan Athletic. On 18 August 2017, Flores was loaned to League Two club Chesterfield a season-long loan deal. He made his Chesterfield debut the next day, where he started the whole game, in a 2–0 win over Port Vale on 19 August 2017. It wasn't until on 17 October 2017 when he scored his first Chesterfield goal, in a 2–0 win over Crawley Town. However, his loan was cut short after being involved in a car accident and never played for the side again. By the time of his departure, he went on to make 15 appearances for the side. After his loan spell at Chesterfield was terminated, Flores joined Conference side AFC Fylde on loan until 4 April 2018. His only appearance came on 24 March 2018, where he started as left–back and played for 62 minutes before being substituted, in a 2–0 loss against Dagenham & Redbridge. On 9 August 2018, Flores joined Allsvenskan side Östersunds on loan until the end of 2018. Dundalk On 25 January 2019, Irish champions Dundalk announced the signing of Flores on a two-year deal. Personal life Flores was involved in a two-car head-on accident while on his way to the Proact Stadium on 23 October 2017 for training with Chesterfield. He was initially taken to the Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust by ambulance before being transferred to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield. By November, he was discharged from the hospital and began rehabilitating his injuries sustained from the crash. Four months after the crash, Flores was charged with driving offence after it was found that he was driving without due care and attention, which led to a road smash. Ultimately, he was fined £902 after pleading guilty to driving without due care and attention. Flores attended Our Lady's, Aspull and revealed that his mother worked for the school. Flores said he's an active user on social media. He also stated that he has a Spanish heritage.

The Blaues Kartell is the largest one of similar circles within the Weinheimer Senioren- Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical fraternities found in Europe, its roots dating back to the 15th century A.D.Die Corps. \\"Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?\\" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.Klimczuk, Stephen & Warner, Gerald. \\"Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies\\".

History  The Blaues Kartell was founded on April 24, 1874 by Landsmannschaft (today Corps) Hannoverania Hannover and Landsmannschaft Feronia Berlin (later Corps Teutonia, today part of Corps Berlin). Both fraternities belonged to the local Berliner SC of veterinary-medical Landsmannschaften.

The reason is that newly formed fraternities are understood to be inhomogeneous, thus first need to internally debate and decide to re-join the Blaues Kartell, then successfully petition to be accepted as an equal member of the Kartell again, a process which requires the current Kartell members to agree on the new potential member. As a result of formerly being a member but not yet having re-joined the Kartell, a friendly relationship exists with Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen that has its origin in Marko-Guestphalia's history: the former Corps Albingia Dresden existed until its suspension due to Nazi pressure against the German Student Corps in the 1930s and remained dormant for years before being reconstructed in Aachen after the war. The fusion of the reconstructed, now Corps Albingia Aachen with the Corps Marko-Guestphalia in 1996 caused Albingia having to exit the Kartell. Marko-Guestphalia and Saxo-Thuringia thereafter established an official relationship to commemorate the former band between the two fraternities.

Its main settlements are the village of Corston and the hamlets of Milbourne and Rodbourne (not to be confused with the Rodbourne suburb of Swindon). Geography The parish is rural with small settlements. It surrounds Malmesbury to the north, east and south (but not to the west where the parish is Brokenborough). In the southeastern outskirts of Malmesbury the parish includes houses along the B4042 Swindon road, together with the development known as Cowbridge Mill, on the site of Cowbridge House. To the south, the parish extends some from Malmesbury, almost to Stanton St Quintin, including parts of Hullavington Airfield and the adjacent Buckley Barracks. The Bristol Avon forms part of the north and east boundaries of the parish. Its tributary the Gauze Brook crosses the parish. History Between the 7th and 11th centuries, the land which forms the modern parish was acquired by Malmesbury Abbey. By 1191 the parish church of the town was St Paul's, close to the abbey. After the creation of Malmesbury municipal borough in 1886, the remainder of the parish was renamed St Paul Malmesbury Without. Land from Westport, southwest of the town, was added in 1896. Governance The parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.  Notable buildings  Cole Park, a Grade II* listed country house about south of Malmesbury, stands in parkland where Malmesbury Abbey had a deer-park. Parts of the house are from the 16th century but it was much altered and extended in the 17th and 18th. The churches at Corston (15th century, rebuilt 1881 and 1911) and Rodbourne (12th and 13th centuries) are also Grade II* listed.

Her work was characterized by intense color and dream themes. Biography Mabel Arcondo was born in Asunción, Paraguay, in 1940. At the age of 17, she contracted polio and spent the remainder of her life in a wheelchair. Mabel studied commercial art in Buenos Aires and learned the rudiments of painting from Adán Kunos in Asunción, but she was largely self- taught. Stylistically her work is complex, drawing on a dream-like quality which transforms reality in the manner of Chagall and using color schemes of fauvism, but with an original sense of melancholy, according to Ticio Escobar. Her paintings have strong use of color, good composition and a surrealistic quality. In the 1960s and 1970s in Paraguay, there was a flowering of local painters including Arcondo, Carlos Colombino, Ricardo Migliorisi, Ignacio Núñez Soler, and Laura Márquez, who were able to capture in their works the culture of Paraguay. She began to exhibit her paintings in 1964 and has works in both private collections and the Museo Paraguayo de Arte Contemporáneo (The Paraguayan Museum of Contemporary Art). Arcondo's work was seen as revolutionary, on the cusp between primitivism and surrealism. In the mid-1970s, Arconda began a relationship with the artist Ruben Milessi. Though doctors warned her that a pregnancy might jeopardize her health further, she gave birth to her only child, Daniel Milessi, on 3 June 1976. Soon after the birth, she died in Asunción. She is considered one of the iconic painters of Paraguay. Her works are held and shown in numerous museum collections and in 2014 were part of a discussion and exhibit presented by the International Association of Art Critics Paraguay Chapter.

Early life and family She was born \\"in stark rural poverty\\" in 1945 in Richland, Georgia, the second of three sisters. She can't remember her father, and her mother and stepfather separated when she was aged about 9. Her older sister Carrie Francis died of a brain abscess when Mary was 12, after which she dropped out of school to look after her younger sister. She briefly married at age 14, and had her first son. A year later she began work as a domestic. She became pregnant with her second son in New York in 1964, before returning to Georgia in 1967, where she eventually became a cashier in a restaurant. When she lived and worked in the White House, her sons stayed in an apartment in the working-class Washington suburb of Suitland, Maryland and were looked after by her sister during the day, while she took a taxi to take care of them in the evening before returning by taxi to the White House late at night to be up early for Amy. She officially separated from her husband in 1979, and changed her name back from Mary Fitzpatrick to Mary Prince. She is a devout Christian. Conviction for murder She was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of murdering another woman's boyfriend in April 1970 in Lumpkin, Georgia. She and her cousin Aniemaude had gone into a bar in Lumpkin, and Aniemaude had got into an argument. In 1977 Mary said: “I went outside and heard a shot. Aniemaude and this woman were fighting over Aniemaude’s gun. I didn’t know anything about guns, but I tried to take it away and it went off. We didn’t know it had hit anyone.” Clare Crawford added: \\"The other woman, however, claimed that Mary seized the gun and deliberately fired it, killing the woman’s boyfriend.\\" Prince was defended by a white court-appointed lawyer whom she first met on the day of the trial. In 1977, she said \\"I was under the impression I was pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter, but it turned out to be murder.\\" Jimmy Carter (in 2005) and Kate Andersen Brower (in 2015) both wrote that her lawyer advised her to plead guilty and promised a light sentence. Clare Crawford wrote in 1977 that \\"Her attorney says that he read the indictment to Mary before she made her plea\\". Prince said in 1977 that she saw her lawyer twice for 10 or 15 minutes and that she spent a total of less than an hour in court before receiving her life sentence. Jimmy Carter says Prince was lucky the dead man was not white, as she would then have \\"likely\\" suffered the fate of Lena Baker, a black woman pardoned in 2005, 60 years after being executed by electric chair. Rosalynn Carter says that she was convicted because of the color of her skin. Nanny to Amy Carter Prince became Amy's nanny in 1971 while Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia and she was a trusty prisoner assigned to the governor's mansion, after being interviewed in December 1970 and chosen that month by Rosalynn Carter to look after Amy because Rosalynn was convinced of her innocence. In 1975, when Jimmy Carter's term as governor ended, Prince was sent back to prison. However, in January 1977 she was able to travel to Washington for Carter's inauguration as U.S. president. Partly thanks to a letter to the parole board by First Lady Rosalynn Carter, and partly thanks to Jimmy Carter, who asked to be designated as her parole officer, Prince was reprieved, and was able to live and work at the White House for the four years of Carter's presidency. Pardon She was eventually granted a full pardon after \\"a reexamination of the evidence and trial proceedings by the original judge revealed that she was completely innocent\\". Later life As of 2015, she lives near the Carters in Plains, Georgia, and sees them frequently, and she still sometimes babysits for their grandchildren. Media portrayal When she was in the White House, her story was widely reported in the media, and some of the coverage was \\"not ... kind\\". The coverage included a skit on Saturday Night Live with Amy played by Sissy Spacek, and Prince played by comedian Garrett Morris in drag. Legacy Jimmy Carter dedicated his 2004 book, Sharing Good Times, to Prince, and discusses her in his 2005 book, Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis, as an example of the dangers of racism and of the death penalty, saying that had the dead man been white, she would \\"likely\\" have been wrongfully executed like Lena Baker. Prince is also featured in the 2015 Kate Andersen Brower book The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House. Political activist and former Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army member Assata Shakur in her Assata An Autobiography (book) creates a critical portrait of Carter's relationship towards Mary Prince, comparing Carter's treatment of Mary as akin to that of a domestic slave and that this is a notable example of how the criminal justice system perpetuates Black and Third World people's enslavement.

Baari had its world premiere at International Film Festival of South Asia in Toronto, Canada in April 2015. It has also been shown at Imagineindia International Film Festival in Madrid, Spain. Real life farmers and locals from village Changaliwal of Lehragaga in Sangrur district have played different roles in the film highlighting the plight of the widows left behind by the debt-ridden farmers who commit suicide.  Plot  The story of the film is set in rural Punjab, a province in India known to have been the bread basket of the country, but now facing fallout of severe agrarian crisis. While men are addicted to drugs, women have been forced to look out for sustenance elsewhere. Some women in the village have started going to the nearby towns about whom the villagers make insinuating remarks. It's night and a woman, the central character in the film, who remains unnamed, is unable to sleep. She recounts her recent past from the time she came to that house as a newly-wedded bride. Her first husband, a small-time farmer, committed suicide and she was remarried to her brother in law, Bhola, a cripple and a drug-addict. Failing to cope with mounting debts he too ended his life consuming pesticide. Having watched them die one after the other, she is the one left to look for the rest of the family, consisting of her young daughter and infirm father in law. Spending the whole night awake she finally arrives at a decision. The woman who has so far seen decisions being taken for her by others only, decides to take things in her own hands and fight on. As another day comes up she announces to her father in law that she is going to town. She steps out of her home all prepared to face the challenges of life anew.

As the last athlete to compete in the 2000 Sydney Olympics Rodriquez may have received its largest ovation as over 100,000 spectators cheered him on as they awaited the closing ceremonies and fireworks only moments after he crossed the finish line. Post-Olympic Career Rodriguez coached and mentored the Federated States of Micronesia's Olympic track and field athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Part of the Volunteer Force, later the Territorial Force (renamed the Territorial Army in 1920), the battalion was part of the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) and recruited from the north-western suburbs of London. It served as infantry in the Mesopotamian campaign during World War I and as an air defence regiment during and after World War II. Origins The battalion's origins lay in the enthusiasm for joining local Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) engendered by an invasion scare in 1859.Beckett. Two of the many units formed in the populous county of Middlesex were the 'Marylebone & West Middlesex Rifles' and the 'Harrow Rifles'.Westlake, pp. 166 & 168.Beckett, Appendix VII. Marylebone & West Middlesex Rifles The 9th (Marylebone & West Middlesex) Middlesex RVC was formed at Lord's Cricket Ground on 14 October 1859 under the command of Lord Radstock. Initially consisting of six companies, it rose to eight by April 1860.Frederick, pp. 212–3.Beckett, p. 48.Burke's: Baron Radstock.9th Middlesex at Regiments.org. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell Reforms, the 9th Middlesex RVC (with the 18th attached, see below) formed part of Brigade No 49 (Middlesex and Metropolitan) alongside the Regular battalions of the Royal Fusiliers (the City of London Regiment).Spiers, p. 195.Army List. The unit was renumbered the 5th (West Middlesex) Middlesex RVC on 3 September 1880 and was attached as a Volunteer Battalion (VB) to the Royal Fusiliers on 1 July the following year, transferring to the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) as the 4th VB in July 1883, without changing its title in either case. Its original uniform was grey with red facings, but in 1891 it adopted the KRRC's Rifle green with red facings. Its HQ was at 29 Park Road, Regent's Park.Barnes, Appendix III. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a Mobilisation Scheme for units of the Volunteer Force, which would assemble by brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime the brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. The 5th Middlesex RVC (with the renumbered 9th still attached, see below) formed part of the South London Volunteer Infantry Brigade. By the time the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the Territorial Force in 1908, the battalion had moved to the 1st London Brigade. Volunteers from the unit served in the Second Boer War, earning it the Battle honour South Africa 1900–02. Harrow Rifles The 18th (Harrow Rifles) Middlesex RVC was formed at Harrow as a single company on 30 December 1859. Many of the original recruits came from the staff and senior pupils of Harrow School, which formed a cadet corps of the unit in 1870. The first commanding officer was Captain John Charles Templer, who was the agent for Rajah Brooke of Sarawak, and in 1861 became editor of the Volunteer Service Gazette, the official journal of the Volunteer Movement. The unit also ran its own athletic club.Beckett, p. 33. It was always associated with the West Middlesex; together, they formed a battalion- sized unit within the Volunteer Infantry Brigades. In the renumbering of 1880, the Harrow unit became the 9th Middlesex RVC and like the 5th was attached to the Royal Fusiliers in 1881, transferring to the KRRC in 1883. Its uniform was Rifle green with green facings. On 1 August 1899 (now 4 companies strong) it amalgamated with the West Middlesex, the Harrow School Cadet Corps becoming the 27th Corps until 1906 when it too joined the West Middlesex as a cadet company. Territorial Force On the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the 5th (West Middlesex) RVC became the 9th Battalion Middlesex Regiment. It formed part of the Middlesex Brigade of the Home Counties Division. Its headquarters moved to Pound Lane, Willesden Green.James, p. 93.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49–54.Middlesex Rgt at Long, Long Trail.Pound Lane Drill Hall at Stepping Forward London. World War I Mobilisation During the period of tension before the outbreak of war, the 9th Battalion sent two special service sections to guard a cable station at Cuckmere Haven and Birling Gap (28 July). When the mobilisation orders were received on 4 August 1914, the Home Counties Division was on the march from Aldershot to Salisbury Plain for its annual training. The Middlesex Brigade had reached Larkhill, when the battalions were sent back to their headquarters to mobilise. The 9th Battalion entrained at Amesbury on 5 August and reached Willesden that morning. By the end of the day the battalion was entrained again for its war station at Sheerness. Here it dug trenches for a few days until relieved by Special Reserve troops and moved to Sittingbourne.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 67–8. On 11 August, in common with the majority of the men of the Home Counties Division, the 9th Battalion accepted liability for overseas service. The Home Service-only and under-age men, together with the recruits who were flooding in, remained at the depots to form 2nd-Line battalions. The titles of these 2nd Line units were the same as the original 1st Line, but the two would be distinguished by '1/' and '2/' prefixes. The 2/9th Bn formed on 18 September; subsequently, a 3/9th Battalion was formed to provide drafts to the other battalions.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 69–72. 1/9th Battalion =India= In October 1914, the Home Counties Division was ordered to India to relieve Regular troops there. The 1/9th Middlesex embarked at Southampton on 29 October in the transports Dilwara and Dongola, and disembarked at Bombay on 2 December. On arrival, the Home Counties Division was split up and the battalions were distributed to stations all over India. For the next three years they acted as a peacetime garrison, while suffering a steady drain of their best men to officer training and other duties.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 331–2. 1/9th Middlesex was assigned to the Presidency Brigade in 8th (Lucknow) Division, based around Calcutta. The main body was stationed at Dinapur, with E, F and H Companies detached to guard the arsenal at Dum Dum; later D and F Companies went to garrison Barrackpore, where they were responsible for guarding the Rifle Factory Ishapore and the Cossipore gun and shell factory. When the four-company system was adopted in May 1915, the companies at Dinapur provided A and B Companies together with the battalion scouts and machine- gunners, those at Barrackpore became C Company, and those Dum Dum became D Company and the signallers.Perry, pp. 99–104.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 332–4. In May and August 1915, the battalion supplied its first drafts to the 2nd Bn Norfolk Regiment serving in Indian Expeditionary Force D in Mesopotamia; of the 50 other ranks sent, 20 died at the Siege of Kut or in captivity afterwards. In January 1916, the battalion was transferred to the 5th (Jhelum) Brigade, 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division, on the North West Frontier. On arrival at Rawalpindi, it was ordered to mobilise for service with Force D. However, the order was quickly cancelled, and for the next two years the battalion continued to train. During this period, it was constantly moving station:Perry, pp. 39–45, pp. 55–8, 137–40.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 335–40. * March–April 1916 to Nowshera Brigade, 1st (Peshawar) Division, for mountain warfare training; * April–June to Murree; * June–November to Galis Brigade, with one company detached to guard Attock Fort; * November returned to Jhelum Brigade * February 1917 to 43rd Indian Brigade in 16th Indian Division, a reserve division for the North West Frontier * March 1917 to Ambala Brigade in 3rd Lahore Divisional Area (the 3rd (Lahore) Division being absent, serving in Mesopotamia). Here, the battalion received a large draft from the 7th Reserve Battalion (see below) and from the Essex Regiment, which partly restored its strength after years of losing men to sickness and supplying so many drafts and specialists.Wyrall, Vol II, p. 341. From November 1917, the battalion reverted to the title of 9th Middlesex when the 2/9th Bn disbanded in England (see below). =Mesopotamia= In October 1917, the 9th Bn was selected to be the British battalion in a new 53rd Indian Brigade being sent to the Mesopotamian Front. On 5 November it was brought up to full strength with drafts of 100 menfrom the 1/10th Middlesex and 200 from the 1/25th London Regiment. The men from 1/25th Londons, formerly a bicycle battalion, were disappointed at being spread across all 16 platoons of the 1/9th rather than being kept together as a distinct company. The battalion embarked on the transport Egra at Karachi on 19 November. It landed at Basra on 23 November and the brigade became part of 18th Indian Division at Baghdad on 24 December.Perry, pp. 147–50.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 341–2.Anon, London Cyclists, p. 258. The division was not concentrated until mid-March 1918, and when it moved north up the Tigris, 53rd Brigade was left behind to subdue Nejef, south of Baghdad. After making a forced march of nearly 90 miles in a week through almost waterless country and carried out a demonstration, the brigade was being withdrawn when trouble flared up again. The town was then blockaded from 21 March to 19 May, with the 9th Middlesex being involved in minor actions. The battalion celebrated Albuera Day in the Mesopotamian desert. 53rd Brigade then rejoined the division at Akab, near Samarra. Summer weather made campaigning impractical in Mesopotamia, so the division was engaged in roadbuilding until the beginning of October, when orders were received to join the renewed advance up the Tigris.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 344–51.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 2–4, 12–7.Anon, London Cyclists, pp. 260–4. 9th Middlesex moved up to Tikrit on 10 October, arriving on 14 October, with many men suffering from sickness. The division began its attack (the Battle of Sharqat) on 24 October, with 53rd Brigade in support. The brigade passed through the Fathah Gorge and the following day pushed on under artillery and machine-gun fire to establish a bridgehead over the Little Zab. Between 11.00 on 25 October and 17.00 on 26 October, the infantry covered .Anon, London Cyclists, pp. 264–5.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 352–56.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 18–27. On 26 October, the brigade patrolled forward up the left bank of the Tigris and the right bank of the Little Zab, and demonstrated towards Humr Bridge, to make the Turks think that a crossing was planned. That the night the Turks began to retreat and on 27 October, 53rd Brigade began a pursuit march, delayed only by Turkish artillery fire.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 357–58.Wilson- Johnston, pp. 29–30. The Turkish force surrendered on the evening of 29 October, when 9th Middlesex was about to support an attack on the opposite bank of the Tigris. 18th Indian Division pushed a flying column on to capture Mosul, while the infantry retired towards its railhead at Baiji for supplies. After the Armistice of Mudros came into effect on 31 October, the division began preparing for the postwar occupation of Iraq as the Turks withdrew.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 358–61; 377–8.Wilson-Johnston, pp. 34–40. Demobilisation began in early 1919, but on 23 May the battalion (now reduced to three companies) was ordered to join a punitive column marching into Kurdistan. The column was in contact with insurgents from 28 May to 18 June when the rebel leader was wounded and captured. While 'mopping up' after the formal surrender, two companies of the 9th Middlesex and two squadrons of Indian cavalry found themselves surrounded near Kirkuk. They were pinned down for three days under heavy rifle fire, with rations being dropped to them by the Royal Air Force, before being relieved.Anon, London Cyclists, pp. 265–7. The battalion was demobilised on 11 September 1919. 2/9th Battalion The 2/9th Bn formed at Willesden Green in September 1914 and was assigned to the 2/1st Middlesex Brigade (later 201st Brigade) in what became the 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division. The battalion was billeted in Staines for training, but the shortage of equipment was so great that the men had to train with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75–82. Late in 1915, 201st Brigade moved to Sevenoaks, later camping at Barham. The 67th Division had dual responsibility as part of the mobile force for Home Defence, and to train drafts for overseas service. Twice it was ordered to prepare for service in Ireland, and in April 1917 it prepared to go to France. However, nothing came of these deployments, and the division was drained of its manpower as its men were drafted to frontline units. The 2/9th Middlesex was disbanded on 14 November 1917 at Patrixbourne in Kent. 3/9th Battalion The 3/9th Bn was formed at Willesden in March 1915, and moved to Cambridge. It was retitled 9th Reserve Bn, Middlesex Regiment, in April 1915. Its role was to train recruits for service with 1st and 2nd Line units. On 1 September 1916, it was absorbed into the 7th Reserve Bn, Middlesex Regiment, at Purfleet.Wyrall, Vol I, p. 71. Interwar The 9th Battalion Middlesex Regiment reformed when the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920. The following year the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA). The battalion formed part of 132nd (Middlesex and Sussex) Brigade in 44th (Home Counties) Division.Titles and Designations. In the 1930s, the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence, particularly for London, was addressed by converting a number of infantry battalions to the AA role. The 9th Middlesex became a searchlight unit in 1938, taking the subsidiary title of 60th Searchlight Regiment, consisting of HQ and 429–431 Searchlight Batteries at Willesden.Frederick, pp. 860, 870.Litchfield, p. 179. World War II 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth 60th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939, the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. 9th Battalion Middlesex Regiment (60th Searchlight Regiment) formed part of 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division, covering the area north of London.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge Table LX, p. 378. In August 1940, all the TA's AA units became part of the Royal Artillery (RA), the 9th Middlesex becoming 60th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, RA. However, the regiment continued to wear its Middlesex cap badge and buttons, with RA collar badges.Farndale, Annex M, pp. 338, 340. By that time – the height of the Battle of Britain – the regiment had been transferred within 2 AA Division to 41st (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which had special responsibility for defending Royal Air Force airfields in East Anglia.2 AA Div at RA 39–45. Farndale, Annex D, p. 259.Routledge Table LXV, p. 396. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 231st S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp where it provided the basis for a new 523 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 85th S/L Rgt. On 23 January 1942 371 S/L Bty joined 60th S/L Rgt from 43rd (5th Duke of Wellington's Regiment) S/L Rgt. 126th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment =Home Defence= On 10 January 1942, the regiment was ordered to convert again, becoming 126th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA on 23 February.Frederick, pp. 806, 839. It comprised 415, 429, 430 and 431 LAA Batteries, and after training at No 8 LAA Practice Camp at Watchet, it returned to 41 AA Bde in May, deploying its 40mm Bofors guns to defend Norwich and the nearby airfield of RAF Horsham St Faith. In September, the regiment was reduced to a three-battery establishment, 431 Bty transferring to a newly raised 144 LAA Regiment.126 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/7712. Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944 The regiment continued to serve in Home Forces until 1944, by which time it was at Leicester forming part of 74 AA Bde. In January 1944, it moved to Bournemouth to take over Air Defence of Great Britain commitments around Boscombe, Poole and Swanage. It handed over these commitments in late February and moved to No 11 LAA Training Camp at Stiffkey, followed by deployment exercises in Lincolnshire. In March, the regiment joined Second Army in preparation for Operation Overlord, and in April was deployed to Eastleigh to defend the Overlord concentration areas, engaging night intruder raids.126 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1140. After the bulk of the invasion force had embarked, 126 Rgt's batteries were trained at Larkhill Camp in engaging unseen ground targets. Ordered to its embarkation marshalling area in August, the regiment was diverted to Pevensey, Hove and Bexhill-on-Sea to engage incoming V-1 flying bombs as part of Operation Diver. =North West Europe= The regiment finally landed in Normandy on 11–12 October 1944 and served through the campaign in North West Europe as part of 74 AA Bde providing AA cover to 21st Army Group. Initially, it was deployed to Gheel, where it covered the artillery of I Corps (49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 4th Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) and 59th AGRA) in Operation Rebound. Later, it formed part of 'Bob-Force', holding the line of the Turnhout Canal alongside 104th US Infantry Division (the 'Timberwolves'). During this period, it was frequently used to engage enemy sniper and mortar positions with ground fire, as well as firing at V-1s heading for Antwerp.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 522 & 538.Ellis, Germany, p. 370.Joslen, p. 463.Routledge, p. 325. When the south bank of the Scheldt at Antwerp was cleared, 74 AA Bde, with 126 LAA as its LAA component, was switched round the city to support the advance of II Canadian and I British Corps towards 's-Hertogenbosch. It then took over protection of bridges along the road from the Maas to the Waal captured during Operation Market Garden.Routledge, pp. 344–5. From 15 November 1944, the regiment defended the Nijmegen bridges against air and waterborne attack under command of 74 AA Bde and then of 1st Canadian Infantry Division. On 17 December, after weeks of quiescence, the Luftwaffe made a major effort to support its surprise attack in the Ardennes (the Battle of the Bulge). In 21st Army Group's sector, the Maas and Waal bridges were attacked by waves of Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighter- bombers operating at low level (below radar and HAA), which had to be engaged by LAA guns. Further low-level sweeps followed on 24 December.Routledge, pp. 345–6. The regiment's positions were frequently shelled during the winter. Until the end of March 1945 there were almost daily engagements of single enemy aircraft in the area. During the operations in the Klever Reichswald (Operation Veritable), 126 LAA continued to defend the critical Waal and Maas crossings in support of II Canadian Corps. Improved radar techniques were allowing effective LAA barrages to be fired, driving the attackers back to higher levels into the range of HAA guns.Routledge, pp. 350–1. In April, the regiment formed the basis of 'Kenforce' under its CO, Lt-Col W.D. Kenyon, which included a troop of 2 S/L Rgt, a troop of 93 LAA, two companies of Belgian Fusiliers and Royal Navy detachments operating ASDIC to detect underwater attacks on the bridges.126 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4965. The regiment remained in these positions until cease fire on 3 May 1945. After VE Day, the regiment was engaged in occupation duties under the Canadians until it was placed in suspended animation between 1 February and 9 April 1946.Routledge, pp 361–3, Table LVII, p. 366. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment was reformed as 595th (9th Battalion Middlesex Regiment) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA,Frederick, p. 1025. with its HQ now at Kingsbury, and 873rd Movement Light Battery (The Middlesex Regiment), RA at Staines. 595th LAA/SL Regiment The 595th was redesignated as a Light Anti- Aircraft/Searchlight regiment in 1949. It formed part of 82 AA Bde at Heston.Frederick, p. 1025.592–638 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.67–106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947 On 10 March 1955, AA Command was disbanded, and many of its TA regiments were disbanded or reduced. 82 AA Brigade was disbanded and 595 LAA Rgt was amalgamated with two other LAA/SL regiments of the brigade in NW London – 571st (Middlesex) and 604th (Royal Fusiliers) – to form a new regiment: 571st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, (9th Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment, Duke of Cambridge's Own), in which the old 595th formed 'Q' Battery. The new unit was in 33rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade.Frederick, p. 1023.3rd City of London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) at Regiments.org564–591 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.30–66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. Finally, on 1 May 1961, the 571st (9th Middlesex) amalgamated with the 7th and 8th Middlesex to form a combined infantry battalion (5th Middlesex), and all links with air defence and the Royal Artillery were severed.Barnes, Appendix V. 873 M/L Battery Former TA Drill Hall, Leacroft, Staines Movement light or 'artificial moonlight' units used searchlights to illuminate ground operations at night. 873 Battery formed at the Drill Hall, Leacroft, Staines, with an establishment of Battery HQ (BHQ) and three troops of eight lights each, with a Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers workshop. In 1958, the battery moved to hutted accommodation at Twickenham. Because the sole remaining role of searchlights was ground illumination, the battery was converted from RA to Royal Engineers in 1961 as 873 (Middlesex) Movement Light Squadron under the command of 27 Engineer Brigade.Frederick, p. 1032.Litchfield, p. 180.Searchlight history at 873 Movement Light Squadron site.Anti-Aircraft Command - Middlesex at Stepping Forward.Royal Engineers at Stepping Forward. 873 M/L Sqn provided lighting during the construction of the Medway bridges for the M2 motorway in 1962, but its offer to light the rescue efforts after the Aberfan disaster in 1966 was rejected. When the TA was converted into the smaller TAVR in 1967, 873 Sqn was reduced to HQ and one Troop – the only dedicated searchlight unit remaining not only in the British Army but the whole of NATO. The squadron moved to the TA Centre at Horns Lane, Acton, and in 1975 became part of 73 Engineer Regiment. In 1988, it was transferred to 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit, and its title was changed to 220 (Searchlight) Field Squadron (EOD), with searchlight operation in addition to normal Sapper duties. The unit moved to the TA Centre at Vicarage Lane, Heston, in 1988, and was disbanded in 1999. Insignia On transfer to the RA, the regiment was allowed the privilege of wearing the Middlesex Regiment cap badge and buttons together with RA collar badges. A regimental arm flash was worn during World War II, consisting of a diamond divided vertically in maroon and gold. Postwar, the Middlesex Regiment cap badge was worn on the beret and forage cap with a maroon and gold diamond backing; however, the arm flash was altered from a diamond to a triangle. Officers wore the cap badge in silver with the other ranks' cap badge as their collar badge. In service dress (which was the darker 'Guards' shade of khaki) the officers wore the badges in bronze. They are believed to have worn a maroon and gold lanyard. The unit's first stand of Regimental colours, presented by HRH Princess Beatrice of Battenburg in 1910 and laid up in 1950, and their replacements presented that year by Lt-Gen Sir Brian Horrocks, are preserved in the Middlesex Regiment Chapel in St Paul's Cathedral.Middlesex colours at Stepping Forward.

Background Romance elements in the early Byzantine period Following Roman withdrawal from the province of Dacia at the end of the 3rd century, the name of the Roman region was changed to Dacia Aureliana, (later Dacia Ripensis); it extended over most of what is now Serbia and Bulgaria, and an undetermined number of Romanized Dacians were settled there. A strong Roman presence persisted in the region through the end of Justinian's I reign in the 6th century. Amalgamation of Slavs and Romans The Slavs, settling the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries, absorbed the Romanized populations over the centuries. Some Romance placenames survived Slavicization, such as the names of rivers and mountains. The Old Roman culture was preserved mainly in maritime Dalmatia, while Eastern, Greek influence and linguistics prevailed in the hinterland. The linguistical border roughly went from Lezhë, below the Shkodër-Prizren road towards Lipljan and Skopje, and then towards Sofia. The Roman element in the inlands retreated into the mountains with the Slavic incursions, however, larger areas of Roman elements were preserved in some parts of inland Balkans, such as in southern Macedonia and in Carpathian regions. Romance shepherd terminology were preserved in certain areas of the Dinaric Alps. The Slavs, due to their large numbers and abundance of reserves, easily assimilated the Roman population due to the deteriorating state of the Roman Empire. The Serbs came under the Latin sphere of influence, and first came into contact with Christianity through these contacts. Serbs adopted many Latin terms, part of the vocabulary still today. With time, ties between the Slavs and Romans of the Balkans became more tighter, the larger numbered Slavs absorbing the largest part of the Roman population in the Western Balkans. The Vlach shepherds completely mixed with the Serbs, a result of the predominant pastoralist society and Christianity. Romans for long held themselves separately in the city municipalities on the coast, however, after the 10th century the Slavic inflow strengthened and subsequently the maritime cities had more or less Slavic character (such as Dubrovnik and Split, becoming holders of Slavic culture and literature in the 14th and 15th centuries). As anthropologist J. Erdeljanović noted, Serbs received cultural elements from the Vlachs, such as the stone house and cottage, parts of folk costumes, some shepherd terminology and likely some shepherding skills. Combinations of Slavic–Romance nomenclature were preserved in higher mountainous areas, and with the many migrations from the mountains into the lowlands northwards, most of the preserved old Balkan characteristics were merged into the general characteristics of all or larger parts of Serbs and Croats from the Adriatic and to the Timok river. History Vlachs are first mentioned in 1198 living in the area between Timok and Morava which was later annexed by the Serbians in 1292, by Stefan Milutin. Also Stefan Milutin in a deed of gift given to the monastery of Hilander disposed that Vlachs which coming to the kingdom must belong to the holy Church, this also applied to foreigners as well as to dependent peasant.Andre Du Nay; (1996) The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language p. 35; Matthias Corvinus Publishing, Serbia of 12th and 13th century with Greek-Orthodox population received a growing number of Vlach population which migrated from Dalmatian coast, Epirus, or Thessalonica and from Bulgaria after Kaliman Asen II was deposed and expelled. Vlachs in the time of Stefan Dečanski and Stefan Dušan provided Serbian state with excellent horses for the army. The Serbian peasants and the Vlach herdsmen had disagreements with each other especially because Vlach destruction of the cornfields, forcing Serbian State to regulate the wandering shepherds and to protect his own Slav peasants with draconic laws. After that many Vlachs migrated from Serbia to Wallachia or Transylvania Endre Haraszti; (1977) Origin of the Rumanians (Vlach Origin, Migration and Infiltration to Transylvania) p. 60-61; Danubian Press, Northwest of Niš there are records of Vlachs in 1382 and in Kučevo area from 1428. Suleiman the Magnificent in 1521 made a law (Canun name) for Vlachs living between Braničevo and Vidin.Andre Du Nay; (1996) The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language p. 35, 43; Matthias Corvinus Publishing, Social class The vlasi (власи) or pastiri (пастири) were dependent shepherds in the medieval Serbian state, part of the sebri social class. The multitude and likely prevalence of Vlachs (Romanized remnants) among the shepherds made the term \\"Vlachs\\" a synonym for shepherds, similarly as the term Srbljin was sporadically used for farmers. The status of the vlasi was basically equal to the meropsi. Vlachs in Nemanjić charters The first mention of \\"Vlachs\\" in Serbian historical sources is the Hilandar founding charter (1198–99) by Stefan Nemanja. 170 Vlach families were mentioned from Prizren area,Andre Du Nay; (1996) The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language p. 33; Matthias Corvinus Publishing, granted together with villages and churches. Romance names were identified through de Radu i Đurđa. Nemanja's son, Stefan the First-Crowned, granted the Žiča monastery with 200 Vlach families from Prokletije mountain, near Peć, Kosovo. In 1220, king Stefan proclaimed that all Vlachs of his kingdom belonged to the Eparchy of Žiča. Vlach counts (comes catuni or catunarius) were mentioned in Hvosno in 1220, 1282–98 and 1302–09. Crusader chronicles describe encounters with Vlachs in various parts of modern Serbia in the 12th and 13th centuries. King Stefan Uroš I of Serbia granted the Hilandar monastery with another 30 Vlach families from the Drim river. In the grant (around 1280) by his wife and queen, Helen of Anjou, which confirmed the grant given by Stefan Vladislav to the Vranjina monastery, the Vlachs are separately mentioned, along with Arbanasi (Albanians), Latins and Serbs. King Stefan Milutin's charter to the Banjska monastery granted it with six katuns (highland hamlets), and also made the first mention of the \\"Vlach law\\" (zakon Vlahom). In 1330, King Stefan Dečanski granted the Visoki Dečani monastery with pasture land along with Vlach and Albanian katuns around Drim and Lim rivers of whom had to carry salt and provide serf labour for the monastery. \\"From the details of the monastic estates given in the chrysobulls, further information can be gleaned about these Vlachs and Albanians. The earliest reference is in one of Nemanja’s charters giving property to Hilandar, the Serbian monastery on Mount Athos: 170 Vlachs are mentioned, probably located in villages round Prizren. When Dečanski founded his monastery of Dečani in 1330, he referred to ‘villages and katuns of Vlachs and Albanians’ in the area of the white Drin: a katun (alb.:katund) was a shepherding settlement.\\" \\"The monastery at Dečani stands on a terrace commanding passes into High Albania. When Stefan Uros III founded it in 1330, he gave it many villages in the plain and catuns of Vlachs and Albanians between the Lim and the Beli Drim. Vlachs and Albanians had to carry salt for the monastery and provide it with serf labour.\\" Three of the deeds of gift written by Stefan Dušan mention Vlachs together with Serbs where they are mentioned separately (\\"Vlachs as well as Serbs\\").Andre Du Nay; (1996) The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language p. 34; Matthias Corvinus Publishing, Granting monasteries with Vlachs continued during the reign of Emperor Stefan Uroš V (1355–71), in his charter as members of the Church of St. Nicholas in Hvosno, and 30 Vlach families as servants of Gračanica monastery, Kosovo. According to Croatian-Albanian historian Zef Mirdita, despite the fact that the \\"Vlach\\" exonym partially meant shepherds as a socio-professional category (regardless of ethnos), the individuality and identity of the Vlachs are seen in the Banjska and Dečani charters, as well as in Dušan's Code (1349). Therein is included a prohibition of intermarriage between Serbs and Vlachs, while after Emperor Dušan conquered a large part of southeast Europe (including Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly, that is Great Vlachia, and Albania, with significant Vlach population) he clearly differs Vlachs from Serbs and Albanians. An article provides that in the case of conflict between villagers it is punishable with a fine of 50 perper, while among Vlachs and Arbanasi of 100 perper. Another article, on the Vlachs and Arbanasi, prohibits the overnight stay by other shepherds in villages of Vlachs or Arbanasi, and in the case they did, have to pay for the amount their herds graze. Protection of his own Slav peasants by Dušan's Code forced many Vlachs migrated from Serbia.Endre Haraszti; (1977) Origin of the Rumanians (Vlach Origin, Migration and Infiltration to Transylvania) p. 60-61; Danubian Press, Dušan's charters of the Monastery of the Holy Archangels and Hilandar mention the Vlach duties of shepherding and giving sheep, up to two horses every year or 30 perper, as transporters for salt and other stuff monastery needs, mowing hay, and being construction workers. The medieval Vlachs in the Balkans had hybrid names, evidenting intermarriage with the Slavs. Legacy According to Sima Ćirković, documents from 13th to the 15th century show that the Vlachs were considered by the Serbs as \\"others\\" i.e. different from themselves, while documentation on that particular issue is scarce so it is very difficult to conclude how the difference is perceived.Sima M. Ćirković; (2008) Srbi među europskim narodima, (Serbs) p. 5; Golden marketing/ Tehnička knjiga; According to Andre Du Nay, written records from Serbia in the 13th to 15th century mention Albanians, Vlachs, but also and Serbians living in the same areas, although historical records from earlier periods do not exist certain cirumstances indicate that the Vlacho–Albanian symbiosis is of an ancient period.Andre Du Nay; (1996) The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language p. 45; Matthias Corvinus Publishing, See also *Morlachs *Vlach law *Vlachs in medieval Bosnia *Vlachs of Serbia *Vlachs of Croatia *Vlach (Ottoman social class) References Sources Further reading * Communities in medieval Serbia History of the Aromanians ","title":"Vlachs in medieval Serbia"},{"id":"46597282","text":"Benjamín Ayala Velázquez (born 7 October 1964) is a Mexican politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

The bridge has a single-rail track and two-lane highway that allows to completely divide automobiles and other traffic from trains. The bridge carries also a single- circuit 220 kV-powerline. Train service on the bridge began in 1975, while automobile traffic — in 1981. The bridge is a part of the railroad line Komsomolsk-on-Amur — Sovetskaya Gavan, and of the highway of regional significance R454 Khabarovsk — Komsomolsk-on-Amur.  History  In the period from June to September 1932, the first survey of the bridge across the Amur River on the future Baikal-Amur Mainline was conducted around the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, being under construction then. An exploration team of experts from the Institute Lengiprotransmost offered three main options of the crossing up to the village of Pivan' within the future city: above, below and within the city limits. Before the bridge was opened for traffic, a regular ferry service had operated. After the opening of the railway line Khabarovsk — Komsomolsk-on-Amur — Sovetskaya Gavan, the automobiles had to cross the Amur River by railway ferries: Project 723, Volga (until 1952 — The ferry number 1), Don (until 1952 — The ferry number 2), Amur and Komsomolsk. During the winter months, ice was additionally frozen, and crossing was possible along temporary rails over ice. Since 1961, the ferries were led by icebreakers to extend navigation in autumn and winter. Construction of the bridge started in 1969. In October 1974, the last pier was erected — as there were nine in number. The installation of the last span was finished on 1 August 1975. On 26 September 1975, the main bridge of the Baikal-Amur Mainline was solemnly opened to rail traffic. At midday, a passenger train from the station of Komsomolsk-on-Amur reached the first portal of the new bridge. The ferries that had operated here for more than 30 years said goodbye to Amur by emitting a series of long beeps.  Design  A project for the future bridge was developed in 1970 by the Design Institute \\"Lengiprotransmost\\" (LGTM) at the request of the USSR Transport Construction Ministry. The span structures of the bridge were designed for class S-14 loads, while the two-lane highway ― for class NC-80 and N-30 loads in compliance with current technical rules and building codes. The bridge's steelwork elements were designed for arctic service in the zone A. The construction works were carried out by the Komsomolsk work team MO-26 of the trust \\"Mostostroy-8\\". In fact, two spans of the single-rail track and two-lane highway are resting on the common ferro- concrete piers. The spans of the two-lane highway are fixed in the outboard supports (on the downstream side). The total length of the bridge, including approaches from abutment to abutment, was 1,435.32 metres. The height above the water edge was 24 metres. A catchment area was 1,730,000 km2. The Amur River Bridge The bridge with the 220 kV-powerline installed on it During construction in the period 1970-1971, a method of Prof. Konstantin Silin (1913–1996) was used for the first time in domestic practice of bridge building for erecting piers on the foundations of ferro-concrete sheaths with a diameter of 3 metres that excluded the use of the caissons that had been traditionally used in the construction of large and road-rail bridges of the Trans-Siberian railway. For anchoring the ferro-concrete sheaths into the bedrock, the reactive turbo-drilling method was applied for the first time in the world practice of bridge building. For this, a reactive turbodrilling machine of RTB-600 series was used. It consisted of three turbodrills for providing rotation of a rock-cutting tool in the form of roller cones. After immersion to the design elevation, the sheaths were filled with concrete by the tremie method. Next, the sheaths were combined by a reinforced concrete slab with the use of sheet piling, on which a pier's body was set in. The foundations of intermediate supports were manufactured of ferro-concrete sheaths with a diameter of 3 metres to a unified design by \\"Lengiprotransmost\\" with the use of concrete of Class М400 (B30) on durability and of Class F300 — on frost resistance, filled with underwater hydraulic monolithic concrete of Class M200 (B15). Reinforcing cages of rebar with a strength grade up to A-I and A-II (St5sp and St3sp steel grades) in diameter of 10 to 20 mm were embedded into the sheaths voids. In total, 304 sheaths were immersed during construction. The intermediate supports were massive prefabricated monolithic structures. They were dressed with granite slabs from the edges of the foundations up to the high-water level area and equipped with pointed ends on the upstream side serving as cutwaters (starlings) equipped with a vertical cutting surface. The bridge's sandstone masonry piers were quarried from the Kiesovsky and Trikratninsky deposits.  Military outposts  The bridge has become an important nodal point of the Baikal-Amur Mainline and a strategic- military objective. There are barbed wire entanglements into different rows, pillboxes, control towers on the left and right river banks near the bridge. Pedestrians and bicycles are forbidden on the bridge (other than in an organized column). There was also a military unit on the left bank at one time that had a reduced copy of the bridge used for exercises.

While playing rugby for Marist College he was selected in the Central Queensland Bushrangers team to play in the Queensland Junior State Championships. He returned to Brisbane for his senior high school years at Brisbane Boys College and St Patrick's College, Shorncliffe. Fakaosilea was selected for the Australian Schoolboys rugby team in 2012 and 2013. Fakaosilea is also a nephew of the former All Black rugby star Jonah Lomu, and he is briefly mentioned in Lomu's autobiography. Career Fakaosilea played premier grade rugby for the Sunnybank club. He was selected for the Australian Men's Youth Sevens team to play at the Youth Olympic Festival held at Sydney in 2013, before signing a one-year contract for the 2014 season, and then later on signing a further two-year contract with the Queensland Reds for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. In 2014, he played for the Reds A team in the Pacific Rugby Cup, and was selected for the Australia U20 team to play at the 2014 IRB Junior World Championship held in New Zealand. Later that year Fakaosilea was named in the Queensland Country squad for the National Rugby Championship, but was sadly side lined, after sustaining a torn meniscus which resulted in needing surgery. Fakaosilea made his Super Rugby debut for the Reds during the 2015 Super Rugby season, coming off the bench against the Hurricanes at Lang Park. He was selected again for the Australian Under 20 team in 2015.

It is located in the former Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, one of the only surviving 19th-century Acadian churches in northern Maine. The architecturally distinctive building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Architecture and building history The museum is located on the south side of United States Route 1 in the rural village center of Grand Isle. A former church, it is a large wood frame structure with a basically rectangular footprint, extended to the rear by additions. The main section of the building has a steeply pitched gable roof with a clerestory top. The building's most interesting features are found on the complex facade, which projects from the main section, and is divided into three sections. The outer sections are identical square towers, which rise two full stories to an open belfry supported by an arcade of eight Corinthian columns, which support a Baroque dome. The central section has three double-door entries, each surmounted with a half-round window, and topped by a gable at the first floor level. Most of the building's windows are narrow with round-arch topps, and consist of paired round-arch sections with a circular motif at the top. The upper Saint John River valley was settled by Acadians in the early decades of the 19th century, before the border between Maine and New Brunswick was fixed. When the border was set by the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty, the river became the border in this region, dividing the community. Acadians on the south side petitioned the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fredericton for their own church, which was built in 1848. In 1870 the parish was transferred to the Diocese of Portland. It was built in 1910 by Léonide Gagné, and its ancient Roman basilica interior was designed by Théophile Daoust. Due to high maintenance costs, the church was closed in 1978. Legal action following the closure prevented either its maintenance or rehabilitation until 1983. The following year a non-profit was established, which acquired the building from the diocese, and has since carefully restored it. Museum The former church now houses a collection of artifacts related to the Acadian history of the area, and is the site of cultural events. It is open to the public between June 15 and Labor Day.

After showing some promise as a juvenile, she showed marked improvement in the spring of 2015 and recorded her first major success in the 1000 Guineas. On her next appearance she was narrowly beaten when favourite for The Oaks. After another narrow defeat in the Pretty Polly Stakes she returned to top form to win the Nassau Stakes and the Matron Stakes Background Legatissimo is a bay filly with a large, diamond-shaped white star and white coronet markings on her hind legs bred by the Hertfordshire- based Newsells Park Stud. She was sired by Danehill Dancer, who won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Greenham Stakes before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Choisir, Mastercraftsman and Dancing Rain. Legatissimo's dam Yummy Mummy, won only one minor race at Sligo Racecourse from seven starts in 2007 and 2008, but was a full-sister to Fame and Glory, whose wins included the Irish Derby, Coronation Cup and Ascot Gold Cup. In October 2013, the yearling filly was sent to the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 330,000 guineas by Michael Vincent Magnier acting for the Coolmore organisation. The filly was sent into training with David Wachman at Goolds Cross, County Tipperary. Racing career 2014: two-year-old season Legatissimo began her racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 3 July and finished sixth of the even runners behind the odds-on favourite Pleascach. Later that month she started at odds of 12/1 for a similar event at Galway and recorded her first success, staying on well in the final furlong to win by half a length from Tamadhor. On her final appearance of the season she was moved up in class and distance for the Listed Flame of Tara Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 31 August. Ridden as in her two previous start by Wayne Lordan, she was made the 11/8 favourite, but was beaten three quarters of a lengths by the filly Jack Naylor (previously winner of the Silver Flash Stakes). The third placed Together Forever went on to win the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket in October. 2015: three-year-old season Spring On her three-year-old debut, Legatissimo contested the Group Three Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes on 12 April. Racing on very soft ground she never looked likely to win and finished fourth of the eight runners behind the Dermot Weld-trained Stormfly, beaten five and a half lengths by the winner. Two weeks later, the filly was moved up in distance for the Listed Victor McAlmont Memorial Stakes over nine and a half furlongs at Gowran Park. After racing towards the rear of the five- runner field, she moved forward in the straight, took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish, and drew away in the closing stages to win by three and three quarter lengths from Wedding Vow. On 3 May 2015, Legatissimo, ridden for the first time by Ryan Moore was one of thirteen fillies to contest the 202nd running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. She was made the 13/2 second favourite behind her fellow Irish challenger Lucida, winner of the Rockfel Stakes. She produced a very strong run in the last quarter mile to win by three quarters of a length from Lucida, with a gap of four and a half lengths back to the leading English filly Tiggy Wiggy in third. The winning time of 1:34.60 was the second fastest in the history of the race and almost a second faster than Gleneagles ran in the 2000 Guineas on the same course a day earlier. Wachman commented \\"She's a lovely, big scopy filly and Ryan gave her a nice ride. We've always liked her and we weren't concerned coming back in trip. We were worried we were running her back too quickly but we thought we'd take our chance. She'll get further but we'll discuss where we go next. She's a very good filly\\". Summer On 5 June, Legatissimo was moved up in distance and started 5/2 favourite for the 237th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. After turning into the straight in seventh place she looked unlikely to obtain a clear run but Moore forced her through the field to take the lead approaching the final furlong. Legatissimo opened up a clear advantage and looked likely to win but was caught in the last stride and beaten a short head by the 50/1 outsider Qualify. After the race Wachman said that the filly would be dropped back in distance for her subsequent races. At the end of the month she was matched against older fillies and mares and started 6/4 favourite for the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh. After losing her position she finished strongly but failed by a short head to catch Diamondsandrubies. Wachman offered no excuses and said that Legatissimo would probably reappear in the Nassau Stakes. The Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 1 August saw Legatissimo facing Diamondsandrubies again, whilst the other runners included Star of Seville (Prix de Diane), Arabian Queen, Cladocera (winner of two valuable races in Dubai), Wedding Vow (Kilboy Estate Stakes), Lady of Dubai (Height of Fashion Stakes) and Jazzi Top (Pretty Polly Stakes (Great Britain)). Ridden by Lordan for the first time since April, she started 2/1 favourite, with Diamondsandrubies the second choice on 100/30. After racing in mid-division, Legatissimo moved up on the outside entering the straight, took the lead approaching the final furlong and accelerated clear of the field to win by two and a quarter lengths from Wedding Vow. Arabian Queen finished third ahead of Cladocera, Jazzi Top and Lady of Dubai, all three of whom encountered interference in the final quarter mile. Wachman commented \\"She showed a really good turn of foot, just as she did in the Guineas, and I would say anything between a mile and 10 furlongs is ideal for her. There are plenty of options for her between now and the end of the year. We could think about taking on the boys, but I will have to speak to the owners first\\". Autumn At Leopardstown in September Legatissimo was matched against the British four-year-old Amazing Maria (winner of the Falmouth Stakes and the Prix Rothschild) in the Matron Stakes. The other seven runners included Brooch (Lanwades Stud Stakes), Euro Charline (Beverly D. Stakes), Cladocera, Ainippe (Brownstown Stakes) and Raydara (Debutante Stakes). Lordan positioned the filly just behind the leaders as Euro Charline set the pace before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. She accelerated clear of her opponents and won by two and a quarter lengths from Cladocera with Ainippe another two and a quarter lengths back in third. After the race Wachmn said \\"She is probably the best I've ever trained at this stage. She has been so good all year and this was probably her best performance. She travelled very well and she quickened once and put in bed. She is getting better as the year goes and we'd like to go to the Breeders' Cup with her now\\". Legatissimo ended her season with a trip to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf over nine and a half furlongs at Keeneland on 31 October. Ridden by Moore she started the 8/11 favourite against nine opponents. After stumbling at the start she settled in mid-division and finished well but was beaten a length and a quarter into second place by the six-year-old mare Stephanie's Kitten. On 10 November 2015, Legatissimo was named Cartier Champion Three-year-old Filly at the 25th edition of the Cartier Racing Awards. Legatissimo remained in training in 2016 but was retired without racing again after a training setback in April.

Life  Nothing is known of Conrad's early life. From no later than 1169 he was a Cistercian monk at Clairvaux. At some unknown date (perhaps 1206) he moved to Eberbach Abbey in the Rheingau, of which from 1 May 1221 he was abbot, and where he died in the same year.  Exordium  Conrad's single great work, the Exordium Magnum Cisterciense or Exordium magnum Ordinis Cisterciensis, in six books, concerns the early history of the Cistercians. Books 1-4 were written while he was still at Clairvaux, in the time of Abbot Garnier de Rochefort (1186-93); the last two were added at Eberbach, between 1206 and 1221. It is a book of instruction, on the theme of the early days and flowering of the Cistercians at Clairvaux, containing much information on significant persons (among them Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and other great Cistercian figures) and events in the life of the abbey and order. The book is one of the most effective monastic examples of this particular mediaeval literary genre combining historical narrative with exempla, miracles and visions, also represented by Caesarius of Heisterbach and . The Exordium was widely disseminated as a work of Christian spirituality by the Cistercians and also in the 15th century by the Dutch devotio moderna.  Quotation  To get acquainted with the Cistercian environment and its spirit, it is essential to become familiar with the Exordium magnum Ordinis Cisterciensis, a document of the highest value.

The announcement sparked protests by those opposed to Nkurunziza seeking a third term in office. Widespread demonstrations in the then-capital, Bujumbura, lasted for over three weeks. During that time the country's highest court approved Nkurunziza's right to run for a third term in office despite the fact that at least one of the court's judges fled the country claiming he had received death threats from members of the government. As a result of the protests the government also shut down the country's internet and telephone network, closed all of the country's universities and government officials publicly referred to the protesters as \\"terrorists\\". In April, tens of thousands of people fled the country, hundreds of people were arrested and several protesters and police officers were killed while dozens more were injured. On 13 May 2015, a coup was announced, led by Major General Godefroid Niyombare, while President Nkurunziza was in Tanzania attending an emergency conference about the situation in the country.Associated Press. 13 May 2015. Army General in Burundi Says President Is Ousted . By the next day the coup collapsed and government forces reasserted control. On 11 December, almost 90 people were killed in attacks on state targets. Background The Burundian Civil War lasted from 1993 to 2005, and an estimated 300,000 people were killed. The conflict ended with a peace process that brought in the 2005 constitution providing guaranteed representation for both Hutu and Tutsi, and parliamentary elections that led to Pierre Nkurunziza, from the Hutu FDD, becoming President. Since 2005, poverty has remained a major problem. According to the World Bank, over 60% of Burundians do not have enough food. The country's government does not have enough money to fund needed programs and the economy is reliant on coffee exports whose price has fluctuated radically in recent years and made long term financial planning nearly impossible. Constitutionality of a third term On 4 May 2015, the Vice-President of the Constitutional Court fled the country following alleged death threats from senior figures in the government. The judge claimed that most of the seven judges on the country's highest court believed it would be unconstitutional for Nkurunziza to be elected again. United States Secretary of State John Kerry also stated on 4 May that Nkurunziza's nomination \\"flies directly in the face of the constitution.\\" Following the departures of four of the seven judges who sit on Burundi's constitutional court (including the Vice- President), the remaining judges approved Nkurunziza's right to run for a third term in office. Members of the opposition described the court's ruling as \\"manipulated.\\" Critics of the president say his actions jeopardise a peace deal that has kept ethnic tensions in check since the Burundian Civil War ended in 2005 and that Nkurunziza is not constitutionally permitted to seek a third term in office; his supporters argue that his first 5-year term should not count because he was elected by a parliamentary vote rather than a popular vote. Protests and uprising First week of protests On 25 April 2015, the ruling CNDD-FDD announced that Nkurunziza would run for a third term in the 26 June 2015 presidential election. The announcement sparked protests by those opposed to Nkurunziza and those who claimed a third term would be a violation of the country's constitution which says no President can be elected more than twice. In the then-capital Bujumbura, protesters cut down trees to blockade roads. On 30 April, after days of protests, President Nkurunziza met with an American diplomat and told him that the protests were illegal. On 1 May, a grenade attack took place in Bujumbura and killed three people, including two policemen, and human rights organizations said that protesters had been beaten and arrested. On the same day, a speech by President Nkurunziza was broadcast, in which he stated that the protests were illegal, and a committee would be established and submit its findings before the June election, so that \\"severe sanctions will be taken against those who will be found guilty\\" of illegal activities. On 2 May, Security Minister, General Gabriel Nizigama said the protests were an \\"uprising\\" and that the demonstrators would be regarded as \\"criminals, terrorists and even enemies of the country\\". The International Red Cross says at least six people have been killed in the demonstrations, and Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights says that over 400 protesters have been detained, and some have been beaten in prison. Second week of protests Protests resumed on 4 May after a two-day suspension called for by protest leaders. Protests began peacefully but at least two protesters were shot and killed by police after stones were thrown at police. Attempted coup d'état President Pierre Nkurunziza, pictured in 2008 On 13 May 2015, Major General Godefroid Niyombare declared a coup d'état, announcing on radio that \\"Nkurunziza is dismissed, his government is dismissed too,\\" while President Nkurunziza was in Tanzania attending an emergency conference about the situation in the country.\\"Army general in Burundi says president is ousted\\" , Associated Press, 13 May 2015.

The government welcomed Rufyikiri's departure and alleged that he was involved in the failed coup attempt.\\"Burundi vice president flees, students break into US embassy\\" , AFP, 25 June 2015.

Ngendakumana said that the rebels were from his group. Post-election violence Shortly after the election was held on 21 July 2015, without the participation of the opposition, main opposition leader Agathon Rwasa proposed the formation of a national unity government, while warning of the potential for more violence and armed rebellion against Nkurunziza. As conditions for participating in such a government, Rwasa said that Nkurunziza's third term would need to be greatly truncated to no more than a year and new elections would have to be held, although he admitted that he doubted Nkurunziza would accept those conditions. He also urged those hoping to oust Nkurunziza through violence to instead focus on dialogue. The government welcomed the idea of forming a national unity government, but rejected the notion of truncating Nkurunziza's new term.Clement Manirabarusha and Edmund Blair, \\"Burundi opposition leader calls for unity government to avert conflict\\" , Reuters, 22 July 2015.

Aftermath  Although security forces successgully supressed unrest in Burundi, armed opposition militants continued to be active. FOREBU (later renamed to \\"Popular Forces of Burundi\\" or FPB) as well as RED-Tabara joined the FNL in the DR Congo, where they became involed in the Kivu conflict and began to clash with the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDAC). In October 2019, RED-Tabara launched a cross- border raid into Burundi. In the next month, unidentified militants ambushed Burundian Army soldiers at the Burundi-Rwanda border, resulting in accusations by the Brundian government that Rwanda was supporting local rebel groups. Refugees By 6 May 2015 the United Nations reported that 40,000 people had fled to seek safety in neighbouring Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. By 13 May at least an additional 10,000 people had fled. On 14 May the UN said that over 70,000 people had fled the country.

Reactions Domestic The government shut down Radio Publique Africaine and blocked instant messaging services and social media sites it said were used to co-ordinate protests. Reporters Without Borders condemned the restrictions on press and citizen communication. All universities were closed. On 30 December 2019 prosecutors called for sentences of 15 years each for 4 independent reporters who worked for Iwacu. Reporters Without Borders organised a petition on behalf of the four. =Military's response= On 2 May 2015, the Defence Minister, General Pontien Gaciyubwenge, said that the army was neutral and called for an end to attacks on citizens' rights.

Since 2016 the government has refused to share information or cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry on Burundi – twice threatening legal action against its members. Collective While the UN expressed alarm over the situation by mid- November, it was also joined by the United States, whose regional envoy, Tom Perriello, was to hold talks with regional states Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda. The International Criminal Court's Fatou Bensouda also threatened she would investigate allegations of war crimes. This came shortly after apparent incendiary rhetoric from the government. Senate President said the opposition would be \\"pulverize[d]\\" if they do not lay down arms before a 13 November 2015 deadline. \\"Today, the police shoot in the legs... but when the day comes that we tell them to go to 'work,' do not come crying to us.\\" (The phrase \\"work\\" was a euphemism used during the Rwandan genocide to describe committing acts of mass killing). Vice President Gaston Sindimwo similarly said: \\"Holiday time is over.\\" In criticising the rhetoric (similar to the lead up to the Rwandan Genocide by such outlets as RTLM), opposition leader Jeremiah Minani denounced the \\"messages of hate and division\\" and warned that \\"genocide is on its way.\\" The United Nations Security Council was due to meet on 9 November 2015 to discuss the crisis, at the behest of the French delegation, who also denounced the wave of \\"hate speech.\\" In October 2017, the International Criminal Court started an investigation into crimes in Burundi since April 2015.

Founded as an amateur team by migrants on 1981, Água Santa became one of the strongest non-professional teams in the ABC region, winning 17 titles during that time. On 8 December 2011, the team turned pro, joining the Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divisão in 2013. Água Santa won three consecutive promotions in their first years of professionalism, and by 2016, they were already in the top tier of the Campeonato Paulista. They were relegated back to Campeonato Paulista Série A2 after just one season in the top flight. They were promoted to the first division again for the 2020 season, and once again were relegated in the same year. Since the beginning of the professional era, Água Santa has played at Estádio Municipal José Batista Pereira Fernandes, better known as Arena Inamar. The club's home colours are white and blue and the team mascot is Neptune, the roman god of the sea. Their main rivals are São Bernardo, São Caetano and Santo André. Água Santa also had a troublesome off-field relationship with cross-town rivals Clube Atlético Diadema, which resulted in the latter team leaving for Ribeirão Pires. History  Amateur era (1981-2011)  Água Santa was founded by migrants from Northern Brazil, Northeastern Brazil and Minas Gerais on 27 October 1981 as an amateur team in the Eldorado neighborhood of Diadema, on a street called Estrada Água Santa, which is where the club got its name from. In the 2000s, the club grew into one of the powerhouses of the Diadema amateur football league. The club won the local third division in 2000 and the second division the following year. They finished second in the league in 2002 and 2003, and in 2004 they won the title for the first time. Água Santa were runners-up again in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, Água Santa played in the Copa Uniligas, an amateur cup contested by the best performing teams in the ABC region. They made it all the way to the finals, but ended up losing 1–0 to Santo André side União Vila Sá. Água Santa won three consecutive Diadema amateur football league titles from 2009 to 2011, establishing the team as the strongest in the city. Their amateur league games already attracted crowds of over 5,000 fans to Arena Inamar every sunday, and the team gained national attention after former Corinthians star Dinei, who had also played for Água Santa, wore the team's shirt during the fourth season of the A Fazenda reality show. As Diadema was one of the few larger cities in São Paulo that never had a professional football team, the club decided to turn pro, paying a R$ 600,000 fee to join the Federação Paulista de Futebol, quitting the amateur league in the process. Former footballer Capitão was chosen to be Netuno's director of football, and Paulo Sirqueira Korek Farias was the club's first (and so far only) president, with Revelino \\"Pretinho\\" Teixeira serving as the vice-president. The roman god of the sea Neptune was chosen to be the team's mascot due to their name (Holy Water, in Portuguese) and the club's proximity to the Billings dam. Their home stadium is also next to a Sabesp water tank facility.  Meteoric rise (2012-2016)  The club chose to take part only in youth tournaments in 2012. They played their first youth league games undear coach Lilló on 7 April 2014, against local rivals Santo André at Estádio Bruno José Daniel. The U15 clash ended in a goalless draw, while the U17 team lost 0–1. While the under-20 and under-17 sides were eliminated in the first stage of their respective leagues, the U15 Água Santa team performed better, reaching the third stage of the U-15 Campeonato Paulista in their first year. Márcio Ribeiro was hired to be Água Santa's manager in the 2013 Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divisão. Their first ever professional match game was held on 28 April 2013 at Baetão, in São Bernardo do Campo. Over 1,500 fans attended the match against EC São Bernardo, who took the lead in the 61st minute. Three minutes later, midfielder Lucas Limão scored Netuno's first ever professional goal, converting a penalty kick. He scored again in the 73rd minute, giving Água Santa their first ever league win. Água Santa played their first home game against crosstown rivals and fellow debutant side CAD on 4 May, losing 2–3 in front of a sold-out crowd. In spite of their local derby defeat, Água Santa's matches kept attracting large crowds and the club eventually won promotion to Série A3 on 13 October, following a 3–1 win against Cotia. The club also made it to the league finals against Matonense. Although Água Santa comfortably won the first leg 5–2, they lost the away leg 4–0 and had to settle for second place in their first ever professional league season. The team saw continued success in the 2014 Campeonato Paulista Série A3, finishing sixth in the first stage and achieving promotion for the second straight year, after finishing the second stage in second place in their group, which also featured Sertãozinho, São José dos Campos and eventual league winners Novorizontino. In the 2015 season, Água Santa finished fourth in Campeonato Paulista Série A2, achieving promotion once again, this time to the first tier of the São Paulo state league. Due to the club's arrival in the top flight, the Estádio Distrital do Inamar had to go through reconstruction, which increased the stadium capacity to 10,000 people. Rule changes for the 2016 Campeonato Paulista saw six clubs being relegated instead of the usual four, as the Federação Paulista de Futebol intended to decrease the number of participant clubs from 20 to 16. Água Santa had a decent start to the championship, winning three of the first five games, but soon after the team went into a six-game winless streak, putting Netuno in the relegation zone and resulting in the sacking of long-time manager Márcio Ribeiro after nearly four years in charge of the club. Márcio Bittencourt was appointed the new manager soon after. His first match in charge was against Palmeiras on 27 March. The game ended in a resounding 4–1 win for the Diadema side, which was called \\"a humiliation\\" by newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. The result of that match is now often used as a provocation against Palmeiras' fans by rivals and even by Água Santa itself multiple times. Despite the media repercussion, that would end up being their only win until the end of the tournament. On 2 April, Água Santa suffered their biggest defeat in history, a 7–2 thrashing by Ponte Preta at Moisés Lucarelli. A home loss to São Bernardo in the final matchday of the first stage, combined with a Botafogo win over Capivariano officially relegated Água Santa back to the second division for the 2017 season.  Later years (2016-)  Following their relegation, Água Santa took part in the Copa Paulista for the first time in 2016. Bittencourt was replaced by Edinho, who signed a one-year deal to be the new head coach. He left the club by mutual consent after just nine games in charge, and on 21 September, Fahel Júnior was appointed as the new manager. Under Fahel, Água Santa couldn't get past the second stage of the Copa Paulista. For the 2017 Campeonato Paulista Série A2, Jorginho was chosen to lead the club back to the top tier of the Paulistão. He was joined by former club manager Márcio Ribeiro, who was hired for a director role. The season started well for Água Santa, as the club finished the first stage leading the competition. They played Bragantino in the semifinals, and narrowly missed promotion, being eliminated in a penalty shoot-out. Their Copa Paulista run was also short-fated, as Água Santa again lost in the second stage. Jorginho remained at the helm for 2018, but unlike in the previous season, the club had a rough start in Série A2, which led to Jorginho's dismissal on 28 January. The same day, the club announced Toninho Cecílio as his replacement. Água Santa kept struggling under Cecílio, who was fired after failing to lead the club to a single win in six matches. With the club at the bottom of the table, Márcio Ribeiro returned to a coaching role for the remainder of the tournament, saving the club from relegation. Água Santa chose to field their U20 team in the 2018 Copa Paulista. Under Antônio Carlos Papel, the club did not perform well. They were eliminated in the first stage, finishing last in their group. With Ribeiro back in charge for the 2019 Campeonato Paulista Série A2, Água Santa returned to good form and finished the first stage at the top of the table. They beat Taubaté in both legs of the quarterfinals but lost to Santo André in the semifinals, which would cause them to miss promotion. However, the acquisition of Bragantino by Red Bull in the top flight automatically relegated Red Bull Brasil, as the same company is not allowed to have two clubs in the same division. This opened up a spot in the 2020 Campeonato Paulista, which went to Água Santa, who had finished third overall in the second tier. That would not be enough to keep Ribeiro in charge of the club for the Copa Paulista, as he was dismissed on 30 April 2019. Former Santo André head coach Fernando Marchiori was brought in to be in charge of the club in the cup. After finishing the first stage leading their group, Netuno's cup run ended in the second stage for the third time in four years. Água Santa had a bad start to the 2020 season, losing their first three Paulistão games without scoring a single goal. The poor run resulted in Fernando Marchiori's firing on 30 January 2020. Pintado was named his replacement for the remainder of the Campeonato Paulista. The new head coach led Água Santa to their first win of the year on February 8, against Ferroviária, and took the team out of the relegation zone. On 27 March, with the competition on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pintado left Água Santa for Brasileirão Série B side Juventude. On 30 June, it was reported that Toninho Cecílio would return for a second stint in charge of the club for the remaining two games of the tournament. Água Santa failed to get a win under Cecílio, and were relegated back to Série A2 at the end of the competition. Stadium Esporte Clube Água Santa play their home games at Estádio Distrital do Inamar.

These Saxons, or Sasi, had settled the Kingdom of Serbia during the reign of Stefan Uroš I (r. 1243–1276), from the Kingdom of Hungary. Under Stefan Uroš I, Serbia became a significant power in the Balkans, partly due to economic development through opening of mines. The mines were developed by the Sasi, who were experienced in the extracting of ore. Their settlements, located by the mines, had privileged status – they lived under their own laws and were allowed to adhere to Catholicism and build their churches. Mines included Brskovo, Novo Brdo, and others. Legacy The villages of Šašare and Sase, Srebrenica, and the Saška reka was named after the community.

In the US acceptable level of privacy is defined in terms of compliance to the functional and non-functional requirements set out through a privacy policy, which is a contractual artefact displaying the data controlling entities compliance to legislation such as Fair Information Practices, health record security regulation and other privacy laws. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation sets the requirements that need to be fulfilled. In the rest of the world, the requirements change depending on local implementations of privacy and data protection laws.  Definition and scope  The definition of privacy engineering given by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is: While privacy has been developing as a legal domain, privacy engineering has only really come to the fore in recent years as the necessity of implementing said privacy laws in information systems has become a definite requirement to the deployment of such information systems. For example, IPEN outlines their position in this respect as: Privacy engineering involves aspects such as process management, security, ontology and software engineering. The actual application of these derives from necessary legal compliances, privacy policies and \`manifestos' such as Privacy-by-Design. Relationship between PbD and Privacy Engineering Towards the more implementation levels, privacy engineering employs privacy enhancing technologies to enable anonymisation and de-identification of data. Privacy engineering requires suitable security engineering practices to be deployed, and some privacy aspects can be implemented using security techniques. A privacy impact assessment is another tool within this context and its use does not imply that privacy engineering is being practiced. One area of concern is the proper definition and application of terms such as personal data, personally identifiable information, anonymisation and pseudo-anonymisation which lack sufficient and detailed enough meanings when applied to software, information systems and data sets. Another facet of information system privacy has been the ethical use of such systems with particular concern on surveillance, big data collection, artificial intelligence etc. Some members of the privacy and privacy engineering communication advocate the idea of Ethics engineering or reject the possibility of engineering privacy into systems intended for surveillance. Software engineers often encounter problems when interpreting legal norms into current technology. Legal requirements are by nature neutral to technology, and will in case of legal conflict be interpreted by a court in the context of the current status of both technology and privacy practice.  Core practices  As this particular field is still in its infancy and somewhat dominated by the legal aspects, the following list just outlines the primary areas on which privacy engineering is based: * Data flow modelling * Semantics * Requirements engineering * Risk assessment * Privacy management and processes * Development of suitable terminologies/ontologies for expressing types, usages, purposes etc. of information * Privacy impact assessment Despite the lack of a cohesive development of the above areas, courses already exist for the training of privacy engineering. The International Workshop on Privacy Engineering co- located with IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy provides a venue to address \\"the gap between research and practice in systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues while engineering information systems\\". A number of approaches to privacy engineering exist. The LINDDUN methodology takes a risk-centric approach to privacy engineering where personal data flows at risk are identified and then secured with privacy controls.Wuyts, K., & Joosen, W. (2015). LINDDUN privacy threat modeling: a tutorial. CW Reports.https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/331950, accessed 2019-12-10 Guidance for interpretaton of the GDPR has been provided in the GDPR recitals, which have been coded into a decision tool that maps GDPR into software engineering forces with the goal to identify suitable privacy design patterns. One further approach uses eight privacy design strategies - four technical and for administrative strategies - to protect data and to implement data subject rights.  Aspects of information  Privacy engineering is particularly concerned with the processing of information over the following aspects or ontologies and their relations to their implementation in software: * Information Type Ontologies (as opposed to PII or machine types) * Data Processing Ontologies * Semantics of information and data sets (see also noise and anonymisation) * Provenance of information, including the notion of data subject * Usage of information * Purpose of information, viz: primary vs secondary collection * Notions of controller and processor * The notions of authority and identity (ostensibly of the source(s) of data) Further to this how the above then affect the security classification, risk classification and thus the levels of protection and flow within a system can then the metricised or calculated.  Definitions of privacy  As already stated, privacy is an area dominated by legal aspects but requiring implementation using, ostensibly, engineering techniques, disciplines and skills. Privacy Engineering as an overall discipline takes its basis from considering privacy not just as a legal aspect or engineering aspect and their unification but also utilising the following areas: * Privacy as a philosophical aspect * Privacy as an economic aspect, particular game theory * Privacy as a sociological aspect Legal basis The impetus for technological progress in privacy engineering stems from general privacy laws and various particular legal acts: *Privacy Act of 1974 *Privacy Protection Act of 1980 *Video Privacy Protection Act *Online Privacy Protection Act *Children's Online Privacy Protection Act *Driver's Privacy Protection Act *Intimate Privacy Protection Act *Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006 *General Data Protection Regulation  See also  * Data Protection Directive * Information security * Risk management * Free and open MOOC course module on privacy by design and management with Karlstad University's Privacy by Design on-line course .

The fortress is located close to the Wisłoujście borough, Westerplatte and the Port Północny (Northern Port). Description Different parts of the fortress ar clearly in different architectural styles (predominantly Gothic) and in different styles of construction and building materials. This is the result of the fortress being rebuilt every time it was destroyed or badly damaged. The basement and foundation of the fortress is based on wooden crates (kaszyce), which are hidden underneath in the water. On top of these structures, rubble was heaped up and strengthened - providing a stable and strong base for the fortress. The heart of the fortress is based around a circular tower (currently devoid of the coping), which until 1785 was used as a lighthouse. The lighthouse is surrounded by a brick flange (also known as a circular battery), whose inner walls are sealed together with the officers' living quarters. Around the battery there is a four-bastion Fort Carré, which is led by a gatehouse with a postern from 1609. The north-western side of the fort-carré is adjoined to the Martwa Wisła river, while the rest of the fortress is separated off from land by a sconce known as the Szaniec Wschodny (Eastern Sconce). The sconce is lined up with five bastions, two of which are ravelins - one of which survived. The Fort carré as well as the Eastern Sconce are surrounded by a moat, sourced by the Martwa Wisła river. Up until 1889, the lighthouse tower was topped with a later-Baroque coping, from about 1721. After its burning, due to a fire caused by lightning, the coping was reconstructed and coated with shale, which survived up until 1945. The tower had formerly a clock, dating back to the eighteenth century. In 1945, due to artillery strikes the tower was almost completely destroyed, the coping and officers' headquarters and upper levels were also devastated. The only parts of the fortress which were left untouched, were the walls of the Fort Carré. In 1959 the tower was added to the Register of Heritage Sites, and reconstruction of the fortress began.

Hedding, painted in colour by Johann Gelentin in the first quarter of the eighteenth century During the times of the Teutonic Order, in the fourteenth century, a wooden fortress stood by the mouth of the river Vistula, flowing into the Baltic Sea; which was burnt down by a Hussite Sirotci raid, in September, 1433. In 1482, a brick lighthouse tower was built in place of the former fortress. The tower was assigned to control the passage of ships, traveling to and from the Bay of Gdańsk's main port city of Gdańsk. The Wisłoujście Fortress was target for military campaigns. In 1577 the fortress was besieged several times by Stefan Batory, inconclusively, during the Battle of Oliwa (1627), when the fortress was cannonaded by a Swedish fleet; in 1734 by Russian-Saxon, in 1793 by Prussian, in 1807 by Napoleonic, and once again in 1814 by Prussian fleets. Between 1622-1629 the fortress was known as Latarnia (Lighthouse, Polish), under the name of a fortress - while actually being a naval base of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. On the night of July 5–6, 1628, the fortress was attacked with artillery fire, from a Swedish fleet traveling from Wisłoujście, into the fortress, sinking the vessel Złoty Lew (Golden Lion, Polish), and a galleon.

The operation of mass expulsions from Zamojszczyzna region around the city of Zamość (now in Lublin Voivodeship, Poland) was carried out between November 1942 and March 1943 on direct order from Heinrich Himmler. Source: Bulletin of IPN issue 05/2004.

According to historical sources the German police and military expelled 116,000 Polish men and women in just a few months during Action Zamość. Genesis Czesława Kwoka – one of many Polish children from the region murdered in Auschwitz Wartime fate of the Polish children from Zamojszczyzna was closely related to the German plans for the expansion of their own so-called \\"living space in the East\\", part of a broader Nazi policy called the Generalplan Ost. The plans for \\"ethnically cleansing the land\\" of its inhabitants were created in the fall of 1941 in Berlin and were closely connected with the idea of the new great consolidation of German nationhood. Country-wide actions dubbed Heim ins Reich (\\"Home to the Reich\\") were conducted across all of Central and Eastern Europe (see Action Saybusch in Polish Silesia). Their main purpose was to transplant colonists of the German origin from Russia, Romania, and other countries, to occupied Poland. At the beginning of war, the programme was mainly realised in western parts of Poland, including Wielkopolska, Eastern Silesia and Danzig-Westpreußen already controlled by Nazi Germany; but after Operation Barbarossa, it was continued throughout the General Government. In order to prepare the land for the new German settlers, both German military and all branches of police including Sonderdienst, aided by the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police battalions, conducted mass deportations of native Polish inhabitants using Holocaust trains as well as lorries and even horse-drawn wagons. Zamojszczyzna was recognized as one of the core German settlement areas in Distrikt Galizien, and according to the order of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler became the first intervention target in the region. Ukrainians were transferred to villages on the perimeter of German colonies to provide a buffer zone protecting the German settlers from Polish partisans. The forcible depopulation of Zamość region Expulsions of Poles from the Zamość region in December 1942 Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, and, in the euphoric atmosphere surrounding its initial victories, the Aktion Zamosc was first outlined by Himmler together with Governor Hans Frank who initially requested that the programme be delayed until complete victory, but was convinced otherwise. In accordance with the General Plan East, the first forcible removal of the 2,000 inhabitants from selected villages was conducted between 6th and 25 of November 1941, while the general deportation programme began a year later on the night of 27–28 November 1942 in Skierbieszów and its vicinity. By then, the murderous Operation Reinhard was already in full swing. The expulsions encompassed the districts of Hrubieszów, Tomaszów Lubelski, Zamość and Biłgoraj, and were completed in March 1943. In total 297 Polish villages were depopulated. A concentration camp was created in Zamość around the streets of Piłsudskiego and Okrzei. Initially, it was a transit camp for Soviet POWs, rebuilt and expanded with 15 new barracks added for the imprisonment of rounded up families. SS-Unterscharführer Artur Schütz was appointed the camp's commandant. From there, transports of children no older than 14 years of age – whose names have already been Germanized – were sent elsewhere. Historians estimate that 116,000 people in total were forcibly removed from Zamojszczyzna, among them 30,000 children. Deportations to concentration camps The camp in Zamość (pl), located on S. Okrzei street, served as the transit point for selections and further deportations. In the first month of Action Zamość the camp processed 7,055 Polish inhabitants of 62 villages. People were divided into four main categories with the following code letters: \\"WE\\" (re-Germanization), \\"AA\\" (transport to the Reich), \\"RD\\" (farm-work for the settlers), \\"KI\\" (Kindertransport), \\"AG\\" (work in the General Government); and finally, \\"KL\\" (concentration camp). Those expelled from Zamojszczyzna to perform slave labour in Germany were loaded onto trains departing for temporary displacement camps governed by main resettlement HQ in Łodź. People from the last group were sent to the Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Majdanek. The camp in Zamość processed 31,536 Poles according to Germany's own records, or 41,000 based on postwar estimates. Dispossessed Polish families were sent to other transit camps as well including Zwierzyniec in the Zamość County, which processed 20,000-24,000 Poles (12,000 between July and August 1943).Jaczyńska 2012, p. 33 (4 / 5 in PDF). Transit camps existed in Budzyń, Frampol, Lublin (on Krochmalna street), Stary Majdan, Biłgoraj County, Tarnogród, Wola Derezieńska, Old Wedan, Biłgoraj and also in Puszcza Solska. Race selections based on forcible abduction of children from their parents were conducted in all of them. The term \\"Children of Zamojszczyzna\\" originates from the multitude of those locations. Polish girls at a Nazi-German camp in Dzierżązna near Zgierz. Among the prisoners were children resettled from Zamojszczyzna (1942-1943) Children suffered the most in those camps. The average stay lasted several months. Starvation, cold, disease were fatal for them a lot more often than for adults. Separated from their parents, children were transported in cattle wagons (100 up to 150 children in one wagon) to other destinations. Many of them were sent to a Kinder KZ (concentration camp for children) run side-by-side with the Łódź Ghetto. Kinder KZ processed up to 13,000 children. News about enormous drama of children from Zamojszczyzna quickly spread through entire country. Polish railwayman were forwarding messages about transports to inhabitants of the cities where transports were stopping by. There were several stations where residents took a chance and risked rescuing the children, like in Sobolew, Żelechów, Siedlce, Garwolin, Pilawa and Warsaw. Another deportation action, called Operation Werwolf, was conducted during the summer of 1944 ahead of the Soviet advance. Many of the inhabitants were forced to evacuate after being previously transferred into these areas by Germany as early as 1939. Entire families ended up in concentration camps at Majdanek (up to 15,000 prisoners of Action Zamość) and Auschwitz, before deportation to forced labour in the Reich. At Majdanek, due to severe overcrowding, entire train-loads were kept in open fields numbered from III to V.
