Excavations in 1998 uncovered forty-six earthenware fragments which have been dated as early as 14,500 BC (ca 16,500 BP); this places them among the earliest pottery currently known. As the earliest in Japan, this marks the transition from the Japanese Paleolithic to Incipient J≈çmon. Other pottery of a similar date has been found at Gasy and Khummy on the lower Amur River. Such a date puts the development of pottery before the warming at the end of the Pleistocene. Overview The Odai Yamamoto I site is located on a fluvial terrace at an altitude of on the left bank of the Kanita River that flows into Mutsu Bay on the eastern side of the Tsugaru Peninsula. Pottery shards found during the rebuilding of a private residence in 1998 were submitted for radiocarbon dating by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education, and were found to have been produced 16,500 years ago, making it the oldest known pottery in the world at that time. A total of was excavated in 1998. Further finds included axes, spearheads, arrowheads, scapers, blades, and anvils, mostly of local shale but some also of obsidian. The arrowheads are of special significance as they push back the beginnings of the history of archery. As no indication of permanent dwellings have been found at the site, it is assumed that the ancient inhabitants of this area were still nomadic. The site forms part of a serial nomination submitted in 2009 for future inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List, under criteria iii and iv: J≈çmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid≈ç, Northern T≈çhoku, and other regions. Work began on the site in 2019 to improve public access to a section of the excavated area. Dating Thirty of the forty-six fragments of pottery, all from the same vessel, had carbonized residues, suggesting its use for the cooking of foodstuffs. Eight AMS radiocarbon dates were generated from five of the fragments and three pieces of associated charred wood; these suggested a date of 11,800 to 11,500 BC. With calibration, this dating was pushed back to 14,500 to 14,000, as early as around 16,500 BP. Other datings have given a range between 13780 ¬± 170 and 12680 ¬± 140 BC. This makes the Odai Yamamoto I site important to the understanding of the transition between the Pleistocene and the Holocene. In recognition of their importance, the excavated artifacts have been designated a Municipal Cultural Property. Stoneware and pottery excavated from the Odai Yamamoto I site is preserved at the Oyama Furusato Museum at Oyama Elementary School. The site received protection as a National Historic Site of Japan in 2013.

It is a graduate school of New York University focusing on urban informatics. It opened in September 2013, and is located in NYU's 370 Jay St. building in Downtown Brooklyn.  History and background  In July 2011, Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a request for proposals to all universities worldwide to build an engineering and applied sciences campus in New York City. The winner(s) of this competition would receive significant funding from the city in order to build this campus. NYU submitted a proposal to build a school of applied urban science in Downtown Brooklyn, in an underused MTA building, with the aim of confronting the world's pressing urban challenges. The proposal was declared the second winner in April 2012 by Mayor Bloomberg after various negotiations with the city government and the MTA. During the celebration ceremony, Steve Koonin was named as the director of CUSP. Campus CUSP will be located at 370 Jay Street in a building along with other academic units of NYU,https://www.nyu.edu/about/news- publications/budget/capital-budget.html once the old MTA equipment in the building is removed and the building is completely renovated. In the meantime, NYU established CUSP in leased space in MetroTech and classes began in September 2013. The projected year of completion for the permanent building is 2017. Academics CUSP teaches the principles and scientific investigative tools and techniques to interrogate and combine city datasets to tackle real urban challenges. Subjects developed for CUSP's curricula include urban engineering, civil engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. Besides students accepted directly to CUSP, graduate students from other schools of NYU will be invited to study at CUSP, as well as students from CUSP's partner universities, which include Carnegie Mellon University, CUNY, The Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay, The University of Toronto, King's College London, and The University of Warwick. CUSP will also have industry partners to assist with research, which include IBM, Cisco, Siemens, Con Edison, National Grid, Xerox, Arup, IDEO, and AECOM. CUSP offers a M.S. degree in Applied Urban Science and Informatics, and an Advanced Graduate Certificate program. The M.S. program also has a track in Civil Analytics, and an extended (2 year) form to allow students to meet full-time degree requirements on a part-time basis. CUSP's inaugural class of 23 students was inducted on August 26, 2013, and graduated in July 2014. CUSP's second cohort of 64 students graduated in July 2015. The class of 2016 had 89 students. CUSP sponsored and contributed to \\"Big Data, Privacy, and the Public Good: Frameworks for Engagement\\", a pioneering book on the intersection of big data, privacy and the public.

The film was directed by Bart Layton. It includes interviews with Bourdin and members of Barclay's family, as well as archive television news footage and reenacted dramatic sequences.  Summary  Bourdin, who turned out to have a long record of impersonating various children, real or imaginary, embellished his claim to be Nicholas Barclay by alleging that he had been kidnapped for purposes of sexual abuse by Mexican, European, and U.S. military personnel and transported from Texas to Spain. His impersonation fooled several officials in Spain and the U.S., and he was apparently accepted by many of Barclay's family members, even though he was seven years older than Barclay, spoke with a French accent, and had brown eyes and dark hair rather than Barclay's blue eyes and blonde hair. The impersonation was eventually discovered as a result of the suspicions of a private investigator, Charles (Charlie) Parker, and an FBI agent, Nancy Fisher. Bourdin subsequently made a full confession, and in the film he elaborates on the various stages in his impersonation. Layton said of Bourdin: \\"He invites sympathy. He has this childlike quality about him, and he can be very charming. And at other times he can be quite repellent, because he can be remorseless and you're reminded about what he did. So as a filmmaker, I was asking: how can I find a way of getting the audience to experience a bit of that?\\"  Credits  ;Interviews * Fr√©d√©ric Bourdin * Carey Gibson * Beverly Dollarhide * Bryan Gibson * Codey Gibson * Nancy Fisher * Charlie Parker * Bruce Perry, M.D., Ph.D * Philip French ;Drama sequences * Adam O'Brian as Fr√©d√©ric Bourdin * Anna Ruben as Carey Gibson * Cathy Dresbach as Nancy Fisher * Alan Teichman as Charlie Parker * Ivan Villanueva as Social Worker * Maria Jesus Hoyos as Judge * Ant√≥n Mart√≠ as Male Police Officer * Amparo Fontanet as Female Police Officer * Ken Appledorn as U.S. Embassy Official Production RAW Production produced the film with Red Box Films and Passion Pictures.

She was one of thirteen similar vessels, known to Sydney siders as the 'Hollywood Fleet'. Steady Hour was built by Lars Halvorsen and Sons in 1940 for Fred Harris. This was the second vessel of the same name built for Harris. She was requisitioned and later commissioned by the RAN on 26 August 1941 under the command of Lieutenant Athol G Townley. Steady Hour was armed with .303 Vickers machine guns fore and aft and depth charge racks on the stern. During the Battle of Sydney Harbour (often referred to as the Attack on Sydney Harbour) on 31 May and 1 June 1942, Steady Hour, having received orders at 3:10am, got underway from her mooring in Farm Cove and proceeded to patrol the harbour towards the boom net. At approx. 5:00am, her sister ship HMAS Seamist attacked midget submarine M-21 in Taylors Bay. Steady Hour proceeded to the scene and conducted further searches. At approx. 6:40am, a 'contact' was obtained by another sister ship, HMAS Yarroma, on which Steady Hour proceeded to drop further depth charges. The submarine was later salvaged. Whilst credit for its destruction was initially given to Steady Hour, it is now accepted the submarine had been destroyed by the earlier attack of HMAS Seamist. For her role during the Battle of Sydney Harbour, Steady Hour was awarded the Battle Honour \\"Pacific 1942\\". It appears she spent a considerable period of time in Sydney following the battle, before relocating to Port Kembla in November 1943. In April 1944, she was refitted in Sydney, (458) and arrived in Darwin via Thursday Island and Melville Bay on 22 May 1944 in company with HMAS Seamist. On 26 February 1945, she departed Darwin with Seamist and Alma Doepel for Thursday Island and further south for refit. On 3 March 1945 whilst refueling at Melville Bay, 650km east of Darwin, Steady Hour was destroyed by fire whilst refueling. The commanding officer of Steady Hour, John Sykes was badly burnt, and together with the engineer and telegraphist, were taken to hospital. The subsequent Board of Inquiry recorded their appreciation of the action taken by Percy Allan, a sailor from Seamist who despite being unable to swim, dived into the shark infested waters to rescue Leading Seaman Piper.

The Apostolic Palace, Vatican. The Redemptoris Mater Chapel (Latin for Mother of the Redeemer) formerly known as Matilde Chapel, is a Roman Catholic chapel located on the second floor of the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City. Located just outside the doors of the papal apartments, the chapel is notable for its various mosaics similar to early Byzantine religious artwork,http://persicousa.com/Redemptoris_Mater.html and is reserved for the exclusive use of the Pope. The cost of renovation for the chapel itself was a gift from the College of Cardinals to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's sacerdotal ordination in 1996.https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/documents/ns_lit_doc_14111999_notificazione_en.html The current Apostolic Preacher, Capuchin Friar Father Raniero Cantalamessa often presides over the homilies in the chapel, which was occasionally used by Pope Benedict XVI. History The chapel was first called the Matilde Chapel but was renamed at the request of Pope John Paul II in 1987 for his 50th sacerdotal ordination. The timing also coincided with the same year when the traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches became more notable in the Church, as illustrated in the book Liturgie dell'Oriente cristiano a Roma nell'Anno Mariano 1987-1988. The chapel began its renovations in late 1996 and was dedicated by Pope John Paul II on November 14, 1999. Pope John Paul II viewed the chapel as an ecumenical symbol for the various Eastern and Western churches who unite themselves in the papacy. He noted that the chapel has a particular ecumenical value and serves as an important presence of the Eastern tradition in the Vatican.https://www.vatican.va/redemptoris_mater/index_en.htm The author of the iconographic program of the chapel mosaics is Professor .https://rublev-museum.livejournal.com/145769.html - Commentario allo schizzo del mosaico per la capella papale (Vaticano) The first of the four walls were completed by a Russian Orthodox artist, Alexander Kornoukhov.

Wigle Whiskeys are the flagship products of the Pittsburgh Distilling Company, LLC, which is entirely family owned and operated. History Wigle began operations in 2011, and opened its doors to the public in March of 2012. Wigle was the first distillery to open in Pittsburgh since Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s. At that time, only two other distilleries existed in the rest of Pennsylvania. The founders of Wigle Whiskey were instrumental to the passage of Pennsylvania House Bill 242 in December 2011, establishing a new distillery license allowing craft distilleries to sell their own products onsite, which led to the growth of craft distilleries in Pennsylvania. The bill allowed Wigle to sell spirits to customers. Wigle purchased the distillery building and a neighboring building in early 2019 to provide more room for tasting, tours, whiskey production, and community programs. Wigle's founders, Mark Meyer, Mary Ellen Meyer, Meredith Meyer Grelli, Eric Meyer, Alexander Grelli, and Jeff Meyer, named the distillery after Philip Wigle, a man convicted of treason in 1794 and sentenced to hang for his actions in the Whiskey Rebellion, wherein Alexander Hamilton leveled the first excise tax--on whiskey. Wigle punched a tax collector, helping to incite four years of protests and riots that would come to be known as the Whiskey Rebellion. Wigle was later pardoned by George Washington. Washington feared hanging Wigle would stir a civil war in the young nation. Wigle Whiskey was at the center of the \\"Pennsylvania Rye Revival\\" and the growth of Pittsburgh's whiskey heritage tourism.Przybylek (2017) describes how historical views of the Whiskey Rebellion changed over time. Historians and organizers of civic commemorations of the Whiskey Rebellion tended to see rebellion in negative terms up until the 1960s, when progressive historical scholarship produced more positive perspectives on dissent. By 2008, a marketing firm called Brandmill was able to create the \\"Whiskey Rebellion II\\" campaign against a drink tax imposed by the Allegheny County government on Pittsburgh area restaurants, taverns and banquet halls (see and ). Wigle Whiskey led the growth of whiskey and rye heritage tourism in western Pennsylvania. The distillery offers tours, which include a history of the Whiskey Rebellion. Owners Mark Meyer and Meredith Meyer Grelli are authors of _The Whiskey Rebellion & the Rebirth of Rye_ (Belt, 2017), which describes rye's origins and the history of Pittsburgh, and provides a guide to making rye whiskey and recipes for cocktails. In 2018, Wigle partnered with Pittsburgh's Heinz History Center on a Prohibition Rye whiskey to accompany the museum's \\"American Spirits: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition\\" exhibition. Wigle has also partnered with other museums, including the Mattress Factory and the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Museum in Cumberland, Maryland, and the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Wigle is also involved in the development of a Whiskey Rebellion trail following the Great Allegheny Passage, a trail that extends from Pittsburgh, through Pennsylvania and Maryland to Mt. Vernon. Wigle partnered with the Omni Bedford Springs Hotel in Bedford, Pennsylvania, a town about 100 miles southeast of Pittsburgh where Washington led his troops during the Whiskey Rebellion. Wigle‚Äôs annual ‚Äútar and feathering‚Äù party (a part of the Whiskey Rebellion Heritage Festival) raises money for nonprofits. In 2013, the Meyer family opened a new facility in the Northside area of Pittsburgh, the Wigle Whiskey Barrelhouse and Garden. A former produce warehouse, the barrelhouse provided a place for tastings and tours. The family also purchased two vacant lots neighboring the barrelhouse for gardens for botanicals used in the spirits. In April 2017, Wigle opened a cocktail bar and bottle shop, the Wigle Whiskey Tasting Room, at the Omni William Penn Hotel. In 2018, Wigle opened a Tasting Room and Bottle Shop in Ross Park Mall. During the holiday shopping season, Wigle also runs pop-up kiosks in Pittsburgh's South Hills Village Mall. Wigle holds weekly labeling parties every Tuesday, where guests label bottles in exchange for drinks. Process Wigle Whiskey production area, prior to expansion Wigle is an organic \\"grain-to-glass\\" distiller, which means that the distillery obtains ingredients from nearby farms in Washington County, Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, mills grains on site, where they are distilled, and serves them at the distillery. The Meyer family worked with the Artisan Distilling Program at Michigan State University throughout the start up of the distillery. Wigle distills their whiskey from scratch. Wigle led a two year study into regional terroir by producing batches of Rye Whiskey from rye grain sourced from farms in Saskatchewan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. The distillery found differences in the tastes and compounds of the resulting whiskies that could be traced back to the regional grains used in the process. Products Kilted Rye & Deep Cut Wigle Whiskey produces Organic Straight Rye Whiskeys, Organic Straight Bourbons, Dutch Style Gins, Rum and Bitters. Wigle's Bourbon was the first bourbon produced in Pennsylvania in more than 40 years. In March, 2020, Wigle began manufacturing hand sanitizer for Pittsburgh's first responders to help ease coronavirus- induced shortages. Awards Wigle co-founders Alex Grelli and Meredith Meyer Grelli were named James Beard Award Semi-Finalists in 2018. In 2018, Wigle Whiskey's Organic Ginever was awarded Best in Class Gin by the American Craft Spirits Association. Its Bourbon won a Gold medal and the Distillery was awarded an additional 16 medals across its portfolio, making it the most awarded craft distillery in the country by the American Craft Spirits Association for the second year running.

Membership ISPI has both a US and international membership base with members in more than 53 countries. In addition to the international organization ISPI sponsors local chapters in major cities through the United States and Canada and has affiliates in Europe, Africa, and Asia as well as members in South America and Australia. The association‚Äôs members work in various types of organizations, including business, industry, government, military, education (K-12 and post-secondary), non-profit and as independent consultants. Professional Standards and Ethics With its roots in the 1960s, Human Performance Technology (HPT), sometimes known as Human Performance Improvement (HPI), grew primarily from behavioral psychology and Instructional Systems Design (ISD). Nowadays HPT also draws from many other disciplines such as Human Factors, quality improvement, process improvement, Instructional and Educational Technologies, Organization Development, motivation and reward research, training research to change performance and achieve worthy outcomes. (See ISPI, 2007.) HPT aims to overcome problems and address opportunities for improved outcomes at societal, organizational, process and individual levels. It uses systemic, rigorous analytical processes to identify and define requirements for change, determine existing obstacles and potential facilitators for specified changes, and select and develop appropriate interventions to improve outcomes. Following tenets of evidence-based practice, HPT also initiates and implements interventions effectively to achieve meaningful and sustained change in outcomes throughout their life cycle. Evaluation is also a central aspect of HPT, and is used during planning, carrying out, and following up interventions by measuring results against identified requirements. In 2002 ISPI convened a group of workplace managers, business consultants, and academics met to define what skills and abilities a performance technology practitioner needed. That group established a set of ten standards of performance: ISPI Standards of Performance Technology #Focus on Results, #Take a Systems View, #Add Value, #Utilize Partnerships, #Systematically Assess the Opportunity or Need, #Identify the Factors That Limit Performance, #Design the Solution or the Speciation for the Solution, #Create (Develop) the Solution, #Implement the Solution, and #Evaluate the Process and Its Results. That set of standards was validated in a subsequent study conducted by graduate students at Indiana University. Lauer, M.J. (2008) Validating the ISPI standards and principles for the Certified Performance Technologist. INDIANA UNIVERSITY In addition to the ten standards, ISPI created a code of ethics ISPI Code of Ethics as a guide for its members. This set of standards and code of ethics are a basis for ISPI‚Äôs Certified Performance Technologist credential (CPT). ISPI CPT Certification The CPT designation permits individuals to demonstrate proficiency in the ten Standards of Performance Technology. This demonstration enables employers and clients to determine the qualifications and applied skills of a performance improvement professional with a standardized measurement. The certification indicates that the CPT has demonstrated that her or his work results in measurable positive impact in the workplace. The certification also provides the CPT with the means to promote his or her skills and experience. Since the certification is performance-based, not education-based, individuals who demonstrate proficiency in ten Standards of Performance Technology and commit to the ISPI Code of Ethics can be certified regardless of their educational background. Re-certification is required every three years thus demonstrating ongoing learning, growth and professional development About ISPI The mission of ISPI is to advance the field of Human Performance Technology, advocate its application, and enhance the skills and professional standing of its practitioners. ISPI‚Äôs stated vision is that ‚Äúour technology will be recognized as the premier approach to improving the performance of people, groups and organizations and that we who competently apply it will be widely recognized by employers and clients as reliable sources of significant value‚Äù. The roots of ISPI began on January 29, 1962 at the Randolph Air Force Base Officers‚Äô Club in San Antonio, Texas, during a dinner meeting held to organize the Programmed Learning Society. The stated purpose of the Society was to collect, develop, and diffuse information concerned with programmed instruction. NSPI/ISPI Interactive Timeline In March 1962 the Society adopted a new name‚ÄîNational Society for Programmed Instruction (NSPI) and a constitution was adopted. ibid In 1973 the name was changed to National Society for Performance and Instruction to reflect a broader interest in improving workplace performance using solutions that are both instructional and non-instructional (job-aids, work redesign, process improvement, etc.). ibid In 1992 the Human Performance Technology (HPT) model was developed ibid to reflect the work of Thomas Gilbert, one of the founders of the field of human performance improvement and a long-time member of NSPI. ibid That same year the Handbook of Human Performance Technology edited by Harold Stolovitch and Erica Keeps was co-published with Jossey-Bass, Inc. to provide readers with the first comprehensive guide to the fundamental knowledge necessary to improve human performance in the workplace. ibid In June 1995 the membership voted to change the name to the International Society for Performance Improvement. ibid With members living and working in more than 30 countries, it was felt that ISPI more accurately reflected the breadth and geographic diversity of the membership and acknowledged the wide variety of interventions that comprise human performance technology. That same year the Board approved funding to establish the ISPI Book Program. The book program better positioned ISPI as the primary source of information about HPT. In 1996 the Board approved the development of a Research Endowment, investing $150,000 with the interest being used to fund research projects. ibid The fund‚Äôs support of research to advance the field of human performance ensured ISPI‚Äôs continuing leadership as the primary disseminator of performance improvement information. In 1999 the Principles & Practices Institute debuted at Annual Conference. The three-day Institute was designed disseminate the integration of HPT models, concepts, and research findings through the analysis of real cases for the first time. The Handbook for Human Performance: Improving Individual and Organizational Performance Worldwide (2nd Edition) edited by Erica Keeps and Harold Stolovitch debuted at Annual Conference in 1999. The revised Handbook focused on the global nature of HPT.  Continuing Professional Education ISPI hosts an annual conference in major cities in the U.S. and Canada. The ISPI EMEA affiliate hosts an annual conference in Europe. Additional educational events include pre-conference one- and two-day workshops, a monthly webinar, a quarterly experts‚Äô series, the Performance and Practices Institute, the Certified Performance Technology Workshop and topics presented at local chapter meetings throughout the year. Publications ISPI publishes information relevant to human performance improvement in three publications. Each is described below. Performance Improvement Journal (PIJ) PIJ is geared toward practitioners of performance technology in the workplace. Learn from hands-on experiences with models, interventions, \\"how- to\\" guides, and ready-to-use job aids, as well as research articles. Performance Improvement also offers updates on trends, reviews, and field viewpoints. The journal deals with all types of interventions and all phases of the HPT process. The common theme is performance improvement practice or technique that is supported by research or germane theory. PIJ is published 6 times each year. Performance Improvement Quarterly (PIQ) PIQ is a peer- reviewed journal created to stimulate professional discussion in the field and to advance the discipline of HPT through publishing scholarly works. Its emphasis is on human performance technologies such as front-end analysis or evaluation. It also offers literature reviews and experimental studies with a scholarly base, and some case studies. PIQ is published four times each year.() PerformanceXpress (PX) PX contains feature articles highlighting current developments and ideas in performance improvement, as well as regular columns written by dedicated professionals spotting trends, presenting Human Performance Technology (HPT) case studies, and delving into behavioral science.

Croce, op. cit., pp. 50-51 He was summoned to Florence by Lorenzo de' Medici, to whom he had dedicated a poem in 1472 on the sack of Volterra. The relations between him and the Medici court was encouraged by Cantalicio's friend, the humanist Agnolo Poliziano.A. Perosa, op. cit., pp. 24-25. Cantalicio later he taught at Rieti, Foligno, Spoleto, Perugia and Viterbo, where he continued to write. From this period date his and Epigrammata (in 12 books) published in 1493. Most of his poems are dedicated to the classical Latin authors, among whom Juvenal, Martial, Ovid, Horace and Terence. Others are dedicated to the lords of the courts where he stayed, including Giulio Cesare Varano and Federico da Montefeltro, to whom he dedicated the . In 1494 he was in Naples, in the retinue of Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, for the investiture of Alfonso II of Naples. His enthusiasm for the dynasty of Aragon made him sing the praises of the Duchess Isabella as well as Bartolomeo d'Alviano, to whom he dedicated a poem to the defense of Bracciano of 1497. Later, he dedicated to Lucrezia Borgia, Lucretiana the Spectacula, a detailed account of the celebrations held in Rome for her marriage to Alfonso I d'Este: it was, according to Benedetto Croce, best published description of that event.B. Croce, op. cit., p. 60.

Despite belonging to the House de la Cerda and aspiring to the Castilian- Leonese throne during the reigns of Sancho IV of Castile, Ferdinand IV of Castile and Alfonso XI of Castile, he carried the family name of his mother which corresponded to the name of his lordship. He was Lord of Biscay by his marriage to Maria Diaz de Haro II, daughter of Don Juan de Haro the Eye.The Old Law of Bizkaia (1452): introductory study and critical edition, Editors Gregorio Monreal Zia, William A. Douglass and Linda White, (University of Nevada Press, 2005), 35. He was also Lord of Villafranca, Oropesa, Torrelobat√≥n, Lerma, Paredes de Nava, Castroverde and Aguilar. Ensign of the King and Lord Steward of Alfonso XI of Castile. He was a great-grandson of Alfonso X the Wise, King of Castile and Le√≥n, and Louis IX, King of France. Family Origins Son of Ferdinand de la Cerda (1275‚Äì1322) and Juana N√∫√±ez de Lara the Little Dove. As such, he embodied the claim of his paternal grandfather, the Infante Ferdinand de la Cerda eldest son of King Alfonso X the Wise, while being heir to both the Lara holdings of his namesake maternal grandfather, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara \\"the Fat\\", and to the lordship of Viscaya coming from his maternal grandmother Teresa D√≠az of Haro. Inheritance On the death of his uncle, Juan Nunez de Lara the Younger in 1315, he became lord of the House of Lara, although his uncle, the late Lord of Lara, had arranged in his will that all his possessions were sold and the proceeds from its sale should go to prayers for the repose of his soul. However, the noblemen of Castile unwilling to remain without a Lord asked the king to appoint Juan Nunez de Lara, despite his young age, master of the House of Lara. The King concurred and the noblemen gathered a sum of money that included land, castles and villas for the lordship of Lara. In 1326, his signature appears on some border privileges. A year after the death of Juan de Haro, Juan Nunez de Lara was named Ensign of the King, and as such appears confirmed in his privileges from that year, ranking first among the nobility. In 1329, Don Juan Manuel, was at odds with Alfonso XI of Castile, because the king had imprisoned his wife, who was daughter of Don Juan Manuel. Therefore, Don Juan Manuel, suggested that the Lord of Lara be married to Maria Diaz de Haro II. After approval of the marriage by Maria's mother, Don Juan Manuel promised to make war on Alfonso XI, until Maria's father's, Juan de Haro, possessions were returned, along with lordship of Vizcaya. Concluding the agreement, Juan Nunez de Lara and Don Juan Manuel went to the city of Bayonne, where Maria Diaz de Haro had been taken after the assassination of her father, fearing reprisals from Alfonso XI the Just. In 1331, in the city of Bayonne, Juan Nunez de Lara married Maria Diaz de Haro II. Shortly thereafter, Don Juan Manuel arranged the marriage of his daughter Constance to Prince Pedro of Portugal, son of Alfonso IV of Portugal. With this, Don Juan Manuel got the support of the Portuguese ruler who had been allied with Alfonso XI, soon to be joined by the King of Granada. The agreements concluded between the Sultan of Granada and Don Juan Manuel, recording in the mutual aid pact that Juan Manuel was supported by Juan Nunez de Lara, with the aim of having Alfonso XI return his wife's possessions that had been confiscated. Revolts against Alfonso XI Arms of Juana N√∫√±ez of the House of Lara, mother of Juan N√∫√±ez III. In 1332, when Alfonso XI was crowned and instituted the Knights of the Band in the kingdom of Castile and Le√≥n, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara and Don Juan Manuel, showing their disagreement with the king, were not present at the ceremonies. At that time, both Don Juan Manuel and Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, fortified their positions and tried to alienate the king's servants and members of his house, such as Juan Martinez de Leyva, who left his post as Chamberlain in court and moved to the post of chief steward of Juan Nunez de Lara, despite the entreaties of Alfonso XI. Shortly thereafter, Don Juan Manuel and Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara began to make war on Alfonso XI, Don Juan Manuel from his Castle of Pe√±afiel and Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara from the city of Lerma. The king, who was in the city of Burgos, moved to the city of Valladolid. A short time later, Alfonso XI seized the castle of Avia, which had been occupied by supporters of the rebel barons. In 1333, the Muslims besieged the city of Gibraltar. Alfonso IX, who at that time was fighting against the two rebel nobles, sent the masters of the Military Orders to relieve Gibraltar, while he remained in Castile parleying with Don Juan Manuel and Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara to achieve peace. Soon after, the king sought the help of Manuel and de Lara to rescue the city of Gibraltar. Don Juan Manuel informed the king, that if he wanted his help he should give him the title of Duke, allow him to decide who inherited his possessions after his death and to be allowed to coin money in his own domain. For his part, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara asked the king for the Lordship of Biscay to be returned to his wife and all the villas, estates and castles which had belonged to her father, Juan de Haro. Alfonso XI delayed the granting of a response to such demands, and shortly thereafter went to meet with Don Juan Manuel in Pe√±afiel. Despite the initial goodwill, a final agreement was not reached between the rebel noble and his sovereign. Meanwhile, troops of Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara devastated Tierra de Campos, the king was informed of the seriousness of the situation in the besieged Gibraltar crossing, so Alfonso XI, insisted that Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara and Don Juan Manuel accompany him. Meanwhile, the city of Gibraltar capitulated to the Muslims and Alfonso XI began to besiege it, but had to raise the siege before the arrival of troops from Granada and Algeciras. Shortly thereafter, Juan Alfonso de Haro, who was at odds with the king, sided with Don Juan Manuel and Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara in their common struggle against Alfonso XI. During Lent of 1334, a squire of Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara gave Alfonso XI a letter, in which he informed the king that he was ending his vassal relationship with him. Enraged the king ordered the feet and hands the message bearer cut off, who was later beheaded. The king then considered attacking Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, who was besieging the town of Cuenca de Campos. The king, after seizing the towns of Melgar and Morales, addressed Valladolid in order to recruit more troops. Soon after, they laid a series of ambushes against Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, who managed to escape. Alfonso XI then decided to seize the strongholds of Vizcaya that were still loyal to Maria Diaz de Haro II, wife of Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara. Then the king besieged the fortresses of Villafranca Montes de Oca and Bustos and seized Pe√±aventosa, and ordered its demolition. Alfonso XI, after leaving some of his troops besieging the Pe√±a de San Juan, he returned to Castile, where in the town of Agoncillo, ordered the execution of Juan Alfonso de Haro, for abuses committed by him in the kingdom, for his support of rebel barons, and for having appropriated funds belonging to the Crown. After the execution, Alfonso XI besieged the town of Henry, where Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara was located, while the sovereign ordered Rodrigo Alvarez of Asturias to the town of Torrelobat√≥n, where Juana N√∫√±ez de Lara was located. Finding himself surrounded and unable to get help from his ally, Don Juan Manuel, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara decided to make peace with the king. In order to terminate disputes, Alfonxo XI confirmed the lordship of Biscay on Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara. Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara agreed, in the future, to recognize Alfonso XI as his king and give him all that he required. Shortly thereafter, Don Juan Manuel made peace with Alfonso XI. Alfonso XI besieges Juan N√∫√±ez In June 1336, Alfonso XI besieged the town of Lerma, where Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara was located. Meanwhile other armies were besieging Torrelobat√≥n, Busto and Villafranca. Alfonso XI also sent the Order of Santiago and the Order of Calatrava to besiege Castle Garcimu√±oz, where Don Juan Manuel was located. The village of Torrelobat√≥n soon capitulated to the king's troops, with Alfonso XI imposing the condition that they never return to power of Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara. Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, finding himself surrounded and without possibility of receiving relief, agreed to negotiate peace with Alfonso XI. It was then agreed that Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara and his supporters would retain all their possessions, that the fortifications of Lerma, Busto, Villafranca would be demolished, and that de Lara could not fortify any cities without the consent of the king. Also to prevent further transgressions of Juan N√∫√±ez, he would give Alfonso XI hostages. Agreeing to terms between them, Alfonso XI appointed Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, Ensign of the King and returned part of the Crown lands that had been theirs, giving also the towns of Cigales, Villal√≥n de Campos and Morales. In 1339, the ambassadors of King Peter IV of Aragon reported to Alfonso XI that they were willing to help in the fight against Muslims in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. That same year, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara was knighted by Alfonso XI in Seville. In 1339, Alfonso XI invaded the counties of Antequera and Ronda, held by the Muslims, joined by Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, and Alfonso Mel√©ndez de Guzman. King Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman of Morocco. invaded Spain in 1340, and after a naval battle, defeated the army of Alfonso XI and surrounded the city of Tarifa. Alfonso XI, requested help from the kings of Aragon and Portugal, meeting Alfonso IV of Portugal at city of Seville. In the Battle of R√≠o Salado, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara distinguished himself in battle, fought alongside Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, the Master of the Order of Santiago and other nobles at the forefront. He took part in the success garnered by the Christian armies at that time. In 1341 Alfonso XI conquered the town of Alcal√° la Real, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara was present lieutenant of the king. Siege of Algeciras During the Siege of Algeciras (1342‚Äì44), Alfonso XI surrounded the city of Algeciras, which was in the hands of Muslims. Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, Juan Manuel, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro, Juan Alfonso de la Cerda, lord of Gibrale√≥n, knights of France, England and Germany, and even King Philip III of Navarre, king consort of Navarra, who came accompanied by 100 horsemen and 300 infantry all participated in the siege. In June 1342, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria died of an epidemic. Alfonso XI divided Pedro's office between Don Juan Manuel, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, and Fernando Ruiz de Castro, all possessions that had belonged to his late father. In March 1344, after almost two years of siege, the city of Algeciras surrendered. In 1349, after spending several years in retirement, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara was summoned by Alfonso XI, together with the other nobles, so they could assist in the siege of Gibraltar. Alfonso XI went to Andalusia and laid siege to Gibraltar until 1350. The Castilian nobles, including Juan Nunez de Lara, petitioned Alfonso XI to lift the siege, because he risked losing his life if he persisted in the company. Despite the entreaties of Juan N√∫√±ez, Fernando Manuel, Lord of Villena and son of the late Don Juan Manuel, and Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, Alfonso XI persisted in his attempt to take Gibraltar, until he died in March 1350. After the death of Alfonso XI, his eldest son Pedro was proclaimed king. Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara, Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias and the other nobles lifted the siege of Gibraltar and led the body of Alfonso XI to the town of Seville, where he was buried in the Chapel Royal. On completion of the actual funeral of Alfonso XI, King Pedro I of Castile confirmed Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara in the office of lieutenant of the King and Lord Steward. On 28 November 1350, Juan N√∫√±ez de Lara died, suddenly and mysteriously, in the city of Burgos. Supporters of Juan Nunez suspected poison.Estow, Clara, Pedro the Cruel of Castile, 1350-1369 , (E.

Its goals were advancing field exploration and research in South and Central America on subjects such as biology, geography, anthropology, and archaeology, and promoting field sports such as mountaineering, rafting, and caving. The organization published the quarterly South American Explorer magazine, and sells maps, guidebooks, trip reports, and other materials.David Gonzales, \\"South American Explorers Club a Wealth of Information,\\" Chicago Tribune, March 14, 1999 There are clubhouses for member use: Lima and Cuzco in Peru; Quito, Ecuador; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Origins  South American Explorers was founded by journalist Donald James Montague as the South American Explorers Club in 1977. Before founding the organization, Montague did a stint in South Korea with the Peace Corps in the 1960s, then joined United Press International Television News (UPITN) as a New York City-based assignments editor.Interview with Donald James Montague, May 11, 2012 Linda Rosa claims to be co-founder and to have largely funded the initial enterprise. Tired of his desk job, Montague decided to organize a camera crew in South America because it was the source of the agency's \\"worst film,\\" and he figured it would be easy to do better.Tim Cahill, \\"The Adventurer's Continent: The Rags-to-Rags Story of the South American Explorers Club,\\" Outside magazine, April 1983 The crew would consist of himself and two friends he'd met in South Korea, Jane Berger and Dale Forster. The crew landed in Lima in 1971, not long after the 1970 Ancash earthquake. Earthquake.USGS.gov After filming a wide range of stories in Peru for UPITN and other organizations, they began covering events throughout South America, including Juan Per√≥n's 1973 return to Argentina after 18 years of exile in Spain. Soon after, the camera crew shifted its base of operations to Buenos Aires, but when Peron died in 1974, the state-sponsored Dirty War made conditions particularly unsafe for journalists. Montague chose to disband the camera crew later that year and headed overland to Peru. In Lima, Montague met with the Don Griffis, the business manager of the weekly Peruvian Times (then called the Lima Times because of conflicts with the military regime of Gen. Juan Velasco Alvarado). Peruviantimes.com Montague proposed starting an \\"explorers club\\" and magazine, where the members would be the source of articles. Griffis wasn't convinced but offered Montague six months of \\"subsistence allowance\\" to see if the idea would take off. Back in the U.S. Montague and Rosa visited the New York Explorers Club, which was supportive of his venture but declined to offer reciprocal membership because the South American Explorers Club would accept women, while the New York Explorers Club did not at the time. Explorers.org In Washington, D.C., Montague enlisted the help of Linda Rosa, whom he had met in Guayaquil during a camera expedition with UPITN. Lima, Peru In the summer of 1977 Montague and Rosa were back in Lima, and found offices at 146 avenue Portugal in the city's Bre√±a neighborhood for the newly christened \\"South American Explorers Club\\" (SAEC). With the assistance of Teddy Ronalds, founder of the Las Dunas hotel in Ica, the SAE attracted a group of supporters that included businessman and collector Miguel Mujica Gallo, Museorperu.com explorer John Hemming, horse breeder Fernando Gra√±a, Peruvian Horse Review, Vol. 3., No. 4, Winter 1976 surfing pioneer Carlos Dogny, Transworld Business, February 17, 2012 and Felipe Benavides, 1974 winner of the J. Paul Getty Award for Conservation Leadership. All became honorary founders of the SAEC. The Club's advisory board included Washington Post foreign correspondent Joanne Omang, Tulane University UPI journalist Daniel Doherty, and archaeologist Maria Reiche. During the summer of 1977 the \\"South American Explorers Club\\" was formally established; memberships were pegged at $25, while subscriptions to its planned magazine would be $10. For the first issue Montague wanted to start off with \\"something big.\\" After attending a gathering of Lima-based explorers, he spotted a curious detail on a NASA satellite photo released in 1976. This feature became the center of \\"The Dots of Pantiacolla,\\" written under the pseudonym Ursula Thierman. South American Explorer, No. 1, October 1977 > \\"Located somewhat right of center, near the base of the central mountain > range shown in this photo, is an amphitheater-shaped outcropping. The area > circumscribed by this elliptical formation encompasses some three square > kilometers. Within this oval are ten unexplained dots.... Exactly what they > are is not known.\\" The article would launch several expeditions to the area. Present for the magazine's birth was author and adventurer Tim Cahill, who \\"assisted in putting out the first issue of the magazine by sitting around uselessly drinking innumerable bottles of Crystal beer.\\" There was no advertising to speak of other than a few classifieds, which cost 2 cents a word, 50 words maximum. The completed magazine was set on the Linotype machines of the Lima Times and printed on their presses. The run was approximately 1,200 copies. At the end of a six-month trial period the club had attracted only 87 members. Two $500 life memberships would sign up over the coming years: Max Eiselin, a Swiss sporting-goods magnate and leader of the 1960 expedition that first ascended Dhaulagiri, seventh highest mountain in the world, Swissinfo.ch, retrieved May 11, 2012 and later HRH Colonel Prince Chalermpol of Thailand, an orchid collector, when Rosa returned to Lima in the early 1980s to manage the clubhouse in the absence of Tom Jackson. The magazine published two more issues in Lima before funding ended, and Montague and Rosa transferred the organization's headquarters to the United States, to decrease postage costs and because free lodging in Denver, Colorado had been offered by Steve Morrow, UPI's Lima bureau chief. Denver, Colorado Montague and Rosa arrived in Denver in late 1978 and soon found suitable offices at 2239 East Colfax Avenue, at the intersection of York Street. The building, offered a low-rent refuge to a number of progressive organizations, including Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, the Colorado Open Space Council, and the \\"Institute for Radical Studies,\\" all in warren-like spaces over the \\"New Yorker\\" bar. A 1979 article in the Rocky Mountain News, \\"Explorer Club Cuts Red Tape by Getting Out of Peru,\\" describes it as \\"a cramped office with scrounged equipment.\\"\\"Explorer Club Cuts Red Tape by Getting Out of Peru,\\" Rocky Mountain News, October 4, 1979, page 88 With Denver now the Club's headquarters, the Lima clubhouse became a resource for members during their travels. They could leave get advice, leave bags, and read or write trip reports. While the Lima Times no longer supported the SAEC financially, they donated a small reference library to the clubhouse and Don Griffis's daughter Ellie provided occasional assistance. Peruvian Times Club membership stood at 140. The fourth issue of the South American Explorer, April 1979, was the first published in the United States. Articles included \\"Jungle Pharmacy,\\" by Nicole Maxwell, author of the 1961 book Witch Doctor's Apprentice. New York Times, retrieved May 11, 2012 Don Montague contributed an article under the pseudonym Ursula Thiermann\\" wherein he proposed a solution to the mysterious Dots of Pantiacolla.

The Denver Post published an extensive article, \\"Magazine Introduces Continent to Readers.\\"\\"Magazine Introduces Continent to Readers,\\" Denver Post, December 14, 1981, page 88 Tim Cahill, present at the club's dawn in Lima, wrote \\"The Adventurer's Continent: The Rags-to-Rags Story of the South American Explorers Club\\" for Outside magazine. As the organization became better known, its stable of writers increased. In issue 8, Australian cartographer Kevin Healey, ITMB.ca wrote about mapping South America in \\"Carte Blanche.\\"\\"Carte Blanche,\\" South American Explorer, No. 8, August 1981, page 16 Anne Meadows, later the author of Digging Up Butch and Sundance,, Anne Meadows wrote \\"Better Pink than Extinct,\\" about South American flamingos.\\"Better Pink than Extinct,\\" South American Explorer, No. 8, August 1981, page 19 And Honorary founder John Hemming, at the time director and secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, contributed \\"The Draining of Lake Guatavita,\\"\\"The Draining of Lake Guatavita,\\" South American Explorer, No. 8, Page 25 which was drawn from his book The Search for El Dorado. In 1985 the organization moved to larger offices in what was then known as the John Hand Building, at 1510 York Street. Colorado Free University By this time Ethel Green of the Lima Clubhouse moved to Denver to become the manager there, while Betsy Wagenhauser, Rob Rachowiecki, Mark Thurber, Betsy Wagenhauser took over in Lima. During this time the organization and its magazine began to attract a wider range of writers, many early in their careers. These included Daniel Alarc√≥n, who penned a corrosive article on Lima; Johan Reinhard, discoverer of the Mummy Juanita and winner of the Rolex Award; Easter Island expert Georgia Lee, D. Bruce Means, now president of the Coastal Plains Institute; Kim MacQuarrie, documentary filmmaker and author of Last Days of the Incas; and National Geographic photojournalist Loren McIntyre. Also found in the table of contents were Robert L. Carneiro, Nicolas Jaeger, Vince Lee, Kenneth R. Wright, Hugh Thompson, Mark Plotkin, Stewart D. Redwood, Hilary Bradt, and Paolo Greer. During the time that the Shining Path was active in Peru, the SAEC served as a source of information about the safety of areas of the country.Carl Somers, \\"Q and A,\\" New York Times, January 28, 1990 In 1989 they expanded outside Peru for the first time, opening a clubhouse in Quito, Ecuador.Harvey Hagman, \\"Explorers Club to Open Office in Ecuador,\\" Washington Times, May 26, 1989 Ithaca, New York In February 1992, the club moved its U.S. headquarters from Denver to Ithaca, New York. Montague cited numerous reasons for the shift, including his having been born in Duchess County, New York and the presence of a strong Latin American studies department at Cornell University, but a potentially decisive factor was that he \\"just didn't want to die in Denver.\\" Montague left Denver over the strong objections of Rosa who just had a baby daughter Emily Rosa and could not easily leave her nursing job, telling her the move was to accommodate the wishes of his wife whose parents lived in Ithaca. Rosa thought it unwise to move to New York where the New York Explorers Club could finally sue the SAEC over its use of the term \\"Explorers Club,\\" as they had once threatened in the past. After Shining Path leader Abimael Guzm√°n was captured by Peruvian police in 1992, the country became safer to travel in. The club member and later novelist Kate Wheeler wrote a New York Times article about travel in Peru in 1994, something that would have been strongly discouraged not so long before.Kate Wheeler, \\"Back of Beyond in Peru,\\" New York Times, November 13, 1994 The South American Explorers Club has always urged responsible travel, and when ecotourism began to take off in the 1990s, it was a frequent source of information.Betsey Wade, \\"Practical Traveler: Learning How to Tread Lightly,\\" New York Times, June 15, 1997 In 1999 the organization opened a second office in Peru, in Cuzco funded with special donations from SAEC members.Debra Behr, \\"Adventurers and Scientists Seek Out Explorers Club,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 21, 1991 On February 8, 1999, the South American Explorers Club was sued by the New York Explorers Club in the Northern District court of New York. The accusation was \\"infringement by South American Explorers Club of various marks owned by the Explorers Club,\\" although 20 years earlier the Club had formed with the express consent of the Explorers Club. The lawsuit was prompted by sponsorship deals the Explorers Club was seeking to establish with American Express and other firms.Joseph Hooper, \\"Waiter, Is that Yak Wellington on My Plate?\\" American Express Departures, July/August 2008 Outsideonline.com, retrieved June 14, 2012 On September 30, 1999, the South American Explorers Club signed an agreement with the New York Explorers Club and became South American Explorers.\\"Settlement Agreement and General Release\\" between the Explorers Club and South American Explorers Club, June 30, 1999 While the organization is no called longer a \\"club,\\" it still has \\"clubhouses\\" in South America. It was on this basis that it opened the Buenos Aires clubhouse in 2006. The first office on the east coast of South America, far from the organization's roots in Peru. Founded in 1977, when hot type was the state of the art, The group now maintains a website, publishes an online magazine, and continues its mission of advancing exploration and research as well as field sports in South and Central America. The organization has no connection to the travel company called \\"South America Explorers\\" based in Florida. Clubhouses in South America All three SAE offices are now closed. The Quito office appears to have closed sometime around 2014, following some administrative issues. The Lima and Cusco offices closed for \\"some re-engineering\\" in 2017, with the indication that they might reopen in future. The \\"virtual\\" clubhouse in Buenos Aires may still be functioning. The now closed Lima clubhouse, the first in South America, was located at Calle Piura 135, Miraflores. The likewise closed Quito clubhouse, founded in 1989, was located in the La Mariscal neighborhood of Quito, at Jorge Washington E8-64 y Leonidas Plaza. The Buenos Aires clubhouse, founded in 2006, offers support services through Skype and email by staff based in the city.  South American Explorer magazine  The SAE's magazine was produced quarterly, but given the club's shoestring budget and somewhat peripatetic nature, this was always goal rather than a promise. The key was that a membership lasted until four issues were received; until the fourth arrived, membership continued unabated, so in a certain sense it was advantages for members not to receive a magazine. The first magazine was published in 1977 and No. 95 in 2010, an average of just under three magazines per year. Membership is now done on a yearly basis and isn't keyed to magazine production. Content is typically six to eight articles, book reviews, letters from members sometimes accompanied by dismissive responses, and a number of columns. These have included: Club News and Ace of Clubs: Don Montague's tongue-in-cheek columns are written to the members of South American Explorers. The text alternates between boasts of the club's achievements, elaborate excuses for its supposed shortcomings, and contemptuous dismissals of members' complaints. When the organization opened multiple clubhouses in South America, the \\"Club News\\" column became a compendium for updates from all the clubhouses. Montague's column became \\"Ace of Clubs,\\" even as the content and scathing erudition typically found there continued unabated. No Bull: Written by William Hornyak Marylhurst University under the nickname \\"Big Bill,\\" this column described the author's fictional exploits and offered spoofy advice to would-be explorers. The second \\"No Bull\\" column was titled \\"Live to Tell the Tell the Tale\\": > \\"O.K., let's face it ‚Äî killing is a damned dirty business. I don't care if > you're scattergunning snowgeese, pestering ptarmigan or Bowie-knifing your > way out of an anaconda straightjacket. It's all the same to me. Some people > may call it sport, but sending triple-mushrooming .280-grain lead calling > cards through every mildly misbehaving beast is a pretty disgusting pastime > in my opinion. No wild creature I know of every looked better for a hollow- > point bullet having passed through it at 3,200 feet per second, and I doubt > one ever will.\\" South American Explorer, December 1979 After lengthy discussions of how to dispatch wildlife large and small, Hornyak concludes with a warning from the \\"Jacques Cousteau Special Turtle Division\\" about the dangers of sleeping on a Galapagos beach in a plump sleeping bag, something that could \\"arouse potential assailants.\\" Part of the humor of \\"No Bull\\" was that each column was \\"part one,\\" yet part two would never come. Instead, there would be a fresh series of outrages by the blithely destructive \\"Big Bill\\" in South America. An exception to this pattern was a faux telegraph that appeared in issue six, in which Hornyak asked the South American Explorers Club for support in a supposed plan to excavate Machu Picchu with copious amounts of high explosives.\\"No Bull,\\" South American Explorer, No. 6 No Comment: Started early in the magazine's history, the column served as a place for credulous wire stories about subjects such as the work of Erich von D√§niken, a supposed \\"mystic civilization\\" near Punta Arenas, and monkey-shaped rock in a remote region of Peru that could represent work by a mysterious simian tribe. Unfortunately, the short articles tended to attract credulous awe rather than the intended derision. \\"No Comment\\" was terminated rather than allowing undeserving stories to gain wider traction.

On July 12, 2007, Rajan Zed, a Hindu cleric and a noted leader in Interfaith Relations from the Indian Association of Northern Nevada based in Reno, appeared at the United States Senate as its guest Chaplain. Prelude to the protest Rajan Zed, an Indian immigrant and American citizen, had served as guest Chaplain for the Nevada State Senate and Assembly and delivered the first Hindu prayer there (on March 19 and May 7, 2007). The American Family Association called on its members to contact their senators to complain about a non-monotheistic prayer being offered in the Senate. Prayer and protest At the Senate chambers on July 12, 2007 Rajan Zed (wearing the traditional sandalpaste tilak on his forehead, a ruddraksh mala, and saffron colored clothing) approached the podium. He was prepared to give the first official Hindu prayer ever offered at the Senate as a guest chaplain upon the request of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. This would also open the day's proceedings (which were largely centered around the Iraq war). The prayer was interrupted by three Christian protesters who were arrested by the Capitol police and charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting Congress. State Legislatures Soon after the protest at the U.S. Senate Rajan Zed served as guest chaplain offering a Hindu prayer before the California State Senate. Zed delivered the prayer without incident on August 27, 2007 with the appreciation of State Senator Elaine Alquist and the official State Senate Chaplain, Reverend James Richardson, an Episcopal priest. There was no complaints over the prayer from California's Conservative Christian Community, and the Reverend Louis Sheldon, who founded the state's \\"Traditional Values Coalition\\" declared \\"I don't see any problem with it at all. I would have no problems with a Hindu praying, just as I wouldn't an evangelical Christian.\\" National groups continued in their opposition to Hindu Legislative prayers with Wildmon speaking for the AFA stating \\"We're not opposed to the ability of people to worship their own gods or god, but when it comes to our civil government...it's always been the recognition of the God of the Bible. Every religion is not equal. That's my belief. That's logic.\\" California's Chief Sergeant-at-Arms for the state Senate admitted that they had taken extra security precautions in case of protests against the Zed's prayer. Seeking to promote understanding of Hinduism and \\"emphasizes the multicultural and religious freedom aspect of this country\\" throughout the end of 2007 and into 2008 Zed made requests and was granted a guest chaplaincy to recite Hindu prayers at State Legislatures in New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Arizona. Calls for candidates to denounce As the 2008 Presidential election approached, American Hindu organizations urged presidential candidates to denounce the protestors. The executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, Ishani Chowdhury, stated \\"if you look at it as a reflection of a larger number of people...we need people to condemn what happened and highlight the need for dialogue\\". Zed's later legislative invocations and the 2015 Idaho prayer boycott Since the 2007 protest Rajan Zed offered Hindu opening prayers in various State Senates and State Assemblies/Houses-of-Representatives and at various County Commissions/Boards and City Councils across the United States. On June 19, 2014 he offered the opening prayer as a guest chaplain at the United States House of Representatives. These events occurred without any notable public controversy. In March 2015 Rajan Zed was the focus of another protest of legislators over his leading a legislative invocation at the Idaho State Senate. Senator Steve Vick, with reported support from his constituents, tried to prevent Zed from offering the prayer. Failing to prevent the prayer, Vick and two other Republican state senators refused to enter the chamber until Zed had finished. Vick held that having a Hindu invocation would \\"send a message we're not happy with the way America is\\" and held that people under Hinduism \\"have a caste system. They worship cows.\\" Joining in the boycott of the prayer was Senator Sheryl Nuxoll who stated \\"Hindu is a false faith with false gods. I think it's great that Hindu people can practice their religion, but since we're the Senate, we're setting an example of what we, Idaho, believe.\\" Senator Lori Den Hartog joined the boycott holding it would be disingenuous to her Christian faith to attend and \\"It was a personal decision, I didn't want to announce it prior to the event.\\" Zed's prayer as guest chaplain was in English and Sanskrit focusing on selflessness and peace.
