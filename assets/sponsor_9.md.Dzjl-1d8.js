History The German Patent Office (German: Kaiserliches Patentamt) started developing a classification system for its patent documents in 1877.Introduction to the German Patent Classification (DPK) at the Swedish Patent and Trademark Office (PRV) It was greatly expanded during the following decades and was published in seven editions between 1906 and 1958, first as \\"Verzeichnis der deutschen Patentklassen\\" and later as \\"Gruppeneinteilung der Patentklassen\\". The abbreviation DPK, for Deutsche Patentklassifikation, is used in some databases. The DPK was also used in Sweden, Norway, and other countries in Scandinavia and central and eastern Europe. In the 1970s, development and active use of the system publications was discontinued as most of these countries switched to the International Patent Classification (IPC). The classification is still used on old patent documents. Between the editions, modifications were published in the form of \\"√Ñnderungen\\" (German for \\"modifications\\") and \\"Erg√§nzungslieferungen\\" (German for \\"updates\\"). Between 1958 and 1975 around 40 percent of the original groups were replaced with groups from the emerging IPC.

George Grove, who rediscovered many of Schubert's symphonies, assigned the following numbering after his 1867 visit to Vienna: *No. 7: E major, D 729 (completely sketched but not entirely scored by Schubert, with multiple historic and modern completions) *No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished *No. 9: C major, D 944 Great C major Breitkopf & H√§rtel, when preparing the 1897 complete works publication, originally planned to publish only complete works (which would have given the Great C major No. 7), with \\"fragments\\", including the Unfinished and the D 729 sketch, receiving no number at all. When Johannes Brahms became general editor of that project, he assigned the following numbers:Lindmayr, p. 56 *no number: E major, D 729 *No. 7: C major, D 944 Great C major *No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished Some of the disagreement continued into the 20th century. George Grove in his 1908 Dictionary of Music and Musicians, assigned the Great C major as No. 10, and the Unfinished as No. 9. (It is unclear from his article which symphonies, fragmentary or otherwise, are Nos. 7 and 8.)Grove (1908), pp. 320‚Äì328 The 1978 revision to the Deutsch catalogue leaves the order as follows: *no number: E major, D 729 *No. 7: B minor, D 759 Unfinished *No. 8: C major, D 944 Great C major1978 Deutsch Catalogue As a consequence, generally available scores for the later symphonies may be published using conflicting numbers.See references below for citations containing different numbers for the Unfinished Symphony. Grove and Sullivan also suggested that there may have been a \\"lost\\" symphony. Immediately before Schubert's death, his friend Eduard von Bauernfeld recorded the existence of an additional symphony, dated 1828 (although this does not necessarily indicate the year of composition) named the \\"Letzte\\" or \\"Last\\" symphony. Brian Newbould believes that the \\"Last\\" symphony refers to a sketch in D major (D 936A), identified by Ernst Hilmar in 1977, and which was realised by Newbould as the Tenth Symphony.Newbould (1999), p. 385 The fragment was bound with other symphony fragments (D 615 and D 708A). In conclusion, the resulting and most current order followed by the English- speaking world is: *No. 7: E major, D 729 *No. 8: B minor, D 759 Unfinished *No. 9: C major, D 944 Great C major *No. 10: D major, D 936A References Sources   Numbering of symphonies  The following citations illustrate the confusion around the numbering of Schubert's late symphonies.

Through the 19th century the company expanded, branching into several different products. In 1967, the Nokia corporation was formed. In the late 20th century, the company took advantage of the increasing popularity of computer and mobile phones. However, increased competition and other market forces caused changes in Nokia's business arrangements. In 2014, Nokia's mobile phone business was sold to Microsoft. 19th century The name \\"Nokia\\" is derived from the town Nokia and the Nokianvirta River. The commercial entities that preceded the modern day Nokia company included Nokia Ab (Nokia company); Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd); and Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy (Finnish Cable Works Ltd).Our Story Nokia Corporation 1 May 2014. In 1865, the mining engineer, Fredrik Idestam established a ground wood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland. Tampere was then part of the Russian Empire. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia. Nokia lies west of Tampere, by the Nokianvirta river. The river had better hydropower resources than those at Tampere. In 1871, Idestam and Leo Mechelin, a statesman and Idestam's friend, transformed Idestam's enterprises into a public limited company called Nokia Ab. In the late 1800s, Mechelin wanted to expand the company into the electricity business. However, Idestam refused. In 1896, Idestam retired and Mechelin become the company's chairman. He remained chairman from 1898 to 1914. During this time, Mechelin persuaded shareholders to allow the company to enter the electricity business. In 1902, Nokia commenced electricity generation. 20th century Portrait of Eduard Pol√≥n by Eero J√§rnefelt. Eduard Pol√≥n (1866 1960), was a Finnish business leader.Martin H√§iki√∂ Nokia Corporation 's official history Edita 2001, p.12 and 13. In 1898, Pol√≥n founded Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works) - a manufacturer of galoshes and other rubber products. In the early 1900s, the Finnish Rubber Works established factories near Nokia and used the town's name in the company's branding. After World War I, the Nokia Company was nearing bankruptcy and was acquired by the Finnish Rubber Works. In 1932, the Finnish Rubber Works also acquired the Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy (Finnish Cable Works). The cable works had been founded in 1912 by Arvid Wickstr√∂m. His company produced telephone, telegraph, and electrical cables. In 1963, after 16 years as a technical director, Verner Weckman became the president of the Finnish Cable Works company. Weckman was a wrestler and was Finland's first Olympic Gold medallist. After World War II, Finnish Cable Works supplied cables to the Soviet Union as part of its war reparations. This gave the company a foothold for later trade. Nokia corporation A capacitor made by Nokia Capacitors In 1967, Nokia Corporation was formed through the merger of the three companies. The new company manufactured products including paper items, car and bicycle tires, rubber boots, communications cables, televisions and other consumer electronics, personal computers, generators, robotics, capacitors, Military technology and equipment (such as the SANLA M/90 device and the M61 gas mask for the Finnish Army), plastics, aluminum and chemicals. In 1960, a cable division of the Nokia group had been formed. In 1962, it produced a pulse height analyzer used in nuclear power plants. In 1967, an electronics division within the Nokia corporation was formed. It operated for the next fifteen years, sometimes at a loss. Nokia researchers were encouraged to develop their own projects. This may have contributed to Nokia's focus on mobile phone technologies. Network equipment In the 1970s, Nokia produced the Nokia DX 200, a digital switch for telephone exchanges. The DX 200 became the workhorse of the network equipment division. Its architecture allowed it to be further developed into other switching products. For example, in 1984, the development of an exchange for the Nordic Mobile Telephony network was begun. The network equipment division was merged with a Finnish State entity to form \\"Telefenno\\". In 1987, the state sold its shares in Telefenno to Nokia and in 1992, the name was changed to Nokia Telecommunications. In 1998, the Israeli multinational company, Check Point which was founded in 1993, established a partnership with Nokia. Check Point's software was bundled with Nokia's network security tools. Mobile radio telephony Prior to cellular mobile telephony, there was mobile radio telephony. In the 1960s, Nokia had started producing commercial and military mobile radio telephones. From 1964, Nokia had developed VHF radios in collaboration with Salora Oy. From 1966, Nokia and Salora had developed ARPs (Autoradiopuhelin or radio car phones). In 1971, this technology became the first commercially available mobile phone network in Finland and in 1978, it offered 100 percent coverage in Finland. In the 1970s and 1980s, Nokia developed the Sanomalaitej√§rjestelm√§ (messaging system), a digital, portable and encrypted text-based communications device for the Finnish Defence Forces. Nokia mobile telephone (1G)  NMT-900 mobile phone from 1989 (left), compared to the Nokia 1100, a GSM phone from 2003. In 1979, Nokia and Salora established a joint venture, \\"Mobira Oy\\". Mobira developed mobile phones for the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) network, called the \\"1G\\" and was the first fully automatic cellular phone system. It became commercially available in 1981. In 1982, Mobira introduced its first car phone, the \\"Mobira Senator\\" for NMT 450 networks. In 1984, Nokia purchased Salora. Nokia's telecommunications division was renamed \\"Nokia-Mobira Oy\\". In the same year, the \\"Mobira Talkman\\", an early portable phone was launched. In 1987, Nokia introduced its first mobile phone, the \\"Mobira Cityman 900\\" for NMT 900 networks. In comparison to the NMT 450 network, there was a better signal strength but less coverage. While the Mobira Senator of 1982 had weighed and the Talkman just under , the Mobira Cityman weighed only including its battery. The phone, which was considered expensive, became an item indicating a high status. In 1987, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was seen using a Mobira Cityman in Helsinki. The phone developed the nickname, the \\"Gorba\\". In 1989, Nokia-Mobira Oy was renamed \\"Nokia Mobile Phones\\". Global system for mobile communications (2G) Nokia contributed to the development of the GSM 2G. It was able to carry data (computing) as well as voice traffic. Nordic Mobile Telephony (NMT) was an early provider of international roaming. In 1987, GSM 2G became the new European standard for digital mobile technology. In 1989, Nokia delivered its first GSM network to the Finnish operator Radiolinja. On 1 July 1991, in Helsinki, the first telephone call on the GSM G2 network was made by Harri Holkeri, the Prime Minister of Finland. He used a prototype Nokia GSM phone to make the call. In 1992, the first GSM phone, the Nokia 1011, was made commercially available. The model number, \\"1011\\" refers to its launch date on 10 November 1992. In 1994, a branding ringtone, the Nokia tune, was included with the Nokia 2100 series. The GSM 2G network and mobile phones provided improved voice calls, international roaming and support for new services such as text messaging (Short Message Service (SMS)). In 2008, the GSM 2G network had approximately 3 billion users. There were at least 700 mobile phone commercial providers in 218 nations or territories. There were 15 mobile phone connections per second and 1.3 million mobile phone connections per day. Personal computers The Nokia Booklet 3G mini laptop. In the 1980s, Nokia's computer division \\"Nokia Data\\" produced a series of personal computers called the \\"MikroMikko\\". It was aimed at the business market. MikroMikko 1, was released on 29 September 1981. Its competitor was the IBM personal computer. In 1991, Nokia Data was sold to a British company, International Computers Limited (ICL). Nokia produced Cathode ray tubes (CRT) and thin film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT LCDs) for personal computers and other applications. In 2000, Nokia sold its display products division to ViewSonic. However, in August 2009, Nokia released the Nokia Booklet 3G mini laptop which it continued for a short time. Other abandoned Nokia products include DSL modems and digital set-top boxes. Telecommunications In the 1980s under the chief executive officer (CEO) Kari Kairamo, Nokia expanded, mostly through acquisitions. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, Nokia corporation experienced financial difficulties. Losses were made in the television manufacturing division. In 1988, Nokian Tyres became a separate entity. Nokia's paper division was sold in 1989. In 1990, Nokian Footwear was a separate entity. During the rest of the 1990s, Nokia divested itself of all other businesses. In 1988, Kairamo committed suicide. Following his death, Simo Vuorilehto became Nokia's chairman and CEO. From 1990 to 1993, Finland was in recession. Vuorilehto made major changes to the Nokia corporation. The telecommunications division was stream-lined. The television and personal computing divisions were sold. In 1992, Jorma Ollila became CEO. He made telecommunications Nokia's sole concern. International sales increased relative to those in Finland. By the mid 1990s, Nokia's supply of mobile telephones could not meet demand. Changes to Nokia's supply chain were made. Between 1996 and 2001, Nokia's revenue increased from 6.5 billion euros to 31 billion euros and between 1998 and 2012, Nokia was the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer. Nokia's logistics and economies of scale advantaged the company. 21st century Reduction in size of Nokia mobile phones. Left to right: Nokia 638 (1996; 19.06 cm height), Nokia 2160 EFR (1996; 16.42 cm), Nokia 5160 (1998; 14.84 cm), Nokia 6070 (2006; 10.5 cm) In 2000, Nokia launched the Nokia 3310. In 2003, the Nokia 1100 handset was launched. Nokia combined a video game console and a mobile phone in the \\"N-Gage\\". In April 2008, Nokia Productions started a mobile movie-making project. The movie which was presented at the Nokia Theater Los Angeles on 14 October 2008 was directed by Spike Lee. It was approximately 15 minutes long and comprised short segments made on phones contributed by the public. The theme of the movie was \\"humanity\\".Holson L. Spike Lee and Nokia team up for film New York Times 24 April 2008.Premiere Getty Images 14 October 2008. In 2009, Nokia reentered the personal computing market. Its product, the Nokia Booklet 3G was a Windows-based netbook. The company also entered the smartphone market. The Series 40 was a phone platform used in feature phones, mainly running Java-based applications. Nokia acquired Smarterphone, a company making the Smarterphone OS for \\"low end\\" phones and merged it with Series 40 to form the Asha Platform, which also used some user interface characteristics from Nokia's MeeGo platform. The Asha 501 used this new operating system. The Series 40 was discontinued in late 2014. Symbian OS Until 2011, Symbian was Nokia's main smartphone operating system. The devices using the Symbian operating system included the Nokia 7650, Nokia N-Gage, Nokia N96, Nokia 6600, Nokia 7610, Nokia 6630, Nokia N90, Nokia N95, Nokia N82, Nokia E71, Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, Nokia N97, Nokia X6 and the Nokia N8. The 2012 Nokia 808 PureView had a 41-megapixel camera. It was the last phone using the Symbian platform. File:Nokia6600.pngNokia 6600 (2003) with a VGA camera, Bluetooth and expandable memory.

Linux devices Nokia's first Linux devices were the Nokia Internet tablets and the Nokia N900, which ran the Debian-based Maemo. The Maemo project merged with Intel's Moblin to create MeeGo. The Nokia N9 was released before MeeGo was abandoned in favour of Windows Phone. The final products using Linux were the Nokia X series which had an Android operating system. Reorganizations On 5 May 2000, Nokia opened a mobile phone factory in Kom√°rom, Hungary. In April 2003, difficulties in Nokia's division of network equipment led to restructuring and layoffs. Nokia's public image in Finland was diminished. litigation was brought against Nokia and a critical documentary television program was broadcast. In June 2006, CEO of Nokia Jorma Ollila, resigned and became the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was the new CEO. In March 2007, Nokia signed an agreement with Cluj County Council, Romania to open a plant near the city in Jucu commune. Moving the production from the Bochum, Germany factory to a low wage country created an uproar in Germany. In 2008, Nokia ceased its mobile phone distribution in Japan. In 2009, Check Point purchased Nokia's network security division. In February 2012, Nokia announced that 4,000 employees would be dismissed. This was to allow its manufacturing centres to move from Europe and Mexico to Asia. In March 2012, Nokia dismissed 1,000 employees at its Salo, Finland factory. In June 2012, research facilities in Ulm, Germany and Burnaby, Canada closed. By the end of 2013, 10,000 employees had been dismissed. In January 2013, Nokia dismissed 1,000 employees from its internet technology, production and logistics divisions. Acquisitions On 22 September 2003, Nokia acquired \\"Sega.com\\", a branch of Sega in order to develop the N-Gage device. On 10 February 2006, Nokia purchased the Intellisync Corporation, a provider of data and Personal information management (PIM) synchronization software. On 19 June 2006, Nokia and Siemens AG announced the merger of their mobile and fixed-line phone network equipment businesses with equal holdings. This created the entity \\"Nokia Siemens Networks\\" located in Espoo, Finland. Approximately 20,000 Nokia employees were employed by the new company. On 8 August 2006, Nokia purchased the online music distributor \\"Loudeye Corporation\\" for approximately US$60 million. In July 2007, Nokia purchased the media sharing service \\"Twango\\".

In 2012, Nokia purchased \\"Smarterphone\\", a feature phone operating system developer, and the imaging company Scalado. Loss of smartphone market share Apple's iPhone (2007) did not immediately outsell the Nokia smartphones such as the Nokia N95. At the end of the 2007 financial year, Symbian had 62.5 percent of the market share while Microsoft's Windows Mobile had 11.9 percent and BlackBerry (RIM) had 10.9 percent. However, at the end of the 2008 financial year, Nokia's market share had fallen to 40.8 percent. The Nokia N96, the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and the Nokia E71 did not compete against Apple's iPhone 3G. On 24 June 2008, Nokia bought the Symbian operating system and in 2009 made it open source. In early 2009, Nokia released several devices such as the Nokia N97, a touchscreen device with a landscape QWERTY slider keyboard that was focused on social networking which received mixed reviews and the Nokia E52 which received positive reviews. At the end of the 2008 financial year, Symbian's market share was 52.4 percent and at the same time in 2009, it was 46.1 percent with the loss going to Blackberry, iOS and Android. In 2010, the commercial pressure on Nokia increased. Original equipment manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics and Sony Ericsson chose to make Android based smartphones, not Symbian based smartphones. Nokia developed \\"Symbian^3\\" to replace the S60 platform but it never became popular. At the end of the 2010 financial year, Symbian's market share was 32 percent while Android's was 30 percent. Despite losing market share, Nokia's smartphones were profitable. Sales in 2010 steadily increased quarter by quarter. In the last quarter of 2010, Nokia sold 4 million N8 smartphones. In February 2010, Nokia and Intel announced \\"MeeGo\\". MeeGo was a merger of their Linux based Maemo and Moblin projects. The project aimed to create one mobile operating system suitable for many types of device including tablets and smartphones. Nokia planned to use MeeGo on its smartphones. This was only achieved on the Nokia N9 (2011). In February 2011, Elop wrote to his employees. He said Nokia was on a \\"burning platform\\". Elop said the \\"war of ecosystems\\" (software ecosystem) between iOS and Android was part of Nokia's commercial difficulties. Partnership with Microsoft Market share of Symbian, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7 among US smartphone owners from Q1 2011 to Q2 2012 according to Nielsen Company. In February 2011, Stephen Elop and Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer formed a business partnership. (Elop had worked at Microsoft.) Nokia adopted Windows Phone as the operating system on its smartphones and accessed the Bing search engine for its devices. The \\"Here\\" Nokia maps software was integrated into Microsoft's \\"Bing\\" mapping services. In June 2011, Apple was making more smartphones than Nokia and a successful partnership with Microsoft became imperative for Nokia's business. In September 2011, Nokia dismissed 3,500 employees and closed its factory in Cluj, Romania. On 26 October 2011, at the Nokia World conference, the first Nokia Windows Phone 7 based devices were launched. They were the Nokia Lumia 710 and the more expensive Nokia Lumia 800. After the launch, Nokia's share price fell approximately 14 percent and Nokia's smartphone sales rapidly decreased. Between 2011 until 2013, Nokia's sales of smartphones fell from first in the market to tenth. In the second quarter of the 2011 financial year, Nokia made a loss of 368 million Euros. On 26 January 2012, Nokia reported its sales of the Lumia smartphones was \\"well above one million\\", two million sales in the first quarter of the 2012 financial year and four million sales in the second quarter of the 2012 financial year. However, in the second quarter of the 2012 financial year, in North America, Nokia sold 600,000 Symbian and Windows phones combined. In the same period, 26 million iPhones and 105 million Android phones were sold. In August 2012, while announcing an alliance with Groupon, Elop identified Google as a competitor. On 8 February 2012, Nokia dismissed 4,000 employees from smartphone manufacturing plants in Europe. Smartphone assembly was moved closer to component suppliers in Asia. On 14 June 2012, Nokia a further 10,000 dismissals. Production and research sites in Finland, Germany and Canada were closed. On 18 June 2012, Moody's downgraded Nokia's bond rating to junk. On 4 May 2012, a group of Nokia investors filed a class action against the company as a result of disappointing sales. On 22 August 2012, there were calls for Elop's dismissal. In December 2012, Nokia sold its headquarters, Nokia House, for ‚Ç¨170 million and then leased the property. In the fourth quarter of the 2012 financial year, Nokia sold 6.6 million smartphones (2.2 million Symbian and 4.4 million Lumia devices). In May 2013, Nokia released the Asha platform on its inexpensive smartphone devices. The American media company Vox Media speculated Nokia was not fully committed to Windows. In the same month, Nokia entered a partnership with China Mobile, the Chinese mobile service provider to make the Lumia 920 (Lumia 920T) available in China. In the second quarter of the 2013 financial year, Nokia recorded an operating loss of ‚Ç¨115m. Nokia's revenue fell to ‚Ç¨5.7bn. In the same period, sales of the Lumia smartphone exceeded those of BlackBerry's handsets. Nokia's sales results were especially poor in China and the US. In the second quarter of the 2013 financial year, 7.4 million Lumia devices were sold. Sale of mobile phone business to Microsoft On 25 April 2014, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft for approximately ‚Ç¨3.79bn. ‚Ç¨1.65bn was paid by Microsoft for a ten- year license to Nokia's patents. Nokia's mobile phone assets became a part of Microsoft Mobile, based in Finland. The purchase was delayed from March 2014 to April 2014 while a taxation dispute in India was resolved. Microsoft acquired the Asha, X and Lumia brands, but had only a limited license to the Nokia brand. Microsoft could only use the Nokia brand to promote Asha, X and Lumia products until December 2015, and feature phones for 10 years. Microsoft did not acquire any rights to the Nokia tune but can use it as the default ringtone on Nokia branded devices. Nokia was prohibited from manufacturing any Nokia branded smartphones until December 2015. Microsoft also took over Nokia's website and social media outlets for a minimum of one year. Microsoft used Nokia branding until October 2014. Elop became the head of Microsoft's devices division. Risto Siilasmaa became acting CEO of Nokia until the appointment of Rajeev Suri. Nokia continued Nokia Networks, its infrastructure division and Nokia Technologies, its development and licensing division. In July 2014, Microsoft dismissed 12,500 former Nokia employees.Tu, Janet I., \\"Microsoft layoffs signal a changing culture: The cuts are partly related to Microsoft‚Äôs acquisition of Nokia‚Äôs phone business and partly a reflection of Nadella‚Äôs vision of a Microsoft that‚Äôs less management heavy and more agile\\", The Seattle Times, 17 July 2014 Microsoft also ended development of Nokia's non-Windows Phone product lines. Sale of licenses In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015. On 17 November 2014, Ramzi Haidamus, head of the Nokia technologies division said the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business by licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. On 18 November 2014, the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn was released. Alcatel-Lucent On 3 November 2016, Nokia purchased the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent for approximately ‚Ç¨15.6 billion. At completion, Nokia shareholders held 66.5% of the new company and Alcatel-Lucent shareholders held 33.5% of the new company. Alcatel-Lucent's Bell Labs and submarine cables division were maintained in the new company. The Alcatel-Lucent brand was no longer used.

The company has its headquarters, IG Watteeuw International nv, in Oostkamp (Belgium). Next to that it has locations in Brno (Czech Republic), Ia»ôi (Romania), Suzhou (China) and Zanesville, Ohio (USA). Globally, IGW employs over 1.000 people.  Activities  IGW delivers premium transmission solutions for niche applications in industries, all over the world. Products are usually individually tailored to meet the needs of customers. IGW focuses on three main markets: * Transport: design and manufacture and servicing of gears, gearboxes and couplings for trains, metros, trams, cable cars and marine. * Industry: delivering transmission solutions for a wide range of industries, such as the textile and printing industry, semiconductors, the medical and chemical sector. * Energy: supplying solutions for customers in the energy sector, for example oil and gas rigs, power plants, wind turbines and other applications.  History   Foundation  IGW's first Lorenz gear shaping machine, 1949 IGW was founded in 1949 by Alfons Watteeuw, who was only 19 years old at the time. His father Henri Watteeuw was the driving force behind the creation of the company. He was the first certified technical instructor in West-Flanders. As a teacher, guest lecturer at the engineering department of the KU Leuven and technical director of the high school VTI Bruges, he possessed the knowledge and the contacts to set up a successful industrial firm. The day after Alfons‚Äô graduation, they registered his one-man business ‚ÄúWatteeuw Alfons‚Äù at the Commercial Court. Address of establishment: the barn in their yard; Rapaertstraat 31, Assebroek (Bruges). Around that time German manufacturing plants were being dismantled, as a penalty for the country‚Äôs role in the Second World War. Father and son visited a few depots and eventually purchased a Lorenz gear shaping machine with a diameter capacity of one meter, from the BMW factory in M√ºnchen. That machine would be the first of many‚Ä¶  Continuous growth  Alfons Watteeuw landed his first large-scale order from a renowned firm in 1964. The Belgian company Arpic Engineering (that was later acquired by Atlas Copco), contacted Watteeuw with a substantial order that had to be delivered on a very short notice. Furthermore, Alfons always kept his eyes open for opportunities abroad. In 1976 Watteeuw got its first purchase from Atlas Copco in the United States. That signified an international breakthrough. Other international partnerships followed quickly, for example with CNH Industrial, the American producer of New Holland agricultural devices. Heat treatment at IGW After specializing in agricultural machines, the first investments in the aerospace industry followed. In the early eighties, Watteeuw became the supplier of the slat rack wing mechanism for Airbus. Father Henri Watteeuw died in 1986. In 1987 the company, by that time named ‚ÄúMC Watteeuw‚Äù (Mechanische Constructie Watteeuw / Mechanical Construction Watteeuw), moved to the Kampveldstraat 51 in Oostkamp, where the main offices and factory are still established. Soon after the move Watteeuw started to invest massively in heat treatment. Because of that the entire gear production became vertically integrated in the company. This helped Watteeuw to distinguish itself from smaller competitors.  Acquisition by BMT  To finance further growth, and seeing that his children weren‚Äôt planning to take over the company, Alfons Watteeuw started looking for an industrial partner in the early nineties. In 1992 Belgium‚Äôs longest listed holding BMT took over 60% of the shares in Watteeuw International. Over the years BMT‚Äôs participation grew to 100%. The group's investments played a significant role in the further expansion of Watteeuw. BMT (and with it Watteeuw) stayed listed until 2004.  Globalization  In the early nineties, Watteeuw started an international expansion. In 1997 the company opened its first foreign plant in the Czech Republic, following the so-called greenfield approach by constructing a new factory in Brno. Eventually Watteeuw moved the entire production line of New Holland agricultural gears to that site. In 1998 it was Romania‚Äôs turn. Watteeuw acquired the maintenance department of Terom, the country‚Äôs biggest synthetic fiber company at the time. Watteeuw locally produced gears for their machines and provided servicing jobs. When Terom shut down a few years later, Watteeuw bought a part of the remaining factory to offer its services to other customers in the region. Meanwhile, the firm kept expanding its share in the aerospace industry. In 2000 BMT took over the American company Caratron Industries, manufacturer of precision gears, axles and gearboxes for aeronautic and space devices. Caraton and Eurair, Watteeuw‚Äôs subsidiary that delivered to Airbus, were afterwards turned into a new division: BMT Aerospace. Other areas in which Watteeuw participates since the 2000s are the medical sector, marine industry and the energy sector, with among others the production of gears for wind turbines. During that same period Watteeuw started expanding its logistical network. To ameliorate its customer services, the company established local plants and warehouses in the East. Since 2001 Watteeuw has activities in China, initially through a joint-venture with Picanol in the regional branch of AmTech. Watteeuw took over Picanol‚Äôs shares in 2006. Up ‚Äòtill today the focus of the Chinese plant lays on railway applications for the Asian market. Watteeuw has been a player in the railway industry since the nineties. In 2013 Watteeuw landed in the United States. Due to the internationalization, a more global approach was needed so the name of the company changed from IG Watteeuw to IGW.

What little we know about Mast are the notes related by Karel van Mander in his Schilder-boeck, who mentioned him as part of a long list of pupils of Frans Floris. Mast was born in Brielle and was living in Delft when Van Mander was writing.Frans Francken in Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck, 1604 After Frans Floris died he went to live with Frans Francken the Elder, who he served (along with other ex-Floris pupils) by copying works for production. While copying a painting by Floris there, namely a \\"cross-carrier\\" (eenen Cruys-drager van Floris), there was a hand holding a whitish cross, and while Mast was painting, a daddy long legs sat on the original, which Mast painted onto his copy very cleverly, including all the shadows. When his master came into the room, he said he could see he wasn't a very quick painter, because the spiders had time to shit on his work. Making a movement to brush it away with his hat, and seeing it wasn't moving but was painted, he became embarrassed and said that he shouldn't take it off but let it remain. The next day Mast showed it to his colleague Gortzius Geldorp and told him about what his master said, boasting \\"Zeuxis's birds! I fooled the Master with this creature!\\". Geldorp wouldn't believe him until he was told later to go look at the painting. Van der Mast travelled to Paris where he lived for two years with the Archbishop of Bourges, for whom he painted a Saint Sebastian surrounded by all manner of herbs, that impressed the king's own personal physician. He then went to live with Monseur de la Queste, knight, president, en procureur-general of the King of France, for whom he worked for seven years. The last four years of which he was the personal assistant to his wife, who herself was a lady-in-waiting to the Queen. He was knighted by the King at the request of his mother at a masquerade ball held on Shrove Tuesday. Court life prevented him from painting. He is known for portraits and historical allegories, but only two portraits are known to be by him today. A painting in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen has long been attributed to him but this has been disputed.La messe de la Ligue , Plechtige mis in het bijzijn van Hendrik III in the RKD In his work on Van Mander, Hessel Miedema was able to discover that Mast paid an admission fee for the Delft Guild of St. Luke in the year 1589 for 1587, and was chairman there in 1593.Hessel Miedema, Lives of the Illustrious Netherlandish and German Painters, Volume IV, p. 47-48 The mentioned Monseur de la Queste must refer to Jean de la Guesle (d. 1588), who was appointed president of the parliament of Burgundy by Catherine de' Medici, who Mander refers to as \\"Queen\\". It is unclear who the Archbishop of Bourges was, but Jean de la Guesle had a son Francois who was archbishop of Tours. It is unknown why Mast returned to Delft, where he later died, but probably this was because both his patrons had died.Herman van der Mast in the RKD File:Herman van der Mast - Portrait of a man aged 33 in 1589.jpgPortrait of a man aged 33 in 1589 File:Herman van der Mast - Portrait of a woman aged 24 in 1587.jpgPortrait of a woman aged 24 in 1587 References 1550 births 1610 deaths People from Brielle Dutch Golden Age painters Dutch male painters Members of the Delft Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Herman van der Mast"},{"id":"47108057","text":"Robert Richter (born October 23, 1929) is an American film director and producer.

He was a large landowner in Chicot County, Arkansas and a Director of railroad companies. He was a prominent financier and developer of the \\"New South\\". Early life He was born on July 9, 1843 in Demopolis, Alabama.John N. Ingham, Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, Santa Barbara, California: Greenwood Publishing Group, Volume 1, 1983, pp. 124-125 His father, Andrew Pickens Calhoun, was a planter. He had a brother, Patrick Calhoun. His paternal grandfather, John C. Calhoun, served as the Vice President of the United States from 1825 to 1829. He was educated in Demopolis, Alabama. He graduated from South Carolina College in 1863. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he served in the Confederate States Army (CSA). Career In 1866, Calhoun entered in a partnership with James R. Powell, a businessman from Montgomery, Alabama, whereby he moved freedmen from the Southeast to Yazoo County, Mississippi, where they worked on new plantations. A year later, he decided to do this on his own, and on a larger scale. Over the years, he moved over 5,000 freedmen from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama to the Yazoo Valley of Mississippi. By 1869, Calhoun moved to the Florence Plantation in Chicot County, Arkansas, which was inherited by his wife through her mother. By 1881-1882, he acquired a few more plantations in Chicot County: Harwood, Hebron, Luna, Fawnwood, Patria, Hyner's, and Latrobe. He also acquired the Sunnyside Plantation from the Starling family for US$90,000. He also acquired the Lakeport Plantation from his mother-in-law. He established the Calhoun Land Company, the Florence Planting Company, and the Chicot Planting Company. He teamed up with investors J. Baxter Upham of Boston and Austin Corbin of New York City. However, due to heavy debt, by 1885, he let his brother divest of their Arkansas landholdings. Meanwhile, Calhoun moved to New York City, where he invested in the construction of Southern railways. He served as on the Board of Directors of railroad companies. He became the majority proprietor of the Baltimore Coal Mining and Railway Company. He sued the United States Shipbuilding Company.

In his debut match the name \\"Rogelio\\" appeared in the Celta lineup with Pasar√≠n, accompanying the latter in defence. In just his second game (13/12/1925) he formed part of the midfield with Welcome and Balbino; in every lineup his position was striker. And it would be as a striker he left his mark in Celta's history. According to statistics provided by Alberto Fernandez, Rogelio holds the record for the player with the most goals in a single game, scoring eight goals on January 17, 1926 in the 15-0 victory over Sporting Union. Posada and Pinilla both scored six goals in a single game, but only on one occasion. Rogelio Tapia played with Celta for seven seasons. During those seasons Celta scored amassed 582 goals (119 of which were made by Rogelio -more than 20% -), making him a club legend. This brave star striker wore the Galician soccer jersey, in one of the many matches he played before the Spanish Civil War. In particular, Rogelio starred in a friendly match, that the Galician team played in Riazor on July 28, 1929, against the Center of Spain team. That day he teamed up with Idiro; Manol√≠, Pasar√≠n, Hermida, Rivera, Basterrechea, Reigosa, Hilario, Polo, and P√©rez, being accompanied by several friends of his club, the Real Club Celta de Vigo. The match ended tied 0-0, and the great striker Rogelio could not drill the opposing goal. His best year was the 1926-27 campaign, in which he scored 36 goals in 23 matches. But his global numbers are the ones that are highlighted with golden letters in the pages of the club history. Rogelio Tapia scored 119 goals in 113 official matches with Celta, averaging 1.05 goals per match. Stratospheric numbers, making him the all-time best player in the club's history. Rogelio left Celta in 1932, but still played one season in Union Sporting C. de Lavadores. The record lives on in Celta's history soccer player with the best goalscoring average, scoring one goal every 85 minutes.

He was mayor of Ipswich. A number of the buildings he designed are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Early life Samuel Shenton was born at Leicester, England on 8 July 1829, the son of a building contractor of that town. At thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner, and subsequently acquired good practical experience in his trade at Liverpool. On the advice of his sister Elizabeth who had already immigrated to Australia, on 26 October 1850 he sailed on the Tartar from Plymouth arriving in Sydney on 8 February 1851. After a fortnight's stay in Sydney, he arrived in South Brisbane on 1 March 1851 and in Ipswich on the following day. He was accompanied by his mother and sister, and also by the Rev. Thomas Deacon and his niece, Eliza Thorpe. Shenton at once commenced business as a carpenter and contractor. In the early 1850s he also acted as an undertaker in Ipswich, organising burials. However, as he did not have a hearse, the coffins were carried to the cemetery in a firewood cart. His early works included: * Dr. Challinor's house and shop in Brisbane Street (subsequently destroyed by fire) * Mr. P. Cardew's residence at Rhossilli * the Ellenborough Street Wesleyan Church and parsonage * the Congregational Church in Brisbane-street * the Ipswich School of Arts * Mr. G. H. Wilson's residence * the Lands Office. He also fitted up the first church in which the Rev. Edward Griffith (father of the Queensland Premier Samuel Griffith) preached on his arrival in the Queensland colony and also the first Presbyterian Church for the late Rev. Dr. Nelson (father of the Queensland Colonial Treasurer). About 1879 ago he retired from the active work of contracting, and devoted his attention to the architectural part of the business, carrying on business as an architect for many years in the premises, in Brisbane Street, later occupied by his successor, George Brockwell Gill. Buildings designed by Samuel Shenton include: * the Queensland Times * Messrs. Hughes and Cameron's buildings * the Ipswich Hospital premises, including the doctor's residence and the Jubilee ward * the North Star Hotel * residences of J. C. Cribb, E. W. Hargreaves, C. C. Cameron, G. R. Wilson. J. W. Daisey, and R. Gill Politics Shenton always took an active part in public matters, having been twice Mayor of Ipswich. He was first elected as an alderman in February, 1863, and served in the Council for three years; was again elected in 1869 for one year; and at the end of that time was again returned, this time at the head of the poll. He occupied the Mayoral chair in the years 1872 and 1873, and during that time had the honour of receiving the Marquis of Normanby and his lady on their first visit to Ipswich, when a public banquet and ball were given to commemorate their visit. In 1888, he was again requested to offer himself as an alderman for the East Ward, and was elected without opposition. He was also connected with most of the societies that tended to promote the welfare of the town and district. In 1854, he was one of the founders of the subscription library and reading rooms, which formed the nucleus of the School of Arts; took an active interest in the Ipswich and West Moreton Horticultural and Agricultural Society, and the Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society, being once or twice president of the latter. For many years in succession he was chairman of the trustees of the Ipswich General Cemetery, and was as a director, and in other ways, connected with several building societies. He was also a director of the Ipswich Gas Company for many years, and was one of the trustees for the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School. He was among the promoters of tihe Queensland Woollen Company, and held the office of director for several years from its foundation, and also took an active part in the establishment of the present Cotton Company. Personal life On 12 January 1953, Samuel Shenton married Eliza Thorpe, a niece of the Rev. Thomas Deacon at the United Evangelical Church in Brisbane. After residing in West Street for several years, he purchased a beautiful site known as Rose Hill, Newtown, where he lived the rest of his life. Later life In March 1891, Shenton had a buggy accident, which crushed his side, and brought on lung disease, eventually developing into pulmonary phthisis. Although he was not able to take that active part in public matters which characterised his life up to the time of the accident, he was able to drive about in his buggy until a week before his death, when he had to take to his bed. Despite every care on the part of his wife and friends he passed peacefully away at his villa residence, Rose Hill, Newtown, at 4:20am on 3 July 1893. The funeral took place at 3 o'clock on 4 July 1893. It was attended by the members of the Ipswich Municipal Council.

As many as 3,000 firefighters including 800 Washington National Guard members were deployed to fight the fires. The 17th Field Artillery Brigade of the United States Army also deployed 200 soldiers from Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord to help fight the fires. On August 21, President Barack Obama declared the fires a federal emergency. Because of the enormous extent of the fire activity, for the first time in Washington state history, officials asked residents to volunteer to assist in fighting the wildfires. On August 24, the Washington Department of Natural Resources announced the Okanogan Complex fire had become the largest fire complex in Washington State history. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources called the season the \\"worst-ever\\" in the state's history. Progression and response June June 2015 was a remarkably hot month for the state of Washington, with average temperatures between above normal conditions, setting new records. By June 23, there had already been 313 wildfires across the state. =Governor's action= Governor Jay Inslee issued a proclamation on June 26, declaring a state of emergency to exist in all Washington state counties, implementing the Washington State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, and ordering deployment of National Guard and other organized militia for incident-related service assistance, all because of the predicted risk of wildfires in the wake of significantly drier-than-average weather in June. The Commissioner of Public Lands Peter J. Goldmark, head of the Washington Department of Natural Resources, issued an updated burn ban to the one issued June 22, as the earlier ban was superseded by the Governor's proclamation. The Commissioner's prohibition of campfires in state forests, state parks and state forestlands until September 30, 2015, was issued June 26, 2015. =Sleepy Hollow fire= Sleepy Hollow Fire (2015) in Monitor close to where it was ignited, heading over the ridge and into the town of Wenatchee, WA A wildfire in 2015 destroyed 29 homes in Wenatchee as well as fruit warehouses and a recycling center. Mop up on a fruit warehouse fire that started at a recycling center from burning embers from a nearby wildfire- the Sleepy Hollow Fire. The season began unprecedentedly early with the Sleepy Hollow Fire on June 28, affecting the city of Wenatchee in Chelan County, Washington. It burned 2,950 acres, destroying 29 homes and several commercial buildings. The cause of the fire is under investigation but is \\"likely human- caused\\". Officials said the fire's unusual intensity was caused by drought and record high temperatures. As a safety precaution, officials banned Fourth of July fireworks in many parts of the state. A man was arrested in connection with the fire, confessing to starting it with a disposable lighter, but faced no charges due to his mental illness. July By July 12, over 16,000 acres had burned, including a single fire near Ephrata, in Grant County, that had burned at least 10,000 acres. Later in the month, another major fire was triggered by farm equipment near Walla Walla and burned more than 6,000 acres over two weeks. August MODIS aerial imagery of Washington on August 22, showing the Puget Sound region covered in smoke from wildfires in Eastern Washington. An airtanker plane dropping fire retardant over the advancing Chelan Butte wildfire (part of the Chelan Complex fire) The extent of wildfires in August 2015 led to the federal declaration of a state of emergency in Washington state by President Barack Obama on August 21, 2015. By August 24, over 16 active fires had burned more than . On August 29 there was concern that unusually strong southerly winds would cause \\"significant growth\\" of the Tunk Block and Lime Belt fires in the Okanogan complex and growth in the Chelan complex fires. The Twisp River and Nine Mile fires were about 95 percent contained. =Chelan Complex= Three fires on the south end of Lake Chelan, near the city of Chelan, merged into a complex fire and forced the immediate evacuation of over 1,000 residents on August 14. By August 16, the Reach Complex Fire had grown to , while the Wolverine fire burned nearly . According to Rico Smith, a spokesman for the firefighters near Chelan, by August 29 \\"about 85 homes, businesses and other residences [had] been destroyed by the Chelan complex fires.\\" =Okanogan Complex= The Okanogan Complex Fire was formed from five separate wildfires in Okanogan County, of which all but one were caused by lightning strikes, burning approximately by August 20. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) authorized the use of federal grants on August 14 for the Nine Mile Fire, one of the five fires that are part of the Okanogan Complex, determining that it constituted a \\"major disaster\\". Over 1,300 residents in the towns of Twisp and Winthrop were ordered to evacuate because of the approaching Twisp River Fire. On August 19, 2015, three firefighters were killed battling a wildfire near Twisp. By August 24, the fire had grown to , surpassing the Carlton Complex fire of 2014 to become the largest wildfire complex in Washington state history. By August 28 \\"at least 45 primary residences, 49 cabins and 60 outbuildings [were] destroyed in the Okanogan complex fires.\\" The size of the complex peaked at on August 30, before the transfer of the Tunk Block Fire under the North Star Fire on August 31. September International assistance After the emergency declaration in August, President Obama asked Australian Fire Services (including those of the Black Saturday bushfires) to aid the depleted American services. By August 24, about 70 fire managers from Australia and New Zealand arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, to be briefed and provided with gear before heading west to fight the fires. Air quality As a result of the wildfires, air quality across the state and into Canada dropped to unhealthy levels in many cities and led to the issuing of several air quality alerts by the U.S. National Weather Service and Environment Canada. Omak, located northeast of the Okanogan Complex fire, reported an air quality index rating of 500 on August 24. The city of Spokane, from the fires, reported a rating of 188 on August 24, forcing high school athletics and other outdoor activities to be canceled. By Tuesday, August 25, Environment Canada had posted an Air Quality Health Index alert for cities as far away as Calgary, Alberta‚Äî‚Äîwith a score of 12. The Canadian Air Quality Health Index, measured on a scale of one to 10-plus with 10 as \\"very high risk\\", is based on measurements of \\"ozone at ground level, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide\\". By Wednesday the third day of the thick haze of smoke, air quality in Calgary scored 17. Smoke from the Chelan Complex fire was pushed westward over Seattle and the Puget Sound region by upper-level winds on August 22, causing hazy weather and worsened air quality for several days. Aftermath In December, Governor Jay Inslee proposed a supplemental budget that included $178 million to cover the costs incurred by the state in fighting the wildfires.

Moccas Court He was born in 1697, the second surviving son of Henry Cornewall, and the first with his second wife Susanna. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 8 July 1714 and entered Lincoln's Inn. He succeeded his father in 1717, inheriting property in Herefordshire which included Moccas Park. In 1721 he made his first move into politics, writing to his cousin the Earl of Oxford, seeking to be appointed parliamentary candidate at Leominster. Oxford replied that he had already promised the seat to Sir Archer Croft, but \\"I have the greatest regard for your family, and should be glad of any opportunity to show the esteem for your person.\\" The following year, he was selected to represent Herefordshire, a seat that he would hold for the next 46 years. On 26 February 1745 he seconded a motion calling for a parliamentary enquiry into the Battle of Toulon the previous year, in which his younger brother James Cornewall had been killed. The motion was passed, and Cornewall appointed to chair a Committee of the Whole House to look into the matter. Cornewall spoke on several occasions in opposition to the Cider Bill of 1763. This stand was popular back home, with Herefordshire a prominent cider-producing county to this day. Ballads were written in his honour, and on 6 June 1763 \\"the High Sheriff, Gentlemen, Clergy, and Freeholders [of Herefordshire] presented an address [...] expressing warmest thanks for [his] diligence and steadiness in opposing the late tax.\\" He married three times. First, in April 1722, to Judith, the daughter of Sir James Herbert and widow of Sir Thomas Powell. Together they had a son who died in infancy. His second wife was Jane, the daughter of Edmund Bray MP, whom he married in October 1734. She died on 10 April the following year. Finally, on 2 April 1737, he married Catherine (d. 1777) the youngest daughter and co-heir of William Hanbury of Byfleet, Surrey. Catherine bore him two children: * Frederick Henry Cornewall, baptised 10 October 1749 but died the same year * Catherine Cornewall (1752-1835), who became his sole heir. Velters died on 3 April 1768 and was buried in Hereford Cathedral. A monument to his memory was erected on the South wall of the Nave.

It entered into service in 1984 and is scheduled to be demolished in 2020. Lighthouses New Low, Old Upper and New Upper Lighthouse New Low Lighthouses Old & New Low  Description  Blankenese Low Lighthouse and Blankenese High Lighthouse form a range of lights for ships sailing upriver on the Elbe. With a range of 8.4 kilometers, they have the longest range on the Unterelbe. The lighthouse is made of concrete and stands 42 meters tall. The column is striped in red and white with a white steel lantern house at the top. The column has 12 portholes facing the river and two on the other side; the lantern has another six. It is positioned approximately 30 meter offshore in the river Elbe and 1,340 meters away from the high lighthouse. On the base of the tower is a 5 m high two- level staircase deck. The tower itself works as a sun clock pointer to the people seating at its shadow. Inside it has a helix staircase going to the top. There is no seating place at the top of the platform, only at the bottom, which by high tide sometimes get washed. At the third floor is a door with a plate showing the function of the structure. However, due to graffiti this plate is covered. The lighthouse is remotely controlled by the Seemansh√∂ft Pilot Centre and belongs to the Hamburg Port Authority.  Construction  Due to the offshore location of the lighthouse, a caisson was used to build the 700 ton concrete foundation to a depth of ten meters below the water surface. The 11 ton lantern house was assembled with the help of a floating crane. The development stage of the range of lights in the early 1980s was met by controversy, including public protests and legal action.  Replacement  Due to adjustments to the Elbe fairway, both the High and the Low Lighthouses are scheduled to be replaced to a similar 33 m high at coordinates and demolished. It is planned to preserve the base of it, but without the steel platform. However, it is not the HPA that decides if and how this socket can be used later. As long as the interests of the port or the shipping industry are not affected, this is the task of other Hamburg authorities.

His father and uncle were killed by the Taliban in 1994. Raziq started fighting against the Taliban in 2001, eventually overthrowing them in the Kandahar area. He was considered to be one of the most powerful security officials in Afghanistan for the last few years of his life. After surviving several assassination attempts over the years by the Taliban, Raziq was killed in an insider attack by a bodyguard of the provincial governor, who opened fire on him and other security officials after a meeting with the U.S. Army General Scott Miller at the governor's compound in Kandahar. Raziq was succeeded by his brother, Tadeen Khan, who has no military related experience. Tadeen's nomination was a result of heavy pressure from powerful tribal elders who pressured the Afghan government to overlook his lack of experience and training. Personal life Abdul Raziq Achakzai was born in 1979 in the town of Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province, where he was raised. He was a member of the Adozai Achakzai tribe of the Pashtuns. He and his family left Afghanistan after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. Raziq's prominent uncle and father were killed by the Taliban in 1994, as they rose to power in Kandahar. He and his family returned after the U.S-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Raziq was illiterate and had three wives. Abdul Raziq Achakzai is thought to have received annual kickbacks from customs revenues exacted at border crossings. He became extremely wealthy as a result of his control over the province and a major border thoroughfare. He also spent time in Dubai and had been heavily involved in horse trading. Abdul Raziq also has businesses abroad. Military career In November 2001, Raziq joined anti-Taliban forces, under Fayda Mohammad and Gul Agha Sherzai, which overthrew the Taliban in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. Although he was unknown in 2001, he nevertheless rose to command the Afghan Border Police on Afghanistan's border between Kandahar and Pakistan's Balochistan Province. Human rights abuses Abdul Raziq Achakzai was alleged to have committed numerous human right violations including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and torture in the Kandahar province. In 2017, the United Nations committee on torture wanted Abdul Raziq to be prosecuted for allegations of torture and enforced disappearances. The committee also stated that Abdul Raziq was 'operating secret detentions centers' where people were being tortured. Abdul Raziq denied all the allegations made against him by the U.N. committee. Apart from Human right organizations and United Nation, locals of Kandahar also accused him of being involved in human right violations. Some Tribal elders and legislators from the province expressed relief over his death. One legislator said that the Kandahar province became less violent after his death. Former president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and other powerful allies sheltered Abdul Raziq from being prosecuted for many years. In 2007, Hamid Karzai blocked western efforts to have Abdul Raziq fired over human rights concerns. In August 2011, United States military banned the transfer of detainees to Afghan authorities in Kandahar. U.S. military stated that they are investigating reports regarding abuse of prisoners by provincial police chief as they have received \\"credible allegations\\" that detainees are being mistreated while in the custody of Abdul Raziq Achakzai. U.S. military spokesman, Col. Gary Kolb, said that U.S. forces won't be handing over detainees to Afghan officials until they are sure that there are no issues. Drug smuggling and corruption Abdul Raziq was also accused of being involved in drug smuggling and corruption cases. US Military officials have acknowledged in front of the members of Congress that Raziq had made millions by collecting major cuts from all the trucks that pass through Spin Boldak crossing. Similarly Canadian Brig.Gen. Jonathan Vance, former commander of NATO-led forces, acknowledged that Abdul Raziq was directly involved in drug smuggling. Matthieu Aikins, in his investigative story in Harper's Magazine, stated that Abdul Raziq made $5 to $6 Million dollars every month through drug smuggling. In 2010, the head of Afghan customs revenue, Bismullah Kammawie, said that every year Afghan government is receiving only a 'fifth of what the government should collect' in customs revenue from the Spin Boldak crossing in Kandahar province. In 2015, an Afghan newspaper, Khaama Press, also reported that the Afghan government was only receiving 1/5th what it should be receiving from the customs border which was under the control of Abdul Raziq. Raziq maintained full control of Spin Boldak crossing until his death.

Investigations into the case caused confusion among the general public, because at first it had been claimed by Puerto Rican police that Cepeda had been raped and murdered, then it was alleged that she died accidentally. Liliana Barbara \\"Barbarita\\" Cepeda Casado (1990‚Äì1997) was a young Puerto Rican girl of African descent. On April 30, 2013, she was, along with Lorenzo Gonzalez Cacho and several other children who have disappeared or died violent deaths in Puerto Rico, remembered at Puerto Rico's Capitol, during a ceremony to promote reduction of mistreatment of minors in Puerto Rico. Case Liliana Barbarita Cepeda Casado was with her family enjoying a day at the beach swimming on June 8, 1997, when she first disappeared at Escambron Beach in San Juan. People began looking for her all over the beach and under water. Her body was found on June 9, in the basement of an abandoned building that hosted what was once an Olympic-sized swimming pool used for the 1979 Pan American Games water competitions. Initially it was said that she had been raped, beaten and murdered. Days after that announcement, however, police recanted, declaring her death as an accidental one. During a press conference, Police chief Pedro Toledo discussed that her 11-year-old brother allegedly admitted that she had fallen to her death as she was playing with him and that, afraid of the consequences this could bring him, her brother claimed she was kidnapped. Toledo later held another press conference, where he admitted his comments could have been misleading. \\"At that time, I understood that we had to put an end to the hysteria (surrounding the case)\\" Toledo told the press that day. On November 16, 1998, Jose Luis Ortiz Vega, Barbarita's stepfatherhttp://www.adendi.com/archivo.asp?num=379921&year;=1999&month;=1&keyword;= and Eugenio J. Rodriguez Galindo were arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of Cepeda Casado. During a preliminary court hearing on December 16 of that year, it was determined there was probable cause to accuse the two of first degree murder and of kidnapping, in addition to gun law violations. A third man, named Eliezer Santana Baez, testified he had witnessed some of what the other two men had been accused of doing. Santana Baez, however, had also declared that he was not there when Cepeda Casado died and that he had been coerced to lie by authorities. It was later argued by the two accused men's defense that some of the evidence offered by prosecution had been in the hands of the public ministry and that they had not been handed to defense until the day of a hearing, 15 January 1999, and as such, the accusations should be discarded. These motions were later dismissed by jury. Six months after being jailed in 1998, both Ortiz Vega and Rodriguez Galindo had to be released due to being jailed without a trial. Santana Baez later alleged that he had lied about the case and a judge then found no cause against Rodriguez Galindo. Santana Baez was later found guilty of the murder of a Puerto Rican dancer.

This is separated by a narrow oblique white streak from an elongate blackish costal blotch, which is somewhat triangular and terminates in a curved reduplicated blackish line in the apical cilia. This blotch contains an outwardly oblique slender line, pointing to a small black spot in a white patch before the apex, another slender white line meeting it at an angle from the dorsum. There is a small pale space on the fold at about half the wing-length, containing a few blackish scales. The terminal cilia is hoary, speckled with greyish fuscous.

Facts Howard William Cheney, a taxpayer, had appealed to the Special Commissioners against an assessments to income tax for 1964-65, made against him under the Finance Act 1964 (and an equivalent assessment to surtax for 1963-64). A substantial part of the income tax collected was used by the UK government to fund the construction of nuclear weapons, which were banned by the Geneva Convention. Cheney argued that the use of income tax and surtax for an illegal purpose had the effect of invalidating the tax assessments made against him. The Special Commissioners ruled that the purpose towards which the taxes collected were to be put was not relevant to the validity of the tax assessments, and that the assessments were therefore valid.

The film became known as a \\"disaster\\". Premise A rising tennis star falls in love with an older woman, a jet- setter who's involved with a millionaire, while playing in the Wimbledon championships. Cast * Ali MacGraw as Nicole * Dean Paul Martin as Chris * Maximilian Schell as Marco * Steve Guttenberg as Randy * Pancho Gonzalez as Himself * Guillermo Vilas as Himself * Ilie NƒÉstase as Himself * John McEnroe as Himself Production Development The film was a passion project of producer Robert Evans, who was an enthusiastic tennis player. He made it under his independent deal with Paramount, where he had been head of production. Evans hired Arnhold Schulman to write a script. There were over 16 drafts. \\"I had a bitter dispute with the writer\\", said Evans. Schulman later recalled: > I got in my contract all of the Dramatist Guild guarantees: I had approval > of the director, not a word [of the script] could be changed without my > consent, and so forth. Immediately after I finished the screenplay, Bob > Evans sent me on a wild goose chase to Rome to cast a part he had already > cast‚ÄîI found out months later‚Äîwith Max Schell. When I got back, I found out > that six or seven writers were working on different versions of the script, > all at the same time with none of them knowing about the other. It was known during production as Getting Off. Anthony Harvey and Robert Evans began scouting locations in Mexico in April 1978. Evans wanted the male lead to be played by someone who was a top level tennis player and could act. In May 1978 Evans announced that the role would be played by Dean-Paul Martin, son of Dean Martin who played tennis professionally for the Phoenix Rackets. \\"He's the next Robert Redford\\", said Evans. \\"It's one of the best screen tests I've ever seen.\\" Martin was reluctant to act and said yes \\"because Bob assured me this was the first film in Hollywood history with this kind of money behind which would show tennis in a totally authentic and good light.\\" Evans signed him to a six-picture contract. He learned about camera technique over several weeks with Tony Franciosa. MacGraw's fee was $500,000. She had only appeared in four movies but they had all been hits. She was Evans' ex-wife and the two, who shared a son, had remained close. \\"She was the best person for the role\\", said Evans. Shooting Filming began shooting in London on 29 June 1979. It includes a scene shot during the 1978 Wimbledon Championships: prior to the start of the ladies' final between Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, the production filmed Dean Paul Martin and Guillermo Vilas walking onto Centre Court and bowing to Princess Margaret and the Duchess of Kent in the Royal Box. Additional filming took place in Mexico, Las Vegas, Monte Carlo and Los Angeles. Shooting had to be suspended at one point when Dean Paul Martin fell ill. Schulman recalled: > The company went to Mexico [for the filming], and I couldn't get Evans to > show me the dailies. I said, \\"Bob, you have no right to do this. Look at > your contract.\\" He said, \\"Sue me!\\" That was the end of that. I had these > things in writing, and they meant nothing!... I did sue him. But I couldn't > take my name off the screen. You can't take your name off the screen if > you're paid a certain amount of money, unless the studio agrees > beforehand‚Äîand they're not going to agree, because if word gets out the > writer took his name off, the picture gets a bad name. Schulman says \\"Not a word\\" of the script was his \\"but I got the credit, the money, and even the credit of executive producer once again, and from the outside, it looks as though I was totally in charge.\\" By July the title was changed to Players. \\"I honestly believe no one's ever made a more realistic film about a sport\\", said Evans. Reception Critical Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"the sort of movie in which the actors serve the function of scenery. They are nice to look at but it's not really possible to identify with a tree or even a lilac bush. Mr. Schulman's dialogue doesn't help, nor does the direction by Anthony Harvey ('A Lion in Winter'), who never discovers a source of narrative energy to compensate for the emptiness of the characters.\\"Canby, Vincent (June 8, 1979). \\"Screen: 'Players' Takes World Tennis Tour\\". The New York Times. C9.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Brendan Gill of The New Yorker wrote, \\"Verisimilitude is achieved during the tennis sequences by furnishing them with people borrowed from real life; those sequences aside, there is little real life to be found in 'Players,' thanks in part to an ill-written script by Arnold Schulman and in part to the incompetence of its star, Ali MacGraw, who is very good-looking and is unable to recite even the simplest lines with conviction.\\"Gill, Brendan (June 18, 1979). \\"The Current Cinema\\".

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"As certain to be laughed off the screen and written off financially as 'Hurricane,' another Paramount loser, 'Players' should clinch MacGraw's reputation as the most ridiculous leading lady of the '70s.

After work at house shows from June 2012 to November 2012, they made their televised debut as a tag team in January 2013, under the leadership of Bray Wyatt as a part of The Wyatt Family stable. Together, they won the NXT Tag Team Championship in May 2013. They moved to the main roster later that year, eventually starting a feud against each other following the split of The Wyatt Family in late 2014. The duo would reunite in May 2015 and subsequently reconcile with Wyatt, reigniting The Wyatt Family. Harper and Rowan suffered injuries during the group's revival, causing the duo to go inactive in 2016, but would eventually return as a team once again in October 2017 under the new moniker The Bludgeon Brothers (their respective ring names were also shortened to simply Harper and Rowan). They would go on to capture the SmackDown Tag Team Championship in April 2018. After losing their titles the following August, they spent time apart due to injuries, ultimately reuniting in September 2019, dropping their Bludgeon Brothers gimmick and re-using their original ring names. However, in the 2019 WWE draft, Rowan was drafted to Raw and Harper was drafted to SmackDown, again splitting the team.  History   The Wyatt Family (2012‚Äì2014)  Rowan signed a WWE contract in February 2011 and Harper in March 2012, with both wrestlers performing in NXT's predecessor Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). After FCW was rebranded to NXT Wrestling, Harper and Rowan debuted on NXT under the leadership of Bray Wyatt to form a faction known as The Wyatt Family in November, with the duo being referred to as Wyatt's \\"sons\\". On the January 23, 2013, episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan entered the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament to crown the inaugural champions, defeating the team of Percy Watson and Yoshi Tatsu in the first round. Following a win over Bo Dallas and Michael McGillicutty in the semi- finals with Wyatt's interference, Harper and Rowan went on to the finals of the tournament, but were defeated by Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey. The Wyatt Family later assaulted Grey (who had suffered a legitimate injury) while Wyatt prevented Bo Dallas from winning a NXT Championship number one contender match due to Dallas refusal to join The Wyatt Family. On the May 2 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan won a triple threat elimination tag team match by lastly pinning Neville to earn a shot at the NXT Tag Team Championship. On the May 8 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan defeated Neville and Dallas, the latter of whom filling in for the injured Grey, to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. After Harper and Rowan won the titles, The Wyatt Family went on to feud with Corey Graves and Kassius Ohno,. On the June 19 episode of NXT, The Wyatt Family defeated the team of Graves, Neville and Ohno. On the July 17 episode of NXT, Harper and Rowan lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to Neville and Graves. Harper (left) and Rowan (right) in April 2014 From the May 27 episode of Raw, WWE aired vignettes promoting the upcoming main roster debut of The Wyatt Family. The vignettes showed the Wyatt Family's backwoods origins and Rowan wearing a sheep mask. On the July 8 episode of Raw, The Wyatt Family made their debut by assaulting Kane. Harper and Rowan made their main roster in-ring debut on the July 26 episode of SmackDown, where they defeated Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai) in a tag team match. Over the next few months, Harper and Rowan competed as a tag team and went on a winning streak over many teams, until Cody Rhodes and Goldust handed them their first loss on the October 11 episode of SmackDown. In early 2014, Harper and Rowan feuded with The Shield, while also supporting Bray Wyatt in his feud with John Cena. While Wyatt and Cena's feud continued, Harper and Rowan also started a feud with The Usos, unsuccessfully challenging for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Money in the Bank and Battleground.  Split and feud (2014‚Äì2015)  On September 29, 2014, vignettes began to air of Bray Wyatt announcing he was setting Luke Harper and Erick Rowan \\"free\\". Rowan returned on the October 31 episode of SmackDown, while Harper returned on the November 10 episode of Raw, aligning himself with The Authority. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Rowan joined Team Cena for Survivor Series, opposing Luke Harper and turning into a heroic character. At the event, Rowan's team was victorious. During the match, Harper and Rowan attacked each other, with Rowan ultimately being eliminated from the match by his former partner (with assistance from Seth Rollins). On the December 8 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan faced each other in singles competition, with Harper ultimately getting himself disqualified. On the January 5, 2015 episode of Raw, The Authority punished Rowan by putting him in a singles match against Harper, with Harper picking up the win after a discus clothesline and the help of J&J; Security (Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury), who were the special guest referees for the match. On the January 22 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan once again competed against each other, this time in a 2015 Royal Rumble qualifying match, with Harper winning and thus not allowing Rowan to participate in the Royal Rumble match. Despite this, Rowan appeared during the Royal Rumble match on January 25, ambushing the number six entrant Curtis Axel, to attack Harper and subsequently sparking a brief Wyatt Family reunion, along with Bray Wyatt, before all three men began to brawl.  Reformation and The Wyatt Family reunion (2015‚Äì2017)  Rowan (left) and Harper (right) in January 2016 On the May 7 episode of SmackDown, Rowan would come out after Harper defeated Fandango, seemingly to confront Harper, but would instead attack Fandango and thus turning into a villain in the process. On the May 11 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan would officially reunite when Harper accompanied Rowan to his match against Fandango which Rowan won after 30 seconds and the two proceeded to double team Fandango after the match. On the May 18 episode of Raw, Harper and Rowan teamed up to take on Fandango and Zack Ryder, which Rowan and Harper won after a superkick and full nelson slam combination. On the June 4 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan cut a promo about being ostracized and stated they were a family. On the June 5 episode of Superstars, Harper and Rowan defeated Los Matadores in a tag team match, and once again in a rematch the following week on Raw. In late June, during a match at a live event, Rowan suffered a torn bicep, with reports saying he would be out of action for 4‚Äì6 months. On the June 23 episode of Main Event, Harper returned to singles competition when he defeated Cesaro, but not before cutting a promo where he said losing his tag team partner has only made him more dangerous. Harper eventually reunited with Bray Wyatt on July 19 at Battleground by helping him defeat Roman Reigns. After four months of inactivity, Rowan returned from injury on the October 19 episode of Raw, when he filled in for Harper (who was unable to show for personal reasons) to team with Wyatt and Wyatt Family newcomer Braun Strowman, against Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, which his team won by disqualification after Ambrose attacked Strowman with a kendo stick. During this time, The Wyatt Family feuded with several teams including The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) and Team ECW (The Dudley Boyz, Tommy Dreamer and Rhyno). In March 2016, Harper suffered a knee injury during a Raw dark match and it was reported that the injury would sideline him for five to six months. On July 19, at the 2016 WWE draft, Wyatt and Rowan were drafted to SmackDown while Strowman was drafted to Raw, separating him from the group. After the draft, Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance, and Harper returned at the close of the SmackDown brand's event No Mercy on October 9 in a match between Wyatt and Randy Orton, whom Harper distracted to help Wyatt win the match, thus realigning himself with the group. Prior to Harper's return, Rowan underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff. During Rowan's absence, Harper betrayed the group, attacking Wyatt and his new ally Randy Orton during the 2017 Royal Rumble. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown, Rowan returned from injury after nearly eight months of inactivity, sporting a new steampunk- style sheep mask, assisting Wyatt in attacking Orton (who had also betrayed Wyatt); Wyatt and Rowan later that went on to lose a tag team match against Orton and Harper. The Wyatt Family seemingly disbanded again when Wyatt was moved to the Raw brand during the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, but despite this Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance, with Wyatt distracting Orton during his match with Rowan on the April 11 episode of SmackDown. Harper and Rowan continued to rival each other until the feud seemingly ended at Backlash on May 21, where Harper defeated Rowan.  The Bludgeon Brothers (2017‚Äì2018)  After months without appearing on WWE programming, on the October 10 episode of SmackDown, Harper and Rowan returned in a repackage vignette, with the duo wielding mallets and calling themselves \\"bludgeon brothers\\". During this time, both Luke Harper and Erick Rowan shortened their ring names, officially being billed as \\"Harper\\" and \\"Rowan\\". After a month of promotion, Harper and Rowan wrestled their return match as The Bludgeon Brothers on the November 21 episode of SmackDown, defeating The Hype Bros. After multiple weeks of defeating enhancement talent in squash matches, the Bludgeon Brothers made an appearance at Fastlane on March 11, 2018, interfering during the SmackDown Tag Team Championship bout between defending champions The Usos and The New Day. This would lead to a triple threat tag team match between the three teams for the title at WrestleMania 34, where the Bludgeon Brothers won, earning their first title as a team on the main roster; this was also Rowan's first title on the main roster, and the first win at WrestleMania for both. They would go on to successfully defend the titles against The Usos at the Greatest Royal Rumble, against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson at Money in the Bank, and against Team Hell No at Extreme Rules. At SummerSlam, Harper and Rowan defended their titles against The New Day; they lost by disqualication after Rowan attacked Xavier Woods with a mallet, marking their first loss as The Bludgeon Brothers. Two days later on SmackDown, Rowan and Harper lost the titles to The New Day in a no-disqualification match, ending their reign at 135 days. The following day, it was announced that Rowan had suffered a torn right bicep, sidelining him indefinitely. During this time, Harper also underwent surgery due to a wrist injury.  Brief reunion and disbandment (2019)  Rowan returned alone on January 29, 2019 at the Royal Rumble pay- per-view, where he aided WWE Champion Daniel Bryan in retaining his title against AJ Styles. On March 9, 2019, Harper returned to in-ring action, defeating Mojo Rawley at a live event. Harper then wrestled at WrestleMania 35 and Worlds Collide before taking an extended hiatus from weekly television, and on April 16, requesting his release from WWE. However, at Clash of Champions on September 15, Harper returned, helping Rowan defeat Roman Reigns and reforming their alliance. The two were then defeated by Roman Reigns and Daniel Bryan at Hell in a Cell in a tag team match. However, in the 2019 WWE draft, Rowan was drafted to Raw and Harper remained on SmackDown, again splitting the team. On December 8, 2019, Luke Harper was released from his WWE contract, thus ending any possibility of Harper and Rowan teaming up in WWE again. On April 15, 2020, Erick Rowan would also be released from his WWE contract as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.

A 1956 rerecorded version of this song would appear on Jones' fourth studio album release in May 1957. Recording and composition Just after a 22-year old Jones signed with Starday Records, he went to Beaumont, Texas to record for his first time. In the living room of producer Jack Starnes (co-founder of Starday), Jones and \\"The Western Cherokees\\" cut five songs, 2 unissued. The first of the recordings was \\"No Money in This Deal,\\" a honky-tonk side that was penned by Jones himself. The songs displayed a great Lefty Frizzell influence, in the vocal styling of the early George and in the lyrics. The song was very similar to Frizzell's 1950 smash hit \\"If You've Got the Money (I've Got the Time).\\" Jones mentions his sisters Joyce and Loyce in the song. ‚ÄúOh, it was just one of them stupid things you write at the time,\\" Jones explained to Nick Toches in the Texas Monthly in 1994. \\"Bunch of junk.

A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles. Computerized solution Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word. First algorithm: # Begin # Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s) # Sort the letters of J in alphabetical order, preserving duplicates # Look up sorted letters in a hash table, initialised with a dictionary, that maps a sorted set of letters to unscrambled words # Print the set of words, which is W # End Second algorithm: #Begin #Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s) #Frame a word list Y with all permutations of J #For each word in Y check if the word is existing in the dictionary #If a match is found then collect it in word list W #Print the words in W # End Algorithm to find the permutations of J: #Begin #Initialize a string with first character of J denoted by J(1) #Add the second character of J denoted by J(2) on either side of J(1) to get two strings J(1)J(2) J(2)J(1) #Add the third character of J denoted by J(3) on either side and in between the above 2 strings to get 6 strings J(1)J(2)J(3) J(1)J(3)J(2) J(3)J(1)J(2) J(2)J(1)J(3) J(2)J(3)J(1) J(3)J(2)J(1) #In the same way add J(4) to each of the above strings in either sides and between two characters to get 24 strings #Continue this until all the characters are completed Though the algorithm looks complex it is easy to program. Douglas Hofstadter developed a program called Jumbo that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would.

The Bangui National Forum was a national reconciliation conference organized by the transition government of the Central African Republic (CAR). It took place in Bangui from May 4 to 11, 2015 and was part of the third phase of the Brazzaville process. Following the Brazzaville ceasefire conference of July 2014 and the CAR popular consultations during the first quarter of 2015, the forum resulted in the adoption of a Republican Pact for Peace, National Reconciliation and Reconstruction in the CAR and the signature of a Disarmament, Demobilisation, Rehabilitation and Repatriation (DDRR) agreement among 9 of 10 armed groups. The Forum was presided by Professor Abdoulaye Bathily, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Central Africa. There were over 600 participants representing the government, civil society, political parties, the media, the diaspora and faith-based organisations.  Purpose  The purpose of the Bangui National Forum was to bring together Central Africans from all regions and backgrounds to find lasting solutions to years of recurrent political instability in the country. The latest episode of conflict broke out in December 2012 when an armed rebellion was launched by the S√©l√©ka Coalition, led by Michel Djotodia, a former defence minister. It resulted in the overthrow of the government of Fran√ßois Boziz√© in March 2013. However, the takeover by the S√©l√©ka Coalition did not end the violence taking a sectarian angle between the pro-Muslim S√©l√©ka Coalition and the predominantly Christian anti-Balaka militias. Several peace initiatives, driven by regional governments, were prompted by the deteriorating security and human rights situation in the country. This included the Summit of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) leaders which took place in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea on the side lines of the 23rd Ordinary Summit of the African Union in June 2014. The ECCAS leaders agreed to establish a three-phase plan to reconcile the country, including a ceasefire conference in Brazzaville in July 2014, popular consultations and the Bangui National Forum. The initial idea for the Bangui Forum stemmed from a workshop organized by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) in June 2014, that had gathered 30 Central African participants from varying backgrounds to analyse and openly discuss the sources of contention which had led to the conflict. This initiative was the first to be held after the 2013 episodes of violence in CAR.  Recommendations  The recommendations resulting from the popular consultations held early 2015 were compiled into four thematic reports and were put forward for debate at the Forum in four thematic sub-committees (Peace and security, Justice and Reconciliation, Governance and Economic and Social Development) and at plenary sessions.Rapport g√©n√©ral d'activit√© de la Commission Pr√©paratoire du Forum National de Bangui, April 2015, p. 18 The deliberations benefited from the technical support of foreign expertise provided by organizations including the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, ECCAS and the African Union (AU). Among others, the following recommendations were adopted during the forum: * the disarmament and reintegration or reinsertion of armed groups, * reform of the security sector, * the creation of a special tribunal to try persons suspected of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, * creation of a peace, reconciliation and reparation commission, * revision of the nationality code, * recognition of two Muslim feasts, * redeployment of administrative services across the country, * investment in infrastructure, education and health, * reform of the judiciary and improved transparency in the management of the country's abundant natural resources.[13] * return and reintegration of refugees and IDPs The delegates also agreed on the extension of the mandate of the transitional government to provide adequate time for the planning of fair elections.  Agreements  The recommendations issuing from the Bangui Forum are contained in a Republican Pact for Peace, National Reconciliation and Reconstruction in the Central African Republic, which was adopted at the end of the Forum. The Pact calls for the immediate implementation of the resolutions of the Forum and for the commitment of the candidates in the upcoming presidential elections to uphold them. To address concerns that the outcomes of the Bangui Forum might not be fully implemented, the President of the Central African Republic, Catherine Samba-Panza announced in her closing address that a monitoring committee would oversee the full implementation. A disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation of ex-combatants (DDRR) was also signed at the end of the Forum by nine out of ten armed groups: the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique (FRPC), the Rassemblement Patriotique pour le Renouveau de la Centrafrique (RPRC), the Union des Forces R√©publicaines Fondamentales (UFRF), the Seleka R√©nov√©e, the Mouvement des Lib√©rateurs Centrafricains pour la Justice (MLCJ), the Coordination des ex-combattants Anti-Balaka, The Unit√© du Peuple Centrafricain (UPC), R√©volution et Justice, and Unit√© des Forces R√©publicaines. The Front D√©mocratique pour le Progr√®s de la Centrafrique (FDPC) did not sign the agreement. The DDRR agreement outlines that ex- combatants should be relocated to designated camps for identification and awareness sessions. They will be either integrated into the security agencies under the National DDRR Programme; returned to their communities and included in various income-generating programmes funded by MINUSCA and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other international partners; or in the case of foreign fighters, not suspected of committing war crimes, they will be repatriated to their home countries. The agreement was well received by national and international public opinion as a milestone in the search for peace in the country. A contributing factor to the achievement of the Bangui Forum and of the DDRR agreement was the signing of peace declarations in Nairobi by former presidents Boziz√© and Djotodia in April 2015. In a surprise move, both men agreed to recognize the recommendations of the Brazzaville ceasefire conference of July 2014 and to support the Bangui Forum. This enabled representatives of the two main armed groups, the S√©l√©ka and Anti- Balaka, to participate at the forum and for security to be respected during the week that it was held. A declaration by armed groups to stop enrolling children into their ranks and to release those already in their possession was also signed on the margins of the Forum. UNICEF reported the release of 357 children by these groups one week after signature.

The hospital is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital and opened at the end of April 2015. The hospital comprises a 1,109-bed adult hospital, a 256-bed children‚Äôs hospital and two major Emergency Departments; one for adults and one for children. There is also an Immediate Assessment Unit for local GPs and out-of-hours services, to send patients directly, without having to be processed through the Emergency Department. The hospital has a dedicated Minor Injuries Unit. It was relocated here in 2020 from the New Victoria Hospital. The retained buildings include the Maternity Unit, the Institute of Neurological Sciences, the Langlands Unit for medicine of the elderly and the laboratory. The whole facility is operated by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. While some parts of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital have their own distinct identity and dedicated specialist staff, such as the Royal Hospital for Children, each is completely integrated with linkages for patient transfer, diagnostic services, emergency care and even a rapid access lift from the emergency helicopter pad on the roof of the adult hospital. For example, the new children‚Äôs hospital is not only linked to the adult hospital but also both the adult and children‚Äôs hospitals are linked to the redeveloped maternity building and to the Neurosciences Institute. The hospital hosts services relocated from the Western Infirmary, the Victoria Infirmary including the Mansion House facility, some services from Royal Infirmary and a range of inpatient services from Gartnavel General Hospital. In addition, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, previously based at Yorkhill, was moved to a new building adjoining the adult hospital and renamed the \\"Royal Hospital for Children\\". The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is one of the largest hospital campuses in Europe. History In 2008, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde submitted a business case to the Scottish Government for a new acute hospital to replace facilities at the Western Infirmary and Victoria Infirmary, and to relocate the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, to a new building adjoining the new adult hospital. Designs were unveiled for the hospital campus in November 2009, with public funding being approved. The adult hospital, children's hospital and laboratory buildings were designed by Nightingale Associates, with construction carried out by Multiplex, who previously built Wembley Stadium. At the time of construction the hospital, originally named the South Glasgow University Hospital, was Scotland's largest ever publicly funded NHS construction project, costing ¬£842 million to build. it was built on and around site of the old Southern General Hospital, with construction starting in early 2011. Originally to be called South Glasgow University Hospital, it was granted the right to use the name \\"Queen Elizabeth University hospital\\" by Queen Elizabeth II. It was originally hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2014, but medical services did not start to be transferred until April 2015, when the first services began being transferred from other hospitals and was fully operational by summer 2016. A physical above ground link for patients and staff from the main building into the Maternity and Neurosciences Institute buildings was constructed, allowing most of the campus to be traversed without going outside. The main hospital facilities are also linked to the laboratory buildings via a tunnel and pneumatic tube system. The retained buildings from the former hospital, notably the Institute of Neurological Sciences, also started to receive external and internal refurbishment, with a cosmetic panel cladding being applied to the outside of the building in order to bring its appearance in- line with the new hospital buildings at a cost of circa ¬£40 million. When the hospital opened its doors, locals nicknamed it the \\"Death Star\\" due to its star-shaped design, large size and the landing pad for aircraft on the roof.\\"¬£842m ‚ÄòDeath Star‚Äô hospital opens doors to first patients\\", National Health Executive, 27 April 2015. Retrieved 4 September 2015. In February 2020, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde started legal proceedings against Multiplex, Capita Property & Infrastructure, and Currie & Brown for an estimated ¬£73 million in losses and damages relating to technical issues at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children. Services Adults' hospital The adult hospital - in height, 14 storeys with four 'wings'  features 1,109 patient rooms. Rooms within general wards have an external window view. Each room is equipped with private shower and toilet facilities in addition to entertainment such as television and radio. The first floor houses a 500-seat hot food restaurant and a separate cafe. The atrium features shops and banking machines and a lift system that automatically guides users to the lift that will take them to their destination most efficiently. In addition to a canteen and coffee shop, the atrium in the adult hospital building also contains retail outlets including include: Marks & Spencer; WHSmith; Camden Food co; and Souped Up & Juiced. There are also cash machines located in the hospital. It is estimated that the hospital serves 41% of Scotland's population. Children's hospital The Royal Hospital for Children, while retaining a somewhat separate identity, is adjoined and integrated with the adult hospital. With 256 beds and five floors, it replaced the Royal Hospital for Sick Children located in Yorkhill, Glasgow. Maternity Unit The maternity unit, which was built in 1970 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, is situated directly across from the children's hospital facilities. Institute of Neurological Sciences The Institute of Neurosciences, which was built in 1972 and has been retained from the Southern General Hospital, provides Neurosurgical, Neurological, Clinical Neurophysiology, Neuroradiological, Neuropathology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery facilities for the West of Scotland. Attached to the institute is The Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Unit for Scotland which provides a spinal injuries service to the whole of Scotland.

He is the first ever member of the parliament of Romani heritage in Turkey, elected in 2015.Yinan√ß, Bar√ßƒ±n. \\"Increased visibility has led to a serious drop in prejudice against the Roma\\". Hurriyet Daily News, 16 April 2018) Private life √ñzcan Pur√ßu was born at S√∂ke, Aydƒ±n Province, where his parents of Romani heritage migrated in the 1950s from √áanakkale. He was one of three siblings in the family. He was born and raised in a plastic tent, which was as big as to hold two beds only, and needed to be replaced every three months because torn down. The toilet and the bathroom were outside the tent erected in a Romani neighborhood. Running water had to be supplied from the nearby mosque's fountain.

His father tried to marry off him with a young girl from the neighboring tent. As he rejected to get married, his father beat him, and burned his books and shoes. √ñzcan was forced to walk to the school in his mother's slippers. He completed his secondary education as the school's best pupil and with honors. He wanted to become a kaymakam, district governor in Turkey as public administrator, because, as he told, every Romani had to apply to the district governor's office, which he believed was the zenith of the state.

She was a daughter of Katsia II Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. After the Russian conquest of Imereti and Solomon's flight to the Ottoman Empire in 1810, Mariam fell in the hands of the Russian authorities who sent her in exile to Russia proper, where she was known as Maria Katsiyevna Imeretinskaya ().  Family background  Mariam was born in 1783, in the family of the Mingrelian ruling prince Katsia II, of the Dadiani dynasty, and his wife Elisabed, daughter of Teimuraz II of Kakheti. She was given in marriage, in the 1790s, to the Imeretian king Solomon II, who later fought his brother-in-law and Katsia's successor, Grigol Dadiani, over territorial disputes. The marriage proved to be childless. Therefore, Solomon had to designate his closest legitimate relative and a son of an old adversary, Prince Constantine, as heir apparent in 1804.  Downfall  Solomon's reign was under threat from the Russian Empire, whose suzerainty he had accepted in 1804. He offered armed resistance to the Russian troops sent in to reinforce the tsar's decision to depose Solomon in February 1810. Mariam stood by her husband's side. Solomon was forced to capitulate in March 1810, but he escaped from captivity and reignited an anti-Russian rebellion in May 1810. The Russian commander-in-chief Alexander Tormasov retaliated by ordering General Simonovich to incarcerate Mariam, her sister Maria, wife of Prince Davit Mikeladze, and Solomon's sister Mariam, wife of Prince Malkhaz Andronikashvili, at the fortress of Poti. The arrested noblewomen were to receive food from their own estates; giving money to them was prohibited. Simonovich advised caution, warning that harsh treatment of the female dignitaries would exasperate the Imeretians.  Arrest and exile  Mariam remained with her beleaguered husband until the king eventually escaped to the Ottoman territory in September 1810. Queen Mariam, on the other hand, fled to Mingrelia under protection of its ruler, Princess Nino. Tormasov inveigled her into surrendering. The Russian military convoy escorted her and other Imeretian female royals to Tiflis and placed them under custody in November 1810. Queen Mariam and Solomon's sister Mariam, as the fugitive king's corroborators, were deported to Voronezh, whence the queen sent, with the help of Marquis Paulucci, a letter to Solomon, urging him to surrender and return from his exile in the Ottoman Empire. After the death of Solomon in Trebizond in 1815, Mariam was allowed to move to Moscow, and then to St. Petersburg in 1817. The tsar granted her a pension and decorated her with the Order of St. Catherine, Grand Cross. According to one account, in her last years, Mariam personally asked the tsar to allow Solomon II's peasant servant Salaridze, who had helped the king to escape from Russian captivity back in 1810, to return from his exile in Siberia. The permission was granted and Mariam hosted Salaridze at her house, only to find him dead of a heart attack on the next morning. Mariam died in St. Petersburg in 1841, at the age of 58, and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery.

Located on Calais Street and Main Street, the district includes twenty properties developed between the early 19th century and 1900. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The town of Calais, Maine is located in Down East Maine, just across the Saint Croix River from Saint Stephen, New Brunswick. The 19th century was a period of significant growth and development as a lumber processing center, with shipbuilding also an important industry in the first half of the century. Main Street was laid out running roughly northwest-to-southeast along the river bank, and Calais Street developed as a residential street running southwest from Main Street. Calais Street is notable for its wide grassy median, and it was at the junction of the two streets that the first Congregational Church was built in 1826. (It was later moved, and the 1873 building that replaced it is now a community center. The historic district includes three blocks on the south side of Main Street east of Calais Street, and two blocks on both sides of Calais Street. The oldest house in the district, dating to the Federal period, is the Holmes Cottage. Built sometime before 1831, it is a modest 1-1/2 story cottage with a long history of association with Calais' doctors. Now owned by the local historical society, it stands on Main Street next to the 1850 Dr. Job Holmes House, one of the town's finest Italianate houses. The Greek Revival is the most common architectural style found in the district, and there are only three houses built after 1880.

Description and history The Hawkes Pharmacy building is located on the west side of Main Street (United States Route 1A) in the heart of the village center of York Beach, a summer resort village on the coast of northern York, Maine. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a roofline that has three large gables on the (east-facing) front and two on the south. These gables are all decorated with Tudor Revival half-timbering, vergeboard in the eaves, and finials at the peaks. The central gable on the front has an arch at its center, with a balcony projecting over the building's front entrance. On the ground floor there are two storefronts. The building was constructed in 1902 by Wilson and Ralph Hawkes, a father-son pair the elder of whom had operate a pharmacy in York Beach since 1899. The building initially housed the pharmacy in one storefront, and a dry goods store in the other, with the proprietor living upstairs. Ralph Hawkes continued to operate the pharmacy until the 1940s, when a fire extensively damaged the interior. The building was rehabilitated in the 1900s, with the upstairs converted into small hotel.

The term is an extension of the Belchen Triangle.  Geographical description  The heart of the Belchen System is the southernmost mountain of the Vosges, the Alsatian Belchen (Els√§sser Belchen or Ballon d'Alsace, 1,247 metres). Seventy three kilometres due east is the Black Forest Belchen (Schwarzw√§lder Belchen, 1,414 metres), which is only 167 metres higher and over which the sun rises at the equinoxes, i.e. at the beginning of spring and autumn. Conversely, the sun sets over the Alsatian Belchen on these days when seen from the Black Forest Belchen. From the Alsatian Belchen, at the time of the summer solstice, the sun rises over Little Belchen (Kleiner Belchen or Petit Ballon, 1,272 metres), 27 kilometres away to the northeast. At the winter solstice it rises over the Swiss Belchen (Schweizer Belchen or Belchenflue, 1,099 metres), 88 kilometres to the southeast. Thus from the Alsatian Belchen the start of all four astronomical seasons is defined. In addition, the sun rises over the highest mountain of the Vosges, the Great Belchen (Gro√üer Belchen or Grand Ballon, 1,424 metres) 21 kilometres to the northeast, on 1 May. The region of the Belchen System is known today as the Upper Rhine, the Regio Basiliensis, the Dreiland or RegioTriRhena.

He served on the Virginia House of Delegates from 1875 to 1877. Early life Not much is concretely known about Commodore's early life. He was born into slavery around 1819 and 1820, possibly in Essex County, Virginia. He took two wives. Commodore married his first wife Lettie (or Letty) while still a slave and she died at some unknown point in time. By 1870 he was recorded as being married to Catherine (or Katherine). Commodore was described as a large man with a strong presence and was known for his leadership qualities. This reputation led him to be selected for jury duty when Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase called for respectable African-Americans to serve on the grand jury. Commodore was not selected per his request, as he was willing to serve on the jury but did not have anyone to monitor his business while the court was in session. He declined to accept money for his travel expenses, as travel to the courthouse had been slightly difficult for him, but eventually took the money after being pressed. This interaction impressed both Chase and the United States marshal involved in the event and both men would later write about this interaction. Politics In November 1875 Commodore was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he represented Essex County. His opponent, Albert R. Micou, challenged the election but this challenge was dismissed. Commodore did not serve on the House of Delegates after 1875 but did remain active in politics. On July 31, 1884, he had to defend himself in the Richmond Daily Whig newspaper when some local Democrats alleged that several armed African Americans had been seen at a polling location in Tappahannock during the 1883 elections, which gives off the impression that Commodore was potentially literate during this point in time. Commodore died on June 24, 1892, likely in Tappahannock, Virginia. In 2013 Commodore was one of several African Americans that were commemorated by the Commonwealth of Virginia for their service to the Virginia House of Delegates during the time period of 1869 to 1890.

The band currently consists of lead vocalist and drummer Donovan Melero, lead guitarist Shane Gann, rhythm guitarist Aric Garcia, and bass guitarist John Stirrat. The band is known for their eclectic progressive rock and math rock styles, along with traditional elements of screamo and post-hardcore. They released their debut studio album, POW!

Memorial Craik eventually inherited a half-share in the Flimby estate, but no part of her father's at Arbigland, which went to a distant male relative, John Hamilton. She died unmarried at Flimby Hall on 11 June 1825. Her obituaries and her memorial in the village church call her a published author in English and French (works in the latter have not survived) and a philanthropist to the poor, a theme that appears in her novels.

Originally developed by Nokia as HERE Maps, the mapping software application was first released for Windows Phone and the World Wide Web in 2013 as a revamped version of Nokia Maps. The Here Maps application was then released for the Android platform on 10 December 2014 and later for iOS on 11 March 2015, and the name was changed to Here WeGo in July 2016. It is also the default maps service provider for the Amazon Fire tablets and smartphone. The data is provided in-house by HERE, which includes satellite views, traffic data, and other location services. Maps are updated every two or three months. Timeline and availability Nokia/Ovi Maps In 2006, Nokia purchased a Berlin-based start-up, Gate5, with a mapping software called smart2go. In February 2007 Nokia announced that smart2go would be available free on the S60 Symbian platform and on Windows Mobile 5.0. It was pre-installed on handsets, including Nokia N95, which featured Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. In August 2007 the smart2go application was reworked into Ovi Maps, named under the new umbrella Ovi brand, released for S60 3rd Edition devices. Months later, Nokia bought Navteq, a provider of digital map systems. Ovi Maps version 2.0 went into public beta in February 2008 and released in May. Version 3.0 was released in July 2009. Turn-by-turn navigation and traffic information originally required a subscription, but in January 2010 Nokia announced that these would be provided for free. In 2011 it became Nokia Maps. It was released for Nokia Lumia in November 2011, coming preloaded on the devices. Versions for the Nokia N900 and Nokia N9 were also made. HERE Maps In November 2012, Nokia rebranded Nokia Maps as HERE Maps. The rebranded version was first released for iOS and later in February 2013 for all Windows Phone 8 devices. It was also released on the Nokia Asha platform and Firefox OS. The legacy Symbian and Series 40 versions carried using the old name without HERE branding. The Here application was first announced for Android as a beta test version for some Samsung Galaxy smartphones on 29 August 2014. The app was downloadable from 8 October 2014 from Samsung's Galaxy Apps Store. It was also launched on the same day for the Samsung Gear S smartwatch. The first public release of the beta Here app (across all of the Android platform was on 21 October 2014, as an APK download from the HERE.com Web site. The app became available in the Google Play store from 10 December 2014. On 12 February 2015 a stable version of HERE was released on the Google Play store. The Web site wego.here.com (formerly here.com) evolved out of the maps.ovi.com and then maps.nokia.com site and provides the web companion to the Here suite. It works on all major browsers. Users can organise their favourite places on collections and sync to mobile devices. The Web application also uses WebGL to offer 3D map views without a plugin. With 3D goggles, users can get stereoscopic views of 25 cities. It also provides detailed street-level imaging for many cities. As of 2013 the Web site offers routing support between many waypoints, city pages of over fifty popular cities showing local time and weather conditions, along with information from Lonely Planet and suggested places, 3D maps of 25 cities, with routing support. Live traffic flow visualisation. public transport search, synchronisation of user's points of interest (Collections) between the Web site and mobile device. heatmaps visualising areas popular for food, nightlife, shopping and local sights in select cities, listing and managing businesses (Here PrimePlaces). On 9 July 2015 HERE launched a new public beta of its Android app. As of June 2015 the Here app was available as a free app in 118 countries and territories across the world for the Android and iOS platforms. On 3 September 2015 Here announced that its app would be available for the Samsung Gear S2 when the smartwatch is released later this fall. In late 2015 Facebook began using HERE's maps for their applications, moving from Microsoft's map offering, Bing. In December 2015, Here, at the time a division of Nokia, was sold to a consortium of German automotive companies (comprising Audi AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG) as Here Global BV.Nokia completes next stage of transformation with agreement to sell HERE to automotive industry consortium at an enterprise value of EUR 2.8 billion , Nokia.

HERE Maps licensed by Microsoft are still offered as part of the existing Bing Maps-based software on these devices. Here WeGo On 27 July 2016 the mapping service was updated and re-branded HERE WeGo; the update first launched on Android, and is followed by an iOS version and a relaunch of the web version. The update and rebranding focuses on navigation capabilities, including the addition of taxi fare information in some cities, and integration with Daimler's Car2Go service. Tizen smartphone and smartwatch apps have been rebranded, too. In April 2020 HERE WeGo introduced CarPlay integration for iOS. The Android version was also published in Huawei App Gallery. As a response to COVID-19 delivery tools demand, HERE WeGo Deliver product was launched. Features Some features are available offline with a downloaded map, others require a data connection, and some also require the user to be signed in. Turn-by-turn navigation HERE WeGo provides turn- by-turn navigation in both offline and online modes. Users can enter a destination address, landmark, or business name, and then the app automatically calculates directions and distance to the destination. Real-time traffic data (where available) is also factored and a prediction made on arrival time to the destination. Depending on the smartphone model, HERE WeGo provides high quality pre-recorded navigation voices, as well as text-to- speech commands with street names. Public transport, pedestrian, and bicycle navigation Public transport data is displayed by the Here app whilst planning a route while online, for transport options such as buses, trams, subways and trains.

Time and distance estimates are provided for these modes, and driving navigation. Real-time traffic and reversible lane traffic HERE WeGo had real-time information on traffic conditions and incidents available for 63 countries. In late June 2015 HERE added real-time traffic for reversible express lanes across the United States and Europe. 'Collections' and location sharing Users can save the location and details of destinations as 'Collections' if they are online and signed in. It is not possible to store destinations offline, on the device. Location and destination can be shared with standard platform tool. there was no option to sort collections by name or distance in the Web, Android, and iOS versions. Offline maps HERE WeGo can download maps of countries and regions to internal storage so that a data connection is not needed for navigation. Online usage provides live traffic data and additional venue information. The maps include floor-by-floor details of some large indoor venues such as shopping malls and airports. CarPlay and Android Auto If a car is equipped with CarPlay connectivity component, HERE WeGo application on iPhone can be projected to the car in-dash navigation screen and controlled as any other built-in application. Up to July 2020 there were no public information about introducing Android Auto integration.

Early life  Gill was born at Castletown, Isle of Man, the son of Henry C Gill and nephew of Hugh Gill. He studied at Finsbury Technical College under Professor Ayrton and also at the Royal College of Science for Ireland and Liverpool University.Isle of Man People  Career  He joined the United Telephone Company at the age of sixteen, eventually managing the Ireland branch which had been taken over by the National Telephone Company. In 1902 he moved to their London office to become Engineer-in Chief.IEE Obit Until 1912 the NTC provided the majority of the telephone service in Great Britain, but it was run on a franchise from the Post Office who also had the right to buy out NTC after a fixed period. After the Post Office exercised that right, Gill formed a partnership with W.W Cook and together they carried out international telephone work in several countries. During World War I Gill was appointed to the Ministry of Munitions obtaining the rank of Controller of the Central Stores. In recognition of this work he was made an OBE. After the war Gill dissolved his partnership with Cook.Gazette 1919 In 1922 he became president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers and in his presidential address he proposed that Europe should have a long distance telephone system equivalent to that of AT&T; in the USA, who ran a service between New York and San Francisco. As a result of his address, the French took the initiative to try to make this a reality. They convened a meeting of delegates from six of the western European states to form an international consultative committee (CCIF), to decide on the technical standards required as different countries used different telephone systems. Sir Norman Kipping spent five years under Gill as a transmission engineer developing the transcontinental telephone system, but ultimately, the European states were keen to preserve their national sovereignty so Gill's ideas weren't fruitful for many years. From 1919 until 1928 he was the European chief engineer of International Western Electric, a division of the Western Electric Company. In this capacity, he had access to new research materials such as Permalloy which he introduced to Alan Blumlein who at that time, worked in the transmission laboratory. The company subsequently became International Standard Electric Corporation and then, later on, Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). In 1925 Western Electric's European operations were acquired by ITT Corporation and in 1928 Gill became vice president. He also held the position of Executive vice president of the Spanish Telephone Company, Compania Telef√≥nica Nacional de Espana who had been part of ITT‚Äôs expansion. During this time he was responsible for reconstructing the Spanish telephone system and in recognition of his work, he was admitted to the Order of Isabella the Catholic. The Emperor of Japan awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasure third class, for services to the Japanese Government on 29 July 1930. Gazette 1930  Wireless  In 1922, the first official radio broadcast triggered a demand from many other stations to apply for broadcast licenses from the GPO. It was evident to the Postmaster General that chaos could occur if all the licences requested were issued and the best solution would be to have just one broadcasting company. In the interests of all parties concerned, it was decided that the initial meeting to discuss the issue would be held on neutral territory and thus the Institute of Electrical Engineers was chosen. As President of the IEE Gill chaired the preliminary committee to establish one broadcasting company and this led to the foundation of the BBC.  Later life  Gill was chairman of the Telephone Development Association in 1935 and 1941 and it is evident from the war diary of Sir Clifford Copland Paterson that Gill‚Äôs position in British Industry contributed towards the war effort during this period. In 1941 he was made a KCMG in recognition of his services to the telephone industry.Gazette In 1946 he was made an Honorary Member of the CCIF, who later became ITU-T. Gill made his last radio broadcast in February 1947 for the centenary celebration of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell. For modernisation of the Shanghai Telephone Company, he was awarded the Order of Brilliant Star in 1949.Gazette 1949 Gill was drawn into controversy in 2003 over who actually invented the telephone when archived documents unearthed by the Science Museum, London suggested that a device made by Johann Philipp Reis and tested by STC in 1947 would pre-date Alexander Graham Bell by 15 years. It was suggested that Gill, who was head of STC at that time, suppressed these findings as STC were negotiating a contract with AT&T; and didn‚Äôt want to compromise the deal.  Death  Frank Gill was involved in telecommunications right up until his death which occurred whilst attending meetings of the International Consultative Committee on Telecommunication (CCIF) in Geneva Switzerland.

John McKenzie House The house as seen from streetside, with an Ontario Heritage Plaque. The John McKenzie House, a three-storey brick structure, located north of Sheppard Avenue, just east of Yonge Street, was constructed in 1913 as the second Willowdale home of a pioneer family. The house is located on lot 18, concession 1, East Yonge Street, on property deeded to Jacob Cummer in 1801. In 1884, a portion of the original property was sold to Philip McKenzie (John's father) who was an English immigrant trained as a carpenter and casket maker. Philip and his wife, Sarah Thompson, of Whitchurch Township, moved originally into the old Cummer farmhouse, a -storey brick Georgian style dwelling. This house, built about 1840, was located between Parkview and Norton Avenues and faced west to Yonge Street. When Philip McKenzie died, John ran the farm and specialized in Holstein cattle until the local economy for farmers began to deteriorate. John then decided to subdivide the farm, and in 1912, registered the \\"Empress Subdivision\\" that was to become the heart of modern east Willowdale as the area was transformed from a rural village to a suburban community.Kennedy, Scott. Willowdale: Yesterday's Farms, Today's Legacy. Dundurn. Toronto, 2013. In 1913, John and his wife, Eva, chose a large lot on the rise of land just east of Yonge Street on Parkview Avenue as the site for their new home. Built in a style which has been described as Queen Anne Revival, Arts and Crafts, and Edwardian, this red brick house contains 12 rooms and 3 bathrooms. The front of the house is profiled by a grand L-shaped, wrap-around verandah with stylized Doric columns. A large attached coach house was converted to accommodate automobiles and has a recreation room above. Significant interior features include the centre hall plan, a vestibule door and sidelights with bevelled leaded glass, a large leaded art glass window which lights the landing of the main staircase, two sunrooms, panelled doors and wainscotting, strip hardwood flooring and radiators. From their farm, the McKenzies retained the 1907 brick milk house, and built a stable in 1915 and a coach house in 1918.\\"History of John McKenzie House.\\" The Ontario Historical Society.\\"Special 100th Anniversary Insert ‚Äì 1913 to 2013 The Historic John McKenzie House\\" July 2013.

Following an extensive fundraising campaign, The Ontario Historical Society restored all four buildings, and obtained protection for the house as a designated heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act. It is now the headquarters of The Ontario Historical Society. A research-reference library can also be found above the coach-house, containing thousands of books pertinent to Ontario‚Äôs history.

Final Report Submitted to Florida Department of Transportation, Project BD544-20: Tampa, FL. It relates the heat generated by curing of cement to the integrity and quality of drilled shafts, augered cast in place (ACIP) piles and other concrete foundations. In general, a shortage of competent concrete (necks or inclusions) is registered by relative cool regions; the presence of extra concrete (over-pour bulging into soft soil strata) is registered by relative warm regions. Cement temperatures are either sampled throughout the concrete hydration process Piscsalko, G., Cotton, D., October 2011. Non-Destructive Testing Methods for Drilled Shaft and ACIP Piles. Proceedings from Deep Foundations Institute 36th Annual Conference on Deep Foundations: Boston, MA; 252-532. or a test is conducted at a time prior to the peak curing temperature having been reached. Either way, measurements are available relatively soon after pouring (6 to 72 hours), typically earlier than when other integrity testing methods such as cross hole sonic logging and low strain integrity testing can be performed. Temperatures are measured along the entire depth of the foundation. If records at a certain depth show regions with cooler temperatures (when compared to the average temperature at that depth), a concrete deficiency or defect may be present. An average temperature at a certain depth that is significantly lower than the average temperatures at other depths may also be indication of a potential problem. It is also possible to estimate the effective area of the foundation, and to assess if the reinforcing cage is properly aligned and centered.Sellountou, A., Alvarez, C., Rausche, F., April 2013.

This temple has great religious importance in Hinduism and is dedicated to the goddess Annapurna. Annapurna is the Hindu goddess for nourishment and is a form of the goddess Parvati. The current Annapurna Mandir was constructed in the 18th century by Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I. History Annapurna Devi Mandir was constructed in 1729 AD by Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao. Construction The temple is constructed in Nagara architecture and has sanctum with large pillared porch, which houses a picture of goddess Annapurna. The temple also houses two icons of the goddess; one made of gold and other of brass. The brass icon is available for daily darshan (viewing & worship). The gold icon can be only seen once a year; on Annakut day. Legend In Hindu mythology, there are two popular beliefs behind the origin of this temple. According to one belief, once the goddess Parvati closed all three eyes of her husband Shiva. Due to this, the entire world was filled with darkness. Parvati stole her fair complexion (Gauri form). She asked Shiva for his help to reacquire her Gauri form. Shiva asked her to donate anna (food) in Varanasi. Hence, she took the form of Annapurna (the goddess of food) with a golden pot and ladle, and donated food in Varanasi. According to another belief, once Shiva commented that the entire world (including food) is maya (illusion). Parvati, the goddess of food, got angry and decided to demonstrate the importance of food by making all the food on earth disappear. The world started to suffer due to hunger. Shiva finally came to Parvati and acknowledged the importance of food, begging for food at her door. Parvati became happy, offered food by her own hands to Shiva and then made a kitchen in Varanasi for her devotees. Location Annapurna Devi Mandir is situated in Visheshwarganj, Varanasi. It is situated 15 meters North-West of the famous Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, 350 meters West of Manikarnika Ghat, 5 kilometers South-East of Varanasi Junction railway station and 4.5 kilometers North-East of Banaras Hindu University.

They are best known for their work on a number of large-scale public concrete murals during the 1960s and 1970s, many of which remain around the UK today. Their mural work often included elements relating to the cultural and industrial heritage of the location they were sited and is part of a tradition of muralists that includes William Mitchell and Kenneth Budd amongst others. Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot were both prominent members of the Colchester Art Society and exhibited together on a number of occasions. Henry Collins Henry Collins was an artist and designer born in Colchester in 1910. He was the son of Henry Percy Collins and his wife Mary n√©e Beagley. He studied at the Colchester School of Art and the Central School, London. During World War II he served in the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers. After the war, Collins worked as a freelance designer and established himself as an artist following a commission by the Central Office of Information at the Festival of Britain in 1951.Mason, E.2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp22-23 Collins was also an educator teaching at St Martin‚Äôs School of Art, London and the Colchester School of Art and was a founding member of the Colchester Art Society.

The artists also collaborated on a number of public concrete murals which they signed collectively as ‚ÄòHenry and Joyce Collins'. Concrete Murals by Henry and Joyce Collins Concrete mural sculpture by Henry and Joyce Collins, on the wall of Sainsburys, Bexhill Well known works by Henry and Joyce Collins include a series of concrete murals they completed together. These murals can be seen in their hometown of Colchester, Essex in the St Botolph‚Äôs Circus underpass; the Crouch Street underpass; and on the fa√ßade of the Sainsbury‚Äôs supermarket in Priory Walk. In April 2012, Firstsite funded a project to restore and relocate a series of three reliefs to 15 Queen Street, Colchester. These works by Henry and Joyce Collins were completed for the fa√ßade of the British Home Stores, Colchester in 1976 and were previously installed in the Lion Walk Shopping Centre until its redevelopment in 2009. Other concrete murals by Henry and Joyce Collins can be seen in other locations in the UK including a mural in Hamtun Street, Southampton which narrates the history of the city; the Stockport British Home Stores also depicting the history of the city; Newcastle Through the Ages (1974) located on the Primark in Newcastle; and Sainsbury‚Äôs supermarket, Burkhurst Place, Bexhill-on-sea. These works are an example of Post-war mural art that was popularised following the Festival of Britain in 1951. The early process Pallot and Collins used to make these concrete murals included the use of plastic moulds. The relief was made in reverse and then poured concrete was put into the moulds. The moulds themselves would then be broken in order to remove the concrete mural.Mason, E.2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp22-23 Later the couple would go on to use wooden moulds with a releasing agent which meant that moulds could be re-used.Wood, K. 2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp24-25 Pallot and Collins would often extensively research the history of an area before starting a mural and would often allude to the city's history in the mural itself including references to important local figures and events.Wood, K. 2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp24-25 According to the Twentieth Century Society, as many as one thousand murals were made between the end of the Second World War and the 1980s in the UK and were a product of the post war building boom. The Twentieth Century Society has launched a campaign to preserve some of these murals, as some have been destroyed in the redevelopment of cities in UK such as the 2008 destruction of a mural by Ray Howard-Jones in Cardiff and another by Mitzi Cunliffe in Sunderland.

Opened in 1886, the station was closed when the new railway and bus terminal was opened in 2011. History The station was opened in 1886 Mar del Plata in 1910 Platforms and sign In August 1861, Edward Lumb, a British entrepreneur, requested the concession of a railway line, initially projected to run from Constituci√≥n to Chascom√∫s, 120 km from Buenos Aires. During a visit to Mar del Plata, Governor of Buenos Aires, Dardo Rocha, saw the potential of the city, assuring a promising future for it. Before leaving the city, he promised to call manager of Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (the British company that had built the lines in the south of the province), Guillermo Moores, to request the extension of the railway line from Maip√∫ to Mar del Plata. Moreover, Rocha stated that in case the BAGSR declined the request, the Provincial Government would finance the construction of the line to the coast city. On September 26, 1886, the first train arrived to the city of Mar del Plata, which was the main tourist destination during summer season. By 1910 Mar del Plata was the main beach city of Argentina, receiving a huge number of tourists during the summer. Due to the intense traffic of passengers, the railway station exceeded its capacity and the Municipality demanded the company to increase the facilities. The company had always denied to this request alleging that the station was only overcrowded during two months per year (the period of summer season in Argentina).Estaci√≥n Mar del Plata Norte on Fotos Viejas de Mar del Plata blog, 14 Jun 2010 During the first decade of the 20th century, the urban development of Mar del Plata moved from the downtown to the South West (nearest to the coast) so the train station was far from the residences and hotels where the tourist were hosted. In June 1908, the Congress promulgated Law 5.535, authorizing the BAGSR to build a new station in Mar del Plata. Although the construction of a new station had been approved, a residents' committee (led by Mar del Plata pioneer Pedro Luro) opposed the old station being demolished, requesting its preservation. Percy Clarke, manager of the company had to accept the residents' claim. The other point of conflict with the inhabitants of the city was the path of the new line. While the company wanted to build the new station near to the coast (to reduce costs), the residents demanded that the station should be located far from the most populated areas of the city. Eventually, the BAGSR agreed to build the new station where the neighbours had demanded.Estaci√≥n Mar del Plata Sud on Fotos Viejas de Mar del Plata blog, 28 Feb 2011 With a project designed by Belgian Architect Jules Dormal, works began in 1909 and finished one year later, when the station building began to be constructed. The project of the company also included to extend the tracks to the city of Miramar. The new station in Mar del Plata (named \\"Mar del Plata Sud\\") was opened on December 1, 1910, although the main building was not still finished, so a provisional wooden-structure was opened to the public for the 1910‚Äì11 summer season. As Mar del Plata Norte remained active, the Sud station would be only used during the summer seasons. It had two large platforms, the main building, a post warehouse, and a signal cabin. When the new station opened, all the trains that arrived to the old station were reprogrammed to make their arrival to the South station. It totalled four services per day, including the two express services. Nevertheless, a few days before the inauguration, the BAGSR requested to the Government that only the express services arrived to the new station, due to the other three trains programmed having to end their routes in Miramar and could not change their path to the south station. The request was approved and therefore only the express services stopped at the new station. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised in 1948,Ferrocarriles: de los or√≠genes a la estatizaci√≥n de Per√≥n by Claudia Ferri on La Izquierda Diario, 17 Apr 2015 Mar del Plata became part of General Roca Railway, one of the six divisions of state-owned Ferrocarriles Argentinos. On May 3, 1949, the Mar del Plata Sud station was definitively closed so Mar del Plata Norte became the only station in the city. In 1951 Ferrocarriles Argentinos acquired a total of 46 coaches from American Budd Company, used for The Marplatense, a luxury service from Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata. In 1952 the FADEL locomotives were added to tow the Marplatense express with a journey time of 3 hours and 45 minutes. FA ran trains until 1993 when the service was taken over by Ferrobaires, a company owned by the Buenos Aires Province.\\"Ferrobaires: La idea que no fue\\" on Portal de Trenes website Ferrobaires operated the standard services between Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires until its closure in 2018.Se oficializ√≥ traspaso de Ferrobaires a Naci√≥n, Infocielo, 26 Jul 2017 In 2009, the bus terminus (that operated in old Mar del Plata Norte station building) moved to a new building, very close to the still active railway station in the centre of the city.

LACMA From Day's book, The Anatomy of Pattern (1887) Lewis Foreman Day (29 January 1845 ‚Äì 18 April 1910) was a British decorative artist and industrial designer and an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement. Life Day was born at Peckham Rye, south London, on 29 January 1845. His father, Samuel, was a wine merchant. His mother was Mary Ann Lewis. He was educated in France, at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and subsequently in Germany. He was first employed as a clerk, then, at the age to twenty he worked for the glass painters and designers Lavers, Barraud and Westlake. He moved to the stained glass makers of Clayton and Bell, where he designed the cartoons. In 1870 he worked for Heaton, Butler and Bayne on the decoration of Eaton Hall, Cheshire. He started his own business in London in 1870, expanding his activities beyond glass painting to a wide range of media including wallpapers for W. B. Simpson & Co., textiles for Turnbull & Stockdale, and tiles for Maw's and Pilkington's. He was an active member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, one time master of the Art Workers Guild, which he helped to found, and a member of the Council of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) for much of the period between 1877 and his death. He was an influential educator and wrote widely on design and pattern. His Cantor Lectures on Ornamental Design for the RSA (1886) led to a series of publications, including The Anatomy of Pattern (1887), The Planning of Ornament (1887), Pattern Design (1903), Ornament and its Application (1904), and Nature and Ornament (1908‚Äì9). He published in many journals, including the Magazine of Art, the Art Journal and the Journal of Decorative Art. Other books were Windows (1897), Stained Glass (1903), Alphabets Old and New (1898) and Lettering in Ornament (1902). He was an examiner for the Department of Science and Art and later the Board of Education. He lectured at the Royal College of Art (RCA). In 1910 he wrote a dissenting report to the government Committee of Inquiry into the RCA, in which he argued for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing Arts and Crafts orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials; in this he shared the Committee of Inquiry's reservations about the methods of the RCA's professor of design, W.

Its core ingredients are hot pastrami, grilled knackwurst, melted Swiss cheese and hot mustard on rye bread. Origins The New York Deli, founded in 1929, claims to be the originator of the sailor sandwich. The eatery moved to its current location in Carytown in 1934. According to local legend, during World War II, Navy seamen from the University of Richmond Navy V-12 program would frequent the New York Deli and order this then-nameless sandwich. It eventually became known as a sailor sandwich, although it is uncertain who officially named the sandwich. Variations The marine sandwich is popular around some Marine bases like MCB Quantico. It is usually served on Italian bread with knackwurst, pastrami or salami and uses German-style mustard and comes with peppers. The West Coast version often includes sliced tomatoes on the side. In popular culture * Patricia Cornwell, whose Kay Scarpetta novels often take place in the Richmond area, included characters ordering and eating sailor sandwiches in Cause of Death and Cruel and Unusual. * In Guy Fieri's book, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives: An All-American Road Trip, the chapter on Virginia features Dot's Back Inn in Richmond as a place to get a sailor sandwich.

He served as Bishop and Apostolic Administrator in the Episcopal Office of Erfurt-Meiningen. Life Early years Aufderbeck was born in Hellefeld, a small village in the heart of the Sauerland countryside, and located some 70 km (45 miles) to the southeast of Dortmund. He attended the local school and then studied Latin for a year with his vicar, Dr. Josef Brill. His early years were spent in a Roman Catholic environment, but he then switched to secondary school, the humanist \\"Laurentian Gymnasium\\" in nearby Arnsberg. He concluded his secondary schooling in Paderborn, where he was able to board at the archbishop's boys' seminary (\\"Seminarium Liborianum\\"). It was in Paderborn, as a pupil at the city's \\"Gymnasium Theodorianum\\" Cathedral School, that on 8 March 1930 he successfully passed his school final exams. Remaining in Paderborn he now entered the episcopate's and studied Theology. This period also included two sabbatical semesters, in 1932/33, in Vienna and Munich. Then, from 1934 till 1936, he attended the Paderborn Catholic Priest Seminary. On 28 March 1936, in the Cathedral, Archbishop Caspar Klein ordained Hugo Aufderbeck into the priesthood. Following his ordination Aufderbeck became a religious teacher in Gelsenkirchen at the Franciscan Sisters' Lyceum. In 1937 he began to study at the University of M√ºnster for a higher level teaching qualification. This was cut short in 1938 when the course was closed under pressure from the government. Aufderbeck now relocated to the eastern part of the large Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn: he became vicar of the provost's parish of Saints Francis and Elizabeth in Halle, also becoming a student chaplain for the city. Wartime In 1940 he took on pastoral responsibilities for soldiers in the Halle region, having already since September 1939 been creating a \\"Soldiers' Circle\\", in which regular soldiers, regardless of rank, met together. Using the military mail service he had built up and sustained a massive correspondence, which by Easter 1945 and the end of the war had involved several thousand soldiers. Mistrusted by the Gestapo, he was subject to house-searches and interrogation sessions, and by the end of the war at constant risk of arrest and punishment. During the war Aufderbeck was in contact with the resistance group around Prof. Theodor Lieser. As the end approached Halle was occupied by US troops on 17 April 1945, and Theodor Lieser was installed by them as the city's Lord Mayor. Although Halle was liberated by Americans, by the time war ended zones of occupation had been agreed which placed Halle in the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany, and in July 1945 the Americans withdrew and were replaced by the Red army. Both under US occupation and under the longer period of Soviet administration which followed, Aufderbeck focused on youth work. He was a member of the \\"Archbishop's Council for Imperiled Youth\\" (\\"Erziehungsbeirats f√ºr gef√§hrdete Jugendliche\\") and of the \\"Advisory Council for Public Youth Support\\". He was the Roman Catholic representative in liaison with the newly formed Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend). The FDJ was the youth wing of the recently renamed and reconstituted ruling party in this part of Germany, which by the later 1940s was in the process of reverting to one-party dictatorship. In 1947 Aufderbeck was appointed by Wilhelm Weskamm, the episcopal commissioner (who later became the Bishop of Berlin) as the permanent representative of the Archbishop's Commission for Youth Work in the Province of Saxony. The context for these developments, and for much of Aufdebeck's subsequent career, was the political frontier which since 1945 had divided the eastern half of the Paderborn archdiocese from Paderborn itself. Although this secular border was initially thoroughly porous, it would become progressively less so after the reinvention, formally in October 1949, of the Soviet occupation zone as the new Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Because of the way in which FDJ activity was ever more overtly blended into the increasingly ubiquitous political activity of the ruling SED (party), Aufderbeck's contacts with the FDJ were fairly soon abandoned. Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic In 1948 Weskamm made Aufderbeck responsible for building up and directing spiritual support on behalf of the Archdiocesan Commission. The political division of Germany was becoming accepted as a permanent aspect of the post-war legacy. Within this political reality Aufderbeck and Weskamm, and then Weskamm's successor created an increasingly separate structure for the eastern part of the Paderborn archdiocese, and in the process constructed an important spiritual and administrative focus for the Roman Catholic church in the German Democratic Republic. Of particular importance are Aufderbeck's efforts regarding liturgical renewal, the \\"priestless\\" offices in remoter areas, with Communion celebrated by members of the laity, and his work at preparing priests and believers for ideological confrontation with Communism. In 1955 he became a member of the Liturgical Commission of the Fulda Bishops' Conference of Pastoral Theologians in the German speaking lands. In 1956, at the invitation of the Trier based German Liturgical Institute, he took part in the first international Pastoral Liturgical Congress, held at Assisi. In 1958 he was appointed a Papal chamberlain and in 1959 a Papal Honorary Prelate. On 19 June 1962 The Pope appointed Aufderbeck Titular bishop of Arca in Phonicia and an Auxiliary bishop with his base in Erfurt. The sudden erection in August 1961 of the Berlin Wall had made it clearer than ever that the eastern part of the Paderborn archdiocese could no longer be administered from Paderborn. Aufderbeck received his episcopal ordination on 5 September 1962 from Archbishop of Berlin (later Cardinal) Alfred Bengsch. Death Aufderbeck became aware of his incurable cancer in 1977. He signed his last will on 15 December 1980. He died on 17 January 1981 in the Erfurt Catholic Hospital.

When founded, the company focused on the legal industry and was named Legal Research Network, before expanding into other fields. The company's founder Dov Seidman, also wrote the book How (2007), about the role of ethics in business. History Founding (1994) Dov Seidman founded Legal Research Network (later changed to \\"LRN\\") two years out of Harvard Law School. Seidman's business plan was to offer legal knowledge and analysis services through an expert network of academics and lawyers.Osborne, D.M. American Lawyer, \\"Should You Be Afraid of this Man?\\" June, 1995 (profile of Legal Research Network) This research could then be repurposed in a database licensed to companies. He was able to pre-sell a $500,000 contract to MCI based on the idea. He raised $2 million from 42 investors to launch the company. In the first year, LRN had a network of 1,100 legal experts in over 2,500 subjects reported by the Washington Post as being \\"mostly law professors, solo practitioners and lawyers on leave from their regular jobs\\". Expansion into Training  The company added ethics and compliance training in the later 1990s as part of an effort to spread legal and ethical awareness throughout organizations, instead of just in their law departments. Online classes, starting in the 2000s, facilitated mass training of thousands of employees at large multi-nationals like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Pfizer trained all 150,000 of its employees with LRN courses. Subjects included complying with sexual harassment laws, trade secrets and anti-trust. By the year 2000, 200 of the Fortune 500 companies were clients of LRN. Starting in the early 2000s, the company offered \\"common standards\\" for ethics and corporate compliance education. Competitors like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer shared as much of 90% of the course materials, helping to standardize best practices for business ethics in corporate America. Seidman testified in 2004 before the U.S. Sentencing Commission, regarding the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, about the need for companies to develop ethical cultures instead of \\"check-the-box\\", compliance-only approaches. Since 2008, LRN has been the corporate partner of The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity‚Äôs Prize in Ethics Essay Contest, an annual competition for students to analyze ethical issues. Operations Services LRN's services include analyzing corporate cultures, rewriting their codes of conduct, and providing ethical-compliance education and training to their employees. LRN emphasizes principles and values rather than \\"blindly\\" following rules. Its online education platform offers about 500 courses in 50 languages, on topics including international corruption law, intellectual property, data protection, and environmental sustainability. LRN ethics training materials include videos, blogs, quizzes, social media and video games. Dell told the Wall Street Journal in 2014 that LRN developed an ethics game for it entitled the \\"Honesty Project.\\" Organization Job titles were largely eliminated from the company, and \\"employee councils\\" handle major functions like recruiting and conflict resolution. LRN was originally headquartered in California and moved its headquarters to New York City in 2012. It also has offices in London and India.

This had the effect of allowing institutions to change their status from colleges to universities in their own right while still remaining part of the University of London.

He published, among other works, the Christian Spectator, Silliman's Journal, and Swift's Digest; and in 1828 Noah Webster's American Dictionary, the first quarto edition in two large volumes, from the original manuscript, and under the supervision of the author. This last was a work of great magnitude, requiring a heavy outlay of means and labor, and making a notable event in the history of the American press. Converse removed to the city of New York in 1828, and was for several years actively engaged in business of various kinds, both in this country and in Canada. About the year 1850 he became crippled by a severe attack of rheumatism, which made him an invalid for the rest of his life, and for ten years before his death he never left his room. Besides suffering from disease, he was sorely tried by grave financial embarrassments, but he bore all his trials with the patience and resignation of a true Christian.

CONADI is overseen by the Social Development Ministry or \\":es:Ministerio de Desarrollo Social de Chile\\". Its headquarters are located in the city of Temuco and it has two subdivisions: Temuco, covering the B√≠o B√≠o, Araucan√≠a, Los Lagos and Los R√≠os regions, and Iquique, covering the Tarapac√°, Antofagasta and Arica y Parinacota regions. Background  CONADI was founded as a result recommendations made by the Special Commission on Indigenous Peoples or \\"Comisi√≥n Especial de Pueblos Ind√≠genas\\" (CEPI) which ran from 1990 to 1995 was created by decree No. 30 of May 27, 1990. As a result of its work, CEPI produced a report with three recommendations: reform the national constitution to include indigenous peoples; ratify the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (ILO Convention No. 169),Convention No. 169 International labour organization www.ilo.org retrieved on June 10, 2015 and create the Indigenous Law that ultimated founded CONADI. The third of these recommendations was approved by the Chilean National Congress and was subsequently promulgated in the Programme for Indigenous Rights (2003). Congress also later ratified ILO Convention No. 169.  Indigenous Law  As part of the initiatives to repair historic damage and encourage the development and social inclusion of indigenous peoples, Chile‚Äôs Indigenous Law was created in the 1990s. Following the return to democracy, Patricio Aylwin's government established the Special Commission of Indigenous People (Comisi√≥n Especial de Pueblos ind√≠genas or CEPI), whose report provided the intellectual framework of the Indigenous Law Ley Ind√≠gena or law n¬∞ 19 253, promulgated on September 28, 1993 by President Aylwin.LEY N¬∫ 19.253 - LEY IND√çGENA The Indigenous Law recognized all indigenous peoples of Chile, in particular the Mapuche people, victims of the Occupation of the Araucan√≠a, as an inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included the Aymara, Atacame√±a, Colla, Quechua, Rapa-Nui, Y√°mana and Kawashkar peoples. Later, in 2006, the Diaguita people were also added to the list. The law established the National Corporation for Indigenous Development (CONADI), which included directly elected indigenous representatives, and advised and directed government programs to assist the economic development of indigenous people. It also gives indigenous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures and traditions and provides for bilingual education (legalizing Mapudungun language) in schools with indigenous populations. Approximately half of the self-identified indigenous population remained separated from the rest of society, largely due to historical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. Both internal factors and governmental policies had previously limited the ability of indigenous people to participate in governmental decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. Indigenous people also experienced some societal discrimination and reported incidents in which they were attacked and harassed. A 2003 Ministry of Planning survey reported that indigenous people earned 26% less than nonindigenous citizens for similar work. Chile is one of the 20 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989.http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 It was adopted in 1989 as the International Labour Organization Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The Supreme Court decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the Pozo Almonte tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marked the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.

The place is named after its main owner, Kh√≥o Ts√∫-song (1874-1945), a Taiwanese notable who has been in charge of Keelung city as well as Taipei province during the Japanese period. Kh√≥o Ts√∫-song (Ë®±Ê¢ìÊ°ë) is his name pronounced in Hokkien, his mother tongue, but he is more well-known today as Hsu Tsu-sun, which is the same name with a pronunciation in Mandarin. Adding to his political responsibilities, he was also a well-known personality in artistic circles, especially connected with poets from all over the country. His house has been built in 1931. Located very close to what is today the famous Keelung night market, the only streets to reach the house are narrow walking passage transforming into stairways that finally lead to the house, on the top of a hill, with a peculiar view on the rooftops of Keelung city. Recognized as a historical building since 2001, the place which is partially privately owned, does not benefit from the protection guaranteed by the status of the Historical Site. Currently, the place has been abandoned by its previous owners and has no inhabitants since more than 30 years. Due to disrepair and weathering, the house is now a ruin, and the second floor has no roof anymore. Most of the red brick walls and the windows are still there. The house is made of several architectural influences. The massive red brick walls remind the fortifications and official buildings erected by Dutch and Spanish colonizers in Damshui and Tainan. The two floors structure could be from the same European style influence, as for the symmetrical two sides stairway leading to the second floor. But once we are on the second floor, the style and the disposition of the rooms, as for the central square are all very typical of the Fukien architecture that we still find all around Taiwan. In July 2014, an organization called the Keelung Youth Front started to clean the Kh√≥o Ts√∫-song old house in order to allow the public to be able to visit this architectural patrimony of Keelung city.

It has been a source of wealth as an economic and versatile building material since ancient Roman times (see Mines of Paris) and has contributed markedly to the unique visual appeal of the ‚ÄúCity of Light‚Äù. (It has been hailed as ‚Äúthe warm, elusive, cream-grey stone of the French capital‚Äù.Lichfield, John (2007), ‚ÄúThe Stones of Paris‚Äù, The Independent, (22 Sept issue).) Its formation dates to the Eocene epoch's Lutetian age (between ). The name \\"Lutetian\\" derives from Lutetia (French, Lut√®ce) which was the city's name in ancient times. History Between the 17th and 19th centuries, Lutetian limestone was extracted by tunneling through hill-sides south of Paris. The stone comprises many of the grandest Paris buildings from the 17th century onwards, including parts of the Louvre, the Place de la Concorde and Les Invalides. Haussmann's grand renovation of Paris (1853-1870), which provided a sweeping and uniform style and an elusive coloring ‚Äî ranging from bright white to butter-yellow to a dull nicotine-yellow/grey ‚Äî for the city, relied upon buildings faced with Lutetian limestone. In the 20th century, open-cast quarries were developed which uncovered thinner layers of harder limestone closer to the surface north of Paris. A now fashionable variety of Lutetian limestone from about 25 miles north of Paris is known as ‚ÄúOise stone‚Äù or \\"Saint-Maximin limestone\\" and has become popular internationally for upscale building projects. In 2007, the quarries in southern Oise, around Saint-Maximin and Chantilly, applied to the French government to become the first to be granted a building stone Appellation Contr√¥l√©e ‚Äì the badge of official French regional excellence ‚Äì as if it were a wine or a cheese. According to a 2007 article in the UK's The Independent: ‚ÄúThe harder, sliceable limestone sells for around ‚Ç¨2,000 a cubic metre.

Overview  An Œ±-ketoacid at the C-terminus of one peptide fragment reacts with a hydroxylamine at the N-terminus of another to form a peptide bond (amide bond). The reaction can happen in the presence of unprotected side chains, and it does not require any coupling reagents or catalysts. The only byproducts are water and CO2.Type I KAHA Ligation (unmodified hydroxy group) Type II KAHA Ligation (O-substituted hydroxylamine) The first reported protein synthesized by KAHA ligation was human GLP-1 (7-36). Since then, a variety of small proteins (up to 200 residues) have been synthesized, including ubiquitin and other similar modifier proteins, hormone proteins, nitrophorin 4, S100A4 and cyclic proteins. C-terminal ketoacid monomers are pre-loaded on resin via a linker for Fmoc-SPPS (Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis). Initial research utilised sulfur ylide linkers, but more recently the group developed acid- and photo-labile ketoacid monomers that can be loaded directly on Rink Amide resin. The most commonly used N-terminal hydroxylamine is the 5-oxaproline, which results in a homoserine residue after ligation and O-N rearrangement.

This festival occurs once every 144 years, corresponding to the 12th recurrence of the 12-year Godavari Pushkaram cycle. The festival starts from the Ashadha (June/July) month on the Chaturdashi day (thithi) (14th day), when planet Jupiter enters the zodiac sign of Leo. The festival is \\"theoretically\\" observed throughout the twelve months that the planet remains in that sign, but the first 12 days are considered most sacred. The first 12 days of the Godavari Pushkaram are known as \\"Aadhi Pushkaram\\" and the last 12 days are titled \\"Anthya Pushkaralu\\". The next Maha Pushkaram will be celebrated in 2159. At least 27 pilgrims, 13 of them women, died and 20 others injured in a stampede at a major bathing spot on the banks of the Godavari river where a huge crowd of devotees had gathered on the opening day of 'Pushkaram' festival.http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-07-14/news/64405897_1_holy- dip-godavari-river-pushkaram Etymology \\"Maha\\" means \\"great\\" and Pushkaram refers to the worship of the river in which the god Pushkar appears every 12 years. Pushakaram is spelled Pushkaralu in Telugu, Pushkaram in Tamil, Pushkara in Kannada, and Pushkar in Hindi. Background Pushkaram is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of 12 sacred rivers. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Bruhaspathi (Jupiter) is in at the time. It is believed that bathing in the sacred river during Pushkaram cleanses the devotees of their sins. Godavari is one of the 12 sacred rivers, and the Godavari Pushkaram takes place once every 12 years, when the Jupiter is in the Leo sign. The Maha Pushkaram (\\"Great Pushkaram\\") takes place once every 144 years. Festival dates The 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is believed to be a Maha Pushkaram, which happens once in 144 years. During the year 2015, Jupiter enters Leo on 14 July 2015 (Tuesday) at 6.26 AM, when the Maha Pushkaram begins, and ends after 12 days on 25 July 2015 (Saturday). Multiple almanac writers and other skeptics have disputed that the 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is a \\"Maha Pushkaram\\". According to Hanmanthavajjula Subrahmanya Sarma, the president of State Drukghanitha Almanac Writers‚Äô Association, the \\"theory of 144 years is a myth\\", and nobody knows \\"who calculated it and how they calculated it\\". Details of locations The places on the banks of the Godavari River where pilgrims visit famous temples are in the five districts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The notable places are Manthani, Basar, Dharmapuri, Koti Lingala, Kaleshwaram, Bhadrachalam in Telangana and Rajahmundry, Kovvur, Narasapuram, Antervedi in Andhra Pradesh. Facilities The Maha Pushkaram festival in 2015 attracted 48.1 million people in Andhra Pradesh and 57 million people in the Telangana state link from all parts of India. On this occasion, it is essential to take a holy dip in the Godavari River to get the supposed benefits of better physical and mental abilities. The Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have made all arrangements for this event in their respective states by constructing ghats for bathing and improving road communications, basic amenities of water supply and sanitation, and security. In Andhra Pradesh. the budget allocated for improvement of infrastructure facilities is INR 1,295 crores. Symbolism Stage of Godavari Harathi in Rajamundry Devotees taking a holy dip at Bhadrachalam during Maha Pushkaram in 2015 An emblem titled \\"Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015\\" and \\"Godavari Pushkaramalu\\" has been adopted by the state governments for this festival, and a special organization under the same name has also been instituted to address all issues related to the smooth functioning of the festive event. The emblem or logo with a simple design has lines to denote the rapid flow conditions of the Godavari River, a \\"jyoti\\" a glowing light, and the representation of offering oblation, called \\"Arghyam\\", to Surya, the Sun god. Another symbolic event proposed during the festival is to hold \\"Sobha Yatra\\", a procession carrying the sacred waters of the Godavari River to be mixed with water bodies in all the villages in the 13 districts which lie within the ambit of the Godavari River. A religious symbolic performance called the \\"Godavari Harathi\\", a ritual of worship with a number of lamps, similar to the Ganga Aarti that is conducted on the banks of the Ganges in Varanasi, is also proposed to be held at Rajahmundry where the river flows out to the sea.

Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (1957), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that involuntary blood samples, taken by a skilled technician to determine intoxication, do not violate substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432, 433-34, 437, 439 (1957). This case was only the second time the Court considered whether police could forcibly enter inside a suspect's body to extract evidence.Blake A. Bailey, et al., Criminal Law - Lee v. Winston: Court-Ordered Surgery and the Fourth Amendment - A New Analysis of Reasonableness?, 60 149 (1984). Writing for a 6‚Äì3 majority, Justice Tom C. Clark argued that blood tests were necessary as a matter of public policy to ensure traffic safety on roads and highways, and that \\"modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 439. Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas both wrote dissenting opinions in which they argued that the involuntary blood sample taken in this case was \\"repulsive\\" and violated substantive due process.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 440 (Warren, C.J., dissenting); Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 444 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Background The constitutionality of searches inside the body In the 1950s the Supreme Court of the United States addressed for the first time whether the constitution permits law enforcement to forcibly extract evidence from inside the human body. The first case to address this question, Rochin v. California, set strict limits on the power of police to remove evidence from inside the human body.Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172-73 (1952). In Rochin, police officers broke into the home of an individual who was suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small capsules into his mouth.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 166; see also Brief for Petitioner, Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (U.S., 1952). After a brief struggle, officers attempted to force open the suspect's mouth, but were unable to retrieve the capsules.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 166 (\\"the three officers ‚Äòjumped upon him‚Äô and attempted to extract the capsules\\"). Officers then handcuffed the suspect and transported him to a local hospital, where \\"a doctor forced an emetic solution through a tube into Rochin's stomach against his will.\\"Rochin, 342 U.S. at 166. Through this stomach pumping, officers discovered two capsules containing morphine.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 166; Brief for Petitioner, Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (U.S., 1952) (\\"the officer deduced they contained narcotics because there would be a strong suspicion on his part that they did contain narcotics\\"). In a unanimous decision, the United States Supreme Court held the forced stomach pumping violated the suspect's Fourteenth Amendment rights to substantive due process.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172-73. Writing for the majority, Justice Felix Frankfurter stated: Although the Court held that evidence obtained in violation of substantive due process must be excluded in criminal prosecutions, the court declined to incorporate a broad exclusionary rule for all constitutional violations.E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503, 510 (1996) (\\"[The] Rochin decision applied the exclusionary rule to state courts for the first time, but only where conscience-shocking due process issues were present.\\"). Likewise, the Court left unanswered the question of whether evidence obtained through involuntary blood samples violates the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self incrimination.See Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 765 (1966). Arrest and prosecution of Paul Breithaupt In 1951, a truck driven by Paul Breithaupt collided with another vehicle while driving on a highway near Carlsbad, New Mexico.Brief for Petitioner, Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (U.S., 1957); see also , Breithaupt v. Abram. Three passengers in Breithaupt's truck were killed, and Breithaupt was taken to a local hospital to treat serious injuries.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433; Brief for Petitioner, Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (U.S., 1957). Responding officers found a nearly empty one-pint bottle of whiskey in the truck's glove compartment.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433. While Breithaupt lay unconscious in the emergency room, officers ordered physicians to take a sample of his blood.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433; Brief for Petitioner, Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (U.S., 1957). A chemical analysis of this blood sample determined that Breithaupt was under the influence of alcohol when the sample was taken.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433 (\\"laboratory analysis showed this blood to contain about .17% alcohol\\"); Brief for Petitioner, Breithaupt v. Abram, 352 U.S. 432 (U.S., 1957). This blood sample was admitted into evidence at trial, and Breithaupt was ultimately convicted of involuntary manslaughter.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433. Breithaupt filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, but the state supreme court denied relief.Breithaupt v. Abram, 58 N.M. 385 (1954). He then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming the taking of the blood sample violated his rights to substantive due process.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 434 (\\"Petitioner contends that his conviction, based on the result of the involuntary blood test, deprived him of his liberty without that due process of law guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\\"). On April 23, 1956, the Supreme Court granted Breithaupt's petition for certiorari.Breithaupt v. Abram, 351 U.S. 906 (1956). Opinion of the Court Writing for the Court's majority, Justice Tom C. Clark distinguished the facts of this case from the events that occurred in Rochin v. California.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 435. Because the blood sample in this case was taken \\"under the protective eye of a physician,\\" there was nothing \\"brutal\\" or \\"offensive\\" about the extraction.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 435-36 (\\"certainly the test as administered here would not be considered offensive by even the most delicate\\"). Additionally, Justice Clark concluded that the absence of conscious consent \\"does not necessarily render the taking a violation of a constitutional right.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 435. Rather, courts should look to community standards of fairness and decency when evaluating constitutional violations: Because blood tests were \\"routine in our everyday life,\\" Justice Clark argued that \\"a blood test taken by a skilled technician\\" does not \\"shock the conscience\\" or offend an ordinary \\"sense of justice.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 436-37. However, Justice Clark also cautioned in dicta that \\"indiscriminate taking of blood under different conditions or by those not competent to do so\\" may rise to the level of \\"brutality\\" set forth in Rochin.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 437-38. If law enforcement and physicians do not provide \\"every proper medical precaution\\" to the accused, the extraction may violate the constitution.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 438. Additionally, as a matter of public policy, Justice Clark argued that \\"modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection\\" and blood tests were necessary to keep the roads safe.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 439. Justice Clark also declined to incorporate the Fourth Amendment protection against warrantless searches or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination to the states.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 434. Chief Justice Warren's dissenting opinion In his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas argued for an expansive interpretation of the right against self incrimination, and that \\"under our system of government, police cannot compel people to furnish the evidence necessary to send them to prison.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 443 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the facts of this case were analogous to those in Rochin, and that the blood test in this case violated Breithaupt's rights to substantive due process.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 440 (Warren, C.J., dissenting) (\\"I cannot agree with the Court when it says, ‚Äòwe see nothing comparable here to the facts in Rochin.‚Äô\\"). He criticized Justice Clark's majority opinion for relying on policy arguments about highway safety to distinguish Rochin, and that narcotics enforcement \\"is surely a state interest of at least as great magnitude as the interest in highway law enforcement.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 440 (Warren, C.J., dissenting). Chief Justice Warren also criticized Justice Clark's reliance on common standards of decency and the commonplace nature of blood tests, and instead urged the Court to hold that \\"bruishing the body, breaking skin, puncturing tissue or extracting body fluids\\" always constitute a due process violation when police collect evidence.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 442 (Warren, C.J., dissenting). Justice Douglas' dissenting opinion Justice William O. Douglas also wrote a dissenting opinion in which he noted that the court had set aside convictions in the past when the police engaged in subtle, non-violent manipulation,See Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556 (1954). and that the Court should \\"take the same libertarian approach here.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 443 (Douglas, J., dissenting). He also agreed that this case was indistinguishable from Rochin and it was \\"repulsive\\" for officers to stick a needle in the arm of an unconscious person.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 444 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice Douglas also advocated for an expansive interpretation of the right against self incrimination, and that \\"under our system of government, police cannot compel people to furnish the evidence necessary to send them to prison.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 443 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Subsequent developments Although the Court declined to incorporate the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule or the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self incrimination in Breithaupt, the Court ultimately incorporated both of these rights to the states in 1964 and 1965.See Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964). Nine years after Breithaupt, the Court granted review in Schmerber v. California to clarify whether admitting involuntary blood samples into evidence in a criminal prosecution violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.Schmerber v. California, 382 U.S. 971 (1966). In a 5-4 opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. held that blood samples do not implicate the right against self incrimination because the extraction and chemical analysis of blood samples do not involve \\"even a shadow of testimonial compulsion.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 765. However, Justice Brennan also ruled that ordinarily, search warrants are required \\"where intrusions into the human body are concerned.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770. In 1985, the Supreme Court again revisited the topic of involuntary bodily intrusions in Winston v. Lee, when the Court held that the State of Virginia could not force an individual to undergo surgery to extract a bullet that may be evidence of a crime.Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 767 (1985). The Court did not explicitly evaluate whether the surgery would violate substantive due process, but the Court applied Schmerber to conclude that the surgery would constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.Winston, 470 U.S. at 762-63.

Over time, his company grew to become a large international concern; by 1988 it had a turnover of ¬£25 million and exported 15 per cent of production outside the UK. During his organisation's 1980s heyday, Rogers was described by Judy Rumbold in The Guardian as \\"the T-shirt king\\", although his company was almost as ubiquitous for its knitwear, supplied to retailers such as TopShop, Miss Selfridge and John Lewis. Fashion journalist Brenda Polan described Rogers as: \\"one of Britain's most successful manufacturers of mass-market fashion, supplier to most of the zippy low-cost chains\\". Early career Jeffrey Rogers began his career as a lift boy in Owen Owen's Finchley store. He then moved on to the role of floor sweeper in a coat factory. His first move into fashion proper was working for the brand Jump, owned by Louis Caring. He established his own company, Jeffrey Rogers, in a Soho basement in 1974, initially with a team of three people. 1980s expansion The Jeffrey Rogers brand specialised in producing mass-market products for distribution to major high-street chain stores. Prices were competitive and by 1985, the company had a workforce of 350. Rogers told an interviewer in 1988 that his brand was producing 25 million T-shirts a year. His was the brand that created a ubiquitous RELAX T-shirt design in 1984 worn by Frankie Goes to Hollywood fans; as Judy Rumbold noted in a 1988 interview: \\"Which came first, the record or the t-shirt? Rogers is studiedly vague\\". Rogers' specialism was producing garments that were on trend for high-street shoppers, as he said: \\"There are five or six garments that everyone wants each season and we've got to make sure we make at least three or four of them\\". Collaborations In the early 1980s, Rogers had six different labels within the Jeffrey Rogers group. He began more high-fashion and upmarket collaborations, working first with two former Royal College of Art students Meghumi Ohki and Barbara Kennington on the Lumiere brand they had launched in 1977; they had the design background but wanted his input into the business side. In 1983, he collaborated with Sheilagh Brown, a high-fashion designer who had formerly worked with Stirling Cooper and Sheridan Barnett among others, and was then principal lecturer in fashion at Central Saint Martins. Initially the idea was to give her students the opportunity to design garments for commercial production. This, as described by Rogers, was an abysmal failure, but he liked working with Brown and invited her to design for him. Brown's own label designs proved so successful that she began designing for Jeffrey Rogers' more upmarket Portrait label as well. Later in the 1980s, Rogers collaborated with Sandra Proctor, a former buyer at Miss Selfridge, to create the Easy Pieces label ‚Äì designed as a competitor to brands such as French Connection and with a focus on knitwear. Later career Over time Jeffrey Rogers' business grew into a large wholesale and retail operation. After difficult trading conditions at the start of the 1990s, he decided to build a retail business under the eponymous brand name. By 1994, there were 39 stores and the company was planning expansion into mainland Europe. The company went into administration in 2001, by which stage it traded as both the Jeffrey Rogers and Rogers + Rogers brands and had some 600 employees and over 50 stores, including three overseas franchises. Inventory problems and high retail rental prices were cited as the causes of its difficulties. Rogers was the main shareholder. By 2002 Jeffrey Rogers the brand was part of the Matalan stable. Jeffrey Rogers has continued to work in fashion design, establishing the Jeffrey & Paula label with his wife and working with retail operations such as Simply Be.

Early life  Allan was born at Christ's Hospital independent school, Horsham, Sussex, where his father, G.A.T. Allan, was clerk to the school. He was educated at St Paul's School, London. At the age of 15, he had a leg amputated following an accident during Officers' Training Corps exercises. His hopes of joining the Southern Railway as a cadet were dashed as result of his failure to pass the school certificate examination. He was nevertheless offered a position in the Southern Railway's Public Relations Office at by Sir John Elliot. After the outbreak of World War II, he was exempt from military service due to the loss of his leg. He stayed at the Southern Railway handling public enquiries including ones from railway enthusiasts and producing the company's magazine. Publishing career ABC guides With the help of S.K. Packham, Chief Clerk in the Public Relations Office, Allan compiled a notebook with all the names, numbers, classes and shed allocations of Southern Railway locomotives, based on many of the requests he received about rolling stock. This was so well-received that Allan asked his chief officer, Cuthbert Grasemann, if he might publish it as a small booklet which would save costs in terms of replying to public enquiries and which could even make a small profit. The proposal was turned down but Allan was allowed to begin publication on his own behalf. Through the Public Relations Office, he met W.C. Brett of McCorquodale & Co. printers who agreed to publish the booklet. Two thousand copies of his first book, ABC of Southern Locomotives, were ordered for sale for a shilling each. On the day of its publication, 21 November 1942, Allan presented copies to Grasemann and Oliver Bulleid, the Southern Railway's Chief Mechanical Engineer. This backfired as Bulleid objected violently to the publication of a book about his locomotives without his knowledge and he threatened Allan with dismissal from the Southern Railway as well as an action for breach of copyright if he were to publish. Undeterred, Allan went ahead with publication and sent a copy to Robert Holland-Martin, Chairman of the Southern Railway, who welcomed it and congratulated Allan on his entrepreneurial spirit. No further objection was raised to Allan's continued employment with the Southern, although he was barred from the Locomotive Drawing Office and informed that communications with the Locomotive Department had to be sent through official channels. The first edition was quickly sold out and enlarged editions followed with photographs provided by O.J. Morris, who had been a frequent contributor to the Southern Railway magazine. The ABC of Great Western Locomotives was published in 1943, followed by the ABC of London Midland & Scottish Locomotives, and the ABC of LNER Locomotives. The 20,000 copies of the first edition of an ABC guide covering London Transport railways, trams, buses, trolleybuses and coaches sold out in a few days despite the poor quality paper used. Allan's guides proved to be a success, leading to the emerging of trainspotting as a national hobby. With Mollie Franklin (later his wife) he formed the Ian Allan Locospotters‚Äô Club in 1949, which eventually grew to some 230,000 members. Ian Allan Publishing With the success of the ABC guides, Allan was having to divide his time between Staines, where the publishing office was based at his parents' home, Waterloo and where some of the Southern Railway's offices had been relocated. This demanding schedule led Allan to resign from the Southern Railway in 1945 to set up his own publishing company, Ian Allan Ltd. One of the first directors of the company was Cecil J. Allen, the best-known railway writer at that time, who had agreed to author Ian Allan's first book, Titled Trains of Great Britain. In 1946, Allen's son, Geoffrey Freeman Allen, joined the staff and was later to become Joint Managing Director. In 1946, Allan founded Trains Illustrated magazine, which became Modern Railways in 1962. Buses Illustrated was introduced in 1949 as well as the Railway Modeller. In 1950, the company moved to larger premises on Hampton Court Road. In 1957, the Locomotive Publishing Company was acquired and its collection of 25,000 glass negatives became part of the Ian Allan collection. In addition, its publication the Locomotive was incorporated into Trains Illustrated. Ian Allan Publishing reflected Allan's main hobbies. In addition to railway publishing, the company covered an extensive catalogue of Masonic publications. From the 1990s the Masonic titles were transferred to Ian Allan Publishing's dedicated subsidiary imprint Lewis Masonic. Freemasonry Ian Allan was a highly active Freemason, initiated in October 1955 in the Ashford Manor Lodge No 5045 at Staines. Later he also joined the Albert Duke of York Lodge No 4970 (also in Middlesex), and the Christ's Hospital Lodge No 2650 in London. He held senior rank in the masonic Province of Middlesex, and he was also appointed to office in the United Grand Lodge of England, serving as a Past Assistant Grand Director of Ceremonies from 1982 to 1992, and as a Past Junior Grand Deacon from 1992 until his death. Other activities Allan bought the Hastings Miniature Railway in 1948, and the Great Cockcrow Railway near Chertsey in 1960. He also led a successful campaign to reinstate steam-hauled excursions using privately owned locomotives, after the end of steam on British Rail. He was active in railway preservation and sat on various railway trusts. He was chairman of the Association of Independent Railways, and in the early 1980s was a member of the Transport Users‚Äô Consultative Committee for London. He served as a governor of several schools. His recreations are listed in Who's Who as \\"swimming, touring, miniature railways, Freemasonry\\".Who's Who 2013, page 29 He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1995. Family Allan married Mollie Eileen Franklin in 1947. He was survived by her and their two sons. Death Allan died on 28 June 2015, one day short of his 93rd birthday.

Anchorite on the Steps of the Temple Later, he attended the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy then, in 1889, began auditing classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where his teachers included Ivan Shishkin and Arkhip Kuindzhi, with whom he became a lifelong friend. He graduated in 1897 and was able to travel with a group of Kuindzhi's students to Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and Paris. In 1902, against her father's wishes, he married Olga Khitrova, a young woman from an old noble family who was only seventeen.Biography and appreciation @ Crimean artists on Perekop, by Yulia Samarina. Two years later, he made his first trip to Greece and stayed for a year. He taught painting at the \\"Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts\\" from 1897 until 1919. From 1900, he was the Inspector there, and became a full member in 1909, the year that he helped create the \\"Kuindzhi Artists' Society\\". In 1916, he was named an Academician.Brief biography @ \\"Greeks from Ukraine\\". Leaving Russia In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, Olga was denounced and arrested by the new government for transferring messages written by political prisoners. His attempts to free her failed, and only served to make his situation dangerous, so he sought refuge with relatives in Crimea and, when the opportunity arose, emigrated to Greece. After arriving, he spent several years travelling throughout the Peloponnese, Crete, and the islands on the west coast, painting landscapes and architectural sites. Eventually, due to her father's influence, Olga was freed and, with some searching, was able to rejoin him. After that, she essentially became his manager. In 1929, they settled on Skyros, where he became ill with malaria and died as a result of an incorrect diagnosis and improper treatment. Later that year, Olga presented a major retrospective of his works in Athens and, the following year, in London.

The sale‚Äôs profits ($265 million) were used to fund two organizations focused on improving health in Kansas:\\"Trustees approve Wesley sale\\", Salina Journal, February 6, 1985, p.7 * United Methodist Health Ministry Fund\\"History\\", official website of the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and * Wesley Medical Endowment Foundation ‚Äî which became the Kansas Health Foundation (KHF).

The KHF has partnered with over 40 other Kansas community foundations, organizations and programs, largely to help fund and promote health and wellness improvement efforts throughout the state. In 1997, the KHF focused more specifically on children's health.

Smoking and Tobacco Use Tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking) is Kansas' top cause of preventable death and disease, with one of every five Kansas adults smoking cigarettes. However, the KHF largely blames this on decisions by Kansas legislators and governors to underfund tobacco prevention, making Kansas (in 2013) 41st in the nation for per-capita spending on tobacco prevention. In 2013, the federal government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that states spend $32.1 million annually on tobacco prevention, but Kansas was only funding such programs at $946,671 per year ‚Äî desipite collecting a combined $154.3 million in 2013 from the settlement and tobacco taxes. Critics cite Kansas politicians' decisions to divert the state's share of the tobacco lawsuit settlement away from tobacco- use prevention and mitigation ‚Äî towards completely unrelated activity, particularly to plug shortfalls in the state budget and facilitate tax cuts.Bruce, Giles, Anti-tobacco advocates say Kansas has underfunded smoking prevention, December 9, 2013, Lawrence Journal-World Kansas Department of Health and Education former spokeswoman Miranda Steele has countered that the state's high-school smoking rate (at 14%, below the nationwide average of 18%) is below the smoking rates of neighboring states, including some which spend more, per person, on tobacco prevention.

Her memoirs, Reminiscences of Marianne-Caroline Hamilton (1777‚Äì1861), were published in 2010. Early life and family Marianne- Caroline Hamilton was born in 1777 at Rossana, County Wicklow. She was the second daughter of landowner and MP for Athboy, William Tighe, and Sarah (n√©e Fownes). William Tighe was a friend of John Wesley who used Rossana as his base from which to preach in Ireland. Sarah Tighe was the heir of Sir William Fownes, and Lady Elizabeth Fownes (n√©e Ponsonby). Hamilton spent a great deal of her youth at Harrow, England, where her younger brother was attending boarding school, and in London. The family holidayed in Ireland, which she preferred due to the space and freedom she had there. Hamilton received a comprehensive education from a number of governesses, a master for arithmetic, and her brother's tutor providing Latin tuition. Her main interest was art however, later confessing to avoiding Latin classes to draw. She travelled with her family, spending time in France, Flanders, and Holland, with the family returning to live in Ireland in 1795. John Inigo Spilsbury was employed as her drawing master, during which time she reached the skill level of a professional artist. She married Charles Hamilton, of Hamwood House, Dunboyne, County Meath in April 1801. Charles was a land agent for the Dukes of Leinster. The couple had six children, Sarah, Caroline Elizabeth, Mary, Charles William, William Tighe, and Frederick John Henry Fownes. Hamilton educated her children herself, which left little time to paint. From her writings it is evident she was deeply involved in the running of Hamwood and its gardens. Literary work Hamilton transcribed a number of albums of poetry, with contributions from Thomas Moore and Hamilton's cousin and sister- in-law Mary Tighe. Thomas Campbell wrote a poem in tribute to her, The stanzas on painting. She wrote a history of her family, detailing the lives of Theodosia and Mary Blachford, and Sarah Ponsonby. Ponsonby bequeathed all of her private papers to Hamilton. Memoir and legacy Hamilton wrote in a satirical style, providing a critical depiction of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy from that period. Her best known works include Domestic happiness as acted in the city: a tragic comic farce, The Kingston to Holyhead packet, and Society. Her family memoir was purchased by the National Library of Ireland from the estate of her descendant William Howard in the 1970s. The memoir was published in 2010 as the edited volume Reminiscences of Marianne-Caroline Hamilton (1777‚Äì1861). Hamilton died at her Dublin home, 40 Dominick Street, on 29 July 1861. Some of her drawings at still kept at Hamwood. Desmond Fitzgerald and Professor Anne Crookshank used Hamilton's drawings in books covering the history of art in Ireland. Her great-granddaughter was artist Letitia Marion Hamilton.

As a professional wrestling championship, it was won via a planned ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. All title changes occurred at TNA-promoted events.

In the weeks leading up to the unveiling of the physical belt, Booker T carried around a steel briefcase. On the October 23, 2008, episode of Impact!, Booker T introduced the belt by removing it from the briefcase, announcing its name as the \\"TNA Legends Championship\\", and declaring himself the first champion.

Afterwards on the March 19, 2009, episode of Impact!, Styles was credited as becoming the first-ever TNA Grand Slam Champion, by winning the World Heavyweight (NWA or TNA), the World Tag Team (NWA or TNA), the TNA X Division Championship, and the Legends Championship. TNA Management Director Jim Cornette then announced that the TNA Legends Championship had become an official TNA sanctioned championship thanks to Styles defeating Booker T for it legally via the contract the two had signed to make the match official. On the October 29, 2009, episode of Impact!, then-champion Eric Young renamed the title the \\"TNA Global Championship\\". He went on to declare that he was not going to defend it against any American wrestlers nor on American soil. However, Young's first defense was on the December 10, 2009, episode of Impact! in Orlando, Florida against Japanese female wrestler Hamada. Young's second, third and fourth defenses lived up to his earlier decree, when he defended against Suicide in Glasgow, Hamada in Bournemouth, and unsuccessfully against Welsh wrestler Rob Terry in Cardiff, Wales at a live event on January 27, 2010. On the July 22, 2010, episode of Impact!, Terry lost the Global Championship to A.J. Styles. Styles then renamed the title the \\"TNA Television Championship\\" on the July 29, 2010, episode of Impact!. On the April 19, 2012, episode of the newly titled Impact Wrestling, TNA General Manager Hulk Hogan ordered that the TNA Television Championship had to be defended every week. The weekly title defenses lasted until the June 21, 2012, episode of Impact Wrestling. Abyss was the longest reigning champion On July 3, 2014, TNA Executive Director Kurt Angle declared the championship inactive. The title was reactivated on June 25, 2015, by TNA under the new name of the \\"TNA King of the Mountain Championship.\\" TNA announced that a new champion would be determined in a King of the Mountain match at their Slammiversary PPV event on June 28. Jeff Jarrett defeated Matt Hardy, Eric Young, Drew Galloway, and Bobby Roode to win the championship. The title ended up appearing in GFW at a July 9 live event where Young attacked Jarrett and stole the championship belt. During the August 18, 2016, taping of Impact Wrestling, it was announced that the King of the Mountain Championship was vacated, deactivated and retired with announcement of a new title, the Impact Grand Championship. Reigns The inaugural champion was Booker T, who awarded the championship to himself on the October 23, 2008, episode of Impact!. Eric Young holds the record for most reigns, with three, and is the only wrestler to hold the title under all four of its incarnations. Abyss' second reign is the longest in the title's history at 396 days. PJ Black and Lashley share the record for shortest reign in the title's history at one day. Abyss holds the record for combined days as champion, with 460. Lashley was the final champion, having defeated James Storm for the championship with his X Division and World Heavyweight Championships on the line, and unifying the title with his World Title, thus retiring the King of the Mountain Championship in the process. Overall, there have been 25 reigns shared among 19 wrestlers, with three vacancies and two deactivations.

Gunn written in 1934. Based on a semi-fictionalised account of the Highland Clearances in Sutherland, the novel deals with the decline of Highland culture in a wide scope of pre-Clearance and post-Clearance life, as well as the Clearances themselves. Plot The book opens on Dark Mairi, a local healer and widow making her way back to the Strath where she, her grandson Davie and Elie (a young woman from the community) live. They live on the Riasgan estate where they have lived for many years under the ancient clan system. The decline of the clan system is one of the catalysts that drives the Clearances and the plot of the novel. Elie falls in love with Colin, a young man in the community and falls pregnant to him, just as he leaves to go to fight in the Napoleonic Wars for regiment raised by the local Captain, who as tacksman emigrates, leaving his community lacking the protection he once provided. Elie wanders the Lowlands destitute with her child but returns to the community an outcast just as the threat of clearance hangs over the whole Strath (this is carried out by a thinly veiled equivalent of Patrick Sellar called Heller). Through this all Young Davie struggles to regain his trust for Elie, and Elie also attracts the attentions of Rob the Miller, who eventually marries her. The community is burned out and cleared to the rocky shore, with a wall erected to stop them using their old lands. They eke out a pitiful existence in a harsh environment. Mairi is killed at the end by an estate sheepdog. Colin returns from the war to find his community relocated and overtly changed. He encounters he and Elie's son Colin, and together, although not recognising each other as father and son they bury Mairi according to custom. Significance Butcher's Broom was one of the first pieces of 20th Century fiction to deal with the Highland Clearances. It deals with the social unrest which came with the decline of the Highland Clan System as chiefs became anglicised, the tacksmen emigrated and attitudes of laissez-faire capitalism and a belief in the inferiority of Gaelic culture arose to prominence in the 1800s. Whilst Riasgan is a fictional location, the Clearances are very similar to those carried out in Strathnaver and Strath Kildonan, including the death of 93 year old Margaret MacKay, allegedly through the neglect by Patrick Sellar and his men. It is Gunn's only book which directly deals with the Clearances, although many of his works are written in the historic aftermath of the events. When asked why he never wrote more than one novel about the Clearances itself, he referenced the complicity of Lowland Scots and the Highland Gentry in the process saying it was due \\"To the shame of the thing.. because our own people did it.\\" References External links *A Celebration of the Light with analysis of Butcher's Broom *review Scottish books Highland Clearances ","title":"Butcher's Broom (novel)"},{"id":"47112501","text":"Tofta, also known as Gotlands Tofta, is a populated area, a socken (not to be confused with parish), on the Swedish island of Gotland.The exact extent of the socken, now district, can be obtained by clicking on Kartinst√§llningar and check the Socken box in the menu of this map from the Swedish National Heritage Board database. It comprises the same area as the administrative Tofta District, established on 1January 2016. Tofta is most noted for its long, sandy beach. In the north part of Tofta is a military firing range, which is also the location of the annual Gotland Grand National, the world's largest enduro race.  Geography  Tofta is the name of the socken as well as the district. It is also the name of the small village surrounding the medieval Tofta Church, also known as Tofta kyrkby. Tofta is on the central west coast of Gotland, situated on a high rocky plateau mostly covered in pine forest, 48%, while 22% of the area is used as farmland. In the northwest part of Tofta, between the coastline and road 140, is the Tofta firing range (Tofta Skjutf√§lt). It is a military compound, approximately , used for training with live ammunition, tanks, artillery and land mines. Once a year, the Gotland Grand National, the world's largest enduro race, is held on the range. On the Tofta coast are two old fishing villages; Bl√•h√§ll to the north and Gnisv√§rd a bit further south. Bl√•h√§ll has several caves and Gnisv√§rd has some of the grandest stone ships on Gotland. Inland is the Sm√•g√•rde village. Tofta is most noted for the long sandy beach along the southern coastline. It is the second largest and most visited, on Gotland after the Sudersand beach on F√•r√∂. , Tofta Church belongs to Eskelhem-Tofta parish in Eskelhems pastorat, along with the churches in Eskelhem and Gnisv√§rd. One of the asteroids in the asteroid belt, 11308 Tofta, is named after this place.  History  The village of Tofta dates from Medieval times. The oldest preserved text where the name is mentioned, is from 1304. The name may be related to the Swedish word toft, meaning thwart. In the greater Tofta area there are a number of remnants from earlier eras. During excavations, Stone Age settlements and a cist has been found. There are stone ships and grave mounds from the Bronze Age, and from The Iron Age there are 23 grave fields, groove stones, stone walls, a picture stone and a hillfort. There are also runes chiseled on a stone in the church. The stone is from 1170‚Äì90, and is a more likely to have been a tombstone than a runestone dedicated to a man called R√∂de Orm (\\"Red Snake\\"), a common name at that time.  Places of interest  A reconstruction of a Viking village has been made in Tofta, where visitors can try out life during the Viking age.

He was the first American-born chef to serve in the capacity. Early life and education Hill was born in Spokane, Washington, about 1954 to Victor M. Hill, a chef and instructor of hotel-motel and restaurant management at Spokane Community College. His grandfather was also a chef. Hill fell in love with fine cooking at the age of 16. After graduating from high school, he studied restaurant management under his father at Spokane Community College in 1974, then transferred to Portland Community College in 1976. He then entered the three-year Greenbrier Culinary Apprentice Program at The Greenbrier luxury resort near White Sulphur Springs in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, where he was taught classic French cooking by master chef Hermann G. Rusch. Hill excelled at sauces and the presentation of cold food. Rusch later called him the \\"best of the 18 graduates\\" of 1977, and had high praise for his skills and attention to detail. He also called Hill one of the best students he ever had. Rodney Stoner, food and beverage director at The Greenbrier, called Hill \\"definitely one of the outstanding graduates in the history of the school\\". Hill then enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, where he received his associate degree in restaurant and food services in 1980. Professional career Early positions Hill's professional career began as a Chef de partie (or station chef) at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel in Kohala, Hawaii. He was promoted to sous-chef. After five years at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, Hill was transferred to a position as executive sous-chef at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona. Kim Dietrich, chef de cuisine (executive chef) at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel at the time, called him an exciting and all-around chef, a perfectionist, loyal, and extraordinarily gifted at detail work. After two or three years at the Arizona Biltmore, in September 1986 Hill took a position as the chef de cuisine (executive chef) at the Westin Cypress Creek Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (which he helped opened). At the Westin Cypress Creek, Hill oversaw a staff of 100 and the preparation and presentation of modern American cuisine in two restaurants. He was noted for his delicately flavored sauces and finishes and for his exquisite skill as sculpting ice and tallow. Jen Campbell, food and beverage administrator for the entire Westin Hotels chain, praised Hill as gregarious, care-free, and very relaxed. Raymond Sylvester, general manager of the Westin Cypress Creek, called Hill gifted with \\"a great disposition [and] an extraordinary sense of organization\\". White House Hill first came to the attention of the White House in 1979. Hill was still a student at the Greenbriar, and his class made a visit to the White House to see its kitchens. White House Executive Chef Henry Haller made Hill's acquaintance at that time. Haller approached Hill about taking the White House job. White House Chief Usher Gary J. Walters also learned about Hill's reputation from chefs and culinary experts around the country, and he visited Hill's kitchen in late July 1987. After a two-month search, about 20 to 30 unmarried candidates were seriously considered for the job. Hill was one of three or five finalists allowed to audition his cooking skills for First Lady Nancy Reagan. He was chosen for the position of White House Executive Chef about August 19. He won the position largely because Haller endorsed him, and because his colleagues felt he was \\"exceptionally well-organized...with a flair for imaginative presentation\\". He was the first native-born American to become White House Executive Chef. Hill oversaw a staff of just three: two sous-chefs and an executive pastry chef. Hill spent about a month working alongside Haller before assuming the role of Executive Chef on October 1, 1987. His primary job was to cook meals for the First Family. By December 1987, Hill had also overseen the planning, preparation, cooking, and presentation for state dinners for Chaim Herzog, President of Israel, Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte, President of El Salvador, as well as an extremely important and sensitive state dinner on December 8, 1987 for Mihail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Hill's tenure at the White House was short. On January 8, 1988, Hill resigned after First Lady Nancy Reagan expressed significant disapproval of his cooking and presentation. He was replaced by White House assistant chef Hans Raffert. Post-White House After leaving the White House, Hill enrolled at the University of Phoenix, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in business management. He then received a Master of Arts in Teaching degree from Grand Canyon University. He also received a certification as an Executive Chef from the American Culinary Federation and a certification as a Food and Beverage Executive from the American Hotel & Lodging Educational Institute. From 1992 to 2002, Hill was chef de cuisine at the luxury Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park, Arizona, near Phoenix.; ; In 2002, Hill was appointed director of the Culinary Studies program at Estrella Mountain Community College in Avondale, Arizona. He is a member of the Resort Food Executive Committee, a group of current and former luxury resort chefs de cuisine which discusses, analyzes, and helps to resolve issues and challenges faced by resort chefs.

This species was previously described in Australia as Sphaerosyllis erinaceus and S. erinaceus erinaceus, a species distributed throughout the globe. These species appear to be a species complex. Previous descriptions stated that the two aforementioned species possess compound chaetae blades which are long and slender. Several subspecies of S. erinaceus were described on the basis of differences in shapes and sizes of their compound chaetae; such differences are enough to consider them as distinct species.San Mart√≠n, G. (2005). Exogoninae (Polychaeta: Syllidae) from Australia with the description of a new genus and twenty-two new species. Records of the Australian Museum. 57(1): 39-152., available online at https://dx.doi.org/10.3853/j.0067-1975.57.2005.1438, page(s): 55-57, figs. 11A-G, 12A-E. The species is named in honour of Gesa Hartmann-Schr√∂der, an expert on syllid species. Description The species' body is small, with a total length of and width of , including about 30 chaetigers. It possesses short papillae on its dorsum, parapodia and cirri. Its prostomium is ovate, showing 4 eyes in a trapezoidal arrangement, as well as 2 anterior eyespots. Its antennae have bulbous bases and short tips, its median antenna shorter than the combined length of its prostomium and palps. The palps are shorter than its prostomium, fused along their length. Its peristomium forms a trilobed hood, covering the prostomium. It carries two densely ciliated nuchal organs. Its tentacular cirri and antennae are alike, but smaller, the dorsal cirri being longer than the tentacular cirri, being absent on chaetiger 2. Its parapodia are rectangular, with two small papillae. It shows heteromorphic compound chaetae, with smooth shafts, provided with fine spines. The blades are short and unidentate, all similar in length, approximately ranging from 10 to 13¬µm. Its anterior parapodia count with about 6-7 compound chaetae. The number of posterior compound chaetae declines to a number of 5 on each posterior parapodium. Erinaceusyllis hartmannschroederae shows dorsal simple chaetae on anterior parapodia from chaetiger 1, provided sometimes with marginal spines. The ventral simple chaetae are slender and unidentate. Its acicula is solitary and acuminate. The pharynx spans approximately 4 segments. Its pharyngeal tooth is placed near the opening. Its proventricle is long and wide, barrel-shaped, spanning 3 to 4 segments, with 18-20 muscle cell rows. Its pygidium is semicircular, with 2 anal cirri, similar to its dorsal cirri but rather longer and with papillae. Distribution E. hartmannschroederae is thought to inhabit the entire Australian continent; however the holotypes were initially found throughout the southern coast of Australia, from Byron Bay, New South Wales to Bundegi Reef, Western Australia, in all kinds of sediments, intertidal to depths of approximately .

On 22 October 1939 he commissioned into the 6th Battalion, Black Watch and went to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. He saw action in the Battle of France. In 1940 he joined No. 8 (Guards) Commando in the Middle East and participated in Operation Flipper. In 1941 Sutherland served with the 1 Special Boat Service before serving with 1 Special Air Service (D Squadron) in the Western Desert between 1942 and 1943.

From 1943 to 1945 he was Commanding Officer of S Detachment of the Special Boat Squadron operating in Palestine and the Greek islands. He was mentioned in dispatches in January 1945 for \\"gallant & distinguished services against the enemy in the field.\\" Following the end of the Second World War, Sutherland was on the British military mission to Greece in 1946 (being awarded the Greek War Cross), before becoming an instructor at Sandhurst.

It was established under the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007 and came into operation on 1 October 2008, replacing the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman. The Commission investigates and resolves complaints about inadequate professional service provided by solicitors, advocates, and commercial attorneys, but only investigates how the complaint was dealt with by the relevant professional organisation. Conduct complaints are referred to the relevant professional organisation. The Commission has the power to fine legal practitioners whose service is sub-standard, but has no power to suspend or remove a solicitor's license to practice - such power rests with the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal. Decisions of the Commission are subject to judicial review by the Court of Session. As of May 2018, the Chair of the Commission is Jim Martin, and the Chief Executive is Neil Stevenson  History  Proposals for the Scottish Legal Services Commission were announced by the Scottish Executive on 22 December 2005. The proposals retained self-regulation of conduct with the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates, with only unresolved service complaints being in the remit of the new Commission. The proposals also stated that funding of the new Commission would come from a levy on practising lawyers, and a further levy on those who are subject to complaints. Such proposals were not without criticism with both the Dead of the Faculty of Advocates and President of the Law Society of Scotland criticising the complexity and costs of the proposed system. The Commission was established under the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007 and came into operation on 1 October 2008, replacing the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman. Previously, Bill Brackenridge had served as Chair, having taken over in February 2013, from Jane Irvine who had been the first chair of the Commission and who left office at the end of 2012. Jane Irvine had served the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman from April 2006. On 20 March 2018, the Law Society of Scotland criticised the Commission's proposal for a larger budget for 2018/19, and a 10% rise in the levy on solicitors. The President of the Law Society of Scotland stated, \\"People rightly ask why the SLCC is increasing its budget when eligible complaints for them to investigate are falling.\\"  Remit and jurisdiction   Consumer Panel  The Commission has a Consumer Panel which is mandated by Schedule 1, Section 11A of the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 2007.  Finances  The Commission is responsible for managing its own finances and setting its own annual budget and it is not funded by the public. It has an annual income of around ¬£1.8million, raised through a levy which is collected from the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates and the Association of Commercial Attorneys.  Judicial Review  Decisions of the Commission are subject to judicial review by the Court of Session, but can only be heard with the permission of the Court. However, a complaint can only be brought if the following grounds are met, set out in Section 21 of the 2007 Act are met: # that the Commission's decision was based on an error of law; # that there has been a procedural impropriety in the conduct of any hearing by the Commission on the complaint; # that the Commission has acted irrationally in the exercise of its discretion; # that the Commission's decision was not supported by the facts found to be established by the Commission.  Service and Conduct Complaints  The Commission was designed a single-point of contact for complaints against legal practitioners, and as such has the power to determine if a complaint is service-related or conduct-related. Service-related complaints remain with the Commission, whilst conduct complaints are sent to the relevant professional organisation. By 2016, the Commission had developed a practice of classifying a complaint as a hybrid complaint - being both service and conduct related. However, the Inner House of the Court of Session ruled, in 2016, that the Commission lacked this power, and had to classify a complaint as either service-related or conduct-related. The Inner House deemed it ultra vires for the Commission to make a determination that a complaint was a hybrid of conduct and service. The Law Society of Scotland challenged the Commission's power to decide if a complaint previously classified as hybridwas either a service-related or conduct-related complaint. The Inner House found, unanimously, in favour of the Commission, affirming that the Commission has power as a matter of law of re-categorise or re-determine any previously categorised hybrid complaint. The Commission alone has the power to determine if a complaint is service-related or conduct-related, and such power is an exercise of administrative law, and as such is within its power.

He later earned a D.Min degree from United Theological Seminary, (2004) where he studied the effects of white privilege on the Church.

He previously served in the Missouri Mid-South Conference UCC and as the pastor of First Congregational United Church of Christ and Zion United Church of Christ, both of Missouri. Dorhauer was the first person to conduct a legal same sex wedding in the state of Arizona when he performed the wedding service of David Laurence and Kevin Patterson on October 17, 2014. General Minister and President On March 19, 2015, Dorhauer was approved as nominee to serve as UCC General Minister and President. During the 30th General Synod, held in Cleveland, Ohio in June 2015, the nomination came before the delegates on June 29, 2015. Numerous delegates at the Synod voiced their concern at how the nomination failed to support minority diversity among leadership in the UCC, while many others publicly praised the nomination. When the vote was called, 85% of the voting delegates approved the candidate's election. Dorhauer replaced the Rev. Dr. Geoffrey Black. John is the tenth person to lead the UCC since the denomination was formed in 1957. He said that there will be two main themes to his tenure. One is to call on the denomination to rethink itself and to consider new ways of ‚Äúbeing church‚Äù in light of reduced societal interest in institutional religion, and the steep decline in the membership of the UCC since the 1960s. He says alternatives to institutional churches, what some call the \\"emergent church,\\" will not immediately supplant, but will grow alongside the institutional church for a long time. He will also call on the UCC to address white privilege.Clarkson, Frederick. Racial Justice Will Be Top Priority for New Prez of the United Church of Christ Religion Dispatches, August 20, 2015.

It stars Alex Neustaedter, Kian Lawley, Bella Thorne and Anton Starkman. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 14, 2016. The film was scheduled to be released through video on demand on October 11, 2016, by Awesomeness Films and 20th Century Fox. Plot Jimmy (Neustaedter), his brother Lump (Starkman), and Dan (Lawley) mourn their recently deceased best friend Sammy (Labes) from leukemia. At Sammy's funeral, however, Dan becomes jealous of Jimmy, blaming him for his death and Sammy's family wants his body to be cremated. The three receive a video of Sammy's will and testament from his phone, saying that he wants to be buried with his favorite football jersey. They notify Sammy's parents of their son's final will, but the parents do not believe that Sammy made the video willingly. Not giving up on fulfilling their best friend's will, Sammy's sister Kate (Thorne) sneaks out of her house to team up with the three and they head to the funeral home where Sammy's body is to be cremated. They wear his jersey and retrieve Sammy's body. The funeral home's owner discovers the body was stolen and subsequently alerts the police. The four then burglarize a hardware store to acquire digging tools, attracting the police again. The four head up to the hills to bury him, but because the soil is tough, the tools break, so they decide to bury Sammy at the school's stadium construction site. The four stop at a liquor shop to buy some food to eat, and a police officer comes their way and suspects them as the ones responsible for the events in the funeral home and the hardware store, though they manage to escape. While on the road, Dan confronts Jimmy about Sammy. When they suddenly see a red traffic light flashing, Jimmy swerves the car to avoid the intersection, causing the car to flip. Recovering from the wreck, Dan walks out carrying Sammy, and Lump's arm is injured. Kate confronts Jimmy for ignoring her after her brother's death. Jimmy convinces her that Sammy left everything that he wanted to him, and goes to find Dan to retrieve Sammy. However, Dan changes his mind, saying that he doesn't want to bury him at the stadium. After persuading Dan, he lets Jimmy carry Sammy and continues walking alone. Jimmy is then interrogated by Sammy's father, eventually allowing Jimmy to follow his son's wishes. Jimmy steals the ambulance which treats Kate and Lump. They catch Dan and head to the stadium construction site. The four say their last words to Sammy before they finally bury Sammy in peace.

Print Wikipedia is an art project by Michael Mandiberg that printed 106 of the 7,473 volumes of English Wikipedia as it existed on April 7, 2015. The project shows the spines of the first 1,980 volumes in the set, supplemented by 106 actual physical volumes, each of which runs to 700 pages. A 36-volume index of all of the 7.5 million contributors to English Wikipedia is also part of the project. The table of contents takes up 91 700-page volumes. The printed volume only includes text of the articles: images and references are not included.Wikipedia, Volume 0873, Arturo O'Farrill Jr. --- Art Deco, Publisher Michael Mandiberg, 2015, page 611450 The project was shown at the Denny Gallery in New York City in the summer of 2015. Similar projects have been held with a printed part of the German Wikipedia (Berlin, 2015) and with the Dutch Wikipedia (Ghent, 2016) Wikipedia page from Contributor Appendix (detail) Mandiberg originally thought of the project in 2009 but ran into technical difficulties. He then engaged an assistant, Jonathan Kirinathan, to aid with the programming of the code to compile, format and upload an entire English Wikipedia download. The print files were uploaded to self book publisher Lulu.com and are available for printout as paper volumes. Mandiberg's motivation was to answer the question, \\"How big is it?\\" For a big data entity, its size is on the threshold of what can be perceived as a collection of volumes, but not so large as to overwhelm one's senses, such as the data files of Facebook or the NSA. Katherine Maher, the Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, described it as \\"a gesture at knowledge\\". Wikimedia cooperated with the project and Lulu.com helped fund it. The task took three years, and the upload process took 24 days, 3 hours and 18 minutes. It was completed on 12 July 2015. PediaPress had attempted to raise money for a full English Wikipedia printout on Indiegogo in 2014, with a goal of $50,000 (¬£30,000), but the project was pulled. The pulled project had intended to print 1,000 volumes, which would include 1,200 pages each: 1,200,000 pages in total equal to about 80 meters of shelf space. Mandiberg later assured people that he won't be printing out the entire collection, claiming an entire collection is not necessary for people to comprehend the true size of Wikipedia, and once people have seen a portion of it, it will help them realize its size. Mandiberg estimates that the printing costs of a full printout would be around $500,000. The Denny art exhibit featured only a selection of actual printed volumes with about 2,000 of the other volumes represented as spines on the wall. The show revolved around the actual upload of the print files to Lulu.com.

The organization advocates on behalf of agunot and promotes the universal adoption of Jewish prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal (a get is a bill of Jewish divorce). Although 98% of the people ORA helps are women, they also support men whose wives refuse to accept a get. ORA views get-refusal as a form of domestic abuse. Keshet Starr is the Executive Director of the organization.  History  ORA was founded in 2002 by a group of Yeshiva University students. Since then, the organization has resolved over 220 cases of get-refusal, and at any given time is actively involved in approximately 50 open agunah cases. In 2014, the Slingshot Guide named ORA as one of the most innovative non-profit organizations in North America for its success in \\"advocating for vulnerable women and changing the conversation about divorce in the Orthodox community\\".  Advocacy efforts  ORA resolves cases of get-refusal by combining facilitation with advocacy. Their strategies may include \\"staging protests in front of a husband's home and office, urging his community and synagogue to keep him out, raising awareness in the media and applying financial and legal pressure.\\" ORA's advocacy efforts on behalf of agunot have been covered by several major newspapers, including The New York Times, New York Post, Washington Post, Newsweek, The Daily Beast, New York Daily News, and The Huffington Post.  Educational initiatives  ORA's Agunah Prevention Initiative raises awareness in the Jewish community about the importance of signing the Jewish prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal. The tagline of their initiative is: \\"Friends don't let friends get married without the halachic prenup\\", and in November 2014, ORA released a video to promote that message. While there is no way to know definitively if Jewish prenuptial agreements are becoming more popular in the Orthodox world, Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann, Director of the Beth Din of America, stated that, \\"Anecdotally, there appears to have been a big increase in awareness and usage in the last few years.\\"  References   External links  * Agunot Jewish marital law Marriage and religion Women's political advocacy groups in the United States ","title":"Organization for the Resolution of Agunot"},{"id":"47112967","text":"Everybody's Doin' the Hustle & Dead on the Double Bump is the 41st studio album by American musician James Brown.

It was first described by the French botanists Jean Marie Bosser and Philippe Morat in 2001. The type specimen was collected in 1974 by Bosser and Morat from the woods near Ankazoabo, but it has also been found south of Sakaraha, near Mahaboboka, and near Morombe. The specific epithet peyrotii was given to this species in honor of Dr. Jean-Pierre Peyrot whose observations and collections have led to a better understanding of Malagasy orchids.Bosser, J., and P.

Adansonia, 23(1): 7-22. Description The conical pseudobulbs are about high by wide and heteroblastic (derived from a single internode). Each pseudobulb has a single ovate-pointed, leathery leaf with slightly wavy margins. The leaves are long by wide at the widest point and have long petioles that are hinged from the top of the pseudobulb. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and purplish on the underside, sometimes with darker stripes. The erect inflorescences are tall, of which only the terminal is a simple or compound raceme where the flowers emerge. The flowers are small, about in diameter. Oeceoclades peyrotii is a terrestrial species found growing in deciduous forests of southwestern Madagascar, where it is known from only four locations. It is similar to other small-flowered species such as O. rauhii, O. analavelensis, and O. analamerensis but can be distinguished from those species by the differing characters of the labellum and spur and by the length of the petiole.

When the Ottoman commander Jezzar Pasha stayed in Egypt in the late 18th century, he developed a close association with the Ainawiyeh tribe of the Damanhur region near the Nile Delta. On Jezzar's return to Palestine to end the autonomous rule of Zahir al-Umar and his sons on behalf of the Sublime Porte, he took with him a contingent of Ainawiyeh tribesmen and gave them the honorary name of 'Arab al-Hawwara, which was meant to associate them with the well-known, but unrelated, Upper Egyptian tribe, who were \\"distinguished ... in bravery, horsemanship and equipments\\", according to Macalister and Masterman. Following his death in 1804, Jezzar, who had become the Acre-based governor of Sidon Eyalet, was succeeded by Suleiman Pasha al-Adil. In 1811, Musa moved to Gaza in Palestine.Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. 291 Musa sought to enjoy the favor Suleiman and his predecessor gave to the Hawwara tribesmen and requested military service. Suleiman made him a commander of the Hawwara horsemen and his successor Abdullah Pasha promoted Musa to be in charge of an even larger Hawwara contingent. Along with his co-commander, Ali Abu Zayd Agha, Musa was in charge of 400 horsemen.Thackston, 1988, p. 58 According to the Macalister and Masterman, Musa \\"was famed for his bravery and generosity.\\" According to Macalister and Masterman, Musa died during Abdullah Pasha's siege of Sanur.

The alcoholic beverage is often produced in Tropical African countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia and Burundi as one of the major traditional and local alcoholic drink. It is commonly consumed in Northern Guinea savanna region of Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin. Production Burukutu production involves five basic stages, which includes: steeping, malting, mashing, fermentation and maturation. The production begins by malting, which involves the conversion of the Guinea corn or millet grains into malt and this takes place on a malting floor. This process is followed by steeping, which involves the soaking of the grains in water for at least three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to begin to sprout. When the grain has absorbed enough moisture, it is transferred to the malting floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried. This procedure is followed by mashing in which the milled grain known as the \\"grain bill\\" (malted grain) is mixed with water known as \\"liquor\\" and heating the mixture. This process allows the enzymes in the grain bill to decompose the starch in the grain into sugars (maltose) to form a wort. The product is allowed to ferment using the sugar fungi form of yeast and allow maturation for 2 days or 48 hours. Gallery See also * Umqombothi, Chibuku and Munkoyo or 'Ibwatu' in Zambia.

Homocore magazine, Caja is shown in \\"post-apocalyptic deconstructive drag\\" during a show at the Deaf Club, San Francisco. Early life and education Jerome Caja was born on January 20, 1958 in Cleveland, Ohio. Raised in a strict Catholic family, Caja was one of 11 sons. He referred to his family as a family full of jocks, although he himself was a frail sickly child. Caja having being raised in a strict Catholic household was early on heavily influenced by the imagery of saints and martyrs. Caja graduated from St. Edward High School, an all-boys catholic school, where he suffered poor grades due to dyslexia. Caja began his college education at Cuyahoga Community College and later attended Cleveland State University where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1984. He then moved to San Francisco to attend the San Francisco Art Institute and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1986. Career In the late 1980s, Caja became a well-known artistic personality within the radical gay scene in San Francisco. Caja performed as a drag queen and go-go dancer in San Francisco's queer punk nightclubs, where his performance art has been described as \\"post-apocalyptic deconstructive drag.\\" In one Easter performance at Club Uranus, Caja in drag performed an elaborate reenactment of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Caja began by producing ceramic sculptures and then he moved on to create paintings. Caja crafted miniature mixed-media artworks which he created from everyday materials, especially those used by drag queens such as nail polish, sequins, lace and glitter. Caja was a fan of makeup even before he was diagnosed with AIDS, so he transferred his own affection for makeup straight into his artistic work. Many of Caja's works were influenced by Catholic iconography and satirized Christian morality. Professor of Communication Fred Turner described Caja's paintings as \\"fragments of a private allegory -- often dizzyingly grotesque, but also glorious, gentle and sad.\\" While in his other artwork, he tried to express his own fearlessness. Death According to Caja, he tested positive for HIV around 1989 and began to show symptoms of sickness around 1992. Caja as well suffered from CMV retinitis as result of the diagnosis. In August and September 1995, the Archives of American Art recorded an oral history interview with Caja. He died of AIDS in San Francisco on November 3, 1995. His memorial service was held at the Hole in the Wall gay bar in South of Market, San Francisco. Artworks Caja's art is located in the New York Public Library and the Los Angeles County Museum. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) twice provided exhibits of paintings by Caja. Before his death, Caja gifted his unsold artworks to the SFMOMA. Caja's personal papers and effects are archived in the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to the locations mentioned above, The Jerome Project, was created to bring greater visibility and accessibility to Caja's artwork. The Jerome Project is a non profit organization, that was created by Anthony Cianciolo in order to preserve and protect the artistic legacy of Caja. The Jerome Projects' goal is to bring recognition to Caja as an important 20th century artist and not simply as a marginalized, controversial, gay artist.

Its peristomium measures the same as its succeeding segments, and is bilobed, forming two anterior wings that cover the prostomium dorsally. Its tentacular cirri and antennae are alike, but smaller, the dorsal cirri being longer than the tentacular cirri and shorter than the antennae, being absent on chaetiger 2. Its parapodia are conical, with few papillae. It shows heteromorphic compound chaetae, with smooth blades or provided with straight spines. The blades are unidentate and distally somewhat hooked. Its anterior parapodia count with about 5-7 compound chaetae each, with dorsoventral gradation in length (23 to 13¬µm long); the posterior parapodia count with 4 compound chaetae. Erinaceusyllis kathrynae shows dorsal simple chaetae from chaetiger 1, provided sometimes with short marginal spines. The ventral simple chaetae are slender and unidentate, arising from the midbody. Its acicula is solitary and acuminate, with a rather long and filiform tip. The pharynx is slender and spans approximately 3 segments. Its pharyngeal tooth is rhomboidal, small and placed near the opening. Its proventricle is long and wide, barrel-shaped, spanning through 3 segments, with 15-17 muscle cell rows. Its pygidium is small, with long papillae and elongate anal cirri. Distribution E. kathrynae is thought to habitat a substantial portion of the Australian continent, however the holotypes were initially found throughout the southern coast of Australia, from South Solitary Island, New South Wales to Cape Range National Park, Western Australia, in coral rubble, sponges and coralline algae, in depths of between .

The company and its products have been featured in several publications including Forbes, HFMA, Modern Healthcare, PaymentsSource, and TechCrunch. History Early years and initial funding Simplee was founded by Tomer Shoval who currently serves as the company CEO. In 2009 he went on vacation to Mexico and his entire family got sick. Upon returning to the United States, he received invoices, bills, and insurance statements associated with the trip. Shoval became frustrated with trying to decipher the documents and decided to create a software to manage and track health expenses for both patients and health care providers. He was working at eBay at the time and stepped down to form the company with Roberto Rabinovich and Tom Tsarfati, launching the company in 2010. Simplee received $1.8 million in angel funding led by Greylock IL and launched its first product in 2011, a free consumer app initially known as Simplee for tracking medical expenses similar to the financial management tools of Mint.com. The product was branded as SimpleeONE, and linked health insurance accounts for easier management of medical bills and payments across providers. Enterprise launch and additional funding In 2012, Simplee launched its enterprise software platform SimpleePAY for health care providers after receiving $6 million Series A investment led by Social+Capital Partnership. SimplePAY was specific for health care providers, allowing patients to view and pay their medical bills online. Simplee raised an additional $10 million in Series B funding led by Nashville-based healthcare investor The Heritage Group in 2013. The same year it partnered with its charter customer, El Camino Hospital. The company grew its customers in 2014 by adding healthcare providers such as CardinalHealth, Gundersen Health System, LifePoint Health, and Memorial Hermann Healthcare System, the largest health system in Texas. Simplee also partnered with ExactTarget, Vantiv, and Wells Fargo the same year. Products and services SimplePAY is specific for health care providers, allowing patients to view and pay their medical bills online. In March 2015, it was reported that Simplee was collecting over $1 Million per day through SimpleePAY, with an expectation to collect more than $1 billion by the end of 2015. Modern Healthcare featured Simplee‚Äôs partnership with Memorial Hermann in May 2015, in which Memorial Hermann‚Äôs PayMyBill technology, powered by SimpleePAY, has seen self-service payments increase by 53% and reduced collection costs by 23%. In June 2015, Simplee expanded SimpleePay into the Simplee Financial Engagement Platform suite with the launch of two additional products: SimpleeESTIMATE, a cost estimation tool, and SimpleeCREDIT, a consumer-focused financing options system. Awards and recognition Simplee has been a Webby Award honoree in 2012, 2013, and 2015. It was a winner of a Fierce Innovation Award in 2014 in the revenue cycle category.

In the 1940s, de Courcy was part of a plot by conservative members of the British royal court to return the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to Britain and establish a regency.  Life and career  Kenneth de Courcy was born in Galway, Ireland in 1909. He became wealthy as a businessman, owning a chain of tobacco shops and other businesses. In 1934, de Courcy became secretary of the Imperial Policy Group, a grouping of right-wing Conservative MPs, which focused on \\"the importance of Imperial development\\" and \\"close friendship with the United States\\". Later the group supported appeasement of Nazi Germany as the best means of preserving the British Empire, and in that capacity de Courcy travelled Europe making high level contacts. In 1934, he founded Courcy‚Äôs Intelligence Service to provide early warning intelligence to businesses and government. Four years later he began Intelligence Digest (now Courcy‚Äôs Intelligence Brief, together with The Weekly Review. He was joined in business by a cousin, John de Courcy, 35th Baron Kingsale. De Courcy was accused in the War Cabinet minutes of 13 April 1942 of being \\"up to mischief\\" by \\"writing poisonous publications about the Russians\\". In 1952 on the death of George VI he wrote to Winston Churchill suggesting Elizabeth II develop a closer relationship with the abdicated King Edward, now living abroad. In 1950, de Courcy married Rosemary Catherine Baker, who was also from Ireland. They had four children. The marriage was dissolved in 1973. Between 1953 and 1964 he was a member of the committee of the Evangelical Alliance which organised Billy Graham's 'crusades' in Great Britain. At several points in his life de Courcy believed the British Security Service (MI5) were intercepting his mail and telephone communications. In the 1960s, via a company called Sarsden Consolidated Properties, de Courcy planned a garden city development in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He was unable to return the funds put up by investors and was jailed for seven years for fraud. De Courcy escaped from custody when he was allowed to visit his lawyer as part of his appeal, although he was recaptured. De Courcy went on to edit publications such as Banker's Digest and Special Office Brief. In December 2005, an appeal to De Courcy's 1964 court case was upheld as a miscarriage of justice by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

Overview Aerial view of the Sussex campus The film was made in response to the university's plans to close its chemistry department, which were abandoned in May 2006. The plans were met with protests in the media and in Parliament, and vice-chancellor Alasdair Smith was called before the Science and Technology Select Committee. The film also draws attention to Sussex's installation of a high-speed data network and its restructuring of academic departments, both of which ran significantly over budget; and claims the university was ¬£38.2 million in debt. The film concludes by naming the university's governance as its primary problem, and calls for greater consultation with staff and greater accountability. From the Top Down lasts 35 minutes. Production and distribution The film was directed by Daniel Vockins, then a second-year international relations and philosophy student, who said his intention was to produce an \\"objective analysis\\" of the university's problems. The information presented in the documentary is taken from Freedom of Information requests, official university documents and interviews with figures including Member of Parliament Des Turner and chemist Harry Kroto. Vockins said the university had warned against making the documentary and sought to prevent him from conducting interviews with academics. The film was made available on the website of the Sussex student union and copies were sent to Sussex academics, vice-chancellors and student unions of 1994 Group universities, the Royal Society, then- Conservative Party higher education spokesman Boris Johnson, and others. Response Smith said he was \\"pleased that our students feel passionately about Sussex, just as I and my colleagues do\\" but that it was a \\"pity that ‚Äì despite opening initial discussions when filming starting ‚Äì the students who made the film didn't seek to obtain views or comments from the university on the issues it raises\\". Smith also refuted allegations of financial mismanagement. A statement released by the university said many issues raised in the film had been rectified, that improvements were being made to student facilities, and that the university had sought to improve its relationship with the student union and strengthen student representation in its decision- making processes. Roger Hilton, the president of the student union, however, said that governance had not improved, to the detriment of \\"staff morale and the student experience.\\" William Outhwaite, a professor of sociology, and Andrew Chitty, a lecturer in philosophy, both praised the film. Chitty said \\"The film provides a convincing case for serious shortcomings in the management of the university over the last few years.\\" References External links * British documentary films British films Documentary films about higher education University of Sussex 2006 documentary films Films set in East Sussex ","title":"From the Top Down"},{"id":"47113774","text":"The Abbey of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw ter Nieuwe Plant (\\"Our Lady of the New Plantation\\"; ), formerly also Roesbrugge Abbey () is a community of Augustinian canonesses belonging to the Congregation of Windesheim. The sisters are informally known as the Roesbrugge Dames - the Roesbrugge Ladies. Located in Roesbrugge from 1239 to the late 16th century, the community then moved into Ypres, West Flanders, Belgium, where it exists today. Its adjacent school is the Lyceum Onze Lieve Vrouw ter Nieuwe Plant.Inventaris: Lyceum O-L-V ter Nieuwe Plant History The abbey was founded in 1239 at Roesbrugge by Willem van Bethune and his wife Elisabeth van Roesbrugge for the Canonesses Regular of St. Victor of Pr√©my Abbey near Cambrai.DBNL.org: Onze-Lieve-Vrouwe ter Nieuwe Plant foundation story They are believed to have opened a school. The abbey thrived, but in 1572 began the troubles of the Eighty Years' War. Marauding Calvinist soldiers made Roesbrugge uninhabitable for the community. Some of them sought refuge in Ypres, others in St. Omer. The abbey was pillaged by the Calvinists and subsequently laid waste by Spanish troops.Dom Anselm Hoste, 1986 Once the County of Flanders was again in the hands of the King of Spain, the sisters in St. Omer returned. The Council of Trent recommended that monasteries should re-settle in or near towns, and the community from Roesbrugge decided to settle permanently in Ypres. They began once again to provide schooling, but more incidents of war caused them further setbacks. In 1744 the abbey was destroyed by the troops of Louis XV, King of France, during the War of the Austrian Succession. Reconstruction began in 1778 and in 1782 the abbey was reopened. Yet again war intervened, this time between Austria and France in the French Revolution. For this reason, in 1793 a new abbess was not elected, only a prioress. In 1798 the abbey was seized by the French and sold. The sisters were dispersed, but after the Concordat of 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII were able to buy back a piece of ground immediately adjacent to the site of the former abbey, and began their work again, including the management of a boarding school. World War I forced the sisters to flee on 31 October 1914 and to take refuge in England. They moved to France in July 1915, where they helped Belgian students. When in February 1919 they returned to Ypres, everything was destroyed. In 1921 re- building began, to designs by the architect Camille Damman, and the abbey and its school have functioned since that time. In 1967 the sisters, together with the canonesses of Bruges, founded St. Agnes' Abbey in Sion, Switzerland, which lasted until 1994.Titus Brandsma Instituut: Moderne Devotie (Collatie 26) ] References External links *Biekorf.Jaargang 76: foundation story *Inventaris Onroerend Erfgoed: Lyceum Onze-Lieve-Vrouw ter Nieuwe Plant *Westhoek.be: Tentoonstelling abdij OLV-Ter Nieuwe Plant (1236-1579) Bibliography *Hoste, D Anselm OSB, 1986: De abdij O.L.Vrouw Ter-Nieuwe- Plant. 1236 - 1986 Roesbrugge Dames Ypres: publisher unknown *Verheede, Sister Marie Ang√®le, 1783: Annales de l'abbaye de Notre-Dame de la Nouvelle Plante.

Ranked 126th by suicide rate globally by the 2015 World Health Organization report, Nepal has an estimated 6,840 suicides annually, or 8.2 suicides per 100,000 people. Suicide is currently the leading cause of death for Nepalese women aged 15‚Äì49. Underreporting The rate of suicide in Nepal has been reported to be as low as 3.7/100,000 as a result of under reporting caused by issues of legality, social stigma, and logistical problems. Suicide is illegal in Nepal and is punishable by fines and imprisonment. According to the director of Samanta, a Nepalese organization for women‚Äôs rights, \\"most families will never report suicide cases as they are afraid of being entangled in police cases.\\" In attempts to avoid legal trouble, suicidal patients and their families may avoid going to hospitals for treatment. Even after death, victims of suicide may have their deaths misattributed to avoid legal problems for their families. Families may also avoid reporting suicides due to social stigma and discrimination against people with mental health problems. Despite the recent abundance of articles discussing suicide in Nepal, issues related to suicide are largely avoided, both as the result and perpetuation of a powerful social stigma against mental illness. For women in particular, the under reporting of suicides and suicide- attempts may be caused in part by a \\"culture of silence\\", especially in cases related to domestic abuse. Finally, logistical issues pose a threat to accurate reporting and record keeping. According to the Nepal Health Sector Support Programme, due to \\"poor record keeping by police and hospitals\\" as well as the fact that \\"registration systems are inaccurate and of poor quality,\\" suicide may continue to be under reported even if social and legal issues were to be resolved. Gender In 2009, the Nepalese Family Health Division's Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study published the \\"shocking finding\\" that suicide was the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age (15-49). According to the report, \\"analysis of verbal autopsy data indicates mental health problems, relationships, marriage and family issues are key factors\\" with 21% of suicides among women of reproductive age consisting of women 18 or younger, \\"indicating that youth is a factor to be investigated.\\" Although the suicide rate for men remains higher almost universally as well as in Nepal (30.1/100,000 for men, 20.0/100,000 for women), Nepal has a relatively high ratio of female:male suicides and stands out as being ranked 17th for male suicide rates but 3rd for female suicide rates. It's worth noting that while male suicide rates are higher, it is estimated that Nepalese women attempt suicide three times more than men do. Additionally, the tie ins to maternal health, domestic violence, and youth have made female suicide a prominent issue. A case study published in the same mortality report exemplifies the type of problems that women may face: > Sanju was a 21 years old, illiterate and mother of two children. By her > third pregnancy she was anaemic and malnourished, feeling dizzy and weak, > but she received no antenatal care. In her third month of pregnancy she was > about to travel to her maternal home with her husband, but her relatives > stopped her as there was a flood. She went to her room to rest, but when her > mother-in-law went to her room an hour later she said she had eaten some > medicine for killing lice. Her husband, mother-in-law and neighbour took her > to the local medicine shop in their cart, and the pharmacist immediately > referred her to the district hospital. The family borrowed money and took > her to hospital in a private van, a 25 minute journey. She was admitted to > the emergency ward and attended to by the doctor immediately, but died > within a few hours. The above account was given by her mother-in-law. > However, the female community health volunteer said Sanju suffered from > hysteria and was being forced to have an illicit relationship with her > father-in-law. She was treated for her hysteria but forced to continue the > relationship, and therefore was tense. The FCHV and VHW felt this may have > been the reason she committed suicide. More indirectly, gender based inequality in Nepal has been suggested as the cause of female suicide in Nepal. The prominence of suicide among women of reproductive age may be as a result of unwanted pregnancies and early marriages. For Nepalese women, being married can come with the cost of leaving one's family and friends, creating a \\"perennial cycle of dependence, which may lead some to view suicide as their only option.

Todd, youngest child of Dr. Timothy and Phebe (Buel) Todd, was born in Rutland, Vt., October 9, 1800. In his childhood, his father died, and it was only by his own exertions that he was able to secure a liberal education. He graduated from Yale College in 1822. From college he went to Andover Seminary, where he completed the three years' course, and afterwards remained for nearly a year engaged in advanced study. On the 3d of Jan., 1827, he was ordained first pastor of the Union Church in Groton, Mass., and in the following March was married to Mary S., daughter of Rev. Joab Brace, of Newington, Conn. He resigned his charge at Groton, Jan. 8, 1833, and on the 30th of the same month was installed over the Edwards Church, Northampton, Mass. Here he remained until Nov. 4, 1836, when he removed to Philadelphia, where he was installed pastor of the First Congregational Church, on the 17th of the same month. This position he resigned in Nov, 1841, and soon after removed to Pittsfield, Mass., where he took charge of the First Congregational Church, Jan. 1, 1842, and was installed, Feb. 22. In 1870 he proposed to the church to lay down the active duties of pastor, but at their request his resignation was deferred, until in March, 1872, impaired health enforced his retirement. He died in Pittsfield, after an illness of three months Aug. 24, 1873, in his 73d year. His widow survived him, with five of their nine children, one of whom graduated Yale in 1855. In 1845 Mr. Todd received the degree of D.D. from Williams College, and was elected one of the trustees of that institution, which office he held until 1872. Dr. Todd was remarkably successful as a pastor, and also wielded a powerful influence as an author. He published over thirty volumes, besides many sermons and pamphlets. His most widely known book, \\"The Student's Manual,\\" was first published in 1835. The Reverend Doctor Was also notable for having taken part of the Golden Spike Ceremony at Promontory Point, Utah on May 10th 1869.

He was backed on the session by members of his Drifting Cowboys band, including Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton or \\"Cedric Rainwater,\\" aka Howard Watts (bass), and either Owen Bradley or Rose on piano. The song's subject manner is similar to \\"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You)\\" (which was recorded at the same session) in that the narrator admits that he is still madly in love with a woman who no longer loves him. The song begins with an impossibly high steel guitar lick played by Don Helms, which became one of the hallmarks of the Hank Williams sound courtesy of Fred Rose: :He gave Don Helms the golden rule for accompanying Hank. \\"Fred said it was useless for me and Hank to be in the same register,\\" said Helms. \\"He said, 'When Hank is singing something low why don't you play high, and if he's singing high, you play something low,' so the steel was always in a different register.\\" The song became well known due to the success of the \\"Hey Good Lookin'\\" single, which became Williams' sixth #1 country hit.

Co-founder of the Lodz-based avant-garde artistic group Workshop of the Film Form and member of the group in the 1970s. Around the same time that the Workshop came into being Kwiek created his famous project Face (Twarz, 1971), which criticised the regime of the 1st Secretary of the Polish Communist Party KC PZPR W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomulka (soon after he resigned from his office) and mocked the figure of the former 1st Secretary. In 1971, Kwiek worked with his brother Przemys≈Çaw, Zofia Kulik and Jan S. Wojciechowski on the film Open Form (Forma otwarta), whose title marks a reference to the Open Form Theory conceived by Oskar Hansen with a view to \\"improving communication and social individualism\\" (≈Å. Ronduda, Sztuka polska lat 70. Awangarda, Warszawa 2009, s. 176). Open Form was an experiment that explored the potential of such communication. Kwiek's film 1, 2, 3...

Her work now forms part of the USDA National Agricultural Library's Pomological Watercolor Collection. Watercolor of pecans (Carya illinoinensis) by Ellen Isham Schutt ca. 1904‚Äì14. Varieties shown include Taylor, Kennedy, Hodge, Bolton, and Carman. Early life and family Ellen Isham Schutt was born on April 15, 1873, in Oak Grove, Virginia, to Francis Granger Schutt (a merchant of Dutch descent) and Emily Elizabeth Thomas Schutt n√©e Wallis. She was one of seven children, with two brothers (Francis and Wallis) and four sisters (Blanch, Elizabeth, Stella, and Mary). They were raised in what is now Cherrydale, Virginia, where her father had bought land after the Civil War. Ellen's father eventually acquired nearly 300 acres in the area and is now considered one of the fathers of modern Cherrydale. In 1906, Ellen built a substantial neoclassical house in Cherrydale that was known as \\"Ellenwood.\\" It was built entirely of concrete as protection against fire, and it is said to have been the first home in the area to get electricity. Ellen and her mother were interested in genealogy and together created numerous unpublished family trees and other records relating to the Wallis family that were later archived at the Maryland Historical Society. In 1914, Ellen served as the state recording secretary of the Virginia chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In 1914, the year her father died, she married Walter David Blackburn in Florida. This marriage did not last, and in 1917 she married her first cousin, Thomas Smythe Wallis (1876‚Äì1949), in Virginia. Ellen died on December 5, 1955, at Falls Church, Virginia, and is buried in Columbia Gardens Cemetery in Arlington. Career Watercolor of lemons (Citrus limon) by Ellen Isham Schutt, 1910, showing red rot from five months of cold storage. Schutt worked for the United States Department of Agriculture between 1904 and 1914, part of a select cadre of illustrators that included Deborah Griscom Passmore, Amanda Newton, Royal Charles Steadman, J. Marion Shull, and Elsie Lower. During this period, she painted over 700 watercolors of fruits and nuts for the USDA. Her subjects ranged from the common (apples, hickory nuts) to the then-exotic (bael, custard apple, cashew nuts), and quite a few show fruit damage from molds, insects, and other causes. Her precise and rather dry style resulted in watercolors that at times look more like drawings than paintings. She signed her USDA watercolors 'E.I. Schutt'. She also modeled some fruit such as apples and pears in wax to demonstrate the effects of long storage and packaging upon fruit. She contributed a few drawings of plant specimens collected in Mexico to Britton and Rose's definitive work on cactus. Beginning in 1911, the University of California commissioned Schutt to paint watercolors of apples grown locally and showing damage from conditions ranging from disease and insect damage to storage injury. One scholar argues that this series of \\"hyperreal\\" images amounts to an implied representation of the idea of a perfect or normal apple, a vision suitable to Progressive era aspirations of control over natural forces like decay. The full series of 286 watercolors painted between 1911 and 1915 is held by the University of California, Davis.

Originally from Marietta, Ohio, she traveled often as an adult, though New York was her main place of residence. She was married to the well-known yellow journalist James Creelman. Personal life Creelman was born in Marietta, Ohio to Edward Wyllyss Buell and Melissa Barker. Both her father and her mother were descendants of pilgrims who traveled to America on the Mayflower. Though several accounts list her birth date as December 19, 1858, in a passport application from 1915 she writes that she was born on December 9, 1859.Ancestry.com Passport Application As well as dealing art, Creelman painted. In fact, according to a magazine published in 1896, she \\"won a reputation in New York and Paris with her clever paintings\\". The magazine further describes an earlier incident: The location and preservation status of Creelman's paintings are currently not known. Marriage Alice married James Creelman on December 10, 1891 in Paris. Written correspondence between the two shows they had been in contact since at least 1890.James Creelman papers- Finding Aid By 1894 she had begun writing a biographical sketch of James, who was already making a name as a reporter. The couple lived among and were friends with many of the New York City elite. Harry Scovel, an attempted recruit of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst who was invited to the Creelman's apartment for dinner, characterized the couple and their home as \\"charming\\". Creelman's husband, James, died in 1915 while reporting on World War I. When James fell ill in Berlin, Alice applied for a visa to go visit and tend to her husband, but did not make it to Germany before his death.Ancestry.com Passport application Indeed, she could not even reach his body because of the blockade. At this time Creelman was faced with financial issues. In a letter to Henry Clay Frick she lamented that \\"with the passing away of my husband, my life and fortune have been completely wrecked\\".Saving Face: Henry Clay Frick's Pursuit of Holbein Portraits p.97 Though James left his whole estate to his wife, and named her as \\"the sole executrix\\" of his will, the New York Times from 13, March 1915 also states that \\"Mr. Creelman left no real estate\\".New York Times, March 31, 1915 In August 1915, Creelman bought an apartment from Malcom E. Smith & Co, moving from the Upper West Side apartment she had shared with James to a \\"large, duplex\\" apartment at 131 East Sixty-sixth Street.New York Times, August 15, 1915 Photo on Mrs. Creelman's passport application After her move, Creelman, then 57, brought a suit against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company after a fall going down the stairs of Penn Station. Creelman suffered several broken bones as well as a severe concussion of the brain and spinal cord. She asked for $25,000 from the Rail Company because she asserted the cause of her fall was improper stairway treads that had the wrong type of \\"corrugations and grooves\\".New York Times, November 24, 1915 Children Alice and James had four children, James Ashmore (sometimes referred to as James Ashman), Constance Alice, Eileen Buell Creelman, and Edward Dunwoodie Creelman. Edward died shortly after birth and is buried in Marietta, Ohio. Her daughter Constance married Col. Harold Woods Huntley in 1918.New York Times May 14, 1918 Creelman's son James died in 1941. He was buried in a private ceremony at Walton Hall on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.New York Times, September 11, 1941 Career In a passport application from 1915, Creelman left the career section unfilled. However, she undoubtedly worked as an art dealer. She sold several Old Master paintings to Henry Clay Frick, listed below: *Whistler, James McNeill, 1834‚Äì1903, Symphony in Flesh Colour and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland‚Äîpurchased through Creelman in 1917 *Van Dyck, Anthony, Sir, 1599‚Äì1641, Sir John Suckling‚Äîpurchased through Creelman in 1918 *Titian (Tiziano Vecellio), 1477/1490 - 1576, Portrait of a Man in a Red Cap, 1516‚Äîpurchased through Creelman in 1915 *Hans Holbein, the Younger, 1497/1498 - 1543, Thomas Cromwell, 1532-1533‚Äîpurchased through Creelman in 1915The Frick Collection The Titian and the Holbein were acquired by Frick together in 1915, in a deal arranged by Creelman. Both paintings were owned by Sir Hugh Lane, who at this time was raising funds for the National Gallery of Ireland. This sale satisfied Frick's desire to add another Holbein to his collection. She wrote to him in April 1915: Alice made $26,000 in commission from the sale, which aided her injured financial situation. Frick had previously been approached about these paintings by Charles Carstairs, but refused the offer.Cynthia Saltzman, Old Masters, New World: America's Raid on Europe's Great Pictures (New York: Penguin Group, 2008), 247 Though many art dealers of the time were flamboyant in the marketing of their product, Creelman may have been a more inconspicuous dealer. She wrote that Lane approached her with the pictures because he wanted the matter to be handled discreetly. Social affiliations and friendships Creelman was a member of several organizations that based membership on genealogical ties to early Americans. In 1904 Creelman is listed as a member of Daughters of the American Revolution in their yearly bulletin. At this time she was still located in her hometown of Marietta at 221 4th street. Four years later in 1908 she appears again in the yearly bulletin, this time with her residency listed as 67 West 94th street, New York, NY. This would be her main home until after the death of her husband in 1915, when she moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her claim to membership of DAR was her relation to Captain Daniel Hand, from whom she is descended on her father's side. Captain Daniel Hand commanded the sixth company of the Revolutionary Army in Connecticut. Creelman was also a member of the National Society of Colonial Dames. In order to be a member of this society, she proved that she was sixth in descent from Major David Buel, and also descended from General Joseph Buell of Ohio. In addition, Creelman was able to join the General Society of Mayflower Descendants because of her relation to William Bradford. She joined the society in 1906, when she was living in New York, and was listed as a \\"Life and Regular Member\\". Though a bulletin published by the Mayflower Society specifies that Edward Wyllyss Buell, Creelman's father, was the parent descended from William Bradford, more recent genealogy charts trace her descent through her mother's line.Archive.org Mayflower Society BulletinThe McEntrye Family Project Though it is possible that both of Creelman's parents were distantly related to the same man who traveled from England to America in the 1620s, it is also likely that there was a mistake made either by the Mayflower Society or the historians behind the genealogical index. Alice Creelman was associated with many of the time's notable people. She was well acquainted with Henry Clay Frick, and through her husband she was familiar with William Randolph Hearst and composer Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. Another associate of theirs was Cora Crane, wife of Stephen Crane. In 1898, an incident occurred between the two women. Crane wrote to the Creelman family, asking for donations to her private fund for the children of Kate Lyon and Harold Frederic, who had died several months earlier. Alice responded in the negative, criticizing Kate Lyon for \\"the evil influence she has exerted over a morally weak man\\". Cora Crane responded to Creelman's letter, writing, \\"To me, the supreme egotism of women who never having been tempted, and so knowing nothing of the temptation of another's soul, set themselves upon their pedestals of self-conceit and conscious virtue, judging their unfortunate sisters guilty alike, is the hardest thing in life\\".Cora Crane: A Biography of Mrs. Stephen Crane ed.

Reception Flickering Myth gave the film two stars, stating that it \\"will probably prove to be quite popular with those into their British crime movies as it looks pretty good with some stunning wide shots of London in various different lights, and for Danny Dyer it‚Äôs something of a step up from his usual performance and will hopefully be seen as a defining moment for him, but otherwise Assassin is a little bit too underwhelming in the areas where it should have been stronger.\\" Movie Talk panned Assassin, writing \\"Danny Dyer's hard man whizzes to and from his assignments on a high-powered motorbike, but this crashingly dull low-budget British crime thriller couldn't be more pedestrian.\\" Charlie Lyne of The Guardian wrote, \\"Dyer doesn‚Äôt so much go through the motions in the role as plead with the audience to save him the bother and recall the motions from last time.\\" Matt Glasby of Total Film rated it 3/5 and wrote that although it is not enough to rehabilitate Dyer's reputation, \\"anyone looking for po-faced, paunch-free action could do much worse\\".

He represented some 10 mostly sparsely populated counties in the Texas Panhandle. Background Cates was born in Pampa, the seat of government of Gray County, northeast of Amarillo, to Herman Ray Cates (1917-1998), a veteran of the United States Army Air Forces of World War II, and the former Lavern Robertson (1923-2009), a native of Beckham County, Oklahoma. He was reared in nearby Lefors, also in Gray County, where his parents are interred at Memorial Heights Cemetery. Cates left Lefors in 1965 to enroll at West Texas A&M; University in Canyon, then known as West Texas State University. There, he was elected four times to the Student Senate and was a member of the Baptist Student Union and Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. In 1998, West Texas A&M; named him a \\"Distinguished Alumnus\\". Cates married, in 1970, the former Nancy Holt (also born 1947), originally from Pampa. Their two sons are Andrew and John Cates. Career In 1970, Cates was elected to succeed the two-term Republican Malouf Abraham, Sr., a wealthy businessman from Canadian in Hemphill County, whose District 84 was blended into revised District 79. Abraham instead ran unsuccessfully for the District 31 seat in the Texas State Senate against Democrat Max Sherman.Texas Almanac 1972/1973, Election returns from November 3, 1970 Cates won his own primary election in the spring by a margin of two votes. For his second term, Cates moved to Pampa in reconfigured District 66. Texas Monthly gave him unfavorable reviews in 1973; the publication called Cates part of \\"the furniture\\", a reference to those lawmakers who \\"have no discernible ability to grasp what is going on, and who for that reason do not participate to any significant extent in the proceedings.\\" By 1974, Cates was residing in Shamrock in Wheeler County for his third and fourth terms in the legislature. When he was moved to District 66 with the 1972 election, only Gray and Wheeler Counties were held over from his original District 79. After his four legislative terms, Cates became a lobbyist and worked in the capital city of Austin, first, with former Speaker Byron Tunnell from 1980 to 1989. He was a lobbyist for Tenneco of Houston for 9 years in 9 southeastern states. In Austin in 1989 and 1990, he was a lobbyist for the Texas Association of Business. In 1991, he joined the firm of former Speaker Bill W. Clayton, at which he remained until 1996, when he opened his own firm, Texas Stakeholders. He remained in that capacity until his death of lung cancer in 2014 at the age of 67. Cates, who had resided in Dripping Springs in Hays County near Austin, is interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, where graveside services were held on July 26, 2014, with his former legislative colleague Max Sherman among the speakers.

Names  In Chinese, the dynasty is referred to as: *The Zheng clan (). *The House of Zheng in Taiwan () *The Family of Koxinga ()  Overview  Territories of the House of Koxinga at their largest extent Following the Qing conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning in 1683, the territory's last ruler, Zheng Keshuang, Prince of Yanping, who was a grandson of Koxinga, was taken to Beijing. The Kangxi Emperor granted Zheng a peerage title, that of Duke Hanjun, and inducted him and his descendants into the Plain Red Banner. The family remained in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty's fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian, where they remain to this day. Koxinga's other descendants had the hereditary title of 'Sia'. They are found both on mainland China and in Taiwan, while descendants of Koxinga's brother Shichizaemon live in Japan. His descendants through one of his sons Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan. One of Koxinga's descendants on mainland China, Zheng Xiaoxuan ÈÑ≠ÊõâÂµê the father of Zheng Chouyu ÈÑ≠ÊÑÅ‰∫à, fought against the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him.

The route runs between Hogsmeade station in the Islands of Adventure theme park and King's Cross station in the London area of the Universal Studios Florida theme park. It provides a connection between the Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade areas which, together, form the Harry Potter-themed Wizarding World area, based on the Harry Potter film series. The system, which was manufactured by the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group, is operated with two replicas of the Hogwarts Express. The two directions of travel show two different videos. Because the trains transport guests between stations in two separate theme parks, riders must have an admission pass valid for both theme parks, with ticket inspectors checking prior to boarding. The Hogwarts Express soft- opened to the public on July 1, 2014, before officially opening seven days later along with the rest of the Diagon Alley expansion. The service was immediately popular and within one month of opening, one million journeys had been made. History Platform 9¬æ at King's Cross station next to Diagon Alley has a large roof based on alt=On the left is a red steam locomotive and three carriages, with steam drifting out above. On the right passengers queue behind barriers and signs that say \\"Hogwarts Express\\" and \\"Platform 9¬æ\\". Over both of these is a large cylindrical glass and steel roof. The idea of creating a Hogwarts Express-related element came from Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative. After the opening of the Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010, Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks. At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure. Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible from each other. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter- themed lands. Several means of transport were proposed for the connector before planners settled on the idea of the Hogwarts Express train. In early 2011, construction surveying was spotted in the Lost Continent section of Islands of Adventure, and the resort had begun surveying visitors about a possible expansion. This led to rumors that Universal Orlando was planning to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. At the end of the year, the resort announced the Jaws: The Ride would close on January 2, 2012, to make way for Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts. Almost two and a half years later, WESH-TV, the local NBC affiliate for the Orlando/Central Florida area, reported that an elevated track system had been installed at Universal Orlando and that the track ran between Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and a construction area in Universal Studios Florida. In May 2013, Universal Orlando announced the expansion of Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express train, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders were ready to be assembled on the track. The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013. The second train was placed on the track in early December 2013. On December 2, 2013, Orlando Attractions Magazine, an amusement park website, spotted one of the trains being tested. The resort previewed the interior of the Hogwarts Express in January 2014 through a live cast. In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations. The resort announced in June 2014 that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014. A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement. Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders had ridden the Hogwarts Express. It had taken approximately two and a half years to develop by a team of 150 people. Characteristics Trains pass over the Universal Orlando alt=The lower half of the photograph shows industrial office buildings, with a small label \\"T-4\\" in one corner. Above this runs a steel construction carrying an elevated rail system, with an emergency exit walkway. Mounted on the track is a red steam locomotive with two small wheels and three big wheels raised slightly above the track. Above the middle of the three big wheels is a curved sign that says \\"Hogwarts Castle\\". Under the train are sets of much smaller wheels resting directly on the track. It is only possible to ride the Hogwarts Express after having already entered either theme park and presenting a ticket that allows admission to both of them on the same day. The train carries 30,000 passengers per day, and operates 365 days per year. Track Hogwarts Express is a single-track elevated cable railway running over the backlot between the two theme parks, with a two-track passing loop at the midpoint. It is long and has a track gauge of . On the track, there is a haul rope and a counter rope, each with a diameter of . The cable winding motor is at King's Cross station and has a rated load of and a peak power rating of . Trains The Hogwarts Express uses two trains that can transport 168 passengers each, giving a total of 336 passengers per cycle. Each train is an articulated cable car formed of five sections: a replica of a steam locomotive and its tender plus a set of three passenger coaches each with seven passenger compartments. Each compartment holds up to eight seated passengers and has its own projection system instead of windows. Originally each train was planned to have two passenger coaches; the number was increased following a survey that suggested potential passengers saw the Hogwarts Express as an attraction rather than a means of transportation between the parks. The locomotive on the trains weigh , the tenders weigh , and each passenger carriage weighs . Because movement of the trains is controlled by cable from a one engine house, they depart and arrive at the end stations at the same time, and always reach the halfway point at the same time. The cable moves at the speed of .. On both trains, the locomotive faces towards Hogsmeade station; it is not possible for the trains to face King's Cross. As a result, the Hogwarts Express departs from Hogsmeade and enters King's Cross in reverse. At each station, the platforms are located on the left side of the trains. The trains are therefore only designed to be seen from one side; the other lacks the locomotives' false driving wheels and specific detailing. Over 70 percent of the cabling in the trains are for the show effects and physically animated components. The trains were built in Goldau, Switzerland. CWA Constructions designed both the exterior and interior of the trains to make them look as similar as possible to the Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the steam locomotive GWR Hall class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train. Frey AG was responsible for wiring the trains for the video and sound components. The company also installed other technical equipment that allows the trains to be controlled by a computer system. =Media= alt=Inside a 1950s-style train compartment. On the left is a window with a projected blue-green image behind it. On the right is a person watching the projection through the window. The compartment lights and sliding door are partially reflected in the glass. Each compartment has a curved screen where the window would be. There are two different videos, depending on the destination of the train. The special effects in both videos were by Double Negative. The London Symphony Orchestra recorded the music played throughout the journey at Abbey Road Studios on March 25, 2014. The music for the northbound journey is called \\"Connector Train ‚Äì Hogsmeade to London\\". Journey Theme park guests may use the Hogwarts Express to travel between Hogsmeade and King's Cross in London, close to Diagon Alley. They can travel in either direction as long as the guest has purchased a Park-to-Park ticket, Annual Pass, or Seasonal Pass, which gives guests access to both of Universal Orlando's theme parks within the same day. Two different videos are provided depending on the destination of the train, both of which are approximately four minutes long. King's Cross to Hogsmeade The King's Cross station is built on a site that previously held the Jaws attraction. The entrance to the station, which is a quarter-scale replica of London King's Cross railway station, is located in the London area, close to Diagon Alley. Passengers enter the station building and have their admission ticket checked. They then enter a queue which takes them farther into the station building, under a split-flap departure board, and past London-related advertisements, several stacks of suitcases and a shop selling British brands of food and drink. After ascending a flight of stairs, passengers find themselves between signs for King's Cross Platform 9 and Platform 10. They can see those ahead of them walking through the \\"wall\\" forming the entrance to Platform 9¬æ. This effect uses the Pepper's ghost illusion. After continuing around several corners, guests arrive on Platform 9¬æ to wait for the next train. After the Hogwarts Express has reversed into Platform 9¬æ and the arriving passengers have disembarked, the next passengers enter one of the twenty-one compartments in the three passenger coaches. As the train departs King's Cross, the video sequence in the compartments starts with Hedwig the owl flying alongside while passing through the outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger pass along the corridor side of the coach looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and the lights in the compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Rubeus Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers. Passengers then disembark from the train, walk down a ramp past the front of the Hogwarts Express and follow a path leading to Hogsmeade. Hogsmeade to King's Cross At the entrance of the queue, ticket inspectors check passengers' tickets for Universal Studios. The line then leads into a forested area which leads into the Hogsmeade station building. Upon climbing a flight of steps, travelers reach the Hogsmeade station platform. Once the arriving passengers on the Hogwarts Express have left the platform, passengers waiting may then board the train and enter one of the twenty-one passenger compartments within the train. As the train departs towards King's Cross, the video sequence in the compartments begins with Hagrid waving goodbye outside of the window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts can be seen in the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find themselves in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers. Passengers then disembark onto Platform 9¬æ of King's Cross and proceed down some stairs into a 2010-era King's Cross station, before arriving at the London waterfront area, adjacent to Diagon Alley.

The trolley contains a human-sized semi-transparent mirror that combines the foreground and background. Robert Niles from Theme Park Insider mentioned how the attraction \\"broke walls\\". Examples included the separation of the Wizarding and Muggle worlds; how Universal made the audience the performers (in the part of the King's Cross queue where guests walk through the wall leading to Platform 9¬æ). He wrote: \\"It's become convention for theme park attractions to drop you off at or very near the same point where you boarded the ride, so it's a bit disorienting when you exit the Hogwarts Express and find that you're not only in a different train station ‚Äî you're in a different theme park.\\" Arthur Levine from About.com was disappointed that Universal had not tried to re-create the magical aspect of guests entering Platform 9¬æ: \\"When it's time to make their own way to the platform, however, it appears to would-be wizards that they are merely entering a darkened corridor. Aside from an audible \\"whoosh\\" sound, there is, regrettably, no attempt to reproduce the magical, molecule-shifting phenomenon.\\" He also found it awkward that the Hogwarts Express reverses into Platform 9¬æ at King's Cross‚Äîalthough in Hogsmeade the train arrives facing forwards. Overall Levine said that the attraction does more than just making it a ride: \\"By making it an integral and compelling part of The Wizarding World, most guests would want to ride it to get the complete Potter experience. By making it an inter-park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to board it, Universal will surely help up-sell a lot more customers to higher- priced passes, encourage multi-day visits, increase demand for its on-property hotels, and drive business at its CityWalk dining/shopping/entertainment district\\". In 2014, attendance at Universal Studios Florida increased to 8.3 million visitors, compared to 7.1 million in the previous year. Attendance at Islands of Adventure did not change. According to vice president of AECOM's economics, Brian Sands, the attendance increase at the Studios was likely due to the Diagon Alley expansion. Sands also mentioned attendance at Islands of Adventure remained the same since \\"visitors go to the new thing\\", though the Hogwarts Express likely prevented attendance from decreasing at the park. Incidents * On October 1, 2016, a man and 14-year-old girl were treated for burn injuries after an e-cigarette exploded on the ride. * On August 17, 2017, both Hogwarts Express trains were evacuated outside of each station. Some passengers were stranded inside the vehicles for over an hour without ventilation. The incident happened again a week later, on August 24, 2017. Universal blamed \\"technical issues\\" for both incidents. See also * 2014 in amusement parks * The Jacobite (steam train) * Walt Disney World Railroad * Warner Bros.

His father was Richard Glover and his mother Mary Maria (Broeck) Booker. Glover practiced law for many years before entering government work, where he served as a clerk of court and as secretary to the Crown. Between 1700 and 1712 he was part of the Executive Council, serving either as a member or as chairman. During this time at the council, certain people became hostile towards him. Between 1706 and 1707, while Thomas Cary was in South Carolina, Glover governed North Carolina in his place. In October of that year, John Porter, who was responsible for formally dismissing Thomas Cary, elected new members of the council. Glover who had been acting as governor, was formally elected to the position. However Cary and Glover were never able to resolve their problems. Glover believed that Quakers should not be able to hold office, so he advocated for the swearing of an oath for every government position. This prevented Quakers from taking up any government position because their religion prevented them from swearing oaths. However, in the summer of 1708, Porter called a meeting of councilors, both those who held that job at the time & those who had done it before, and declared the election of Glover as illegal. Porter decided to support Cary after Glover attempted to prevent Quakers from attaining public office. This resulted in Cary/Glover both trying to occupy governmental power, causing turmoil in North Carolina. In October 1708, they tried to resolve their conflict in the assembly. However, Cary's supporters controlled the assembly and elected him as governor. Glover then moved to Virginia alleging that Cary wanted to kill him. Glover served as a trustee between 1711 and 1712 under Governor Edward Hyde, who supported Cary. Taking advantage of continuing tensions among Anglicans (supported by Glover) & dissidents (supported by Cary), Cary's Rebellion against Glover was waged.NCpedia: WILLIAM GLOVER.

This species is closely related to Sphaerosyllis bifurcata, Sphaerosyllis bifurcatoides and Sphaerosyllis rotundipapillata, all endemic species to Australia, characterized by having large dorsal papillae, sometimes trilobed, and with shafts of compound chaetae distally bifid. S. voluntariorum is more densely papillated on its anterior segments and has a long subdistal spine on the ventral simple chaetae. This species' name alludes to the volunteers of the Marine Invertebrate section of The Australian Museum, who sorted specimens of syllids that led to the description of this animal. Description The species' body is small, with a total length of and width of , including 26 chaetigers. It possesses numerous papillae on its dorsum and a few on its parapodia, and none on its prostomium and palps; the papillae are long, with trilobed tips and dark inclusions. Its prostomium is ovate, showing 4 large eyes in a trapezoidal arrangement. Its antennae are long, with bulbous bases and long tips, similar to the combined length of its prostomium and palps. The palps are similar in length than its prostomium, fused along their length, ventrally folded. Its peristomium measures the same as its succeeding segments, covering the posterior half of the prostomium. Its tentacular cirri are shorter than its antennae, the dorsal cirri being the same length as the tentacular cirri, with slender tips. Its parapodial lobes are conical, with 2 subdistal papillae. Its ventral cirri are long and slender, while its parapodial glands are very small. It shows anterior parapodia with 5 compound chaetae each, with unidentate blades. The blades of the dorsal compound chaetae possess marginal spines about 12¬µm long, while the blades of ventral compound chaetae are smooth, measuring about 9 ¬µm long.

She was armed with eighteen 4-pounder guns and had a burthen of 172 tons (bm). She took part in one notable action before she was lost in a collision with the 74-gun . Spiders commander was Acting-Lieutenant James Oswald, and she served in the squadron under Admiral Adam Duncan off the Texel where she performed reconnaissance duties.Duncan (1898), p. 38. On 13 August 1795 Spider captured the \\"Neutral Vessel\\" Maria , suggesting that she was already on active duty in advance of the formal contract. Two days later Oswald discovered the Dutch fleet some 9‚Äì10 miles NW of Camperdown, and reported that fact and the number and types of vessels to Duncan on 17 August.Duncan (1898), p. 48-49. When Admirals Duncan and Pringle set out after the Dutch, together with a Russian squadron, they found that the Dutch had returned to port.Scots Magazine; Or, General Repository of Literature, History... (September 1795), Vol. 57, p.284. Spiders greatest moment occurred on 25 August. Spider sighted and engaged two French Navy brigs off the Texel until the squadron's larger vessels could come up. Once the French brigs had struck, Spider took possession of one of them. One brig was Suffisante, of fourteen 8 and 6-pounder guns, and the other was Victorieuse, of fourteen 12-pounder guns. They were heading into the North Sea on a cruise. French records show that Suffisantes captain was lieutenant de vaisseau Nosten, and state that her actual captors were the 74-gun third-rate , the frigate , and the lugger Speedy.Fonds Marine, p.116. Apparently, Suffisante exchanged fire with the 20-gun lugger Speedy, but the arrival on the scene of Mars and Venus rendered further resistance futile.Troude (1867), Vol. 2, p.455. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Suffisante. Victorieuses commander was lieutenant de vaisseau Salaun. The captors of Victorieuse were Duncan's flagship , , and a frigate. Victorieuse too joined the Royal Navy, becoming HMS Victorieuse and serving until broken up in 1805. Courts martial acquitted both Nosten and Salaun of the loss of their vessels. On 28 August Duncan wrote he had promoted Oswald to Lieutenant and confirmed him in command of Spider.Duncan (1898), p. 52. Duncan's squadron, including Spider, shared the prize money, which was ready for payment in April 1796. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the one surviving claimant from the action the Naval General Service Medal with clasp: \\"Spider 25 Augt 1795\\". When Admiral Duncan rendezvoused in the Downs with his fleet, on 8 January 1806, Spider, Daniel Falara, master, was sent to Guernsey to smuggle articles for the fleet, such as wine, spirits, hair powder, playing cards, etc. When she arrived at the Downs she started to unload her contraband cargo for the various ships but a customs and excise boat, William Wallace, master, followed her in and seized her. Customs found crates addressed to Duncan, William Pitt the Younger, and Henry Dundas. A few days later Wallace was ordered to release Spider and her cargo or lose his job.Bradlaugh et al. (1858), p.284. On 4 April 1796, Ramilies ran down and sank Spider. The fleet was tacking and Spiders master claimed that one of the larger ships had taken the wind out of her sails.Hepper (1994), p. 80. Duncan, in writing of the loss, however, states that Oswald had run her aground in a chase. He further remarked that although Oswald would have to undergo the \\"Ceremony of a Court Martial for the loss of his Lugger\\", Oswald was a promising officer deserving of encouragement and further command. Oswald did go on to rise to the rank of post captain.Duncan (1898), p. 344-5.

Keesing (January 5, 1902 ‚Äì April 1961) was a New Zealand-born anthropologist who specialized in the study of the Philippine Islands and the South Pacific. He came to the United States in the 1940s and taught at Stanford University, California, 1942‚Äì1961. He and Marie Margaret Martin Keesing, also an anthropologist, were married in July 1928. They had two sons, economist Donald Beaumont Keesing (1933‚Äì2004) and Roger Martin Keesing (1935‚Äì1993), who also became an anthropologist. Early life and family Felix Keesing was born in Taiping, Perak, in what was then British Malaya, on January 5, 1902. Known to his friends as ‚ÄúFee,‚Äù Keesing graduated from Auckland University College in 1926 with first-class honors in education. He was soon engaged to marry Marie Martin. During their engagement, setting a pattern they would follow throughout their lives, Marie collaborated with him as he rewrote his Master‚Äôs thesis for the 1928 publication The Changing Maori (Thomas Avery & Son). Marie was not acknowledged as a co-author but described as a co-interlocutor, collaborator and companion. The family lived in Chicago, New Haven, London, Honolulu, Washington DC, before settling at Stanford University in 1942. The Keesings took American citizenship in 1940s. Felix Keesing died of a heart attack during a game of tennis in April 1961 at Stanford. Marie Keesing died three months later, on July 13, 1961. Career and impact Felix Keesing earned his A.B. in 1924, his master's degree in 1925, and Litt. D in 1934 from the University of New Zealand. As a teenager, he had visited the United States on a scholarship as an artist. In Chicago he sketched life in poor neighborhoods and decided to become an anthropologist in order to understand why people behaved in the ways they did. After his marriage in 1928, he received support from the Rockefeller Foundation to study first at the University of Chicago, then Yale University. in 1930 Keesing was appointed to head a research project of the Institute of Pacific Relations that explored the Dependencies and Native Peoples of the Pacific. He published works on American Samoa and the Philippines for the project before going to the London School of Economics in 1933, then to University of Hawaii in 1934. He stayed in Hawaii for three years. In the 1930s, the Keesings also pursued research among the Menominee Indians of Wisconsin. Their 1939 study, The Menomini Indians of Wisconsin, reported that many features of Native American cultures that anthropologists had assumed to be \\"aboriginal\\" were in fact produced by interaction with European societies. At the time, however, the study did not received the attention it deserved, probably because the field of anthropology did not yet appreciate the role of historical change in peoples they regarded as primitive.Wilcomb E. Washburn, Bruce Trigger, \\"Native Peoples in Euro-American Historiography,\\" in Trigger, Washburn, et. al., eds., The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 100. On the even of World War II, Keesing's The South Seas in the Modern World (1941) set out to \\"define comprehensively the political, strategic, and economic role the Oceanic islands play in the world today, and especially the modern experience and problems of the people native to them.\\" p. xiii. quoted in Keesing put his anthropological knowledge to work as the principal advisor on the South Pacific to the Office of War Information, which gathered intelligence and prepared briefings for the American military. The Keesings came to Stanford in 1942 to participate in a training program for the United States Army, and Felix subsequently trained naval officers for service in the South Pacific. These programs continued his activities in the field of applied anthropology, that is, using scholarly knowledge for training and policy analysis. After the war, Keesing remained at Stanford, and became head of the Department of Anthropology. In addition to carrying out several missions to the South Pacific for the American government, Keesing published prolifically and was especially known for his studies of culture change.

The company originally started out as Clover Electronic Amusement in 1968, then became Taito of Brazil in 1972 by Abraham \\"Abba\\" Kogan, the son of the founder of the parent company Taito located in Japan. This subsidiary was originally an importer of existing U.S. and Japanese machine components to be assembled within the country. However, the taxation on imports had been growing steadily, and the government's belief that pinball is a game of chance and considered a gambling machine, led to strict import rules. By 1976, within rules created by the Electronic Processing Activities Coordinating Committee (CAPRE), it became illegal to import pinball machines. This created a problem, since the popularity of arcade games in Brazil had been growing exponentially for many years. In 1978, with an influx of cash from the parent company, Taito of Brazil was able to build new facilities to accommodate the new standard of electronic solid state games being produced by other manufacturers. Because of the import changes, companies in Brazil needed to become innovative, and began creating imitations, or close representations of already existing products that could no longer be acquired. This included pinball and arcade games. Taito of Brazil began creating games by copying existing designs of successful pinball machines made elsewhere. Where some games were nearly identical in a physical sense, others had greatly altered artwork. In most cases of games created to look like their counterparts made by other manufacturers, the machine name was changed, sound effects altered, and often went through a modification of game rules. Such was the case with a Taito-made game called, Oba Oba. The playfield layout was a copy of Bally Playboy but with altered artwork, and now based on a playhouse located in Rio de Janeiro. Where others were much closer to the original games, such as the case with Drakor, which is nearly identical to Gorgar from Williams Electronics. Taito of Brazil's most commercially successful pinball machine was Cosmic, a clone of Stern Electronics Galaxy. Additionally, starting in the late 1970s, Taito of Brazil began creating arcade game clones known as bootlegs as well. The only hardware available to them was an arcade board originally created by Japanese company, Nichibutsu for a game called, Moon Cresta (1980). Bootleg versions of existing games were altered to run on this hardware. Other minor changes were implemented to the software code including text, and sound effects. In total, 21 different adaptations had been produced, including popular games such as, Zig Zag, a redeployment of Dig Dug from Namco, and Missile X, a clone of Missile Command from Atari. Taito of Brazil closed its doors in 1985 after a series of unfortunate events. Michael Kogan, the founder of the parent company, Taito Corporation had died on a business trip to the U.S. in early 1984. This left much of the control of the Japanese Taito Corporation to the company employees, who were less enthusiastic about its subsidiaries. This added to a sharp decrease in the popularity of pinball worldwide as the result of the popularity of arcade video games prompted the decision to close down Taito of Brazil in 1985. The company was liquidated and all its debts honored without the need for bankruptcy. Kyocera of Japan purchased what remained of the Taito Corporation in 1986.

He went on to become one of the most famous metallurgist of his time in the Soviet Union. When the Institute of Solid State Physics was established on February 15, 1963, he was one of the main organizers of the institute. Early days Georgii Kurdyumov was born on February 14, 1902 in Rylsk, Kursk Province, Russian Empire. His father was a priest. He trained as a physicist at the Ioffe Institute in Saint Petersburg. As a young scientist, he took interest in metallurgy and after obtaining his diploma, he was one of the 220 Soviet Union scientists who were allowed to spend time abroad. He went to Germany, and worked with George Sachs in Berlin. Their collaboration resulted in Kurdyumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation. Career After he moved back to the Soviet Union, he went to Ukraine and became one of the founders of the Dnepropetrovsk Physico-Technical Institute in Dnipropetrovsk. He was appointed director of the institute. After the Second World War, he and the institute moved to Moscow. He was Director of the Institute for Physical Metallurgy of the Central Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy in Moscow from 1944 to 1978. He also helped to establish the Laboratory for Metal Physics in Ukraine. The Laboratory for Metal Physics was founded on November 15, 1945, by the All-Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (now the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). From 1945 to 1951, he was the head of the laboratory. Today it has been renamed as G. V. Kurdyumov Institute for Metal Physics. The Institute of Solid State Physics was established by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences) on February 15, 1963; he, together with Yuri Osipyan and Cheslav Kopetsky, were the main organizers of institute. He also supervised the PhD thesis of Osipyan. He was a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He made major contributions to the development of physical metallurgy. He performed pioneering work in the study of martensitic transformation in crystalline materials that are of fundamental importance for the theory of phase transitions and heat treatment of steels and alloys. He was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor (March 13, 1969), five Orders of Lenin (1954, 1962, 1969, 1975 and 1982), the Order of the October Revolution (1972), and two Orders of the Red Banner (1945 and 1958).

Orphaned at a young age, she found encouragement from her childhood neighbor Miguel √Ångel Asturias for her literary dreams. After graduating from the country's Teacher's College, she taught school at a private academy and began to publish poems. Though her husband was part of dictator Jorge Ubico Casta√±eda's cabinet, they became enemies and Efra√≠n Aguilar Fuentes, her husband, was arrested and shot. She was briefly arrested as well and ostracized by many. She was an ardent feminist and became outspoken about political issues after the fall of Ubico's government. She was the biographer of Gabriela Mistral and one of the first female erotic poets of Central America. Biography Magdalena Sp√≠nola Stecker was born on 26 December 1896 in Guatemala to Rafael Sp√≠nola Orellana and Florencia Strecker Fr√≠as Her mother died when she was four years old and a year later her father died. She and her sister, Stella were then split up as well, with Stella going to live with her maternal grandparents and Magdalena sent to live with her paternal grandparents. Sp√≠nola's neighbor was Miguel √Ångel Asturias, who became her childhood friend and with whom she discussed an awakening love of literature. Asturias would later dedicate his first book to her. Sp√≠nola began her schooling at the Dolores y Jes√∫s Mu√±os Kindergarten and then attended the Colegio \\"Central de Se√±oritas\\" under the tutelage of Concepci√≥n Saravia de Ziri√≥n. She was surprised to discover that her textbook prologue had been written by her father. After a time, she changed schools and began attending Colegio de Se√±oritas San Rosa. Completing her secondary education, Sp√≠nola enrolled in teacher's college at the Instituto Normal Central para Se√±oritas Bel√©n graduating with her teaching credentials. She got a job at a private school Colegio \\"Josefina Gonz√°lez\\" for the 1914‚Äì1915 term. Early writing efforts In 1915, Sp√≠nola wrote her first story, entitled Nubia and sent it to Revista Guatemala Informativa, where it was reviewed and accepted by Carlos Wyld Ospina, Virgilio Rodr√≠guez Beteta and M√°ximo Soto Hall. Buoyed, by her success, she submitted pieces to La Rep√∫blica, Revista La Esfera and the prestigious newspaper Quetzaltenango, but soon writing took a back seat as she and Efra√≠n Aguilar Fuentes married and began their family. She quickly had five children, but lost a pair of twins and a baby, leaving her with her daughter, Lilian Eugenia, the oldest, and a son, Rafael, named after her father. Under the presidency of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, Aguilar's family was persecuted and pushed into exile, first to El Salvador, then Honduras, and finally to Nicaragua. He settled in the city of Le√≥n, Nicaragua and enrolled in the university there. Sp√≠nola, who did not accompany him in exile, revived her literary efforts and other tasks to stay busy. In 1925, inspired by successes in suffrage by women in England, France, and United States Sp√≠nola joined with Romelia Alarc√≥n, Laura Bendfeldt, Mar√≠a Albertina G√°lvez, Clemencia de Herrarte, Gloria Men√©ndez Mina, Adriana de Palarea, and Graciela Quan to form the Comit√© Pro-Ciudadan√≠a to fight for Guatemalan women's suffrage. Then in 1927, she began writing poetry again beginning with a poem entitled \\"Amanecida\\". She published works regularly in the newspapers El D√≠a and Diario de Guatemala and the magazines Eco and Mercurio. Two years later in 1929 she competed in the poetry competition Juegos Florales organized by the Asociaci√≥n de Periodistas y Escritores de Nicaragua. She won the prize but was stripped of it because they claimed it could not be given to foreign writers. She was disappointed, but entered another contest in December 1929 and won the prize and a monetary award, allowing her to spend Christmas in Le√≥n with her husband. Her submission was a patriotic piece, Amad a la Patria (Love for the homeland). Three months later, on 27 March 1930, Aguilar graduated with his doctorate in law and returned to Guatemala, joining the cabinet of the newly elected president, Jorge Ubico Casta√±eda. Sp√≠nola had become a collaborator with the newspaper La Noticia and the magazine El Gr√°fico de Guatemala and life fell into a productive pattern with her writing several hours every day. Treason, murder and redemption The calm didn't last. President Ubico announced that he was running for re-election. Aguilar spoke out against it, as it was against the constitution and the two became enemies. Because of an alleged or actual plot, he and others were arrested and shot, Sp√≠nola was imprisoned briefly as well and even after her release was shunned by friends and family. She found solace from writing and returned to teaching, working at the Colegio San Sebasti√°n, founded by Monse√±or Mariano Rosell y Arellano in 1936 and 1937. In 1937, she wrote El pre√°mbulo de la maestra and published several poems in the leading woman's magazine of the era, Nosotras. Sp√≠nola participated in a 1938 anthology called Colecci√≥n lila with Angelina Acu√±a, Olga Violeta Luna de Marroqu√≠n, and Mar√≠a del Pilar de Garcia, which was Central America's first women's poetry collection, both written and published by women. The pieces Sp√≠nola included in the volume were laments of love lost, physical longing and have hints that she may have been criticizing the government in the only way possible in the highly censored climate. In 1942, Sp√≠nola won a literary prize from the weekly journal Verbum for her \\"Sonetos del amor eucar√≠stico\\". With the student revolts, overturn of the Ubico dictatorship and elections of 1944, Sp√≠nola's writing took on a more confrontational tone and she openly began to criticize the government and speak of feminism. Her husband was vindicated and elevated to the status as a hero by the leaders of the 1944 revolution. Increasingly she took on political roles and in 1944 alone, she accepted the presidency of the Association of Intellectual Women of Guatemala; became the secretary for the Guatemalan chapter of the Union of American Women (Uni√≥n de Mujeres Americanas); and became a board member for both the Alliance for Citizenship of Guatemalan Women and the Social Democratic Party. She also released a poem \\"Eleg√≠a del que cay√≥\\" publicly rebuking Ubico's execution of her husband. In 1946, the government authorized a printing of 1,500 copies of a poetry collection called \\"Alondra\\", but though she needed the money, Sp√≠nola did not follow through as she was unsatisfied with the quality of the poems. Throughout the 1940s she remained political, joining several organizations promoting peace, women's rights, and in favor of a Palestinian state. Later career In the early 1950s, Sp√≠nola's son Rafael became a diplomat and had several posts throughout South America. Sp√≠nola took advantage of the opportunity to travel, visiting Chile in 1954 and Peru between 1955 and 1956. During these travels she published pieces in various newspapers in Guatemala, especially travel commentaries like \\"Desde Santiago de Chile\\" and \\"Desde la Ciudad de los Reyes\\" which were published in El Imparcial. For many years, she had kept up a correspondence with the writer Carlos Wyld Ospina, which began in the 1940s. They became engaged in the 1950s and planned to marry, but Wyld died in 1956, before they formalized their relationship. In 1956, Sp√≠nola was honored by a group of Honduran poets and she traveled to Tegucigalpa to lecture about Gabriela Mistral for the group \\"Ideas\\". In 1958 she received a certificate of merit from her alma mater, Bel√©n and in 1959 a similar acknowledgment from the Association of Guatemalan Journalists. In 1960, she won the first prize at the Day of the Americas celebration with the work Gabriela Mistral o la madre- maestra cantora. The 1960s were a busy time as she lectured, wrote newspaper articles and critiques of Guatemalan literature, and traveled. She performed her poetry as well, sometimes in recitals and regularly read them on the radio. In 1967, Sp√≠nola was diagnosed with a uterine tumor which proved to be malignant. She had surgery and traveled to Chile to rest and recuperate. She was able to realize a dream in 1968, when her first book Gabriela Mistral: hu√©sped de honor de su patria was published in Chile, with a preface by her childhood friend Miguel √Ångel Asturias. She returned from Chile in 1971 for a reunion in the United States with her sister, Stella. But that event was marred when she learned that her daughter Lilian was seriously ill. In April, Lilian died from leukemia and those who knew her said it was the first time grief seemed to defeat Sp√≠nola who had lost her parents, husband, three other children, her lover and now her daughter. That same year she received the Gold Medal Francisco M√©ndez for her contributions to national literature, but she was too grief-stricken to stay in Guatemala and fled back to Chile and her son, Rafael. In 1977, she published her first collection of poems, Tr√°nsito l√≠rico: poemas. In 1981, Horacio Figueroa Marroqu√≠n, published a book called Las nueve musas del parnaso guatemalense, in which he named Sp√≠nola one of the nine muses of Guatemala. A few months later, she was awarded the Order of Dolores Bedoya de Molina with the degree of Silver Star by President Lucas Garc√≠a. In 1984, Clara Luz Meneses A. de Soto published Sp√≠nola's biography. Her last years were spent in the company of her grandchildren who had formed the rock band Alux Nahual. In 1990, Sp√≠nola's son Rafael died and a few months later, her sister Stella died. Magdalena Sp√≠nola Stecker de Aguilar outlived them all, dying on 7 January 1991.

One of only two feature-length films directed by Madison, she also played the leading role, a fervent labor organizer who uses drastic methods to finance her cause of improving the miserable lot of the workers in a factory. The film is presumed lost. Synopsis Factory worker Rethna (Madison) comes from an impoverished background. Her raison d'√™tre is to improve the miserable lot of her fellow workers; her chief foe is the cruel factory-owner. Rethna begins a sexual relationship with Henry Burke (William Mong), the owner's disreputable son, and obtains money from him which she funnels to the workers, doing with Burke's money what she believes the Burkes ought to be doing anyway. After a year, she breaks off her relationship with Henry and marries his brother Walter (Edward Hearn), the better man of the two. She continues to support the factory workers with Burke money, and is eventually found out by her husband. Confronted by Walter, who truly loves her, she tells him that she married him only to gain access to his money and avenge the wrongs done by his family; faced with this admission, Walter leaves Rethna. While Rethna is at the factory pleading with her father-in-law for better working conditions, a fire breaks out. Rethna is badly burned while saving the elder Burke's life, and is herself saved by Walter. During her convalescence she realizes that she loves her husband and the two are reconciled.

C. Chandor. Chandor and Mark Boal wrote the screenplay based on a story by Boal. The film stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal as a group of former U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers who reunite to plan a heist of a South American crime lord. The film was released by Netflix in theaters on March 6, 2019, before a worldwide streaming release on March 13, 2019. It received generally favorable reviews from critics. Plot Santiago \\"Pope\\" Garcia works as a private military adviser in Colombia combating drug crime. During his time there, an informant named Yovanna asks for his help with smuggling her and her brother out of the country in exchange for information on the whereabouts of a drug lord named Lorea. Yovanna tells Pope that Lorea lives in a safe house in the jungle along with all his cash. Pope travels home to the States to recruit his old Delta Force friends for a job to seize the money under the pretense of working for the Colombian government: Tom \\"Redfly\\" Davis, a realtor; William \\"Ironhead\\" Miller, a motivational speaker; his brother Ben Miller, a mixed martial arts fighter; and Francisco \\"Catfish\\" Morales, a former pilot. With persuasion from Pope, they decide to steal the money for themselves. The group, wanting to minimize casualties, devises a plan to move in on the house while Lorea's family is at church. They quietly subdue the guards, without killing them, but cannot find Lorea or the money. Pope realises that the money is in the walls, and the team begin bagging the money. They realize that there is far more than they expected and rush to get as much as possible before Lorea's family and guards return. Redfly becomes consumed by the money and demands the crew continue loading it past the hard stop that he himself set. This alarms the crew, who finally convince him that they are out of time, and must leave immediately. With the money safely loaded in the truck, they make one last sweep for Lorea. As they search for Lorea, he ambushes them and wounds Ironhead, before being killed by Pope. As the crew tends to Ironhead's wounds, and now several minutes past their getaway time, some guards return. The crew take them out, burn down the house, and escape in the van, driving by Lorea's family returning from church. They meet up with Yovanna and her brother with $250 million dollars in the van, and then rendezvous with Ironhead's old friend who provides them a private Mi-8MTV-1 transport helicopter for their voyage to reach their getaway boat that would aide to their escape from South America. From there, they would transfer the money to an account in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda. Catfish is skeptical that the helicopter can hold the weight of all the money at high altitudes as they have to fly over the Andes Mountains in order to make it to the meeting point. Unwilling to leave behind any of the money, Redfly urges Catfish to proceed. The crew takes off with the money in a net bag attached under the helicopter. They transport Yovanna into Peru with her brother. Redfly aggressively questions her knowledge of them, knowing she could link them to the robbery. Before leaving, Pope leaves Yovanna and her brother with a share of the stolen money and visas to Sydney, Australia, and urges them to leave South America as soon as possible to avoid being caught by the gangsters. As the group takes off, an unsatisfied Redfly claims that Yovanna was lying to him but Pope talks him down. Redfly insinuates that they should have killed her, prompting Ironhead to convince Redfly that doing so would lead to circumstances he would not recover from. Fixated on the money, Redfly becomes more and more willing to break his own rules and do whatever is necessary to escape with the money. As planned, the crew begin flying over the Andes Mountains. However as they are reaching the helicopter's maximum ceiling, one of the helicopter's gearboxes is overwhelmed and damaged due to the cargo load exceeding the maximum weight, causing their helicopter to enter a rapid descent. Unable to recover from their descent, Catfish urges the team to release the money bag via manual override to allow for a safe crash landing. The group survives the crash landing and exit the helicopter wreck with minor injuries and quickly move into action. Redfly and Pope attempt to retrieve the ditched money bag, which landed in a cocaine farm field village, by negotiating with the local farmers and villagers that are seen rummaging through the bag. The wounded Ironhead stands by at the wreckage while Catfish and Ben take position and recon the activity through bushes. Their attempts to peacefully retrieve the money fails due to a heated confrontation arising as the farmers mistaken the group as DEA agents and view them as hostile upon noticing the other armed group members in the distance. When one of the angry farmers gets defensive and approaches with a machete, Redfly draws out his pistol and kills him and several others, prompting the other villagers to back away from the money bag. While Catfish, Ironhead, and William prepare a group of mules to transport the money, Pope and Redfly compensate the village elder with some of the stolen money. Upon reaching an agreement, they continue their voyage to the meeting point. The crew eventually set the mules free once the terrain becomes too treacherous. When they reach the top of the mountain and make their way down, a firefight takes place with two villagers seeking to avenge the deaths of their families. Redfly takes one of them out before being killed by a single shot from the second villager‚Äôs rifle. Pope takes out the second shooter and the crew mourn Redfly's death. After a brief argument between Ben and Ironhead, Pope urges them on stating that both Redfly's family and they themselves deserve the money at this point. They proceed towards the ocean with the money and Redfly's body. Ben scouts ahead and reports that their getaway boat is still waiting for them but the village is filled with armed teens waiting for them. While Pope initially argues that they \\"go through\\" the armed teens, the others vehemently disagree. They have come to realize they have sacrificed everything they believe in for the money, including their integrity. Pope becomes remorseful of his desire to kill the teenagers and takes it back. Knowing they cannot sneak all the money through the town, they toss the money into a ravine, keeping only what they can carry in their own backpacks. They attempt to quietly make their way through the town to the boat carrying Redfly's body, but are discovered. A car chase ensues and Pope hesitates to kill any more people, instead shooting the tires of the pursuers, causing their car to swerve into the sand. The team makes it to safety in the boat with 5 million dollars and Redfly's body. At the offshore account in St. John's, a lawyer provides paperwork disseminating the funds evenly between the 4 men and Redfly's family trust. However, the guilt- ridden men each agree in turn to give their shares to Redfly's family. Afterwards, the team go their separate ways with Pope planning to head to Australia to find Yovanna. Before leaving, Ironhead gives Pope a set of coordinates scribbled on a piece of paper, the location of the ravine in Peru where they left the money behind.

In November 2010, Hanks officially was cast. Production lagged, and, in June 2015, it was announced that Chandor was in talks to direct the film for Paramount Pictures, while Bigelow left because she wanted to focus on her film about Bowe Bergdahl (ultimately dropped in favor of Detroit). Both Hanks and Will Smith were in talks for the lead roles. The film, alternately titled Sleeping Dogs, would be produced by Roven and Alex Gartner through Atlas Entertainment. In September 2015, Chandor officially signed on to direct the film. On January 20, 2016, it was reported that Depp was again in early talks to star in it, while Hanks' attachment was yet to be confirmed, and Smith had left due to scheduling conflicts filming Collateral Beauty. In January 2017, it was reported that Channing Tatum and Tom Hardy were in talks to join the film, with Depp and Hanks no longer up for roles. In February 2017, Mahershala Ali joined the cast, with Tatum and Hardy also officially signed on. On April 12, 2017, a month before shooting was set to commence, it was reported that Triple Frontier had been dropped by Paramount, and Tatum and Hardy no longer would be a part of the cast, while Ali and Arjona were still attached to star. On May 1, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was in negotiations to acquire the rights to the film with Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck in negotiations for the roles Hardy and Tatum vacated, with Ali and Arjona remaining on the project. Ben Affleck exited the film in early July 2017, for personal reasons. On July 26, 2017, it was reported that Mark Wahlberg was in talks to join the film in the role Affleck vacated, along with Hunnam, Hedlund, and Pascal, with Arjona still attached to the project. Principal production was set to commence in August 2017, in Hawaii and Colombia. On March 19, 2018, it was announced that Triple Frontier would commence principal production on March 26, 2018, in Oahu, Hawaii. Ben Affleck had signed back on to star, cast with Isaac, Hunnam, Hedlund, Pascal, and Arjona. Ali had been forced to drop out of the project when production was delayed. The film's name, Triple Frontier, refers to the Tres Fronteras area of South America, which is known for its high levels of trafficking in drugs and contraband. Disasterpeace composed the film score. The soundtrack was released by Milan Records. Release The film had its world premiere in New York City on March 3, 2019. It was released in select theaters on March 6, before its worldwide Netflix release a week later on March 13. On April 16, 2019, Netflix announced that the film had been viewed by over 52 million viewers on its service within its first month of release. On July 5, 2019, Netflix announced that the film had been viewed by over 63 million viewers since its release on the service. In July 2020, it was revealed that the film had been watched by over 63 million viewers since its release on Netflix. Critical response On the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 6.32/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An outstanding cast and ambitious story help Triple Frontier overcome an uneven narrative‚Äîand elevate the end result above a crowded field of grim and gritty heist thrillers.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and writing: \\"From the direction to the script to the production elements to the performances, Triple Frontier is a first-class ride. Entertainment Weeklys Chris Nashawaty gave the film a \\"B\\" and wrote that \\"suffice it to say that Chandor, Boal, and their gruff band of he-men never let things slacken. There may be no honor among thieves, but Triple Frontier certainly makes watching them pretty entertaining.\\"  References   External links  * 2010s action adventure films 2010s heist films English-language films American films American action adventure films American heist films English-language Netflix original films Atlas Entertainment films Films directed by J.

'I think it‚Äôs a return to the sort of more \\"classic\\" Blitzen Trapper thing, for sure,' [songwriter Eric] Earley says.\\" Earley also elaborated on the songwriting process: \\"Those two albums [Furr and American Goldwing], I wrote all the songs at once and they all hang together. But the records that came in between, they were written over the course of a year-and-a-half or so ... For All Across This Land, he continues, ‚ÄúI had all the songs written and demoed in a three or four month span. And I think they work together because everything came in such a short period.‚Äù Pre-release In April 2015, the band premiered one of the new tracks from the album, \\"Rock N' Roll Was Made for You,\\" at a show supporting the recent Live Harvest album. Band member Marty Marquis indicated that more of the record would be previewed in tour dates leading up to the release of the record; later, website Missoulian confirmed this, reporting, \\"Fans attending Wednesday's show can expect to hear tracks from both albums [Live Harvest and All Across This Land] sprinkled into the band's live set.\\" Following the show, the official Twitter account of the band verified that several of the songs played the previous night were cuts from the new record: \\"Lonesome Angel,\\" \\"Rock N Roll Was Made For You,\\" \\"Mystery & Wonder,\\" \\"Across the River,\\" and \\"All Across This Land.\\" In February 2015, producer Gregg Williams released an in-studio snippet of Eric Earley recording a guitar solo for the new song, \\"Mystery & Wonder,\\" recorded at The Trench Studios. In July 2015, both the band's American label, Vagrant Records and their British label Lojinx published a press release for All Across This Land, highlighting the songwriting and craft of the new record: \\"Blitzen Trapper may have experimented successfully with a multitude of styles; however, the band has been built on a strong foundation as, above all else, a ROCK band. Their live shows consistently reinforce that fact, and those who have experienced their performance would agree. All Across This Land once again confirms that Blitzen Trapper possess the unique ability to create thoughtful, melodic, finely crafted songs on one hand, and deliver full throttle, infectious rock on the other. From the opening riff of the title track and first single, this is quite evident as it unfolds into a flurry of guitars, bass and drums. The band eases back as well by featuring some of lead singer and songwriter Eric Earley‚Äôs strongest writing yet, particularly on the semi-autobiographical 'Mystery and Wonder.' The track‚Äôs reflective and nostalgic tone was inspired by the band‚Äôs beginnings, the chemistry that develops over time and the music they have created through the years. Another album highlight is ‚ÄúLonesome Angel‚Äù with its easy ‚Äò70‚Äôs AM radio feel. \\"While All Across This Land features some of Earley‚Äôs finest songs to date, the rest of his bandmate‚Äôs performances ‚Äì Erik Menteer (guitar), Michael Van Pelt (bass), Marty Marquis (guitar/keys), Brian Adrian Koch (drums) ‚Äì elevate each track thus taking Blitzen Trapper to their highest artistic peak yet.\\" To accompany the press release, both labels also offered an album trailer for the new record; four days later, Lojinx and Vagrant confirmed the release and made a free download of album track \\"Lonesome Angel\\" available. On August 13, 2015, website PopMatters released a preview of the album's title track, \\"All Across This Land,\\" with an accompanying \\"visualette,\\" stating that the song is \\"a return to the sunny, riff-oriented classic rock sounds the band has excelled at for so long ... [t]apping into the sun-dappled sounds of early-1970s blues rock, classic Laurel Canyon rock, and of course the perpetual influence of Neil Young and Crazy Horse.\\" The web version of pop culture magazine Entertainment Weekly premiered the entire album as a stream on September 25th, 2015, and quoted singer/songwriter Eric Earley about the origins of the album: \\"I just went back to the bands that influenced me in high school, like the Replacements and R.E.M., Uncle Tupelo.\\" Earley also highlighted the lingering impact of his father's death on the record, saying, \\"He‚Äôs been gone for many years, but I wondered if I ever really knew him ... Who‚Äôs to say meditating on the thought, ‚ÄòWhat if I was to just cross over? Just to talk to my dad?‚Äô isn‚Äôt real?\\" On September 28th, 2015, media review/commentary site The A.V. Club premiered the first full-length music video for the album - the title track, \\"All Across This Land\\" - directed by Alicia J. Rose. The video imagines the band in various stages of recent rock-and-roll history, regressing from the CD era, back through cassettes, 8-track, and finally vinyl records. Says A.V. Club's Dave Anthony, \\"the album sees the band return to the classic-rock strut of its Sub Pop years, with riffs that go full-on Southern rock ... [in] the video for the album‚Äôs title track ... the band dons a few different get-ups that reference various eras of rock history [and] rides around in the back of a well-painted van, it takes in the sights and sounds of the country, then let them spill out in 'All Across This Land.'\\" As part of a unique promotion of both the vinyl record and independent music stores, the band hand-designed 100 copies of the vinyl album and shipped them to stores all over the country. From the Blitzen Trapper website: \\"In conjunction with the release of the new album on October 2nd, 100 select independent record stores in the US will each have one copy of All Across This Land on vinyl with sleeves hand-designed, autographed and numbered by the band. Head in to your local shop and maybe you'll be lucky enough to find one. Make sure to take a photo of it in the store and post it to social media with #TrapperTreasure and the store name.\\" Reception When the song \\"Lonesome Angel\\" was released in advance of the record, website Brooklyn Vegan summed it as \\"the kind of folk rock you might expect a band who covered an entire Neil Young album to write (and like other Blitzen Trapper songs, there's a strong Dylan influence here too).\\" Paste Magazine also reviewed the song, stating, \\"Anchored by a delightful harmonica hook, driving piano and country-tinged slide guitar, the track sounds like a long-forgotten gem from ‚Äò70s AM radio, striking the perfect balance between the Eagles and Bob Dylan while still managing to sound current. It‚Äôs the perfect soundtrack to a drive along the California coast with the windows down.\\" Closer to release date, the site expanded its review to the whole album, praising the record as \\"a throttle-up, open-highway sort of album, full of easygoing melodies and fist-pumping guitar hooks ... an album 15 years in the making, as the musicians are both in command of their talents individually and completely dialed in as a band.\\" Paste also compared the song \\"Nights Were Made For Love\\" to Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run; similarly, review site Soundblab found Springsteen influences, stating, \\"If the song had a sax solo, you‚Äôd swear it was a cover of some deep cut from Darkness on the Edge of Town or Tunnel of Love. Just the same, it‚Äôs a strong song on an album full of them.\\" Soundblab further appreciated the \\"sincerity\\" of the record, stating, \\"If their latest release is such an indicator, Blitzen Trapper may just have reached the pinnacle of that journey of self-identity.\\" AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, applauding the apparent shift in the band's intent: \\"No longer concerned with making even the slightest feint toward delicate indie rock sensibilities, Blitzen Trapper settle into the '70s on All Across This Land.\\" AllMusic further championed the production of the album, down to the sequencing, and stated, \\"Blitzen Trapper's period trappings -- which, outside of the occasional old-fashioned synth purloined from 1985, are meticulously accurate -- are the key to their charm, because they devote as much attention to their arrangements and productions as they do their songs.\\" Entertainment Weekly called the album \\"sunny ... bigger, synthier, warmer. Its guitars are brighter, more soaked in reverb.\\" But, of the album's introspective final track, \\"Across the River,\\" they state, \\"Earley makes it immediate and affecting, weaving a filigree portrait of longing for those long gone that only those who‚Äôve wondered what they have to do to see someone again will understand.\\" UK publication Uncut gave the album an 8 out of 10, enthusing, \\"Bandleader Eric Earley has a gift for shaping roots-rock tropes into sturdy songs with creamy hooks, and his band's strongest LPs, '08's Furr and '11's American Goldwing, hew faithfully to familiar forms. Blitzen Trapper's rock-solid eighth boasts a pair of instant grabbers\\" in the title track and the song \\"Lonesome Angel.\\" The album landed at #15 on Record Shop Radio Show's Top 30 Albums of 2015, and online radio station WFUV listed it among their \\"Best of 2015. Meanwhile, OPBMusic ranked the title track one of the best songs of the year, stating, \\"Blitzen Trapper‚Äôs 2015 release All Across This Land finds the band at their rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll best. The title track is rhythmic, catchy and fun, and feels like the kind of song you want to kick off a great road trip with ‚Ä¶ and then just keep listening to throughout the entire journey.\\" Track listing All songs written by Eric Earley References 2015 albums Vagrant Records albums Lojinx albums ","title":"All Across This Land"},{"id":"47115417","text":"Bongripper is an American doom metal band from Chicago, Illinois.
