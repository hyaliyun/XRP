History  ePACT Network Ltd. was founded by Christine Sommers and Kirsten Koppang-Telford in January, 2012. The idea for ePACT came from Ayumi, a survivor of the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, who was separated from her family and unable to contact them by text, landline or cellular phone after the disaster. A day after the earthquake hit, Ayumi was finally able to communicate via email with her parents, finding out her family had survived the natural disasters that hit her hometown of Fukushima ePACT was in closed beta from May 2012 to July 2013 with several elementary schools, daycares, sports teams and a secondary school in the Lower Mainland of Vancouver, BC. The system was subsequently made available for families and organizations to use anywhere in the world; however, it is currently only offered in English. As the Official Emergency Preparedness Sponsor, ePACT was used in the Medical Tent by support personnel managing response to medical crises for athletes participating in the 2013 Challenge Penticton triathlon on August 25. The system was used to alert medical staff to any medical considerations about athletes brought into the tent, such as allergies, medications they were taking, recent illnesses or injuries that could impact their health or response to medical care. The system was also used by support staff to contact the friends and relatives of athletes in the Medical Team to alert them to their location and let them know when they were released at point of recovery, or if they were taken by ambulance to the hospital for additional care. In 2014, ePACT was adopted by sports organizations across Canada, before moving into the Parks & Recreation market in Canada and the United States. partnering with the National Recreation and Parks Association.https://www.nrpa.org/parks- recreation-magazine/2017/september/new-emergency-network-provider-epact/  Features  Family users create an ePACT account to securely store emergency information, such as medical details and emergency contacts, for each member of their household. They then build a support network of family, friends and organizations (like schools or sports team) who support them. Families either send invites to friends or relatives they would like to connect with, or they receive invites from organizations that require their emergency information to support them day to day or in a crisis. Organizations use ePACT to invite their members to share emergency information with them so they can access critical details like medical needs (e.g. allergies, medications, recent illnesses) or key contacts (e.g. legal guardians of dependent children or adults, or support contacts like nannies, grandparents or neighbours if guardians are not accessible). Once connected, users can access the system anytime, anywhere via web or mobile, and communicate through the system.

The cricket field and facilities are located on the southern bank of the River Lee, and overlooked by University College Cork and St Vincent's Catholic Church. The ground is officially named after Richard Beamish, but it is generally called The Mardyke after the area where it is situated, or the Cricket Club as it is the home ground of Cork County Cricket Club. The Munster representative provincial side, the Munster Reds, also use The Mardyke as their home ground. History Cricket was first played at the Mardyke in 1850. Cork County Cricket Club was formed in 1874, and began playing their home grounds at the Mardyke. It was around the 1890s that a lot of the features of the ground were established, under the stewardship of Sir George Colthurst. Some of the improvements made to the ground around this time were also funded by the nearby Queen's College. Facilities were of a sufficient standard to attract teams from England, including W. G. Grace's London County, who played Ireland at the ground in 1903. The current long room was built for the 1902 International Exhibition. The onset of the First World War led to an end of touring teams playing at Cork, however cricket was played by army and naval forces based in and around Cork. With Irish independence in 1922, the military departed and cricket was more dependent on local civilian players. By the 1950s, the number of touring teams visiting the Mardyke had increased, and the ground hosted its inaugural first-class cricket match in 1947, when Ireland played Scotland. The Mardyke played host to two more first-class matches between the sides in 1961 and 1973.

This government organization is responsible for planning and developing the nation's power infrastructure and for operating much of its power generation facilities. The BPDB is responsible for the major portion of generation and distribution of electricity mainly in urban areas of the country. The Board is now under the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of Bangladesh. Engineer Belayet Hossain is the present Chairman of the Board. Mr. Saiful Islam Azad (BCS Admin Cadre) is now the Secretary of BPDB. Mr. Zahurul Haque (BCS Admin Cadre) is the Member Administration of the Board and Mr. Selim Abed (BCS Admin Cadre) is the Member Finance of the Board. The Board holds Directors from Bangladesh Administrative Service and from different cadres of government services. History After the creation of Pakistan, the then Pakistan government formed Electricity directorate to develop the power sector of the country. In 1957, the electricity directorate acquired all the private power stations and transmission lines in the country. In the year of 1958, East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA) was formed to effectively manage the power sector in the then East Pakistan. In 1960, the electricity directorate with all its assets was merged with EPWAPDA. Chattogram, Khulna and Shiddhirganj power stations was constructed at that time of which Shiddhirganj power station was the largest with 10MW installed capacity. In 1962, the Karnafuli Hydropower Station at Kaptai became operational. With two units of 40MW installed capacity each, it became the largest power plant in the country. The first long range transmission line was built connecting Kaptai with Shiddhirganj via 273 km long 132kV transmission line in 1962. After the independence of Bangladesh, WAPDA was separated by presidential order 59 (PO-59) and Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was formed with an installed generation capacity of 500MW. Subsequently, the Rural Electrification Board (REB) and the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) was formed dividing the BPDB. In 2000, the transmission lines were handed over to the newly formed Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. BPDB is now the parent company of Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd, Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh Limited, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh, Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited, North West Power Generation Company Limited, North West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited, and West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited. Operations BPDB is responsible for generation and distribution of a large part of country's total electricity demand. As of January 2020, BPDB had a total installed capacity of 5613 MW at its own power plants located in different parts of the country. The main fuel used for power generation in BPDB plants is indigenous natural gas. BPDP operations also include projects that utilize renewable power sources including offshore wind power generation. The maximum demand served during peak hours was 12,893 MW on 29 May 2019. The total distribution network length under BPDB is 30,051 km, including 33kV, 11kV and 0.4kV lines.

During his career he won medals in Algerian national championships, in African and Arab cycling championships as well as at the All Africa Games and the Pan-Arab Games. Career=2006‚Äì2009 As a youngster Lagab took part in the Tour de l'Espoir, a stage race within his own country for young and talented riders. In the first stage of this race with the finish line in Bordj Bou Arreridj he finished in second place. It was the start of the career of a cyclist who would become one of the best cyclists in his country. The prove of that already came in the following year when he became second in the individual time trial of the Algerian national road cycling championships. Then in 2008 he went on to win two races in Tunisia, the Grand Prix de la ville de Tunis and the Grand Prix de la Banque de l'Habitat. Later on he improved his national time trial second place by winning the event in 2008. In addition he also became second in the road race at the same championships. This all resulted in his first contract with a UCI Continental team namely Doha Team for the 2009 cycling season. With this team he took part in the Tour d'Alger in which he won the third stage, with start and departure in Alger as well as the general classification at the end. In another Algerian stage race, the Tour de Wilaya de Tipaza he finished in third place overall. Then in the Jelajah Malaysia he rode to a fifth place in the sixth stage, while he ended up in eighth position overall in the Tour of Singkarak. Team Doha then let him ride on the Presidential Tour of Iran where he took the seventh place overall. This year at the Algerian national road cycling championships he took a second place in the individual time trial. He then won the Grandglise criterium in Belgium before taking part at the 2009 Mediterranean Games in Pescara in which he placed 17th in the individual time trial and 19th in the road race. In the Tour des A√©roports in Tunisia he placed second in the first stage, before clinching the silver medal at the individual time trial of the 2009 Arab Cycling Championships. He finished 2009 with a third place in the Ouverture Saison de l'Alg√©rie at the end of October. 2010 For the 2010 cycling season the Doha Team did not return in the Continental circuit. As Lagab did not get a new contract with any other team he had to take a step back again. Still 2010 turned out to be a good year for him in which he booked many successes. Already in January he won a local Algerian race called Oued Al Alleug. In the Grand Prix International d'Alger he finished third in both the first and third stage and also reached the third spot in the general classification. Then in this year's Tour de Wilaya de Tipaza he won the first stage and finished third in the third stage. Lagab then traveled to Morocco to take part in the Challenges du Prince. He finished third in the Troph√©e Princier, second in the Troph√©e de l'Anniversaire and fourth in the Troph√©e de la Maison Royale. Back in Algeria it was time for the national road cycling championships again. This time Lagab took the national title on the road race arriving first at the finish in Chlef. He went on to take part in the 2010 Arab Cycling Championships in Tunis where he took the silver medal in the individual time trial event. A bronze medal was added in the same discipline at the African Cycling Championships that were held in Kigali. There he also finished fourth in the team time trial (with Abdelmalek Madani and Hichem Chabane) and sixth in the road race. 2011 A newly set up UCI Continental Team in Algeria called contracted Lagab for the 2011 season, giving his career a new lift. It turned out to be the best year of his career until then and he became the best scoring rider on the team. It took however until April to book his first notable result with a second place in the Challenges Phosphatiers I (also named Challenge Khouribga). Approximately a month later his first win of the season was clinched as he took the first place in the Troph√©e Princier of the Challenges du Prince. In the Troph√©e F√©d√©ral he won the first stage in Tiaret and became second in the second stage. This in combination with the results in the other stages gave him the win in the general classification as well. In Birtouta Lagab took the national title in the individual time trial championship, while he became second in the road race championship that was held in Ouled Fayet. A great achievement followed in the Tour d'Algerie where he won the second stage after finishing third in the first stage. He then received the leader's jersey after that stage and wore it for the remaining stages until he crossed the finish line of the fifth stage in Chrea to add another win to his palmares. This win was followed by another win in the Circuit d'Alger. 2011 continued with the 16th place in the Tour of Eritrea in preparation for the 2011 All- Africa Games that were held in Maputo. In the capital of Mozambique he finished in fifth position of the road race and he won the bronze medal at the individual time trial. His combined results of the year until then gave him an honorable third position in the 2011 UCI Africa Tour rankings. Lagab himself was not ready to finish 2011 yet and went on to win stage two and stage 5 of the Tour du Faso. Then in Eritrea he finished 4th in the team time trial of the 2011 African Cycling Championships alongside Abdelbasset Hannachi, Abderrahman Bourezza and Abdelmalek Madani. He also finished fourth in the individual time trial and 14th in the road race of the same Championships held in Asmara. After the Championships he won the Ouverture Saison de l'Alg√©rie before heading to his next Championships, the 2011 Pan Arab Games in Doha. In the Qatari capital he won three medals for Algeria. A bronze medal in the individual time trial and team trial (with Abdalla Ben Youcef, Abdelmalek Madani and Abderrahman Bourezza), as well as the silver medal in the road race. Algeria ended up being the first country to arrive at the finish with three riders (the others being Abdelmalek Madani and Youcef Reguigui), which brought Lagab and his team mates the gold medal in the team road race event. 2012 In 2012 Lagab was still contracted to the team. He won the fifth stage of the Tour d'Algerie and got to the seventh position in the general classification. In the Tour du Maroc he finished in 14th position overall, while during La Tropicale Amissa Bongo he rode to a ninth position in the general classifications. At the second stage of the Tour of Eritrea he finished in third position.

Eason joined the BBC in 1933 as the Children's Hour organiser in Belfast, a position she held for 18 years, becoming one of the \\"radio aunties\\". She was transferred to BBC television in London in 1952, and subsequently appointed Assistant Head of Children's Programmes under Freda Lingstrom. Hearing-impaired herself, Eason insisted that programmes for deaf children made use of signing. She also transformed a rather pedestrian series of five-minute children's programmes the BBC had acquired from France into what became a cult classic, The Magic Roundabout. Early life Ursula Eason was born on 19 August 1910 in Streatham, London, the fifth of six children born to auctioneer and surveyor Edward Eason and his wife Aisling, also known as Nancy, n√©e Bruton. She attended the Mount Nod School in Streatham, followed by University College London, from where she graduated with a degree in English. After completing a secretarial course she spent nine months working as a secretary to the assistant manager of The Times Book Club. Her long-standing interest in theatre and acting prompted Eason to apply for a position at the BBC in 1934, where she was interviewed by John Reith. A report of the interview describes Eason as \\"a practical, sensible, nice-looking 23-year-old.\\" BBC career Eason accepted the BBC's offer of a position as Children's Hour organiser in Belfast, where she remained for 18 years. She became a producer and head of the Children's Hour unit, taking part in programmes herself as Auntie Phoebe. During the Second World War, when many of the BBC's male staff were absent on military service, she was responsible for the entire output from BBC Northern Ireland. She was transferred to BBC television in London in 1952, and the following year was appointed a junior producer of children's programmes. In 1955 she became Assistant Head of Children's Programmes under Freda Lingstrom. Her two \\"outstanding contributions\\" in that role were to pioneer programmes for deaf children, and to transform a \\"charming\\" but rather pedestrian series of five-minute programmes acquired from France into what became a cult classic, The Magic Roundabout, as popular with adults as it was with young children. Hearing-impaired herself, Eason's first programme for deaf children, the monthly For Deaf Children, was developed in collaboration with Roy Cole of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) in 1953. Her significant breakthrough came in 1964 with Vision On, which instead of ghettoising the deaf was designed to appeal to all children, with its emphasis on the visual arts such as mime, painting and drawing. Supported by the RNID and the National Deaf Children's Society, Eason insisted that the programme made use of signing, even though it was then unpopular with many teachers of the deaf. Later life Eason never married, and retired from the BBC in 1970. She subsequently travelled all over the UK championing the RNID. Affected by the onset of Alzheimer's in her mid-70s, she was initially cared for by her sister Phoebe and her niece Ann, until she eventually had to give up her home in Kew Green and enter a nursing home. Eason died on 25 December 1993 and was cremated at Mortlake.

It is part of the genus Ancylomenes and was described in 1958 by Fenner A. Chace Jr. as Periclimenes pedersoni. Ancylomenes pedersoni is found in the Caribbean Sea, often associated with a sea anemone, at depths of . They are often found on the reefs off Bermuda. Description Pederson's shrimp is a small transparent shrimp with bluish and violet markings on the body and long white antennae and within its range is unlikely to be confused with other species. Ecology Pederson's shrimp lives in association with a sea anemone, either Bartholomea annulata or Condylactis gigantea, living among the tentacles with impunity. Before it can do this it needs to acclimatise itself to the anemone by progressively pressing its body and appendages against the tentacles for increasing periods of time. After this it is able to move between the tentacles without getting stung but if it is separated from its host for a few days, it will need to repeat the immunizing procedure. Up to 26 shrimps have been found associated with one sea anemone but usually there are just one or two. The shrimp offers cleaning services to passing fish and attracts their attention by lashing its antennae about. Fish visiting the cleaning station will remain stationary while their external parasites are removed and eaten by the shrimp, which even cleans inside the gill covers and the mouth. If a neon goby sets up a cleaning station nearby, the shrimp will clean the client fish at the same time as the goby does. Researchers have shown that fish recognise the sea anemone Bartholomea annulata as being a place at which the shrimps' services are likely to be available. The larger the sea anemone, the more likely fish are to visit it.

Due to these powers, he has had a considerable influence on the lives of several main characters including Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, John Locke, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes. Before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 Jacob's earliest chronological appearance is in the sixth-season episode \\"Across the Sea\\" where he is born to a Roman woman named Claudia, who was shipwrecked on the island sometime in the 1st century. Claudia also gave birth to Jacob's brother, otherwise known as The Man in Black. She was then murdered by the female protector of the Island, who then raised the brothers. Jacob was clothed in light cloth, a trademark of his that continued into adulthood. They were told that there was no life outside the island and that it was just them. They were also told about a mysterious light that eventually one of them had to protect. Eventually, the Man in Black discovered that their \\"mother\\" had lied to him and told Jacob that she was not their mother, but they belonged to a group of people who had arrived on the island with their biological mother. Jacob loved his mother too much and did not want to believe this. He ended up staying with his mother for the next 30 years, while the Man in Black lived with his people, though the brothers stayed in contact. The Man in Black and his people were about to discover how to tap into the light (which is revealed to be a source of electromagnetism) as a means of escaping the island. Their mother later initiated Jacob into becoming her replacement and proclaiming afterwards \\"Now we're the same\\". After learning about the Man in Black's plan to leave the Island from Jacob, the mother killed all of the Man in Black's people. In a fit of rage, he killed her. In revenge, Jacob threw his brother into the cavern which emitted the light, an act which he was told by his mother would lead to a fate \\"worse than death\\". The Man in Black emerged later as the Smoke Monster and was now trapped on the island. Wanting to escape, he wanted to kill Jacob, but was unable to do so. Due to the machinations of their mother, Jacob and the Man in Black are not able to kill each other. As a result, The Man in Black soon began a long-term plan to manipulate other people who came to the Island into killing Jacob. Aside from making sure the Man in Black stays on the Island, Jacob brings people to the Island to further a philosophical debate that humanity is innately good while the Man in Black echoed their mother's belief that humanity is inherently corrupt, a debate that has raged on for centuries with numerous casualties. Jacob's next chronological appearance was in the sixth-season episode \\"Ab Aeterno\\" set in 1857 when Richard Alpert became shipwrecked on the island. The Man in Black quickly manipulated him into attempting to kill Jacob. However, Jacob convinced Alpert to join him and granted him immortality, told him the true nature of the island, and made him his spokesperson. Whenever people crashed on the Island, Richard convinced them to come under Jacob's wing, thus creating the island natives dubbed \\"The Others\\". Richard was the leader at first, however it was eventually moved on to others like Charles Widmore, Eloise Hawking and eventually Ben Linus. Over time, Jacob had Richard recruit people from the mainland to become part of his group such as Juliet Burke and Tom Friendly. The leader of the Others would converse with Jacob and pass on his orders to the rest of the Others (who were not allowed to see him). However, when Ben became the leader, Jacob refused to show himself to Ben and Ben had to get the orders from Richard, sparking a deepening resentment Ben had toward Jacob regarding his own importance. For centuries, Jacob feared that The Man in Black would eventually kill him, so he chose candidates who would succeed him after his death. He visited Kate and Sawyer when they were children. Specifically, he protected Kate when she was caught stealing and touched her. He then made contact with a young Sawyer when he was writing a threatening note to Anthony Cooper. He later visited Sun-Hwa Kwon and Jin-Soo Kwon at their wedding and touched them to give his blessing. He also touched Locke when Locke apparently died after being pushed out a window of a very high building. He then touched Jack after Jack was taught about the counting to five strategy from his father. He visited Sayid Jarrah and this leads to saving him from dying with his wife. Hurley was touched by him right before boarding Ajira Flight 316. He managed to make all the candidates attend the Oceanic Flight 815 so they could crash on the island and succeed him. At some point before the crash of Ajira Flight 316, Jacob recruited his long-entrusted bodyguard Ilana Verdansky to help protect the remaining six candidates: Jack, Sawyer, Jin & Sun, Hurley, and Sayid. In turn, Verdansky got a group of others including an associate named Bram, to facilitate the return of the candidates to the island on the Ajira flight and to act as Jacob's bodyguards. After the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 and Ajira 316 The Man in Black finally found a loophole in Ben Linus. He convinced Ben that Jacob had neglected him and that he must kill Jacob. Jacob awaited his doom in a statue of Tawaret where he lived. As Jacob came in, he made a final attempt to convince Ben not to do it. However, Ben stabbed Jacob several times and then The Man in Black kicked him into the fire. Jacob then returned as a ghost and guided Hurley and the rest of the survivors as to how to defeat the Man in Black. At some point in the past, Jacob compiled a list of 364 candidates (virtually everyone that has visited the island since at least 1988) on a glass dial in a derelict lighthouse that only he is aware of until he instructs Hurley to take Jack there in a successful effort to show how important the latter is to his plan. Jacob constructed the list in a way that could correspond to certain numbers, just as he did in a cave that had more recent revisions. The Man in Black later showed Sawyer this cave in his elaborate plan to kill the candidates. It is later revealed that the candidates can't be killed by the Man in Black due to Jacob's rules so the former improvised his plot by manipulating the candidates into killing themselves which became partly successful with the deaths of Jin, Sun, and Sayid. Jacob's spirit finally vanished after he had Jack succeed him. Development The producers, particularly Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, have implied that the character was inspired by Aslan from the Chronicles of Narnia, showcasing his god-like powers and kind nature. DVD commentary Much like Aslan, Jacob serves as an almost eternal guardian of a fantastical realm‚Äîin this case the Island instead of Narnia. Lindelof also stated that he and co-creator J.J. Abrams had planned for the concept of light and dark to eventually be personified by Jacob and Man in Black, referencing the scene in Pilot, Part 2 where Locke explains the game of backgammon to Walt Lloyd. In addition, Christ can be seen as the prototypical model for the character of Jacob which was also the case for Aslan. In the episode, \\"What They Died For\\", Jacob appears before a burning bush and Jack accepts his responsibilities, mirroring Moses from the Book of Exodus. Another similarity can be attributed to Zoroastrianism where Jacob can be seen as Ahura Mazda and the Man in Black is that of Angra Mainyu (\\"the Angry Man\\"). Curiously enough, that phrase is used by Jacob's assistant, Dogen, who explains the nature of the Man in Black to Sayid.

It lived on Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Little is known about its habitat, but it possibly died out after the colonization of humans on these islands.  Description  Assigned right tibiotarsus The holotype specimen is a subfossil ulna. It was long and lies in size between the former sympatric C. leucognaphalus with and the hispaniolical C. palmarum with .  Habitat  Residues of the crow were found on Puerto Rico and on the island St. Croix, which belongs to the United States Virgin Islands. Little is known about its habitat. As it existed together with C. leucognaphalus on Puerto Rico, it possibly occupied a different ecological niche as the latter and was perhaps rather common in the island lowland.  Classification and taxonomy  The earliest residues of the crow were found in 1916 in the karst cave Cueva San Miguel near Morovis, Puerto Rico. It was a right ulna (AMNH 4925), which Alexander Wetmore described in 1920 as a holotype for his first description of the species C. pumilis. Wetmore did not comment on the etymology of the epithet pumilis, which means \\"dwarfish\\" in Latin. There are no insights on its relationships with other species of its genus within and beyond the Caribbean.  Extinction  C. pumilis possibly disappeared very early. In Puerto Rico it is only known from lagerst√§tten before the colonizations; on St. Croix it was found on a hearth from the Pre- Columbian era. The crow possibly died out before the settlement of Europeans in the Caribbean  References  ;Further reading * Pierce Brodkorb: Catalogue of Fossil Birds. In: Bulletin of the Florida State Museum.

Following the breakout of the Civil War in 1936 they supported the families of those killed in the National faction and took care of the basic assistance to the population of conquered cities.

University of Oviedo Publishing Service  History of Falange = Second Spanish Republic  The Franco regime banned all political parties and trade unions. The only permissible type organization was Falange, founded by Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933. Pilar Primo de Rivera headed the women's section, following its founding in 1933 as an auxiliary of the main organization. In this Second Republic period, both organizations had little popular support. It was not until the Civil War and the need for Francoist to have a vehicle for legitimacy that the party and its auxiliaries gained widespread support on the right. Falange saw in this Second Republic and Civil War Period a threat from a variety of different actors to what it perceived as the traditional way of Spanish life that it sought to preserve. These actors included women who sought social and political liberation, and they were viewed by Falange as a threat to the established order of Spanish life. Falange differed from other right wing nationalist groups at the time in that it had elements focused on social justice, and addressing the specific needs of the working classes. Among their goals was the nationalization of banks and public services, the creation of a workers syndicate, and the separation of church and state. This contrasted from other conservatives who sought to protect the financial assets of the elite. One of the early problems for Secci√≥n Femenina was Jos√© Antonio used Falange to criticize the role of women in the Second Republic and to attack things like the law that allowed divorce but at the same time failed to articulate how right leaning women could act in support of the state he sought. The only clear position Falange offered was that women needed to be educated so that they could best serve the needs of the Spanish empire.  Spanish Civil War  By the start of the war in July 1936, Secci√≥n Femenina had 2,500 members nationwide organized into 18 different province based branches. The death of Jose Antonio at the hands of Republican forces in November 1936 left Pilar feeling empowered to carry on his work, claiming the need to finish what he had started. She took a firm hand to lead the Women's Section of Falange during the Spanish Civil War. Pilar would continue to head the organization for another 43 years after its 1934 founding. Margaritas served behind the front lines as nurses, which meant Secci√≥n Femenina had to find another visible role. They did this by serving as relief workers. While Pilar had been in Madrid when the war broke out and could not flee until October 1936, she moved to Salamanca where Nationalist coup supporters had proven more successful. Meanwhile, Secci√≥n Femenina established a provisional headquarters in Vallodolid. During the war, women affiliated with Secci√≥n Femenina spread propaganda, sewed flags, visited Falangist prisoners in jail, supported families of prisoners and engaged in large scale fundraising activities in support of nationalist causes. Secci√≥n Femenina trained instructors and health practitioners, and in the process developed a number of strong female leaders. The organization also created territorial based sub-entities to implement their wider agenda of controlling women across Spain. Secci√≥n Femenina held their first national conference in January 1937, which allowed for the organization for the first time to highlight their accomplishments with support from the Nationalist established Spanish state. By 1939, Secci√≥n Femenina had a membership of over 580,000 women nationwide.  Political context  In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War started with a military coup attempt launched from the Spanish enclave of Melilla. In October of that same year, Franco took over as the Generalissimo and Chief of State in Nationalist zones. On 19 April 1937, Catholic and Falangist parties were merged, making Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista the official state party behind Nationalist lines. On 30 January 1938, the first National State Cabinet meeting was held, with the Spanish Civil War formally coming to an end on 1 April 1939 and an official government formalized on 8 August 1939. The Franco regime banned all political parties and trade unions. The only permissible type organization was Falange. During the Franco regime, membership in the Women's Section was a requirement for all women. An election was held in 1966, where people were given the option to affirm or deny Franco's leadership. With more voters than electors, Franco was affirmed as Head of State. Prince Juan Carlos was appointed as Franco's official successor in 1970, with Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco being the unofficial successor. Carrero Blanco was assassinated in 1973 by ETA. Franco died in November 1975.  Organization  Secci√≥n Femenina Organizational Structure.The Women's Section closely mirrored the strict hierarchical structure of Falange, which allowed it to be easily subverted into Franco's regime by controlling the people at the top of its institutional ladder. The structure followed the male structure, and was established during the Civil War. The national organization appointed provincial leaders, who would in return report back on the needs of their area. These leaders in turn would report provisional leaders to deal with specific areas and to appoint local leaders on a village or district level. They would in turn appoint leaders to deal with specific areas on the village or district level. With victory appearing imminent, in the waning days of the Spanish Civil War, Secci√≥n Femenina started training provincial leaders known as mandos, mandos pol√≠ticos and mandos de servicio in at a school in M√°laga. The end of the war saw the reality that leaders trained in political ideology of the new regime were required. While mandos were a function of leadership in Second Republic and Civil War Secci√≥n Femenina, mandos pol√≠ticos did not feature until the Franco regime. Mandos pol√≠ticos and mandos de servicio would largely work on the local level to ensure ideological compliance. Secci√≥n Feminina always explicitly supported patriarchy in Spain through its continual deferral to Franco's fascist ideology, the Roman Catholic Church and male political apparatus. Despite this, the organizations impact in defining the roles of girls and women also helped inform the role of boys and men in Spain.  Post- war activity  Secci√≥n Feminina played an important role in Francoist Spain in subjugating women by creating a narrative for women to internalize that involved women being inferior to men. Gender norms were reinforced the organization. The Women's Section found itself facing challenges in the early part of Francoist Spain as Falange had no specified ideology for the role of women. The main consideration was that they not challenge the role of men, nor the concept that husbands were the head of the household or that they competed economically with men. Consequently, the Women's Section of Falange focused on supporting and refining women's domestic contributions. They taught women that their primary expertise was in housekeeping, childcare, traditional crafts, and small-scale agricultural production. The focus on some of these small scale economic activities played an important role in stabilizing Spain in the post War period. Among women in leadership in the organization, they would insult and attack each other by accusing other women of being feminists. Panoramic view of the Castle of La Mota. The castillo de la Mota in Medina del Campo was the center of the Escuela Superior de Formaci√≥n de la Secci√≥n Femenina in the Francoist period. Inside, women and teenaged girls were trained to become Falangist leaders in defense of the Spanish family. Lessons were given on hygiene, embroidery, cooking, singing of patriotic hymns, and saying of prayers. In May 1939, Pilar Primo de Rivera organized a festival at La Mota castle in Medina del Campo which was attended by 10,000 girls and young women. With Franco in attendance, Pilar asked that the castle be used as the seat of Secci√≥n Femenina and reforms were then started later that year to repurpose it for the organization's needs. Secci√≥n Femenina also was involved in spiritual training and in creating a spiritual identity for its members. Unlike conservatives outside Falange, Secci√≥n Femenina was unique in teaching women that they had individual potential and were not passive observers in their own lives. Their ideology, steeped in Catholicism, predated similar reforms in the Church implemented as a result of the Second Vatican Council. Women needed to complete Secci√≥n Feminina's Servicio Social program in order to get a passport, drivers license, join an association or obtain educational titles. It could be completed by engaging in service activities at children's canteens, workshops, hospitals, and by engaging in physical activity like gymnastics or approved women's sports. Working-class women were supported by being invited to participate in syndicalist committees, and by the Women's Section constantly highlighting that for many poor women, it was a necessary evil that women should leave their homes to work and that such work was still secondary to marriage and motherhood. A 1944 edition of Semanario de la SF said, \\"The life of every woman, despite what she may pretend, is nothing but a continuous desire to find somebody to whom she can succumb. Voluntary dependency, the offering of every minute, every desire and illusion is the most beautiful thing, because it implies the cleaning away of all the bad germs -- vanity, selfishness, frivolity -- by love.\\" Starting in May 1946, Secci√≥n Feminina, in conjunction with their magazine Ventanal, began an hour long Monday night weekly radio program that focused on women's writers. Their first interview was with Rosa Mar√≠a Cajal. They would also interview Blanca Espinar, Dolores P√©rez Camarero, Mar√≠a Jos√© Pomar, Carmen Mart√≠n de la Escalara and Mar√≠a Antonia Morales. Despite their intention of promoting women's writers, most of their interviews and commentary were often in support of state goals, namely in reinforcing women as being passive with their primary role being wives and mothers, not writers. The 1950s saw a diminishment of the importance of the Women's Section as their role in shoring up the economy and producing propaganda for national unity were less needed. In response, it switched to become more clearly a social welfare arm of the state. The organization lost much of its political influence and position within the Francoist structure. Its survival was largely because of their involvement in education and no other organization offered women of this period the same level of opportunities. Secci√≥n Feminina played a critical role in advancing changes to the 1955 Ley de Regimen Local about the role of married women in 1968. Consequently, married women were allowed to vote and run in local elections. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Women's Section aided in raising expectations of what was possible for women to accomplish by taking personal responsibility for their actions. Secci√≥n Feminana was formally dissolved in 1977, two years after the death of Franco. Secci√≥n Femenina had been trying to organize the Congreso Internacional de la Mujer since 1967. Their initial efforts were delayed several years, including for budget reasons in 1969. The congress was finally held in 1970 from 7‚Äì14 June in Madrid. 900 people from 44 countries attended. This conference would play an important role in the establishing of the United Nations Year of the Woman in 1975. People and groups Federation Internationale des Femmes des Carri√®res Juridiques, founder Mar√≠a Telo, Universidad de Madrid sociologist and professor Mar√≠a √Ångeles Dur√°n, Mar√≠a Moliner and Mar√≠a del Campo Alange, the Associations of Housewives and Italian historian Giulia Gadaleta. Most came as individuals, not as official representatives of different organizations. This was because many participants were hesitant to have their organizations being seen as supporting an organization, Secci√≥n Femenina, that they considered retrograde when it came to women's rights. Despite many attendees thinking abortion, divorce and contraceptive were important to understanding the situation of Spanish women, these topics were largely out of bounds because of Secci√≥n Femenina's positions on them. Secci√≥n Femenina tried to drive working groups to discuss the needs of children and how to incorporate women into public life. The intention to organize the International Year of Women was announced by the United Nations in 1972. Secci√≥n Feminina then launched a political campaign to be the point organization for United Nation plans around women. Absent any other organization capable of doing this, the government agreed and published their decision in Decreto 950/1974. The regime followed this with statements about plans to reform or eliminate laws that incapacitated women. In dealing with the evolving problems of women, President of Government Arias Navarro said in 1974 ahead of the International Year of the Woman, that Spain needed a \\"genuine and profitable Spanish feminism\\", a feminism that had Spanish origins and was free of foreign influence. It should not come from \\"communities of traditions well differentiated to ours or that are in a very different state of development.\\" Navarro was likely indicating support for Secci√≥n Femenina, and not for other qualified Spanish feminists of the period like Mercedes Formica and Maria Angeles Dur√°n.  Education  One of the goals of the Women's Section was to use fascist ideology about the role of women and Falange's teachings in a woman's individual agency to attract leftist women who were seeking to enjoy some semblance of the freedoms they had enjoyed during the 1920s and 1930s. They did this in part through educational efforts and providing a political outlet. The Women's Section continued to build schools in the post-war period. Pilar, serving as a link between her brother and Falangist originalism, ensured the organization's survival even as it lost some of its early impetus and grew exceptionally in size. Opportunities to work, study or travel required taking classes on cooking, sewing, childcare and the role of women before they were granted. If women did not take or pass these classes, they were denied these opportunities. The Women's Section promoted the idea that the only people who could educate Spain's youngsters. The impact of this was that Secci√≥n Femenina encouraged women into secondary and university education so they could impart knowledge to the next generation. This could become problematic at times as there was a fine line in Falangist thinking between seeking education for practical reasons and seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge in the vein of Second Republic feminists. Pilar Primo de Rivera attended the 1943 National Council of Spanish Education Service as the leader of the Women's Section. While an influential leader at the first edition of the National Council, she took pains to make sure her rhetoric was that which indicated a subordinate role because she was a woman. She said of women's education at the conference, \\"In regard to the role of women in the Party, we should unilaterally consider the condition of woman, and as a secondary thing her profession, work, etcetera, because even if she is a good worker, a good student, or a good teacher, principally, she is a woman, with a determined goal to accomplish, that, sometimes, accidentally, brings her to the University and to the workplace.\\" She continued, arguing that women had never offered anything as they lacked intelligence and creativity, that they never discovered anything, and that they needed guidance from men to interpret information.

He was trained at the Amsterdam Mennonite seminary and first served in Borne from 1859, where he met and later married Anna Geertruida Ballot in 1861. He then served in Rotterdam from 1862, where he served on the board of the Rotterdam-based Nederlandsch Zendelings Genootschap (Dutch Mission Society) from 1864.Craandijk, Jacobus (1825-1899) on the Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online In 1869 he wrote the book Het Nederlandsch zendelinggenootschap in zijn willen en werken, in which he reported on the goals and more and less successful results of that society since its inception.Het Nederlandsch zendelinggenootschap in zijn willen en werken, J. Craandijk, M. Wyt & Zonen, Rotterdam, 1869 (223 pages) It upset him to see that each religion set up its own missionary work, which in his opinion, was a waste of resources. In general, it was his aim to persuade people of all faiths to invest in one Missionary society as a way to join forces for good in the third world.

In the medieval period a family took their name from the castle. \\"Pietrapelosa\\" comes from the Italian words meaning \\"hairy stone\\" after the moss that has always grown on the walls of the castle. It is one of the best-preserved of the Istrian castles. History Pietrapelosa is a few kilometers west of Buzet in a strategic location at the head of the Braƒçana valley. It is first mentioned in a document of 965 A.D. in a deed recording its gift by Rodaold, patriarch of Aquileia to the bishopric of Poreƒç. In the 13th century it was given to a family of German knights who assumed the name of the castle, \\"de Pietrapelosa\\". The castle was the seat of the Aquileian lieutenant governor of Istria. The Venetian commander Taddeo d'Este conquered the castle and abolished the secular rule of the patriarchs of Aquileia in 1421, with Istria being divided between the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg County of Pazin. The Venetian Council of Ten granted the castle to the nobleman Nicol√≤ Gravisi in 1440, giving him the title if Marquis of Pietrapelosa. He renovated the castle for use as a summer residence. In 1635 a fire destroyed the interior of the castle, but it was restored and inhabited until the 18th century. The Gravis family owned the castle until the final abolition of the feudal system in 1869. They were the only aristocratic family in Koper to own such an estate. Building The castle was surrounded by three-story walls, which are still intact. It included a main four-story polygonal watchtower, sometimes also used as a residence. There was also a house and a palace chapel of St. Mary Magdalene dating from the 12th century. The chapel is built in the classic Istrian style with one nave and a bell tower. A residential area was built on a crag beside the castle with no walls. The castle avoided destruction throughout the many wars that ravaged Istria. However, it fell into ruin after being abandoned, and has only recently been restored. From the castle there is a dramatic view of Northern Istria.

The series debuted in 1997. Since then, five games have been published, one of which has been translated into English. There are also translations into other languages. In Germany, four games were published by the company Terzio Verlag. Gary Gadget is called Willy Werkel in German. All five games have been translated into Dutch and published by the company Transposia. Gary Gadget is called Miel Monteur in Dutch. The computer games are based on the Swedish children's book series of the same name, by George Johansson and Jens Ahlbom.  Platforms  All five parts are available for Windows, four of them also for Apple Mac, except for the computer game Bygg flygplan med Mulle Meck.  Game Mechanics  In all of the five published games about Gary Gadget there are some elements that always persist. Depending on the game you are playing the objective of the game is to build a certain thing, ranging from cars and ships to spacecraft. You always start from Gary's base of operations, which differ from game to game, where the actual building takes place. You build through a drag and drop-system by dragging fitting parts from Gary's storage house onto a template of the thing that you are building. The games don't have a final objective. Instead, you gather parts, keep building new things and explore the world.  Content  The computer games are about a man named Gary Gadget, a general handyman who throughout the five games builds cars, ships, planes, houses and space ships.  Bygg bilar med Mulle Meck (Building Cars with Gary Gadget)  In the first video game, Bygg bilar med Mulle Meck, published in 1997, Mulle builds cars from various parts and junk that he finds and drives through the town. You can find new parts at random on the ground while driving through the in-game map. You can also receive parts from Gary's friend Figge Ferrum, the scrap dealer, who gives Gary car parts at random instances in the game. Figge also often loses his dog which you can bring back to him. Gary gets orders from different people during the video game, which the player should fulfill. The first game is the only one which has been published in English so far.  Bygg b√•tar med Mulle Meck  In the second game Bygg b√•tar med Mulle Meck, published in 1998, Gary builds ships. In the beginning, the player learns that Gary has driven down a road in a car and wanted to know how to go on. So Gary made a rowing boat and paddled along. Gary reaches a shipyard. There, the owner asks him to take care of the yard, while she goes sailing around the world. In this game, Gary receives again tasks which the player must fulfill. The parts for building his ships are bought from Doris Digital.  Bygg flygplan med Mulle Meck  In the third game Bygg flygplan med Mulle Meck, published in 2000, the player gets to know that Gary has found the abandoned hangar of two airplanes constructors and wants to try that trade. Again he receives his parts from Doris Digital. Gary flies to visit his friends and like in the previous episodes he gets orders which the player must complete.  Bygg hus med Mulle Meck  In the fourth part Bygg hus med Mulle Meck, published in 2002, Gary Gadget finds his house in debris after a storm caused a tree to fall on it. He promptly starts to builds houses. In this instance you can travel around the game map via both car and boat.  Uppt√§ck rymden med Mulle Meck  The fifth episode Uppt√§ck rymden med Mulle Meck, which was published in 2004, starts with Gary contemplating that while he had built houses in Bygg hus med Mulle Meck he had also been sitting on the porch of his house, watching the sky. Thereupon he became eager to fly into space. In this game, the player not only flies into outer space but also completes tasks down on Earth. Gary visits his friends by car. Of course he also builds his own spacecraft.  Reception  The German c‚Äôt magazine rated the game Bygg bilar med Mulle Meck thus: \\"Autos bauen mit Willi Werkel ist nett gemacht, kann aber eigene Bastelerfahrungen nicht ersetzen. [Bygg bilar med Mulle Meck is made nicely but cannot make up for one's own construction experience.]\\" Netzwelt.de tested Bygg flygplan med Mulle Meck on 7 February 2010, concluding that it was well suitable for children at primary school age. c‚Äôt tested the episodes Bygg flygplan med Mulle Meck in issue 17/2001, Bygg hus med Mulle Meck in 23/2003 and Uppt√§ck rymden med Mulle Meck in 24/2005.

Michael was appointed patriarch by the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, culminating what had been a highly distinguished intellectual and administrative career.Magdalino, p. 301. Before becoming Patriarch, Michael III had held a progression of important church administrative offices, including referendarios, epi tou sakelliou, and protekdikos, the last of which was in charge of the tribunal which adjudicated claims for asylum within the Great Church. The most important of his appointments before receiving the Patriarchal throne was the office of h√Ωpatos t≈çn philos√≥ph≈çn (, \\"chief of the philosophers\\"), a title given to the head of the imperial University of Constantinople in the 11th‚Äì14th centuries.. In this role he condemned the neoplatonist philosophers, and encouraged study of Aristotle's work on the natural sciences as an antidote.Hussey, p. 155. As Patriarch, Michael III continued to deal with the theological issue of the relation between the Son and the Father in the Holy Trinity. The issue was created due to the explanation that one Demetrius of Lampi (in Phrygia) gave to the phrase of the Gospel of John , which means my Father is bigger than me (John, XIV.29). Michael acted as the Emperor's chief spokesman on this issue. Michael also ordered a review of Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical and imperial laws and decrees by Theodore Balsamon known as the \\"Scholia\\" (Greek: Œ£œáœåŒªŒπŒ±) (c. 1170). Michael's patriarchy was marked by the Emperor Manuel's attempts to forge a union with the Catholic Church. Continuing a longstanding papal policy, Alexander III demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere, and wished themselves to reach superiority over the Byzantine Emperor; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other.A. A. Vasiliev, History of the Byzantine Empire (1952) chapter 7 in passim Manuel, on the other side, wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West.J.W. Birkenmeier, The Development of the Komnenian Army, 114 Such conditions would not be accepted by either side. Even if a pro-western Emperor such as Manuel agreed to it, the Greek citizens of the Empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort, as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope. In existing correspondence Michael presents a deeply courteous but unbending position on the authority of his Church. The correspondence also show a good working relationship with the Emperor. Some of Michael III's correspondence with Manuel I survive,P. Magdalino, The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos, p. 21. as does his inaugural address as h√Ωpatos.R. Browning, \\"A New Source on Byzantine- Hungarian Relations\\", Balkan Studies, 2 (1961), pp. 173‚Äì214 Other documents including correspondence with Pope Alexander III have been attributed to him, though they are more likely later apocryphal creations of the 13th century.Hussey, p. 173. Michael III can also take credit for acting as patron to the young Michael Choniates, who composed an encomium in his honour, still extant.P. Magdalino, p. 301.

They are notably absent from the Mississippi Delta, which divides their range into two separate groupings. Description Adults are long and slender, ranging from in total length. The longest on record was . They are among North America's largest native snakes. The head and neck are usually black, fading to tan posteriorly. Some specimens may lack the dark head and neck pigmentation. Their smooth scales and coloration give the appearance of a braided whip, hence the common name. Habitat The subspecies can be found in a wide variety of habitats, but is most abundant in the southeastern coastal plain. Its preferred habitat includes sandy pine woodlands, pine-palmetto flatwoods, cedar glades, and along creeks, marshes and swamplands. Behavior & diet The Eastern coachwhip is an active, fast- moving snake. It is diurnal and hunts it prey by smell and sight. It frequently hunts with its head raised above the ground and vegetation, and unlike most snakes, visually locks onto its prey's position before capture. Following capture, the snake swallows its prey alive. It has strong jaws with rows of small, inward slanting teeth. It has sometimes been observed to beat its prey against the ground in an apparent effort to stun it prior to swallowing. Prey items include birds, large insects, lizards, other snakes, and small mammals. Reproduction Eastern coachwhips mate in the spring, with the female laying a clutch of 10-16 eggs in June or July. The eggs are laid in rotting vegetation or logs. The hatchlings emerge after 6 to 11 weeks, and are initially in length. Myth A common myth is that the Eastern coachwhip will intentionally attack people and whip them with its tail. This is false. In truth, when disturbed this snake will usually quickly flee. It will sometimes vibrate the tip of its tail among the ground litter, making a sound suggestive of a rattlesnake. If trapped, it will aggressively defend itself, striking repeatedly and biting.

The last Soyuz-U carrier rocket launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome was used to perform the launch, which took place at 18:05 UTC on 17 May 2012. The launch successfully placed the satellite into low earth orbit. It subsequently received its Kosmos designation, and the international designator 2012-024A. The United States Space Command assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 38335. Ground track of Kosmos 2480 Kobalt-M Kobalt-M satellites are a type of Yantar satellite, Yantar-4K2M. They have the GRAU index 11F695M. They are optical reconnaissance satellites which use film. The satellite sends two film capsules to earth and returns to earth itself at the end of its mission. This has the disadvantage that the satellite's life is dependent on how much film it can carry, and information from the satellite is not obtained until the film canister has returned to earth and been developed.

He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Giessen from 1965 to 1993. In 1984 he received the Sigmund Freud Prize for Scientific Prose. Early life and education Odo Marquard was born in Stolp, Farther Pomerania. He studied philosophy, German literature and theology, obtaining his doctorate at the University of M√ºnster and his habilitation at the University of Freiburg. In M√ºnster he studied under Joachim Ritter, whose Ritter School he sometimes is considered a member of. An even greater influence was Max M√ºller, whom Marquard studied under in Freiburg, and his use of the philosophy of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger to create a phenomenological update of neo- scholasticism. Career From 1965 to 1993, Marquard held a chair for philosophy at the University of Giessen, serving as dean of the philosophical faculty. In 1982‚Äì1983 he was a fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. From 1985 to 1987 he was the president of the General Society for Philosophy in Germany. In 1984 he was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize for Scientific Prose by the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung. He was awarded the Erwin-Stein-Preis (1992), the Ernst-Robert-Curtius-Preis for essay writers (1996), the Hessian Cultural Prize for science (1997), the Hessian Order of Merit (1990) and two Orders of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany: the Cross of Merit 1. Class (1995) and the Great Cross of Merit (2008). In 1994, the year after he became professor emeritus, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Jena. Thought A proponent of philosophical hermeneutics and skepticism, Marquards work focuses on aspects of human fallibility, contingency and finitude. He rejected idealist, rationalist and universalist conceptions and defended philosophical particularism and pluralism. His essay \\"In Praise of Polytheism\\" provoked discussion and controversy in Germany. In it, he promotes a \\"disenchanted return of polytheism\\" as a political theology. Criticized by J√ºrgen Habermas as a representative of German neoconservatism, his philosophy has been described as a form of liberal conservatism with various parallels to postmodern thought and the work of Richard Rorty.

Founded in 1948 as Fox Chapel Country Day School (FCCDS), the school began with 18 children in a nursery school class, housed on the third floor of Fox Chapel Community Church (now Christ Church Fox Chapel). In the 1950s, the search began for a permanent location for the school, and a grade level was added each year to grow the school through fifth grade. In 1960, Richard K. Whiteman was appointed head of school, a tenure that would last for 40 years. In 1970, FCCDS became accredited by the Pennsylvania Association of Private Academic Schools (PAPAS). While continuing to share space with the church, the school reconfigured the facilities to suit its needs. In 1999, a major addition to join two buildings and create a new space for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten classrooms was completed. The playground was replaced in 2011.

The rocket engine uses Aerozine 50 as fuel, and as oxidizer. It was developed in early 1970s by TRW as a derivative of the lunar module descent engine (LMDE). This engine used a pintle injector first invented by Gerard W. Elverum Jr. and developed by TRW in late 1950s and received US Patent in 1972. This injector technology and design is also used on SpaceX Merlin engines. The thrust chamber was initially developed for the Apollo lunar module and was subsequently adopted for the Delta expendable launch vehicle 2nd stage. The engine made 10 flights during the Apollo program and 77 during its Delta career between 1974 and 1988. The TRW TR-201 was re-configured as a fixed- thrust version of the LMDE for Delta's stage 2. Multi-start operation is adjustable up to 55.6 kN and propellant throughput up to 7,711 kg; and the engine can be adapted to optional expansion ratio nozzles. Development of the innovative thrust chamber and pintle design is credited to TRW Aerospace Engineer Gerard W. Elverum Jr. The combustion chamber consists of an ablative- lined titanium alloy case to the 16:1 area ratio. Fabrication of the 6Al4V alloy titanium case was accomplished by machining the chamber portion and the exit cone portion from forgings and welding them into one unit at the throat centerline. The ablative liner is fabricated in two segments and installed from either end. The shape of the nozzle extension is such that the ablative liner is retained in the exit cone during transportation, launch and boost. During engine firing, thrust loads force the exit cone liner against the case. The titanium head end assembly which contains the Pintle Injector and propellant valve subcomponents is attached with 36 A-286 steel ¬º inch bolts. In order to keep the maximum operating temperatures of the titanium case in the vicinity of 800¬∞F, the ablative liner was designed as a composite material providing the maximum heat sink and minimum weight. The selected configuration consisted of a high density, erosion-resistant silica cloth/phenolic material surrounded by a lightweight needle-felted silica mat/phenolic insulation. The installed pintle injector, unique to TRW-designed liquid-propulsion systems, provides improved reliability and less costly method of fuel‚Äìoxidizer impingement in the thrust chamber than conventional coaxial distributed- element injectors typically used on liquid bipropellant rocket engines.

Proborhyaenid remains have been found in western Bolivia, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and the provinces of Mendoza, Salta, and Chubut, in Argentina. Most proborhyaenids had a robust, hyena-like skull, although one species, Callistoe vincei, had an elongate, narrow skull more reminiscent of a thylacine.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978. in life, the enamel may have been very thin or restricted to the tooth tips. In the genus Arminiheringia the lower canines are protruding. Proborhyaenids can be distinguished from other sparassodonts by their grooved upper and lower canines, which grew continuously throughout the animals' lives like rodent incisors. Bond and Pascual (1983) argued that proborhyaenid canines stopped growing in late adulthood based on a specimen from Mendoza Province, Argentina, but the proborhyaenid identity of this specimen is disputed. The presence of open-rooted upper canines in thylacosmilids has led to the suggestion that proborhyaenids are closely related to, or even ancestral to, this group, but this is still controversial.

Acrylic on linen, 54 x 135 inches. Courtesy DC Moore Gallery, New York. Barbara Takenaga (born 1949 in North Platte, Nebraska) is an abstract painter who is known for her swirling, dot-based paintings that recall cosmic and cellular imagery. She is currently represented by DC Moore Gallery in New York and by Gregory Lind Gallery in San Francisco. Biography Takenaga attended the University of Colorado Boulder, earning a BFA in 1972 and a MFA in 1978. She has been the Mary A. & William Wirt Warren Professor of Art at Williams College since 1985. Takenaga also taught briefly at the University of Denver from 1982 to 1984. She currently lives and works both in Williamstown, MA and in New York, where her studio is located. Work Although a printmaker early in her career, Takenaga is primarily known for her oil and acrylic paintings. She has been exhibiting her work since 1993. Her paintings rely on the repetition of dots in saturated colors to form various patterns and create sweeping or spiraling movements. The center or horizon of these paintings often is lighter, creating a luminous effect. In the last several years, Takenaga's penchant for a neon- bright, even garish palette has changed following the death of her mother in 2002. The muted \\"twilight palette\\" of grays and blues reflects Takenaga's mourning. The artist has remarked that \\"the colors got icier and colder. I think these grey paintings have some sense of fading-- shiny, hazy, shifting.\\" Due to her use of tessellated forms, Takenaga's work is noted for its challenging optical quality. A sense of infinity and boundlessness are associated with the dizzying patterns created in her paintings. Her series Night Paintings, for instance, are based on \\"recurring childhood dreams about the origins of the universe.\\" Her upbringing in rural Nebraska is connected to this sense of \\"boundlessness.\\" Art critic Nancy Princenthal suggests that \\"these paintings evoke the flat farmland of Takenaga's childhood home, in Nebraska [...] There is that sense of limitless, un marked expanses in Takenaga's recent paintings, of matter-of-fact infinitude.\\" The laborious, repetitive process involved to make her paintings suggests the passing of time in her work. Susan Cross writes: \\"Takenaga has likened her approach to art- making to both soap opera narratives in which essentially nothing happens over long stretches of time and to the myth of Odysseus's wife Penelope, who unraveled her weaving each night for three years to put off her unwanted suitors. In a similar fashion, Takenaga's process both marks time and slows it down, allowing it to move forwards and backwards much like the sense of space in her paintings, which takes us spinning deep into the cosmos or right back to the work's surface, evoking both beginnings and endings.\\" Takenaga has been influenced by artists such as Charles Burchfield and Roger Brown (artist), among others. Critical reception Critics often refer to Takenaga's style as \\"psychedelic.\\" In reference to this Carol Diehl writes, \\"Takenaga‚Äôs work has been described as psychedelic, but that implies a loss of control, where these paintings are the result of acute attention. While they no doubt owe much to the precedents of Op art and Pattern and Decoration, Takenaga‚Äôs repetitive forms, like Ross Bleckner‚Äôs, inspire more mystical interpretation. If her idiosyncratic images can be said to resemble anything, it is van Gogh‚Äôs The Starry Night, with its swirls of celestial light updated to the computer age.\\" A reviewer for The New York Sun commented on the \\"prejudice\\" the viewer might have to overcome viewing Takenaga's paintings: \\"Once the eye adjusts to a sense of gaudy overload, and overcomes the prejudice of feeling you might have seen such imagery on the cover of a molecular chemistry textbook, it becomes clear that she is an image crafter of formidable power.\\" This opinion‚Äîovercoming the sense of \\"gaudy overload\\"‚Äîis also echoed by a review on artcritical.com. The reviewer writes that \\"While these transcendental apparitions might be misread as kitsch or imitations of 1960s psychedelia, the artist's skillful handling of her subject matter proves otherwise.\\" Carol Diehl also praised Takenaga's change to a more horizontal, landscape format. In 2012, she remarked that \\"The relatively recent addition of the horizon line is a major development for Takenaga [...] Few could have predicted that this normally balanced and stabilizing element would provide the disruption her work needed and a place from which it could expand. Previously her images were beautiful but congested, overshadowed by her painstaking and obsessive methodology. One would simply marvel that anyone could create such fine and intricate work freehand, especially with a material as mundane as acrylic paint. Further, the emphasis was on a kernel-like center that brought the eye from the outside in, whereas now the horizon line allows the nucleus to burst forth in burgeoning whorls that imply galaxies outside the picture plane.\\" In a 2007 article \\"The New Abstraction\\" in ARTnews, Barbara A. MacAdam cites Takenaga as well as Chris Martin (artist), Larry Poons, and others, as part of a general return to abstract painting. Her compositions that use dots to form various waves and patterns have drawn favorable comparisons to the work of Yayoi Kusama. In a review of Takenaga's paintings in The New York Sun, art critic Franklin Einsprunch archly writes: \\"Think Yayoi Kusama, but with less obsessive-compulsive disorder and more feeling for paint.\\" Awards and honors * 2009 Wauson Fellowship, For-Site Foundation, San Francisco, CA * 2008 Eric Isenburger Annual Award, National Academy Museum, New York, NY * 2005 Hassam, Speicher, Betts, and Symons Purchase Awards, American Academy of Arts & Letters, NY * 2004 Artist's Resource Trust Grant, Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation * 1998 Massachusetts Artist Fellowship in Painting, Massachusetts Cultural Council and the New England Foundation for the Arts * 1993 Artist's Residency Grant, Art In General, NY State Council on the Arts; Fellowship in painting, New England Foundation for the Arts * 1992 Studio Grant, Space Program in New York City, Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation; Asian Women United Grant for collaborative video with Christine Choy; Alice Baber Art Fund Grant, New York, NY Solo exhibitions 2013 * Barbara Takenaga, DC Moore Gallery, New York, NY 2012 * Barbara Takenaga, Gregory Lind Gallery, San Francisco, CA 2011 * Barbara Takenaga: New Paintings, DC Moore Gallery, New York, NY 2010 * Barbara Takenaga, Gregory Lind Gallery, San Francisco, CA 2009 * Barbara Takenaga: last blue wheel, DC Moore Gallery, New York, NY * Fade Away and Radiate, Rule Gallery, Denver, CO 2008 * Gregory Lind Gallery, San Francisco, CA (also 2006, 2003) 2007 * Brattleboro Art Museum, Brattleboro, VT * McKenzie Fine Art, New York, NY * Museum of Nebraska Art, Kearney, NE * Gallery Camino Real, Boca Raton, FL 2006 * Museum of Outdoor Art, Englewood, CO 2005 * CU Art Museum, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 2004 * McKinney Avenue Contemporary, Dallas, TX 2001 * James Graham & Sons, New York, NY 1997 * Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, PA 1993 * Cambridge Multicultural Center, Cambridge, MA * College of Wooster Art Museum, Wooster, OH * Art In General, New York, NY 1992 * Mary H.

Finally, a re-imaging lens maps the dispersed image of the field stop onto a large-format detector array. Shown here is an example in which the device is imaging the university of Arizona's logo, uses a kinoform grating to disperse the transmitted light, and measures a dispersion pattern on the detector array. After measurement, an algorithm is used to convert the multiplexed (overlapped) two-dimensional data into the three-dimensional datacube (spectrally resolved image). Conceptually, one can consider each of the dispersed images on the detector as a 2D projection of the 3D datacube, in a manner analogous to the way in which X-ray projections measured by medical computed tomography instruments are used to estimate the 3D volume distribution within a patient's body.Michael Descour and Eustace Dereniak, \\"Computed-tomography imaging spectrometer: experimental calibration and reconstruction results\\", Applied Optics 34: 4817-4826 (1995).

Biography Born in Zanesville, Ohio, Jackson was sworn in as judge in the State of Ohio in 1942. He served Cleveland and Cuyahoga County for 44 years before his death in 1986. Jackson married Fern Josephine Payne (d. 1983) in 1933. They had no children. Jackson died in Cleveland and was buried at Highland Park Cemetery.  Education  After graduating from Zanesville High School, Jackson worked his way through Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) and eventually graduated magna cum laude.

Public service  Jackson was elected to the Ohio Legislature in 1928, called the General Assembly, as an active Republican. Jackson was the first African American to win a county-wide election in Cuyahoga County‚Äîthe County in which Cleveland, Ohio sits, which was at the time a bustling metropolis.

In 2002, he was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize by the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung. At the Freie Universit√§t in Berlin, founded in 1948, a chair in \\"the study of religion on the basis of the philosophy of religion\\" was created for Heinrich. Michael Stausberg, historian of the study of religion, says this of him: ‚ÄúHeinrich became famous in Berlin and beyond for his skills as an orator‚Äîbeing a speaker rather than a writer, many of his publications are reconstructed on the basis of recordings and notes of his students‚Äî, his teaching style, his immense learning and his political commitment to the ideals of a ‚Äòfree‚Äô university. His work, which adopts key- elements from Tillich (‚Äòorigins‚Äô) and Freud (‚Äòrepression‚Äô), moves in the borderland between Greek mythology (Oedipus!) and philosophy. Many of his texts provide a philosophical-psychoanalytical exegesis of myths that takes visual culture (modern arts, the Renaissance) as its point of departure. Heinrich's dense style, often difficult to follow for the non-initiates, won him the prestigious Sigmund Freud-Award for Scientific Prose in 2002. Heinrich's approach to the study of religion is too unique and personal to be copied by others, but he had many students who were fascinated by his charisma.‚ÄùStausberg, Michael. ‚ÄúThe Study of Religion(s) in Western Europe (II): Institutional Developments after World War II.‚Äù Religion 38.4 (2008) 305-18.

After Spanier‚Äôs death, Johanna married the hotel-owner Egbert Dijjers (1874-1948) and the family moved to The Hague.https://books.google.com/books?id=NLMaAQAAIAAJ&q;=lien+deyers&dq;=lien+deyers&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiE3se96eXoAhUPSa0KHcrGDJw4FBDoATACegQIARAR At the early age of five her potential was noted by Amsterdam theatre owner and film producer David Sluizer, but she did not enter the film business. Deyers spent most of her childhood years in The Hague until her stepfather, Dijjers, married the Austrian actress Lotte Erol. Lien then traveled between The Hague, Vienna (where the family mostly lived) and Lausanne, where she went to a private school and became fluent in French. Career In August 1926 the Austrian weekly Mein Film staged a competition for new young screen talent and Lien submitted her photograph. Together with twenty other contestants she was chosen for a screen-test by director Hans Otto, which she won. Subsequently, during an autograph session in the Mein Film offices in 1927, she was introduced to the well-known Austrian director Fritz Lang, who happened to be in need of a young blonde for a role in his new movie Spione, written by his wife, the novelist and screenwriter Thea von Harbou. Lang had her travel to Berlin for a screen test, and she was indeed given a secondary, racy role in Spione. She was billed as Lien Deyers because Dijjers frequently was misspelled or mispronounced in German-speaking countries. Lang had her sign a six-year contract to the UFA studios in Berlin. The contract soon turned out to be mere slavery, and Deyers sought a court decision to end it. In November 1928, the court ruled in her favor, a verdict welcomed by hundreds of Berlin- based actors with similar contracts. In turn Lang appealed and was granted a 10,000 Reichs-mark pay-off, to be fulfilled in monthly payments. Deyers and Lang already had grown to dislike each other during the shooting of Spione. She was featured in nine silent movies and 25 talkies over the following eight years, mostly comedies, some of them French productions. Her initial popularity, especially with women, was due to her sentimental role in William Dieterle's The Saint and Her Fool. In 1934, she married the American-born German producer and director Alfred Zeisler, who had worked in Germany since 1924. She had met him when he directed the movie Sein Scheidungsgrund, in which she played the main character. Starting with this movie, Deyers concentrated on comedy, only occasionally appearing in dramatic roles. Deyers got into conflict with the new politics of Nazi Germany: She had to take on German citizenship to remain assured of roles. She mainly was typecast for typical \\"Aryan\\" characters like the exemplary girlish blonde in The Company's in Love (1932) and Gold (1934). Most importantly, she feared the Nazis would discover she was half-Jewish (her father Spanier was Jewish). Because Zeisler was Jewish, too, they fled Germany in 1935. Zeisler settled in Britain, and in 1936, he directed Cary Grant in The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss. Deyers traveled between London and The Hague, and in 1937, she signed for a major role in the Dutch-Italian movie The Three Wishes. For unknown reasons, she did not play the part and joined her husband in London in 1938. By this time, their marriage was faltering and a divorce was inevitable. In 1939, the couple moved to California, where they soon divorced. Later years Deyers, who had a reputation of being \\"extremely mentally unstable\\", could not find work in Hollywood. There were many exiled German actors all vying for the few roles that required a foreign accent. She developed an alcohol addiction and relied financially on old contacts like the German actor and director William Dieterle and in particular the Austrian-American film agent Paul Kohner and his European Film Fund that he had founded to aid German actors in exile. Over a brief period, she married three more times: with kingpin actors' agent Frank Orsatti, one of the Orsatti Brothers (who evidently could not get her involved in movies either), from 1940 until 1942; with furrier Victor Rubin from 1944 to 1948; and with Lawrence Adlon, grandson of the Berlin hotel-magnate Lorenz Adlon in January 1951. The Dutch actor/comedian Wim Sonneveld met with her in 1957 during the shooting of Silk Stockings with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, in which he played a supporting role. He reportedly was shocked by her appearance. After 1957, she faded from public view. She was arrested in Las Vegas in 1964 for loitering and disorderly conduct, and she sent a greeting card congratulating German actor and former co-star Heinz R√ºhmann on his 80th birthday in 1982. The postcard was signed L. Dyers-Wallburg, suggesting she had married for a fifth time.

He was a member of Seanad √âireann from 1961 to 1981, and from 1982 to 1983. Early life McGlinchey was born to Patrick McGlinchey and his wife Sarah (n√©e O'Boyle) in 1932, and educated at St Eunan's College. He had six older siblings and one younger one. He was expelled from secondary school. Business career A restaurant proprietor, McGlinchey founded the Golden Grill Nightclub, renowned as the unofficial Fianna F√°il headquarters and venue of party conventions. He was a millionaire. Political career McGlinchey was first elected to the Seanad by the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 1961. At the 1973 election he was elected by the Administrative Panel, and he was nominated by the Taoiseach in 1977. He did not contest the 1981 election, but in 1982 was nominated by the Taoiseach to the 16th Seanad. At the start of his political career McGlinchey was closely linked with Neil Blaney. Paul M. Sacks, an American academic, wrote a book called The Donegal Mafia which detailed the actions of the two men and their team. He once debated for 12 hours, a Seanad √âireann record for the longest speech. McGlinchey stood for election to D√°il √âireann in the constituencies of Donegal North-East (1973, 1981, November 1982) and Donegal (1977), but was unsuccessful each time. He was a member of Donegal County Council for the Letterkenny area until 2004. McGlinchey is said to have \\"practically invented as a politician\\" Jim McDaid, selecting \\"the young, presentable McDaid\\" and setting him on the path for a career in national politics. McDaid achieved what McGlinchey could not, being elected to the D√°il on his first attempt at the 1989 general election, eventually serving in government, as Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation between 1997 and 2002 and as Minister of State for Transport between 2002 and 2004, and being re-elected to the D√°il at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2010. Personal life McGlinchey married Elizabeth and had five children: three daughters and two sons. One of his daughters, Adrienne McGlinchey, featured in the national media in 2002 in relation to the Carty Inquiry. She was born in 1965 in Letterkenny and shared a flat in Buncrana between 1991 and 1995 with Yvonne Devine, a Letterkenny woman who had been employed by a restaurant run by McGlinchey family members in the town. Adrienne McGlinchey was arrested several times in this period, though records seem to exist mainly of one arrest in July 1991. A Garda sergeant acquainted with her described her as \\"a Walter Mitty type of person\\". Bernard McGlinchey died at home, aged 80, on 11 April 2013. At the time of his death his partner was Kathleen Sweeney. Memorial Letterkenny Town Park is named after McGlinchey.

Biography Wagenaar was born in Amsterdam to a Mennonite master shoemaker of the same name and Maria Saftleven, a descendant of the landscape painter Herman Saftleven. He was schooled in reading and mathematics and finished his education at a French school in Amsterdam. He was known for his poems and made his first play at age twelve, which was published without his consent. In 1722 another poem was published in Haarlem that he wrote for the village sacristan of Zandvoort. He was apprenticed to a Catholic merchant and later became a wood trader, but having trained himself in historical subjects through intense reading of the classics, he became a writer. His most famous work is Vaderlandsche historie (Amsterdam, 1749-1760, 21 vols), which became so popular it was continued by others (Amsterdam 1788-1810, 52 vols). This work is on the list of 1000 most important texts in the Canon of Dutch Literature. For this work, he at first in 1736 refused to publish his name as author, first revealing himself in the 20th volume in 1759. Jacobus Houbraken made numerous engravings for these books, that were published by Isaak Tirion of Amsterdam. In addition to Vaderlandsche historie, he also wrote descriptions of the United States, the Netherlands (Amsterdam. 1739, 12 vols) and Amsterdam (ib. 1760, 3 vols).

The actress was thirteen when she was offered the role of Annie. She made her first screen appearance as Annie during the episode broadcast on 20 June 2007. Best left the serial in 2010, so she could concentrate on her studies. Annie was introduced to Home and Away along with her older brother, Geoff (Lincoln Lewis). Both teenagers were raised by their strict religious grandfather Bruce (Chris Haywood). Annie was an \\"innocent farm girl\\", who was also intelligent, \\"unusual\\" and impressionable. A notable storyline for the character involved her becoming trapped in a storm drain and being rescued by Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Annie began a flirtation with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell) and they briefly dated before she decided to leave for Japan as part of a student exchange programme. For her portrayal of Annie, Best was nominated for Most Popular New Female Talent at the 2008 Logie Awards. Casting Best was offered the role of Annie after she began studying at the Sydney performing arts school, Brent Street, where her talent agency, who helped her secure the part, is based. Best was thirteen when she joined the cast. Her family relocated from the Central Coast to Mosman, New South Wales , In early 2010, Best decided to leave the series to concentrate on her studies. Annie's exit storyline saw her leave Australia to study in Japan as part of an exchange student programme. In June that year, Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no plans for Best to reprise her role in the near future. Development Lincoln Lewis played Annie's brother Geoff. A writer from RT√â.ie said that Annie is a \\"innocent farm girl\\" who would \\"have her life turned on its head\\" upon her arrival. Annie was described on the serial's official website as being \\"bright and unusual\\". Annie and her brother Geoff (Lincoln Lewis) were raised by their \\"Bible-bashing\\" grandfather, Bruce (Chris Haywood), after their parents died. Annie is intelligent but has dyslexia and Bruce thought that she was \\"slow\\" and subsequently prevented her from going to school. They added that she is \\"a strange mix of knowing farm waif and innocent child, partly muddled by old-fashioned religious morality.\\" Annie can be a \\"handful\\" at times but school tamed her. She gradually transforms into a young woman and takes an interest in males. She is also \\"very protective\\" over Geoff. Lewis told a reporter from Inside Soap that Annie and Geoff have a \\"natural brother-and-sister chemistry\\" because they both have siblings off- screen and were able to relate to it. He added that their off-screen rapport; which consisted of them \\"taking the mickey\\" out of each other also helped. In one storyline Annie becomes trapped in a storm drain and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) attempts to save her. Anderson told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that \\"Annie's stuck down this drain, trapped behind a grille. To make matters worse there is a storm coming and the water level is rising.\\" With the rapid intake of water, Charlie cannot wait for the emergency services to arrive and dives in to save her. Anderson explained that her character only cares about getting Annie to safety and risks her life. She manages to free Annie, but is swept away by the current. Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) manages to save Charlie and they are all taken to safety. Off-screen storm drain scenes created many logistical challenges for the production team to overcome. They had a set built especially for the scenes and turbulent waves were created by jets placed under the water. Anderson added that \\"it was absolutely freezing. Filming was tough work, but I think the finished result is worth it.\\" Annie begins a \\"cute\\" flirtation with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), but it is cut short when she leaves Summer Bay for Japan. Annie later makes a surprise return and TV Week's Carolyn Stewart said it would give \\"the lovebirds a chance to rekindle the flame.\\" Best believed that while Romeo may have gotten over his sadness at Annie's departure, he would still be waiting and hoping for her to return. She further explained that while Annie stayed in contact with Romeo and she has grown up, it would not all be smooth sailing ‚Äì though there would be fun times ahead for them. In April 2010, Mitchell revealed that Romeo and Annie would go on their first date. He explained \\"Even though they have a history, they haven't been on an official date before, so Romeo asks her out and make a pretty special night for them.\\" Romeo gets the keys to the school theatre and organises a romantic setting for Annie. Mitchell believed the scenes would make some female viewers want their boyfriend's to do the same for them. Best agreed saying \\"We had so much fun filming their first date. It was really special. I think a lot of people are going to fall in love with Romeo all over again after watching it.\\" The actress promised viewers would enjoy her character's return, though she did not say how long she would be back for. She added that the storyline between Annie and Romeo would be very funny and intensely romantic to keep the audience on their toes. Storylines Annie and her brother Geoff find Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) camped out in the paddock on their farm and they give her a lift back to Summer Bay. Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) enquires about Annie's schooling and Bruce tells her Annie is being home schooled, but it soon becomes apparent that Bruce is lying. Annie enrols at Summer Bay High and Lucas Holden (Rhys Wakefield) helps her, but Geoff sees Lucas as a bad person and continually argues with him. After falling asleep due to farm work and study one day, Annie crashes out on Lucas' bed and is found by Bruce who assumes the worst and drags her home. Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) notices Annie has a crush on Lucas and mentions to her that Lucas lost his virginity to her; which horrifies Annie. Matters are made worse when Belle gives her a teen magazine with a sealed sex and relationships section, which Bruce mistakes for pornography. Annie is then locked in her room after being ordered to pray for forgiveness. After Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) learns of Annie's imprisonment, he forces Bruce to release her and Annie and Geoff move in with him and Lucas. Annie complains of being in pain and bleeding one day and assumes she is dying, but Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) discovers she is beginning her menstrual cycle and convinces Tony to let Annie move in with her and Belle. Annie and Geoff are reconciled with Bruce after he suffers a heart attack and is hospitalised but Bruce dies after suffering a second heart attack, leaving Annie and Geoff devastated as he was the only family they had following their parents' deaths. Annie loses her faith after local Reverend John Hall (Paul Tassone) dies following botched brain surgery and she gets drunk. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) finds her and is blamed for her condition as he previously supplied Tamsyn Armstrong (Gabrielle Scollay) with alcohol. Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) convinces Annie to tell the truth and Aden is exonerated. Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) arrives in the Bay and befriends Annie. When Jai begins doing dangerous stunts, Annie is injured while performing a similar stunt to show him how it affects people who care about him; they are forbidden from seeing each other. Irene and Jai's foster father, Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart) eventually relent. Annie is worried that Jai wants a sexual relationship with her, but he sets her straight. The couple are nearly killed when Kane Phillips' (Sam Atwell) car swerves to avoid Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell) and crashes into the school. Annie and Jai break up when Jai reveals he does want to take their relationship further. Things are strained further when Irene suffers an alcoholic relapse after being wrongly imprisoned for killing her new partner Lou De Bono (David Roberts). Annie tries to pour away Irene's alcohol and is slapped for doing so. Dexter Walker (Tom Green) supports Annie when she learns Belle is dying of cancer. Following Belle's death, Annie is touched when Dexter arranges an album of photos Belle had taken and kisses him. They begin dating in secret so they do not hurt Jai, but he finds out. Dexter and his family leave the Bay and Annie becomes attracted to Jai's friend, Romeo Smith. They begin dating, but the relationship is cut short when Annie and Jai are both accepted into the student exchange program. Annie returns several months later and resumes things with Romeo when they spend time together working on a reversed gender performance of Romeo and Juliet. After things fail to develop further, Annie returns to Japan. Reception For her portrayal of Annie, Best was nominated in the category of Most Popular New Female Talent at the 2008 Logie Awards. A writer from Holy Soap described her most memorable moment as \\"finally breaking out of her tough grandfather's shadow and becoming a Summer Bay woman.\\" When it was revealed that Bruce had a heart condition, a writer for the Daily Record commented \\"the thought of shy-as-a-mouse teen Annie getting embroiled in a fight would be enough to do the old man in. Sadly, the youngster does lash out, but at least she's justified ‚Äì she has a go at a school bully. Perhaps Bruce's decision to keep the youngster and her brother away from society wasn't such a bad one?\\" Another columnist from the Daily Record said that Annie's drinking binges that occurred when she began losing her faith were \\"drastic measures\\". A reporter from the same paper called Annie \\"impressionable\\" and quipped that she wandered around the Bay \\"with her tongue hanging out\\" when she met the \\"stylish and confident\\" Nicole Franklin. Annie was also branded a busybody and a \\"feeble-minded teenager\\" by writers for the paper.

According to the Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Literature he was nominated 15 times without being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Life Ant√≥nio Correia de Oliveira was born in S√£o Pedro do Sul, in the district of Viseu, in 1879. He studied at the Seminary of Viseu, then went to Lisbon, where he worked briefly as a journalist at the Illustrated Diary. He published his first work at the age of 16, Ladainha in 1897. He was a companion of Raul Brand√£o and was influenced by Antero de Quental and Guerra Junqueiro. In 1912, having married, he settled in the parish of Antas, municipality of Esposende, going to live for the Quinta do Belinho. He was a poet, was one of the singers of Saudosismo, along with Teixeira de Pascoaes and others. He was connected to the cultural movements of Lusitanian Integralism and the magazines. He was decidedly monarchical, he became one of the unofficial poets of the Estado Novo, with numerous texts chosen for the unique Portuguese-language books of the primary and secondary education system. Correia de Oliveira was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature for the first time in 1933, having been nominated a total of fifteen times in nine years (1933 to 1940 and 1942). The same winner of 1945, the Chilean Gabriela Mistral, who had served as Cultural Attach√© in Lisbon, publicly stated in the solemn act that he did not deserve the prize, with the author of Verbo Ser and Verbo Amar being present. He was the third Portuguese to be nominated for Nobel Of Literature, after Jo√£o da C√¢mara in 1901 and Jo√£o Bonan√ßa in 1907, but he is the Portuguese who is known for the greatest number of nominations, along with Maria Madalena de Martel Patr√≠cio who has fourteen.

He died in the Battle of Jutland during World War I. Biography Fisher was born on 19 June 1877 in Blatchington Court, Blatchington, Sussex, England, and baptised in East Blatchington on 4 August 1877. He was ninth of the eleven children of Herbert William Fisher (1826‚Äì1903) and his wife Mary Louisa (n√©e Jackson) (1841‚Äì1916). His siblings included: H. A. L. Fisher, historian and Minister of Education; Admiral Sir William Wordsworth Fisher, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; Florence Henrietta, Lady Darwin, playwright and wife of Sir Francis Darwin (son of Charles Darwin); and Adeline Vaughan Williams, wife of English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Fisher was educated at Westminster School, matriculating to Christ Church, Oxford in 1896, where he gained his B.A. in 1900 and his M.A. in 1903. A fine cricketer, he represented Sussex County Cricket Club since 1898 and he played in the University eleven in 1899 and 1900. He was elected Tutor in Christ Church in 1903 and served as Senior Censor from 1910 to 1914, described as one of Oxford's \\"most prominent members of its educational staff\\". Fond of exercise, he liked hiking through the Austrian Alps and also undertook long walking tours through Italy with the aim of better appreciating the Roman historian Cornelius Tacitus. He had already edited two of Tacitus's works, his Annals and Histories, for the Clarendon Press, and his texts were described as \\"models of sense and clearness\\"; he was following this by writing a commentary on the Histories as a companion to Henry Furneaux's edition of the Annals. At the start of World War I in 1914 he learnt to drive, joined the Royal Army Medical Corps Motor Ambulance and served on the Western Front as orderly and interpreter, distinguishing himself for bravery under fire. He then underwent a short period of training, and joined the Royal Navy in August 1915. He was lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and was serving on HMS Invincible when she was sunk in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 with the loss of 1026 lives. The biographer of his sister Adeline's husband describes Charles Fisher as \\"brilliant and most dashing of Adeline's brothers\\" and tells how his death was \\"a blow from which she never recovered\\". An obituary in The Times described him as a \\"lovable man, big, handsome, manly, noble\\", with \\"penetrating judgment\\" and \\"refreshing frankness\\", who \\"hated shams, and knew a good man when he saw him\\". It concludes, \\"His college mourns in him one of the best she has known. If it had not been for the existing necessity of holy orders, it is in Charles Fisher that Christ Church would naturally have expected to find its next Dean.\\" Cricket career Fisher played first-class cricket from 1898 to 1903, making 21 appearances, mainly for Sussex and also for Oxford University Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club. He was a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm medium pace and off break. He scored 429 career runs with a highest score of 80, against Worcestershire at Hove in 1901, and took eight career wickets with a best performance of two for 8. In his Wisden obituary, Fisher was described as 6 ft. 3in. in height and \\"a safe and steady batsman\\". He was a consistent bowler who could maintain a good length in his deliveries. At Westminster, he was in the school's first eleven for the four years 1893 to 1896 and captain in the last three. He obtained his Blue at Oxford in 1900 and played in the University Match that year.

Life Chadwick was born in Newcroft House in Urmston, Lancashire, and educated at Stretford School before moving to Bolton at the age of 14 to live with a doctor uncle in Sweet Green. Chadwick himself then decided to study medicine at the University of London in 1828, becoming a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS). He returned to Lancashire and set up a practice in Wigan, moving to Bolton in 1837 to succeed his uncle. To improve his medical knowledge and skills he went to Ireland for two years, qualifying as a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons (LRCS), and Scotland for one year, qualifying LRCS of Edinburgh. After further study he was awarded the degree of MD in Edinburgh. He again returned to Bolton and established an eye clinic and an ear, nose and throat clinic and became honorary surgeon at Bolton Hospital. He donated ¬£5000 towards the building of the Chadwick ear, nose and throat ward. His surgical skill resulted in his election as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. He provided the funds to set up a Mechanics Institute and gave lectures on public health issues. Further donations enabled houses to be built for people living in cellars. He was elected to Bolton Council and fought for better public health provisions such as cleaner water, established the Chadwick Orphanage which could house 80 girls and improved the Bolton Workhouse. He donated money to establish a natural history museum in the town's Queen's Park, which was the basis of the present Bolton Museum now relocated to the town centre.

It was named for two Gapen√ßais hockey players, Roger Brown and John Ferrand. Locally, it is also known as \\"La Bl√¢che,\\" for the neighborhood where the arena is located. It is the home rink of the Ligue Magnus team, the Rapaces de Gap (English: Gap Raptors), History Inside the rink The arena was opened in 1955, and renovated in several stages since then. In 1962 a refrigeration system (based on ammonia) was commissioned to produce artificial ice. The same year, the mayor gave the club a central forum and concrete bleachers. Until 1972, when the rink was covered by a roof resting on a laminated steel tray frame, the ice was directly subjected to natural weather. In 1977 the galleries were built between the central platform and the southeast corner. 5 years later, the current building was built, including dressing rooms and a bar upstairs. In 1985, the lighting was rebuilt and in 1987, work was undertaken to repair the slab and refrigeration. New Arena Following an audit in 2005, the former mayor of Gap, Pierre Bernard-Reymond, formed a committee to discuss a new arena. In July 2007, the new arena was announced by Roger Didier. The project involves extending the existing ice rink and the creation of a complex of trails. The Patinoire Brown-Ferrand will be redesigned and enlarged, with the capacity increased to 2000 instead of 1800 seats, with spectators sitting all around the ice. The new arena design features 5 luxury suites, 7 locker rooms, a public skating rink, gym, and a cafeteria/bar. In addition, it is designed to be a green-friendly structure, with all the heat generated in cooling the ice used to directly provide heat to other areas of the facility. The construction is projected to be complete in August 2012, with opening scheduled for 1 September 2012.

After growing up in the Portland area, he attended Occidental College and completed his bachelor's degree in literature and writing at the University of Oregon. He earned his M.D. from Oregon Health and Science University in 1977.

Awards include the Menninger Alumni Association Scientific Writing Award in 1980, the Linacre Award for Excellence in Medical Journalism in 2002, and Distinguished Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association in 2003. Object Relations Theory and Psychiatry Hamilton's approach to object relations theory as described in Self and Others: Object Relations Theory in Practice, first published in 1988, was integrative. He originally described object relations theory as having an important place in psychiatry's biopsychosocial model but as not being a complete psychology for the broader field of psychiatry in that it lacked explanations of the effects of physical and cognitive factors on internal and external relationships. In 1996, with the publication of The Self and the Ego in Psychotherapy, he added specific ego functions, including cognitions, and physical factors into the concept of object relations units in an attempt to make object relations theory sufficiently inclusive to serve as a general framework for psychiatry and clinical psychology.

Family Robert Graham was the third son of Patrick Graham of Kincardine. He attended the University of Paris in the 1390s, potentially in preparation for entering the priesthood. In 1399 he married Marion Oliphant, daughter of John Oliphant of Aberdalgie. Robert's brother Sir Patrick Graham (died 1413) acquired the Earldom of Strathearn through his 1406 marriage to Euphemia Stewart, Countess of Strathearn. Robert became tutor to his nephew, Malise Graham. He is described as \\"a grete gentilman... a man of grete wit and eloquence, wounder suttilye willyd and expert in the lawe\\". The Grahams were supporters of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, and his son Murdoch. When Murdoch and his two sons were executed by James I in 1425, Robert Graham was imprisoned in Dunbar Castle, but was free by 1428. Around 1425, James I deprived Malise Graham of the Earldom of Strathearn, on the pretext that he had inherited from his mother. At the time, Malise was a minor and was also being held hostage in England. Some say this action which turned Robert Graham against his King although others question such a motivation. The earldom was granted to Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, the uncle of James I, and Robert appears to have continued in the service of the new Earl. Walter was next in line to the throne, and, though a distant relation, Graham's nephew - Malise - was the next in line after Walter. Walter and Robert both had further grievances against the King, and worked together to bring about his murder which was carried out by Graham. Assassination of James I In 1436, after a disastrous military expedition to Roxburgh, Sir Robert denounced the monarch in Parliament, and attempted to arrest him. He was arrested and imprisoned, but escaped. A conspiracy was formed between Sir Robert, the Earl of Atholl, and Atholl's grandson Robert Stewart. On the night of 20 February 1437, James was lodging in the Dominican Friary in Perth. Robert Stewart allowed the conspirators, including Sir Robert Graham and his son Thomas, into the lodging. Although the King attempted to hide in a drain, he was discovered and stabbed to death. Sir Robert is said to have dealt the fatal blow. The assassins escaped, but without killing the Queen, Joan Beaufort, who quickly assumed power as regent for the young James II. There was no wider support for the conspiracy, and the King's assassins were soon rounded up and brutally executed. Sir Robert was discovered in Perthshire and brought to Stirling, where he was executed in April. In 17th-century litigation surrounding the Earl of Airth and his claim on the Earldom of Strathearn, it was argued by the Crown that to recognise the Earl of Airth's claim would be a justification of Sir Robert Graham's murder of the King. However, more recent historians have doubted that the deprivation of Malise Graham was such a strong motivation for Sir Robert's actions.

Life Unnerstad was born in Helsinki, Finland, the daughter of Swedes Axel and Ingeborg T√∂tterman. In 1908, when she was eight years old, her grandmother, a pilot's widow in √Öland, died. The T√∂tterman family left Helsinki and moved to the grandmother's house on √Öland which her mother had inherited. In 1910, the family moved to Sweden and settled in S√∂dert√§lje, and in 1912 they moved to Stockholm. After the First World War the family moved back to Aland. Writing later, she referred to an observation by the British children's writer A. A. Milne that children's writers are created early: \\"Perhaps Mr. Milne was right. Very likely the pattern for my future profession was already minutely drawn when I was seven or eight.\\" Unnerstad's own literary career began when her sister was hospitalized with scarlet fever and requested something to read. Afraid that her family's much loved books would not return safely from the hospital as they would have to pass through disinfection ovens, the 11-year-old Unnerstad decided to write her sister a new book instead. She wrote new chapters daily, and delivered each to the hospital on her way to school. According to Unnerstad \\"The 'book', if I remember right, turned out to a horrifying mixture evidently inspired by my idols at the time: Cooper, Jules Verne, Captain Marryat and Swedish Finland's great old story-teller, Topelius.....After that there was no turning back.\\" Three years later, she had two poems and a story published in a magazine, and spent the proceeds on a pair of patent-leather pumps, a bag of toffee and a copy of Atala by Chateaubriand. Unnerstad attended Detthowska School and art school in Stockholm. In 1924, Unnerstad married a civil engineer Arvid B. Unnerstad. They had a daughter, Lena. Literary career Despite her early start and a continuing desire to be an author, Unnerstad's career was delayed by, in her own words \\"studies, art studies, public service, marriage, a baby, travels in many countries.\\" She also did not realize that her gift was children's fiction until her own daughter was old enough to ask her mother for stories. Her first book, Ufle reser jorden runt, was published in 1932. In the following years, she wrote many works of children and adult fiction and poetry; as she herself noted, \\"my favorite theme has been the same: CHILDHOOD.\\" Unnerstad later described her grandmother and mother, who were both excellent story tellers, as influential to her writing. In particular, their tales of past childhood in the past, as well as her own experiences of childhood, motherhood and grandmotherhood, influenced her stories. She continued \\"But above all I think the plain truth is: I was once a child, and the child I was, in many respects, I still am. That's why I know, and that's why I love to write about it.\\" Edith Unnerstad is particularly known for a series of children's books written about the Pip-Larsson family. These include The Saucepan Journey, Little O, The Urchin and The Pip-Larssons Go Sailing, all of which were translated in English. Unnerstad's books often have a theme of cohesive families and friends. Unnerstad explored the traditional craft of hair weaving in two of her books. From 1830 till the First World War, the Dalecarlia region of Sweden was famous for the production of ornaments and trinkets woven from hair, and women from the region travelled throughout Europe to sell their creations. The Journey with Grandmother tells the story of just such a trip to Czarist Russia, which Unnerstad researched by travelling to the Soviet Union, just after the end of Joseph Stalin's regime. Her Russian tour guide in Leningrad, with some reluctance, permitted her to visit some relevant areas. The book A Journey to England also features hairweaving: two children travel to England to find their mother who has disappeared on a hairweaving trip to the United Kingdom. She also wrote novels for adults and radio, television, and movie scripts. Unnerstad's books were translated into English and formed part of a wave of Scandinavian and in particular Swedish books which were influential in English-language children's literature after the Second World War. Her book The Saucepan Journey were adapted for the Swedish screen in 1950 and in 1998 in a Swedish TV series called Pip-Larsson. She received the 1957 Nils Holgersson Plaque for her book Journey with Grandmother. Her husband died in 1971. Unnerstad died on 29 December 1982 in Djursholm.

Biography=Early years Lohani was born in Lakhanpur-8, Rangapur Village of Jhapa district, Nepal to father Sharada Prashad Lohani and mother Harimaya Lohani. He was Sharada Prashad and Harimaya's second child, out of their five children. Known to be an average student, he attended a government school for his secondary education before going to the capital city Kathmandu to join college at Nepal Law Campus with major in Law. He later attended National College of Bangalore in Bangalore, India to receive his LLM degree. Career Soon after returning Nepal from Bangalore, he established his legal firm Legal Research Associates in Kathmandu, at the same time attending Nepal Law Campus for further studies. His career as a television personality began when he started doing a political talk-show named Bahas in the national television of Nepal. With his strict professional nature and the habit of straight forward questioning, he soon attracted extreme attention from the viewers who would eagerly wait for him to provoke critical issues, especially while interviewing politicians, in his talk-shows. During the period of monarchy, before 2006 revolutions, his show in the government-controlled Nepal Television started getting heavily censored due to his straight questions to the politicians in his interviews. This led him to quit the show at Nepal Television, but soon starting the show in a privately controlled television, Kantipur Television, under the name Kantipur Bahas. The show still remained a favorite to its viewers and attracted even more attention after the peoples' revolution of 2006 when people had renewed interests in the country's changing politics. He is also known as a social worker and reformer. His reports from flood-stricken parts of eastern Nepal, where he also participated in rescue activities together with Nepal Army, are considered as heroic by many. He is known to have made efforts to bring infrastructural development in education and other fields in villages and rural areas of the country. Even after his death his family has been contributing for social and religious causes, which they say is made in Lohani's memory.http://hamrakura.com/en/5299.html Personal life Lohani was married to Sushma Dubedi on 24 April 1999. The couple has two daughters, Samragi and Subhangi. Death Lohani's demise occurred possibly due to a cardiac arrest, around 8 pm on 16 January 2009. Doctors had reported of no signs of external injuries on Lohani¬¥s body. Lohani was suffering from a liver condition medically known as fatty liver and was also a blood pressure patient. Earlier, on the day of his demise, Lohani had complained of discomfort while visiting a temple with his daughter and had fainted for a while. After regaining consciousness, he had asked locals to drop him at home. He died while being rushed from his house to the hospital. He was brought dead at Norvic International Hospital in Kathmandu at 8:10 p.m.http://anlus.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/indra-lohani-passes-away-details/ His funeral was attended by thousands of people at the Pashupati Temple Cremation Area.

The book, published in 1842 in London, was written during eight years of travel from 1832 to 1839 and contains many of Catlin‚Äôs illustrations. The book is divided into letters written by Catlin, rather than chapters, with some letters containing information about the same regions. Title Page of Volume 1 of Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians by George Catlin Summary=Volume 1 Volume 1 is 264 pages and contains 31 letters. The first letter serves as an introduction to Catlin‚Äôs life, setting up the writings on his travels. He then travels to the mouth of the Yellowstone River and then to a Mandan village. He writes several letters about the Mandan village before writing about his travels to a Minataree village. The final letters of the first volume describe the mouth of the Teton River. =Letter 1: Introduction= This first letter is written to serve as an introduction and is actually written after the others to give the reader background information. In it, Catlin tells the reader he was born in Wyoming, Pennsylvania to parents that moved to the area shortly after the Revolutionary War and the \\"Indian Massacre.\\" He followed in his father's footsteps and became a lawyer, but eventually gave that up to become an artist in Philadelphia. He starts for the west in 1832, and tells of what he hopes his book will do, saying \\"I send forth these volumes at this time, fresh and full of their living deeds and customs, as a familiar and unstudied introduction (at least) to them and their native characters; which I confidently hope will repay the readers who read for information and historical facts, as well as those who read but for amusement.\\".Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York In this letter, he also tells the reader the proper way to approach Indians and his thoughts on their probable eventual extinction based on the history of the number of people in the tribes. =Letters 2‚Äì9: Mouth of the Yellow Stone= In these letter he takes note of the beauty of the area, and also learns about buffalo hunting. He makes multiple illustrations of the animal itself, along with a piece that illustrates the actual act of hunting and killing the buffalo. He also learns about the Blackfoot nation (letter 5), even painting the head chief. The line cut can be seen at the very end of letter 4. In the narrative, he mentions their costumes, dynamics between Blackfeet, their weapons (lances, bows, shields, and arrows), and mentions several distinguished Blackfeet. In letter 6, he mainly writes of medicine used in the tribes of the region, learning the nature of medicine bags, how to form them, and of their value. During the time of these letters, he also meets and learns about the Crow and their lifestyle, comparing their language with the Blackfeet.Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York George Catlin's portrait of the head chief of the Blackfoot Nation =Letters 10‚Äì22; 25: Mandan Village= These letters start with Catlin's journey to the Mandan, noting what he sees, such as the beautiful flowers and animals such as mountain sheep and grizzly bears, as well as what happens, such as his canoe being robbed and what he calls a \\"courageous attack.\\" Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York After arriving in the village, he writes about the history and formation of the Mandan's locations. Based on the number of letters dedicated to the Mandan and their village, he learns all he can about the people and customs of this region, including: * Constructing their wigwams along with description of interior * Weapons * Jokes * Story-telling * The \\"Big Canoe\\" * Medicine Lodge * The Dead ** Respect of the dead ** Visiting the dead ** Feeding the dead ** Converse with the dead ** Bones of the dead * The Wolf Chief * The Head Chief * Personal Appearances * Hair of the men and women * Bathing and Swimming * Costumes and Headdresses * Polygamy * Marriage * Medicine * Dancing ** Buffalo Dance * Feasting * Fasting * Horses * Ceremonies Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York He also writes about the Mandan people's reactions to his painting. They are intrigued by his art, but also have superstitious fears about it. =Letters 23-24: Minataree Village= Catlin learns about the origin and history of the Minataree villages and their old chief, Black Moccasin. He learns about the buffalo that surround the village, and writes on how the tribe cuts and transports the meat they hunt.Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York =Letters 26‚Äì31:Mouth of Teton River= Catlin notices the Sioux are also both interested and apprehensive about his painting, saying that the women are particularly difficult to paint portraits of. He notes some Sioux chiefs (Ha- wan-je-tah and Shoo-de-ga-cha and wife) and writes about Sioux early marriages. Some more aspects of Sioux life he learns about include: * Indian vanity * Buffalo ** Hunting ** Amount killed (1400) * Dance ** Bear dance ** Beggars dance ** Scalp dance Catlin, George (1842), https://archive.org/stream/lettersnotesonma00catl#page/8/mode/2up, New York Reviews=American Indian Quarterly by Robert W. Richmond This review was prompted by a new edition of the narrative that included an introduction by Marjorie Halpin. He notes the upgrade of photographic reproductions of Catlin's artwork instead of the line cuts in previous editions. Richmond praises Catlin's work, saying he \\"deserves admiration\\" for his accurate and non-romanticized accounts and artwork. He also thinks that even though Catlin's art will never be seen as masterpieces, it is nonetheless fantastic in its detail.Richmond, Robert W.

He was named Zambian captain in 1966 and at the end of the season was voted Zambian Sportsman of the Year. Mwikuta was one of the first Zambians to play professional football abroad when he signed for American club Atlanta Chiefs in 1967, together with Emment Kapengwe and Freddie Mwila. He became the first player born and raised in Africa to play in the NFL when he featured for the Dallas Cowboys in the 1970 pre-season as a placekicker. Playing career Mwikuta was born in Ndola on 20 June 1941 and was brought up by his elder brother after losing both parents at the age of two. He went to Chimoto and Fiwale Mission Schools for his primary education before moving to Bancroft (Chililabombwe) in 1957 where he joined the mine. He first played schools football and then joined Bancroft Blades, graduating to the first team by 1958 as a full-back or half-back. In the same season, he was chosen to represent the Rest of Northern Rhodesia against Katanga in Elizabethville in Congo and from then on was a permanent fixture in the Northern Rhodesian or Zambian sides.Anon. \\"America Here We Come ‚Äì Howard Mwikuta, Captain of Zambia and Broken Hill Warriors\\" Times of Zambia, 11 January, p.10 The determined tackler was part of the first team that played under the name Zambia, winning the Mufulu (Freedom) Cup in Malawi in July 1964 with wins over Tanganyika (Tanzania) and the hosts. He also featured in the Zambian team that hosted Kenya, Uganda and Ghana during Zambia's independence celebrations in October of the same year. The powerfully built Mwikuta not only had the stamina to keep running for 90 minutes and beyond, he was also famous for his long throw- ins and packed a powerful shot. In 1965, he switched to Broken Hill Warriors and the following year he was made captain of the club. He led the team to the Castle Cup final and to third position in the league after a second from bottom finish in 1965. He also captained Zambia in Malawi in a tournament staged by the hosts to celebrate the country's achievement of republic status in July 1966, which Zambia won after beating Madagascar 3‚Äì0 and the hosts 6‚Äì0.Anon. \\"Zambia wins Malawian soccer trophies\\", Times of Zambia, 10 July 1966, p.10 He also led Zambia to a Rothmans Cup triumph over Kenya in September 1966. He made 17 international appearances from July 1964 to the end of 1966. When Phil Woosnam, coach of Atlanta Chiefs in the newly introduced Professional Soccer League in America came to Zambia for the second time in December 1966, he approached Mwikuta, Mwila and Kapengwe on behalf of Chiefs. Mwikuta's deal was rushed through club, National Football League (NFL) and Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) executives in less than a week. Woosnam made the most attractive offer made to Zambian players at the time: close to ¬£200 per month plus bonuses, with one-year contracts upon successful conclusion of a two-month trial. Mwikuta accepted the offer and promised to return to Zambia to pass on what he would learn to the younger generation. In fact, he had been saving up for a trip to Britain later in the year where he hoped to see some top class European football and all of a sudden, he found himself with an all expenses paid trip and the chance of a lifetime. Kamphodza, Sam \\"My mind is made up says Howard Mwikuta,\\" Times of Zambia, 25 January 1967, p.10 After clarification of FIFA's recognition of the American league, Mwikuta left for Atlanta with Kapengwe, Mwila and Chief's scout Doug Sammons on 22 February 1967,Anon. \\"Atlanta, Here We Come\\", Times of Zambia, 23 February 1967, p.12 becoming the first Zambian players to play professional soccer abroad. Mwikuta impressed Chiefs' coaching staff with his fitness, often waiting for the rest of the players to catch up during training runs. Chief's assistant coach Vic Crowe once told him \\"We will have to start you running an hour ahead of time so that everyone is even when training begins.\\"Anon. \\"Howard's fitness amazes the Americans\\", Times of Zambia, 23 September 1967, p.15 He missed some early season games for illness and the last few with an ankle injury, playing 22 games for Chiefs and scoring one goal against Toronto. At the end of the season, Kapengwe and Mwila were re- signed so Mwikuta again left Zambia on 22 December 1967 for the US, sponsoring himself for a course in physical education and soccer coaching because he realised that Zambia badly needed professional coaches. In Atlanta, he found that the youngsters soccer skills far behind their Zambian age-mates so he starting coaching. \\"In my country, kids begin to play soccer at the age of five,\\" he told his American friends. It pained him to see kids idling about, when they could do something in their spare time ‚Äì like play soccer ‚Äì but he also saw there was need for qualified help. He postponed formal coursework and got a hands-on sporting job with the city of Atlanta Recreation Department. He carried in his car a supply of soccer balls and through this interaction and word of mouth he had a following coaching football in Atlanta. His work with the youngsters the community was praised.

Geographic range and habitat C. vandijki is found in Myanmar, specifically the Irrawaddy and Chindwin river drainages, and northwestern Thailand. www.reptile-database.org. It is possible that it lives in the Sittaung River as well. Ecology and behavior Barely anything is known about the ecology of C. vandijki in the wild, other than that it is fully aquatic. Conservation The conservation status of C. vandijki has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN, but populations are believed to be declining due to overharvesting for southern Chinese food markets. It is believed that establishing a protected area around parts of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers would help this species, but it has not been done yet. People have also struggled to successfully keep C. vandijki in captivity. On July 23, 2018, members of the TSA's and WCS's turtle conservation program in Myanmar excavated the nests of female C.vandijki on the banks of the Chindwin River in order to translocate them to a protected hatchery in Linpha Village. The program also incubated eggs from the critically endangered Burmese roofed turtle (Batagur trivittata). 67 individual Burmese narrow-headed softshell turtles from the program hatched on September 30.

Oracle America, Inc. is an ongoing legal case within the United States related to the nature of computer code and copyright law. The dispute centers on the use of parts of the Java programming language's application programming interfaces (APIs), which are owned by Oracle (through subsidiary, Oracle America, Inc., originating from Sun Microsystems), within early versions of the Android operating system by Google. Google has admitted to using the APIs, and has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine, but argues their original use of the APIs was within fair use. Oracle initiated the suit arguing that the APIs were copyrightable, seeking in damages from Google's sales and licensing of the earlier infringing versions of Android. While two District Court-level jury trials have found in favor of Google, the Federal Circuit court has reversed both decisions, asserting APIs are copyrightable and Google's application of them failed a fair use defense. Google successfully petitioned to the Supreme Court to hear the case in the 2019 term, focusing on the copyrightability of APIs and subsequent fair use. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the oral hearings in the case were delayed until the start of the 2020 term. The case is of significant interest within the tech and software industries, as numerous computer programs and software libraries, particularly in open source, are developed by recreating the functionality of APIs from commercial or competing products to aid developers in interoperability between different systems or platforms.  Background  Java was originally developed at Sun Microsystems starting in December 1990. It included a new programming language, a virtual machine, and a set of libraries for use with the language. These libraries are documented for programmers via application programming interfaces (APIs), which tell programmers what information to provide to library functions and what results to expect back, eliminating any need for the programmer to know how the library they are using does what it does. These libraries together provide the \\"Java virtual machine\\" which programmers write programs to use (run upon). The common way in which a common set of libraries are used across all \\"Java virtual machines\\" allows for interoperability, or as marketed by Sun, \\"Write once, run anywhere\\"; a programmer need only create one version of their software which, because of the single group of APIs common to all Java virtual machines, can thus be run on any computing platform that supports Java. The Java language was released to the public in 1995, under the Sun Community Source License, making the source code freely available but requiring that products using the code were maintained to the Java standard, and that any commercial derivative works were licensed by Sun. While anyone could program in the language itself, Sun maintained the Java Platform, Standard Edition and Mobile Edition libraries, provided to users as pre-compiled Java bytecode, and their respective APIs, as well as the Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs) that tested an implementation against the Java standard. Over 2006 and 2007, due to pressure from developers, Sun changed the license of the various Java packages to use the GNU General Public License with a \\"classpath exception\\", allowing developers the access necessary to make derivative works and the ability to release applications under a different license. This led to the OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit), first released in 2007. Sun retained strong control over the language and standards itself, licensing the necessary elements like TCKs for commercial users. At this time, Sun's business model changed to focusing on licensing of the Java platform to embedded devices, particularly mobile phones, and had already made licensing deals with Nokia, Motorola, and Research In Motion. Android, Inc. was founded in 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White to develop a mobile phone platform. Google purchased Android in 2005 and continued developing the Android operating system. During the development of Android, Google wanted to incorporate the Java Standard Edition libraries. Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt had approached Sun's president Jonathan I. Schwartz about licensing the Java libraries for use in Android. Sun offered a licensing deal of between . Schmidt said Google would have paid for that license, but they were concerned that Sun had also requested some shared control of Android along with the fee. Google states that they wanted more control in order to open source the language and allow third parties to take better advantage of its code; Oracle states that Sun refused because Google's intention was essentially to fork Java to a Google version of the language, and to prevent it being inter-operable with other versions, an idea which was \\"anathema\\" to the \\"write once run anywhere\\" basis of the language.Ruling, para 34: \\" The point of contention between the parties was Google's refusal to make the implementation of its programs compatible with the Java virtual machine or interoperable with other Java programs. Because Sun/Oracle found that position to be anathema to the \\"write once, run anywhere\\" philosophy, it did not grant Google a license to use the Java API packages.\\" Because of these differences of view, the negotiations failed to reach a deal and Sun refused Google a license for Java. At this point in time, the OpenJDK implementation offered by Sun was not as mature or complete as the Java Standard Edition. Instead of licensing Java, Google chose to develop a cleanroom version of the Java Standard Edition libraries, developing the libraries from a completely fresh start without any access to Sun's code. This became the engine behind Android's Dalvik virtual machine, a core part of the new system. Part of the virtual machine included 37 API calls and around 11,500 lines of code deemed central to Java, which were taken from Apache Harmony, an open-source cleanroom Java implementation developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Prior to this, the ASF had tried to obtain necessary licenses from Sun to support the Apache Harmony project as to call it an official Java implementation, but could not in part due to incompatible licensing with Java's GNU General Public License and ASF's Apache License, nor could it gain access to the Java TCKs to validate the Harmony project against Sun's implementation. Though Google stated they used this code to ensure interoperability with the Java Standard Edition for other programmers, during the second appeal hearing, Google stated that it had used this code for commercial reasons to rapidly complete Android and to avoid the \\"drudgery\\" of recreating the code. ASF ceased maintaining the Apache Harmony in 2011, leading Google to take over maintenance of these libraries. Google released a beta of the Android platform on November 5, 2007 then, one week later, the software development kit (SDK) which they noted included some Java technologies. Sun's president Schwartz congratulated Google the same day, saying they had \\"strapped another set of rockets to the community's momentum and to the vision defining opportunity across our (and other) planets.\\" During the trial, Schwartz said that at that time of Android's release, despite knowing Google may have bypassed their licensing requirements, \\"we decided to grit our teeth and support it so anyone supporting it would see us as part of the value chain\\". Oracle announced it would purchase Sun in April 2009 for , and completed the acquisition in January 2010. Besides allowing them to enter the hardware business, Oracle's CEO Larry Ellison called the acquisition of the Java language \\"the single most important software asset we have ever acquired\\". Oracle continued to develop Java and pursue licensing opportunities following its acquisition of Sun.  First phase: API copyrightability and patents  The first phase of the case lasted from 2010 to 2015. Oracle successfully established that APIs can be copyrightable, but their claims of patent infringement were refused. The Supreme Court declined to review these rulings, so they are now final.  First District Court trial  William Alsup, who presided over both trials at the District Court level On August 13, 2010, Oracle sued Google for copyright and patent infringement in the District Court for the Northern District of California. Oracle asserted Google was aware that they had developed Android without a Java license and copied its APIs, and that Google therefore infringed Oracle's copyright. Oracle also cited seven prior patents related to the Java technology created by Sun and now owned by Oracle that Google should have been aware of as they had hired former Sun developers that worked on Java. Oracle sought both monetary damages and an injunction to stop Google from using the allegedly infringing materials. The case was assigned to Judge William Alsup, who split the case into three phases: copyright, patent, and damages. The copyright phase started on April 16, 2012, and consisted of several distinct claims of infringement: a nine-line rangeCheck function, several test files, the structure, sequence and organization (SSO) of the Java (API), and the API documentation. Oracle alleged infringement of 37 separate Java APIs which had derived from the Apache Harmony project. After two weeks of testimony, the jury found on May 7, 2012, that Google had infringed on the copyright related to the code, SSO, and documentation of the APIs as well as the rangeCheck function, but were deadlocked on whether these uses fell within fair use. The jury also found that Google had sufficient reason to believe based on Sun's and Oracle's conduct that they did not need to license Java from Sun or Oracle, but did not rely on this when developing Android. Oracle requested a judgement as a matter of law (JMOL) that the case dismiss any fair use defense since the jury was split, as well as to overturn the jury's decision on eight security-related files that they had reviewed and found non-infringing but which Google had stated they copied verbatim; Alsup concurred. Google asked for a similar JMOL related to rangeCheck, but Alsup denied this request. The patent phase began on May 7, 2012, with the same jury. By the time of trial, Oracle's patent case comprised claims from two patents, 6,061,520 (Method and system for performing static initialization), and RE38104 (Method and apparatus for resolving data references in generated code)., Gosling, James, \\"Method and apparatus for resolving data references in generated code\\", issued 2003-04-29, assigned to Sun Microsystems and Oracle Google pursued a non-infringement defense. For the 6061520 patent, they argued that they were using parsing for optimizing static initialization, rather than \\"simulating execution\\" as the claim required. For the RE38104 patent, they argued that the instruction did not include a symbolic reference. On May 23, 2012, the jury found non-infringement on all patent claims. Judge Alsup issued the final verdict for both these phases on May 31, 2012. While the jury had found for Oracle regarding copyright infringement of the APIs, Alsup determined that the APIs were not copyrightable in the first place: > \\"So long as the specific code used to implement a method is different, > anyone is free under the Copyright Act to write his or her own code to carry > out exactly the same function or specification of any methods used in the > Java API. It does not matter that the declaration or method header lines are > identical.\\" Alsup did agree with the jury that the rangeCheck function and eight security files were a copyright infringement, but would only be found for statutory damages up to a maximum of As a result of these rulings and a stipulation, there was no jury damages phase. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for the small amount of copied code by June 2012.  First appellate ruling  Shortly following the conclusion of the District Court case, both parties attempted to file additional JMOLs on elements of the ruling which Alsup dismissed, leading to Oracle appealing the decision and Google filing a cross-appeal on the literal copying claim. Because the case involved claims related to patents, the appeal was automatically assigned to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The hearing was held on December 4, 2013, and the judgment was released on May 9, 2014. The court noted that Copyright Act provides protection to \\"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\\" (p. 17). The legislative history explains that literary works include \\"computer programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer's expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves\\" (p. 18). To qualify for copyright protection a work must be original. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 102(a). The court was therefore \\"first to assess whether the expression is original to the programmer\\" (p. 24), something that Google had already conceded (p. 21). This led the court to conclude \\"that the overall structure of Oracle's API packages is creative, original, and resembles a taxonomy\\" (p. 14). It therefore reversed the first instance's decision on the central issue, holding that the \\"structure, sequence and organization\\" of an API is copyrightable. It also ruled for Oracle regarding the small amount of literal copying, holding that it was not de minimis. The case was remanded to the District Court for a second trial, to consider whether Google's use was acceptable anyway, under the doctrine of fair use, since the original case had not brought out the facts related to fair use sufficiently for the Appeal Court to rule on that point.  Supreme Court petition  In October 2014, Google petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Oracle responded to the petition in December. Following a discussion of the petition at the Court's January 9 conference,Google, Inc. v. Oracle America, Inc., U.S. Supreme Court case no. 14-410, docketed October 8, 2014 (docket). the Court issued a Call for the Views of the Solicitor General, asking for the U.S. Solicitor General's input on whether the petition should be granted. On May 26, 2015, the U.S. Solicitor General recommended that the petition should be denied, expressing agreement with the appeals court ruling. The Court denied the certiorari petition on June 29, 2015.135 S. Ct. 2887 (2015),  Second phase: fair use  The second phase of the case has been in progress since 2016. Given that APIs are copyrightable, Oracle successfully established that a commercial reimplementation of an API is not fair use. However, this ruling is currently pending review by the Supreme Court.  Second District Court trial  As ordered by the Appeals Court, a new district court trial began on May 9, 2016, on the question of whether Google's actions were fair use. Closing arguments were completed on May 23, 2016 and the jury of eight women and two men began deliberations. Oracle was seeking damages of up to US$9 billion. On May 26, 2016, the jury found that Android does not infringe Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs was protected by fair use. Oracle announced its intention to appeal, but before doing so, it attempted unsuccessful motions to disregard the jury verdict, and then to hold a re- trial. Oracle officially filed its appeal on October 26, 2016.  Second appellate ruling  Oracle's appeal was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2017. On March 27, 2018, the Court ruled in favor of Oracle. The ruling analyzed the aspects of a \\"fair use\\" claim which were to be decided by a judge and jury, respectively. It then looked at the factual matters which, it had to be assumed, the jury had reached, and their implications in law. It noted that in a \\"mixed\\" case of fact and law, such as the present dispute, the trial jury's role is to decide on the facts. Judge Alsup quoted the Supreme Court case Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc. in his opinion, noting that: > \\"truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if > any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original > throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must > necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before\\" The Appeal Court's role is to assess whether a reasonable jury could have reached the conclusions it did, and whether the judge's decision could be correct and reasonable in law. The standard review of mixed questions of law and fact concerned three components: \\"(1) determining the legal standard governing the question posed and what types of historical facts are relevant to that standard; (2) finding what the historical facts in the case at hand are; and (3) assessing whether the historical facts found satisfy the legal test governing the question to be answered\\" (Decision p. 19). Except clear error, the role of the jury is limited to determining disputed 'historical facts' (2). The facts are not discussed. \\"It is undisputed that Google copied verbatim the declaring code of the 37 Java API packages 11,500 lines of Oracle‚Äôs copyrighted code. It also copied the SSO of the Java API packages. (Decision p.10)\\" It is also established and Google recognizes that the software copied is creative and original. The Court found that as a matter of law, Google's use of Java could not have fallen within fair use, even if all factual matters decided by the jury had been in Google's favor. The Appeals Court found that Google's use of API code declarations had not met any of the four current criteria for fair use, but was merely untransformed reuse. It had not been transformative, since it was used for the same purposes without even minimal changes or rewrites. It was not minimal, since it was agreed that only 170 lines of the 11,500 lines copied were needed for Google's purposes. It was not within any example of transformation, nor intended to permit third party interoperability, since Google had made no substantial efforts to use them for the purpose of third party interoperability. (In fact it found that Google had tried to prevent interoperability with other Java and had previously been refused a license by Sun for that reason.) It was not transformative in the sense of a new platform either, since other Java smartphones predated Android. It was plausible that the use had harmed Sun/Oracle ‚Äì perhaps to a great extent if Oracle were to be believed ‚Äì since as a result, vendors began to expecting Oracle to compete on price with a freely available derivative of its own language, and to require very steep discounts and undesired contractual terms. Therefore, Google's use of the Java code and APIs failed to meet all four of the currently accepted criteria under which fair use would be possible. Instead, the Court found that Google's purpose had been to enhance its nascent Android platform's attractiveness to existing developers, who were often familiar with Java, and to avoid the \\"drudgery\\" of rewriting the code (which they could have done) needed to implement the 170 lines of API detail which were indeed required. \\"Making it easy for oneself\\", the court noted, is well established to not fall within valid grounds for fair use. The Court found that \\"The fact that Android is free of charge does not make Google's use of the Java API packages noncommercial\\". Oracle > \\"devised a licensing scheme to attract programmers while simultaneously > commercializing the platform. In relevant part, Oracle charges a licensing > fee to those who want to use the APIs in a competing platform or embed them > in an electronic device. To preserve the 'write once, run anywhere' > philosophy, Oracle imposes strict compatibility requirements on > licensees\\".(p.9 2017-118, 207-102) The purpose was commercial, and was not fair use, and the Court remanded the case back to the District Court of the Northern District of California to determine the amount of damage that Google should pay Oracle.  Supreme Court  Google filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the appeals court in Oracle's favor. In its petition, Google centered its case on whether copyright extends to a software interface like an API, and whether the use of the Java API by Google fell within fair use as found at the jury trials. In orders issued in April 2019, the Court asked the Solicitor General of the United States to file an amicus brief to outline the government's stance on the case. The Trump administration backed Oracle and urged the Court to deny certiorari. Microsoft, Mozilla Corporation, Red Hat Inc., and others filed amicus briefs in support of Google's position. IBM, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the Internet Association, the Auto Care Association, and a collective group of over 150 academics and computer professionals also filed briefs supporting Google's stance, cautioning that a decision in favor of Oracle would hurt the computing world as a whole. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on November 15, 2019, and was expected to hear the case on March 24, 2020. However, the Supreme Court postponed its March argument session on March 16 in light of concerns surrounding COVID-19, and later announced that Google v. Oracle was one of several cases from the 2019‚Äì20 term to be postponed until the first week of the 2020‚Äì21 term. Following the delay, the Court asked parties to submit additional briefs related to Seventh Amendment question raised by Google, given that the Federal District court had overridden some of the findings of facts that the jury had concluded in their case at the District level. Oral arguments were heard via teleconference due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on October 7, 2020. Court observers found that while the Justices seemed to side with Oracle on the copyright arguments, they also took deference to the arguments presented by Microsoft, who had taken Google's side on the case. Microsoft argued in an amicus brief that ruling in Oracle's favor could upend the software industry. Several questions focused on how APIs fell within the idea‚Äìexpression distinction of copyright and if the merger doctrine would apply. Justice Gorsuch was also seen to focus heavily on the Seventh Amendment arguments and whether the Federal District's ruling was proper. Impact Google v. Oracle has been a closely watched case by the tech industry, as a ruling favoring Oracle could have significant effects on past and future software development, given the prolific use of APIs. Opponents of the federal court's ruling, including Google and other developers of Android-based software, have raised several concerns including the impact on interoperability, software innovation and the potential for bad actors to pick up the rights to old software and file claims against companies who built their software under what were assumed were open standards. If this ruling is allowed to stand, it is believed that companies will be forced to implement deliberately incompatible standards to protect themselves from the risk of complex litigation, moving away from the current trends in software development which have focused on improving interoperability between different services allowing apps to communicate with one another, creating more integrated platforms for end users. Industry and legal experts had stated an Oracle victory could create a chilling effect in software development, with copyright holders using the copyright on APIs to prevent their use in developing interoperable alternatives through reverse engineering, as common in open source software development. At the same time, a judgement favoring Google's position may weaken protection for copyright for software code developers, allowing competitors with better resources to develop improved products from smaller firms, and reduce the motive for innovation within the industry.

His personal name was Ti√°n Y«én (Áî∞Ââ°), and ancestral name Gui (Â™Ø). Reign Yan's father was Duke Tai of Tian Qi, the first Qi ruler from the House of Tian. Although leaders of the Tian clan had been de facto rulers of Qi since 481 BC, it wasn't until 386 BC that Duke Tai was formally recognized as ruler of Qi by King An of Zhou, the nominal king of all China. Duke Tai ascended the throne and exiled Duke Kang of Qi, the last Qi ruler from the House of Jiang, to a seaside city. Duke Tai died two years later and was succeeded by Yan. Duke Kang died in 379 BC. In 378 BC the states of Han, Zhao, and Wei invaded Qi and attacked the city of Lingqiu (in present-day Gaotang County, Shandong Province). In 375 BC Yan was murdered by his younger brother Tian Wu, who usurped the throne and became known as Duke Huan of Tian Qi. Yan's son Tian Xi was also killed.Annals of Wei, Bamboo Annals (in Chinese). Historical records Because of the lack of reliable records during the Warring States period, the chapter on the House of Tian in Sima Qian's influential Shiji is unreliable and error-prone. Yan's reign was completely omitted from the Shiji, and he remained largely unknown until the discovery of the Bamboo Annals in 281 AD during the Jin dynasty. Mausoleum Yan's mausoleum is located on the Dingzu Mountain (ÈºéË∂≥Â±±) near Qiling Town, in Linzi District of Zibo, Shandong, near the ancient Qi capital Linzi. There are two hill-like tombs built on the same platform. Together they measure from north to south, from east to west, and high. The area is called Two Kings' Cemetery (‰∫åÁéãÂÜ¢), and had been for 2,000 years thought to be the tombs of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Jing of Qi. However, archaeologists have concluded that they are in fact the tombs of Yan and his brother and murderer, Duke Huan of Tian Qi. All seven known mausoleums of Tian Qi rulers are now protected as a National Historical and Cultural Site. Since 2008 they have been included in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of the ancient Qi capital and mausoleum complex.

In Japan, adult adoption may be used in order to facilitate the continuance of a family business. This form of adoption is known as mukoy≈çshi (\\"son-in-law adoption\\"). Adult adoption may also be used in some jurisdictions by same-sex couples in order to establish inheritance rights. Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction, adult adoption may not be available as a legal option. In the United Kingdom, only children may be adopted. The Adoption and Children Act (2002) states, \\"An application for an adoption order may only be made if the person to be adopted has not attained the age of 18 years on the date of the application.\\" In places where adult adoptions exist, it may or may not transfer filiation in addition to inheritance rights. For example, in Colorado, one can adopt an adult of age 21 or older for inheritance purposes, but filiation will remain unaffected. However, adoption of a person between the ages of 18 and 20 (inclusive) transfers both inheritance rights and filiation. In countries where same-sex couples have not received the same legal protections as heterosexual couples, adult adoption of a partner has been used to insure the property transfer to the surviving partner upon death.

Within the 1970s, Bishop was a DJ on the north Norfolk circuit, and later in East London. He has been involved in starting up a number of businesses for arts and regeneration projects within the Lea Valley, and the North-West, including Artzone, and the Claverings company LTD. Currently, Piers is a practising artist, focussing mainly in painting and digital works, based on scientific themes. He lives in Morecambe, Lancashire, following leaving the Claverings company in 2002. Life and work=Early years Throughout his childhood years, Piers was a product model for a number of different companies including Savlon, and Wall's ice cream. He was also a catalogue model, and was often the face of knitting patterns. Piers progressed from modelling to acting, and his first film was the 1962 thriller Tomorrow at Ten. This was followed up in 1964 by Ballad in Blue, starring alongside Ray Charles. After these, he was selected to star in Antony and Cleopatra, however due to legal reasons he had to decline the role. Piers' acting career came to an end when his parent's business was relocated from London to Norfolk. After leaving school, Piers became a DJ in the local area. He then moved back to London, and continued his DJing, alongside his career in sales management and IT. This eventually became too time consuming, and so he gave up the DJing. He continued this career path until 1993. Artistry In 1994 Piers achieved his Art and Design A Level at Enfield College, and went on to study a Foundation in Art and Design, at St. Albans college of Art. He completed this in 1996.

He is known for experimenting with the Malay language in the writing of his drama Bebasari and his poetry collection poetry anthology Pertjikan Permenoengan. Biography Effendi was born in Padang, West Sumatra, Dutch East Indies, on 13 May 1903. After elementary school, he studied at schools for teachers in Bukittinggi and Bandung, West Java. In 1924 he returned to Padang to be a teacher. Effendi published his first stage drama, Bebasari, in the mid-1920s; it was a critique of Dutch colonialism based on the Ramayana. The work is considered the first stage drama in modern Indonesian literature. However, its distribution was hampered by the Dutch, who cited Effendi's communist leanings. He also released the poetry anthology Pertjikan Permenoengan (Stains of Self-Reflection), among these poems were works that were indirectly anti-colonial, such as the poem \\"Tanah Air\\" (\\"Homeland\\"). However, after a failed Communist revolt that year, Effendi's works could no longer be published because of the tighter censorship. As such, he felt forced to leave the country. From 1928 to 1947 Effendi lived in the Netherlands. From 1933 to 1946 he was a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands and served in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, promoting native rights for the Dutch East Indies. He also wrote a work in Dutch, entitled Van Moskow naar Tiflis. Effendi died in Jakarta on 24 May 1979. He was the older brother of Bachtiar Effendi, an Indonesian film actor and director. Themes and styles Effendi dealt with several themes in his works. Among the most prominent, especially in Bebasari, was anti-colonialism, with veiled criticism of the Dutch East Indies government. Other themes included love, both romantic and familial, as in the poems \\"Kenangan Lama\\" (\\"Old Memories\\") and \\"Kuburan Bunda\\" (\\"Mother's Grave\\"), and the beauty of nature, as in \\"Lautan\\" (\\"Sea\\") and \\"Bulan\\" (\\"Moon\\"). Effendi's language, although it reflected the patterns of Old Malay, was experimental. The writer borrowed from foreign languages, especially Sanskrit and Arabic. He occasionally changed words, including adding and subtracting letters, to suit his intended rhythm and tempo, such as by using \\"menung\\" instead of \\"\\" to say \\"wait\\". Compared to contemporary poet Muhammad Yamin, Effendi had stronger imagery. Reception The socialist literary scholar Bakri Siregar wrote that Effendi drew the anti-colonial struggle well, with evocative imagery, in Bebasari. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw wrote that Effendi, as a poet, was \\"amazing, especially because of his language which had no equal\\" and efforts to break away from the traditional syair. However, Teeuw opined that Effendi did not play a large role in the further development of Indonesian literature; he found Sanusi Pane as the most influential poet of the time.

Wright and starring Gene Autry, Smiley Burnette, and Lois Wilde. Based on a story by Tom Gibson, the film is about a cowboy who decides to sing on television in order to raise money for the orphaned daughter of his former boss who was murdered. Plot Ranch owner Steve Stevens (John Van Pelt) is shot by his greedy partner, Martin (Lon Chaney, Jr.), who then sets fire to Stevens' barn. Stevens' last request is for cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) to look after his daughter, Lou Ann (Ann Gillis), who was trampled by a horse during the barn fire and paralyzed. Martin befriends Lou Ann, hoping to gain possession of the secret gold mine beneath the Stevens' ranch. Lou Ann does not suspect Martin in her father's murder. Needing to raise $10,000 for Lou Ann's spinal surgery, Gene confidently wrangles his way into a promotional job with Covered Wagon Coffee Company and travels in a caravan equipped with television equipment, broadcasting a Covered Wagon Coffee show to small towns in the West. In his home town of Plainesville, Gene organizes an amateur singing contest. Helen Blake (Lois Wilde), the daughter of his boss Henry Blake (Harvey Clark), auditions without her father's permission and without Gene knowing her real identity. Concerned about his daughter, Henry Blake sends Helen's fianc√©e, Herbert Trenton (Earl Eby), after her. With the date of Lou Ann's surgery quickly approaching, Gene receives a bank advance on his radio contract to cover the cost. Martin steals Gene's wagon, unaware that Helen is hiding inside. This fouls Gene's bank advance and it is cancelled. Helen secretly sends an \\"S.O.S.\\" signal using the equipment in the stolen wagon, and Gene is able to find the wagon and free her. Martin's gang follows Gene and Helen into town where they are arrested. Gene collects the reward money offered by Trenton for Helen's safe return, getting enough money to cover Lou Ann's surgery. Thinking that Gene is interested only in her money, Helen goes back to Trenton. Gene eventually captures Martin, and after his men reveal his guilt in connection with the secret gold mine, he is also arrested. After performing in the recovered coffee caravan, Gene rushes to the Plainesville courthouse and saves Helen from marrying Trenton.

The French explorer Samuel de Champlain, when writing about Basque whaling in Terranova (i.e. Newfoundland), described them as \\"the cleverest men at this fishing\\".Martijn, C.J., S. Barkham, and M.M. Barkham. 2003. Basques? Beothuk? Innu? Inuit? or St. Lawrence Iroquoians? The Whalers on the 1546 Desceliers Map, Seen Through the Eyes of Different Beholders. Newfoundland and Labrador Studies, Vol. 19, No. 1: The New Early Modern Newfoundland: Part 2. By the early 17th century, other nations entered the trade in earnest, seeking the Basques as tutors, \\"for [they] were then the only people who understand whaling\\", lamented the English explorer Jonas Poole. Having learned the trade themselves, other nations adopted their techniques and soon dominated the burgeoning industry ‚Äì often to the exclusion of their former instructors. Basque whaling peaked in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, but was in decline by the late 17th and early 18th centuries. By the 19th century, it was moribund as the right whale was nearly extinct and the bowhead whale was decimated. Bay of Biscay right Beginnings There is a document, a bill, which states in the year 670 a delivery of 40 \\"moyos\\" (casks of 250 liters) of \\"aceite de ballena\\" (whale oil) or \\"grasa de ballena\\" (whale blubber) was made from Bayonne to the abbey of Jumi√®ges, between Le Havre and Rouen, for its use in illumination. The authors that assessed this document suggest for such a request to be made by such a distant monastery that Basque whaling must have been well known ‚Äì although the oil or blubber easily could have come from a stranded whale whose products were usurped by the church.Urzainqui, T. and J. M. de Olaizola (1998). La Navarra Maritima. Pamiela. Establishment and expansion The distinctive V-shaped blow of a North Atlantic right whale, the primary species hunted by the Basques in the Bay of Biscay Another author contends that the first mention of the use of whales by the Basques came in 1059, in which year a measure was passed to concentrate whale meat in the market of Bayonne.Aguilar, A. 1986. A Review of Old Basque Whaling and its Effect on the Right Whales (Eubalaena glacialis) of the North Atlantic. Reports of the International Whaling Commission (special issue) 10: 191-199. By the year 1150 whaling had spread to the Basque provinces of Spain. In this year King Sancho the Wise of Navarre (r. 1150‚Äì94) granted San Sebasti√°n certain privileges. The grant lists various goods that must be paid duties for warehousing, and among this list \\"boquinas-barbas de ballenas\\" or plates of whalebone (baleen) held a prominent place. By 1190, whaling had spread to Santander. In 1203, Alfonso VIII of Castile gave Hondarribia the same privileges that had been given to San Sebastian. In 1204, these privileges were extended to Mutriku and Getaria. Similar privileges were given to Zarautz by Ferdinand III of Castile in a royal order dated at Burgos 28 September 1237. This document also states that \\"in accordance with custom, the King should have a slice of each whale, along the backbone, from the head to the tail\\". Whaling also spread to Asturias (1232) and finally to Galicia (1371). Up to 49 ports had whaling establishments along the coast from the French Basque country to Cape Finisterre. The principal target of the trade was what the French Basques called \\"sarde\\". It was later called the Biscayan right whale (Balaena biscayensis), and is now known as the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). It was caught during its migration from the months of October‚ÄìNovember to February‚ÄìMarch, with peak catching probably occurring in January. They may have also hunted the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), which existed in the North Atlantic until at least the early 18th century. Bryant suggests that if gray whales inhabited coastal waters like they do today in the North Pacific they would have been likely targets for Basque whalers, perhaps even more so then the North Atlantic right whale ‚Äì although most contemporary illustrations and skeletal remains from catches were of the latter species. They may have also caught the occasional sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), as remains of this species were found in the old buildings used to try out the blubber into oil. Hunting methods The whales were spotted by full-time look-outs from stone watchtowers (known as vig√≠as) situated on headlands or high up on mountains overlooking the harbor, which limited the hunting area to several miles around the port. The remains of these vig√≠as reportedly exist on Talaya mendi (\\"Look-out mountain\\") above Zarautz and on Whale Hill in Ulia, San Sebastian, while the point on which the vig√≠a in Biarritz was once situated is now the site of a lighthouse, the Pointe Saint-Martin Light (est. 1834).Jenkins, J. T. 1921. A History of the Whale Fisheries. Reissued 1971, Kennikat Press.Jones, R. 2007. The Lighthouse Encyclopedia: The Definitive Reference. Globe Pequot Pr. When the spout of a whale was sighted, the watchman alerted the men by burning some straw, beating a drum, ringing a bell or waving a flag. Once alerted, men launched small rowing boats from the beach, or, if the shoreline was steep, the boats were held by a capstan and launched by releasing the rope attached to the boats. The whale was struck with a two-flued harpoon (as shown in the seal of Hondarribia, dated 1297), lanced, and killed. A larger boat manned by ten men towed the carcass ashore, waiting for high tide to beach the whale, where it was flensed. The blubber was then brought to a boiling house where it was rendered into oil.Francis, D. 1990. A History of World Whaling. Viking. Tithes and taxes According to the Laws of Ol√©ron the whalemen of Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and the rest of the French Basque country were exempt from taxation, although they voluntarily gave the whales' tongues to the church as a gift. It wasn't until the kings of England, acting as the Dukes of Guyenne, that charges began to be enacted against them. In 1197, the future King John of England (r. 1199‚Äì1216)Saul, N. 1997. The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England. Oxford University Press. gave Vital de Biole and his heirs and successors the right to levy a tax of 50 angevin livres on the first two whales taken annually at Biarritz, in exchange for the rent of the fishery at Guernsey. In 1257, William Lavielle gave the bishop and chapter of Bayonne a tithe of the whales caught by the men of the same port. This was paid until 1498. In 1261, an act of the Abbey of Honce announced, as a continuation of the tradition of giving the tongue as a gift to the church, a tithe was to be paid on the whales landed at Bayonne. Under a 1324 edict known as De Praerogativa Regis (The Royal Prerogative), Edward II (r. 1307‚Äì27) collected a duty on the whales caught in British waters, which included the French Basque coast.Ellis, R. 1991. Men & Whales. Alfred A. Knopf. His successor, Edward III (r. 1327‚Äì77), continued this tradition by collecting a ¬£6 tax for each whale taken and landed at Biarritz. In 1338, this was relinquished to Peter de Puyanne, admiral of the English fleet stationed at Bayonne.Scoresby, W. 1820. An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and a Description of the Northern Whale-Fishery. Edinburgh. In Lekeitio, the first document to mention the use of whales in its archives, dated 11 September 1381, states that the whalebone procured in that port would be divided into three parts, with \\"two for repairing the boat-harbour, and the third for the fabric of the church.\\" A document of 1608 repeats this order. A similar order, dated 20 November 1474, said that half the value of each whale caught from Getaria should be given towards the repair of the church and boat-harbor. It was also custom in Getaria to give the first whale of the season to the King, half of which he returned. San Sebasti√°n, in continuing an ancient custom, gave the whalebone to the Cofradia (brotherhood) of San Pedro. Cultural significance The trade had reached such importance in the Basque provinces during this time that several towns and villages depicted whales or whaling scenes on their seals and coat-of-arms. This practice included Bermeo (dated 1351), Castro Urdiales (currently outside the Basque region), Hondarribia (1297), Getaria, Lekeitio, Mutriku (1507, 1562), and Ondarroa in Spain; and Biarritz, Gu√©thary, and Hendaye in France. Whaling was important enough that laws were passed in 1521 and 1530, barring foreign (re. French) whalers from operating off the Spanish coast, while in 1619 and 1649, foreign whale products could not be sold in Spanish markets. Peak and decline The industry in the French Basque region never reached the importance it did in the Spanish provinces. Few towns participated and only a small number of whales were probably taken. From the number of extant documents and written references Aguilar (1986) surmised that French Basque whaling peaked in the second half of the 13th century, and subsequently declined. Although whaling as a commercial activity had ended by 1567, some right whales were taken as late as 1688.Reeves, R.R., T.D. Smith and E.A. Josephson. 2007. Near- Annihilation of a Species: Right Whaling in the North Atlantic. pp. 39‚Äì74. In S. D. Kraus and R. Rolland. The Urban Whale: North Atlantic Right Whales at the Crossroads. Harvard University Press. For the Spanish Basque region (Biscay and Gipuzkoa) the peak was reached in the second half of the 16th century, but as early as the end of the same century it was in decline. Subsequently, an increase in whaling activity appears to have occurred in Cantabria, Asturias, and Galicia in the first half of the 17th century. Here the Basques hired seasonal \\"land factories\\" (whaling stations), particularly in Galicia ‚Äì the Galicians themselves were never whalers but only built these installations so they could rent them out on an annual basis to the Basques. The peak was short-lived. By the second half of the 17th century whaling in these areas was in general decline. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14) sounded the death knell for whaling in the Bay of Biscay, with the trade ceasing altogether in Cantabria (1720), Asturias (1722), and Galicia (1720). It only continued in the Spanish Basque region, where it barely survived. Catch The total number of right whales taken by the Basques in the Bay of Biscay is unknown, as serial catch statistics weren't compiled until the 16th century. Incomplete catch statistics for Lekeitio from 1517 to 1662 show a total catch of 68 whales, an average of two-and-a-half a year. The most were caught in 1536 and 1538, when six were taken in each year. In 1543, whalemen from Lekeitio injured a whale, but it was captured by the men of Mutriku, resulting in the whale being divided between the two towns. The same year a mother-calf pair were caught. On 24 February 1546, a whale was reportedly killed in front of St. Nicholas Island. In 1611, two small whales were killed by the men of Lekeitio and Ondarroa, which resulted in a lawsuit. Similar records exist for Zarautz and Getaria. Fifty-five whales were caught from Zarautz between 1637 and 1801, and eighteen from Getaria between 1699 and 1789. Although whaling in the Basque regions was carried out as a cooperative enterprise among all the fishermen of a town, only the watchmen received a salary while there was no whaling. With such a low economic investment, \\"profits from a single whale would have been enormous, since their value was very high in those days.\\" In such circumstances a catch of one whale every two or three years for each port may have kept the trade alive. Coming to a conclusion on the number of whales caught along the entire coast in a single year, as Aguilar has noted, is a more difficult matter. Even though 49 ports have been identified as whaling settlements, they didn't all participate in the trade at the same time, as it is known that some ports only hunted whales for a short period of time. Also, no details exist of the operations of small galleons that caught whales in the Bay of Biscay ‚Äì especially off Galicia ‚Äì without a station ashore. Aguilar suggests the total yearly catch may not have exceeded \\"some dozens, possibly reaching one hundred or thereabouts.\\" Composition of catch and possible reasons for decline Despite the seemingly low annual harvest, two factors must be taken into consideration when discussing the decline and later (nearly) complete disappearance of right whales in the region: one, the preference of Basque whalers to target mother- calf pairs; and two, exploitation of the species outside the Bay of Biscay. The Basque whalemen directed most of their attention to attacking calves, given they were easily captured and, when struck, allowed them to approach the mother, who came to its aid, only to be killed herself. To encourage such methods, the harpooner and crew that wounded the calf first was rewarded a greater share of the profits. Of the 86 whales caught from Getaria and Lekeitio, up to 22% were calves. Such hunting methods would have had \\"detrimental consequences\\" for the species. The second factor may have been even more devastating to right whales, given the stock identify of this species is unknown. There may have been a large population extending throughout the North Atlantic, meaning a single population would have been taken in several areas at the same time, as this species was the main target of operations in New England, New York, Iceland, Northern Norway,Smith, T. D., K. Barthelmess and R. R. Reeves. 2006. Using Historical Records to Relocate a Long-forgotten Summer Feeding Ground of North Atlantic Right Whales. Mar. Mam. Sci., 22 (3); 723-734. and elsewhere from the early 17th century onwards. It was once thought that this species was also the main target (or at least represented half the catch) in southern Labrador, but it now appears as though bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) were the primary targets. If a small, discrete stock had existed in the Bay of Biscay, then localized hunting by the Basques may have led to its over-exploitation and subsequent (near) disappearance there. A third possibility, perhaps the most plausible, would be that there are (or were) two populations, one in the western North Atlantic and the other in the eastern North Atlantic. Such a view would conform well with the mainly coastal distribution of right whales in the western North Atlantic today. Still, this possibility would result in the harvest of right whales not only in the Bay of Biscay, but in Iceland, Northern Norway, and the rest of Europe, which may have been enough to severely deplete this supposed stock. Decay The last whale killed in Orio Skull of the Orio whale Only four whales were reportedly caught in the Bay of Biscay in the 19th century, and at least one more was struck but lost and another chased unsuccessfully. The first was caught off Hondarribia in 1805, the second off San Sebastian in 1854, the third off Getaria-Zarautz in 1878, and the last off San Sebastian in 1893. In January 1854, three whales (said to be a mother and her two calves) entered the bay of San Sebastian. Only one of the calves was caught. The whale caught off Getaria-Zarautz was taken on 11 February. Several boats were sent out of both ports, along with one from Orio. The whale was struck with a harpoon from Getaria, but the line belonged to Zarautz. This resulted in a lawsuit, which led to the whale being left to rot ashore. The unpleasant smell of the decomposing carcass led to it being blown up. In 1844, a whale was struck off Zarautz, but, after being towed for six hours, the line was broken, and the whale was lost with two harpoons and three lances in its body. Another whale was seen off Getaria early in the morning on 25 July 1850, but the harpooner missed his mark, and the whale swam away to the northwest. On 14 May 1901, a 12 m (39 ft) right whale was killed by fishermen using dynamite off the town of Orio, an event reflected in a folk poem popularized by singer- songwriter Benito Lertxundi. A local festival representing this catch have been held on 5 year intervals.Basque Coast - Turismo Euskadi Only a few more sightings of right whales were made in the area, the last in 1977, when the crew of a Spanish whale catcher sighted one at about 43¬∞ N and 10¬∞ 30' W. Newfoundland and Labrador=Early claims Basque settlements and sites dating from the 16th and 17th centuries Around 1525 Basques began whaling and fishing for cod off Newfoundland, Labrador, and similar places.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/basques In his History of Brittany (1582), the French jurist and historian Bertrand d'Argentr√© made the claim that the Basques, Bretons, and Normans were the first to reach the New World \\"before any other people\\".Knight, C. 1866. The English Cyclopaedia. London: Bradbury, Evans. The Bordeaux jurist Etienne de Cleirac (1647) made a similar claim, stating that the French Basques, in pursuing whales across the North Atlantic, discovered North America a century before Columbus. The Belgian cetologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden (1878, 1892) repeated such assertions by saying that the Basques, in the year 1372, found the number of whales to increase on approach of the Newfoundland Banks. Beginnings and expansion The first undisputed presence of Basque whaling expeditions in the New World was in the second quarter of the 16th century. It appears to have been the French Basques, following the lead of Breton cod- fishermen that reported finding rich whaling grounds in Terranova (Newfoundland). The Basques called the area they frequented Grandbaya (Grand Bay), today known as the Strait of Belle Isle, which separates Newfoundland from southern Labrador. Their initial voyages to this area were mixed cod and whaling ventures. Instead of returning home with whale oil, they brought back whale meat in brine. The French Basque ship La Catherine d'Urtubie made the first known voyage involving whale products in 1530, when she supposedly returned with 4,500 dried and cured cod, as well as twelve barrels of whale meat \\"without flippers or tail\\" (a phrase for whale meat in brine). After a period of development, expeditions were sent purely aimed at obtaining whale oil. The first establishments for processing whale oil in southern Labrador may have been built in the late 1530s, although it wasn't until 1548 that notarial documents confirm this. By the 1540s, when the Spanish Basques began sending whaling expeditions to Newfoundland, the ventures were no longer experimental, but a \\"resounding financial success from their inception.\\" By the end of the decade they were delivering large cargoes of whale oil to Bristol, London, and Flanders. A large market existed for \\"lumera\\", as whale oil used for lighting was called. \\"Sain\\" or \\"grasa de ballena\\" was also used (by mixing it with tar and oakum) for caulking ships, as well as in the textile industry. Ambroise Par√© (1510‚Äì90), who visited Bayonne when King Charles IX (r. 1560‚Äì74) was there in 1564, said they used the baleen to \\"make farthingales, stays for women, knife-handles, and many other things\\".Paget, S. 1897. Ambroise Par√© and His Times, 1510-1590. New York, Putnam. Most documents dealing with whaling in Newfoundland concern the years 1548 to 1588, with the largest quantity dealing with the harbor of Red Bay or \\"Less Buttes\\"‚Å†‚Äîboth names in reference to the red granite cliffs of the region. The references include acts of piracy in the 1550s, the loss of a ship in 1565, a disastrous wintering in 1576‚Äì77, and, on Christmas Eve 1584, a will written for a dying Basque, Joanes de Echaniz; the first known Canadian will. The last overwintering in Red Bay was made in 1603. During their onshore stays, the whalers developed relations with North American natives that led to the establishment of a purpose-specific language with both American native and Basque elements. Wrecks In 1978, the wreck of a ship was found in Red Bay. She is believed to be the Spanish Basque galleon San Juan, a three- masted, 27.1 m (90 ft) long, 250‚Äì300-ton vessel that was lost in 1565. San Juan, carrying a cargo of nearly 1,000 barrels of whale oil, was wrecked by an autumn storm. She grounded stern first on the northern side of Saddle Island, struck the bottom several times and split her keel open before sinking 30 yards from shore.Grenier, R. 1985. Excavating a 400-year-old Basque galleon. National Geographic, Vol. 168, No. 1 (July 1985): 58-68. Her captain, Joanes de Portu, and crew were able to save the sails, rigging, some provisions, and about half the whale oil. The crew took to the boats and hailed another ship for a ride back to Spain. The following year de Portu salvaged more of the wreck before she finally sank out of sight. Three more wrecks have been found in Red Bay, the last in 2004.Anonymous. 2004. Another 16th-century galleon found at Red Bay Harbour. News Release (Tourism, Culture, and Recreation), Government of Newfoundland and Labrador-Canada, August 3. The charred hull fragments of the second ship, found in 1983, strongly suggest the ship sank because of a fire. Hunting methods, culture, and archaeology Site of one of the Basque whaling stations on Saddle Island. The location of the sunken galleon San Juan (1565) is near the wreck of Bernier (which grounded in 1966). Two species of whale were hunted in southern Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were taken during the \\"early\\" season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October‚ÄìJanuary). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s‚Äì1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600‚Äì700 tons, while the French Basques usually fitted out smaller vessels. A 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300‚Äì400 quintals of ship's biscuit, as well as other dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, mustard seed, and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless them and say a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. Halfway there the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors ‚Äì Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, Red Bay, Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador.Anonymous. 1985. Discovery in Labrador: A 16th-Century Basque Whaling Port and Its Sunken Fleet. National Geographic, Vol. 168, No. 1 (July 1985): 41-49. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.Barkham, S. H. 2003. Basque, Whales, and Ternua, History. In Ternua Philosophy. In these bays the men constructed temporary whaling stations to process the whale blubber into oil. The tryworks were built close to the shore facing the harbor. They consisted of up to seven or eight fireboxes usually made of local granite ‚Äì but on occasion containing imported sandstone or limestone ballast rock ‚Äì backed by a heavy stone wall and common side walls. More fireboxes were built than were used at once, as the local granite quickly deteriorated after exposure to a wood fire. It appears that once a firebox had lost its usefulness, the men merely shifted the trypot to a \\"spare\\" firebox to continue processing the oil. Behind the main wall were wooden platforms where men would ladle the oil from the trypots into vessels filled with cold water used to cool and purify the oil. The foundations of the tryworks were mortared with local or imported fine clay and sheltered by a roof of red ceramic tiles supported by heavily framed wooden posts dug into the ground. On a small terrace overlooking the tryworks was a substantial tile-roofed building, the cooperage. While the cooper lived comfortably in this structure other crew members used smaller structures framed with wood and covered with cloth and baleen as sleeping quarters. Dozens of these dwellings have been found among the bedrock outcrops on Saddle Island. Here hearths were built in small niches in the rock that sheltered the men from the wind. In 1982, archaeologists found a whaler's cemetery on the extreme eastern side of Saddle Island. Four subsequent summers of excavations revealed that it contained the remains of more than 60 graves, consisting of more than 140 individuals, all adult males in their early 20s to early 40s, with the exception of two twelve-year-olds. One burial contained the remains of a wool shirt and a pair of breeches ‚Äì the former of which having been dyed with madder and the latter with indigo. The breeches were of thick, heavily teaseled wool, gathered at the waist and cut full at the hips, tapered to a tight fit at the knees, certainly making their owners warm and comfortable in the coastal tundra environment they had to live and work in, where the highest temperature (reached in August) was only 50 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C). Another costume, recovered outside the cemetery, consisted of \\"a white knitted wool cap, an inner shirt and outer shirt or jacket made from white wool with a light brown plaid pattern, dark brown breeches, tailored stockings, and vegetable-tanned leather shoes.\\" Unlike the other pair of breeches, these were pleated at the waist and left open and baggy at the knees. At least sixteen stations have been found in Red Bay, eight on the northern side of the 3,000 m (3/5 mile) long Saddle Island at the entrance of the bay; seven on the mainland; and one on tiny Penney Island within the bay. During the peak of the trade nearly 1,000 men could be found working in and around Red Bay, while as many as eleven ships resorted to this harbor in 1575, alone. Three vig√≠as were built on Saddle Island, one on the western side of the island near or on the present site of a lighthouse, the second on the eastern side at the top of a hill over 30 m (100 ft) in elevation, and the third on its eastern shore. There was also one placed on a 10 m (33 ft) high hill on the smaller Twin Island to the east. When an 8 m (26 ft) long whale was sighted, whaleboats called chalupas (chaloupes in French, and later shallops in English) were sent out, each manned by a steersman, five oarsmen, and a harpooner. The whale was harpooned and forced to tow a wooden drogue or drag, which was used to tire it. Once exhausted, it was lanced and killed. If darkness fell upon the crews before they returned, those ashore would light signal fires at the vig√≠as to guide them back to the station. The whales were brought alongside a wharf or cutting stage, where they were flensed. The blubber was tried out, cooled, and poured into barricas ‚Äì casks of oak that held 55 gallons of oil. These barrels were towed out to the ship by a boat, where they were stored in the hold. When a full cargo had been obtained, either during the right whale season, or, more often during the later bowhead season, many of the larger ships sailed to Pasaia to discharge their cargoes; they also fitted out of the same port. Pasaia was preferred by both French and Spanish Basques because of its deep-water entrance and the excellent shelter it provided from Biscay storms. Peak and decline An intensive era of whaling began when peace was established after the Valois marriage (1572). An average of fifteen ships was sent to Terranova each year, with twenty being sent during the peak years. Aguilar (1986), referring to the number of both Spanish and French Basque ships, said twenty-thirty galleons would seem fairly accurate. Thomas Cano (1611) said more than 200 ships were sent to Terranova, although this is an obvious exaggeration. Ships from Red Bay alone sent 6,000‚Äì9,000 barrels of oil to Europe every year during the peak of exploitation, while a further 8,000 or 9,000 barrels was produced in St. Modeste, Chateau Bay, and other harbors. Each ship averaged 1,000 barrels a season, a cargo that rivaled the Spanish galleons bringing back treasure from the Caribbean for sheer monetary value. So, on average, a minimum of 15,000 barrels of oil would have been produced each year, which would have involved a catch of at least 300 whales, or twenty per ship. Whaling in the Basque fisheries (1720) By the 1580s, whaling was in decline, as ships returned to port half empty. This decade also coincided with the period when the king needed Spanish Basque ships for his armadas. The trade was particularly affected in 1586, 1587, and 1588, when Spanish Basque ships and sailors were detained in preparation for the 1588 armada against England. The threat of such detentions continued to undermine Spanish Basque whaling into the 1590s and early 1600s. Although whale stocks may have had a chance to increase in the 1590s and early 1600s with the diminution of the Spanish Basque fleet, it appears the French Basques may have taken up the slack of their counterparts of northeastern Spain. In April 1602, Saint-Jean-de-Luz alone sent seven ships to carry out whaling in Terranova. Other factors, such as attacks by hostile Inuit (which, according to parish records, resulted in at least three instances of fatalities between 1575 and 1618), piratical attacks by the English and Dutch, and the opening of the Spitsbergen fishery (see below) may have also played a part in the decline. By 1632, they were finding it safer to hunt for whales out of the establishments at \\"C√¥te-Nord\\", such as Mingan and Escoumins and even as far south as Tadoussac at the mouth of the Saguenay River. Despite this, Spanish Basque expeditions continued to be sent to Labrador, with voyages documented in 1622, 1624‚Äì27, 1629‚Äì30, 1632, and later. As late as 1681 the port of Pasaia alone sent twelve whaling galleons to Terranova. The end came in 1697, when the Basques (apparently only the Spanish Basques) were prevented from sending out whaling expeditions to Terranova, while the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) finally expelled them from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Later the French Basques still sent whaling expeditions to Terranova, often basing them at Louisbourg. Brazil and Iceland=Brazil and early European ventures As early as the 14th century, Basque whalemen may have made \\"seasonal trips\\" to southern Ireland and the English Channel ‚Äì where they undoubtedly targeted right whales. These regions became particularly well known to them by the 16th century. By the first decade of the 17th century, Basque whaling had reached Brazil, not on its own initiative, but on that of the colonial government. With imports of whale oil from the Basque region and Cape Verde not meeting the demands of the expanding colonial sugar industry, they saw a solution in the humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that inhabited their coastal waters. Lacking the technical know-how to hunt them, they sought help abroad. In 1602, two Basque whalers accompanied Diogo Botelho, the newly appointed governor general of Brazil, to the colonial capital of Bahia de Todos os Santos. It was their crews that introduced commercial whaling to colonial Brazil. Each year for nearly a decade Basque ships made runs from Biscay to Brazil, where the oil they produced supplied sugar mills (engenhos) with a dependable source of fuel for nocturnal grinding, as well as oil for lubricating machinery and caulking boats and ships. This ended in 1610, when one of the Basque captains tried to smuggle Brazilwood out of the country. He was discovered and imprisoned ‚Äì as were his men. The same year the crown declared whaling to be a royal monopoly. Iceland One author, repeating an oft-referenced claim, contends that twenty Basque whaleships were sighted by the western tip of Iceland off Grunderfjord (Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur) in 1412.Kurlansky, M. 1999. The Basque History of the World. Knopf Canada. This claim has been revealed to be false. The Icelandic historian Trausti Einarsson (1987) has discovered that this was a reference to twenty foreign ships fishing off Iceland, as the English and other nations were fishing for cod there by the early 15th century.Fagan, B. M. 2006. Fish on Friday: Feasting, Fasting, and the Discovery of the New World. Basic Books. The first mention of Basque whaling in Iceland comes from the early 17th century. Two Icelandic annals state that Basques whalers were active around the Westfjords (the northwestern peninsula of Iceland) in 1610. A third annal says three Basque ships were whaling from Strandir in 1608, while another source says that a Spanish Basque ship was whaling around Strandir in 1613 ‚Äì which would be consistent with an illustration on an early 18th-century map that says: \\"Anno 1613 by de Biscayers beseylt.\\" The ship was directed to a suitable harbor in Steingr√≠msfj√∂r√∞ur. In this harbor is where the ship presumably processed its catch of seventeen whales ‚Äì probably North Atlantic right whales.Edvardsson, R., and M. Rafnsson. 2006. Basque Whaling Around Iceland: Archaeological Investigation in Strakatangi, Steingrimsfjordur. Short-lived prosperity and subsequent abandonment It was probably this ship's excellent haul, as well as the barring of Basque ships from Spitsbergen by the English the same year (see below), that resulted in 26 Basque ships being sent to Iceland in 1614. Only ten reached Iceland, as the rest had been scattered or robbed by the English. Most of the Spanish Basque ships spent the summer in Steingr√≠msfj√∂r√∞ur, while a few of the French Basque were situated to the north. In 1615, there were reported to be sixteen ships by Strandir. Only four stayed the summer to hunt whales from Reykjafj√∂r√∞ur in Strandir, the rest having departed for Russia. In September, three of the ships (under the commands of Martinus de Billafranca, Pedro de Aguirre, and Stephan de Tellaria), while preparing to leave, were sunk by the combination of a sudden storm and drift ice off the coast of Reykjafj√∂r√∞ur. Of the 82 whalers that came ashore, thirteen were killed while spending the night at a seasonal fishing station. Another eighteen were killed at √çsafjar√∞ardj√∫p in a campaign brought forth by the local sheriff, Ari Magn√∫sson, to protect the livelihood of the inhabitants. No foreign whalers are mentioned whaling off Iceland nearly a decade after the massacre. This was the last documented massacre in Icelandic history and would be known in Iceland as The Slaying of the Spaniards. Basque whaling in Iceland continued until at least the early 18th century, but by the second half of the 17th century, Icelandic annals mentioned French and Dutch whalers more often they did the Spanish Basques. In 1675‚Äì76, 1680, and 1683 one or more ships from the French Basque ports of Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Ciboure hunted whales off Iceland. They resorted to Iceland during the latter part of the season after having finished whaling off the eastern coast of Greenland. The last time whalers were mentioned ashore was in 1712, when Spanish Basque ships attempted to trade in Grundarfj√∂r√∞ur but were stopped by a lawman. Foreign whalers are only mentioned sporadically in the annals for the rest of the century. During century and a half of Basque whaling, a basic language (a pidgin) known to have been in use in Iceland was developed in order to allow for communication between the Basque whalers and other traders from different nations of the north Atlantic. Spitsbergen and Northern Norway Gr√∏nfjorden, on the west coast of Spitsbergen, where the first Basque whaling expedition to Svalbard went in 1612 Spitsbergen and expulsion It was in the northeastern North Atlantic that the Basques witnessed the loss of their near monopoly on the trade beginning in the early 17th century. Their men were recruited for English (1611), Dutch (1613), northern French (1613), and Danish (1617) whaling expeditions to Spitsbergen, where they hunted the bowhead whale. The first was caught on 12 June 1611 (Old-Style) by one of the six Basque whalemen recruited from the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. When the merchants of San Sebastian learned of this new whaling ground they were eager to expand their operations to that distant corner of the Arctic. The next year, 1612, they dispatched a single ship under the command of Juan de Erauso and piloted by the Englishman Nicholas Woodcock, a former employee of the Muscovy Company of London who had made two prior voyages to Spitsbergen (1610‚Äì11). Upon reaching Spitsbergen they discovered such an abundance of whales \\"that for a stretch of sixty leagues along the coast the sea was obscured.\\"Senning, Calvin F. Anglo-Spanish Rivalry in the Spitsbergen Whale Fishery, 1612-1616. American Neptune, Vol. 28 (October 1968), pp. 239-60. The Englishman Thomas Edge, master of the Sea Horse (180 tons), one of the two ships sent by the Muscovy Company to Spitsbergen, spoke with Woodcock while surveying the coast in a pinnace, reporting that the Basque ship had \\"made a full Voyage in Green-harbour\\", or Gr√∏nfjorden, on the south side of Isfjorden.Purchas, S. 1625. Hakluytus Posthumus or Purchas His Pilgrimes: Contayning a History of the World in Sea Voyages and Lande Travells by Englishmen and others. Volumes XIII and XIV (Reprint 1906 J. Maclehose and sons). On his return Woodcock spent sixteen months in the Gatehouse and Tower for leading a foreign vessel into an \\"English preserve\\". The expedition returned to Spain \\"with [such] glowing reports of the wealth of the fishery\\" that a patent was secured from the Viceroy of Navarre, Don Alonso de Idi√°quez, conde de Aramayona. Its report led others to send out a fleet of whaleships to Spitsbergen in 1613, including the ports of Holland, northern France, and the Basque provinces. San Sebastian sent out a dozen ships (one of them being the ship Woodcock had piloted the previous year), while Saint-Jean-de-Luz sent out three or four.Conway, W. M. 1906. No Man's Land: A History of Spitsbergen from Its Discovery in 1596 to the Beginning of the Scientific Exploration of the Country. Cambridge: At the University Press.Markham, C. R. 1881. The Voyages of William Baffin, 1612-1622. London: the Hakluyt Society. Only one of the ships of Saint-Jean-de-Luz was allowed to fish in Spitsbergen by the Muscovy Company, while all the others went up to try and break their monopoly. One of the Saint-Jean-de-Luz ships, the Grace-de-Dieu (700‚Äì800 tons), under Mignet de Haristiguy, sailed into \\"Schoonhoven\\" (modern Recherche Fjord), Bellsund on 16 June (OS), where they found the Dutchmen Willem Cornelisz. van Muyden. The Dutch cartographer Hessel Gerritsz (1613) says they agreed to fish together, and drive off any other vessels that came into their harbor, as they later did to a small ship of Saint-Jean-de-Luz. They were discovered by the English on 11 July (OS). Van Muyden was detained; while the great ship of Saint-Jean-de- Luz agreed to give half the oil they made to the English. The smaller vessel from Saint-Jean-de-Luz previously forbidden to fish by Van Muyden also agreed to give some of the oil they made to the English. Another little pinnace of Saint-Jean-de-Luz was said to be behind Eders Island in the mouth of \\"Zaandam Bay\\" (Van Keulenfjorden).Conway, W. M. 1904. Early Dutch and English Voyages to Spitsbergen in the Seventeenth Century. London. The ships of San Sebastian resorted to several bays on the west coast. The first was found by the English in Gr√∏nfjorden on 9 June (OS). Four were found in \\"Boules Bay\\" (Goeshaven), Hornsund on 13 June (OS), and another in Isfjorden on 19 June (OS). In all, the English found at least seven of the ships from San Sebastian, seizing their baleen and oil and taking their whaling gear and equipment before sending them home. The remaining five, unable to defend themselves against such encroachments, apparently left Spitsbergen upon learning they would share the same fate as their comrades if discovered by the English fleet. The San Sebastian merchants claimed a total loss of more than 200,000 ducats, threatening to seize the property of English merchants residing in San Sebastian. Fearing not only for their goods but for their lives as well, many of the English merchants fled to Bilbao, while others \\"dared not stir out of their houses lest they should be killed.\\" Formal protests were filed and diplomatic negotiations held, but nothing ever came of them. The Spanish ambassador to England, Diego Sarmiento de Acu√±a, conde de Gondomar, spoke with King James I about the matter, but was never able to receive satisfaction. Aguilar (1986), citing two secondary sources (Fernandez Duro 1881; Ciriquiain 1979) and one primary source (Colecci√≥n Vargas Ponce, Museo Naval (Madrid), 1613), states that Spanish Basque whaling had reached the \\"northernmost\\" coast of Greenland by 1613. Given the fact this is impossible (the northernmost coast of Greenland is inaccessible due to ice) and that the name Greenland was often applied to Spitsbergen, it seems likely that these sources were in reference to the vessels sent to Spitsbergen the same year. In 1614, a Basque ship was sighted by the English off Magdalenefjorden, and in 1615, a merchant in San Sebastian sent two ships from Bordeaux, L‚Äô Estinotte and Le Pellecan, under the commands of Jean de Lasso and Jean de Gramont, to Spitsbergen, but they were ordered away by the Dutch.Du Pasquier, Jean-Thierry (2000). Les baleiniers basques. Paris, SPM. In 1623, the Dane Johan Braem, in cooperation with Joanis de Haraneder of Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Miguel de Larralde of Ciboure, sent out two ships, La Joana and La Maria, to Spitsbergen. They sailed to Mauritius Bay and began to take out the whaling gear from the Danish huts at Smeerenburg, the main Dutch whaling complex on Amsterdam Island, on the northwest coast of Spitsbergen. They were discovered by the Dutch commander Cornelis Ys, and were ordered away by a threat of violence. In 1625, Braem again chartered two Basque ships and sent them to Spitsbergen. The few Dutch ships at Smeerenburg that season begrudgingly let them stay. With the Danish huts having been demolished and its shallops and other gear stolen by the Dutch and English the previous season, the Basque ships waited for the Dutch to leave in August and used their station and gear instead. In 1632, Braem chartered four ships, including two from Saint-Jean-de-Luz ‚Äì the Ste Marie, under Joannis de Segaroia, and Le Pigeon Blanc (\\"The White Pigeon\\"), under Peter Piasion (or Balcon). The two ships sailed to the newly built Danish station in \\"K√∏benhavens Bay\\" (modern Kobbefjorden, on the west coast of Danes Island). Both were ordered away by the admiral of the Dutch whaling fleet, J. J. Duynkercker. They sailed to the North Cape, where they waited for the Dutch fleet at Jan Mayen to sail home at the end of August. They landed at one of the two Dutch stations there and plundered it, breaking up storehouses and huts, ruining utensils, and destroying shallops and setting them adrift ‚Äì in all stealing 600 casks of oil and 200,000 lbs of baleen. With fully laden ships they sailed back to France, selling their plunder at Rouen and elsewhere for a handsome profit.Hacquebord, Louwrens (2004). \\"The Jan Mayen Whaling Industry\\" in Jan Mayen Island in Scientific Focus, Stig Skreslet, editor, Springer Verlag. Unable to gain a foothold at Spitsbergen, the Basques ventured offshore. Even here they met with trouble. In July 1637, the Fleur, of Ciboure, under Dominique Daguerre, who had been whaling between 73¬∞ and 76¬∞ N, made the mistake of straying as far north as 78¬∞ N, where he encountered the Danish man-of-war De To L√∏ver (\\"The Two Lions\\"), under Corfits Ulfeldt. Ulfeldt, who had been sent to Spitsbergen to protect Danish interests, led Daguerre to Kobbefjorden, where he seized 400 barrels of blubber and 100 quintals of baleen. Northern Norway In Finnmark (Northern Norway) the Basques received the same undue treatment they had met with in Spitsbergen and Iceland, this time from the Dano-Norwegian crown. Here, they hunted the \\"nordkaper\\" or North Atlantic right whale. One of the first may have been a Spanish Basque whaleship that was said to have been at Kjelvik, Mager√∏ya, in 1614. This may have been the same \\"Biscayan\\" ship that was forced to pay a fee of twenty \\"oxheads\\" of whale oil and 100 Spanish \\"Reales\\" to the sheriff at Vard√∏. The following year, 1615, a vessel from Mutriku went to Northern Norway, as well as two from San Sebastian and two from the French Basque region. The Dano-Norwegian crown, on hearing of unlicensed whalers fishing in their waters, sent a naval expedition to Northern Norway, confiscating 600 oxheads of oil from the San Sebastian ships and seizing one of the French Basques, confiscating 500 oxheads of oil from them, and sending the other vessel home. The presence of Basque whalers in these waters continued to be recorded into the 1620s. They may have sent expeditions to Northern Norway as late as 1688‚Äì90, as secondary literature claims that a whaleship out of San Sebasti√°n was present at Vannfjord, Mager√∏ya during those seasons. First pelagic whaling and later Arctic ventures In order to avoid having to pay fines to the sovereigns of northern lands (e.g. Spitsbergen, Finnmark), the Basques began using ship-board tryworks to process blubber into oil. This technique was introduced in 1635. Whales could now be caught and processed offshore. Off Northern Norway, French Basque whaleships reported hunted whales \\"√† flot\\", in other words, offshore ‚Äì for example, in 1659. Friderich Martens, who served as surgeon aboard a German whaleship in 1671, claimed that the \\"Frenchman (Basques) try up their train-oyl in their ships and by that means many ships are burnt at Spitzbergen; and this was the occasion of the burning of two ships in my time\\".Scammon, C. M. 1874. The Marine Mammals of the North- western Coast of North America: Together with an Account of the American Whale-fishery. Carmany and G. P. Putnam's. In the northeastern North Atlantic the Spanish Basques used vessels of smaller tonnage than those that took part in the Terranova voyages, which resulted in a somewhat lower haul per ship, partly because of their smaller overall length and partly because of the space the tryworks occupied. The French Basques employed 250-ton frigates (r. 100‚Äì350 tons) with reinforced stem-posts and timbers in order to withstand the rigors of whaling in the West Ice - the area between eastern Greenland and Spitsbergen. They were also fitted with six to fourteen cannons, as France and Holland were often at war during this period. Many of the French Basque ships, instead of returning to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Ciboure, or Bayonne (where they would have to transship their oil and bone), went into Le Havre or Honfleur in Normandy, where a large percentage of the whale oil market existed. Poor catches in the 1680s, and the War of the League of Augsburg (1688‚Äì97) caused a dramatic decline in French Basque whaling. By the early 18th century, only one or two vessels were left in the trade. Following the War of Spanish Succession, the French Basque fishery began to show signs of recovery. Perhaps because of the previous war, few experienced seaman were available for the trade, so they had to recruit Spanish Basques for their voyages. There were said to be twenty ships \\"from the ports in the Bay of Biscay\\" among the fleet of foreign whalers sent to the Davis Strait and the West Ice in 1721. Towards 1730 a \\"new period of prosperity\\" was reached with the fitting out of more than 30 whalers annually. This was followed by a rapid decline. The last Basque (French or Spanish) whaling expeditions were sent prior to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì63). Several attempts were made to revive the trade, but they were unsuccessful.

It is a succulent plant that is found growing only at a few dozen archaeological sites of the ancient Hohokam Indians in southern Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. In 1935 there were reported half a dozen sites and in 1970 only two were known. It appears to be a cultivar grown by the Hohokam for food and fiber. Its common names include Hohokam agave, Murphey agave, and Murphey's century plant.Agave murpheyi. Plant Abstracts. Arizona Game and Fish Department. Description This agave produces a rosette of leaves up to 80 centimeters long by 20 centimeters wide in shades of green to blue-green with pale banding. They develop a red coloration during flowering. The leaves may curl slightly toward the center. They are lined with small, straight teeth and tipped with a spine up to 2 centimeters long. The plant produces an inflorescence 3 to 4 meters tall with many flowers along the branches. The flowers are greenish with purple or brown tips and are up to 7.5 centimeters long. The fruit is a woody capsule 5 to 7 centimeters long containing seeds but these are rarely produced with the flowers aborting before the fruits form. Despite being untended for more than 500 years Hohokam agave continue to grow at a few old archaeological sites. This agave produces only by bulbils and hybridizes with Agave chrysantha in Arizona (almost all species labeled as Murphey agave are in fact hybrids with the Murphey agave being a hybrid of Agave palmeri x vivipara). Uses Agave murpheyi was cultivated by the Hohokam and possibly other Native Americans for both food and fiber. For food the basal rosette was harvested just before the Hohokam agave sent up a flower stalk. At this time the concentration of sugars in the rosette is at its highest. The rosettes, weighing about , were cooked for two or three days in a pit filled with hot stones and covered with hot coals and dirt. The baked rosette, compared in taste to a sweet potato (although containing inedible fiber), is nutritious with 347 calories and 3.5 grams of protein per 100 grams. Cultivation 200px Agaves collected from the wild were an important source of food for Native Americans for thousands of years. However, in the 1980s archaeologists discovered that large areas of agave especially Agave murpheyi had been cultivated by the Hohokam people in the Tucson Basin, near the city of Marana.Gregonis, L. M. (1996).The Hohokam. Sonorensis 16(1). Seventy-eight square kilometers (almost 20,000 acres) of former agave fields have been discovered mostly between Phoenix and Tucson indicating that the agave was a major source of food for the Hohokam who numbered in the tens of thousands. Undoubtedly many other fields have been destroyed or are undetected by archaeologists. Agave was cultivated by the Hohokam in the desert of the Tucson basin in rocky areas above the floodplain of the Santa Cruz river where more water-dependent crops were grown. The Hohokam planted agave in rockpiles about across and high. The pile of rocks around the base of the agave plant act as a mulch to help preserve moisture and prevent rodent predation. Check dams and contour terraces help channel the runoff from precipitation to the agave plants. About one-tenth of the Hohokam agave plants flowered each year and were harvested. The fields are dotted with the remains of large roasting pits for the agave. Rockpile cultivation began about 600 AD. Large-scale production characterized the classic period of Hohokam culture from 1150 to 1450. In one representative area, Marana, cultivation totalled . The production of agave in Marana is estimated to have been sufficient to provide 20% of the daily caloric needs of 775 people and the daily protein needs of 550 people. Moreover, because of its hardiness and low demand for moisture the agave was probably a very reliable crop in the drought-prone desert. Hohokam agave was apparently bred for human consumption by Native Americans over many generations. It has several advantages as a plant and food source over other agaves. The acidic juice in its leaves is less caustic than that of many agave species; the Hohokam agave is ready for consumption in late winter and early spring when other agricultural crops are not productive.How does our agave grow?

Most of the Greek Orthodox Christians live either in the capital city of Beirut, the Metn hinterland, the Hasbayya and Rashayya districts in the southeast, and the North Governorate, in the Koura region (south of Tripoli) and Akkar. Under the consensus of the unwritten agreement known as the National Pact among the different political leaders of Lebanon, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon and the Deputy Prime Minister of Lebanon are assumed to be Greek Orthodox Christians. History left The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch adheres to the Eastern Orthodox Church, which is composed of several autocephalous jurisdictions united by common doctrine and by their use of the Byzantine rite. They are the second largest Christian denomination within Christianity in Lebanon. Historically, these churches grew out of the four Eastern Patriarchates (Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople) of the original five major episcopal sees (the Pentarchy) of the Roman Empire which included Rome. The final split between Rome and the Eastern Churches, who came to oppose the views and claims of the Popes of Rome, took place in 1054. From that time, with the exception of a brief period of reunion in the fifteenth century, the Eastern Churches have continued to reject the claims of the Patriarchate of Rome (the Catholic Church) to universal supremacy and have rejected the concept of papal infallibility. Doctrinally, the main point at issue between the Eastern and Western Churches is that of the procession of the Holy Spirit and there are also divergences in ritual and discipline.An estimate of the area distribution of Lebanon's main religious groups The Greek Orthodox include many free- holders, and the community is less dominated by large landowners than other Christian denominations. In present-day Lebanon, Eastern Orthodox Christians have become increasingly urbanized, and form a major part of the commercial and professional class of Beirut and other cities. Many are found in the Southeast (Nabatieh/Beqaa) and North, near Tripoli. They are highly educated and well-versed in finance. The Greek Orthodox church has become known in the, possibly because it exists in various parts of the Arab world. The Greek Orthodox church has often served as a bridge between Lebanese Christians and the Arab countries. Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians have a long and continuous association with Eastern Orthodox Churches in European countries like Greece, Cyprus, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania. The church exists in many parts of the Arab world and Greek Orthodox Christians have often been noted; historically, it has had less dealings with Western countries than the Maronite Church, but have strong connections to Russia and Greece. The Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians are believed to constitute about 8% of the total population of Lebanon, including the Palestinian Greek Orthodox community, many of whom have been given Lebanese citizenship. Greek Orthodox Christians support a variety of political parties and factions, including non-sectarian parties such as the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party, and the Democratic Left Movement; and mostly Christian parties such as the Free Patriotic Movement, the Marada Movement, the Lebanese Forces, and the Kataeb.

In 1916, this miniature zoo housed only pigeons, rabbits, and deer which roamed in a fenced run. A small herd of elk were in residence by 1936 but not until the late 1950s were any really exotic animals added to the park's menagerie. At that time some of the deer were traded for a lion, a leopard, an Arctic wolf, a baboon, two barbary sheep, and several monkeys. A series of concrete-block shelters with fenced runs were constructed to house the new arrivals and others soon to be purchased from the Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey Circus. At one time, the City of Pawtucket had an arrangement with the circus to quarter numerous animals in the zoo for several months of the year. Its most famous resident was Fanny the elephant, who lived at the zoo for more than three decades. Suffering financially, much of the zoo was closed in the 1990s.\\"R.I.

It is one of the first Polish novels, and one of the most important works by Krasicki. It served as an inspiration future Polish novelists and other writers, including Adam Mickiewicz. History Krasicki wrote the first part in 1776, and it was published in 1778, without any indication of a sequel. Krasicki would however publish a second part in 1784, and write a third one, published posthumously in 1803. Krzy≈ºanowski writes that part four was planned, but never written. (from the Introduction by Krzy≈ºanowski, as reproduced at The novel was likely inspired by Krasicki's experiences with the Monitor newspaper, Renaissance works of ≈Åukasz G√≥rnicki and the treatise on peasants by Hans Caspar Hirzel. Plot Ignacy Krasicki The novel does not have much of a plot, it has been described as \\"unashamedly utilitarian\\", more of a \\"didactic treatise\\", almost a manifesto of Krasicki's reformist ideals. The titular hero, a local noble holding the office of podstoli in his land, is a model szlachta noble-landowner, as imagined by the Enlightened conservatism ideals. Krasicki often compares the order of his home and estate with the customs and life of the Polish Sarmatian countryside. The novel's message is the need for moral restoration, criticizing both the slavish keeping of old traditions, as well as reckless abandonment of them in exchange for the foreign novel customs. For the novel's role model, being a noble is not just a case of being born into the class, a proper noble should act in specific way. One of the Enlightened themes of the novel can be seen in its treatment of peasants serfs, whom the main character sees as human beings, with potential of achieving freedom through education. The novel's protagonist is an unnamed narrator, who in Part 1 spends several weeks in the house of Podstoli, located somewhere in the Lesser Poland. In Part 2 he returns to his village, to implement reforms based on the model he has seen in Podstoli's village. In Part 3 he returns to Podstoli's manor for a wedding of his daughter. Significance Pan Podstoli was seen as one of the first Polish novels (incidentally Krasicki was also the one to publish the first one, The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom, in 1776), and is one of the most important works by Krasicki. It served as an inspiration future Polish novelists and other writers, including Adam Mickiewicz, who likely drew upon it in his representation of idealized noble life portrayed in his Pan Tadeusz (1834). The work has spawned a number of similar works in Poland (1786 KsiƒÖdz Pleban and 1788 Obywatel by J√≥zef Kazimierz Kossakowski and 1786 Pani Podczaszyna by Micha≈Ç Dymitr Krajewski) and even a sequel (Pan Podstolic by Edward Tomasz Massalski published in five parts in the period 1831‚Äì1833).

Narayaniah Case is a suite filed by Jiddu Narayaniah, father of J. Krishnamurti in 1912 against theosophist Annie Besant for the custody of his son. The case argued for Narayaniah by C. P. Ramaswami Iyer was won by him and was a cause c√©l√®bre of the time though Besant later appealed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and got a ruling in her favour. Besant and C.P. Ramaswami Iyer who were in opposing camps during the trial eventually became friends after the case got over and jointly participated in the Home Rule Movement.  Krishnamurti's adoption by The Theosophical Society  J. Krishnamurti belonged to a Niyogi Brahmin family from Chittoor district of the then Madras Presidency. In 1907, Krishnamurti's father Narayaniah settled down in Madras city and was offered a job at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society in Adyar. He brought his sons Narayanian and Nityananda with him. In July 1909, the theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater chanced upon Krishnamurti on the banks of the Adyar River and allegedly noticed signs of greatness in him. Convinced that Krishnamurti was destined to be a prophet, Leadbeater induced the Theosophical Society to adopt Krishnamurti and his younger brother Nityananda. Narayaniah was given a nominal compensation. Krishnamurti, eventually, came under the custody of Annie Besant who tutored him.  The suit  Not satisfied with the terms of the settlement, Narayaniah sued Annie Besant and the Theosophical Society. The case was first brought to the Chingleput District Court whose sitting judge referred the case to the Madras High Court. Narayaniah's brief was argued by C. P. Ramaswami Iyer who later served as Advocate-General of Madras Presidency, cabinet minister and Diwan of Travancore. He was assisted by his juniors N. Chandrasekhara Iyer and M. Subbaraya Aiyar. Annie Besant did not solicit any lawyer and argued the case on her own. Public opinion was strong in support of Narayaniah as many felt that he had been robbed of his sons. Among the prominent men who supported Narayaniah were S. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, editor of The Hindu and retired judge S. Subramania Iyer. The case was eventually won by C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. On April 15, 1913, Judge Bakewell ordered Besant to hand over custody of the two young boys to their father.  Aftermath  Besant approached the Privy Council which ordered a retrial. On 29 October 1913, after a hearing, judge C. A. White directed that the boys be handed over to her. The Brahmin leaders who had opposed Besant sided with her and supported her during the Home Rule movement. This alliance alienated other communities and was vehemently criticized by the media arm of the newly formed Justice Party. S. Subramania Iyer, however, refused to compromise with Besant and ridiculed the Society's projection of J. Krishnamurti as a messiah until his death in 1924.

Written by Dorrell and Stuart E. McGowan, the film is about a singing cowboy who helps protect a county from fever-ridden cattle, and after being framed for murdering the sheriff, proves his innocence, gets elected sheriff, and then goes after the bad guy. Plot Colima County, Texas has barred the entry of cattle from fever-ridden Sage County, where two unscrupulous schemers, Morhan and Conner, have raised thousands of head of the cattle suffering from Texas Cattle Fever. The cattle are secretly owned by leading citizen Dave Morgan (J.P. McGowan). While driving the diseased cattle to a railhead for shipping, they cross a corner of Colima Country and are spotted and fired upon by Marjorie Miller (Dorothy Dix), daughter of Sheriff Ed Miller (Jack Rockwell). The outlaws are about to kidnap the girl when Gene Autry (Gene Autry), Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), and Shorty (Frankie Marvin) arrive on the scene and rescue the girl. Gene and his sidekicks are traveling with Professor Parker's traveling medicine show. Morgan stages a town meeting and tries to prove that the fever is not contagious with the help of quack veterinarian Dr. Schaefer (Harrison Greene). Morgan's plan is foiled by Professor Parker (Earle Hodgins), a real veterinarian who emphatically states that the disease is contagious. After the townspeople run Schaefer out of town and vote to support the quarantine, Connor orders Gene to leave town by five o'clock or face the consequences. Gene makes it clear that he is staying and Professor Parker and his troupe conduct their show. Meanwhile, Sheriff Miller and Deputy Clark are riding on the trail and discussing the case when they are ambushed by Connor and Sam who leave the lawmen for dead. Gene and Frog find the lawmen; Clark is dead, but Miller is still alive. Gene decides to keep their discovery secret until they can find Clark's killer. Meanwhile, Morgan is determined to get his henchman, Frank Hall (Pascale Perry), elected sheriff so that he can drive his infected cattle to auction. The opposing candidate is driven away by threats from Morgan's men. The people then nominate Gene to run against Hall. Desperate to undermine Gene's canidacy, Morgan finds Miller's handcuffs and badge in Gene's hotel room and accuses Gene of killing Miller. he tries to have him arrested, but Gene escapes. With little hope of Gene winning the election now, Marjorie organizes the town's women, and all of them convince their men to vote for Gene, who wins the election by a landslide. Morgan and his men make one last attempt to drive their cattle across the county. Gene organizes a posse and goes after Morgan's men. Following a shootout, they chase Morgan and Connor and trick them into revealing that they know where Miller and Clark were hidden, thereby confirming their guilt. Sheriff Miller congratulates Gene and Frog as they put Morgan and Connor in jail. With peace restored in the town, Professor Parker's traveling medicine show moves on.

G. Herdman; 1805‚Äì1882) was an English author and painter, known for his scenes in the Liverpool area of England. Art Herdman was a self-taught painter who started sketching in his early teens, documenting the city of Liverpool, making notes about how the city and its buildings were changing as the city grew. Herdman painted around 2,000 watercolours of Liverpool scenes which were included in the book, Herdman‚Äôs LiverpoolHerdman, William Gavin. Herdman‚Äôs Liverpool. Jaggard & Company: Liverpool. 1874 which appeared in several editions after his death in 1882. Herdman is best known as a landscape painter, typically of scenes around Liverpool. Herdman exhibited landscapes at the Royal Academy from 1834 to 1861. He joined the Liverpool Academy of Arts in 1836. In 1857 he left the Liverpool Academy over their annual award to Sir John Everett Millais for his The Blind Girl. Herdman then established the rival Institution of Fine Arts. The local academies were run along similar lines to the Royal Academy, holding exhibitions of the work of local artists alongside that of leading artists of the day including John Landseer and his son Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, as well as Ford Madox Brown, William Holman Hunt, and Millais. Because of conflicts within the Artist Community, both Academies closed by 1870.Wood, Christopher (Editor) The Dictionary of Victorian Painters, 2nd Edition. Baron Publishing, Church Street, Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. 1978. p 219. Herdman was a teacher and a successful commercial artist. He took commissions and after completing a series of paintings of scenes around Liverpool, which were also used to illustrate Herdman's books. The Pictorial Relics of Ancient Liverpool contained 62 drawings on 49 plates, which he published in 1843 and 1856. Other publications include A Treatise of Curvilinear Perspectives and its applications to Art published in 1854 and Thoughts on Speculative cosmology and the principles of Art published in 1870. Personal life Herdman had 11 sons and five daughters; some were successful artists in their own right: William, William Patrick, John Innes, and Stanley. At least one of his daughters was an art teacher. Herdman's son, also called William, was a very successful painter. Watercolors signed in full or with the initials WGH are by Herdman senior. Those signed ‚ÄúWilliam Herdman‚Äù are by his son. Herdman was appointed secretary of the Liverpool Society but found himself at odds with the membership. Herdman painted from real life, not the imaginary world of the Pre-Raphaelites, and he objected when the Pre-Raphaelites were continually awarded the Academy‚Äôs annual prizes. Herdman resigned in 1857 and the following year, he founded the Liverpool Society of Fine Arts. The rivalry between the two institutions resulted in the closure of both, the Society in 1862 and the Academy in 1865. Herdman lived at 41 Domingo Vale, Everton. Herdman's obituary is in the Liverpool Mercury, Saturday 1 April 1882.

Master Abdullah began his film career in 1962 with an Urdu language film Suraj Mukhi (1962). He got his big breakthrough in the Pakistani film industry with a super-hit Punjabi language film Malangi (1965 film). Music in this film composed by Master Abdullah was superb and most of the film songs became extremely popular among the Pakistani public in the 1960s and still are fondly listened to this day. Master Abdullah's music tunes were hard and complicated to make but he did this job so well. Whether he was making happy or tragic music tunes, Master Abdullah was considered to be equally bold, skillful and innovative. For evidence, we have dozens of his super-hit film songs that he left behind as his legacy.

His father, Khushi Mohammad, was also singer- musician in his time. Young Rasheed acquired his initial music lessons from Khan Sahib Ashfaq Husain. Sharp enough in the field of learning music, Rasheed soon mastered the musical instruments in general and tabla, in particular. In the early 1940s, Rasheed decided to consolidate his efforts towards music composition and started his music career from Mahishori pictures, Lahore, for whom he composed two songs for the film Pagli. The rest of (Pagli)'s songs were composed by Ustaad Jhanday Khan. Rashid Attre was selected as the music director to compose songs for the Bombay Talkies' first Muslim social film Nateeja (1947), whose superhit ghazal ‚ÄòKahan mein aur kahan deen-e-haram ki kashmakash, Nakhshab, kis kay naqsh-e-pa per rakh diya ghabra kay sar mein nay' is popular to date. Once he migrated to Pakistan with his family, he was not able to take full advantage of noted singer Noor Jehan's singing talent initially, because Noor Jehan, in those days, would sing only for those films in which she also acted. So Rashid Attre used playback singers Zubaida Khanum and Naseem Begum in the early years of his career in Pakistan. Later, when Noor Jehan changed her mind, he composed music for many popular songs by her before he died in 1967.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Southard lived in the city for nearly his entire life. He attended Boston Latin School and completed his education at Harvard University. At Harvard, Southard distinguished himself as a chess player. After briefly studying in Germany, he returned to the United States as a pathologist at Danvers State Hospital. Southard held academic appointments at Harvard University and its medical school. He headed the Boston Psychopathic Hospital when it opened in 1912, pioneering the study of brain pathology with particular interests in shell shock and schizophrenia. Southard published several books, including Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems with nearly 1,000 case histories. He was president of the American Medico- Psychological Association and the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, and held advisory positions with the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the Eugenics Record Office. An influential mentor, Southard guided several well- known figures in medicine and psychology. He worked with neuropathologist Myrtelle Canavan early in her career, and used his influence to obtain a promotion for her in Boston. Southard introduced Karl Menninger to psychiatry, and Menninger later helped establish the foundation which bears his family name. Comparative psychologist Robert Yerkes called Southard \\"my master of psychopathology.\\" Southard was married to physician and Wellesley College professor Mabel Fletcher Austin, and they had three children. His interest in chess continued throughout his life, and he enjoyed intellectual gatherings at the home of art collector and friend Walter Arensberg. At the age of 43, Southard died of pneumonia in 1920 during a trip to New York City to deliver lectures to two medical societies. Early life Southard was born in Boston in 1876 to Martin Southard and Olive Wentworth Knowles. His paternal ancestors included Mayflower passenger and Plymouth Colony leader Myles Standish. Olive Southard was descended from early residents of New Hampshire and Maine. Frederick Parker Gay, one of E. E. Southard's longtime friends and his posthumous biographer, wrote that Southard's parents were only modestly successful academically. His mother was a schoolteacher for several years; his father, who supervised a cotton-waste factory and established a trucking business, earned enough money to ensure that Southard did not have to work during his undergraduate and graduate studies. Southard's mother said that once he learned to read, he took full responsibility for his education. He was influenced academically by a paternal aunt, a Greek scholar who had graduated from Oberlin College. One of his cousins was a prominent attorney in Bath, England. Southard attended Boston Latin School, where his father, aunt and headmaster Arthur Irving Fiske sparked a lifelong interest in language and the meaning of words. Despite a tall, solid build and walking about a day to school, he was awkward at manual labor and athletics. Southard graduated from Boston Latin School in 1893 with awards for reading and essay-writing. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College in 1897. As an undergraduate, Southard's path was shaped by several notable faculty members. He learned about comparative anatomy and the nervous system from biologist George Howard Parker, studied psychology under William James, took a class in logic taught by Josiah Royce and graduated with a degree in philosophy. Southard then entered Harvard Medical School; despite his previous academic success and aptitude for science he struggled in several courses focused on medicine, receiving C's and a D. At Harvard Southard was a noted chess player, and was described as Harvard's best player in an 1899 newspaper article on an Ivy League chess tournament: \\"It is probable that as long as he is engaged in the tournament, Harvard will win the cup.\\" Through the chess team he became lifelong friends with Walter Arensberg, who became a noted art collector. Southard received his medical degree in 1901. In 1902, Southard went to Germany and studied medicine at the Senckenberg Institute and Heidelberg University for six months. Career=Appointments Danvers State Hospital, where Southard held a faculty appointment early in his career After returning from Germany, Southard interned in pathology at Boston City Hospital and became an instructor at Harvard Medical School in 1904. From 1906 to 1909, he was an assistant pathologist at Danvers State Hospital. Socially, he participated in the Wicht Club with other young Harvard scholars beginning their careers. In 1909 Southard was named assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University and Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at Harvard Medical School, titles he held until his death. That year, he also became a pathologist for the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases. Southard and his laboratory assistant, Emma Mooers, contracted a streptococcal infection during an autopsy in 1911. Mooers died and Southard developed lymphangitis in his arm, undergoing aggressive surgery and recovering over several months. Although he wrote an outline of his autobiography and traveled extensively in Europe during his convalescence, he felt unable to concentrate on research and referred to this period as \\"the wasted year\\". Southard led the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, which had opened as a department of Boston State Hospital, from 1912 until his death. He served in a strategic advisory role with the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service during World War I, attaining the rank of major. Southard was a past president of the American Medico- Psychological Association, and was president of the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology at his death. Other professional memberships included the American Genetic Association, the National Epilepsy Association, the American Association of Pathologists, the Massachusetts Medical Society and the Society of Experimental Biology. He served in an editorial capacity for several publications, including the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. Southard was a member of the Board of Scientific Directors for the Eugenics Record Office (ERO). Led by biologist Charles Davenport, the ERO lobbied for state sterilization laws and restrictions on U.S. immigration. Public approval of the office waned during the 1930s (when eugenics became associated with Nazism), and the ERO closed in 1939. Southard coined the word \\"cacogenics\\" for the study of racial decline. Professional contributions Southard studied the organic basis of mental illness at a time when two camps of professionals (known informally as \\"brain spot men\\" and \\"mind twist men\\") debated the biological and behavioral manifestations of psychiatric disorders. His neuropathological perspective was eclipsed after his death by the \\"mind twist\\" hypothesis of mental illness promoted by the dynamic psychiatry (or psychobiology) of Adolf Meyer and the psychoanalytic perspectives of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Alfred Adler. Although physiological theories of \\"autointoxication\\" were explored in U.S. psychiatry before 1940, Southard had long ago rejected them. During the World War I era, Southard conducted early studies of shell shock. He believed that shell shock resulted from the mind's inability to align the sensory experiences of war with other life events. Southard said that this process, which could also have physical causes, resulted in disorientation and transformed the events of war into a mental condition. In Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems, he called the term \\"shell shock\\" advantageous because it \\"compared with the more acutely terrible and life-in-the-balance thing we know as traumatic or surgical shock.\\" The condition initially captured public interest, at least in part because it was thought to result from a traumatic force to the head. When shell shock became known as not resulting from physical injuries, patients were stigmatized and arguments over its cause interfered with effective treatment. At the end of the war, Southard returned to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized. He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology. Although Southard expressed a great deal of interest in research, he was most inclined to work on the classification, nomenclature and definition of psychiatric and philosophical concepts. He said he realized that such work was ridiculed by many, but a \\"psychiatric dictionary (to include definitions of every near-lying psychological and philosophical term also) would do more to push mental hygiene on than any other single thing I can think of.\\" Southard proposed an eleven-category classification system for psychiatric diagnoses, which was not adopted. He was particularly interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published. Southard and Mary Jarrett founded the field of psychiatric social work, applying psychiatry to industrial employees. The Kingdom of Evils, a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death. In his introduction to the book, physician Richard Cabot wrote that it highlighted the collaboration between doctor and social worker; the physician excels at diagnosis, and the social worker is better able to provide resources for treatment. Influence Southard and Myrtelle Canavan At Danvers State Hospital Southard met Myrtelle Canavan, with whom he worked and published in neuropathology for the next few years. When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was enough for her to refuse the Pennsylvania offer. Southard also mentored Karl Menninger during Menninger's internship at Boston Psychopathic Hospital. Menninger planned to join his father, general practitioner Charles Frederick Menninger, in practice. Southard steered Karl Menninger's interests toward mental health; the Menninger Foundation was later established with a focus on psychiatry, and Karl Menninger became president of the American Psychoanalytic Association. The Menninger family opened the Southard School, a teaching facility for mentally-ill children, several years after Southard's death. Southard had considerable influence on the early career of comparative psychologist Robert Yerkes. Working in the philosophy department at Harvard, Yerkes was passed over for promotions because he had only studied animals. Southard asked him to design mental testing techniques applicable to patients at the psychopathic hospital, and Yerkes received a half-time appointment at Boston Psychopathic with Southard from 1913 to 1917. Shortly afterwards, Yerkes was elected president of the American Psychological Association and developed the U.S. Army's mental testing program during World War I. In his autobiography, Yerkes called Southard \\"my master of psychopathology.\\" Personal life Horace Austin, former governor of Minnesota and Southard's late father-in-law In 1906 Southard married Mabel Fletcher Austin, a Wellesley College mental-hygiene lecturer and Johns Hopkins University graduate. She was the daughter of former Minnesota governor Horace Austin. Southard wrote to Frederic Parker Gay about the limitations his professional responsibilities placed on his marriage: \\"Mabel is her own cook, maid and bath steward, as for her being a wife, I have little or no time to be a husband.\\" Southard had three children: a daughter, Anne, and two sons. His younger son Ordway was an early writer of English- language haiku and published under several names, including O. Mabson Southard, O.M.B. Southard and Mabelsson Norway. He was a Communist Party candidate in the 1942 Alabama gubernatorial election. Southard's older son, Austin, developed schizophrenia and committed suicide several years after his father's death. The elder Southard's life was often busy and sleepless. According to L. Vernon Briggs, a colleague at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Southard considered himself hypomanic. \\"He himself said that most people fell within one of the classifications of mental disease, and he felt himself to be of the manic-depressive type. We seldom saw the depressive side of him though it was undoubtedly there; ordinarily he appeared carried away with enthusiasm about his latest interest ‚Äì and everything worthwhile interested him\\", Briggs wrote. Southard experienced chronic headaches and minor seizures (sometimes accompanied by partial vision loss for several hours), which he attributed to mental strain. A 1901 episode kept him in Boston City Hospital for a week, and Southard said he was diagnosed with \\"acute brain tire\\". A similar event several years later was diagnosed as vascular neurosis. According to Gay, a physical examination several months before Southard's death may have indicated an endocrine gland problem, but no specific condition was diagnosed. A member of two local chess clubs, Southard was described in his New York Times obituary as \\"one of the foremost amateur chess players in America\\". He often arrived at his laboratory after spending the night playing chess. After his death, in \\"metaphors more appropriate for a comet than a man\\", friends described the intellect which allowed Southard to play up to six blind chess matches simultaneously. At Danvers State Hospital, he introduced a move he called the Danvers Opening. Southard frequently traveled from Boston to New York City to participate in Walter Arensberg's salons, bringing scholarship to discussions of contemporary social-science topics. Arensberg was also friends with artists such as Marcel Duchamp. Southard analyzed the dreams of Arensberg's guests, and discussed the meaning of Duchamp's work with the artist. Perhaps influenced by Arensberg and his friends, Southard began to write experimental poetry. He was a member of the Wicht Club, a social and intellectual group of young Harvard academics. Death Southard traveled to New York City on February 1, 1920 to lecture to medical societies. He spoke to the Society of Neurology of New York on February 3, and delivered a mental- hygiene lecture at the New York Academy of Medicine the following day before developing pneumonia on February 5. Despite care by three Presbyterian Hospital physicians at the Prince George Hotel, Southard died on February 8, at the age of 43. Canavan became the acting laboratory director at Boston Psychopathic after his death. In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain and those of his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries at the base of his brain were small, but the significance of this finding was unclear. The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father. Canavan later wrote that Southard had experienced \\"singular difficulties producing considerable mental discomfort\\" during the last year of his life. According to her, he sensed his impending death and felt pressure to complete his unfinished research tasks. Canavan quoted him as saying, \\"I shall not live long, I must hurry; I must get lots of others busy.\\" Works * Outline of Neuropathology (1906) * Neurosyphilis: Modern Systematic Diagnosis and Treatment, Presented in One Hundred and Thirty-seven Case Histories (1917) ‚Äì with H.C.

Film Saperan (1961) was another hit film and the song Chand Sa Mukhra Gora Badan was another super-hit film song which gained singer Ahmed Rushdi his first Nigar Award. Thus this two-music-directors-team was created that went by the name Manzoor - Ashraf. Both musicians worked with each other from 1956 to 1967 and then M. Ashraf decided to go solo in 1967 with film Sajda (1967). Manzoor Ashraf duo or team had musicians Master Manzoor and Muhammad Ashraf in it. Together, they composed music in 26 films in the 1960s. After separation from music director Master Manzoor, his first film as M Ashraf alone was Sajda in 1967. In the 1970s, he reached the peak of his film career and composed music for many big hit films. He continued his successful march in the 1980s despite the downfall of Urdu films and a dominance of Punjabi films. \\"M. Ashraf's musical journey ended with Tere Bin Jiya Na Jaye (2005). Playback singers introduced by him Famous folk singer Shaukat Ali was introduced in film director Haidar Chodhary's inaugural super- hit musical film Tees Mar Khan in 1963. Naheed Akhtar was introduced by him in film Nanha Farisha in 1974 with the song: \\"Janey kyun dil tarapta rehta hay, Aao jee addi tappa gaen\\". Nayyara Noor actually had her first appearance in Punjabi film Ziddi (1973 film) but her first super- hit song was composed by M Ashraf. Rajab Ali appeared in his film Yaden in 1971 with a super hit duet song with Noor Jehan. Asad Amanat Ali Khan was introduced by M Ashraf in film Saheli (1978). M Ashraf set new records in Pakistan (recorded thousands of film songs) working mainly with 5 major film playback singers of his time, namely with Noor Jehan, Mehdi Hassan, Naheed Akhtar, Masood Rana, and Ahmed Rushdi while also introducing new talent such as Ghulam Abbas, A. Nayyar, Alamgir, Mohammed Ali Shehki, Rajab Ali, Anwar Rafi and many other upcoming new artists of that era to the broader audience of movies and pop radio airplays.

Along the same lines as the Latin \\"carpe diem\\" (\\"seize the day\\"), it is a call to live life to its fullest extent, even embracing behavior which carries inherent risk. It became a popular internet slang term in 2012.  Background  Similar phrases have been in use for more than a century, including these: * the English translation of \\"one lives but once in the world\\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe from his 1774 German play Clavigo; * the title of an 1855 waltz, \\"Man lebt nur einmal!\\" (\\"You Only Live Once!\\") by ; * and the Latin phrases, \\"memento mori\\" (\\"remember [that you have] to die\\") and \\"carpe diem\\" (\\"seize the day\\"). Emergence of acronym In 2012, the acronym \\"YOLO\\" became a staple of music and youth culture, being a subject of graffiti, Twitter hashtags, pranks, tattoos, music, television shows and merchandise. The acronym was most popularized by Canadian rapper Drake, who planned to release a 2011 joint mixtape titled YOLO along with American rapper Rick Ross. To promote this mixtape, \\"YOLO\\" was mentioned prominently on several of their tracks such as \\"The Motto\\", released on November 29, 2011, with the aim of promoting the tape. This use is said to have elevated the word into prominence and common colloquial use. In late 2012, Drake expressed a desire to obtain royalties for use of \\"YOLO\\" due to the proliferation of merchandise bearing the phrase and lyrics from his song, which have been commonly seen at stores such as Walgreens and Macy's, but he does not own a trademark on the word. Hip-hop magazine Da South reported that the rapper Lecrae has deconstructed the phrase \\"YOLO\\" in his 2012 song \\"No Regrets\\". In the opening monologue of Saturday Night Live on January 19, 2014, Drake apologized about pop culture's adoption of the phrase, saying he had no idea it would become so big.  In popular culture  Use of the phrase by comedian and actor Mae West helped popularise it in the 20th century. A restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has held a trademark to the phrase \\"YOLO\\" in the context of the frozen yogurt business since 2010. American comedy trio The Lonely Island released a 2013 song titled \\"YOLO\\", featuring Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar, parodying the phrase and the people who use it as a lifestyle meme. The song charted in a few countries, including #60 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Reception  Online media including The Washington Post and The Huffington Post described YOLO in 2012 as the \\"newest acronym you'll love to hate\\" and \\"dumb\\". The word was criticized for its use in conjunction with reckless behavior, most notably in a Twitter post by aspiring rapper Ervin McKinness just prior to his death, caused by driving drunk at 120 mph (193 km/h): \\"Drunk af going 120 drifting corners #FuckIt YOLO.\\" References Lifestyles Acronyms 2010s slang Hashtags ","title":"YOLO (aphorism)"},{"id":"36013741","text":"The J.W.

Jefferies stated that after the show premiered, his influence in the show was increasingly reduced, and that he was ultimately fired and left without his promised share of fees and merchandising royalties from the series, purportedly due to network executives after a January 2012 report on TMZ that indicated that the Pawn Stars cast were taken aback by the History Channel's launch of the spinoff Cajun Pawn Stars, of which the cast had been unaware.

Disappearance and investigation Adams' ex-boyfriend, Steven Norris, and parents reported her missing on 25 June 1978 after she failed to arrive home from the dance. Although police initially believed that the car she entered was a green Kombi van, Norris, as the main eyewitness, stated that he saw her enter a light-coloured 1977 Holden panel van. Police who investigated the case originally cast suspicion on Norris. Eventually he was cleared, and suspicion widened to those involved in the drug scene. In the days after the attacks, a number of female rape victims, who had been assaulted by two disguised men, began to report a series of then-unknown crimes to police. Investigators then suspected that Adams' disappearance was linked to the 14 now-known violent rapes that had occurred in the Northern Beaches between 1971 and 1978, and may also be related to an attempted attack on a hitchhiker earlier that same evening. On 16 August 1978, a reward of $20,000 was offered by the New South Wales Government, and over the years, her suspected murder has been investigated by police four times.

Tween, who had also been a police informant, however, denied any involvement in the Adams and rape cases (despite circumstantial evidence), and died in 2013. * In 2011, an inquest was held in order to further investigate the disappearance of Adams, which resulted in the Coroner declaring that Adams died of \\"homicide or misadventure.\\" * In 2018, interest in the case was reignited by the airing of the second series of the ABC podcast series Unravel and TV documentary Barrenjoey Road.

Development was halted when the studio was closed. Development Human Element is the first game being developed by the independent game company Robotoki, which was formed by Robert Bowling after he left Infinity Ward following the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The premise of the game centers on the question, \\"What is the greatest threat in a zombie apocalypse?\\"; Bowling believes it is the fear that the walking dead instill in the survivors, who lead them to do unreasonable things to survive. The game focuses on the survivors more so than the zombies, \\"the human element\\", and takes place 35 years after the zombie apocalypse began. It can be played across multiple devices; an example given is that one player could play the console version for hundreds of hours, just for the action, whereas an intelligent class player, playing on a tablet, can join into the previous player's alliance and scavenge for them, and then benefit from the buffs given by the strength class of the alliance. Although it isn't the same experience, players all contribute to the overall goal of survival. There are three attributes players can choose when creating their character: class, identity, and persona. Class types include action, intelligence, and stealth, with each offering a number of different abilities. Identity choices include a solo adult, partnered adult, or adult with child, and is the same as selecting a difficulty at the start of the game. Persona determines a player‚Äôs sex and race. Bowling states, \\"how you choose to start in the world will determine how you can engage and impact in the scenarios you will be presented with on a physical and moral level that you approach this world.\\" The game was announced on June 1, 2012, and more details were released in the July edition of Game Informer. On July 19, 2012, Robotoki's president Robert Bowling announced that Human Element would have an episodic prequel released exclusively on the Ouya, as a first-party title. But it was later announced that the studio decided to cancel the Ouya version of Human Element \\"very early on\\" and switch focus to the open-world experience on other more powerful platforms. Robotoki was shut down on January 20, 2015 due to lack of publishing deal of the premium version of the game and the inability of the founder of the company to self-fund the development of the game.

It formerly consisted of six apartments of six rooms per wing, for a total of 18 apartments.Barbara Solomon, The Bishop Court Apartments It is built in Neo-Tudor style, and is reflective of a 15th- century English manor house. Its facade is polychrome Scottish sandstone. The metal grille in the archway entrance was added in the 1970s. History The Bishop Court Apartments were built on land that was formerly a cricket field. The building was constructed in 1904 for C$50,000. The plans were prepared by Saxe and Archibald for Robert Neville Jr. Charles Jewett Saxe (1870-1943) has also worked on the Ernest Comier Building, the Montreal Technological Institute, and Emmanuel United Church. Between 1953 and 1956, De Maisonneuve Boulevard (then Burnside Street) was widened between Stanley Street and Guy Street to provide more room for automobile traffic. The adjacent building was demolished, leaving Bishop Court with a blank wall facing De Maisonneuve Boulevard. Concordia University began leasing the building in 1975 to provide offices for its senior administration. Following the threat of its demolition in 1976, the Government of Quebec recognized the facade on Bishop Street, as well as the interior courtyard, as historic sites. Concordia purchased the building in February 1981. The building was renovated extensively in 1975 for C$600,000 to adapt it into offices from residential units. The renovations were controversial at the time, although contributed to preventing the building from being demolished. It was renovated again in 1995.

Within ten years trade had increased to $110,000, staff productivity had more than doubled (to $9,200 per clerk), expenses had fallen from 16 to 11 percent of turnover and profits were averaging 10 percent. Smallman and Ingram expanded their business by acquiring new premises in 1892. They purchased adjacent properties and added shoe and toy departments (only to be discarded as insufficiently profitable). Soon an even larger location was secured. By the turn of the century the store employed more than 100 clerks. Smallman bought Ingram's interest at the latter's death in January 1901, bringing his own nephew and two of Ingram's children into the business. It was incorporated in 1908. Smallman suffered a nervous breakdown and two strokes. He died on 14 February 1916. His obituary stated that he never mixed in politics, was a member of First Methodist Church and supported the Children‚Äôs Aid Society and the Irish Benevolent Society. The bulk of his shares in his business were bequeathed to the Western University of London, Ontario.

Her marriage to William Hale \\"Bill\\" Harkness, an attorney and heir to the Standard Oil fortune of William L. Harkness, made her one of the wealthiest women in America. Early life Rebekah Semple West was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1915. She was the second daughter of three children to Allen Tarwater West, a stockbroker and co-founder of G. H. Walker & Co., and Rebekah Cook (n√©e Semple) West. Her grandfather founded the St. Louis Union Trust Company. Raised primarily by nannies, Harkness took up dancing and ice skating to lose weight and was highly disciplined in both endeavors. She attended the Rossman School and John Burroughs School in St. Louis, and then the Fermata School for Girls in Aiken, South Carolina. Harkness was friends with a young Potter Stewart, whom she affectionately called \\"Potsie,\\" and their relationship was written about by her biographer Craig Unger. After graduating in 1932, she and a group of female friends formed the Bitch Pack, a sub-culture of local debutantes who enjoyed subverting society events, including lacing punchbowls with mineral oil and performing stripteases on banquet tables. Career In the 1960s, Harkness became well known as a philanthropist and patron of the arts. Through the Rebekah Harkness Foundation, Harkness sponsored Jerome Robbins and the Joffrey Ballet. When the Joffrey Ballet refused to rename their company in Harkness' honor, she withdrew funding and hired most of the Joffrey dancers to her new company, the Harkness Ballet. In addition to founding the Harkness Ballet, Harkness launched a ballet school and home for the company called Harkness House, as well as a refurbished 1,250-seat theater, which presented the Harkness Ballet and other dance companies to New York audiences. Through the William Hale Harkness Foundation, she sponsored construction of a medical research building at the New York Hospital and supported a number of medical research projects. Later in life, she studied in Fontainebleau, France, with Nadia Boulanger, at the Institut Jaques-Dalcroze in Geneva, and the Mannes College of Music, New York. She also studied orchestration with Lee Hoiby and received a Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, New Hampshire, in 1968. Marriages On June 10, 1939, Harkness married Dickson W. Pierce, the son of Thomas M. Pierce and a descendant of Franklin Pierce. Before their divorce in 1946, they had two children; Allen Pierce (b. 1940) and Anne Terry Pierce (b. 1944). Allen shot and killed a man in a brawl and was charged with second-degree murder, while Anne married Anthony McBride in 1966 and had a severely brain-damaged baby who died at age 10. On October 1, 1947, Harkness married William Hale Harkness (1900‚Äì1954), the son of William Lamon Harkness, both Standard Oil heirs. Before his death in August 1954, they had one child together; Edith Hale Harkness (1948‚Äì1982). Edith married Kenneth Perry McKinnon in 1971 and was in and out of mental institutions before eventually committing suicide. In 1961, Harkness married Ben Kean (c. 1912‚Äì1993), a physician who was a professor of Tropical Medicine at the Cornell Medical College. They divorced in 1965. In 1974, she married Niels H. Lauersen, another physician, who was 20 years her junior. They divorced in 1977. Death Harkness died of cancer in her Manhattan home on June 17, 1982. Her ashes were placed in a $250,000 urn designed by Salvador Dal√≠, then placed in the Harkness Mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery.The New York Times, 1988 In popular culture Harkness' \\"Holiday House\\" in Watch Hill, Rhode Island was acquired in 2013 by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. In 2020, Swift wrote the song \\"The Last Great American Dynasty\\" for her eighth studio album Folklore (2020), in which she tells Harkness' life story.

Pandora was founded in the 1880s as a mill town, serving as the site for mills of the Smuggler-Union, Tomboy, and Sheridan mines. The Rio Grande Southern railroad's Telluride branch terminated at the mills in Pandora. Milling largely ended during World War 2 (when by government order all precious metals mines were closed), by which time the townsite was largely covered in mill tailings. The Pandora Mill, previously one of the Smuggler Union mills, still stands at Pandora. The mill was constructed in 1920 to replace the previous Smuggler mill that had burned down. The mill had various periods of activity but was unusual in that it was one of the only gold mills in the country to stay open during World War II. The mill was allowed to remain open during the war due to the lead and zinc content of the ores processed there. Lead and zinc were needed for the war effort. Pandora, Colorado at Western Mining History The Pandora Mill ceased operations in 1978. In recent years the Idarado company has been reclaiming the mill tailings, and residential development of the site is anticipated.Jessen, Kenneth: Ghost Towns Colorado Style vol 3, p. 497.

The book won the Sally Hacker Prize for exceptional scholarship that reaches beyond academia to a broad audience in 2000. She appeared as a commentator in Ken Burns' 1992 documentary Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio. In 2010, her book Enlightened Sexism: The Seductive Message that Feminism's Work Is Done was published. In it, Douglas examines the evolution of the women in the media ‚Äì the rise of depictions of power and success giving credence to the idea of feminism having fulfilled its aims, and of sexist old-style depictions of women as sex objects ‚Äì and how these undermine women's status and equality. In March 2020, Douglas published In Our Prime: How Older Women are Reinventing the Road Ahead (Norton).

Each scene gradually progresses from an opening static lyric moment to a finale through several standard musical tempos and set pieces, gradually adding characters and adding or unraveling complexity in the plot. Because composers wrote operas in short spans of time, the standardized form of scenes ensured a time-tested dramatic and musical structure. The term itself comes from a work of criticism by Abramo BaseviBasevi 1859, p. 191  Origins  Opera in the 18th century tended to emphasize solo arias with very few ensemble numbers. Faced with this state of things and wanting to achieve new dramatic situations, Rossini and his librettists experimented with ensembles to make them dramatically integral to the opera while concomitantly allowing for their lyrical expression. Because Rossini's operas dominated early 19th-century Italian opera and because his solutions to musico-dramatic situations were so successful, his works came to be regarded as models that became part of a standardized convention.Gossett, 2006, p. 43.  Structural patterns  The form follows the basic pattern: *Introductory music, usually instrumental *Recitative or dialogue to an initial or basic tempo *Adagio/ Cavatina/ \\"Pezzo concertato\\" *\\"Tempo di mezzo\\" (middle movement, interlude, often sounds as if it is interrupting the action with entry of a third party)In Verdi's Il trovatore, act 3, the announcement that Azucena is to be put to death prompts Manrico to summon his forces in the famous \\"Di quella pira\\" *Cabaletta and (in the case of the final scene of an act), *Finale StrettaA History of Western Music Large arias within the scene fall into this basic pattern. Such arias are sometimes called cavatina/cabaletta arias: *Cantabile *Tempo di mezzo *Cabaletta An example of extended solita form may be found in act 3 of Verdi's La traviata: *Introduction: Prelude *Recitative: \\"Annina? Comandate\\" *Adagio: \\"Teneste la promessa\\" *Tempo di Mezzo: offstage chorus \\"Largo a quadrupede\\" *Cabaletta: \\"Signora...che t'accadde\\" The form then starts over: * Cantabile: \\"Parigi, o cara\\" * Tempo di Mezzo: \\"Ah, non pi√π....Ah, Violetta!

These included Colonel Robert Wallace, just returned from the Second Boer War in South Africa, who declined for business reasons; and Sir James Henderson, a previous Lord Mayor of Belfast. The shipbuilder and businessman William Pirrie (who had also been a Lord Mayor of Belfast) was also informally approached. They eventually picked Charles Buller, a former High Sheriff of Down and son-in-law of a previous MP for Belfast, George Dunbar. Thomas Sloan was a sub-contractor for the cementing of ship's floors at the shipyard of Harland and Wolff, who had during 1902 become a leading member of the working class Belfast Protestant Association, after the association's founder Arthur Trew was imprisoned for inciting an anti-Catholic riot. He declared his candidacy as an independent unionist in protest of the treatment of Trew.John F.

Issues and campaign The campaign was tumultuous, and the Belfast Protestant Association dominated the campaign, protesting the imprisonment of their founder. The Times reported that a final meeting for Dunbar Buller on 15 August was broken up by supporters of Slone, with only a large force of police preventing a more serious disturbance. Results The result of the election was announced outside Belfast town hall on the eve of election day, 18 August 1902. Sloan won the election by 826 votes, and was declared the new representative. Sloan later founded the Independent Orange Order and reached an agreement with the Irish Unionist Party to disassociate himself from the Belfast Protestant Association.

This special point is a triangle center and initiated the study of this triangle center in 1987. Yff central triangle of triangle ABC Isoscelizer An isoscelizer of an angle A in a triangle ABC is a line through points P1 and Q1, where P1 lies on AB and Q1 on AC, such that the triangle AP1Q1 is an isosceles triangle. An isoscelizer of angle A is a line perpendicular to the bisector of angle A. Isoscelizers were invented by Peter Yff in 1963. Yff central triangle Let ABC be any triangle. Let P1Q1 be an isoscelizer of angle A, P2Q2 be an isoscelizer of angle B, and P3Q3 be an isoscelizer of angle C. Let A'B'C' be the triangle formed by the three isoscelizers. The four triangles A'P2Q3, Q1B'P3, P1Q2C', and A'B'C' are always similar. There is a unique set of three isoscelizers P1Q1, P2Q2, P3Q3 such that the four triangles A'P2Q3, Q1B'P3, P1Q2C', and A'B'C' are congruent. In this special case the triangle A'B'C' formed by the three isoscelizers is called the Yff central triangle of triangle ABC. The circumcircle of the Yff central triangle is called the Yff central circle of the triangle. Yff center of congruence Animation showing the continuous shrinking of the Yff central triangle to the Yff center of congruence. The animation also shows the continuous expansion of the Yff central triangle until the three outer triangles reduce to points on the sides of the triangle. Let ABC be any triangle. Let P1Q1, P2Q2, P3Q3 be the isoscelizers of the angles A, B, C such that the triangle A'B'C' formed by them is the Yff central triangle of triangle ABC. The three isoscelizers P1Q1, P2Q2, P3Q3 are continuously parallel-shifted such that the three triangles A'P2Q3, Q1B'P3, P1Q2C' are always congruent to each other until the triangle A'B'C' formed by the intersections of the isoscelizers reduces to a point. The point to which the triangle A'B'C' reduces to is called the Yff center of congruence of triangle ABC. Properties Any triangle ABC is the triangle formed by the lines which are externally tangent to the three excircles of the Yff central triangle of triangle ABC. *The trilinear coordinates of the Yff center of congruence are ( sec( A/2 ) : sec ( B/2 ), sec ( C/2 ). *Any triangle ABC is the triangle formed by the lines which are externally tangent to the three excircles of the Yff central triangle of triangle ABC. *Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC. Let D be the point on side BC such that ‚à†BID = ‚à†DIC, E a point on side CA such that ‚à†CIE = ‚à†EIA, and F a point on side AB such that ‚à†AIF = ‚à†FIB. Then the lines AD.

Cosplay is a popular activity at fan conventions. The A Song of Ice and Fire fandom is an international and informal community of people drawn together by George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series, the HBO television series Game of Thrones, and the related merchandise. History During his years in television, Martin's novels slowly earned him a reputation in fiction circles, although he said to only receive a few fans letters a year in the pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. By 2005, Martin received tons of fan e-mails and was about 2000 letters behind that may go unanswered for years.  Ice and Fire Con  Tournament Melee at Ice and Fire Con 2018. Discussion Panel at Ice and Fire Con 2018. Ice and Fire Con (also known as A Con of Ice and Fire and A Convention of Ice and Fire) is a North American convention held annually in Mount Sterling, Ohio that celebrates George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy book series, as well as HBO's Game of Thrones television adaptation. Programming and traditions The convention's programming has included a Tourney of Champions since 2013, featuring \\"LARP\\"-based duels, melees, jousts, and archery contests. Other annual activities include a weekend-long live action Assassin-style game themed after the series' Faceless Men characters, a board game tournament, and a \\"Flea Bottom Fete\\" dance party, among others. A mock election has been held each year since 2013 allowing attendees to campaign for and vote for characters from A Song of Ice and Fire. A donation-based voting format was incorporated beginning in 2017, with all proceeds going to Santa Fe's Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary, a favorite charity of Martin. Awards and honors In 2016, FanSided named Ice and Fire Con as one of the top ten nerdiest vacation destinations. In 2017, NowThis News praised Ice and Fire Con in its \\"Game of Thrones - A Community of Ice and Fire\\" coverage for the event's \\"more intimate gathering that's more party than press conference\\", favorably comparing the Ice and Fire Con to the fan conventions Martin himself attended in the 1970s and 1980s as a fan and built the friendships that served him throughout his career. Westeros.org Linda Antonsson, Elio M. Garc√≠a and George R.R. Martin in 2015. Sweden-based fans Elio M. Garc√≠a Jr. and Linda Antonsson run one of the main Ice and Fire fansites, Westeros.org, which they established in 1999. The site had about 17 thousand registered members in 2012. Martin himself has checked with Garc√≠a (whom The New Yorker dubbed a \\"superfan\\" with encyclopedic knowledge of Martin's works) to confirm details of his own series, and has referred HBO researchers to Garc√≠a as well. The very first fan website and messageboard (as recounted by Garc√≠a, Antonsson, and Martin) was a site called \\"Dragonstone\\", which only lasted for about one year between the release of the first novel in 1996, and the site crashed in 1997, never to be rebuilt. The creator of \\"Dragonstone\\" moved on; however, several of the earliest online fans who had met on the site (Elio Garc√≠a among them) coalesced again to create Westeros.org.History of the Board, Westeros.org, posted February 2008. Though his work at Westeros.org is voluntary, Garc√≠a has been a paid consultant for licensed tie-in merchandise. Garc√≠a and Antonsson are Martin's coauthors of a companion book to the series, The World of Ice & Fire (2014). Martin had approached the pair about the project in 2008. Brotherhood Without Banners The Brotherhood Without Banners is an unofficial fan club operating globally. George R. R. Martin attends their gatherings on his travels and counts their founders and other longtime members among his good friends. Game of Thrones Since the creation of the television series in 2011 there has been a proliferation in the number of fansites dedicated to the show and novel series. These include 'WatchersOnTheWall.com' which provides news reports, reviews and discussion forums, 'ToweroftheHand.com', which organizes communal readings of the novels, and 'Fleabottom.net', an online discussion forum. In addition to these there is further discussion on more general sites, such as Reddit, and tumblr, where there are many fan-created blogs. Moreover, there are also many podcasts covering the series. These podcasts, such as 'Game of Owns', and 'A Podcast of Ice and Fire' provide discussions of each book chapters, and each episode in the television series, as well as discussing the current theories in the fandom. GRRuMblers While Martin calls the majority of his fans \\"great\\", and enjoys interacting with them, some of them turned against him due to the six years it took to release A Dance with Dragons. A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as Finish the Book, George and Is Winter Coming?. It is not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either. The New Yorker called this \\"an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion.\\" When fans' vocal impatience for A Dance with Dragons peaked in 2009, Martin issued an angry statement called \\"To My Detractors\\" on his blog to stem a rising tide of anger. Author Neil Gaiman backed Martin on his own blog, replying to a fan's inquiry about Martin's tardiness that \\"George R. R. Martin is not your bitch.\\" Martin sees it a right to withdraw anytime and enjoy his leisure times as he chooses. Martin believes of himself as being bound by an informal contract with his readers; he feels that he owes them his best work. He does not, however, believe that this gives them the right to dictate the particulars of his creative process or to complain about how he manages his time. As far as the detractors are concerned, Martin's contract with them was for a story, their engagement with it offered on the understanding that he would provide them with a satisfying conclusion. Interaction with the author Martin is committed to nurturing his audience, no matter how vast it gets. Starting out as a fan himself, he visited his first convention in 1971 after selling his first story. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, Martin tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends, such as the Brotherhood Without Banners. His fan mail occasionally includes photos of children and pets named after his characters, which Martin displays on his website. He also administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck. Martin does not read message boards anymore, so as not influence his writing by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from how he intended. Celebrity fans The series has a devoted global following of people from a range of backgrounds. Celebrity fans include former U.S. president Barack Obama, former UK prime minister David Cameron, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics in quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech. Other fans includes singer Zara Larsson, Adam Lambert, and Scott Ian from the metal band Anthrax, with the later one having read books, stated that he likes the show better, saying that it's very rarely that a TV show or a movie is better than the source material. Other celebrity fans include actors Laurence Fishburne, Richard Dreyfuss, June Squibb, Amanda Peet, Zach Braff, Patton Oswalt, Elijah Wood, Mindy Kaling, Dax Shepard, Kristen Bell, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick, Kerry Washington, Dylan McDermott and Jennifer Lawrence. Singers T-Pain, Kelly Clarkson, Snoop Dogg, Ed Sheeran, Madonna and Joe Jonas (who is married to Sophie Turner, who played Sansa Stark on the show), and comedians Kevin Smith, Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari. Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively are also both fans of the show. Author Stephen King is also a fan of the series. Jay-Z and Beyonc√© are both fans of the show, while Jay-Z once bought dragon eggs for his wife Beyonc√©. In 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also said that they watch the show.

Tuberculosis in India is a major health problem causing about 220,000 deaths every year. The cost of the death and disease in the Indian economy between 2006 and 2014 was approximately USD 1 billion. Despite the historical challenges, the technology and health care for treating tuberculosis have improved. In 2020 the Indian government made bold statements to eliminate TB from the country by 2025 through its National TB Elimination Program. Interventions in this program include major investment in health care, providing supplemental nutrition credit through the Nikshay Poshan Yojana, organizing a national epidemiological survey for tuberculosis, and organizing a national campaign to tie together the Indian government and private health infrastructure for the goal of eliminating TB. India bears a disproportionately large burden of the world's tuberculosis rates, as it continues to be the biggest health problem in India. India is the highest TB burden country with World Health Organization (WHO) statistics for 2011 giving an estimated incidence figure of 2.2 million cases of TB for India out of a global incidence of 9.6 million cases.TB Statistics for India. (2012). TB Facts. Retrieved April 3, 2013, from http://www.tbfacts.org/tb-statistics- india.html Tuberculosis is India's biggest health issue, but what makes this issue worse is the recently discovered phenomenon of TDR-TB - Totally Drug- Resistant Tuberculosis. This issue of drug-resistant TB began with MDR-TB, and moved on to XDR-TB. Gradually, the most dangerous form has situated itself in India as TDR-TB. Epidemiology Children have special needs both in preventing and treating tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is one of India's major public health problems. According to WHO estimates, India has the world's largest tuberculosis epidemic.WHO. Global tuberculosis control. WHO report. WHO/HTM/TB/2006.362. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2006. Many research studies have shown the effects and concerns revolving around TDR-TB, especially in India; where social and economic positions are still in progression. In Zarir Udwadia‚Äôs report originated from the Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai, India explicitly discusses the drug-resistant effects and results. An experiment was conducted in January, 2012 on four patients to test how accurate the ‚Äúnew category‚Äù of TDR-TB is. These patients were given all the first-line drugs and second-line drugs that usually are prescribed to treat TB, and as a result, were resistant to all. As a response, the government of India had stayed in denial, but WHO took it as a more serious matter and decided that although the patterns of drug-resistance were evident, they cannot rely on just that to create a new category of TDR-TB. Compared to India, Canada has about 1,600 new cases of TB every year.Tuberculosis - Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis. (2013). C-Health. Retrieved April 3, 2103, from http://chealth.canoe.ca/channel_condition_info_details.asp?disease_id=231&channel;_id=1020&relation;_id=71085 Citing studies of TB-drug sales, the government now suggests the total went from being 2.2 million to 2.6 million people nationwide. On March 24, 2019, TB Day, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of India notified that 2.15 million new tuberculosis patients has discovered only in 2018. In India, TB is responsible for the death of every third AIDS patient. moreover, India accounts for about a quarter of the Global TB Burden. The ministry reiterated their commitment to eliminating TB in the country by 2025. As part of its efforts to eliminate Tuberculosis, the Union government changed the name of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) to National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) on December 30,2019. Symptoms The bacterium that causes TB is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Inactive tuberculosis means that one can even unconsciously and unknowingly acquire the bacteria for tuberculosis within them but not even know about it because it is inactive. Whereas, active tuberculosis is the start of the bacteria developing, and the signs and symptoms begin to be visible. This is when tuberculosis is active within you, and is a serious issue leading to even more serious results. Although the TB bacteria can infect any organ (e.g., kidney, lymph nodes, bones, joints) in the body, the disease commonly occurs in the lungs. Around 80% of all TB cases are related to pulmonary or lung. Common symptoms include: coughing (that lasts longer than 3 weeks with green, yellow, or bloody sputum), weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. Causes Scanning electron micrograph of Mycobacterium tuberculosis There is a specific bacterium that evolves inside the body to result in tuberculosis, known as mycobacterium tuberculosis. This bacterium is only spread throughout the body when a person has an active TB infection. One of many causes of acquiring TB is living a life with a weak immune system; everything becomes fragile, and an easy target. That is why babies, children, and senior adults have a higher risk of adapting TB. The bacterium spreads in the air sacs, and passes off into the lungs, resulting in an infected immune system. In addition, coughing, sneezing, and even talking to someone can release the mycobacterium into the air, consequently affecting the people breathing this air. It has been stated that your chances of becoming infected are higher if you come from ‚Äì or travel to ‚Äì certain countries where TB is common, and where there is a big proportion of homeless people. India, having the most TB cases of any countrySachdeva, Kuldeep Singh et al. ‚ÄúNew vision for Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP): Universal access - \\"reaching the un-reached\\".‚Äù The Indian journal of medical research vol. 135,5 (2012): 690-4. falls under this cause because it stands recognized as consuming a higher chance of gaining TB.  Socioeconomic Dimensions of TB  Those listed are all the bodily and personal causes of acquiring TB, but decreases in tuberculosis in India incidence are correlated with improvements in social and economic determinants of health moreso than with access to quality treatment. In India, TB occurs at high rates because of the pollution dispersed throughout the country. Pollution causes many effects in the air the people breathe there, and since TB can be gained through air, the chances of TB remain high and in a consistent movement going uphill for India. Lack of infrastructure Another major cause for the growth of TB in India has to do with it currently still standing as a developing country. Because its economy is still developing, the citizens are still fighting for their rights, and the structure of the country lies in poor evidence that it is not fit as other countries still. A study of Delhi slums has correlated higher scores on the Human Development Index and high proportions of one-room dwellings tended to incur TB at higher rates. Poor built environments, including hazards in the workplace, poor ventilation, and overcrowded homes have also been found to increase exposure to TB Access to treatment TB rises high in India because of the majority of patients are not able to afford the treatment drugs prescribed. ‚ÄúAt present, only the 1.5 million patients already under the Indian government's care get free treatments for regular TB. That leaves patients who seek treatment in India's growing private sector to buy drugs for themselves, and most struggle to do that, government officials say.‚Äù Although the latest phase of state-run tuberculosis eradication program, the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, has focused on increasing access to TB care for poor people, the majority of poor people still cannot access TB care financially. Consequently, high priced treatment drugs and the struggles of ‚Äúpoor patients‚Äù also brawl through the poor treatment they receive in response to acquiring TB. ‚ÄúIt is estimated that just 16% of patients with drug- resistant TB are receiving appropriate treatment‚Äù. To combat this huge problem, India has instated a new program to try to provide free drugs to all those infected in the country. While RNTCP has created schemes to offer free or subsidized, high quality TB care, less than 1% of private practitioners have taken up these practices. Lastly, as high pricing is linked to the economic standings of India, which is linked to poor treatment, it all underlines the lack of education and background information practitioners and professionals hold for prescribing drugs, or those private therapy sessions. A study conducted in Mumbai by Udwadia, Amale, Ajbani, and Rodrigues, showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. Because the majority of TB cases are addressed by private providers, and because the majority of poor people access informal (private) providers, the RNTCP's goals for universal access to TB care have not been met. Poor health Poverty and lacking financial resources are also associated with malnutrition, poor housing conditions, substance use, and HIV/AIDS incidence. These factors often cause immunosuppression, and are accordingly correlated with higher susceptibility to TB; they also tend to have greater impacts on people from high incidence countries such as India than lower incidence countries. Indeed, addressing these factors may have a stronger correlation with decreased TB incidence than the decreasing financial burdens associated with care. Yet, the RNTCP's treatment protocols do not address these social determinants of health. Treatment Treatment in India is on the rise just as the disease itself is on the rise. To prevent spreading TB, it's important to get treatment quickly and to follow it through to completion by your doctor. This can stop transmission of the bacteria and the appearance of antibiotic-resistant strains. It is a known fact that bacterial infections require antibiotics for treatment and prevention, thus, commonly you will see that patients diagnosed with tuberculosis have certain pills and antibiotics carried around with them. The antibiotics most commonly used include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. It is crucial to take your medication as instructed by your doctor, and for the full course of the treatment (months or years). This helps to ward off types of TB bacteria that are antibiotic-resistant, which take longer and are more difficult to treat. In India‚Äôs case, the particular type of TB infections are majority resistant to regular antibiotic treatment (MDR-TB, XDR-TB, TDR-TB), therefore, not one or two medications will help, rather a combination of different medications must be taken for over a course of 18‚Äì24 months, depending on how deep the infection is. Since the 1960s, two drugs ‚Äî isoniazid and rifampicin ‚Äî have been the standard TB treatment. In addition to antibiotics, a vaccine is available to limit the spread of bacteria after TB infection. The vaccine is generally used in countries or communities where the risk of TB infection is greater than 1% each year, thus, the country of India; whose TB infection rate is at a peak (world‚Äôs third highest TB infected country), and is consistently growing, and giving 20% of the world‚Äôs diagnosed patients a home. At present the anti TB treatment offered in public and private sector in India is not satisfactory and needs to be improved.Mishra G, Mulani J. Tuberculosis Prescription Practices In Private And Public Sector In India. NJIRM. 2013; 4(2): 71-78.Available online at http://www.scopemed.org/?mno=36915. Accessed on 6/5/2013. Today India's TB control program needs to update itself with the international TB guidelines as well as provide an optimal anti TB treatment to the patients enrolled under it or it will land up being another factor in the genesis of drug-resistant tuberculosis. History India's response to TB has changed with time and technology. One way to divide responses to TB are the activities from the time before modern medicine, then from modern medicine to Independence, then the developments after Independence. Before modern medicine India used traditional medicine to treat TB until the availability of modern medicine including antibiotics and X-rays. In 600 BCE the ancient text Sushruta Samhita described tuberculosis. In 1906 India established its first sanatorium for treating TB in Ajmer. In 1916 Bombay established the first TB medical dispensary. After Independence After Independence the Indian government established various regional and national TB reduction programmes. Global participation The contemporary response to TB includes India's participation and leadership in global TB reduction and elimination programs. The Indian government‚Äôs Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) started in India during 1997. The program uses the WHO- recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) strategy to develop ideas and data on TB treatment. This group‚Äôs initial objective is to achieve and maintain a TB treatment success rate of at least 85% in India among new patients.http://www.scidev.net/tb/facts ‚ÄúIn 2010 the RNTCP made a major policy decision that it would change focus and adopt the concept of Universal Access to quality diagnosis and TB treatment for all TB patients‚Äù. By doing so, they extend out a helping hand to all people diagnosed with TB, and in addition, provide better quality services and improve on therapy for these patients. Treatment recommendations from Udwadia, et al. suggest that patients with TDR-TB only be treated ‚Äúwithin the confines of government- sanctioned DOTS-Plus Programs to prevent the emergence of this untreatable form of tuberculosis‚Äù. As this confirming result of hypothesis is at a conclusion by Udawadai, et al., it is given that the new Indian government program will insist on providing drugs free of charge to TB patients of India, for the first time ever. Society and culture=Organizations The Tuberculosis Association of India is a voluntary organization. It was set up in February 1939. It is also affiliated to the Govt. of India & is working with TB Delhi center. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) has established a network of laboratories where TB tests can be done to diagnose people who have TB. There are also tests that can be done to determine whether a person has drug-resistant TB. The laboratory system comprises National Reference Laboratories (NRLs), state level Intermediate Reference Laboratories (IRLs), Culture & Drug Susceptibility Testing (C & DST) laboratories and Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs). Some of Private lab also Accredited for Culture & Drug Susceptibility Testing for M.tuberculosis (i.e Microcare Laboratory & tuberculosis Research Centre, Surat) Stigma Disempowerment and stigma are often felt by TB patients as they are disproportionately impoverished or socially marginalized. The DOTS treatment regimen of the RNTCP is thought to deepen this sentiment, as its close monitoring of patients can decrease patient autonomy. To counteract disempowerment, some countries have engaged patients in the process of implementing the DOTS and in creating other treatment regimens that adhere to their nonclinical needs. Their knowledge can inform valuable complements the clinical care provided by the DOTS. Pro-poor strategies, including wage compensation for time lost to treatment, working with civil society organizations to link low income patients to social services, nutritional support, and offering local NGOs and committees a platform for engagement with the work done by private providers may reduce the burden of TB and leads to greater patient autonomy. Economics Some legal advocates have argued that public interest litigation in India must be part of the TB response strategy to ensure that available resources actually fund the necessary health response. India has a large burden of the world's TB, with an estimated economic loss of US $43 billion and 100 million lost annually directly due to this disease. Special populations The most certain knowledge about how Scheduled Tribes and other Adivasi] experience TB is that there is a lack of research and understanding of the health of this demographic. There is recognition that this community is more vulnerable and has less access to treatment, but details are lacking on how TB affects tribal communities.

The admission of China to the WTO was preceded by a lengthy process of negotiations and required significant changes to the Chinese economy.  Background  Until the 1970s, China‚Äôs economy was managed by the communist government and was kept closed from other economies. Together with political reforms, China in the early 1980s began to open its economy and signed a number of regional trade agreements. China gained observer status with GATT and from 1986, began working towards joining that organization. China aimed to be included as a WTO founding member (which would validate it as a world economic power) but this attempt was thwarted because the United States, European countries, and Japan requested that China first reform various tariff policies, including tariff reductions, open markets and industrial policies.  Preparations  After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, China sold off or merged many unprofitable state- owned enterprises. In 1998, China reformed the State Council to greatly reduce the mandate of the State Planning Commission and increase the mandate of the State Economic and Trade Commission. This shift also corresponded to the change in premiership from Li Peng to Zhu Rongji, the latter of whom strongly believed that China needed deeper economic restructuring. This restructuring, which had been happening since the 1980s, included crackdowns on corruption and the establishment of chambers of commerce.  United States' role  Formal diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China were not established until 1979, and even afterwards, trade relations were hampered by the high tariff rates of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act of 1930. After the two governments settled asset claims dating from the Korean War in 1950, Congress temporarily granted China most favored nation status in 1980. However, Chinese-American trade was still hindered by the Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment of 1974, which made trade with the United States contingent on certain human rights metrics. The Jackson‚ÄìVanik restrictions could not apply, however, to WTO members, because of WTO rules that prohibit this kind of discrimination. By 1984, the United States had become China's third-largest trading partner, and China became America's 14th largest. However, the annual renewal of China's MFN status was constantly challenged by anti-Chinese pressure groups during US congressional hearings. For example, U.S. imports from China almost doubled within five years from $51.5 billion in 1996 to $102 billion in 2001. The American textile industry lobbied Congress for, and received, tariffs on Chinese textiles according to the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In reaction to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests' suppression, the Bush I administration and Congress imposed administrative and legal constraints on investment, exports, and other trade relations with China. The Clinton presidency from 1992 started with an executive order (128590) that linked renewal of China's MFN status with seven human rights conditions, including \\"preservation of Tibetan indigenous religion and culture\\" and \\"access to prisons for international human rights organizations\\" --Clinton reversed this position a year later. Other challenges to Sino- American relations in this decade included the Cox Committee investigations against supposed nonprofit involvement in \\"promoting communism\\", the persecution of Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee for unproven allegations of espionage for the PRC, and the 1999 United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. But relations warmed after the September 2001 initiation by George W. Bush of the War on Terror. Conditions These changes were difficult steps for China and conflicted with its prior economic strategy. Accession meant that China would engage in global competition according to rules that it did not make. China's admission was \\"an enormous multilateral achievement\\" that marked a clear commitment towards multilateralism. When China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries. After China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), its service sector was considerably liberalized and foreign investment was allowed; its restrictions on retail, wholesale and distribution ended. Banking, financial services, insurance and telecommunications in China were also opened up to foreign investment. Furthermore, China had to deal with certain concerns linked to transparency and intellectual property that the accession to WTO underlined.

Life story of Heitor Amorim ‚ÄòAfter the Flowers, the Stones‚Äô‚ÄîOn the Soccer Field LIKE most Brazilian boys, I grew up playing soccer on any vacant lot or street. Soccer stars of the day were our idols. To become a professional player was our ultimate desire. So at the age of 13, when we moved to Rio de Janeiro to live in a house near the S√£o Crist√≥v√£o Stadium, I was ‚Äòdeliriously happy.‚Äô Within a few years I began to show some promise on the front line of our team. But then in 1958, just before an important game, we lost our goalkeeper. ‚ÄúHeitor Amorim, you are the tallest,‚Äù said our trainer. ‚ÄúYou are going to be our goalie.‚Äù So began my career as the one player under the crossbar, the player who should never fail. Time flew as I divided my waking hours between school and training on the soccer field. In 1963 I was thrilled to be chosen to play on the Brazilian Olympic team. We won the Pan-American tournament in S√£o Paulo that year. This paved the way for an invitation to play on the famous S√£o Paulo Corinthians team and I did not think twice before accepting the offer. So, leaving my job and the engineering school, I moved to S√£o Paulo to give my undivided attention to professional soccer. Aiming High My new career soon began to pay dividends. Within months I was nominated the goalie ‚Äúfind‚Äù of the year and, soon thereafter, trophies began to come my way, one as the best goalkeeper and the other as the least vulnerable goalie for 1964. Besides gifts, I received invitations to appear on TV sports programs. My home was filled with fans and reporters, my evenings with social life, and money was flowing into my bank account. A New Idol Appears I will never forget a game we played against the Santos team in the Pacaembu Stadium of S√£o Paulo. We were well into the second half and the score was tied. Our placing in the finals of the tournament depended on the outcome of this game. Then, horrors! We were penalized, giving our opponents a direct kick in front of my goal. This kick would practically decide the game, and who was chosen to make the kick? Pel√©, the world-famous ‚Äúking of soccer‚Äù! The 60,000 spectators and millions of radio listeners held their breath as we faced each other. As I watched Pel√© I recalled how he would make an almost imperceptible pause just before kicking the ball in an attempt to trick the goalie to jump to the side of the net opposite from where he planned to kick it. So I remained motionless and jumped only after he kicked the ball‚Äîand I caught it! Pandemonium broke loose. All over the city thousands of radio fans rushed into the streets to shoot off fireworks and ‚Äúbombs.‚Äù The game ended in a tie and I was carried off the field on the shoulders of the fans. A new star was born! Amid all the euphoria that followed I remembered the wise words of the experienced Gilmar, goalkeeper for the all-star team, who said to me on a radio program: ‚ÄúHeitor, do not be deceived. The flowers of today can be the stones of tomorrow!‚Äù Time for Reflection Amid all this fame it was hard to imagine that there could be any ‚Äústones of tomorrow.‚Äù However, my marriage to Dilma in 1965 helped me to keep my balance and think more clearly about our future. My career was indeed important to us‚Äînot the glory and fame, but, rather, the economic security that it could give. With this we could enjoy peace and quiet in which to raise our children and in which we could work on behalf of others. I often thought of my honest, hardworking father who really outdid himself giving me gifts as a child. But at the same time he taught us to have a deep concern for others. Was I doing what he would have done? Then, too, the world situation was worsening. ‚ÄúWill there never be real peace?‚Äù Dilma would ask. With my Roman Catholic background, I realized that I should be doing more about my religion. An international tour in 1965-66 did not help matters. England, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, the United States‚Äîgames with some of the best teams in the world. In London we received from Prince Philip a silver disk as a souvenir of the game played against Arsenal in Wembley Stadium. And in the newspapers there was my name alongside that of other stars‚ÄîRivelino, Garrinha‚Äîas attractions for the games. It was all very heady‚Äîand also very disturbing. Mysticism in Soccer Especially disturbing to me was a feature of soccer that is almost unknown and perhaps hard to believe. Behind the scenes in Brazil soccer is saturated with superstitions, and even spiritistic practices. For example, during the last World Cup, in Argentina in 1978, candles and other voodoo objects were placed in some soccer fields in Brazil as an aid to their team to win. But the team lost. Jokingly, it has been said, ‚ÄúIf Macumba [voodoo rites] really had power, the soccer tournaments in the State of Bahia would always end in a tie,‚Äù because of the large number of rites performed on behalf of each team. I remember that the Corinthians had a pai-de-santo (voodoo priest) hired for that purpose. Sometimes all of us players would be called to the club at midnight for a special herb bath prescribed by him. On one occasion our club was doing badly in a tournament and the pai-de-santo decided that someone had performed witchcraft against us and he would have to undo it. So one Friday at midnight all players and some newsmen went with him to the stadium. He began to dig and, to our surprise, he dug up seven daggers that had been buried there, one on each corner of the field, one behind each goal and one in the middle of the field. All the daggers were alike and each had seven undulations in the handle. Here, apparently, was the reason for our losses! Some players were deeply impressed, others doubtful. Nevertheless, we lost the tournament and the pai-de-santo was fired! Later on he was hired by another team and I remember how on one occasion he put a curse on us as we entered the stadium. But we won! And the daggers? I found out later that the club caretaker had told the pai-de-santo that the daggers had been planted there by a previous pai-de-santo to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù our team win. So he knew where to dig them up! Deceptions and Even ‚ÄúStones‚Äù Further deceptions followed after our return from the international tour. A tournament between Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo was arranged, and from the teams in this contest were generally chosen the all-star team. Although described in the newspapers as the best goalie, I was not chosen, apparently because of problems involving our team. It was a bitter pill to swallow. Then, too, I became involved in a battle for labor rights for soccer players and this led to differences with the club ownership. Finally, matters came to a climax. My wife was taken to a hospital for medical attention while I had to play a game. Mentally upset, I played badly and we lost to a technically inferior team. I was blamed for the loss, even accused of having accepted a bribe. Although one newspaper declared that I was a ‚Äúvictim of human malice,‚Äù I was not even allowed to enter some of the club buildings. My friends and neighbors looked at me suspiciously. What a change! Sunday an idol and Monday unwanted! Gilmar was right: ‚ÄòFlowers today, stones tomorrow.‚Äô I became so depressed that for several days I did not even want to go outside. Shortly thereafter I was transferred for a year to a team in Paran√°. A Timely Visit One Sunday morning while I was away at the club an elderly man called at our home and, after a few introductory remarks, asked my wife: ‚ÄúDid you know that the Bible says that soon there will be no more war? Wouldn‚Äôt you enjoy living forever in peace on this earth?‚Äù Then, to prove his point, he asked her to read in the Bible the text at Psalm 46:8, 9, which says: ‚ÄúCome, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces.‚Äù Well, this was good news to my wife! So began a series of weekly visits to our home by one of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. Although I personally was not particularly interested in a Bible study, I did not object to the visits. Occasionally I would ask a question and invariably would receive a satisfactory answer from the Bible itself. Then something sparked my interest. My wife, knowing that I had been taught since childhood to have deep concern and respect for the elderly, artfully suggested that I read an article entitled ‚ÄúThe Pleasure of Listening to Grandparents,‚Äù in Awake! of July 8, 1968. The fine article encouraged me to read more and soon I joined my wife in Bible study. A New Outlook on Life A few months later we were invited to attend a convention of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses in the Pacaembu Stadium, the very place where I had been carried out of the stadium on the shoulders of soccer fans. Vivid scenes flashed through my mind as I tried to concentrate on the fine Bible counsel being presented. As the days passed at the assembly I could not help but see contrasts. No jostling or jeering, no flag waving or hero worship. The quiet orderliness of the crowd, the loving consideration shown to one another and especially to us newer ones, the warm hugs and the happy greetings of ‚ÄúBrother‚Äù or ‚ÄúSister,‚Äù all made a deep impression on my wife and me. A natural follow-up to the assembly was an invitation for us to accompany the Witnesses in their door-to-door preaching work. On many occasions I would be recognized by the householder, and it was interesting to observe their frank amazement. They were not used to having a soccer star call on them to talk about the Bible! As time went on, we found that we were gradually adopting a new outlook on life, with a new sense of values and, above all, a new hope for the future. True security, we learned, would not come from a good salary or a fine home but only from putting first the interests of God‚Äôs kingdom. ‚ÄúKeep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you,‚Äù Jesus had declared in the Sermon on the Mount. (Matt. 6:33) My conscience began to tell me that the fierce competition manifest in the soccer games, the strong rivalries, yes, even hatreds, and the spiritistic practices, all were contrary to Bible teachings. Finally, much as I loved to play soccer, I decided to end my career as a professional and to accept a job in Rio de Janeiro at a much lower income level. Then on December 18, 1970, my wife and I were baptized, by immersion in water, in symbol of our dedication to serve Jehovah. Since then, what fine privileges we have enjoyed! We have been able to help several of our relatives to a knowledge of the Bible promise of living forever in a future earthly paradise. We enjoy a sense of security that only this knowledge can bring. I still enjoy a friendly game of soccer, but gone are the ‚Äúflowers‚Äù and the ‚Äústones.‚Äù Now our days are fuller and more meaningful because of the knowledge of the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù that has enriched our lives. https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/101981372#h=1:0-42:59 References 1940 births Living people Brazilian footballers Association football goalkeepers Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Pan American Games medalists in football Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil Footballers at the 1963 Pan American Games ","title":"Heitor Amorim Perroca"},{"id":"36015368","text":"is a 1953 Japanese drama film written and directed by Kaneto Shindo.

Its parish falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra, and serves the parishioners of the northern coast from the border with Sal√£o to Ribeira Funda. History The main facade of the church and courtyard from Rua da Igreja, showing its mix of modern and historical elementsThe first reference to the church dates to 1594, by Faialense historian Silveira Macedo, who referred to its construction. A lateral inscription over the south portico identifies the date that the lateral chapel was constructed as 1596. But writer Marcelino Lima suggested that its foundation may have been earlier, quoting Gaspar Frutuoso. During the third quarter of the 16th century, Gaspar Frutuoso writing in his epic chronicle \\"Saudades da Terra\\", described the church as a three nave temple, with five columns, one to the left of the entrance. On 20 November 1971, there was a large fire that destroyed the main nave and lateral chapels. Its reconstruction resulted in an expansion of the space and modernization of the design, but the reinauguration of the temple only occurred in 1977. Following the 1998 earthquake, the church was damaged, resulting in new renovations. In October 1999, Helder Manuel de Oliveira, a resident of Castelo Branco, was informed by his sister (who lived in Ribeira Funda) that Father Jo√£o Antonio Neves (a natural of Prainha, municipality of S√£o Roque), who was parish priest of Castelo Branco, but had become the new parish priest in Cedros, had discovered at the end of September or beginning of October, in the parochial residence, an image of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio (Our Lady of the Rosary), which he found under a staircase in a hole. Helder's cousin had informed him that the priest had mentioned that the image was 300 years old, believing it to have been created in the 17th or early 18th century, and which coincided with the death registries that referred to the chapels of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios and Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio (which were part of the old Church of Santa B√°rbara). Since it was custom at the time to have an image of its patron saint in the chapel, and since an image of Our Lady of the Rosary had disappeared, he assumed that the image was that of the original saint, hidden by the then parish priest. Architecture The interior of the modernized church, showing the open concept nave and lattice ceiling The ornate walls in azulejo tile that comprise the lateral baptismal font space The church is situated in the locality of Pra√ßa, the main agglomeration in the parish, on a rise, accessible from Rua da Igreja. It is fronted by the Museu Etnogr√°fico dos Cedros (Ethnographic Museum of Cedros), instituted by the local Casa do Povo (social centre) to the west and churchyard. Originally designed on a five nave longitudinal plan, the current model is a simplification and modernization from the first design, with main space, and lateral spaces for sacristy, baptismal font and lateral pius. The design has taken on an eclectic design mixing modernist trends, Manueline elements and Baroque motifs. In the lateral Over the southern lateral doorway is an inscription stating: \\"Esta capela fez Ant√≥nio Martins em 1596\\". The main portal is worked/sculpted basalt, in Roman arch, with three archivolts separated by decorated pilasters. The exterior archivolt is flanked by sculpted pilasters, which extend above each respective capital and end in a floral. The two-storey rectangular bell-tower includes footers, cornerstones, frames, corners and pinnacles in masonry. The rest of the surface is plastered and painted in white. Dividing each floor are cornices: on the first floor is a rectangular window and the second floor includes four Roman arches with the tower bells.

It was released on November 2012 in North America, Australia and Europe. Initially announced by Ubisoft a few weeks before E3 2012, it is the first handheld- exclusive Rabbids game. Gameplay Rabbids Rumble centers around battling within 7 differently-themed worlds, in which the player's party and the current foe's party take turns attacking each other until only one side has health remaining. When a rabbid loses in battle, a new party member takes their place until there are no more fighters left on one side. It features 102 playable Rabbids, who are earned by playing the different modes; StreetPass; or the packaged AR card,http://rabbids.ubi.com/bwaaah/en- US/games/nintendo_3ds/rabbids_rumble/index.aspx each with their own simple moveset. As the box art shows, these Rabbids include a professional wrestler, a football player, a superhero, a dragon, a Spartan, and an astronaut, among others. The game contains various mini-games, alongside the main fighting mode. StreetPass can be used to battle friends. AR Cards and QR Codes are both located online for downloading. There are 5 QR Codes containing a different Rabbids character each. Development Rabbids Rumble's development began in London some time before late May 2012. By late May, a name, box art, and screenshots of the game were released publicly even though E3 2012 was still a month away. It was decided early on in development that the game would have a slapstick humor theme. Rabbid Rumble was being developed at the same time as the Rabbids Invasion television show, meaning Nick and Ubisoft planned for the game to, among other things, keep the Rabbids brand fresh in the minds of consumers in time for the show's airing. Strong similarities between this game and the show can be found in the heavy usage of slapstick humor and the distinct 3D animation style. Reception After its release, Rabbids Rumble received mixed reviews. IGN, among other household-name game reviewer companies, such as Game Informer, never reviewed Rabbids Rumble, which is uncommon for a Rabbids game published by Ubisoft. Despite that, Adam Riley of Cubed3 gave the game a high 7 out of 10 stars, and said the mini-game portions of the game were a \\"healthy\\" addition. He also said the game overall was a \\"very enjoyable experience,\\" but claimed the Pok√©mon-like gameplay was \\"nowhere near as deep [as the game series it's mimicking].\\" Metacritic's review average is more critical of the game, being a low 59/100.

It was established in August 1940 at Western Junction Aerodrome, Tasmania, and provided introductory flying training to new RAAF pilots. Training activities ceased in December 1944, and the unit was disbanded in August the next year. History As part of Australia's commitment to the Empire Air Training Scheme, the RAAF established twelve elementary flying training schools in 1940 and 1941.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 15‚Äì35 The role of these units was to provide a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages; the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying), which were used to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including 65 hours of flying) at the elementary training school. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to a service flying training school in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.Stephens (2006), pp. 68‚Äì70 No. 7 Elementary Flying Training School (No. 7 EFTS) was established at Western Junction Aerodrome (the modern Launceston Airport) on 29 August 1940.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 25 This aerodrome pre-dated the war, and had been used by the Tasmanian Aero Club. To make way for the flying school the club moved its aircraft and other equipment to Cambridge Aerodrome near Hobart. While the flying club expected to be incorporated into the RAAF's training effort, this did not eventuate. As a result, No. 7 EFTS was the only RAAF aircrew training unit to be located in Tasmania during the war.Gillison (1962), p. 111 The flying school's initial complement arrived throughout in August, and were billeted at nearby Launceston, until work to construct facilities at Western Junction was completed. A satellite airfield was also eventually built at Nile, from Western Junction Aerodrome. No. 7 EFTS's first eleven Tiger Moth trainers arrived on 11 September 1940, and flight training began nine days later. The unit was initially organised as a half-strength elementary flying school, and comprised two flights. The flights operated 18 Tiger Moths, and several others were held in reserve. On 31 May 1941 two No. 7 EFTS Tiger Moths collided as they were taking off. The pilot of one of the two aircraft was killed, and his passenger was injured. Several other more minor accidents also took place. By the end of October 1944, No. 7 EFTS was equipped with approximately 60 Tiger Moths, and had trained 1801 pilots. While No. 7 EFTS was the only flying unit stationed at Western Junction, the aerodrome was often visited by Airspeed Oxfords piloted by aircrew undergoing training at the Bairnsdale-based No. 1 Operational Training Unit. No. 67 Squadron aircraft also passed through the aerodrome during anti-submarine patrols of the Bass Strait area; this unit was headquartered at Laverton in Victoria. No. 7 EFTS' efforts were reduced as the war came to an end. Training was suspended in December 1944, and all flying ceased on 28 March the next year. The school was disbanded on 31 August 1945.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 26 Many of the Tiger Moths previously used by No. 7 EFTS were sold after the war, and three hangars constructed for the RAAF at Western Junction were donated to the Tasmanian Aero Club.

Shortly thereafter, Guilford was employed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, charged with surveying the route of the canal which ran from Clark's Ferry on the Susquehanna River to Northumberland.

Listing on the National Register of Historic Places PHMC historic preservation specialist Diane Reed was the individual who prepared the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for this district; she submitted it to the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior on March 21, 1991. Note: This includes The Swatara Furnace Historic District was then officially added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 1992. At the time the register listing was announced, newspapers also reported that members of the Pine Grove Historical Society and Pennsylvania Game Commission were working together \\"to reopen the park and maintain the furnace\\" as part of regional preservation efforts to preserve the historic structures located along Mill Creek.\\"Swatara Furnace Makes List in Register.\\" Pottsville, Pennsylvania: Pottsville Republican, July 30, 1992. Notable structures The four contributing buildings of the Swatara Furnace Historic District are located along both sides of Mill Creek, and include: the furnace (1830), stone dam breast (c. 1850), ironmaster's mansion (c. 1830, c. 1860, c. 1881, and c. 1969), barn (c. 1860), stone foreman's house (c. 1830), and stone worker's double house (c. 1830). The furnace, which was built in 1830 roughly 150 feet south of Mill Creek, was constructed of limestone, and measures 29 feet, 7 inches, wide, 29 feet, 8 inches, deep, and 22 feet high. Note: This includes The original section of the ironmaster's mansion, which was built circa 1830 (around the same time as the furnace), was a 2-1/2 story stone structure which was \\"two bays wide ‚Ä¶ with six over six windows.\\" The home's 3-1/2 story eastern section, which was subsequently added circa 1860, was \\"three bays wide, and four bays deep, forming an ell ‚Ä¶ with six over six windows and with shutters.\\" A frame construction which added 2-1/2 stories to the home's north side was likely built at roughly the same time (c. 1860), according to PHMC historic preservation specialist Diane Reed. Note: This includes The stone dam breast, which was described on the district planning committee's application for National Register placement as \\"one of the most unusual features of the historic district,\\" is a \\"stone battered-wall dam breast\\" which was built \\"to replace an earlier earthen dam which was apparently washed out during one of the periodic floods on the creek.\\" Mostly destroyed by a flood which occurred sometime around 1860, \\"a substantial portion of the dam breast still remains on the northwest bank of the creek.\\" Note: This includes The two non-contributing buildings in this district are a single pen, one- story log cabin, which was built circa 1933, and the water control house, a brick structure which was erected in 1960 and was still in use by the City of Lebanon's water department at the time of the district's 1991 placement on the National Register. Note: This includes Later changes to the property and existing structures The ironmaster's mansion was altered further, following the property's 1881 purchase by Mahlon Boyer, who wrapped a porch-veranda around the home's eastern, southern and western sides. The rear of the original 1830 building was then expanded in 1969 with the addition of a one- story laundry room with flat roof. By 1991 when planners were applying for historic district status with the National Register, the home was being operated as a bed and breakfast. Note: This includes In 2016, the Lebanon City Authority, Swatara State Parks, Pine Grove Historical Society, Friends of Memorial Lake, Oak Grove Sportsmen's Association, Old Forge Fishing Club, and Pennsylvania Game Commission joined together to launch a preservation initiative to protect and restore the historic Swatara Forge.Wheary, \\"Effort Underway to Restore Swatara Furnace, The Citizen-Standard.Terwilliger, Vicki. \\"Crews cut down sycamore to aid preservation of Swatara Furnace.\\" Pottsville, Pennsylvania: Republican-Herald, May 21, 2016.

Michael Kidner was one of its earliest and most consistent exponents and it was in these overlapping fields of optical effect and systemic structure that he was to find the creative substance that was to sustain his whole career. A Constructivist by inclination his interest in mathematics, chaos and wave theories informed an art that is both rational and intuitive. Without losing his rigorous, intellectual approach, Kidner manages to make his work resonate emotionally.Throughout his life he retained an interest in unpredictable world events that provoked unplanned elements within his work but he somehow managed to intimate an underlying order through his use of form and colour.  Early life  Kidner was born in Kettering, the son of an industrialist and was one of 6 children. He was educated at Bedales progressive school and in 1939 he went to Cambridge to read History and Anthropology, before studying Landscape Architecture at Ohio state university. He was staying with his older sister and her American husband in the USA when war broke out in Europe. Unable to return home he joined the Canadian army for 5 years. He was subsequently posted to England and after D Day saw active service in France in the Canadian Royal Corps of Signals. Post demobilisation in 1946, he enrolled at Goldsmiths University to study for a National Diploma in Art and Design. However he left after only 3 months as he was disenchanted with the course. From 1947 ‚Äì 50, Kidner taught at Pitlochry Prep school in Perthshire and it was here that he started to paint as a hobby. In 1949 he met and married his wife Marion Frederick an American actress. From 1951 to 1952 he became a theatre designer in Bromley and Barnstaple whilst continuing to paint. During a painting holiday in the south of France he met Andr√© Lhote who introduced him to Cubism and encouraged him to move to Paris and become a full-time painter. He travelled to Paris in 1953 where he attended Lhote's Atelier sporadically. After 2 years he returned to North Devon where his brother was practising as a GP. Here Kidner painted abstract landscapes rather in the spirit of the St Ives School. Subsequently he moved to St Ives for several months where he became acquainted with Trevor Bell, Roger Hilton, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron, Peter Lanyon and others in the group. On moving to London in 1957, Kidner was introduced to The New American Painting exhibition at the Tate Gallery where he saw the Abstract Expressionism of Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning. Somewhat later Kidner was particularly influenced by Mark Rothko's Colour field paintings. These inspired his After Image paintings, sculptures and reliefs, executed between 1957 and 1962. Another defining experience was a course in 1959 run by Victor Pasmore and Harry Thubron which alerted him to the Bauhaus derived ideas of colour. This led him towards a more objective use of colour that stimulated a new, radical approach to his painting. Kidner's first solo exhibition was held at St Hilda's college, Oxford in 1959 where he showed his After Image paintings. However it was not until 1965 that he became recognised as a pioneer of Op Art following the publicity surrounding the exhibition called The Responsive Eye organised by William Seitz at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Both Kidner and Bridget Riley's work were included. Kidner was to teach at numerous art schools, including Bath Academy of Art and Chelsea College of Art. In 1978 he was invited by the artist Stass Paraskos to be an artist-in-residence at the Cyprus College of Art arts centre in Paphos on the island of Cyprus.Michael Paraskos, et al, Stass Paraskos (London: Orage Press, 2010)  Mature career = After Image 1959  Kidner said that \\"Optics presents a challenge that was once offered by perspective\\".Sandler Irving. Michael Kidner \\"No Goals In Quicksand, \\" Exhibition Catalogue (Flowers East 2007), He was referring to the examination of visual perception in the science of linear perspective developed by Leon Battista Alberti and other Renaissance artists in the 15th century.Leon Battista Alberti, BookOne in On Painting. Translated by John Specer. Yale University Press, 1966. Kidner was also interested in the work of Seurat and the Neo Impressionists who had investigated the connection between the retina and the brain regarding colour perception, as seen in their Pointillist paintings.Felix Feneon, \\"Neo Impressionsim: Painting Expression and Colour\\" in Charles Harrison and Paul Woods (eds) \\"Art in Theory 1900‚Äì1990, An Anthology of Ideas\\" (Oxford Blackwell 1988) pp. 966‚Äì969 Rothko's Colour Field abstractions led Kidner to see colour as \\"pure sensation\\".*Sandler Irving 'Flowers Gallery East Exhibition Catalogue 2007, For example in his Moving Green 1959 the colours seem to float in an atmospheric colour relief in front of the canvas.On gazing at the colour field, the eye moves from the green to the red area and a bright, red spot or after image produced by the retina appears in the field. Later Kidner's After Image works became hard edged with flat uniform patterns, when he realised that optical activity producing shimmer is decreased by brushy paintwork and varied shapes. = Stripe 1961 = However After Image became too limited for Kidner, he found that he wanted to approach colour in a more rational way, so he began a series of striped paintings using two alternating colours. = Moire 1963 = By 1963, Kidner had recognised the limitation of 2 colours, the problem of how to introduce a third colour was solved for him in an article on the Moire effect in the Scientific American. This effect was first discovered in Japanese silks, when the material was folded, optical patterns and colours floated above the actual patterns and colour of the material. This method produced a dramatic effect when Kidner crossed 2 colour bands with a third at a slight angle, resulting in a completely new pattern, with a wave like vertical image hovering into view producing an intense optical dazzle.Sandler Irving, 'Michael Kidner. At Tension to the Wave, Exhibition Catalogue (Centre for International Arts, New York, 1990) = Wave 1969 = The appearance of the wave captivated Kidner and wave theory became his obsession as he realised that a wave pattern produces many more possibilities than straight lines because waves can be put in or out of phase. As well as optical effects he was interested in distinguishing form from colour. He applied 3 colours to 4 forms in rotation so that no form could be identified by a particular colour. This can be seen in his print Sussex 1967 Sussex 1967 = Columns = In 1969 the notion of colour as form urged Kidner on to do a columnar sculpture of a wave. At this stage he became interested in Number theory as the key to \\"the nature of order\\" and \\"the structure of reality\\". Kidner was influenced by Lohse, a pioneer of systems art who had written that \\"Through its relation to structure, technology, science etc (The ) task is to set up systems\\". Kidner meticulously translated the column into a two- dimensional form as a painting by using a systematic method of measurements and colour-coding as seen for example in: Column in front of its own image II 1971 = Grids and lattices 1973 and stretched elastic, 1987 = At this stage Kidner began to be interested in the spaces between the lines and crisscross wavy lines began to emerge in his work, culminating in grids and lattices. These were sometimes in phase creating identical spaces in between and then sometimes out of phase so the spaces in between didn't repeat. Kidner used this structure as a basis for creating many variations of this principle and observed that \\" the endless number of linear intersections both offer and resist any sort of visual resolution.\\" Continuing with his investigation of grids and lattices Kidner experimented with various materials. He stretched and distorted elastic cloth on moveable wooden frames in geometrical shapes, in order to arrive at unexpected shapes, thus introducing randomness, instability and change into his art. He felt that constructive art needed to take into account disorder as well as order. = Pentagon 1999 = By 1999, chaos theory became a profound influence on Kidner's work and geometric abstraction in the form of Penrose pentagons reprinted on paper became a critical tool as a metaphor for ordering the chaos in the world. This was Kidner's response to the many dystopian world events, such as global warming, wars, ethnic cleansing, terrorism and intense nationalism. Kidner was intrigued by the fact that his pentagon patterns looked chaotic, like whirlpools that appeared and receded as he viewed them. His use of colour in these works was often random and whereas in his former work, colour was used to clarify the grid, now it subverted it. He now invested more value in unplanned elements in his work of that time. He wondered if there may be in chaos \\"some kind of order that perhaps we haven't yet recognised.\\"Prof.Bann Stephen. Michael KidnerLove is a Virus from Outer Space Exhibition Catalogue (Flowers London, 2001). In his last decade Kidner's work became more colourful and free. Titles such as Entangled Hyacinth Bulbs, 2007, Invasion of Iraq: Surprise Resistance 2007 and Particle Evolution: The End of the Tunnel at Cern.2008 indicate their subject matter. Kidner's distinguished career has included many honours, prizes and international shows. He taught at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham from 1962 to 1982 and was visiting lecturer at The Slade School of Fine Art from 1975 ‚Äì 9 and Chelsea School of Art from 1981‚Äì85. He co‚Äìfounded the Systems Group with artist Jeffrey Steele and others in 1969. His work is in many important collections including those of Tate Britain, The Royal Academy, The British Arts Council, provincial galleries as well as in Portugal, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Vienna, Tokyo Russia and America. In 2004 he was elected as a senior Royal Academician. He was taken on by Flowers East in 2004. Latterly he was to see a considerable revival of interest in his work, as general critical interest returned to the abstract painting of the 1960s and early 70s.  Death  In spite of his progressive Cerebella Ataxia he continued to work in his studio with the help and support of the artist Adrian Richardson until a month before his death having been diagnosed with cancer. Kidner was predeceased by his wife Marion in 2004 and their son Simon was killed in a motorbike crash in 1980. He survived to see his last show of his 1960s working studies, Dreams of the World Order at the Royal Academy in September 2009.

The presiding deity of the temple is Siddheshwari Kali, an aspect of Kali, Siddheshwar is the name of Lord Shiva, Siddheshwari is the feminine form of that. The temple was built by Nandy family of Rampara, great devotees of Goddess Kali. The temple is famous for its Kali pooja which is held on October/November during Diwali. Devotees from far villages and from other places reach there to seek the sight of the deity. It is said that the Wooden Kali idol is more than 500 years old.

On 14 September 1982, the ETA members spotted the two vehicles leaving the bar and driving down the road linking San Sebasti√°n and Renter√≠a in the direction of Renter√≠a. In the vicinity of the Landarbaso caves in Aitzbitarte, about three hundred metres from Listorreta park, the police vehicles were forced to slow down at a very steep curve, greatly reducing their speed. On that corner, near a small ravine, and about half a mile from where they had lunch, the two cars were subjected to crossfire from automatic weapons. The police tried to repel the attack by opening fire with their pistols, but without managing to hit any of their attackers, who were protected by the terrain. Two of the officers, Jes√∫s Ord√≥√±ez P√©rez and Juan Seronero Sacrist√°n, were killed instantly. The other three, Alfonso L√≥pez Fern√°ndez, Antonio Cedillo Toscano and Juan Jos√© Torrente Terr√≥n, were all seriously wounded. Both police vehicles were hit by a total of nearly 100 bullets. One of the plainclothes officers, Antonio Cedillo, despite being seriously wounded, was still able to fire at the fleeing ETA members. He then made his way on foot down the road towards Renter√≠a, collapsing 100 metres from the attack in a large pool of blood. A civilian, Jose Elicegui, who lived in a village a few metres from the road junction linking the towns of Oyarzun, Astigarraga and Renteria, was on his way to work when he spotted the police officer and stopped to pick him up to take him to hospital. However, Elicegui was pursued by three ETA members who forced him to stop. After searching his van and finding the wounded police officer, they executed Cedillo with a shot to the neck. The other three ETA members fled on foot from the scene and hijacked a car to escape. Alfonso Lopez Fernandez, one of the two remaining policemen, died while being transported to the Red Cross hospital in San Sebasti√°n. The remaining officer, Juan Jos√© Torrente Terr√≥n, was operated upon arrival to the hospital and, after more than three hours in surgery, was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in a coma. Torrente took over nine months to recover from his wounds. The Civil Guard conducted an intensive search of the area and collected a lot of shell casings from 9mm Parabellum, a type of ammunition commonly used by ETA. The bodies of the policemen killed remained at the scene until the arrival of forensics. ETA claimed responsibility for the attack the same evening in a statement released through the Egin newspaper.Dejad de matar, La Vanguardia, p15, 16 September 1982 In the same statement, they took responsibility for other attacks committed the previous week against a farm owned by the army in San Sebasti√°n and against the Civil Guard barracks in Durango. Funerals The funerals for those killed took place at 7:00 pm the same day in the Civil Government of Guip√∫zcoa. The Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, the Interior Minister Juan Jos√© Ros√≥n, and the Inspector General of Police, Felix Alcala Galiano, travelled to San Sebastian to attend the funerals. Also present were the lehendakari, Carlos Garaikoetxea, the government delegate in the Basque Country, Jaime Mayor Oreja, civil and military governors, the mayor of San Sebasti√°n, Jesus Maria Alcain and Deputy General Javier Aizarna. The main political parties in the area, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) and People's Alliance sent representatives to meet and console the families and victims of the dead. Reactions The Archbishop of San Sebasti√°n issued a communique calling for an end to the killings in the Basque Country. The majority of Basque daily newspapers criticised the attack, with Deia arguing against a vote for Batasuna, the political wing of ETA and Tribuna Vasca criticising in particular the killing of Cedillo, arguing that even in wars, the wounded were not executed. The PNV accused ETA of trying to create pre-election chaos. The PSOE stated that if they won the elections scheduled for the following month, they would use all democratic means in their power to put a definitive end to ETA activity. PSOE executive member Javier Solana added that his party would not negotiate with ETA. The People's Alliance and Euskadiko Ezkerra also strongly condemned the killings. Meanwhile, the UCD in Guip√∫zcoa released a statement sympathising with the State Security Forces. Juli√°n Carmona Fern√°ndez, a police officer who had been charged with accompanying one of the bodies, committed suicide by shooting himself in the head the day after the attacks. This led to speculation that his actions were a result of trauma he had suffered because of the attacks, as some of the dead were his personal friends. Police inspector general Felix Alcala Galiano, however, stated that he did not believe this to be the reason for his suicide.Un sargento de la polic√≠a se suicida dispar√°ndose un tiro en la cabeza, El Pais, 16 September 1982 Police investigations Police sources identified Manuel Urionabarrenechea, alias Manu, as one of the principal organisers of the attack. Manu had been born in Gernika in 1952 and, according to security forces, had also been responsible for the killing of a Civil Guard in Lekeitio in 1978 and three killings in Oiartzun and Renter√≠a in 1981 and 1982, as well as attacks after 1982.ABC (Sevilla), 13 September 1988, p15 He had been arrested by police in 1979, accused of supplying information to ETA,Detenidos en Bilbao seis presuntos colaboradores de ETA, El Pais, 3 June 1979 but was subsequently released. On 21 August 1989, police identified a man in the centre of Vitoria-Gasteiz as Manu and followed him and a 28-year-old ETA suspect, Teodoro Juli√°n Mariscal, to a bar in the centre of the town. However, when they tried to arrest them, according to police sources, the man identified as Manu produced a gun and a firefight ensued. The suspect believed to be Manu escaped by hijacking a car, while Teodoro Juli√°n Mariscal and a civil guard were wounded.Dos heridos en un tiroteo en Vitoria entre la Guardia Civil y un presunto miembro de ETA, El Pais, 22 August 1989 Almost one month later, on 17 September 1989, Manu was one of two ETA suspects killed in a gunfight with civil guards at Irun, while trying to flee in a vehicle to France.

In a hierarchical structure, a name is fully qualified when it \\"is complete in the sense that it includes (a) all names in the hierarchic sequence above the given element and (b) the name of the given element itself.\\"  Programming  Fully qualified names explicitly refer to namespaces that would otherwise be implicit because of the scope of the call. While always done to eliminate ambiguity, this can mean different things dependent on context. Commonly encountered applications of the notion have been given their own names, such as the fully qualified domain name and the fully qualified file name.  Examples  To distinguish a fully qualified name from a regular name, C++, Tcl, Perl and Ruby use two colons (\`::\`), and Java uses dots (\`.\`), as does Visual Basic .NET. and C#. In Java, ActionScript, and other object-oriented languages the use of the dot is known as \\"dot syntax\\". Other examples include: * As an example of a relational database, in Microsoft SQL Server the fully qualified name of an object is the one that specifies all four parts: \`server_name.[database_name].[schema_name].object_name\`. * In Perl, a fully qualified scalar (\`$scalar\`) that is in the package \`package2\` would be referred to as \`$package2::scalar\` * In Ruby, the fully qualified name of a class is the name of such class with all its parent modules, as Vehicles::Cars::Factory would be the fully qualified name of Factory class within Cars module within Vehicles module. * In COBOL, a fully qualified data item name can be created by suffixing a potentially ambiguous identifier with an (or ) phrase. For example, multiple data item records might contain a member item named , so specifying serves to disambiguate a specific data item, specifically, the one that is a member of the parent data item. Multiple clauses may be necessary to fully disambiguate a given identifier, for example, . This syntax is equivalent to the \\"dotted\\" notation employed in many object-oriented programming languages, but with the identifiers specified in reverse order.  Filenames and paths  The term fully qualified file name means a file on a computer whose exact name is completely specified such that it is unambiguous and cannot be mistaken for any other file on that computer system. It is somewhat equivalent on the Internet to a URL specifying the full name of the computer and the entire name of a particular document as a file. The alternative is an unqualified file name or a partially qualified file name. *On Unix-style systems, DOS, and Microsoft Windows, the name \\"sample\\" refers to a file in the current directory named \\"sample\\". If the current directory is changed, then the file referred to by the name \\"sample\\" is different. If you start the filename with \\"/\\" indicating the root directory as in \\"/Users/Name/sample\\", then on Unix this is a fully qualified file name. So, for example, instead of referring to \`./foo/bar/baz.sh\` in \`/home/user/quz\`, which uses a relative pathname, the fully qualified name would be \`/home/user/quz/foo/bar/baz.sh\`. In DOS, the name is still relative to the root directory of the current disk, so to get a fully qualified file name, the file name must be prefixed with the drive letter and a colon, as in \\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Name\\\\sample\\", where \\"C:\\" specifies the \\"C\\" drive. *Also on the above systems, some programs such as the command-line shell will search a path for a file. Inserting a leading (back)slash, as in \\"./name\\", will stop the searching of the path. This is a partially qualified name, but not a fully qualified name as it still depends on the current directory. A fully qualified name, because it contains (back)slashes, will always stop a path search. *On the mainframe operating system MUSIC/SP, if one asks for the file name \\"X\\", one is making an unqualified reference either to the file X in the user's library, or to the file X in the common library if the user does not have a file named X and one does exist in the common library. If, however, one were to refer to \\"*COM:X\\" one is using a fully qualified file name reference to the file X in the common library even if they have a different file named X in their library. Similarly, a reference to \\"*USR:X\\" would mean the file in their own library, and \\"MA45:X\\" would be a fully qualified file name referring to the specific file X in the library of user MA45. *On the RSTS/E operating system on the PDP-11 minicomputer, specifying a file \\"X.X\\" would refer to a file in one's own directory. Referring to \\"$X.X\\" would be referring to the file \\"[1,2]X.X\\" but to fully qualify the file name, one would have to indicate the device, so \\"SY:[46,145]MYFILE.TXT\\", \\"SY:$X.X\\", or \\"SY:[1,2]X.X\\" (the last two examples meaning the same thing) would be a fully qualified file name under RSTS/E. *On the UNIVAC Series 90 mainframe operating system VS/9, specifying a file \\"X\\" could mean either the file X in the account of that user, or could mean the file X in the library of the system manager, $TSOS. However, specifying \\"$S0103.X\\" would be a fully qualified file name. *This term can also include the case where one prefixes a fully qualified file name with a specific computer name as a prefix to a file name (where the particular system permits referencing a file on another system), so long as the exact name is unambiguous.  Path names  Fully qualified path name (FQPN) is the full path of a resource, directory or file, stored in a computer. It is composed by the full path to the resource and its syntax depends on the operating system. In Unix-like operating systems it is represented in the following form: \`/root/path-to/file[OR]directory\`, while in DOS and Microsoft Windows it is represented in the following form: \`[Drive]:\\\\path-to\\\\file.ext[OR]directory\`. FQPN is also used in Networking and takes the following form: \`\\\\root\\\\FQDN\\\\path-to\\\\file.ext[OR]directory\`, where \`/root/\` is the root directory, the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy, and, in this case, the rooted tree; \`FQDN\` is the fully qualified domain name or node. It is also used in bootstrapping, computer programming and in computer science referencing.  Domain names  * In the sense of domain names, used in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), a fully qualified domain name is explicitly suffixed with a dot, to eliminate the step of resolving, and to ensure that no additional suffix is added: \`wikipedia.com.\` for instance. This is an example of a fully qualified domain name.

Porcello (May 23, 1935Samuel J Porcello in Toms River, New Jersey; U.S. Public Records Index ‚Äì May 12, 2012) was an American food scientist who worked at Nabisco for 34 years. He is particularly noted for his work on the modern Oreo cookie. Porcello held five patents directly related to the Oreo. In particular, Porcello was the inventor of the white Oreo cookie creme- filling. His work earned him the nickname, \\"Mr. Oreo.\\" Early life Porcello was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. He also lived in Wayne, New Jersey. He and his family moved to Toms River, New Jersey, in 1974, where he resided for the rest of his life. Porcello initially worked as a teacher for a short time during his early career. He then worked for the former The Charms Company, a candy manufacturer. He was nearly hired by a major cosmetics company, but his candidacy ended when the company learned that Porcello was color blind and a Communist. Career Porcello joined Nabisco after his rejection by the cosmetics industry because he was color-blind. When he was hired, Nabisco promised that he could eventually earn a salary of up to $12,000 dollars per year if he was successful. He began his Nabisco career at the company's plant in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. He later worked at Nabisco's corporate headquarters in East Hanover, New Jersey. Porcello joined Nabisco's research and development department, which develops new lines of snack foods. He was considered one of the world's leading experts on cocoa, which is used to make chocolate. He was given the title, \\"principal scientist,\\" during his career at Nabisco. The Oreo cookie, has been sold since 1912 (450 billion Oreos have been sold since their introduction), but it was Porcello who invented the modern creme-filling for Oreos and Double Stuffed Oreos, which has extra filling. In total, Porcello held five patents related to his work on the Oreo. He also developed a product line of Oreos enrobed in white chocolate and dark chocolate. Porcello found the particular type of chocolate which he used for chocolate-covered Oreos while attending a food industry trade show in Europe. Aside from his work with the Oreo, Porcello developed other Nabisco snack products, including SnackWells. His position required him to travel extensively in search of new potential products and ingredients. According to his son, Curtis, Porcello often brought new snacks home with him to see how his family liked or disliked the potential new products. Porcello was not a huge eater of Oreo cookies, preferring to eat the cookie without dunking it in milk. Later life Porcello left the company as its principal food scientist in 1993 after 34 years. Additionally, he was a longtime volunteer with ACDI/VOCA, for which he helped create a food and program and company in Thailand. Sam Porcello died May 12, 2012, at the age of 76.

Unison World, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 1127, 1133 (N.D. Cal. 1986), was a United States District Court for the Northern District of California software case, initially important in determining how U.S. copyright law applied to the look and feel presented by a software product. It took an expansive position which later courts increasingly rejected. Background Broderbund Software developed The Print Shop, a program to produce signs and greeting cards, running on Apple II computers. Broderbund started discussions with Unison World about creating a version that would run on IBM PC compatibles. The two companies could not agree on a contract, but Unison World went ahead and developed an IBM PC product with similar function and a similar user interface. Broderbund sued for infringement of their copyright. In defense, Unison invoked the merger doctrine, arguing that the idea behind the user interface could not be separated from its expression, so could not be protected by copyright. Decision The court referred to Whelan v. Jaslow, which had earlier that year established the principle that the structure, sequence and organization of a computer program could be subject to copyright (software copyright). Whelan had declared that, \\"the purpose or function of a utilitarian work would be the work's idea, and everything that is not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea ... Where there are various means of achieving the desired purpose, then the particular means chosen is not necessary to the purpose; hence, there is expression, not idea.\\" The court rejected \\"defendant's argument that the overall structure, sequencing, and arrangement of screens in [the program] fall outside the ambit of copyright protection.\\" The court introduced the idea of the \\"total concept and feel\\" of a software work. The court said, \\"the idea of 'Print Shop' is the creation of greeting cards, banners, posters and signs that contain infinitely variable combinations of text, graphics and borders. A rival software publisher is completely free to market a program with the same underlying idea, but it must express the idea through a substantially different structure.\\" The display was held copyrightable since it contained \\"aesthetically pleasing artwork, an entertaining layout and display, and a high degree of stylistic creativity.\\" This case found that copyright registration of a computer program implicitly covers registration of screen displays. Consequences According to one author, \\"the Broderbund court has paved the way for a new and unanticipated application of Whelan. Under Broderbund, software designers will not be able to market programs which use the same, or a substantially similar, user interface ... [T]he ... decision extended copyright protection to a program's menu screens 'without regard for the lack of similarity in the underlying code. In Digital Communications Associates v. Softklone (1987) the court rejected Broderbund, holding that showing screen replication was not sufficient. The plaintiff had to show that the source or object code had substantial similarities. The Copyright Office refused to register copyright in the textual display screens of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software in 1987. On 8 June 1988 the Copyright Office issued a Notice of Decision, summarized as: In Manufacturers Technologies, Inc. v. CAMS Inc. (1989) the court found that the Broderbund approach was too expansive. The court decided that the software and the user interface were distinct, although could each contain copyrightable material, so the program accomplished \\"two interrelated yet distinct registrations.\\" The court decided to review each screen, determine whether it contained expression that could be separated from the purpose or idea underlying the screen, and if so determine whether that expression had been copied. Taking this more detailed approach, the court found that some aspects such as the method of formatting a screen or of navigating within a screen were not subject to copyright, but other aspects of the screen appearance were copyrightable expression.

It was one of several such scientific expeditions from various countries sent around the world to observe the rare astronomical event. Preparation Expedition base on Campbell Island, 1874 The expedition was conducted under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences which established a committee to plan the operation. A year before the transit was due, the French naval frigate FRWS Vire, based at Noum√©a and commanded by Captain J. Jacquemart, visited the island from 28 November to 25 December 1873. The officers and crew of the ship made a thorough survey of the coastline and set up a platform for astronomical equipment on the headland between Camp Cove and Garden Cove in Perseverance Harbour and cleared a path to the beach. They also planted a garden with potatoes, cabbages and other vegetables. The leader of the main expedition was A. Bouquet de la Grye, a naval hydrographer, assisted by hydrographer P. Hatt and naval officer Th. Courrejolles who was in charge of the photographic equipment. The fourth scientist was naturalist and expedition doctor Henri Filhol. They were accompanied by a support staff which included technicians, carpenters and mechanics. The expedition departed Marseilles in June 1874. They reached Sydney on 21 August and joined the Vire which had brought equipment from Noum√©a. They left Sydney on 2 September and arrived at Campbell Island on 9 September. Campbell Island Observatory built by the expedition on Campbell Island, 1874. After briefly checking North East Harbour and rejecting it as a venue for their work, they continued to Perseverance Harbour and Garden Cove. There, finding that there was insufficient space for their encampment and equipment and that nothing had survived in the vegetable garden except for a few cabbages, they set up their camp in Venus Bay instead. September was occupied by unloading the Vire, erecting several prefabricated buildings and constructing a 20 m stone jetty. Pens were built for the sheep and pigs brought as food. On 22 September one of the technicians, Paul Duris, died of typhoid fever and was buried on the point opposite Venus Bay. The encampment was ready for occupation on 1 October. From mid October until mid November the Vire was away and the expedition members filled their time testing their equipment and repairing that which had been damaged on the outward voyage. Filhol collected natural history specimens and observed the wildlife. The weather was not helpful; the expedition endured a series of storms which caused damage to the buildings. On 9 December the skies were cloudy, though as the time of the transit approached the sun appeared briefly giving the observers a view of Venus against the sun's corona ‚Äì a view obscured by clouds at the moment of first contact. They also had a twenty-second view of Venus at the end of the transit between third and fourth contacts as it was half off the sun's disc. No useful measurements were able to be made. It took three weeks for the expedition to dismantle their camp and load the ship. They departed on 28 December. Although observations and measurements of the transit had been unsuccessful, Filhol published a comprehensive account of his examination of the natural history of the island, while the chart produced by the naval officers subsequently formed the basis of maps of the island and British Admiralty charts for several decades. Many geographic features were named by the expedition after its own personnel and members of the transit committee in Paris, as well as for other expedition-related objects, including: * Courrejolles Point * De la Vire Point * Filhol Peak * Garden Cove * Jacquemart Island * Mount Azimuth * Mount Dumas * Mount Faye * Mount Fizeau * Mount Paris * Puiseux Peak * Venus Bay * Yvon Villarceau Peak Other expeditions The Campbell Island expedition was one of six French expeditions sent to observe the 1874 transit. The other two sites in the southern hemisphere were Saint Paul Island in the Indian Ocean and Noum√©a in New Caledonia, while in the northern hemisphere French astronomers visited Nagasaki in Japan, Peking in China, and Saigon in Vietnam.

Likewise, most European tourists who visit the Philippines come from the United Kingdom, with about 90,000 visitors yearly. The UK government spends in the region of ¬£2 million per year of funding to facilitate scientific collaboration with the Philippines. The fund, administered through the British Embassy Manila, is to foster science and innovation partnerships for joint research on development topics, researcher training and fellowships, and innovation capacity building programmes. These joint projects tackle priority development concerns such as environmental resilience, food and energy security, and health. Former British Ambassador Asif Ahmad said: \\"Science and technology are key drivers to economic development. The Newton Fund will engage British and Filipino scientists as partners to increase their research and innovation capacity. The application of knowledge, tailored to the needs of the people of the Philippines, will address their current priorities and address long-term sustainable growth. The British invention of the internet transformed lives and it is not beyond reason to hope that Filipino-UK ingenuity could unlock further discovery.\\" In 2020, as part of the UK Government's Future Cities Program, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to design the New Clark City Central Park and an affordable housing project in the new metropolis.
