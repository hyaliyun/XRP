It is a theater company out of East Lansing, Michigan. The founder and co-Artistic Director is Chad Badgero. Founded in 1995 and originally named the Peppermint Creek Players, PCTC performed one play a summer. The company is named after the creek that runs near founder Chad Badgero‚Äôs childhood home in Mason, MI. As a fifth grader, Badgero was looking through old maps of Mason and found where his house would have been, and the creek was THEN called Peppermint Creek (it has since been changed to the name of the road it cuts through). This stuck with Badgero, and when it came time to name the group, it seemed appropriate and personal. The first two productions were presented at Mount Hope Presbyterian Church, and then moved to the MSU Gardens Conservatory. From 1995-2000, Peppermint Creek established itself as a new, fresh, and vital performing arts group that took chances and believed in the power of theatre. When Mr. Badgero returned from a year in New York City, he brought with him the desire to completely establish PCTC as a non-profit organization with a full season of shows. Peppermint Creek Theatre Company has performed at the Basement 414 and Creole Art Gallery, Lansing art galleries., Mount Hope Presbyterian Church, Woldumar Nature Center, MSU Auditorium Rm 49, MSU Greenhouses, and currently at the Miller Performing Arts Center.

Its Atlantic Fleet equivalent is Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic which is based at NAS Oceana, Virginia.  History  SFWSPAC was established on October 15, 1973 at Naval Air Station Lemoore as Light Attack Weapons School, Pacific (LAWSPAC). In reality, the history of the school dates back ten years when the Weapons Training Center was established under the co-management of Attack Squadron 122 (today VFA-122) and Attack Squadron 125 (today VFA-125). When the A-7 Corsair II came into service and the intensified tempo of fleet operations and its training requirements expanded, Weapons Training Center was moved to Commander Fleet Air Lemoore (presently Commander, Strike Fighter Wing, US Pacific Fleet). Due to the sophistication in attack weaponry and delivery systems, LAWSPAC was formed as a parallel training component within Weapons Training Center, which was devoted to train Weapons Training Officers. Soon, the Chief of Naval Operations recognized the need for postgraduate weapons training and expressed the desire to create a commissioned unit, the stated goal was that ‚Äúeventually all pilots and every career aviator should have special training in weapons.\\" Commander, Light Attack Wing, US Pacific Fleet, commissioned the Weapons Training Center as LAWSPAC, a permanently shored based command at NAS Lemoore. On July 1, 1988, LAWSPAC was redesignated to Strike Fighter Weapons School, Pacific due to the expanded growth of F/A-18 units in the Navy. In August 1996, the Intelligence Department of the Strike Fighter Wing Pacific was incorporated into SFWSPAC to enhance the strike planning and support training for fleet squadrons. Today, SFWSPAC is dedicated to provide standardized graduate level training of F/A-18 weapons employment and dedicated to guaranteeing the combat readiness of the Strike Fighter Community by providing the best possible training in mission planning, tactics, weapons systems and ordnance handling. Thirty weapons and tactics courses for strike fighter aircraft are taught on a continuing basis. The total amount of ordnance uploaded in courses totals over 2 ¬Ω million pounds annually. Currently SFWSPAC is staffed with 23 officers, 29 enlisted personnel and 7 civilians.

Various proposals were promoted during the 2007 general election campaign.  Proposals  In 2004, the Scottish Socialist Party launched a \\"Scrap the Council Tax\\" campaign, boosted by a poll suggesting 77% of Scots supported the abolition of the tax. A bill proposing a progressive system of taxation based on a household's income was presented in 2005, but was defeated with 12 MSPs in favour, 94 against, and 6 abstaining. Although the SNP and the Liberal Democrats supported the principle of income-based taxation, they disagreed with the SSP's specific proposals, which would have exempted anyone with an annual income of less than ¬£10,000 and reduced liabilities for anyone with an annual income of less than ¬£30,000, while targeting revenue generation to household incomes in excess of ¬£90,000. Different proposals to abolish council tax formed part of the manifestos of the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats during the Scottish Parliament general election of May 2007. The SNP version involves the centralised distribution of funds raised from the new tax throughout the Scottish local authorities whereas the Liberal Democrats' proposal devolves the distribution to individual authorities. The SSP said under its proposals, unlike other local income tax schemes, the set- up costs and problems of fiscal flight would be insignificant, as the tax rates are not set locally. After the 2007 election, the SNP-run Scottish Government planned to bring forward legislation to replace Council Tax with a local income tax as part of the funding for Scottish local authorities.Local income tax on way as early as 2010, The Scotsman, 19 August 2007 A major setback took place when the UK government said it would withhold almost ¬£400 million in Council Tax Benefit if the Scottish government implemented the proposals.Scrapping council tax has ¬£400m price tag - Browne, The Scotsman, 20 August 2007 Controversially, the UK government said it would, however, release the funds for a tax scheme designed by Scottish Labour.

Unlike virus signatures, SONAR examines the behavior of applications to decide whether they are malicious. SONAR is built upon technology Symantec acquired in its late 2005 purchase of WholeSecurity, a developer of behavioral anti- malware and anti-phishing software solutions in the United States. How it works An algorithm is used to evaluate hundreds of attributes relating to software running on a computer. Various factors are considered before determining that a program is malicious, such as if the program adds a shortcut on the desktop or creates a Windows Add/Remove programs entry. Both of those factors would indicate the program is not malware. The main use of SONAR is to enhance detection of zero day threats. Symantec claims SONAR can also prevent attackers from leveraging unpatched software vulnerabilities. Ed Kim, director of product management at Symantec, expressed confidence in SONAR, \\"We've done extensive testing on emerging threats, and it catches early threats and variants of existing threats.\\" History Symantec already had a behavior analysis security tool for enterprises, known as Critical System Protection. SONAR was introduced to serve the consumer antivirus market. =SONAR 1= SONAR was first offered as an add-on for Norton AntiVirus 2007 and Norton Internet Security 2007; subsequent annual editions of the Norton line have had SONAR, as well. =SONAR 2= SONAR 2 is part of Norton 2010 and Norton 360 v.4 antivirus software. According to the company, this version leverages data from more sources, including reputation data about a program. Therefore, SONAR 2 is able to more accurately detect security risks than it was before. =SONAR 3= SONAR 3 came with the Norton 2011 public beta. It is available for Norton 2010 customers with legitimate subscriptions through updates, Norton 2011 customers, and Norton 360 v.5 public beta users. According to the company, SONAR 3 is fine-tuned to better detect fake antivirus software and is better integrated with the network component. They advise: \\"In SONAR 3 we have further enhanced our integration with the network component in order to classify, convict, and remediate malware on the basis of its malicious network activity. With this feature in place, we will continue to block and remove many new variants of malware that leave their network footprint unchanged.\\" According to Symantec it is now monitoring about 400 aspects of each application to determine whether it is safe or harmful. =SONAR 4= SONAR 4 was introduced with the 2012 BETA versions. According to a Norton Protection Blog post in the Norton Community, titled \\"What's new in Norton Internet Security 2012\\": > \\"With 2012 we are introducing SONAR Policy Enforcement ‚Äì We now have the > ability to convict a suspicious process based on a behavioral ‚Äúprofile.‚Äù To > create these profiles, an analyst looks at the 500+ attributes that SONAR > tracks and make a series of associations.

The course is considered to stand within the conservative evangelical tradition. Christianity Explored Ministries has also developed a second evangelistic course in 2016 Life Explored.  Course outline and versions  The third edition of the course was published on 10 May 2011. The sessions are: # Good News # Identity # Sin # The Cross # Resurrection # Grace # Come and Die There is also a day away that features three bonus sessions: The Sower, James and John and Herod. Spin-offs include a youth version, revised in 2010 for two age groups: 11 to 14 years (\\"CY Nano\\") and 15 plus (\\"CY\\"). The seven session \\"Soul\\" DVD is designed to work with CY, and can also be used as a stand-alone resource. There is a follow-on course entitled \\"Discipleship Explored\\", written and presented by Barry Cooper, and \\"English Made Easy\\" editions of both Christianity Explored and Discipleship Explored. Christianity Explored publications are also available in Bulgarian, Dutch, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Luganda, Polish, Spanish, Swahili and Welsh. Translations in progress include French, Mandarin, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish. In 2011 the course, already being used in over 50 countries, was rolled out in the United States: it was endorsed by John Piper and Tim Keller.http://www.christiantoday.com/article/christianity.explored.expands.to.the.us/28156.htm  Use  The Church of England generally (e.g. in the 2003 publication \\"Evangelism - Which Way Now?\\") considers it, along with Alpha and the Emmaus Discipleship Course, as one of a \\"trinity\\" of courses covering all wings of the church. Other churches have also used the course: in 2006-7 the Presbyterian Church in Ireland‚Äôs board of youth and children's ministry used the youth version CY extensively with the Boys Brigades. It has also been used in Asia, with leader training run by the Methodist Church in Singapore. The course is popular with conservative evangelical churches.  Comparison with other evangelistic courses  Christianity Explored is distinguished from the Alpha Course by shorter videos in less formal settings, less charismatic emphasis on the Holy Spirit and by an expositional study of scripture ‚Äì in this case Mark‚Äôs Gospel. 9 Marks comments that Christianity Explored is \\"plainly an answer to the Alpha course\\". It says that the course does a \\"fairly good job of explaining the gospel clearly\\" but finds it over-full of material, and holds the view that \\"the use of the sinners' prayer and immediate assurance is ... troubling.\\" It credits Christianity Explored with \\"the best treatment of sin, giving it a whole session\\", along with a good treatment of grace and the atonement. This is in agreement with (or perhaps derivative from) a 2001 article in the British Evangelical Council magazine which commended Christianity Explored, in direct contrast to Alpha, for its teaching on grace, penal substitution and the Holy Spirit. The course has been described as a conservative evangelical alternative to the charismatic leanings of the Alpha Course. The 2003 book 'Evangelism: Which Way Now?' offers a detailed examination of the benefits and drawbacks of Christianity Explored amongst other evangelistic courses and approaches to evangelism.

A new notosuchian from the Early Cretaceous of Niger. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 23 (2): 477-482. Its duck-like snout coincidentally makes it resemble a crocoduck, an imagined hybrid animal with the head of a crocodile and the body of a duck. Species and discovery Skull from multiple angles The type species of Anatosuchus is A. minor, in reference to its small body size. The holotype material (MNN GDF603), is a nearly complete skull with articulated lower jaws, belonging to a juvenile. It was discovered from the upper portion of the Elrhaz Formation and lower portion of Echkar Formation, indicating an Early Cretaceous (Late Aptian or Early Albian) age. Another specimen was found later (MNN GAD17) belonging to an adult, which had both the skull and much of the postcranial skeleton. Differences in the skull indicate that the unusual broad, flattened shape developed as the animal grew older. Systematics Restoration In the initial description of Anatosuchus, it formed a clade with Comahuesuchus, within a less inclusive Notosuchia, also found to be monophyletic. However, further work proposed that Anatosuchus is not closely related to Comahuesuchus, but instead is a member of Uruguaysuchidae.Andrade MB, Bertini RJ, Pinheiro AEP. 2006.

PLoS ONE 13(8): e0199984. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199984  Features  = Skull and jaws = The premaxillae are broad and flat, and form a line straight across the front of Anatosuchus's snout; each holds six recurved teeth which point backwards into the mouth. The internarial processes of the premaxillae taper steeply up towards the projecting nasals; they begin as very wide, meaning that the external nares are dorsoventrally compressed. The premaxillae also form the floor of the narial passages, including a small flange which causes the nares to point up and out somewhat. This gives Anatosuchus a visible projecting nose on the front of its broad snout. The smooth narial fossae are located just behind these, and help to give the snout its broad flattened look. The maxillae are, by quite a long way, the largest and most expansive bones in the skull; each holds nineteen small recurved teeth. They have a narrow alveolar margin at the edge of their broad expanse, giving the head of Anatosuchus a rather rectangular appearance, and broad rami that extend above and below the antorbital opening. The upper of these rami form a long suture with the nasal, and then meet the prefrontal and lacrimal directly above the antorbital fenestra. The alveolar margin is vertically oriented, but runs anteroposteriorly rather than transversely as that of the premaxilla does. The maxilla is quite highly textured with pits and neurovascular canals, although far less than the nasal, frontal and parietal bones in particular. The maxillae also form much of the palate, particularly at the anterior section of the palate; the palatine bones form almost all the remainder. The median one- third (measured transversely from left to right) is arched dorsally, making the buccal cavity larger, whereas the two lateral thirds by this measure are horizontal. There is a slit-shaped foramen on each maxilla on the palate. The very posterior section is formed by the pterygoid and ectopterygoid; these also form the projecting posteroventral mandibular rami. The choanae are as far back as possible without contacting the suborbital fenestrae; there is a thin choanal septum between them where they emerge in the pterygoids. The nasal bones are quite long, and sutured together along their whole length; they begin just behind the internarial bar where the premaxillae meet, and end with two processes beneath the frontal bone. The lacrimal bones are L-shaped, with one ramus projecting forwards to meet the maxilla and one ramus projecting downwards to form part of the orbit. The lacrimal also has a small process for articulating with a palpebral, which projects out over the orbit; although the palpebrals are disarticulated, they have fallen into orbits and so can be examined. Both anterior and posterior palpebrals were present above each orbit. The prefrontal bones are shaped rather like a stylised capital I, wider at each of the ends, and effectively separate the nasals and lacrimals. The frontal bones are fused into one large bone, as are the parietals. The frontal-parietal suture is strong and highly interdigitating; although the frontals bear a medial crest, the parietal skull table is flat save for the deep pits across it. In the juvenile specimen, the interorbital width is less than the width across the skull table (between the two supratemporal fenestrae), but in the adult interorbital width is almost twice skull table width. The supratemporal fenestrae have distinctive corners in them, formed by projections of the frontal bone. This feature seems to have occurred as the animal grew older. The postorbital bones are small and slightly curved; they possess articulations for the posterior palpebral. The squamosal bones, right at the back and top of the skull, are triradiate, with slender anterior processes that contact the postorbitals and offset posterior processes that dip down to the braincase. The jugals have relatively long anterior rami, but not long enough to contact the antorbital fossae. There is a small oval fossa located beneath each orbit. The quadratojugals are partially fused to the quadrates close to their condyles, but do not form part of any jaw articulation. The quadrates are angled posteroventrally from the otic region to their condyles. The braincase is quite well preserved. The supraoccipitals are small and triangular, with a short vertical nuchal keel on the occiput; large flanges extend off this to each side. The paraoccipital processes, which contact both the squamosals and the quadrate condyles, are marked with a series of striations. The occipital condyles are ventrally deflected and are formed almost entirely by the basioccipitals. Each side of the skull has three Eustachian foramina present - two on each basioccipital, one anterior and one posterior, and one between basisphenoid and otoccipital in the basal tuber. A pair of crests runs between the quadrate and the pterygoid on each lateral side of the braincase. The lower jaw is U-shaped, to match the upper jaw; the dentary bears twenty-one teeth on each side. The dentary becomes broader transversely than dorsoventrally as it turns the corners of the U-shape, due to wide and vascularised dentary shelves and alveolar margins. The two dentary bones are interdigitating at their symphysis, meaning that the lower jaw is entirely inflexible. The dentary projects somewhat posteriorly, forming the edge of the external mandibular fenestra. Both angular and surangular extend to the top of the coronid process, and the surangular forms much of the jaw articulation. The articular has a glenoid for the quadrate condyles; it is saddle-shaped, with no anterior or posterior lip, although there is a prominent attachment crest posteroventral to the jaw joint. The teeth have subconical crowns that curve in towards the centre of the mouth; all are fairly small and not very worn, indicating relatively little use. Most of the teeth have small carinae present on their surfaces. The dentary sypmhysis has no teeth present to either side of it for 11 mm, but forms a sharpish edge which may have been used with the premaxillary teeth 1-3 for cutting into prey. The largest teeth are found at the corners of the skull. = Vertebral column, ribs and osteoderms = Anatosuchus has a proatlas vertebra, eight cervical vertebrae and probably 16 dorsal vertebrae, though only 15 are preserved. There are also two sacral vertebrae. The dorsal vertebrae are amphicoelous, while the cervical centra lack hypapophyses. The proatlas is an inverted V-shaped piece of bone with a dorsal keel and is quite large relative to the atlas, which is made up of two separate neural arches. The axis has a low, subrectangular neural spine; neural spines grow taller along the cervical vertebrae, with that of the third cervical vertebra being twice as tall as long and that of the seventh being almost five times as tall as long. The dorsal vertebrae are relatively long compared to their width, with length always more than half the width across the transverse processes. The ribs of the atlas and axis vertebrae are straight, whereas those of the other cervical vertebrae are short and triradiate. Dorsal ribs bend ventrally after they clear the osteoderm shield, forming a slight flange along the anterior margin; the ones closer to the posterior end have only one head. The gastralia are quite poorly preserved between the girdles. Osteoderms appear only to have been present on the dorsal surface; they were in pairs sutured together, each pair corresponding to one dorsal vertebra or up to three cervical ones. The articulation between rows is minimal, limited to a slight overlap between rows next to each other. The osteoderms are trapezoidal in shape and quite pitted; they articulate via a facet in the centre of the suture with their corresponding vertebra, the top of the neural spine of which fits into the facet. = Limbs = The scapulae are quite broad, but do not flare very widely at the distal end of the blade, which is tucked under the osteoderms. The coracoids are highly elongated. The humeri are long and have straight shafts; they are quite slender, with the width less than 10% of the length. The fossae on them where the olecranon processes would fit are strongly developed, suggesting that the legs could be held quite straight. The radii have strongly flared proximal ends, and are noticeably shorter than the ulnae since these extend along the edges of the radiales. The ulnae are relatively curved. The radiales are strong, heavy bones, almost as wide as the radii, while the ulnares are poorly preserved. The manus are very large, and have strange fourth digits; each one has six phalanges, rather than the normal four, although the total length is still only around 80% of that of the other digits. This is mainly due to their elongated unguals. which have a narrow attachment groove along their length and are quite strongly arched. It is not known what benefit these specialised features conferred.  Palaeobiology  Restoration As the specific name indicates, A. minor was a very small crocodylomorph, with an adult body length estimated at around 70 centimeters. It had a very broad, duck-like snout. Despite its appearance it is considered to have a diet of small, aquatic creatures, and to get them it may have waded in water like a heron.

England won the series 1‚Äì0 with two matches drawn. A total of 25 first-class matches were played and the West Indian side won eight of them and lost six, with the others drawn. The tour was abandoned a few days after the final test match because of the worsening international situation with World War II imminent. The last six matches from 26 August to 12 September were cancelled (see the schedule in the 1940 Wisden). West Indies did not play test cricket again until January 1948 when England came to the Caribbean and played four test matches. England did not play test cricket after August 1939 until their 1946 season when India toured. The 1940 Wisden had Learie Constantine of Barbados as Cricketer of the Year along with English players Bill Edrich, Walter Keaton, Brian Sellars and Doug Wright (see Wisden on Cricinfo).

Of the 16 players in the side, Martindale, Barrow and Headley had toured with the previous West Indies side to visit England in 1933, and Constantine (who toured England in 1923 and 1928) and Grant had been co-opted to that side for a few matches. Constantine had played in West Indies' first- ever Test on the 1928 tour and Sealy (the youngest test player for the WI) had played Test cricket in the first matches in the West Indies in 1929‚Äì30. Grant and Hylton had made their Test debuts in the 1934‚Äì35 series in the West Indies. Eight of the nine other players in the side made their Test debuts during the 1939 tour. They were Cameron, Clarke, Gomez, Johnson, the Stollmeyer brothers, Weekes and Williams. Only Bayley was not capped on this tour, and he never played Test cricket (he probably would have but for the war).  The Test series Three Test matches of three days' duration each were played on the tour. =First Test at Lord's, June 24, 26, 27= Headley, with 106 in the first innings and 107 in the second, became the first cricketer to make separate hundreds in a Test at Lord's. It was the second time he had achieved this feat against England, having made 114 and 112 at Georgetown in 1929-30. Jeff Stollmeyer, on his Test debut, made 59 out of 147 in West Indies' first innings, and Bill Copson, also making his Test debut, took five for 85. England's reply was based on 196 for Len Hutton. Hutton shared a fourth wicket partnership of 248 with Denis Compton, who made 120. With the whole of the final day to save the match, West Indies looked to be on course at 190 for four, but lost their last six wickets for 35 runs. Copson took four in the innings to finish with match figures of nine for 152. England had 110 minutes to make 99 for victory and did it with 35 minutes to spare. =Second Test at Old Trafford, July 22, 24, 25= Rain and bad light ruined the match, with only 35 minutes play possible on the first day. Clarke's leg- spin and Grant's off-spin caused an England collapse to 62 for five, but Joe Hardstaff made 76 out of 111 in 100 minutes. England declared when Hardstaff was out with the thought that the pitch would get more difficult, but Grant made 47 out of 56 with three sixes off Tom Goddard. On the morning of the last day, only Headley, with 51, offered much resistance, Bill Bowes taking six for 33 in 17.4 (eight-ball) overs. England's batsmen failed to take the initiative in the second innings, and the match petered out to a draw. The catch that Wally Hammond took to dismiss Headley in West Indies' second innings was his 100th in Tests: the first player to achieve this apart from wicketkeepers. =Third Test at The Oval, August 19, 21, 22= Debutant Johnson took the wicket of Walter Keeton with his first delivery in Test cricket, but Norman Oldfield made 80 on his first appearance for England, and with Hutton making 73 and Hardstaff 94, England were all out for 352 before the end of the first day. Jeff Stollmeyer and Headley both made 50s for West Indies in a cautious start on the second day, but then Vic Stollmeyer, making his Test debut, and Weekes added 163 in 100 minutes for the fifth wicket. Stollmeyer was out for 96 but Weekes went on to a hundred in 100 minutes and finished with 137. On the final morning, Constantine hit 79 out of 103 from the final 92 balls of the innings. England lost Keeton and Oldfield cheaply in their second innings, but Hutton (165 not out) and Hammond (138) shared a third wicket partnership of 264, then a world Test record, to make the match and the series safe.

Hobbs described a total of 286 species (including 168 crayfish species and 104 entocytherid ostracods), 38 genera and subgenera (29 for crayfish, 8 entocytherids and Neopalaemon, a shrimp), and one new family, Cambaridae. His work massively increased the knowledge of crayfish biology, and he authored or co-authored over 40% of the recognized species of North American crayfish. Horton has thus been referred to as \\"Old Man Crawfish\\" amongst his colleagues for his decades of research. Hobbs died on March 22, 1994 of heart disease.

England won the series 3-0 with two matches drawn. West Indies' spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine were unable to repeat the success they had on the 1950 tour, and though the young Wes Hall was in the team, the fast bowling was not yet as potent as it would be in a few years, and Hall did not play in the Tests. West Indies side The West Indies team was captained by John Goddard, who had led the successful 1950 team. The vice-captain was Clyde Walcott but towards the end of the tour, when both Goddard and Walcott were injured, the team was captained in some matches by Frank Worrell who \\"showed unmistaken gifts of leadership\\", according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.

West Indies won the series 3-1 with one match drawn. The tour was arranged at shorter notice than usual following the big success of the 1963 tour, with touring teams from New Zealand and South Africa \\"doubling up\\" in the 1965 season so that the West Indies could be brought back sooner than scheduled. The West Indies team The touring team was captained by Gary Sobers, with Conrad Hunte as the vice-captain. The team manager was the former West Indies Test captain Jeffrey Stollmeyer. The full side was: * Gary Sobers, captain * Conrad Hunte, vice-captain * David Allan * Rawle Brancker * Basil Butcher * Joey Carew * Rudolph Cohen * Lance Gibbs * Charlie Griffith * Wes Hall * Jackie Hendriks * David Holford * Rohan Kanhai * Peter Lashley * Easton McMorris * Seymour Nurse * Joe Solomon Twelve of the team had toured England on the 1963 tour. The newcomers were Brancker, Cohen, Hendriks, Holford and Lashley, and only Brancker, Cohen and Holford had not played Test cricket before the tour. Holford played in all five Tests on the tour but Brancker and Cohen did not appear in the Test series and never won a Test cap. Test series summary =First Test at Old Trafford, 2‚Äì4 June 1966= England's first three-day defeat since 1938 came about through dominant batting by the West Indies' captain and vice-captain, followed up by high quality spin on a receptive pitch. Hunte hit 135 out of 283 in five hours on the first day, and then Sobers took over with 161 in 248 minutes. England dropped several catches, including both century-makers, and of the bowlers only Fred Titmus, with five for 83, emerged with credit. England started badly, with Colin Milburn run out for a duck in his first Test innings, and only a late stand between Jim Parks and David Allen lasted long against the spin of Gibbs (5-37) and Holford (3-34 on his debut). In the follow-on, Milburn made a quick 94 with sixes off Hall and Gibbs, but of the other batsmen only Colin Cowdrey (69) coped with the spin of Gibbs and Sobers. Gibbs finished with five for 69, taking his match figures to 10 for 106. =Second Test at Lord's, 16‚Äì21 June 1966= One of the great partnerships of Test cricket took the match away from England after they appeared to be on the way to a straightforward victory. Sobers and Holford came together with West Indies just nine runs ahead with five second innings wickets down. In 320 minutes, they put on an unbeaten 274, with Sobers making 163 and Holford, in just his second Test, 105. Earlier sound batting by Butcher, Nurse and Sobers in West Indies's first innings middle order enabled a respectable total despite Higgs' six wickets for 91. England's reply relied on 96 from Tom Graveney, 91 from Jim Parks and 60 from Geoffrey Boycott. Basil D'Oliveira, in his first Test, was unluckily run out when a shot from Parks deflected on to the stumps at the bowler's end and Hall pulled a stump out. After Sobers' second innings declaration, England lost four quick wickets, but Milburn, in his second Test also, hit an unbeaten 126 and he and Graveney saw out time. =Third Test at Trent Bridge, 30 June‚Äì5 July 1966= As at Lord's, West Indies displayed second innings resilience in the face of a deficit, and this time took it through to victory. This time the hero was Butcher, whose unbeaten 209 was stretched across three consecutive century partnerships - 110 with Kanhai (63), 107 with Nurse (53) and then 173 with Sobers (94). Earlier, Nurse with 93 had alone offered forceful resistance in a first innings dominated by pace, though Lashley made a stubborn 49. England's lead was due largely to three players: Graveney (109) and Cowdrey (96) put on 169 after three wickets had gone for 13, and then D'Oliveira made 76 to shepherd the tail to a 90-run lead, sharing a last-wicket stand of 65 with Derek Underwood, who was making his debut. Sobers' declaration left England more than a full day to survive, and though Boycott made 71, including a six off Sobers, and D'Oliveira 54, the match ended with 85 minutes to spare. =Fourth Test at Headingley, 4‚Äì8 August 1966= An overwhelming victory with more than a day to spare was built on a fifth wicket stand of 265 between Nurse, who made 137, and Sobers (174). England suffered from the West Indian pace attack - in Milburn's case literally so, for he was forced to retire hurt after a blow to the elbow. Not until D'Oliveira (88) and Higgs (49) came together at 83 for six was there resistance, and Sobers took five for 41. It was a similar story in the follow-on, with Bob Barber reaching 55 but otherwise only the injured Milburn passing 40. Gibbs took six for 39 and Sobers, mostly bowling spin, a further three to finish with match figures of eight for 80 to go with his 174. =Fifth Test at The Oval, 18‚Äì22 August 1966= Wholesale changes to the England side, including a new captain in Brian Close, led to a smarter bowling and fielding performance, but England's victory was based on surprise batting contributions from lower order players. West Indies won the toss for the fifth time, but only Kanhai, with 104, and Sobers (81) prospered against a varied attack. England in turn slumped to 166 for seven before wicket-keeper John Murray joined Graveney. Together they put on 217 for the eighth wicket, with Graveney hitting 165 and Murray's 112 more than doubling his previous Test best. The ninth wicket fell at 399, but Higgs and Snow then scored maiden first-class 50s in a last wicket stand of 128, two short of the-then Test record. Butcher made a quick 60, but Sobers was out for a duck and though Nurse made 70, West Indies were all out with more than a day-and-a-half to spare. Other matches The West Indians played 22 other first-class matches in addition to the Tests, winning five, losing three and drawing 14. Their wins were against Cambridge University, Derbyshire, Kent, Warwickshire and Leicestershire. They lost to Sussex, Northamptonshire and T. N. Pearce's XI. Including the Tests, their record was eight wins, four defeats and 15 draws. They also played six one-day matches and one two-day match, which were not first-class; of these they won five, lost one and drew one.

In her 1910 autobiography she described various ways in which she attempted to imitate her father, as well as establishing him as her primary influencer. She stated that her father was her reason for civic involvement and interest in the \\"moral concerns of life.\\"Addams, Jane.

It was Addams' deep civic involvement that had such a profound influence on his daughter, Jane. John Addams was active in the Cedarville School Board and a trustee of the Rockford Young Ladies' Seminary, later known as Rockford College, where Jane would earn her undergraduate degree. Besides his role in founding the state's Republican Party he was also one of the key individuals who helped bring the second Lincoln-Douglas Debate to Freeport. Late life and death In 1867, four years after Sarah Addams' death, John H. Addams was remarried to Anna H. Haldeman. Haldeman was herself a widow who brought two additional children of her own into the family. One of her sons, George, would also have a strong influence on Jane Addams. In early August 1881 Addams decided to take his family on a vacation in northwestern Michigan, where he planned to inspect some of the iron and copper ore mines as potential investments; they left on August 4. A week later John Addams became ill while climbing in an ore mine and the family decided to return home by train. They made it to Green Bay, Wisconsin before Addams was too sick to travel any further and the family booked a hotel room. John H. Addams died suddenly of acute appendicitis on August 17, 1881 in the hotel in Green Bay at the age of 59.Knight, Louise W.

England won the series 2‚Äì0 with one match drawn. After this, England would not win another test series against the West Indies for 31 years.http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/94016.html The West Indian tour was scheduled for the first half of the English cricket season, and the weather for much of May 1969 was damp and cold. A second touring side, from New Zealand, played three Tests against England in the second half of the season - see the article New Zealand cricket team in England in 1969. The West Indies team The touring team was captained by Gary Sobers. Lance Gibbs was the vice-captain, although Basil Butcher acted as captain in a couple of the matches. The full team was: * Gary Sobers, captain * Lance Gibbs, vice- captain * Philbert Blair * Basil Butcher * Steve Camacho * Joey Carew * Charlie Davis * Michael Findlay * Maurice Foster * Roy Fredericks * Jackie Hendriks * Vanburn Holder * Clive Lloyd * Pascall Roberts * John Shepherd * Grayson Shillingford Only five players - Sobers, Gibbs, Butcher, Carew and Hendriks - had been on the previous tour of England in 1966. There were seven players with no previous Test experience in the party: five of them - Findlay, Foster, Holder, Shepherd and Shillingford - made their Test debuts in this series. The other two, Blair and Roberts, never played Test match cricket. Notable absentees were Rohan Kanhai (injured) and wicketkeeper Deryck Murray, who would not be released for the full tour by Nottinghamshire.Test Cricket Tours - West Indies to England 1969 The Test Matches =First Test at Old Trafford, June 12‚Äì17, 1969= England's success was built on 128 from Geoffrey Boycott, who shared a 112 opening partnership with John Edrich (58) and a third wicket 128 with Tom Graveney, who scored 75 in his 79th and final Test, during which he was 42 years old. West Indies dropped eight catches on the first day alone. Basil D'Oliveira (51) and the tail took the total beyond 400 and West Indies were soon five for two with both openers gone. David Brown and John Snow each took four wickets and no West Indian batsman reached 35. England captain Ray Illingworth enforced the follow-on, and despite consistent batting by the upper order, with 64 from Fredericks, 44 from Carew, 48 from Butcher and 48 also from Sobers, the deficit was only just cleared. =Second Test at Lord's, June 26-July 1, 1969= Batsmen dominated in sunny conditions. West Indies opened with 106 from Camacho (67) and Fredericks (63) and Davis hit 103 in 375 minutes. At 61 for five, England were in trouble, but debutant John Hampshire hit 107 and shared a 128-run sixth wicket partnership with Alan Knott, and then captain Ray Illingworth hit his first Test century, 113, and John Snow contributed only nine to a last-wicket partnership of 84. West Indies batted brightly, with Fredericks making 60 and Lloyd 70, and Sobers, batting with a runner, contributed an unbeaten 50 before declaring, setting England 322 to win in five hours. They made too slow a start, so that when Phil Sharpe (86) and opener Boycott (106) accelerated with a partnership of 126 in 90 minutes, they had left too little time to complete the task. =Third Test at Headingley, July 10‚Äì15, 1969= A slow pitch and damp conditions favoured the bowlers. Edrich's 79 and 40s from D'Oliveira and Knott led England to 223, but no West Indian managed more than 35. Shepherd was unable to bat in West Indies' first innings and could not bowl in England's second, where all players except Boycott made 15 or more, but none reached 40. Set 303 to win in better conditions, West Indies looked to be on course when Camacho, with 71, and Butcher (91) put on 108 for the third wicket, which fell at 177. At 219 for three, Butcher, Sobers (for a duck), Lloyd and Shepherd went for the addition of just nine runs and the tail was able to prolong the match only an hour into the last day.

WLVA is owned and operated by Brent Epperson. It airs a talk radio format. Most of the hosts are nationally syndicated: Rick and Bubba, Brian Kilmeade, Todd Starnes, Michael Savage, Ben Shapiro and Mark Levin. The transmitter is on Ragland Road in Lynchburg.Radio-Locator.com/WLVA WLVA is also heard on FM translator station W231CE at 94.1 MHz. History WLVA was Lynchburg's first radio station, signing on for the first time at 7:00 PM on April 21, 1930 on 1370 kHz. By 1934, WLVA was broadcasting at a power of 100 watts. At a time when many local radio stations were owned by or affiliated with newspapers, WLVA was not; consequently, the station frequently found itself in direct competition with Lynchburg's papers. In 1934, WLVA allied itself with the Washington Herald which was attempting to increase circulation in the Lynchburg area. The Herald's Lynchburg correspondent, Nowlin Puckett, furnished local news on WLVA from August until December 1934. In late 1934, WLVA experimented with rebroadcasting selected programs from station WLW (Cincinnati, Ohio). Most listeners in Lynchburg could not ordinarily receive WLW, but WLVA installed a special high-powered receiver on the outskirts of Lynchburg which it used to tune in WLW and re-broadcast the signal to Lynchburg listeners. In December 1935, WLVA moved to a new building in Lynchburg and boasted a \\"selling staff\\" of 12, headed by Glenn E. Jackson. At that time, Jimmy Moore was director of programs; Al Heiser was chief engineer, and Jim Howe was head of continuity. In late 1939, under president Edward A. Allen, WLVA acquired station WBTM (Danville, Virginia). On January 1, 1940, the two joined together to form the fledgling Piedmont Broadcasting System. Each station took turns originating programs that were heard over both simultaneously. The network expanded in late 1940 to include station WSLS (Roanoke, Virginia). When Glenn Jackson, after 13 years at WLVA, killed himself at age 33 on April 9, 1942, the news was reported in Variety Beginning in 1935 and continuing well into the 1950s, WLVA hosted an annual \\"Christmas Party\\" to raise money and clothing for needy children in the area. The all-day broadcast (usually the Sunday before Christmas) featured local performers who stopped by to entertain the listening audience. In between performances, announcers read the names of contributors. In 1942, WLVA's \\"Christmas Party\\" made national news when Byron Price, war censorship chief in Washington, D.C., forbade the station to read the names of donors on-air, fearing that doing so might \\"tipoff, accidentally...enemy agents.\\" On January 1, 1940, after Lynchburg Broadcasting Corporation gained managerial control of WBTM in Danville, Virginia, that station and WLVA began exchanging programs for four hours daily via newly installed lines that connected the two. WLVA radio moved to 590 kHz in 1947. A companion FM station, WLVA-FM on 97.5 MHz, was briefly on the air from February 1952. The license was returned on March 10, 1955, and the 97.5 MHz allocation was occupied several years later by WCCV-FM (now WWWV) in Charlottesville. Until the late 1970s, WLVA had many listeners, but FM radio took away a lot of the audience.Bethany Fuller, \\"WLVA Lands New Owner,\\" The News & Advance, October 8, 2005. During part of the 1990s WLVA was part of the three stations known as \\"The Lake,\\" simulcasting on 106.9 FM and 880AM from Smith Mountain Lake. The format was \\"All the Great Songs,\\" very similar to The Music of Your Life format. For several years during the 1990s, WLVA became a talk-radio station. Most of this programming was lost within a year after WLNI-FM signed-on. In 2005, Truth Broadcasting purchased WLVA from Kovas Communications. The station was off the air at that time. In 2008, Truth Broadcasting, whose president was Stuart Epperson, Jr., announced WLVA's sale to Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting Corp., whose president was Nancy Epperson.\\"Deals,\\" Broadcasting & Cable, December 15, 2008. In 2011, another of Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting's stations, WLES-AM of Bon Air/Richmond started broadcasting on 590 kHz, while the still silent WLVA was given 580 kHz. The WLVA call letters were once attached to WSET-TV, the Lynchburg-based ABC affiliate, which was known as WLVA-TV. As of June 1, 2012, WLVA switched formats from Religious to Oldies/Classic Rock format as \\"QRockRadio\\". In November 2012, WLVA began simulcasting on translator W294BO on 106.7FM from nearby Concord, Virginia. May 31, 2013 was the final day that WLVA and W293BY transmitted QRockRadio. On June 1, 2013, W293BY started simulcasting gospel stations WKBA/WKPA (AM 1550 from Vinton / AM 1390 from Lynchburg). For most of June, WLVA rebroadcast the output of local talk station 1050 WBRG. On September 1, WLVA returned to the air with a Talk format. On February 16, 2014, Chesapeake-Portsmouth Broadcasting sold WLVA to Brent Epperson, at a purchase price of $55,000.

He died in 1983. He appeared in one wartime international for England (against Wales in May 1945) for which caps were not awarded although the England teams then were probably stronger than some pre-war sides. He also played in armed services representative sides which were Great Britain elevens in all but name. According to George Allison, Arsenal's manager, wartime football was 'better in quality than pre-war League football'. After retiring from playing, Smith had a successful career as both an F.A. coach and manager. His league win ratios at Crystal Palace and Portsmouth FC were 43% and 36% respectively. Early playing career Smith's career began at Hackney Schools in east London where he had grown up. He joined the army as a young man and was stationed in Syria and Palestine in the mid-nineteen thirties. On returning to England, he was bought out of the army by Jimmy Seed and, in 1936‚Äì37, began to feature for Bexleyheath & Welling in the Kent League. After promotion with Charlton from the third to the second division in 1935, Seed had arranged that Bexleyheath & Welling would become the nursery club of Charlton Athletic and the amateur team was also referred to as 'Charlton A'. =Charlton Athletic= Under Seed's management, Charlton surprised the football world prior to World War II by achieving successive promotions and becoming one of the strongest teams in the English 1st Division. They were runners-up in 1936-7 and then finished fourth and third respectively before the war caused league football to be abandoned for six years. Smith signed professional papers on 5 August 1938 with a salary of ¬£5 per week and a ¬£10 signing-on payment. His contract was renewed in 1939 at ¬£6 per week until May 1940 with the provision of '¬£1 extra per week when playing in the first team'. He made the first XI at the end of the 1938‚Äì9 season when his form attracted considerable attention. This was the final game of that season at home on 6 May to Preston North End; a game which Charlton won 3‚Äì1. The outbreak of the war meant that he only made 1 full league appearance before regular football fixtures were halted. War years George Smith enlisted in the APTC on 3 November 1939; listing his professions as footballer and PT Instructor. He spent much of the early period of the Second World War as a PT instructor at Aldershot as well as on troop ships. During this period, he continued to represent Charlton Athletic as well as being a wartime playing guest for Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea among others. On 15 April 1944, he played in Charlton's 3‚Äì1 win against Chelsea in the Football League South War Cup Final in front of a crowd of 85,000 at Wembley. In that 1944 final, the players received National Savings Certificates instead of medals. US General Dwight D. Eisenhower was presented to the teams and afterwards was quoted as saying, \\"I started cheering for the Blues but after the Reds took the lead, well I had to cheer for them instead.\\" He was discharged from Victoria Barracks, Windsor, at the rank of sergeant major, with exemplary military conduct on 8 December 1945. His discharge papers read 'an excellent physical training instructor and an international footballer: an honest, sober and trustworthy man with a most cheerful disposition'. =Army & FA representative XIs= During the last years of the war he also played in several strong Army and FA representative sides alongside players such as Frank Swift and Matt Busby, both of whom were friends from their days at Aldershot Army camp. Although these matches were not recorded as official internationals, the players wore England shirts and received notification of their selection on English Football Association headed paper. 'In March 1945, an FA XI played two games in Belgium, against the national side and against the Diables Rouge, the Belgian parachute brigade. The full party was: Bert Williams (Walsall), Laurie Scott (Arsenal), Bert Sproston (Manchester City), George Hardwick (Middlesbrough), Matt Busby (Liverpool), George Smith and 'Sailor' Brown (Charlton Athletic), Stanley Matthews and Neil Franklin (Stoke City), Tommy Lawton and Joe Mercer (Everton), Stan Mortensen (Blackpool), Leslie Smith (Brentford) and Maurice Edelston (Reading). In Bruges, the FA team received a rapturous welcome from thousands of British troops ‚Äì some of whom had torn down a wooden fence to gain admission ‚Äì and went on to win 8‚Äì1.' =Wartime International= George Smith made his one wartime international appearance against Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff on 5 May 1945. England won 3‚Äì2 with a hat-trick by Raich Carter. He had also been reserve for England against Scotland at Hampden on 14 April after returning from the FA XI trip to Belgium. Later playing career =Brentford F.C.= After the war, in November 1945, he was placed on the Charlton transfer list, at his own request, and on 19th of that month, moved to Brentford for a ¬£3,000 transfer fee. The reason was given as 'domestic' in some newspapers and as 'a disagreement on certain issues' by Jimmy Seed. He made 41 league appearances for the Bees before moving to Queens Park Rangers in May 1947. The move was precipitated by Brentford's 'Put Football First' policy to ban any outside employment which cut across 9‚Äì12 morning training sessions. Brentford manager, Harry Curtis, stated that the 'usual team spirit was lacking' as players missed training and team talks. Smith worked as a physical education teacher at St. Joseph's College, Beulah Hill and was unwilling to meet the club's requirements. He was joined in this decision by other players including Scotland right-half, Archie Macaulay, and Len Townsend, the club's centre-forward and leading scorer who also left. =Queens Park Rangers= Brentford transferred Smith to QPR for a fee reputed to be a record for a third division club which according to press reports of the time 'the Rangers do not regret spending one penny of'. Smith described it as a 'good change for me. Brentford was not a happy club'. He captained Queens Park Rangers to a Division III South Champions medal in May 1948. QPR also reached the 6th round of F.A. Cuphttp://www.britishpathe.com/video/queens- park-rangers-1-derby-county-1 in his 'happiest season in football, not only because it was so successful but because of great team spirit shown by all the players of the club'. In total, he played 75 league games for them. In August 1949, prior to Smith's departure from Loftus Road, the QPR boss, David Mangnall, wrote to Smith, 'you deserve most of the credit for our promotion, also for pulling us through last season, we noticed that you kept cool and calm about it all, and as a result our worry never entered the dressing room'. End of playing career & early coaching On 26 September 1949, he joined Ipswich Town where he made 8 league appearances and became the club's assistant manager and coach until his resignation in January 1950. This signalled the start of his own managerial career. He moved to Chelmsford City in August 1950, then Redhill in July 1951, and Eastbourne United from 1952‚Äì55. This was a successful period for the club as, under Smith's guidance, they were twice County League champions, and runners-up once between 1953 and 1956. =F.A. Youth coach= During this period he became the first paid F.A. Youth Squad manager of the England national team attending and participating in coaching sessions at Lilleshall. From September 1955 until February 1956 he was coach at Sheffield United. Management =Sutton United= In 1956, Sutton United were looking for a new manager and long-serving club president (at that time, chairman), Andrew Letts recalls that Smith was recommended to the club by Tottenham manager, Arthur Rowe. He was appointed after interview on 26 May 1956 to take up duties on 1 July and steered the club through one of its happiest periods. In his second season of 1957‚Äì58, the club won both the Athenian league and the London Senior Cup; the former for the final time in the club's history and the latter for the first time. Although committed to a 4-year contract, success brought an offer of professional management from Crystal Palace and Sutton agreed to let Smith go, eventually replacing him with Malcolm Allison. Andrew Letts wrote of George Smith in the Sutton United Football Club 1898‚Äì1973 ‚Äì 75th Anniversary Souvenir Book: 'We had two very happy years, under inspired leadership, and had been left with a great example. I understand how the players felt for he lifted me, just as he lifted the game and them, to a different level, and I, like them shall always be grateful to him.' =Crystal Palace= In July 1958, he took over as manager of Crystal Palace in the newly formed fourth division. When he took the Crystal Palace job he said he would resign if he did not achieve promotion within two years. He did not and subsequently kept his word; resigning in April 1960. However, he left a team good enough to win promotion for his successor. George Smith returned to Sheffield United as coach from April 1960 until April 1961. =Portsmouth FC= He then began his decade as Portsmouth FC manager from April 1961 until April 1970. When he joined them, Portsmouth was in the third division but he won promotion to the Second Division by winning the Third Division Championship in 1962. Field-Marshal the Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, was the honorary chairman of Portsmouth FC having begun to support them during World War II due to the proximity of his headquarters. In private correspondence dated 25 April 1962, he wrote to Smith: 'I congratulate you very much on getting Portsmouth out of the Third Division ‚Äì which was completely a wrong place for a famous team. While the players all did their stuff, the major credit goes to you.' Throughout the sixties, on a limited budget, he kept Portsmouth on a sound financial footing in the second division. In 1970, he became Portsmouth FC general manager until his retirement from football in 1973. Retirement He moved to Bodmin in Cornwall for the last years of his life and died in 1983.

Biography =Early life and career= Lovemore Tshuma gave birth to Majaivana in Gwelo (now Gweru). At the age of four, Majaivana's family moved to Bulawayo where he sang in the church choir where his father was minister. By the age of 15 he became a drummer in a local Bulawayo band, the Hi-Chords. After moving to the capital city, Salisbury (now Harare) he gave up drumming and began singing in nightclubs covering Tom Jones and Elvis Presley songs. After playing in Bulawayo for four years, he returned to Salisbury and formed his own band, Jobs Combination named after Job's Nightclub (owned by then businessman Job Kadengu) where the group was the resident band. By age of 16 the musician in Lovemore was evident. Majaivana and his friend Mtshapi! A neighbor, built their own first set of drums from plastics and empty cardboard barrels cut in half. They carried these drums all over the local Beer Gardens (Manwele and New Bhawa) in Bulawayo playing to adoring patrons for a meager fee or whatever the patrons saw fit. This brazen effort by Lovemore paid off a year later because Lovemore would be on a real set of drums.off in Bulawayo had young bands in their teens flourishing within the city. There was; the Eye of Liberty(Joseph Msonda), Common Five, Live Wire (Late Jonah Sithole). Love ore became lead singer for the Hi Chords (Benson, lead guitar, Davy, bass Ruben, rhythm and Vivian, drums, later replaced by another teenager Dave. The Hi Chords flourished under a local businessman Mr. Memo. Unlike the other teenagers Memo groomed them and gave them a clean cut image. They wore suits and appeared very professional. That marketing genius by Memo earned the Hi- Chords instant success. They had access to instruments, transportation and good management. Under Memo they travelled extensively in and out of Bulawayo. They played at weddings (Macdonald Hall) the local Boys Clubs. Soon they were playing at bigger venues like the famous Valley Hotel, the Great Northern, Marisha Cocktail Bar and the likes. Lovemore liked to dance also as he sang hence the name Majaivana derivative from the English word \\"jive\\". Early songs covered were teeny-bopper, bubblegum and rock then the Tom Jones ballads. They covered the Beatles, Grassroots, Rolling Stones and any top hits between 1968 and 1970. =1974 ‚Äì early 1980s= Jobs Combination involved teaming up with blind singer Fanyana Dube, performing various popular musical idioms. They had several successful singles early on, and their debut album, Isitimela, was a big seller. Despite all this, the band broke up shortly thereafter, and Majaivana sang with the Real Sounds for about two months. =Later career= The turning point in his career came when he joined the Zulus, a band from Victoria Falls which featured two of his brothers. Finally having a stable base from which to work, Majaivana and his band released an album of traditional folk songs, Salanini Zinini, that he and his brothers had learned from their mother in 1984. From then, he progressed away from his former Western influences, and his popularity steadily grew especially in Ndebele speaking Matebeleland and Bulawayo in particular. His first international album was released in 1990. He left Zimbabwe in 2000 and retired from the music business.

Though each EU member state has primary responsibility for the regulation of most matters within their jurisdiction, and consequently each has its own laws, harmonisation aims to: * create consistency of laws, regulations, standards and practices, so that the same rules will apply to businesses that operate in more than one member state, and so that the businesses of one state do not obtain an economic advantage over those in another as a result of different rules. * reduced compliance and regulatory burdens for businesses operating nationally or trans-nationally. An objective of the European Union to achieve uniformity in laws of member states is to facilitate free trade and protect citizens.Peter E Nygh, Peter Butt (ed). (1997). ‚Äò‚ÄôButterworth Australian LEGAL Dictionary‚Äô‚Äô. page 543 Harmonisation is a process of ascertaining the admitted limits of international unification but does not necessarily amount to a vision of total uniformity.Menski, W. (2005). ‚Äò‚ÄôComparative Law in a Global Context‚Äô‚Äô. London: Cambridge University Press. page 39 Characteristics of harmonisation Harmonisation is usually not comprehensive but partial, in that it does not seek to create a sole authority of law on a particular subject. This is because measures to harmonise law cannot go further than that which is necessary.Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Harmonization of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice‚Äô‚Äô. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 49 Harmonisation is unsystematic. The directives of the European Union do not focus on or contain comprehensive regulation of the entire law. The directives regulate some very specific issues and they regulate them only for particular situations or circumstances and only for particular types of parties. This is most prevalent in European Union contract law.Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Harmonization of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice‚Äô‚Äô. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 50 Harmonisation generally takes place on two levels of governance, the overarching body and each of the members individually. Taking the European Union, the two levels are the European level and national level. Although both European and national legislators share the legislative responsibilities, neither of these bodies has final responsibility for the whole. Also, there is no superior political authority which has the final say on who is responsible for what, i.e. no overarching authority over the European and national legislators. The European Court of Justice may however determine the extent of harmonisation when determining cases. Harmonisation is dynamic, in that the instruments of harmonisation aim at change, in particular improving and establishing consistent conditions for the operation of legal principles. Harmonisation versus unification The unification and harmonisation of laws are similar in the sense that both involve approximating several legal systems and both are also oriented towards establishing some level of integration from a previous situation characterized by diversity. On the other hand, unification and harmonisation have different fundamental aims. The former works towards complete unity in substance and detail whereas the latter avoids complete uniformity, and is primarily concerned with approximating the fundamental principles of national laws.Cheng, p. 109. In unification, for example, a new law completely replaces the national laws that have existed before. A harmonisation law on the European level does not exceed mere approximationAndenas & Andersen, p. 309. and leaves the national differences in place as long as they are not expressly regulated by the harmonising law.Cheng, p. 109. Here, national laws merely become closer but not identical. Unification also focuses on substituting or combining two or more legal systems and replacing them with a single system. Harmonisation on the other hand seeks to co-ordinate different legal systems by ‚Äúeliminating major differences and creating minimum requirements or standards‚Äù > ‚ÄúUnlike unification which contemplates the substitution of two or more legal > systems with one single system, harmonisation of law arises exclusively in > comparative law literature, and especially in conjunction with > interjurisdictional, private transactions. Harmonisation seeks to ‚Äòeffect an > approximation or coordination of different legal provision or systems by > eliminating major differences and creating minimum requirements or > standards‚ÄôKamba (1974) 23 ICLQ 485, 501‚Äùde Cruz, P. (1999). ‚Äò‚ÄôComparative > Law in a Changing World‚Äô‚Äô. London: Cavendish Publishing.. Harmonisation can be seen as a step towards unification and, in a way, harmonisation aims or strives towards unification. Efforts to achieve harmonisation Harmonisation is not a new concept. However, the problem is that no harmonisation project has ever reached completion. That is due to the nature of harmonisation, it is designed to incorporate different legal systems under a basic framework. This is the appeal of harmonisation, it takes into account the local factors yet applies general principles to make a consistent framework of law. It generally incorporates local factors under a relatively unified framework.Hesselink, M. The Ideal of Codification and the Dynamics of Europeanisation: The Dutch Experience in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). The Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 48 An example of harmonisation can be drawn from the European Union and the use of Directives. Directives require transposition into the domestic legal system of the Member State in order to become effective. If a Member State fails to transpose the Directive in a timely manner or fails to do it at all, the Directive will take 'direct effect', that is, individuals are able to derive rights from that Directive directly despite not being transposed into domestic law.Francovich and Others [1991] ECR I-5357 A Directive could be transposed through enactment under legislation from the national parliament or through agreement by reference.Ginsburg, T and Cooter RD. \\"Leximetrics: Why the Same Laws are Longer in Some Countries than Others\\" (http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context;=alea), American Law and Economics Association Annual Meetings 2004, Paper 64. 2004. The Directives are flexible to the extent that the national authorities of the Member States have the choice of the form and method of the implementation of the Directive. This takes into account the fact that Member States have differing legal systems.Craig P and de B√∫rca, G. (3rd edn). EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials. Oxford University Press. Page 203. in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). The Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private Laws, Business and Legal Practice. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart Publishing. Page 115 Hence this allows the establishment of a harmonised framework of laws whilst preserving the established national laws of each member. This is the major appeal of harmonisation over unification. Harmonisation can be achieved in two ways, actively or passively. The most common is the active pursuit of harmonisation usually through the enactment of legislation which incorporates the harmonised principles into the local law. Passive harmonisation may occur through non- legislative agreements or a convergence of case law. So far, passive harmonisation is the least successful since the non-legislative agreements tend to be voluntary. The convergence of case law is more promising since: > \\"All that matters is that the courts of different European States achieve > similar results in the same cases, regardless of which norms, doctrines or > procedures they apply in order to reach this end.\\"Colombi Ciacchi, A. \\"Non- > Legislative Harmonisation of Private Law under the European Constitution: > The Case of Unfair Suretyships\\", (2005). 13 European Review of Private Law > page 285 in the book by Vogenauer, S and Weatherill, S (ed). (2006). The > Harmonisation of European Contract Law Implications for European Private > Laws, Business and Legal Practice. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart > Publishing. Page 198 Harmonisation and convergence of law Harmonisation is synonymous with convergence of the law however harmonisation is usually associated via active pursuit through enacting legislation whereas convergence is generally associated with a passive approach such as a natural convergence of law through custom and frequent use of harmonised principles. The most prominent example of harmonisation in international law is UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law).

In addition to individual counseling, classes are offered on strengthening marriage and families, along with the Addiction Recovery Program, which is based on the 12-step model and Christian values. History In 1919, the organization was created as the Relief Society Social Service Department (RSSSD) by Amy B. Lyman, an official in the church's Relief Society organization. In 1969, the organization was renamed Unified Social Services (USS) and separated from the Relief Society. In 1973, the organization became a corporation separate from the church and was renamed LDS Social Services; in 1995, the name was changed to LDS Family Services. In 2019, the name was changed to Family Services. Until 1934, the program only had professional staff in Salt Lake City.

However, in June 2014 the agency announced that it would no longer operate a full-scale adoption agency. Instead, Family Services planned to shift all of its adoption-related resources to counseling for birth parents and prospective adoptive parents and partner with local agencies for services it no longer provided. According to the Deseret News, the agency cited changes in adoption trends such as the reduction in children available for adoption. Family Services has been the subject of lawsuits about fathers' rights in some adoption cases, and other religious-based adoption agencies are under pressure to facilitate adoptions for same-sex couples. But the organization said that none of these issues influenced its decision. Notes References *C.

History  In the aftermath of World War II, when thousands of Jewish survivors arrived in the United States and began the process of rebuilding the dozens of communities which were decimated in the Holocaust, this organization was founded in 1953, with the stated goal of serving as an umbrella rabbinical body to unite the newly transplanted Haredi communities, and to provide said communities with all religious needs. The organization was founded by the rebbe of Satmar, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, alongside Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Greenwald of Tzehlim, Rabbi Yosef Greenwald of Pupa, Rabbi Shimon Yisroel Posen of Shopron, Rabbi Yonasan Steif of Vien, and Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum of Siget, who later assumed the title of rebbe of Satmar. These Rabbis formed the executive board of the organization. The organization established a special panel to maintain and enforce traditional Jewish law, called Vaad L'Chizuk Hadas (in Hebrew: ◊ï◊¢◊ì ◊ú◊ó◊ô◊ñ◊ï◊ß ◊î◊ì◊™), led by Rabbi Rafael Blum of Kashau (Hasidic dynasty), Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein of Krasna, Rabbi Yakov Lebowitz of Kapish, and Rabbi Moshe Bick of Mezhbizh. An advisory board named Vaad L'inyonei Hora'ah (in Hebrew: ◊ï◊¢◊ì ◊ú◊¢◊†◊ô◊†◊ô ◊î◊ï◊®◊ê◊î), was directed by Rabbi Naftali Hertzka Henig of Sharmash. Throughout the years, the organization grew exponentially, and quickly turned into one of the most recognized rabbinical organizations, currently having over 300 communal rabbis as members,Complaint filed 10/11/12 in New York Southern District Court in the CRC et al v.

Currently, the Dean of the Organization is Yitzchak Glick, who has served in this position for over 40 years, assisted by Mattes Berkowitz as secretary, and Chaim Shlomo Ilowitz as Co-Ordinator. Kosher supervision With many Jews arriving from Europe, whose Kashrus standards differed from those generally accepted in America, the need for a kosher certification agency was felt, and the organization established a division to supervise food industry establishments and grant hechshers,[] which was led by Rabbi Yissachar Ber Rottenberg of Wodzislaw and Rabbi Asher Babad of Tartikov. One of the first major Kashrus projects was the founding of a Shechita, to produce poultry and beef in line with the high standards of these communities. This division certifies hundreds of food manufacturing plants, producing thousands of kosher products, as well as many bakeries, catering halls, and eateries, two large poultry plants, and five meat processing plants, employing 50 shochtim (slaughterers), a few dairy farms, and famous wineries. This division, currently the biggest of the organization, consists of a large team of well-trained Mashgichim who travel across the world supervising and certifying the plants and food production facilities, physically monitoring and ensuring that all requirements are met. In 2018, this division expanded and modernized the laboratory with new state-of-the-art machinery and equipment, employing highly skilled professionals in the field of chemical research, analyzing various ingredients to ascertain their Kashrus viability, and analyzing the various plants and seeds for bug infestation. Once a year, prior to Passover, this division published the highly acclaimed Mafteach Ha'Kashrus, which includes all laws relevant to the Passover holiday, and general Kashrus information. Throughout the year, the division publishes a magazine with articles about topics of interest in the field of Kashrus and updates. The Kashrus division is currently headed by the Chief Rabbi of Mount Kisco, New York, Rabbi Hillel Weinberger of Serdahely, who serves as the Chief Justice of said division, Rabbi Yitzchak Menachem Eichenstein of Galanta, and Rabbi Shia Heschel Bick of Mezhbizh. Rabbi Lipa Klein serves as Head Mashgiach, Executive Rabbinic Co-Ordinator. Rabbinical services The organization has a full-service Beth Din, providing arbitration and mediation services mainly in Marital and Business disputes, settling hundreds of cases annually, and co-ordinating tens of Gittin (Jewish divorces). The Beth Din also handles all matters pertaining to Kidushin (Jewish weddings), ensuring the couple is allowed to be married in accordance with Halacha. The Beth Din division is currently headed by Rabbi Mendel Zilber, widely known as the Freimaner Rav, who serves as the Chief Justice, and some of the Dayanim (rabbinical judges) are Rabbi Yitzchak Menachem Eichenstein of Galanta, Rabbi Meshulam Polatchek (Av Beis Din Meged Yehuda in Brooklyn, New York, and Rabbi Abraham Gross. The first Beth Din secretary was Rabbi Shabse Mordche Berkowitz, being replaced after his passing by Rabbi Yishay Buchinger. The organization also maintains, in a separate office, a full-time Beis Hora'ah, with rabbis taking shifts to answer to the public on inquiries in Jewish law, from early morning, until midnight. This division was led for many years by Rabbi Shalom Kraus of Udvari.

He was created a baronet in 1895. = Policies and personality = Forwood was \\"orthodox, a resolute champion of the union and Empire, monarchy and church, Lords and Commons\\", he was concerned that the Conservative leaders were \\"too faint-hearted or stuck up\\", and was worried about the \\"timidity\\" of the Liverpool merchants. He supported the establishment of an episcopal see and a University College in Liverpool and, more generally, advocated universal suffrage, the redistribution of parliamentary seats, temperance reform, comprehensive employers' liability, old age pensions, council housing, public utilities and public transport. When he was a minister, he was described as being \\"a hustler\\" and as having drive as an administrator and reformer, but he did not have \\"the knack of making himself popular\\". His manner was described as being \\"unvarnished\\" and he was \\"short of the instincts of a Gentleman\\". Nevertheless, he was praised for his effectiveness and for his determination.  Personal life  In 1858 Forwood married Lucy, daughter of Simon Crosfield (brother of the businessman Joseph Crosfield), of Liverpool; they had three daughters. Lucy died in 1873, and the following year Forwood married Mary Anne Eliza, daughter of the journalist and historian Thomas Baines, FRS, of Liverpool and of London. They had four sons (the eldest, Dudley, being heir to the baronetcy), and a daughter.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th ed., 2003, vol. 1, p. 1477The Visitation of England and Wales, vol. 15, ed. Frederick Arthur Crisp, 1908, pp. 91-96 Forwood died in September 1898 at his home, The Priory, Gateacre, Liverpool and was buried nearby in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Childwall. He had been suffering from colitis, and this led to heart failure. Forwood's estate amounted to a little over ¬£87,320 (¬£ as of ). His statue stands in St John's Gardens, Liverpool.

The goal of NUSAF is to help local communities in the 18 districts of northern Uganda that have been ravaged by conflict over the last 20 years. This money is given directly to members of the community so they can invest in infrastructure and training for long-term development. Labora Farms is unique in NUSAF as it was the first project started and run entirely by former members of the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group responsible for numerous war crimes over the last 23 years in northern Uganda. While all of the members had either gone through the customary cleansing rituals by their communities or were currently going through them, because of its ties to former enemy combatants, Labora Farms received a very negative reception in the international community. Within the local people and government though there was a lot of support. Today Labora Farms is still receiving mixed praise from all sides, though it has had success in helping former LRA members not only make a living wage, but also for helping them reintegrate into their communities. Using historical newspaper articles and first hand interviews, this article looks at the history of Labora Farms since its controversial inception. This article is organized as follows. The first section is a description of the history of the difficult and protracted conflict in northern Uganda and the effects it has had on the people. Section 3 describes the unique way the Acholi people have of accepting former enemy combatants back into their culture. Section 4 discusses the initial phase of implementation of the Labora Farms project along with the local and international reaction to it. Section 5 discusses the redistribution of land within the farm, why this turned out to be successful, and what the local and international communities are saying about Labora Farms today. Section 6 then discusses some of the future challenges of the project. Northern Uganda conflict Northern Uganda has seen some of the most complex and difficult violence in Africa. From 1994 until 2007 the LRA rebel group abducted approximately 60,000 youth aged primarily 5 to 30 years old to be used in their resistance movement. These youth were often used for short periods of time doing menial tasks such as giving simple directions and carrying supplies. Many of the youth though were used as fighters and sex slaves for the soldiers and were forced to participate in violence against others. Approximately 28% of the males abducted were forced to murder a civilian, with 8% forced to murder a family member. Even among those that were never abducted, 37% of youth males witnessed a killing.Blattman and Annan. 2006. \\"The Consequences of Child Soldiering\\" In addition to the violence most youth experienced, everyone was affected by the government‚Äôs strategy to fight the resistance group. To isolate the fighters, the government forcefully took all of the people in the north from their villages and placed them into internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. The people in the camps had no jobs as they were all trained previously as farmers. They were suddenly without land, with poor access to water, sanitation and health care. In 2007 a serious peace process began, spurred in part by international pressure, impending International Criminal Court (ICC) proceedings on the leaders of the LRA and decreasing support from southern Sudan where the rebels were hiding. With the peace has come a return to the villages for the people, but the return is slow in part because of worries of insecurity and concerns for crop harvests. Acholi cleansing and forgiveness The Acholi people practice a unique system of forgiveness. If a person is truly seeking to be forgiven for past indiscretions, no matter how severe they are, they may begin a process of forgiveness, called mato oput, meaning literally ‚Äúto drink from the tree‚Äù. This process is takes time and culminates in a ceremony where the offending and offended parties drink the waters of a local tree together. Alternatively, a ceremony can be performed where the offender steps on an egg, symbolizing a return to innocence, and then steps over a line, where they are then accepted back into the community. The acceptance is so complete that, after the ceremony, if anyone in the community accuses the person of wrongdoing, it is the accuser that will be tried for offending the community.Peter Amico's Thoughts (blog) The Acholi system of justice is complex and often more violent than this forgiveness ceremony would suggest. People caught committing a crime, such as stealing or murder, often face mob justice and usually end up dead if the police do not arrive fast enough. While this seems like a contradiction from the above description, it is consistent within the community because what really matters is that the offender must ask for forgiveness of their own volition, and not be induced to do so by a fear for their life. Only if the community is satisfied that the offense will never be committed again is the person allowed to ask for mato oput. This system of forgiveness has created a problem within the international community with the recent ICC indictments against the leaders of the LRA. These indictments have met with widespread disapproval from the Acholi people. Many, including local citizens that have faced displacement from the conflict, would prefer the leaders of the LRA instead go through the cleansing ritual and return to their respective communities. Most others would prefer the leaders go through the cleansing ritual, but instead of moving back to the communities find a home in another country. Only a very few support any kind of potential jail sentence for the leaders, given that they ask for forgiveness. This is of course counter to the basic idea of the ICC, which seeks in part to offer a threat to those that are thinking about committing future crimes. When this point was expressed to Ray, a former LRA captain, his response was ‚ÄúWhen did war begin? When will war end?‚Äù Meaning the idea that war can be prevented by making it costly in an abstract sense for people is not going to work. Individual Story: Captain Ray Ray was with the LRA for 18 years and attained the rank of captain before escaping. He was originally abducted while drunk and since returning has not had any alcohol; in his words, ‚ÄúI will die without another drink‚Äù. Like many abductees, after time Ray was given more and more responsibility, eventually moving up the ranks. During his time with the LRA he killed many people, but has since denounced violence. He has gone through the forgiveness ritual and has been accepted back into his community. When he first returned to his community he began a weekly radio address to his former friends in the LRA, telling them about his experiences coming home and asking them to return. Some of those that did return are also working on Labora Farms and have also been able to perform the cleansing rituals. He still faces danger from the LRA though because of his calls for former rebels to return home. He now believes though that ‚Äúputting your life in danger for peace is not a bad thing‚Äù. Initial phase and responses Labora Farms was begun in ‚Ä¶ at the request of ‚Ä¶ There were two main goals for the project initially. The first, and perhaps most important goal, was to offer former LRA members something to do with their time rather than being idle and perhaps likely to cause more problems. In addition, the farm offered a secure place, both financially and physically, for people returning from the rebels, which helped with enticing people to leave the bush. An initial unintended consequence of the project was that it increased local labor demand. Because of the size and complexity of the farm, the project community found it necessary to go to the local community to find additional workers. This had the effect of increasing the wealth of the local people. A new community has since arisen in the area composed of as many as 500 people to work on the farm. Formally the farm was organized as a community based project and was not meant to have any formal hierarchical structure. Initial concerns in the international community about the farm were focused on the fact that, since it was run by a former general in the LRA and staffed entirely by former LRA members, the farm did in fact display a hierarchical structure similar to the command structure the members experience while rebels. This led to such groups as the [Victims Rights Working Group] (VRWG) to express concerns over the fact that the ‚Äúsenior amnestied LRA commanders are in charge [at Labora Farms] and exploit the very women and girls whom they abducted, raped and held in captivity‚Äù.New Vision, 8 September 2006 The national Ugandan newspapers published a number of attacks against the farm, most with quotes exclusively from NGOs. The local response though was quite different. Since all of the people at Labora had either gone through the cleansing rituals or were in the process of going through the rituals, the local people and government were very supportive of the program. [government help] Redistribution and current responses There are differing opinions on the success of Labora Farms. One positive outcome was that it was able to bring the former LRA members back into the community fully through a gradual process. As a first step, it offered a secure setting where people could make a small living. This helped in enticing people to leave the bush and lead to an informal hierarchical structure that kept people in the same position they held in the bush, but without the weapons. This means the farm in fact acted as a transition mechanism from conflict to peace. The next step in the process is that after ‚Ä¶ years, the mission of Labora Farms shifted from a community system to an individual one. In ‚Ä¶ the land was divided among the individuals [was this equal?], which had the consequence of entirely breaking down the hierarchical structure of the farm. Private ownership of resources had the effect of breaking the military structure as people were no longer responsible to a boss or a community system with its informal hierarchy. Individual Story: Keenera Keenera was with the LRA for 5 years before escaping. His choice to leave came in part because of the radio address of Captain Ray. Leaving the LRA though is not an easy thing to do. In his words, ‚Äúif you want to die immediately, you ask to leave‚Äù. As he had been with the rebels for a while, he was trusted to go out for short periods of time. During one of his trips he headed for the town and has not looked back. Initially his return was very difficult. ‚ÄúThose that had children who were abducted understood, while those that did not would point their finger in my face‚Äù. Today though he has been accepted back into his community and has his own plot of land to farm. While he is very poor, he is proud to be working on his own without fear of violence. Lessons learned Labora Farms today is still going strong, though it is not without problems. One criticism of the project is the effect on the women associated with the former LRA members.

Mumble uses a client‚Äìserver architecture which allows users to talk to each other via the same server. It has a very simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. All communication is encrypted to ensure user privacy. Mumble is free and open-source software, is cross-platform, and is released under the terms of the new BSD license.  Channel hierarchy  A Mumble server (called Murmur) has a root channel and a hierarchical tree of channels beneath it. Users can temporarily connect channels to create larger virtual channels. This is useful during larger events where a small group of users may be chatting in a channel, but are linked to a common channel with other users to hear announcements. It also matches team-based first-person shooter (FPS) games. Each channel has an associated set of groups and access control lists which control user permissions. The system supports many usage scenarios, at the cost of added configuration complexity.  Sound quality  Mumble uses the low-latency audio codec Opus as of version 1.2.4, the codec that succeeds the previous defaults Speex and CELT. This and the rest of Mumble's design allow for low-latency communication, meaning a shorter delay between when something is said on one end and when it's heard on the other. Mumble also incorporates echo cancellation to reduce echo when using speakers or poor quality sound hardware.  Security and privacy  Mumble connects to a server via a TLS control channel, with the audio travelling via UDP encrypted with AES in OCB mode. As of 1.2.9 Mumble now prefers ECDHE + AES-GCM cipher suites if possible, providing Perfect Forward Secrecy. While password authentication for users is supported, since 1.2.0 it is typically eschewed in favor of strong authentication in the form of public key certificates.  Overlay  There is an integrated overlay for use in games. The overlay shows who is talking and what linked channel they are in. As of version 1.0, users could upload avatars to represent themselves in the overlay, creating a more personalized experience. As of version 1.2, the overlay works with most Direct3D 9/10 and OpenGL games on Windows and has OpenGL support for Linux and Mac OS X. DirectX 11 game support was later added.  Positional audio  For certain games, Mumble modifies the audio to position other players' voices according to their relative position in the game. This not only includes giving a sense of direction, but also of distance. To realise this, Mumble sends each player's in-game position to players in the same game with every audio packet. Mumble can gather the information needed to do this in two ways: it either reads the needed information directly out of the memory of the game or the games provide it themselves via the so-called link plugin interface. The link plugin provides games with a way to expose the information needed for positional audio themselves by including a small piece of source code provided by the Mumble project. Several high-profile games have implemented this functionality including many of Valve's Source Engine based games (Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch) and Guild Wars 2.  Mobile apps  Mobile apps are available for Mumble, such as Mumble for iOS, Plumble for Android(F-Droid, Google Play, Note: Discontinued in 2016), and Mumla (F-Droid, Google Play).  Server integration  Mumble fits into existing technological and social structures. As such, the server is fully remote controllable over Ice. User channels as well as virtual server instances can be manipulated. The project provides a number of sample scripts illustrating the abilities of the interface as well as prefabricated scripts offering features like authenticating users using an existing phpBB or Simple Machines Forum database. The murmur server uses port 64738 TCP and UDP by default. The port number refers to the address of the reset function on a Commodore 64. An alternative minimalist implementation of the mumble-server (Murmur) is called uMurmur. It is intended for installation on embedded devices with limited resources, such as, for example, residential gateways running OpenWrt.  Server hosting  Like many other VoIP clients, Mumble servers can be both rented or hosted locally. Hosting a Mumble server locally requires downloading Murmur (included as an option in the Mumble installer) and launching it. Configuring the server is achieved via editing the configuration file. The configuration file holds information for the server's name, user authentication, audio quality restrictions, and port. Administrating the server from within requires a user to be given administrator rights, or can also be done by logging into the SuperUser account. Administrators within the server can add or edit rooms, manage users, and view the server's information.

Like most of Madsen's novels it hasn't been published in English. Plot summary The novel's protagonist is Jesper Fegge, a young jazz enthusiast and wannabe writer who after meeting an American woman named Mabel and hitting his head several times loses his unconscious mind.The Ungodly Farce review This means in the book that Jesper can't make any decisions unconsciously anymore and it also gives him the ability to see various outcomes of every decision he makes or doesn't make. So at the beginning of the book he either can take his violin or his typewriter to America because of the size of his bag and this decision affects all his future life. Over the course of the novel Jesper can get married and settle down, found a new religion, get beaten up repeatedly, commit adultery, search for the meaning of life and do various other things. Some of the people with whom he interacts in various paths of his life can also sense their complicated relations with Jesper. In the end he has to choose a path of his life that would do the least harm. Writing style Since the book concerns with alternate possible realities some parts of it can't be read in the traditional order. Several chapters are alternate takes on the same event with different actions from Jesper or other characters. Those are printed either one after another, with Jesper sometimes in the middle of the chapter already deciding that he wouldn't be taking this path, in other cases the variations are printed one next to another in parallel columns or even the versions are mixed between the lines of the text. The most explicit example of parallel stories technique is used in the chapter where Jesper visits a psychologist and splits his story in four different variations. Genre classification Despite the contents which could imply The Ungodly Farce being a science fiction novel, in fact it isn't science fiction at all. It could be better described as a partly comical free jazz piece in the form of novel - with several themes coming up repeatedly in different parts of the novel and transforming into something different again and again. The real jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker and his fictional follower Linus form one of the innumerable subplots of the novel.

Musical influences included Patti Smith, PJ Harvey, The Stooges, and Bj√∂rk. Formation and members The band was made up of lead singer and songwriter Joana Glaza (Joana Mikalauskaitƒó, who has a degree from the University of Vilnius), guitarist Ali, bassist Katie and drummer Louis. Joana is originally from Lithuania, and has always sung in English since she was a child; the rest of the band are English. The band formed in summer 2005 after Joana and Ali met through an advert on Loot. Ali originally suggested the name \\"Joana and the Bitches\\" as a joke, and Joana changed it to \\"Wolf\\" partly due to the use of the wolf in Lithuanian symbolism. The band found new management in 2010, and changed their sound, taking influences from Eastern European folk and classical music. About their influences, Joana says that ‚ÄúI totally like [Kate Bush] but it‚Äôs Wikipedia bullshit again that I‚Äôm really influenced by her.\\" She says that PJ Harvey became an influence after people began comparing them: \\"The last real female influence for me is PJ Harvey ‚Äì I have almost all her records. But only because when we released our first single ‚ÄòPurple Nights‚Äô everyone was comparing me, and our sound to her. I knew a bit about her at the time but I was intrigued and I wanted to get deeper to try to understand the basis of the comparison.\\"  Performances  Katie on bass Joana singing Joana at Guilfest 2011 They began performing in public in September 2005, playing their first gig at a venue called The Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon, London. Since then, they have played at many well-known London venues, including The Spitz, Barfly, 100 Club, Purple Turtle, Luminaire, The Enterprise, Water Rats, Hoxton Bar & Kitchen, Proud Gallery, Metro, Ghetto, Favela Chic, Rhythm Factory (supporting Babyshambles), the Dublin Castle, and Koko. Joana prefers playing in East London, particularly at Favela Chic. She says that after the fire at Camden Market, Camden is a \\"tourist haunt\\". The group toured in July / August 2006 to promote their single \\"Purple Nights\\", playing venues in Nottingham, Middlesbrough, Hull and London, as well as supporting James Dean Bradfield at his solo gig at ULU on 11 July 2006. The tour culminated in an appearance at Bestival on the Isle of Wight in September 2006. Joana and the Wolf also played in Brighton in summer 2006 as part of The Great Escape Festival, supporting The Bees. Following the gig, they were offered a live session on John Kennedy's Xfm show, which was recorded and broadcast later in 2006. Joana took her bandmates to her home country for the first time on 25 August 2007 for Be2Gether, a new music festival in South Eastern Lithuania. They played alongside Therapy?, The Young Knives and Bloodhound Gang. In 2009, they played The Big Chill festival and performed twice at London's Lovebox Festival in July 2010. Releases Following a gig at Water Rats in King's Cross, members of Kasabian who were in attendance invited Joana to record a guest vocal on their single (and title track of their second album), \\"Empire\\". The band released a single, \\"Purple Nights\\", on 14 August 2006. It was produced by Jim Abbiss, who had previously worked with Arctic Monkeys and Editors. With the track \\"November\\", it was released on 7\\" vinyl and iTunes by Regal Records (an offshoot of Parlophone), the first release of the Regal Singles Club. In summer 2009, \\"Natural Born Killers\\" was released on iTunes, backed with \\"Demon's Bride\\". \\"Hide Me\\" was released as a download-only single on 3 May 2011, backed with \\"Vagabond Song\\", available on iTunes and Amazon.com.  Songs  The band's repertoire includes: Hide Me; Vagabond Song; Demon's Bride; Isabella; Sleepwalker; Big Black Bird; Dead or Alive; Do Ya?; Entertainer; Frankie; Greedy Thoughts; Kingdom; Kitty; London Baby; Mia; November; Pablo; Patience; Purple Nights; She Will Die; Tiger; Vicious Circles; Wild Dogs; Witch Hunt  Reception  In 2006, the band won a vote on Steve Lamaqc‚Äôs 6 Music Rebel Playlist. On 15 May 2007, the band received an award at the inaugural Indy Music Awards, which was created to support and recognise independent bands and venues in London. They won in their category of \\"Best New Wave/Progressive Act\\" and followed the win with a performance of their song \\"Pablo\\". They were also nominated in 2008. Joana has received media attention in Lithuania, including appearing in Lithuanian Cosmopolitan magazine. The band's music was also played on Lithuanian national radio leading up to their appearance at a festival in 2007.

He represented Lambton West in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1902 to 1919 as a Conservative member. Hanna served as Acting Premier of Ontario from 25 September 1914 to 2 October 1914, after the death of Sir James Whitney, before Sir William Hearst. Background He was born in Adelaide Township, Middlesex County, Canada West, the son of George Hanna and Jane Murdock, and moved to Brooke Township in Lambton County with his family in 1871. He attended Sarnia Collegiate Institute and, after graduating, taught at a primary school near his home for three years. He then studied law at Osgoode Hall in Toronto, Ontario, was called to the bar in 1890 and set up practice in Sarnia. He married Jean Gibson Neil in 1891, in Point Edward, Ontario. They had one son, William Neil. He then married Maud MacAdams, in Sarnia, Ontario in 1896 after the death of his first wife. In 1908, Hanna was named King's Counsel. He served as counsel and director for the Imperial Oil Company in Sarnia. Politics Hanna was unsuccessful in the federal elections of 1896 and 1900 before being elected to the provincial assembly in 1902. He served as Provincial Secretary and Registrar from 1905 to 1916. In 1915, Hanna initiated an overhaul of Ontario's prison systems, closing down facilities which treated prisoners harshly, and took special interest in improving the operations of prisons in Ontario to be more humane. This legacy remains in Toronto's Liberty Village whose name comes from the neighbourhood's main road, Liberty Street, near the former site of Toronto's Central Prison, which was closed by Hanna. In 1916, Hanna introduced the Ontario Temperance Act which prohibited the sale of alcohol except for medicinal purposes or use in church services for the remainder of World War I. Hanna also served as an adviser to prime minister Robert Laird Borden. In 1917, he was named food controller for Canada, charged with dealing with food shortages and inflation near the end of the war. He resigned from his position in January 1918 due to poor health. However, he became president of Imperial Oil later that year. Near the end of 1918, the Hanna family had been shaken by the death in Italy of his son, William Neil, a Royal Air Force lieutenant. Hanna went south for the winter to deal with the shock and his own failing health. While in Augusta, Georgia, he suffered a stroke and died. Following a Methodist service, he was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Sarnia. Legacy Hanna Avenue in Liberty Village, site of the Central Prison for which he closed, is named in his honour.

The artistic element of cookie making also can be traced back to Medieval Germany where Lebkuchen was crafted into fancy shapes and decorated with sugar. The story of \\"Hansel and Gretel \\" published with Grimm's Fairy Tales in 1812 inspired German gingerbread cookie Christmas cards. Also during the 17th century, Dutch and German settlers introduced cookie cutters, decorative molds, and festive holiday cookie decorations to the United States. Today cookie decorating traditions continue in many places in the world and include such activities as cookie decorating parties, competitions, creating cookie bouquets and cookie gift baskets, and simply decorating cookies with children as a fun family activity. Glaze, royal icing and fondant are all popular choices for decorating cookies. History One of the earliest recorded forms of cookie decorating is the springerle, and the oldest known springerle mold is housed at the Swiss national museum in Zurich, Switzerland. This round- shaped mold was carved from wood in the 14th century and pictures the Easter Lamb. A springerle mold or press (carved rolling pins) is used to imprint a picture or design on to a cookie. These cookies have been the traditional Christmas cookies in Bavaria and Austria for centuries. To add to the decorative effect, the designs may be colored with food coloring, or when used for decorative purposes only, with tempera or acrylic paints. Springerle cookies originally displayed biblical scenes and were used to teach the illiterate about the Bible. Eventually, the cookies were decorated with secular scenes depicting images of life events, such as marriages and births.Springerle Food historians also trace the artistic element of cookie making back to Medieval Germany where Lebkuchen (gingerbread) was crafted into fancy shapes and decorated with sugar. However, the Lebkuchen guilds only permitted professional gingerbread bakers to make this, with the exceptions of Christmas and Easter when anyone was free to make their own. The first gingerbread man may have been a Renaissance Man! This cookie is often credited by food historians to Queen Elizabeth I, who during her reign (1558 to 1603) gifted VIP visitors to the court with gingerbread cookies decorated in their likenesses. These gingerbread \\"portraits\\" were decorated with cloves dipped in gold. During the 17th century, guild employed master bakers and artisans created intricate works of art with their gingerbread houses and cookies. It was also during this period in Germany when cookies, in the form of Lebkuchen, were introduced as Christmas decorations. In 1812, Grimm's Fairy Tales was published, and the tale of \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" inspired 19th century bakeries to add to their fanciful gingerbread entourage, decorated gingerbread cookie Christmas cards and finely detailed molded cookies. Tinsmiths rose to the call and crafted cookie cutters into all imaginable forms for bakeries and homemakers who relished having unique cookie cutters. Many a Victorian Christmas tree was adorned with decorated cookies in the shapes of animals and gingerbread men. Also during the 17th century, Dutch and German settlers introduced cookie cutters, decorative molds, and festive holiday decorations to the United States. Gingerbread was likely the first U.S.-made Christmas cookie. Sugar cookies, one of the most widely decorated of cookies today, evolved from the English. The German cookie cutters produced more stylized cookies, many with secular Christmas subjects, and for less cost, than the local American tinsmiths. When import laws opened the floodgates to low-cost, German-imported cooking utensils, including cookie cutters, between 1871 and 1906, the American tradition of decorating cookies for Christmas tree ornamentation took hold. In response to this cookie cutter boom, U.S. published cookbooks began featuring cookies in decorative shapes such as bells and Santa Clauses.The Christmas Cook: Three Centuries of American Yuletide Sweets Harper Perennial:New York, 1990 Today cookie decorating traditions continue in many places in the world and include: decorating cookies for Christmas and other holidays, cookie decorating parties, decorating cookies for cookie bouquets and gift baskets, trimming the Christmas tree with decorated cookies, and decorating cookies with the children, to name a few. Cookie decorating events can even be found at history and art museums. And they are frequently found at holiday events, community centers and classrooms. Decorated cookies also win ribbons at county and state fairs. Cookie cutters Many decorating techniques used today do not require elaborate cookie cutters. The simplest of shapes can be quite versatile in serving various themes. For example, a star-shaped cutter can be used for Christmas, 4 July, and messages of congratulations. A circle can be decorated as a sun, ball, flower, spider web, or smiley face. But some occasions call for special cookie cutters, even custom-made ones. For example, in honor of a 50th wedding anniversary, a photograph of the couple's first car could be sent to a company, and the cutter would be custom made to depict this. Then, the person making the cookies would decorate them to complete the depiction. Icing Royal icing is often used to decorate cookies because it dries hard. At the White House 2005 Christmas, Thaddeus DuBois, the White House Executive Pastry Chef at that time, decorated snowflake cookies with brushed and piped royal icing. In this case, as with many of the decorated cookies Dubois made for the president, his family and their guests, the traditional royal icing was used, a mixture of raw egg whites, powdered sugar, and a drop of lemon juice. Due to health issues with raw egg consumption, such as salmonella, an egg-free variation of royal icing is sometimes alternatively used by decorators. Meringue powder is used instead of the egg whites to create stiffness. Pasteurized refrigerated egg whites are sold at grocery stores for a safer traditional recipe. A sugar glaze made without egg whites and consisting of powdered sugar, water, corn syrup and flavoring (such as almond) is another popular choice for decorating cookies. To decorate a cookie with glaze, an outline is piped just inside the edge of the cookie. Then the design is filled by piping a line of glaze back and forth across the cookie, while staying within the boundaries of the outline.Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2 , 2006. The glaze must be applied quickly because royal icing crusts quickly, but it needs to be moist enough for the piped lines to melt into each, so that the design is smooth. When the icing may crust faster than a design can be filled, the design can be blocked off first into smaller sections. To block off the design, cookie decorators pipe the outline of the cookie as usual, but then section it off in smaller sections, filling them in one at a time. Empty nooks and crannies that the decorating tip didn't pipe into can be filled by carefully dragging a toothpick through the icing into any empty spaces. Cookies can be decorated with more than one color of icing. This is accomplished by allowing the first color to dry completely (often for as long as 2 hours) before adding the second color of icing. While the goal is usually to keep the colors separated when filling in a design on a cookie with icing (such as the white of Santa's beard from the red of his suit), sometimes the colors or bled together on purpose to create a design such as a spider web design. First a white outline is piped and filled in with white. Then using the black icing, a spiral from the center to the outer edge is piped. The web is created by dragging a toothpick in a straight line from the center across the spiral to the outer edge. The more lines, the more intricate the web. decorating bags,one filled with white icing and another with black, and both fit with small round tips. Fondant Fondant is another type of icing that is used to decorate cookies. Fondant can be colored by kneading the coloring into the dough. It can be rolled out, and then cut in shapes to match the cookies or their designs. Fondant can be purchased ready-made; however it is not favored for its taste. A homemade fondant that is often praised for its taste and function is marshmallow fondant, which is also used by cake decorators for covering cakes. When rolling fondant, a silicone mat or parchment will eliminate the need for dusting the rolling surface with powdered sugar, and this will make it easier to lift and transfer the cut pieces to the cookies. The rolled out fondant may be cut into shapes with the same cookie cutters used to cut the cookies. Once cut out, the fondant is placed on top of the cookie. Some types of fondant will adhere right away to the cookie. If the fondant doesn't stick well, the cookie surface may be brushed with a little vanilla extract, corn syrup or piping gel to provide more sticking power. Fondant covered cookies, just like plain or icing covered cookies, lend themselves well to embellishments such as silver dragees and other shiny decorations. Tweezers can be a great help in positioning the tiny ornaments. Decorating the fondant An impression mat can be used with fondant to add design and/or texture. First the fondant is rolled out and then the mat is placed face down on the fondant. Finally, by gently but firmly going over the mat with the rolling pin, the impression is made in the fondant. Then the shapes are cut out. For example, to create a lace heart, a patch of white fondant is rolled out first on a silicone mat. Then an embossed fondant roller is slowly rolled across the surface of the fondant. A heart shaped cookie cutter is used to cut out the fondant hearts. The heart shaped fondant is then peeled off the silicone mat carefully so as not to mar the embossed design. Next, the fondant is trimmed and placed on top of the cookie. Finally the fondant-covered cookie may be brushed with a light dusting of pearl luster dust. Many of the same decorations used by cake decorators are also used on cookies. Sprinkles, as dragees, colored sugars, beads, non- pareils and finely chopped nuts, as well as more expensive decorations like edible gold leaf, are used to decorate cookies. Edible silver and gold The silver and gold covered Drag√©es and other silver and gold cake and cookie decorations sometimes used have not been FDA approved in the United States. Some of these have been approved for human consumption in other countries, such as Easy Leaf's edible gold and silver in Italy. Edible gold and silver have been used for centuries to garnish foods and drinks. The precious metals come in sprinkles, small flakes and leaves and are available at specialty stores and online. However this usage is controversial. According to The Washington Post, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff expert said that edible gold and silver had not gone through pre-market safety evaluations at the FDA \\"because no one has sought pre-market approval.\\" The Washington Post article also reported the expert (who reportedly spoke only on the condition of anonymity) as saying he had not taken a position on edible metals, that they pass right through the body, and are \\"an expensive way to throw away gold.\\" Tobias Freccia, founder of an edible gold retail website, was also quoted in the article saying a \\"book of 500 gold leaves may cost $495, but a 100 mg shaker of the precious metals sells for $19.95.\\" References Cookies Food and drink decorations ","title":"Cookie decorating"},{"id":"12850320","text":"The FPS Social Security and Public Institutions of Social Security (, , ), more commonly known as the FPS Social Security, is a Federal Public Service of Belgium.

The station was between Pigeon Bush and Summit stations on the Wairarapa Line. The station was bypassed when the Rimutaka Tunnel was opened. This station existed solely for the operational requirements of the Incline. It did not consign goods, or serve any local settlements, save for the railway staff that were based there.  History  Though the origin of the name Cross Creek has not always been clear, it is generally accepted based on the writings of surveyor John Rochfort that it was derived from a Mr. Lot Cross, who lived and farmed in the vicinity of the site that was later to become the station. In the early days of the railway, it was known as Cross's Creek, but was simplified to Cross Creek in the 1880s. = Construction = Construction of the station was included in the Incline Contract for the Rimutaka Incline, which was to cover formation works from south of the Summit Tunnel to Featherston. It was awarded to contractor Charles McKirdy for the sum of ¬£49,029 on 5 October 1875. The station started out with a simple yard layout that included; the safety siding, two loops with capacities of 20 and 26 wagons, and a two road engine shed at the south end. The insufficiency of this arrangement soon became apparent, and additional sidings were laid. Increasing use of the line prompted periodic additions of sidings to the yard as required, with the ultimate capacity being reached in 1915. A coal storage shed was attached to the locomotive shed, which was extended in 1882 using materials from the dismantled Kaitoke goods shed. In 1889, the locomotive shed was extended, but by 1899 operational requirements meant that further storage space was required. With insufficient room to extend the locomotive shed on its existing site, a new four-road depot was constructed ‚Äì with a fitter's workshop attached to the western side ‚Äì at the north end of the yard. The Locomotive Foreman's office was built in 1914 on a bank above the engine shed. A coaling stage was provided alongside one of the roads to the engine shed, from which coal was shovelled into the Fell locomotives. A shelter and pit were installed on a nearby siding which was used for changing the brake blocks on the Fell brake vans. The only amenities provided for passenger traffic through the station was a small shelter shed and an office for the traffic staff. There were quite a few houses, these generally being reserved for management or staff with families, especially after the construction in the early 1900s of a dormitory for single members of staff. The station also boasted a school and swimming pool to cater for the children living there. = Operations = Cross Creek station railway yards, with long goods train carrying sheep and railway houses on the right of the railway track, 1910s Cross Creek always had locomotives based there including, until 1880, the four Fell locomotives plus two others. After the closure of the locomotive shed at Featherston in 1891, all locomotives working the South Wairarapa district ‚Äì except for the Greytown Branch ‚Äì were based at Cross Creek. A new engine shed was constructed at Cross Creek in 1899. Because of the maintenance requirements of the Fell locomotives, and the distance of the station from the Petone Workshops, it was necessary to maintain a workshop on site and to have a fitter permanently based there. In 1902, the promotion of a fitter to the position of Assistant Locomotive Foreman for Cross Creek, subordinate to the Locomotive Foreman of Wellington, effectively meant that there were two fitters based at Cross Creek. A third fitter was appointed in 1911, and remained until a reduction in traffic over the line, probably after World War I. The workshops were attached to the side of the locomotive stables, and were capable of handling all but the heaviest of repair and maintenance jobs. Records show that it was normal practice for one of the six Fell locomotives to be away at Petone Workshops for medium to heavy repairs or maintenance at any given time. Cross Creek was one of the first stations on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with the Working Timetable of 1887 being the first to list them. Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. There were two safety sidings, each of which had a ground disc to indicate its position. A home signal was also installed at the foot of the incline, and a starting signal controlled trains leaving for Featherston at the other end of the yard. Though there was a building next to the station in which a lever frame was used to set some points using mechanical interlocking, this was never as extensive as at other stations. Cross Creek had an unusual six-lever partially-interlocked signalling installation and had no \\"distant\\" signals so had points indicators which applied to the \\"main\\" line (see book for station layout), while Summit had a fully interlocked 27-lever frame. An instruction issued in 1885 regarding the use of the safety siding at Cross Creek stated that the points from the Incline must always be set to the safety siding. When a descending train approached Cross Creek, the driver of the leading locomotive gave one long whistle to signal that the train was under control, whereupon the signalman set the points for the arrival road. If there was a problem, the driver had to sound three short whistle blasts in rapid succession, at frequent intervals. No such emergency is known to have occurred. = Demise = In considering alternatives for a railway between the Hutt Valley and the Wairarapa district to bypass the increasingly costly Rimutaka Incline, various proposals for a tunnel were considered that would have involved an eastern portal emerging at Cross Creek. Despite all the work done on investigating these ideas, the alignment eventually chosen was one that saw the tunnel emerging into the Wairarapa in a gully to the north. Once work commenced on the Rimutaka Tunnel, the fate of Cross Creek was sealed. The last train through the station was the Wellington-bound Carterton Show Day excursion on Saturday, 29 October 1955. It carried most of the inhabitants of Cross Creek to a farewell party at Summit, after which they were returned home in a couple of carriages that had been delivered earlier in the day. The station was closed by the following day along with the rest of the line over the Remutaka Ranges. By March 1956 most of the track between Summit and Pigeon Bush had been lifted and the buildings were sold on site for removal.  Today  Cross Creek became part of the Remutaka Rail Trail, which was established and is maintained by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, and was opened on 1 November 1987. Some remnants of the sites former usage remain, most notably the concrete foundations of the locomotive shed, the pit in which the brake blocks for the Fell brake vans were replaced, and the turntable pit. For the benefit of hikers the Conservation Department erected a shelter shed when preparing the site for the rail trail, and have since installed several plaques that point out and describe various features of the yard.  Future  The Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust plans to reinstate and operate a heritage railway between Maymorn and Featherston on the original Wairarapa Line railway formation over the Remutaka Ranges. Stage 3 of the project involves construction and operation of the Incline section between Summit and Cross Creek using Fell locomotives and brake vans.

The Encyclopedia of Mormonism states: > The purposes of LDSSA are to help college and university students stay > closely affiliated with the Church, succeed in their studies, and achieve a > balanced educational-social life while on campus; to motivate LDS students > to become a powerful influence for good on the campus; to provide meaningful > activities that are consistent with Church standards; and to coordinate > Church-related activities for college students. Each chapter of the LDSSA is affiliated with a post-secondary educational institution and the LDS Church. Membership is open to all students enrolled at the institution who espouse the purposes and standards of the LDSSA. Associate membership may be granted to non-students under special circumstances. Membership is not denied to anyone on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, color, age, gender, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, veteran status, or disability. Some institute locations offer classes for students with learning disabilities or other special needs. Members must keep LDSSA standards at LDSSA-sponsored events, which are the standards of the LDS Church. These standards include, but are not limited to: no acts of sexual immorality, no alcohol consumption or tobacco usage, and no immodest attire.For the Strength of Youth, churchofjesuschrist.org. History The LDSSA was established in 1960, and today a chapter of the LDSSA exists in many locations where an Institute of Religion of the Church Educational System has been established. The Institute of Religion Advisory Council, with counsel from the faculty advisor(s), provide advice/guidance to the LDSSA and its members. One of the first LDSSA chapters was organized at the Logan Institute of Religion located adjacent to Utah State University. LDSSA chapters at some schools (for example, Harvard College) are not formally and directly governed by the LDS Church, as a result of official school requirements mandating the \\"local autonomy\\" of recognized campus organizations. However, they still interact with the local Institutes of Religion and church organization structure in ways similar to those of other LDSSA chapters. One key difference is that such LDSSA chapters hold elections for their president and other board officers, rather than those officers being nominated by the Institute of Religion Advisory Council. Two key figures in establishing the LDSSA were W. Rolfe Kerr and Elaine A. Cannon.

Life Richard was born Heinz Wolfgang Richard Sonnenfelt in 1923 to Jewish parents, Walther and Gertrud (Liebenthal) Sonnenfeldt, in Gardelegen. He was eventually driven from his homeland by the harshness of the Nuremberg Laws. In 1938, his mother was able to deliver Richard and his brother Helmut to Bunce Court, a boarding school in England. After Germany attacked England in 1940, he was interned in England as an enemy alien. Sonnenfeldt was sent to a prison in Australia, then released. On arrival in Australia he gave his name as Wolfgang Heinz Israel Sonnenfeldt.Alien registration records NAA:MP1103/1 E40691 \\"Prisoner of War/Internee: Sonnenfeldt, Heinz Wolfgang\\", NAA:MP1103/2 E40691 \\"Prisoner of War/Internee; Sonnenfeldt, Wolfgang Heinz Israel\\". National Archives of Australia. He emigrated to India and then the United States, arriving in April 1941 and reunited with his family in Baltimore. (His brother, Helmut, not treated as an enemy alien because he was under age 16, obtained passage from England to the U.S. Their parents escaped from Germany to Sweden and made it from there to the U.S.) In the U.S., Sonnenfeldt finished high school, was drafted into the U.S. Army, and became a U.S. citizen. He was then sent back to Europe as a U.S. soldier. In 1945 following the Battle of the Bulge, he was in combat action. In April 1945, he briefly entered the liberated Dachau concentration camp in Germany and saw many dead bodies and near-dead survivors. After Germany's surrender, he was working in an Army motor pool in Austria when General William J. (\\"Wild Bill\\") Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), recruited Sonnenfeldt to be his personal interpreter because he spoke both German and English fluently. Donovan soon became the first deputy of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, who had been appointed by President Truman to serve as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. Sonnenfeldt moved with Donovan into that project, first to Paris and then to Nuremberg. In 1946, Sonnenfeldt left Nuremberg and the Army and returned to the United States. He studied electrical engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, graduating first in his class. In his subsequent careers, he was part of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) team that invented color television, involved in work for NASA on the moon landings, a senior executive at the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the dean of a business school, and inventor and holder of many patents, among other things. Sonnenfeldt's memoirs, first published in Germany, were published in English in 2006 as Witness to Nuremberg (Arcade Publishing). Sonnenfeldt was interviewed for the 2006 BBC docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial and many other documentaries.

It is used primarily for flight training, touring and personal flying. Design and development The Ikarus C42 is a single-engined high-wing monoplane with side-by-side seats for two in a wide cabin. The C42 is manufactured with either an Rotax 912 engine or a Rotax 912s engine. The Rotax engine has a low fuel consumption and relatively low noise. The engine drives the propeller, which has ground-adjustable pitch, through a gearbox with a 2.273:1 reduction ratio. Ikarus C42 The aircraft is structurally supported by a backbone of large diameter aluminium tube which runs the length of the aircraft. The cabin and fuselage shell is a composite material which, being non-structural, can be removed for inspection and repair. The wings are constructed of tubular front and rear spars. The wings and flying control surfaces are covered in Kevlar/Mylar/Polyester laminate. The wings can be removed or folded (if an optional folding kit is installed) for storage and transportation. The wing tips are of composite construction which reduces drag and improves low speed handling. Access to the cabin is provided by two gull-wing doors. =Controls= C42 controls and instrument panel A single centre stick controls the ailerons and elevators. Electrical pitch trim is controlled by two buttons on the top of the stick, operated by the thumb. A push to talk button is on the front of the stick, operated by the index finger, together with a vertical hand-operated brake lever similar to a motorcycle front brake lever. Rudder pedals are dual control. The distance from the seat to the pedals is fixed because the seat position is not adjustable. Ikarus C42 ultralight of Airbourne Aviation arrives at the 2018 RIAT, England The dual control throttle levers are situated between the legs, and pivot from side to side so can be folded out of the way making entry and exit of the aircraft easier. The flaps are controlled by a centrally-mounted lever on the roof of the cabin. The relatively short lever does make the operation of lowering flaps quite physical when combined with holding the centre control stick at the same time. Aerotowing In conjunction with a Rotax 912 ULS, the Ikarus C42 may be used to tow gliders. The maximum nominal ultimate strength at weak link must not exceed 660 pounds. Banner towing is allowed with the smaller Rotax 912 UL. Variants ;C42B :Updated model for the US light-sport aircraft category. ;C42C :Introduced in 2012, this model is an update of the basic design with composite parts, winglets, aileron spades, reduced wingspan and a Flettner rudder as well as a new engine mount design derived from the C52. ;C42CS :Introduced in 2015 at the AERO Friedrichshafen show, it incorporates a new landing gear design consisting of a single curved composite gear main leg per side, new brake design and a redesigned interior.

Format The race is held over the course of three days, and is divided into three legs, each starting on consecutive days. In the first leg competitors sail from Penzance to St Mary's, the largest of the Isles of Scilly, then the following day they race in a circuit around the islands. The third and final day sees the fleet return to Penzance. The overall winner of the race is presented with the Manzi Trophy, named after Mike Manzi, the local jeweller who made it. A second trophy, the Venus Trophy, is won by the crew which wins the second leg. History The race is hosted by Penzance Sailing Club and has been run annually since 1978. The first race was organised on behalf of the yacht club by Richard Wood, Brian Saunders and Colin Harrison, who saw the result of their preparations realised when the first race took place in August 1978. For the first two years the race took place on a single day, with the competitors starting at Penzance, before heading out to cardinal marks at Lowlee and Mountamopus. The crews then travelled south of the Wolf Rock Lighthouse, completed a lap of the Isles of Scilly, passed to the south of the lighthouse again, before finally returning to the starting point at Penzance. This course was used again in 1979, and a third time for a race in 2008 called PASAB 1. This was run in addition to the regular PASAB to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the race. In 1980 the race was split into two legs, allowing the crews to have an overnight rest on the Scillies. This format was used a second time in 1982, before in 1993 the current three-legged format was adopted.

The first bone remains were found and collected in 1995 by Brazilian paleontologist William Nava, in red rocks from the fossiliferous Adamantina Formation.Mariliasuchus at Fossilworks.org Four years later, it was described as Mariliasuchus amarali, by Brazilian paleontologists Ismar de Souza Carvalho and Reinaldo J. Bertini. Its type species M. amarali, in honour of S√©rgio Estanislaw do Amaral, Brazilian naturalist. A second species, M. robustus, was named in 2007.pdf  Discovery  Several specimens of M. amarali have been found close to eggs, eggshells and coprolites to date: UFRJ DG 50-R (holotype): a partially complete and articulated skeleton, including a nearly complete skull and partially preserved axial and appendicular skeletons. It belongs to a juvenile specimen. UFRJ DG 105-R. UFRJ DG 106-R. MZSP-PV 50. MZSP-PV 51. MN 6298-V. MN 6756-V. URC R 67. URC R 68. URC R 69. MPM 114 Ic V - 4 eggs. MPM 115 R. MPM 116 R. MPM 117 R. MPM 119 R. All of these specimens have been recovered in a road cut, south from the city of Marilia, in outcrops known as \\"Estrada Velha\\" pto. 1 and 2. They come from the upper part of the Adamantina Formation, indicating a Late Cretaceous (possibly Campanian/Maastrichtian) age.  Classification  A phylogenetic analysis done by Zaher et al. (2006) found Mariliasuchus amarali to share a close relationship with Comahuesuchus. Andrade et al. (2006), while studying the palate and choanae of some mesoeucrocodylians, reached this same conclusion. Though no name was given to this clade in either publication, it is referred in this article as Comahuesuchidae.  Palaeobiology  Size (3) compared to other Brazilian Cretaceous Crocodylomorphs Mariliasuchus, unlike modern crocodylians, was an animal of terrestrial habits (though see below). Its nostrils were located on the front of the skull, unlike modern crocodiles, in which the nostrils face upwards, to help the animal breathe while its almost completely submerged. Furthermore, the eyes in M. amarali are faced laterally (in modern crocodiles they face upwards). It had a very modified dentition, differentiated in incisiforms, caniforms and molariforms. Strangelly, in particular, were the anterior-most teeth, which were directed horizontally rather than vertically. The function of this strange arrangement is not yet clear, but Vasconcellos et al. (2002) made comparisons with the dentition of pigs, indicating that their dietary preferences may be convergent. It also had strong jaw muscles, indicating a good degree of mandibular activity. There seems to be a significant degree of variation between specimens of M. amarali. Some of this is related to ontogenetic variation, but some may also suggest sexual dimorphism, or even that some of the specimens assigned to this species belong to a different animal. Ontogenetic studies done by Vasconcellos and Carvalho (2005) concluded that during its growth, the skull of M. amarali individuals becomes shorter and the skull more resistant, while being laterally compressed. In adulthood, the orbit has a less circular arrangement than in younger individuals. The postcranial skeleton of Mariliasuchus amarali displays a mixture of traits similar to those present in the skeleton of Cretaceous terrestrial crocodyliform Notosuchus and traits present in aquatic eusuchian crocodyliform, including living crocodilians. Nobre and Carvalho (2013) inferred that Mariliasuchus did not have an erect or semi-erect posture, but rather a sprawling posture and, possibly, had amphibian habits similar to those of living crocodilians.

They reduce wear and stress on cables and hoses, prevent entanglement, and improve operator safety. Cable carriers may be arranged to accommodate horizontal, vertical, rotary and three-dimensional movements.  History  Steel carriers were introduced to the market for the first time in the 1950s. Their inventor Dr Gilbert Waninger and Dr Waldrich, the owner of the Kabelschlepp, recognized the great potential of these chains at an early stage. Until then flexibles such as cables and hydraulic hoses had simply been allowed to hang loose from machines, resulting in damage and rapid wear.Kabelschlepp - History Nowadays, plastic (specifically, polypropylene or PP) cable carriers are also widely used. As of 2007 there were more than seven manufacturers worldwide, including igus, Brevetti Stendalto, EKD Gelenkrohr, FESMA, Murrplastik, Tsubaki Kabelschlepp, CPSYSTEM, Metreel, M Buttkereit, Gortrac and Cavotec.  Structure  Most carriers have a rectangular cross section, inside which the cables lie. Cross bars along the length of the carrier can be opened from the outside, so that cables can be easily inserted and plugs connected. Internal separators in the carrier separate the cables. Cables can also be held in place with an integrated strain relief. Mounting brackets fix the ends of the carrier to the machine. Besides only bending in one plane due to the rigid jointed structure, cable carriers also often only permit bending in one direction. In combination with rigid mounting of the ends of the carrier, this can entirely prevent the enclosed cables from flopping in undesired directions and becoming tangled or crushed.  Variants  Today cable carriers are available in many different styles, sizes, prices and performance ranges. Some of the following variants are: * open * closed (protection from dirt and debris, such as woodchips or metal shavings) * Steel or Stainless steel * low noise * cleanroom compliant (minimal wear) * multi- axis movement * high load resistant * chemical, water and temperature resistant  Cables  Cable carriers are often used with special highly flexible cables to extend the cables' service life.  Application examples  Example of cable carrier in use Cable carriers are used anywhere where there is moving automation involving the transferral of energy, data, liquids or gases. Examples include machine tools, cranes, car washes, medical and laboratory equipment, automatic warehousing, forklifts, industrial robots, offshore oil rigs and stage technology.

It is situated to the south east of Huyton and to the east of Netherley. The village itself is from Liverpool city centre, from Widnes and from Prescot. The M62 motorway junction 6 is in the area and is more familiarly called Tarbock Island. At the 2001 Census, the population of Tarbock was 2,382 (1,146 males, 1,236 females). The parish council was abolished on 1 April 2014. History In 2007, evidence of a Roman Tile works was found around the Tarbock Island area of the M62. The titles were destined for army barracks in Chester. Other archaeology in the area suggests evidence of Roman and Medieval farming. The spelling of Tarbock, named after a local brook, has changed more than any other in the West Derby Hundred. The variations have included Tarboc (1086), Turboc (1245), Terbock (1327), Tarbacke (1637) before it settled on its current form in the late seventeenth century. Currently it is known as \\"Tarbox\\" . The Domesday Survey noted that the manor of Tarboc was one of those previously held by the Saxon Thane Dot. The parish along with that of 'Hitune' (Huyton) was granted to Henry II in 1150 before it was given to the Lathom family. Towards the end of the twelfth century the two were split between different branches of the family with Tarbock being assigned to Henry de Lathom. His son Richard was the first to adopt the name 'de Torbock'. Tarbock Hall features in Saxton's map of Lancashire in 1577, although parts of the hall are believed to be fifteenth century in origin. It was surrounded by a 'moat' which was still very prominent on the Tithe map drawn-up in 1847, although three-sides were reported to have been filled-in by the turn of this century. Ownership of the manor remained in the Lathom family, often through the female line, until 1611 when it was sold to Thomas Sutton, a London gentleman and founder of Charterhouse School. Unfortunately Sutton died a few months later and it was his nephew who sold the estate to Sir Richard Molyneux, the Earl of Sefton three years later for ¬£10,500. The oldest part of the area around Tarbock Green, often called Blue Duck corner after a former Inn. In the fourteenth century Tarbock Hall had its own private chapel but the villagers would have attended St. Michael's Church at Huyton. It is thought that a chapel was built at Tarbock Green in the mid sixteenth century. The building was pulled down in the late 1830s, despite being 'rich in carved woodwork', possibly due to the completion of a building of a Chapel of Ease at Halewood in 1839. This area which is now an important conservation area contains a number of old cottages, including one, believed to be the oldest in the village, which bears a datestone of 1776. In the sixteenth century the manor is described as having two watermills, a windmill and a fulling mill. When the Earl of Sefton conducted a survey of his Estates in 1769 there was both a watermill and a windmill still in use. Even in the early twentieth century the township remained predominantly rural until the opening of a new coalmine at Halsnead Park. Located between the townships of Cronton, Tarbock and Whiston it was called the Cronton Colliery although some of the buildings were sited just within Tarbock. This had a huge impact on the local community as many of the farmers left the land to work on the mine. William Webster, who died in 1684, bequeathed the interest of some shares he held for the poor of both Huyton and Tarbock. Known as Webster's Dole this legacy survived for nearly three hundred years. Another example of local charity is that of the Oddfellows. This group established a lodge in Prescot in 1827 and become very active in the area. In Tarbock alone during the late 1830s three separate lodges were founded, although two did very quickly disband due to lack of members, the Farmers Rest Lodge was more successful and held regular meetings in the Brick Wall Inn. Each July, to mark their foundation day, they would march along Greensbridge Road to Halewood. Improved communications came in the late 1720s with the Liverpool-Warrington Turnpike Trust passing through the township. Although it doesn't appear to have had the same impact it did in other townships it passed through. In the mid-1770s a canal to link the River Mersey with the Sankey Canal was proposed. This route would have gone via Halewood, Cronton and Tarbock but was opposed by the Earl of Derby and the Earl of Sefton as being unnecessary and after a few years the scheme was dropped. In the late nineteenth century there seems to have been a phase of re-development, albeit on a small scale with the Post Office and Smithy building which was originally thatched, being rebuilt in 1884. In 1890 a large pavilion was built alongside the Brick Wall Inn and was an important centre for social and community events until it was demolished in 1940 as part of the complete re-building of the Brick Wall Inn site. Of far more significance was the sale of the Tarbock Estate by a public auction in 1926 at the local Hare and Hounds Hotel. The Sale Catalogue that was produced for the sale provides a detailed insight into the various properties, their value and their tenants, many of whom bought their property. The Estate measured nearly and featured twenty farms including Georgeson's Farm and Wood Lane Farm and over fifty houses and cottages. The original Brick Wall Inn was a plain square building built using handmade bricks and over a period of years a number of outbuildings including a shippon and stables were added. For over a century the licence was held by the Ambrose family. Until the 1880s the ale sold was that brewed by Fleetwood's at the Brewery House on the opposite side of the road. In the 1920s the brewery was bought by the Burtonwood Brewery Company, who made further alterations before it was demolished in 1940 and a new brewery house was built. As the Brick Wall so clearly illustrates whilst many of the properties have histories attached to them, these are often the legacy of former buildings. More recently Tarbock has increased in prominence through its proximity to the Tarbock Interchange. This roundabout is believed to be the largest in Europe, with a circumference of a mile.

Interstate 69 (I-69) is a proposed U.S. Interstate Highway that will pass through the western part of the U.S. state of Tennessee, serving the cities of Union City, Dyersburg, and Memphis. State officials have considered building parts of I-69 as a toll road. Currently, a section of already-existing freeway in Memphis has been approved for the I-69 designation. A section near Union City is under construction. Route description From Fulton, Kentucky, I-69 is planned to continue to the southwest, replacing and bypassing existing U.S. Route 51, serving Union City, Dyersburg (where it will intersect Interstate 155), Ripley, Covington, Millington, and Memphis. On January 18, 2008, the Federal Highway Administration authorized the states of Mississippi and Tennessee to extend I-69 from the I-40/TN 300 interchange in north Memphis to the I-55/I-69 interchange in Hernando, Mississippi; Tennessee has signed the extension of the route, although Mississippi has. Planned extension I-69 in Tennessee has been divided into three of segments of independent utility (SIUs). Tennessee considered legislation that would allow I-69 to be built as a toll road, thereby accelerating its design and construction timetable by several years should such legislation be approved. Tennessee's toll road legislation came as Congress withdrew $171 million allocated for Tennessee highway projects, including funds for I-69, in 2007. This federal highway allotment was diverted to fund ongoing military operations in Iraq. =SIU 7= This SIU begins at the Kentucky/Tennessee border in Fulton, and closely follows US Highway 51 to Dyersburg. The stretch between Dyersburg and Troy is at Interstate Highway standards‚Äîopening with the completion of Interstate 155 west of Dyersburg. An additional stretch north of Union City to within 1100 feet of the Kentucky border is also a freeway. Thus, the vast majority of the work on SIU 7 will involve bypassing the portion of US-51 between Troy and Union City (where it is currently a 4-lane surface arterial with at-grade intersections) and redesigning the US 51/US 45 interchange in South Fulton. This stretch has been divided into five smaller sections. The first two sections make up the Troy Bypass, while the northern three sections represent the Union City Bypass. The first construction contract was let for SIU 7 on October 30, 2009, covering Section 4 (middle leg of the Union City Bypass). The winning bid for constructing the section between TN-21 and TN-5 northwest of Union City, was awarded to Ford Construction Company of Dyersburg for $33 million. Construction on this section of the Union City Bypass began in the Spring of 2010, and was completed in the summer of 2012. However, it will remain closed to traffic until adjacent sections are completed. As of July 2014, land acquisition and utility relocations were underway in all five sections from Troy to Union City. TDOT awarded a construction contract for 2.4 mile Section 3 (southern leg of the Union City Bypass) in March 2016, and planned to let a second contract for Section 5 (northern leg of the Union City Bypass) in December 2016. Work began on Section 3 in June 2016. There is no current timetable for letting contracts to construct the Troy Bypass (Sections 1 and 2). However, TDOT Commissioner John Schroer estimated in February 2013 that it would take around ten years to gradually complete work on SIU 7 due to lack of funding. This situation (and the next one below) regarding funding was solved on May 23,2017 with the signing of the IMPROVE (Improving Manufacturing, Public Roads and Opportunities for a Vibrant Economy) Act. The legislation raised taxes and fees for drivers and others: 6 cents for regular fuel, 10 cents for diesel fuel, and 8 cents for liquefied and compressed natural gases (a total of $355 million). The state would get $250 million, counties $70 million and cities $35 million. Most vehicle owners saw their registration fees go up by $5; private and commercial owners had their fees go up by $10, with ride-sharing exempt; heavy truck operators would pay $20 more. Electric vehicle owners in Tennessee (about 2,500) would pay an additional $100 in registration and renewal fees (since they don't pay fuel taxes); hybrid-electric car owners are exempt from the extra charges. The new money would fund parts of I-69 in the state. The Union City sections (3, 4 and 5) of this segment are on track to be completed by 2022. While TDOT has acquired the right-of-way and is finalizing design for the Troy portion (1 and 2), a timeline for construction has not yet been established. =SIU 8= SIU 8 proceeds south from Dyersburg, paralleling US Highway 51 to a planned interchange with TN-385 (I-269) in Millington. To facilitate work on the Draft EIS this segment, the Tennessee Department of Transportation has divided SIU 8 into three smaller segments. In April 2006 TDOT has announced the preferred routing for the northern and southern subsections, favoring an alignment to the west of Highway 51. Meanwhile, studies are still ongoing for the central section, which include alignments both east and west of the existing US Highway 51. Once TDOT identifies the preferred alignment for the central segment, it is expected that a supplemental draft EIS will be necessary before the final EIS can be prepared. The routing of I-69 has been criticized by the state Sierra Club chapter for not making use of the existing right-of-way for U.S. 51 and for potentially impacting the Hatchie River, a state-designated scenic river. The Tennessee Department of Transportation has suspended work indefinitely on Segment 8 due to a lack of funding. TDOT has further stated that it does not intend to resume work on the Dyersburg-Millington section until Congress commits federal funding to complete environmental studies, right-of-way acquisition and construction. =SIU 9= South of Millington, I-69 will intersect the Interstate 269 Memphis Outer Beltway, then continue southwest, roughly parallel to U.S. 51, then abruptly turn east near General DeWitt Spain Airport to connect with Interstate 40 at the existing State Route 300 interchange in the Frayser neighborhood. Interstate 69 follows I-40 for about to the I-40/I-240 Midtown Interchange, where I-69 continues south along the Midtown portion of I-240 (mileposts 25-31) to the I-240/I-55 interchange in Whitehaven. From that interchange, I-69 continues south, merged with I-55 for approximately , crossing the Mississippi state line. The Mississippi Department of Transportation has been working on widening I-55/I-69 between Hernando and the Tennessee State Line, adding travel lanes in each direction, reconstructing bridges, and improving traffic flow at interchanges. Meanwhile, TDOT is reconstructing I-55 and I-240 from the Mississippi line to Memphis. With much of the route already built and at Interstate standards through Memphis, the FHWA authorized TDOT to sign I-69 over I-55, I-240 and I-40 on January 18, 2008; however, TDOT has done so. However, it has and still is signed as an \\"I-69 FUTURE CORRIDOR\\". The Tennessee Department of Transportation has suspended work indefinitely on the unbuilt section between TN-300 and the proposed interchange with I-269 near Millington due to a lack of funding. TDOT has further stated that it does not intend to resume work on this section until Congress commits federal funding to complete environmental studies, right-of-way acquisition and construction. Exit list This exit lists includes exits from existing I-55, I-240, I-40, SR 300, I-155 and US 51. The I-69 designation has only been approved on the southern 15 miles. I-69 is not currently signed along this route. Auxiliary routes There are to be two auxiliary routes of I-69 in Tennessee. The first, I-169 in Martin and Union City will be a spur route that is currently designated as SR 22. The second, I-269 is a beltway around Memphis. Currently, I-269 is designated south of I-40. The northern segment of SR 385 is expected to be redesignated as I-269 in the future.

The route makes use of the entirety of the former Purchase Parkway, and existing portions of I-24, the Western Kentucky Parkway, and the Pennyrile Parkway. Eventually, I-69 will leave the former Pennyrile Parkway just south of the Audubon Parkway interchange or remain on its current alignment and travel through Henderson on U.S. Route 41 (US 41) north into Indiana. The proposed route for the remainder of I-69 in Kentucky travels about to utilize an as-of-yet-unbuilt bridge into Indiana. I-69 has been divided into three sections of independent utility (SIUs) through Kentucky. SIUs 5 and 6 encompass existing freeways. Federal legislation has designated the route for these sections and Kentucky is in the process of installing I-69 signs on the route. SIU 4 includes a new bridge over the Ohio River between Henderson and Evansville, Indiana. The proposed funding formula calls for Kentucky to finance two-thirds of the projected $1.4 billion bridge, while Indiana would pay for the remaining third. Route description I-69 in Kentucky begins at the Tennessee state line at Fulton. It travels north on the former Purchase Parkway, to Mayfield, where it bypasses the city to the west and north, passing interchanges with KY 80, KY 121, and US 45, after which it heads northeast away from the city, passing through rural areas of Western Kentucky. Exit 41 provides access to US 641 in Benton. I-69 interchanges with US 68 at exit 47 near Draffenville. Just south of Calvert City, I-24 from the west joins I-69. The two highways run concurrently for , crossing over the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and interchanging with US 62 twice. At exit 42 of I-24, I-69 splits off and heads northeast, serving the communities of Princeton and Dawson Springs. At exit 106, the highway meets the western terminus of the Western Kentucky Parkway and the northern terminus of I-169. I-69 then makes a sharp turn to the north, passing by Mortons Gap, Madisonville, and Sebree. A trumpet interchange with KY 425 is located in the southern part of Henderson. Immediately after KY 425 is the western terminus of the Audubon Parkway. I-69 in Kentucky meets its current northern terminus at US 41 in Henderson. History On May 15, 2006, Kentucky governor Ernie Fletcher announced that I-69 will encompass of existing parkways and a segment of I-24. To reflect this decision by state and federal officials, crews began erecting Future Interstate 69 signs along the following highway segments: * Western Kentucky Parkway between I-24 and Pennyrile Parkway, * Pennyrile Parkway between Western Kentucky Parkway and US 41, =Federal legislation= On May 2, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed HR-1195 (SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008) which designates the Pennyrile Parkway from Henderson to Nortonville, and the Western Kentucky Parkway from Nortonville to I-24 at Eddyville as Future I-69. It further designates the Audubon Parkway as a future spur (I-X69) of I-69 once necessary upgrades are completed. President George W. Bush signed the bill on June 6, 2008 and Future I-69 signs began appearing on the parkways in the middle of 2008. This legislation applied the Future I-69 designation to the following roadways: * Pennyrile Parkway from just south of the Audubon Parkway (possibly future I-369) in Henderson to the Western Kentucky Parkway in Nortonville * Western Kentucky Parkway from the Pennyrile Parkway to I-24 in Eddyville * I-24 from Eddyville to the Purchase Parkway in Calvert City * Purchase Parkway from I-24 to the US 51 interchange at the Tennessee state line All four highways, except for the section of the Purchase Parkway south of Mayfield, are now signed as I-69. I-69 concurrent with Western Kentucky Parkway near Dawson Springs during transition period; now only I-69 Signage and mile marker posts were changed in mid-December 2012. =SIU 5= A 2007 engineering study for SIU 5 identified then-current conditions along the Pennyrile and Western Kentucky Parkways. The report identified seven overpasses that fell short of the 16-foot minimum vertical clearance necessary for Interstate Highways. An additional 28 mainline bridges were identified for not meeting the minimum horizontal clearance of . Most ‚Äì if not all ‚Äì of the aforementioned bridges were built during construction of the parkways in the 1960s and are nearing the end of their serviceable lifespans and are due to be replaced. The main issues concerning the 16 interchanges in SIU 5 were short acceleration/deceleration lanes (the average is while Interstate standards mandate ), and tight curve radii at interchanges with loop ramps. A particular challenge was reconfiguring the cloverleaf interchange between the Pennyrile and Western Kentucky Parkways in Nortonville to accommodate the future movement of traffic primarily between points north and points west. According to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet 2006 Six-Year Transportation Plan Executive Summary, the KYTC \\"recently completed a study of the parkway upgrade needs from Interstate 24 to Henderson\\" (SIU 5). The summary further stated that \\"Continuing work on Interstate 69 in Kentucky will depend upon the financial support that can be garnered for the project through federal reauthorization and appropriations processes.\\" The Transportation Plan estimated that the cost of upgrading the parkways would be about $700 million. Nonetheless, the required improvements may be performed on individual segments of the parkways when the existing road surfaces reach the end of their life-spans, in what are known as \\"Pavement Preservation Projects.\\" During a pavement preservation project, the existing pavement is removed, repairs are made to the highway's sub-base, and the road is then resurfaced. During such a project bridges and overpasses may be rehabilitated or replaced, drainage systems are upgraded, and other modifications are made to improve safety on the road without completely reconstructing it, allowing it to remain at least partially open during construction. Two projects on the Pennyrile Parkway and the Western Kentucky Parkway in Hopkins County were evidence that Kentucky took this approach. In 2007, work began on a $14.9 million project to replace of pavement on the Pennyrile Parkway segment slated for the I-69 designation. A similar $23 million project in 2005 replaced and upgraded of pavement on the Western Kentucky Parkway west of the interchange with the Pennyrile Parkway, which was also slated to become part of I-69. Several public meetings were held in towns along the parkways in late November and early December 2007 where Kentucky officials provided detailed information on upgrading the Parkways including changes to the projected cost for the upgrades. The adjusted cost of upgrading the parkways in SIUs 5 and 6 was pegged at around $300 million, significantly lower than initial estimates of $700 million. Of that $300 million price tag, high-priority projects accounted for about half ($145 million) of the total cost. Kentucky transportation officials also raised the idea of applying for a waiver that would allow the parkways to immediately be signed as I-69, making the parkways eligible for federal Interstate Highway funds to complete the upgrades. Without the I-69 designation, the parkway sections slated to become I-69 would not be eligible for Interstate Highway funds for upgrades. Kentucky officials announced that no funding for I-69 was included in the 2008‚Äì2014 Transportation Improvement Plan. In January 2010, Governor Steve Beshear released the next draft Six-Year Plan for consideration by the Kentucky General Assembly. The proposed plan included the reconstruction of several interchanges on the Pennyrile and Western Kentucky Parkways. The proposed work would upgrade the interchanges to Interstate standards as required to get the parkways signed as I-69. Pending approval and funding, the interchange work would begin in 2012 and be finished by 2015. In 2014, work began on the required upgrades to the Pennyrile Parkway in anticipation of the I-69 designation. The cloverleaf interchange with I-69/Western Kentucky Parkway was modified to allow high-speed movements between points north and points west. During the same time frame, several interchanges along the Pennyrile were also reconstructed, and cable barriers were installed in the median. In April 2015, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet awarded a $3 million contract to install I-69 and US 41 signs on the Pennyrile Parkway. The work was completed on November 16, 2015. =SIU 6= From Eddyville, I-69 follows I-24 for , then turns southwest on the Purchase Parkway. I-69's designation along the Purchase Parkway from I-24 to the Tennessee state line at South Fulton, Tennessee was written into law with the fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations Bill. However, many of the same issues that are being addressed in SIU 5 arise in SIU 6 as well, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky is upgrading the Purchase Parkway in a similar fashion. The massive interchange with US 45 and US 51 at the Tennessee state line in South Fulton is the main challenge for completing SIU 6, and has been broken out as a separate project from SIUs 6 and 7. Kentucky is the only state that will be routing nearly its entire portion of I-69 over existing freeways, allowing the state to avoid years of costly environmental studies, and thereby enabling the KYTC to upgrade the parkways to I-69 as soon as funding becomes available. Technically, the Commonwealth of Kentucky could request a waiver from the AASHTO that would allow the state to apply the I-69 designation to its parkways before upgrades are completed, but this would only be able to have been done if adjoining segments in Tennessee or Indiana are completed first. The Purchase Parkway has been designated as future I-69, but the route could not be signed as I-69 until several interchanges, including the interchange with I-24, are upgraded to Interstate standards. , construction was ongoing on the northern portion of the parkway between Mayfield and I-24, including the reconfiguration of the KY 348 interchange at Benton from a toll- booth design (with opposing loop ramps) to a diamond interchange, the installation of cable barriers in the narrow parkway median, and resurfacing of the mainline to increase bridge clearances and lengthen merge lanes at other interchanges along this section. A $37 million contract to reconstruct the I-24/Purchase Parkway interchange was awarded to Jim Smith Contracting Company on November 20, 2015. Construction on the I-24/Purchase Parkway interchange began in early 2016, with completion planned for July 2018. A similar contract to reconstruct the parkway interchanges at the south end of the Mayfield Bypass (exit 21) and KY 80 was let in February 2016. The last remaining \\"tollbooth\\" style interchange requiring reconfiguration, located at KY 339 in Wingo (exit 14), is currently in planning and is scheduled for construction in 2021 according to the 2016 Enacted Six Year Road Plan. The section of the Purchase Parkway north of Mayfield received I-69 signage in July 2018. =SIU 7= The interchange between the Purchase Parkway, US 45 and US 51 straddles the Tennessee state line between the cities of Fulton, Kentucky, and South Fulton, Tennessee. Officially part of SIU 7, the interchange was broken out from the environmental impact statement prepared by the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) for SIU 7 at a time when Tennessee was moving forward with planning for the remainder of SIU 7 (all of which, except for a section of the Purchase Parkway approaching the Fulton‚ÄìSouth Fulton interchange, lies within Tennessee). It was agreed upon by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), and TDOT to prepare a separate environmental assessment (EA)/EIS for the Fulton‚ÄìSouth Fulton interchange when both states were ready to perform its reconfiguration to accommodate I-69. As Tennessee continues to make progress toward completing the unbuilt portion of SIU 7 to the south and Kentucky's upgrades to the Purchase Parkway from the north, both states indicated their intention to start work on reconfiguring the Fulton‚ÄìSouth Fulton interchange. A joint EA/EIS will be prepared by KYTC and TDOT and submitted to the FHWA for a record of decision (ROD) prior to right-of-way acquisition and construction. The 2016 Kentucky Six Year Road Plan includes $7.8 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022 to complete environmental studies, ROW acquisition and utility relocation in anticipation of reconstructing the interchange thereafter. =SIU 4= SIU 4 is still in the planning stages, but Kentucky and Indiana had planned to finance a new bridge across the Ohio River with tolls. The preferred alternative for SIU 4 was to leave the Pennyrile Parkway near its north end and cross the Ohio River to the former I-164 near Evansville, Indiana, and then use the former I-164 to I-64; most of I-164 was redesignated as I-69 in 2014. But the Ohio River bridge plan had stalled in the late 2000s and early 2010s, due to lack of funding from both states. However, with the completion of SIU 5 in Kentucky, and with I-69 connected to Indianapolis via Indiana State Road 37 in Indiana, both states have made completing the Ohio River Bridge a top priority. On June 30, 2016, at-the-time Indiana governor Mike Pence and Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (now Eric Holcomb and Andy Beshear) announced an agreement to resume environmental studies and develop a funding strategy to complete the Ohio River Bridge and its approaches. Indiana will contribute $17 million to restart and lead the environmental studies that will culminate in an approved environmental impact statement (EIS) and record of decision (ROD) that will allow construction to begin. Environmental studies are expected to take about three years to complete, with right-of-way acquisition and construction expected to begin thereafter. Parsons Transportation Group, a California-based firm with offices in Indiana, was picked to complete environmental and preliminary design work on November 15, 2016. Work is due December 31, 2020 (in approximately three years' time). Kentucky has committed over $43 million in its 2016 Six-Year Highway Plan for design and right-of-way acquisition for the bridge. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear (son of former Kentucky governor Steve Beshear) has proposed $267 million in his first Six-Year Highway Plan for the I-69 bridge. $77 million of that would become available from 2020 to 2022 and the rest from 2023 to 2026. The proposed money source would develop the project and then begin a portion of construction running from Kentucky Route 425/Henderson Bypass to US 60. Construction could start as soon as late 2022, according to the proposed plan. The rest of the project, including the bridge, is unfunded. Funding still needs to be approved by the Kentucky legislature before it can be allocated. Because of the financial situation regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic, only $37 million was approved due to possible budget deficits. Tolls The Pennyrile Parkway, Western Kentucky Parkway, and Purchase Parkway were all originally built as toll roads when they opened in the 1960s. As the parkways' construction bonds were paid off, the tolls were removed; the Western Kentucky Parkway became a free highway in 1987, and the other two roads became free in 1992. To fund over $700 million to upgrade substandard segments of the parkways and fund a new $800 million Ohio River crossing for I-69, Kentucky transportation officials had previously considered reinstating tolls on the parkway segments over which I-69 is routed, but ultimately opted to keep I-69 toll-free.

This segment is currently in the final design phase, with construction expected to cost $784 million. Arkansas further divides SIU 13 into several smaller segments. Construction on the first leg of SIU-13, the eastern leg of the Monticello Bypass between US-425 and US-278 east of Monticello, began in November 2011. The first two lanes of the Monticello Bypass (initially signed as US-278 Bypass) opened to traffic on October 11, 2018 and represents the first I-69 mainline project to be completed in Arkansas.

I-69/US 59 in Houston looking east What is now I-69/US 59 (Southwest Freeway) in 1972 I-69W and I-69E will merge just south of Victoria, Texas, where mainline I-69 will follow US 59 northeast to Fort Bend County. In the Houston area, I-69 follows US 59 (Southwest Freeway) from Fort Bend County to the west loop of I-610. I-69 then follows US 59 (Eastex Freeway) from the north loop of I-610 to the Liberty-Montgomery county line. The segment of US 59 inside Loop I-610, through downtown Houston, was approved for designation as I-69 by the FHWA on March 9, 2015 and approved for signage as I-69 by the Texas Transportation Commission on March 25, 2015.Minute Order 5 - March 25, 2015, Texas Transportation Commission I-69 will follow US 59 to the north, serving Cleveland, Shepherd, Livingston, Lufkin, Nacogdoches, and Tenaha. In Tenaha, I-69 will head into Louisiana along the US 84 corridor. The segment of US 59 from Tenaha to Texarkana will be signed as I-369. Since the first section of US 77 between Corpus Christi and Robstown was signed as I-69, it implied that the I-69 mainline would follow the coastal (US 77) route from Victoria to Brownsville. This also implied that the branch along US 59 from Victoria to Laredo and the branch along US 281 from George West to Pharr would be signed as either three-digit spurs of I-69 (I-x69) or as separate two-digit Interstate Highways. While federal legislation designating the south Texas branches as I-69 suggested that these routes may be designated as \\"I-69E\\" (east, following US 77), \\"I-69C\\" (central, following US 281), and \\"I-69W\\" (west, following US 59), the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Special Committee on Route Numbering rejected the Texas Department of Transportation's request for these three designations along the proposed I-69 branches, citing that AASHTO policy no longer allows Interstate Highways to be signed as suffixed routes. Stating that the I-69E, I-69C, and I-69W designations for the three I-69 branches south of Victoria were written into federal law, the initial denial of TxDOT's applications were subsequently overturned by the AASHTO Standing Committee on Highways, and the approval for the I-69E, I-69C, and I-69W branch designations were confirmed by the AASHTO Board of Directors, pending concurrence from the Federal Highway Administration during the AASHTO Spring Meeting on May 7, 2013. During this same meeting, the section of US 83 between Harlingen and Penitas was conditionally approved to be designated as I-2, with FHWA concurrence. The US 83 freeway in south Texas was widely anticipated to receive an I-x69 designation instead of I-2. In any case, Texas is proceeding in the same fashion as Indiana, conducting environmental studies for its portion of I-69 in a two-tier process. The mainline route through Texas will be approximately . On June 11, 2008, TxDOT announced they planned to limit further study of I-69 to existing highway corridors (US 59, US 77, US 84, US 281, and SH 44) outside transition zones in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Laredo, Houston, and Texarkana. Texas originally sought a public-private partnership to construct much of the route through Texas as a privately operated toll road under the failed Trans-Texas Corridor project. However, on June 26, 2008, TxDOT announced that they had approved a proposal by Zachry American and ACS Infrastructure to develop the I-69 corridor in Texas, beginning with upgrades to the US 77 corridor between Brownsville and I-37; the Zachry/ACS plan calls for the majority of the freeway to be toll-free; the only two tolled sections would be bypasses of Riviera and Driscoll. Original plans for the route included a potential overlap with the \\"TTC-35\\" corridor component as well, but the preferred alternative for that component follows I-35 south of San Antonio instead of entering the lower Rio Grande Valley. History Since July 2011, Texas has been proceeding with upgrading rural sections of US 59, US 77, and US 281 to interstate standards by replacing intersections with interchanges, and converting two-lane stretches to four lanes by adding a second carriageway to the existing roadway. A stated goal of TxDOT's I-69 initiative is that \\"existing suitable freeway sections of the proposed system be designated as I-69 as soon as possible\\". A bill was introduced and passed by the House of Representatives that allows interstate quality sections of US 59, US 77, and US 281 to be signed as I-69 regardless of whether or not they connected to other Interstate Highways. Meanwhile, TxDOT has submitted an application to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to designate of US 59 in the Houston area and of US 77 near Corpus Christi as I-69, as these sections are already built to Interstate standards and connect to other Interstate Highways. In August 2011, TxDOT received approval from FHWA for a segment of US 77 between I-37 and SH 44 near Corpus Christi, and was approved by AASHTO in October 2011. Officials held a ceremony on December 5, 2011, to unveil I-69 signs on the Robstown‚ÄìCorpus Christi section. On May 29, 2013, the Robstown‚ÄìCorpus Christi section of I-69 was re-signed as I-69E. At the May 18, 2012, AASHTO meeting, of US 59 (Eastex Freeway) from I-610 in Houston (on the loop's northern segment) to Fostoria Road in Liberty County were also approved as ready for I-69 signage, pending concurrence from the Federal Highway Administration. FHWA later granted concurrence and with the final approval of the Texas Transportation Commission (TTC), the stretch was officially designated as I-69. It was announced on February 6, 2013, that FHWA had approved a segment of US 59 (Southwest Freeway) from I-610 in Houston (on the loop's western segment) to just southwest of Rosenberg, The TTC gave final approval later that month and signage was erected on April 3, 2013. The remaining segment of the original submission (the section within Houston between the northern and western sections of I-610) was approved for designation as I-69 by the FHWA on March 9, 2015, and approved for signage as I-69 by the TTC on March 25, 2015. The south terminus of the I-69 designation is to be extended to the Fort Bend-Wharton county line; this project is scheduled to be completed by September 2020. The northern terminus Interstate 69 will be extended to Cleveland. This project is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will also extended to Shepherd. That project will begin in 2023 and is scheduled to be completed in 2027. On May 29, 2013, the TTC gave approval to naming completed Interstate-standard segments of US 77 and US 281 as I-69. On July 15, 2013, the Interstate markers were unveiled. US 77 through Cameron and Willacy counties are signed as I-69E. That includes of existing freeway starting at the international boundary in the middle of the Rio Grande in Brownsville and running north past Raymondville. The of US 281 freeway in Pharr and Edinburg are signed as I-69C. On November 20, 2014, The TTC voted to add two new sections totaling to I-69 in South Texas. The first section is of newly finished freeway near Robstown in Nueces County and was co-designated as I-69E/US 77 and the second section is a section of new freeway on the north side of Edinburg in Hidalgo County which was co-designated as I-69C/US 281. The designations were approved by the Federal Highway Administration and by AASHTO. As a result, there is now a total of of I-69 in Texas (including I-2). On May 24, 2019, both the Texas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate approved a 10-year extension of highway funding needed for I-69.https://kkyr.com/texas-highway-funding-extended-for-i-69-and-more/ On October 3, 2019, construction on the Nacogdoches I-69 flyover project began and is scheduled to be completed in 2023.

Starting her operatic and concert career in the mid-1960s, she went on to become one of the most prominent female performers of the '70s and '80s. An example of professional longevity, she is present on some of the most prestigious European opera scenes.Mezzosoprana Viorica Cortez: ‚ÄûDrumul meu a fost trasat, nu l-am cƒÉutat‚Äú  Early life  With a well-determined Spanish origin, Viorica Cortez is the eldest sister of the soprano Mioara Cortez, and of »òtefania »òerban, a professor of piano. She was born in Bucium, a village in the vicinity (nowadays a neighbourhood) of Ia≈üi. Cortez enjoyed an artistic milieu in her parents' house, finding her passion and intense desire of studying music. Later on, she was admitted to the Ia≈üi Conservatory and, for her final three years of academic studies, she switched to Bucharest's Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory. In Ia≈üi, at only 17, Cortez made her debut in the alto part of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. She then toured the towns of Moldavia for years, almost exclusively in vocal-symphonical repertoire.  Studies and international recognition  In Bucharest, Viorica Cortez was the student of Arta Florescu, a post-war Romanian soprano and professor (besides Cortez, some of her important apprentices were Marina Krilovici, Eugenia Moldoveanu, Maria SlƒÉtinaru-Nistor, Leontina VƒÉduva and even Angela Gheorghiu). She vividly encouraged the young mezzo-soprano to consider international competitions. Cortez took her advice and applied for the International \\"George Enescu\\" Contest in Bucharest (1964), where she ranked only fourth. The same year, she won the International Singing Contest in Toulouse, along with Romanian fellow tenor Ludovic Spiess. In Le Monde, the well-known critic Jacques Lonchampt praised her dark, velvety mezzo, her artistry and technique, as well as her glittering beauty on the stage. This victory at Toulouse was immediately followed by a contract in the city's noted Th√©√¢tre du Capitole for the year to come. In the final gala, Cortez sang Leonora's aria from Donizetti's La favorita, which was to become one of her signature concert and recital pieces. Also in 1964, Cortez graduated from the Bucharest Conservatory, making her debut in a staged opera production - Gluck's Orph√©e et Eurydice. Next year, she won the Great \\"Kathleen Ferrier\\" Prize at the International Vocal Competition in ¬¥s-Hertogenbosch. She made her debut in Saint-Sa√´ns' Samson et Dalila opposite Ludovic Spiess in Cluj and then in Toulouse the same year, and she returned as Carmen one year later. Cortez then established herself as one of the most respected and recognized young Romanian opera singers, though in her native country she appeared mostly in concerts and recitals. After being hired by the Romanian National Opera in Bucharest in 1967, this changed, as she toured the country and Europe (the former Yugoslavia, France, Greece and especially Ireland), making her debut in Ambroise Thomas' Mignon, Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlo, Aida and Il trovatore, Gaetano Donizetti's La Favorita and Jules Massenet's Werther. In 1967, she won the Grand Prize and the Golden Medal of the International \\"George Enescu\\" Contest in Bucharest, ending her competition itinerary. Already an established name in Romania, she toured France alongside Arta Florescu (in Aida) and made her Chor√©gies d'Orange debut (as Amneris from Aida). The same year, she auditioned for the first and only time in her career for Sir Georg Solti, who was looking for a Carmen in the London Royal Opera House's new production. Apparently, after hearing Cortez, he declared: \\"This IS the Carmen we've been looking for. We found HER\\". Her debut came in 1968 and, although the critics were not unanimously favorable to her, the performances were hailed as one the season's most notable events. For Cortez, that meant not only the launching in a new dimension of her professional career, but also an encounter with Sandor Gorlinsky, the agent who added her to his star-studded roster. More capital debuts came. While maintaining a particular relationship with French opera houses (Toulouse, Rouen, Bordeaux, Avignon, Nice) and still a member of the Bucharest Opera, Cortez sang her first performances in Barcelona (Gran Teatre del Liceu, La favorita, 1969), Vienna (Staatsoper, Don Carlo, 1969), Salzburger Festspiele (Carmen, 1969), Naples (Teatro di San Carlo, Norma and Aida opposite Leyla Gencer), and Paris (Grand Opera, Carmen, 1970).  1970s career  By 1970, Cortez was being considered by virtually every major opera house, but for a Romanian artist, getting out of the country was a major challenge, often insurmountable. The lack of a passport and endless difficulties with the authorities were obstacles not only for her, but for every Romanian performer who hoped for an international career. Many contracts were annulled because of this issue. In the winter of 1970, Viorica Cortez was in Naples for a series of performances of Samson et Dalila opposite Mario del Monaco. She did not return to Romania, deciding to continue her artistic destiny abroad and for quite some time was separated from her family members and friends. Cortez's American debut occurred in 1970. She performed in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, then finally New York, where she first appeared alongside Martina Arroyo in Verdi's Messa da Requiem in Carnegie Hall. Both La Scala and the Metropolitan scheduled her, the first in Samson et Dalila, the other in Carmen. In Milan, succeeding Shirley Verrett's Dalila, Cortez was asked by the opera management and conductor Georges Pretre to consider an extra performance, an exceptional decision of the theatre following the enormous success of her first appearance with the house. In New York, Richard Tucker, her Don Jose for the debut night, hailed her as one of the most attractive and convincing Carmens he has ever sung with. From then on, Cortez's career covered every major opera house in the world. Claudio Abbado invited her for the Verdi Requiem at La Scala, along with Pl√°cido Domingo and Nicolai Ghiaurov. The celebrated Bulgarian bass was her partner for Massenet's freshly revived opera, Don Quichotte, both in Paris and Chicago, the Parisian mise en sc√®ne being assigned to Peter Ustinov. In Chicago, Cortez was a commanding and electrifying Elisabetta in Maria Stuarda opposite Montserrat Caball√© (1973). The friendship and mutual respect between the two divas represented a milestone in Cortez's career. For Norma and Maria Stuarda, as well as for Don Carlo and Il Trovatore, the Catalan soprano and the Romanian mezzo-soprano were scheduled together in Lisbon, Naples, Nice, Vienna, Cologne, Madrid and La Scala (Norma, 1974) and at the Met (Il Trovatore, 1973). In 1972, Viorica Cortez acceded to the Arena di Verona \\"hall of fame\\", interpreting Amneris opposite the Radames of Franco Corelli. In the following years, she would become a favourite of the notoriously picky audience of what is Italy's most demanding opera festival. In 1975, having become a French citizen, she returned to her long-missed Bucharest for a recital at the Atheneum. Cortez felt at home both in the Italian and French repertoire. She portrayed a rapturous Dalila (Teatro Sao Carlos, Lisabona - 1975, Grand Opera, Paris - 1978), a powerful, intense Azucena (Metropolitan, New York - 1973, 1977, 1978, Grand Opera, Paris - 1975, Staatsoper, Vienna - 1973, 1974, 1976, Teatro alla Scala, Milan - 1978), a fragile Charlotte in Massenet's Werther, almost always with Alfredo Kraus, who named her his \\"absolute favourite Charlotte\\", a dramatic Eboli, notably in Vienna, Bordeaux, Lisbon, Bilbao and for La Scala Bicentennial - 1978, a delicate and interiorised Marguerite in Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust (Paris, Verona), and a sovereign and shining Amneris (La Scala, Milan - 1973, Arena di Verona - 1977, Metropolitan, New York - 1979). Nevertheless, her repertory widened every year. She was a shockingly tempestuous Klitemnestra in Richard Strauss' Elektra opposite Birgit Nillson (Rome, 1971). She felt no boundaries or shyness in jumping from one composer to another, mixing Monteverdi (L'Incoronazione di Poppea, Naples, 1976) with Giordano (Fedora, Bologna, 1977), Stravinsky (Oedipus Rex, La Scala, Milan, 1972, 1973, 1980) with Mussorgsky (Boris Godunov, Paris, 1980), Rossini (Tancredi, Martina Franca, 1976) with Lalo (Le Roi d'Ys, Nancy, 1979).  Career of the 1980s  During the 1970s, Viorica Cortez went from one opera to another, across the world, singing Dalila in Paris one day, Azucena in Milan the next, and Giulietta in Chicago the following week. This intensity was about to take its toll. At the beginning of the '80s, Cortez's voice seemed to be slowly but surely deteriorating. Critiques and objections became more and more frequent. Still, as the contracts were signed five years in advance, she had to sing. She was forced to cancel some L'H√©rodiade performances in Avignon, some others in Marseille, and she searched for support besides her family and her vocal trainer. Recovering, she returned to the stage after a couple of months, more cautious, more balanced, decided to abandon the tremendous turmoil of the past. She became quite selective in arranging her schedule. For almost four years, she was rarely in Europe, due to her long-term Metropolitan engagements (Samson et Dalila - 1981, Il Trovatore, Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Adriana Lecouvreur - 1982, 1983, 1984). She starred in some, star-directed productions in Paris (Nabucco, alongside Grace Bumbry and Sherrill Milnes - 1979, Jorge Lavelli's Oedipus Rex - 1979, Joseph Losey's Boris Godunov - 1980 or Sonja Frissell's Un ballo in maschera, alongside Jos√© Carreras - 1981). In 1984, she was a vehement Klitemnestra in Regina Resnik's San Francisco Opera production of Elektra. She sang in Denver, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Bagdad, Tokyo, Osaka, and Amsterdam, but she also returned to stages such as L'Arena di Verona (La Gioconda and Aida - 1988), Grand Opera, Paris (Herodias in Richard Strauss' Salome in the fascinating mise-en-scene of her dear Jorge Lavelli), Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona (Il Trovatore, La Gioconda, Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Il Matrimonio Segreto - 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989), Teatro Comunale di Bologna (Un Ballo in maschera with Luciano Pavarotti - 1989). Still in 1989, she awed Paris, this time as La Star in Zygmund Krause's eponymous opera, directed by Jorge Lavelli. The former editor in chief of Opera International, Sergio Segalini, called her \\"diva assolutta\\". Basis for a new career: the 1990s From the middle of the 1980s, Cortez, extremely conscious of the status of an artist of her calibre, started to abandon the prima donna roles in favour of more mature, real-life and age correspondent parts. She sang her last Eboli in 1982, her last Giulietta and Dalila in 1987, and her last Amneris in 1988. For someone who had been hailed \\"the most beautiful mezzo-soprano in the world\\" it required refinement and elegance to maintain that image. She then alternated her signature roles with the ones that would become the landmarks of her new repertoire: La Cieca in La Gioconda (Verona, Barcelona), Madame Flora in Menotti's Medium (Paris, Catania), Zia Principessa in Suor Angelica (Nice, Madrid, Bilbao, Lisbon), La Marquise de Berkenfield in La Fille du Regiment (Torino, Oviedo, Madrid, Monte-Carlo, Strasbourg), Anaide in Leoncavallo's Zaza (Palermo), Ulrica in Un Ballo in maschera (Barcelona, Genova), Madame de Croissy in \\"Les Dialogues des Carmelites\\" (Avignon, Vichy), Quickly in \\"Falstaff\\" (Bordeaux, Buenos Aires, Hamburg). Her acting abilities, as well as the richness of her voice, made her a sought after mezzo for composition roles (character roles), a trend she followed for the next decade of her career. Equally important, Cortez was able to sing in her native country again, after 20 years of exile. She appeared in numerous benefit galas and concerts and gave recitals in Bucharest and Iasi, as well as opera performances (\\"Carmen\\" in Iasi - 1991, \\"Il Trovatore\\" at the National Opera in Bucharest - 1992).  The 2000s  At the beginning of 2001, coming from Ia≈üi, the car her husband was driving crashed violently into a tree, killing the driver and seriously hurting the mezzo-soprano. After almost six months of recovery, she returned to the stage (La Comtesse de Coigny and Madelon in Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier in Seville), determined to pursue her career. Her comeback was emotionally highlighted by the Spanish press. Subsequently, as a confirmation of the very special relationship between the singer and the Spanish audience, she concentrated most of her career in Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, and Bilbao, without neglecting offers from Italy or France. At the Gran Teatre del Liceu, she added to her repertoire a role she had been dreaming of since the 80s: The Old Countess from Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades, which she reprised in Madrid (Teatro Real, 2004). She later sang Buryovka in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa in Barcelona (2005), where she also opened the 2007-2008 season as la Comtesse/Madelon. Again in 2008, Viorica Cortez made her return to the Monte- Carlo Opera (Starenka Buryovka in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa). She also reprised one of her best recent characters, Madame de Croissy, in Les Dialogues des Carmelites, for the opening of the 2008-2009 season at Teatro Campoamor in Oviedo, in the famed production of Robert Carsen. The performances were highly acclaimed by the press. Later on, she was to debut with Teatro del Maggio in Florence (Cavalleria rusticana). In 2009, Viorica Cortez starred in the creation of a new opera (Une affaire etrangere) in Montpellier. Cortez is scheduled to return on stage in Cavalleria Rusticana for the 2010-2011 season of the Marseille Opera.  Carmen  \\"Carmen du siecle\\" - this is what the French press was headlining in the 1970s. Without any doubt, Cortez was one of the most sought-after Carmens of the 1970s and '80s. She sang the opera 278 times, more than Gianna Pederzini or Giulietta Simionato, and since her big Covent Garden break (1968), she relentlessly deepened the character, almost identifying herself with M√©rim√©e's and Bizet's heroine. The critics applauded her creamy, very extended voice, able to cover all three registers, her exquisite technique, her refinement in the French way of punctuating, as well as her breathtaking beauty and charisma on stage. With Carmen, Viorica Cortez entered the exclusive club of opera stars. She sang the role at La Scala (1972, with Giuseppe di Stefano), Metropolitan Opera (1971, 1979), Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (1968, 1969, 1974), Grand Opera, Paris (1970), Staatsoper, Vienna (1970, 1971, 1973, 1976), Arena di Verona (1975, 1980), but also in Bordeaux, Marseille, Nice, Salzburg, Bilbao, Oviedo, Rome, Trieste, Bologna, Chicago, Naples, Toulouse, Beograd, Piacenza, Rio de Janeiro, Pistoia, Montreal, Lille, Avignon, M√°laga, Genova, Philadelphia, Strasbourg, San Antonio, Seattle, Lisbon, Messina, Lausanne, Bucharest, etc. Her last \\"Carmen\\" was in her native Ia≈üi, in 1991.  Discography  Viorica Cortez arrived in Western Europe when all the major recording labels had exclusive contracts with more famous mezzo-sopranos. Thus, Cortez had to content herself with sporadic recordings. The first international one, made for EMI France, was maybe another missed step: Mercedes in \\"Carmen\\" alongside Grace Bumbry, Jon Vickers, Mirella Freni and Kostas Paskalis, under the baton of Raphael Fruhbeck de Burgos. By that time, Cortez had already sung the role at Covent Garden and all over France, being a demanded Carmen herself. She then had the chance of recording Azucena in Il Trovatore with Bruno Bartoletti and Maddalena in Rigoletto with Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, both operas being filmed for German television. A celebrated recording was that of Il Cappello di Paglia di Firenze by the world-famous film music composer Nino Rota. In 1977, Cortez recorded in Luxembourg her one and only aria recital, which won the Grand Prize of Acad√©mie Lyrique du Disque in France. It was later released as a CD. The lack of official recordings kept Cortez one step behind her illustruous colleagues Fiorenza Cossotto, Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett or Elena Obraztsova. Fortunately, the last decade brought a flourishing of in- house live recordings: Oberto, conte di San Bonifacio (Bologna, 1977), Aida (Vienna, 1973, Denver, 1986), Elektra (Rome, 1971), Norma (Naples, 1973, Caracas, 1975), Maria Stuarda (Chicago, 1973), Il trovatore (Paris 1975, New York 1978, 1981), La favorita (Genova, 1976), Don Carlo (Milan, 1978), Adriana Lecouvreur (New York, 1983), Gioconda (Verona, 1988), Suor Angelica (Madrid, 1993), Zaza (Palermo, 1994), La fille du r√©giment\\" (Madrid, 1996), Les contes d'Hoffmann (Orange, 2002), Jen≈Øfa (Barcelona, 2005).  Personal life  Viorica Cortez was married three times: first, to the Romanian sculptor Marcel Guguianu, then to the French composer Emmanuel Bondeville, former manager of the Paris Opera and Op√©ra Comique, and finally to the Romanian-born historian Adolf Armbruster. From the first marriage, the singer has one daughter - Catalina.  References   Sources  * Adolf Armbruster - \\"Viorica Cortez.

They were joined by Sakureu and Hirono on guitar and Kyouka on drums, later Emiru was recruited on bass. But before their first performance in March 1995 Mayu left, Sakureu left a short while later and Mayu returned to replace him. In October however Kyouka and Hirono both left.

He represented Essex North in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1902 to 1914 as a Conservative member. He was born in Anderdon Township, Essex County, Canada West, the son of farmer Oliver Reaume, and received his teacher's certificate in 1873. He taught school and pursued further studies in Toronto and Sandwich (later Windsor). He went on to study medicine at the Detroit College of Medicine and Trinity College, setting up practice in Windsor. He married Catherine Turner in 1887. He served as Commissioner of Public Works in 1905 and Minister of Public Works from 1905 to 1914. During his time as the first Franco-Ontarian cabinet minister, the government of Sir James Pliny Whitney decided to impose Regulation 17, which effectively placed severe restrictions on all French instruction in the province's bilingual elementary schools following the Merchant Report in 1912. Reaume defended the government's policy and its subsequent modifications in Regulation 18 which allowed for one hour of French instruction per day in the previously bilingual schools. Reaume argued that many Franco-Ontarian parents actually wished that their children would receive a first class education in English in order to access better paying jobs. Nevertheless, many Franco- Ontarian parents, children and teachers protested this new policy by marching out of their classrooms upon the arrival of the ministry appointed school inspectors. Reaume subsequently paid the price, when voters in the riding of Windsor voted against him in 1914, electing his Liberal opponent. He died at Sandwich, Ontario in 1933.

Intuitively, Wijsman convergence is to convergence in the Hausdorff metric as pointwise convergence is to uniform convergence. History The convergence was defined by Robert Wijsman. The same definition was used earlier by Zdenƒõk Frol√≠k.Z. Frol√≠k, Concerning topological convergence of sets, Czechoskovak Math. J. 10 (1960), 168‚Äì180 Yet earlier, Hausdorff in his book Grundz√ºge der Mengenlehre defined so called closed limits; for proper metric spaces it is the same as Wijsman convergence. Definition Let (X, d) be a metric space and let Cl(X) denote the collection of all d-closed subsets of X. For a point x ‚àà X and a set A ‚àà Cl(X), set :d(x, A) = inf_{a in A} d(x, a). A sequence (or net) of sets Ai ‚àà Cl(X) is said to be Wijsman convergent to A ‚àà Cl(X) if, for each x ‚àà X, :d(x, A_{i}) to d(x, A). Wijsman convergence induces a topology on Cl(X), known as the Wijsman topology. Properties * The Wijsman topology depends very strongly on the metric d. Even if two metrics are uniformly equivalent, they may generate different Wijsman topologies. * Beer's theorem: if (X, d) is a complete, separable metric space, then Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is a Polish space, i.e. it is separable and metrizable with a complete metric. * Cl(X) with the Wijsman topology is always a Tychonoff space. Moreover, one has the Levi-Lechicki theorem: (X, d) is separable if and only if Cl(X) is either metrizable, first-countable or second-countable. * If the pointwise convergence of Wijsman convergence is replaced by uniform convergence (uniformly in x), then one obtains Hausdorff convergence, where the Hausdorff metric is given by ::d_{mathrm{H}} (A, B) = sup_{x in X} big d(x, A) - d(x, B) big. : The Hausdorff and Wijsman topologies on Cl(X) coincide if and only if (X, d) is a totally bounded space.

Nurses with at least three years of training were able to volunteer for the service, and facilities comprised 23 large buildings earmarked for use as hospitals in the event of war. The TFNS was augmented by the affiliation of Voluntary Aid Detachments. On the outbreak of the First World War, the hospitals were commissioned and up to 2,784 nurses mobilised to staff them. By the end of the war, up to 8,140 nurses had served with the TFNS, 2,280 of them in hospitals and casualty clearing stations abroad. After the war, the TFNS became the Territorial Army Nursing Service in line with the reconstitution of the Territorial Force as the Territorial Army. Formation The Territorial Force Nursing Service (TFNS) was established by Richard Haldane as part of the Territorial Force, created by his reform of auxiliary forces in the United Kingdom (UK). The service was inaugurated in July 1908, and its first Matron-in-Chief was Sidney Browne, who had previously held this position in the Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS). Twenty-three large buildings, such as schools, colleges, hotels and public buildings, were earmarked across the country for use as territorial hospitals, though they retained their civilian usage in peacetime and would only become operational in the event of war.Hallett p. 21 TFNS nurses had to be 23 years of age or older and must have completed at least three years of training in a recognised hospital. They received neither pay nor special training during peacetime, though matrons underwent seven days of training in a military hospital bi-annually. By March 1909, enough nurses for 15 hospitals in England and Scotland had volunteered. Opposition from the Army Nursing Board, Sydney Holland (Chairman of the London Hospital) and senior London nurses delayed the establishment of the TFNS in the capital until the middle of March. On the 15th, 400 nurses were recruited as a result of a public meeting attended by many well-known speakers, including Elizabeth Haldane (vice-chairwoman of the Territorial Nursing Council and sister of Richard), Isla Stewart (Matron at St Bartholomew's Hospital) and Sir Alfred Keogh (Director General Army Medical Services). This was enough to establish two hospitals: No.1 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed exclusively by nurses from St Bartholomew's Hospital; and No.2 (City of London) General Hospital, to be staffed by nurses from the London Hospital and Guy's Hospital. Also in 1909, the TFNS was augmented by the affiliation of the Red Cross- organised Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADs). By January 1911, some 3,000 nurses had enrolled in the TFNS, and the next year the VADs numbered some 26,000 members.Beckett 2011 p. 221 In 1913, TFNS nurses were given permission to volunteer for overseas service. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the hospitals were commissioned and the TFNS mobilised. By the end of the month, 19 territorial hospitals were operational and between 2,117 and 2,784 TFNS nurses had been mobilised to staff them. The remaining four hospitals became operational the next month, and another two were opened in 1915 and 1917. Some territorial hospitals could be quite considerable, such as Manchester's 6,700-bed Second Western General Hospital. There were also hundreds of smaller auxiliary hospitals, used initially for surgery and later as convalescent facilities. Eighteen territorial hospitals were established overseas, and TFNS nurses also worked alongside QAIMNS nurses in military hospitals and casualty clearing stations in France, Belgium, Malta, Salonica, Gibraltar, Egypt, Mesopotamia and East Africa.Beckett 2011 p. 221Hallett pp. 21 & 57‚Äì58 In total, between 7,117 and 8,140 nurses served in the TFNS during the war, of which 2,280 served overseas.Hay 1953 p. 337Haldane p. 179 One such nurse was Grace Mitchell, who had been called up shortly after the start of the war. She worked initially in the 3rd Southern General Hospital in Oxford, and in May 1917 transferred to Unit 56 General Hospital in √âtaples, France. This was a Base Hospital, part of the casualty evacuation chain, located further back from the front lines than the casualty clearing stations. The hospitals were located close to the coast, with good rail access to facilitate the transport and repatriation of casualties. From September 1918, she worked at several casualty clearing stations in France, Belgium and Germany, and was demobilised in May 1920. Military nurses were traditionally required to be unmarried or widowed with no dependents, but the shortage of nurses during the war meant that married women were allowed into the service and single nurses who married were allowed to remain. Following the war, most nurses returned to civilian work, and all married nurses were forced to resign from the TFNS. In line with the reconstitution of the Territorial Force as the Territorial Army, the TFNS became the Territorial Army Nursing Service in 1921.

Gorton of American Terra Cotta & Ceramic Co. presented a paper entitled ‚ÄúExperimental Work, Wise and Otherwise.\\" This paper was significant for being the first presented at the convention with a scientific focus, and motivated the formation of a non- commercial society dedicated to the exchange of ideas and research on the science of ceramics. The American Ceramic Society was officially formed on February 6, 1899, at its first annual meeting, which was held in Columbus, Ohio. Organization ACerS is organized into the following eleven divisions : *Art, Archaeology and Conservation Science. advances the scientific understanding of the materials found in ceramic art, and provides information that aids in the interpretation, reconstruction and preservation of traditional ceramic art and artifacts, as well as the techniques used in their creation artistic purposes. *Basic Science is concerned with studying the chemistry and physics of ceramics. *Bioceramics is dedicated to stimulate the growth and activity of the Society, particularly in the areas of the science, engineering, and manufacturing of bioceramics, biocomposites, and biomaterials. *Cements centers on the development and manufacture of cements, limes, and plasters. *Electronics examines ceramic materials for use in electronic devices. *Engineering Ceramics deals with the use of ceramics and their composites as structural and mechanical components. *Glass & Optical Materials centers on the design, manufacture and use of glasses. *Manufacturing focuses on meeting the broader needs of today's manufacturers who produce or use ceramic and glass materials, including the entire supply chain. In addition to enhancing networking opportunities, it addresses new manufacturing processes and techniques, sustainability, and business and environmental issues. *Nuclear & Environmental Technology concentrates on the use of ceramics in nuclear energy production and medicine. *Refractory Ceramics explores ceramics for use in high temperature and other hostile environments. *Structural Clay Products is concerned with the manufacture of brick, pipe, and red-body tile. Classes =Keramos= Keramos was founded by ACerS in 1902 as a professional fraternity of ceramic engineering. It has active chapters at University of Arizona, University of Florida, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Iowa State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rutgers University, New York State College of Ceramics, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Clemson University, and University of Washington. =National Institute of Ceramic Engineers= The National Institute of Ceramic Engineers (NICE) works with ABET to accredit collegiate programs in ceramics. Materials science and engineering programs that offer an option to specialize in ceramics are accredited by NICE in conjunction with TMS. NICE is also responsible for writing and administering the Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam in ceramics engineering. =Ceramic Educational Council= The Ceramic Educational Council was founded in 1938 with the goal of improving ceramics education. .

Common approaches to risk assessment and risk management strategies based on natural hazards have been applied to climate change impacts although there are distinct differences. Based on a climate system that is no longer staying within a stationary range of extremes, climate change impacts are anticipated to increase for the coming decades despite mitigation efforts. Ongoing changes in the climate system complicates assessing risks. Applying current knowledge to understand climate risk is further complicated due to substantial differences in regional climate projections, expanding numbers of climate model results, and the need to select a useful set of future climate scenarios in their assessments. In the course of increasing global temperature and extreme weather phenomena the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for a better understanding of climate change. Its main aim is evaluating climate risks and exploring strategies for their prevention. Climate risks According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report: \\"Impacts from recent climate- related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability\\". The following future impacts can be expected: * Temperature increases * Extreme weather * Bumper crops and crop failure * Polar cap melting * Changes to Earth's eco-systems * Epidemics * Disruption of the North Atlantic current While affecting all economic sectors, effects on single continents will vary. Beside these direct physical climate risks there are also indirect risks: * Physical risks: Direct risks of climate change negatively impact agriculture, fisheries, forestry, health care, real estate and tourism. For example, storms and flooding damages buildings and infrastructure, and droughts lead to crop failure. *Regulational risks: Governmental endeavours to reduce climate costs have direct effects on the economy. For example, Kyoto-Protocol emissions targets could be realised by implementing emissions trading, requiring the cost of emissions to be quantified monetarily. These costs would be used by companies to evaluate investment decisions. Factoring in emissions costs will cause prices to rise therefore impacting consumer demand. The insecurity of legislation leads to indefinite postponement of projects and investments. *Litigational risks: Similar to the tobacco industry, industries producing excessive greenhouse gases (GHG) are exposed to the risk of an increasing number of lawsuits if damages can be correlated to emissions. *Competitive risks: If companies do not take measures to reduce climate risks they are competitively disadvantaged. This might lead to increasing production costs caused by obsolete technologies and therefore to decreasing profits. *Production risks: Production shortfalls can result from direct or indirect climate risks, i.e., hurricanes damaging oil production facilities can lead to supply disruption and increased prices. Also the price for energy will rise, as heatwaves cause water scarcity, impacting the supply of power plant cooling water. *Reputational risks: Companies publicly criticized for their environmental policies or high emissions might lose customers because of negative reputation. *Financial risks  References  Effects of climate change Insurance Natural hazards ","title":"Climate risk"},{"id":"12850921","text":"is a Japanese former baseball player, coach, and manager for the Yakult Swallows in Nippon Professional Baseball.

Tabloid Man. (Ezra Norton Biography). 2008 Early life Norton was born in the Sydney suburb of Watsons Bay, son of the proprietor of Truth, John Norton (1858‚Äì1916) and Ada McGrath (1871‚Äì1960), whom he married some weeks later. During his childhood, he was subject to his father's drunken assaults on his mother and himself. He was educated at Scots College, Bellevue Hill. Valerie Lawson notes that \\"Norton often stayed away from school and was thrashed when he did attend.\\" After failing to matriculate twice, he was sent to Christian Brothers' College, Waverley, where he was treated better. Norton learned the newspaper trade in his father's business. His father died in 1916, but had disinherited his wife and Ezra and left the bulk of his estate to Ezra's 9-year-old sister, Joan Norton (1907‚Äì1940). His mother Ada Norton (n√©e McGrath) persuaded the New South Wales Parliament to backdate the new Testator's Family Maintenance Act to take effect before his father's death. Under this legislation, she succeeded in having his will rewritten in 1920 so that she and Ezra Norton each received a third of his inheritance, allowing Ezra Norton to gain control of Truth and Sportsman Ltd the publisher of the Sydney Truth, the Melbourne Truth, sister papers in Brisbane and Perth, and the Sydney Sportsman, each published on Sundays. Career Norton attempted to widen his papers' range by adding a little discussion of culture, but they soon moved back to their traditional coverage of sport, crime, and divorce. Frank Packer's launch of the Sunday Telegraph in 1939 undermined the viability of the Sydney Truth and he attempted to fight back by establishing a daily paper to compete with the Telegraph and \\"The Sun\\" in which he succeeded despite wartime paper rationing. Frank Packer and Ezra Norton were bitter rivals in business for many years. On Derby Day 1939, Ezra Norton and Frank Packer fought it out literally, with fists, in the members' enclosure at Randwick Racecourse.Claire Harvey Looking back over 70 years at The Sunday Telegraph Daily Telegraph 20 November 2009 Norton gained a licence from the Minister for Trade and Customs, Eric Harrison to launch the Daily Mirror in Sydney in 1941.Hall, Sandra.

In October 1958, Norton and his partners sold their newspapers to the Fairfax group from whom they were acquired by Rupert Murdoch in 1959. Norton was incensed by the content of a Cyril Pearl book highly critical of Norton's deceased father and was \\"widely believed\\" to have lobbied the NSW State Government for changes that in 1958 extended defamation law to cover the reputation of the dead. Although Norton retained some business interests, by 1960 he had virtually retired from the business world. He resided at a waterfront mansion at Vaucluse until his death in 1967. Family In 1922, Norton married an English war widow, Lillian Mary (Molly) Willoughby. Molly was a 29-year-old dancing teacher. He also adopted her infant son, John Stanley Norton. They were happily married for 30 years until Molly Norton died suddenly on 20 March 1952. The following year, on 11 June 1953, Norton married Emma Georgina (Peggy) Morrison and they had one child, a daughter, Mary Norton, born in 1955.

Biography Ren√© has been active in music since he was eight years old. He started having piano lessons in a classical sense and later he also had some lessons on the organ. As a child Ren√© quickly got fascinated by the organs and synthesizers he saw on TV every week in the Dutch music shows TopPop and Countdown. Also, his piano teacher of that time (in 1983) played a Roland Jupiter 6 synthesizer in a band. During a lesson this synthesizer stood next to the piano that remained untouched that day. Since 1987 the interest in electronic music started to grow immensely. The music of Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds got his interest. In 1993 Ren√© bought his first set of synthesizers like the Korg Poly800 and Yamaha DX7. During this period Ren√© started to compose and record many pieces of music. Also an expanse of more electronic instruments and recording-devices happened. Next to this expansion, Ren√© studied a lot of recordings of electronic music and was influenced by artists from the Innovative Communication label like: Mind over Matter, G.E.N.E., Software, Quiet Force, Megabyte and Double Fantasy. During the years 1995 to 2003 Ren√© van der Wouden recorded a lot of electronic orientated works on Tascam, Fostex and Akai reel- to-reel recorders. Some of those tracks are released on albums released by AmbientLive records UK. In 2004 Ren√© started to prepare, compose and record the albums \\"Recreation\\" and \\"Pro Sequentia\\". The latter was released firstly. Pro Sequentia, the debut CD, was released first on the German Syngate label on April 16, 2005. This is an album of electronic music inspired by Berlin School artists as Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze but also Jean-Michel Jarre. This album was received well by the audience and reviewers and led to the first performance on E-Live 2005. But because of different visions between Syngate and Ren√©, the latter left and formed his own electronic music label in May 2005 for releasing his music. The Pro Sequentia album has been well received all over the EM-scene. The music can be described as retro/Berliner Schule with contemporary elements. On this album analogue and digital synthesizers were used together will all the power and comfort of computers. The concert at E-Live 2005 was the first concert of electronic music by Rene. This E-Live 2005 (an annual held festival of electronic music) sub-stage concert consisted of 3 sets. The first set was in the style of the Pro Sequentia album, the second set consisted of 2 tracks of ambient music and the last set/concert took place together with the most successful Dutch musician of electronic music today, Gert Emmens. The music was recorded for personal documentation and will not be released. In 2006 the follow-up CD of Pro Sequentia was released on the September 21, 2006 as Alchemia. This CD is much more Berliner Schule/retro/sequencer based than Pro Sequentia and also contains the use of samples of \\"the EM-instrument\\", the Mellotron. The overall style of the music can be referred to what is called the \\"Golden Era\\" of electronic music. The theme of the CD is \\"Alchemy\\". For years Ren√© has been interested in this kind of philosophy. On October 28, 2006 there was a special concert given by EL-KA, Ren√© van der Wouden & Syngate artists at the GASOMETER, Oberhausen in the afternoon from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The inspiration for this concert was: \\"How can we sound like our favorite electronic music band Tangerine Dream in a unique setting and building?\\" For 2007 there were no albums planned, although the \\"Universal Quiet\\" album was planned for the fall of 2007 but due to some personal reason this album was released on January 4, 2008. This album can be seen as a further seek into the Cosmos, therefore its title. It's also referring to the period of the 1970s and 1980s of electronic music. This album was a well received one by the critics of electronic music all over the world. In September 2008 the album \\"Sequential Tourism\\" was released. This album is a mixture of styles of retro music and rhythms in 4 long tracks and one short one. Next to the use of analogue synthesizers like SE Moog, Yamaha CS50, Sequential Pro One and the Moog The Rogue, modern rhythm patterns were used to give the music an exploring mood. December 2009 was the time right for the release of \\"Numerus Fixus\\", the album about the world's natural places and how they become more and more important to this highly polluted world. This album gained a lot of good reviews all over the electronic music scene worldwide. It's one of the most successful albums of the composer. The year 2011 was the most busiest year of Ren√© van der Wouden. Several concerts were given in the Netherlands and in Germany. 3 releases of fine electronic music. For 2012 there are no musical plans.

The Society's main purpose is to facilitate knowledge sharing and management in Arab countries through promoting research and development in those fields and offering programs and qualifications that support its purpose. History The idea behind the Society's set up came about when managers and businessmen in the Arab world became aware of the necessity of coordinating their efforts by organizing themselves into an association. Accordingly, the Arab Management Society was established upon the invitation of the chairman of TAGorg Talal Abu-Ghazaleh on August 29, 1989, in Buffalo, New York, and was officially registered in Amman, Jordan, on October 10, 1990. The society's name was amended to become the Arab Knowledge and Management Society (AKMS) on December 23, 2000, to emphasize the group's objective towards a knowledge society. Agreements with international organizations At the end of 1994, AKMS submitted a membership application that was approved by the ISO/TC 176 Committee. AKMS was the first Arab non-profit organization to become a member of one of the technical committees of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Society was granted a membership in 1994 to join the most ISO/TC 176/SC2. The Society's membership in this committee is a representative one, as active membership is limited to official national standardization institutions. It is worth mentioning that AKMS is one of only two Arab representatives that have joined the ISO/TC 176 committee, the other Arab organization being the Egyptian Standardizations Organization. So far, no other Arab organizations have joined this committee. In 1998, the Society's representative, Khaled Abu-Osbeh was elected to join a group of experts called ISO/TC 176/SC 2/WG 18. This group was responsible for laying down the ISO specifications. In October 2001, during the committees‚Äô meetings held in the British city of Birmingham, the Society was accepted as a member of the ISO/TC 176 committee and was invited to participate in the ISO/TC 176/SC3 committee, in recognition of its active role in the ISO/TC 176/SC2 committee. In the year 2006, AKMS managed to secure cooperation agreements with several international organizations that work in the field of knowledge and quality management. AKMS was awarded membership of the British Institute of Quality Assurance (IQA). The IQA membership has granted the Society several advantages, among which are the provision of all publications and data related to quality on a regular basis as well as a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the IQA to set up a mechanism for cooperation in the field of professional training and publications. During that same year, AKMS activated its agreement with the International Standardized Testing Organization (ISTO). The agreement involved updating the Society's data on the ISTO website in addition to providing the Society with the marketing materials necessary to market the ISTO exams. Meanwhile, partnership with ICANN was also enhanced through several cooperation agreements signed. In July 2007, AKMS launched the first quality-specialized program in the Arab region; the Arab Certified Quality Manager (ACQM) program. Cooperation agreements AKMS has concluded several academic agreements through which it seeks to realize benefits for all members in the Arab world. Such agreements include, but are not limited to, the following: ‚Ä¢ Association with Canisius College in New York. ‚Ä¢ Cooperation with the Center for Applied Studies in International Negotiations (CASIN). ‚Ä¢ Partnership Agreement with the International Standard Testing Organization (ISTO).

As with DSI's other instruments, the Prophet '08 uses analog subtractive synthesis, as opposed to many of the current crop of synthesizers, which employ DSP-based virtual analog synthesis. Similar in functionality to the renowned Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 analog synthesizer popularized in the 1970s (also designed by Dave Smith), the Prophet '08 has an all analog signal path; however its envelopes are generated digitally. It is one of many analog synthesizers commercially available . In 2017, the Prophet '08 was superseded by the '08 Rev2. The new instrument is available in both 8-voice and 16-voice versions in both keyboard and module variants. The Rev2 added improved onboard effects and a polyphonic sequencer. Sound Architecture The Prophet '08 is an eight-voice analog synthesizer. Each voice is identical in architecture. The audio path is all analog, while there is some digital control of parameters. The instrument can be played in three modes: eight voices all using the same program, \\"split\\" with four voices using one program and four using another program on separate sections of the keyboard, and \\"stacked\\" with four voices using one program and four using another program, both programs sounding on each note played resulting in a four-voice sound. =Analog signal components= Each voice has two DCOs, one VCF, one VCA, three ADSR envelopes, and a noise source. Each DCO can produce triangle, sawtooth, a predefined mix of sawtooth and triangle, and rectangular waves. The pulse width of the rectangular waves ranges from 0 to 100%, and has a dedicated knob. The relative levels of the two DCOs is set with a balance knob. The pitch and pulse width of each DCO and the relative level of the two can be modulated. The VCF is switchable between a 4-pole low-pass filter and a 2-pole low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency can be anywhere in the audio spectrum. Cutoff frequency and resonance each have a dedicated knob. Both can be modulated. There is a dedicated knob for keyboard modulation of the filter cutoff. The VCA comes last in the signal chain. Its level can be modulated. Since velocity is often used to control the VCA level, there is a dedicated knob for the amount of velocity affecting the filter envelope. =ADSRs (Envelope generators)= The Prophet '08 has three ADSR envelopes. The first ADSR is normalized to the VCF cutoff frequency. The second ADSR is normalized to the VCA amount. The third ADSR is extra. Despite normalizing, any of the ADSRs can be sent to any modulation destinations. Each ADSR has a dedicated knob for attack, decay, sustain, and release. Any of these four parameters can be modulated. There are also knobs for initial delay, ADSR output level, and keyboard control. =Modulation architecture= The Prophet '08 has four general purpose modulation buses. For each bus, the modulation source, modulation destination, and the modulation amount can be selected. For common modulation routings, it is not always necessary to consume a modulation bus, because some modulation sources or destinations have their own dedicated modulation routing controls. For instance, each of the four LFOs has its own amount and destination setting. So it is possible to route an LFO directly to any destination without consuming one of the modulation buses. Common controllers such as velocity, channel pressure, and modulation wheel each have their own destination and amount settings, so they too can be used as a modulation source without consuming a modulation bus. A few destinations have dedicated modulation routings in place. The VCF has a dedicated knob for keyboard control of cutoff frequency. The VCF and VCA each have a dedicated knob for velocity control of cutoff frequency and volume, respectively. All of these controls are in place without consuming any of the aforementioned modulation buses or routings. =Audio outputs= The Prophet '08 has two sets of stereo audio outputs. All of the sound comes out of set A, unless set B has plugs in it, in which case the second layer (in the case of a split or stacked program) will appear only on set B. The VCA has a pan setting which can be modulated. Pan is a standard modulation destination, which means that any of the controllers, such as note number, LFO, or ADSR, can be used to position each voice in the stereo spectrum. Also, each of the 8 voices by default has its own position in the stereo spectrum, which is the starting point for any further pan modulation. The spread of these starting positions is controlled by a dedicated knob on the VCA; at a setting of 0 all voices are centered unless further modulated. There is a global setting to put the instrument into mono mode instead of stereo. =Sequencer section= The Prophet '08 incorporates a 16-step, 4-row sequencer with analog-style controls. Each row of the sequencer can be routed to any modulation destination. When the destination for a row is a DCO pitch, that row's knobs are calibrated to move in quarter-tone increments. For other destinations, the knobs are continuous. The sequencer can be stepped through by the internal clock, MIDI clock, or the keyboard. =Artists= On the website of Dave Smith Instruments, a comprehensive list is available of artists who use various of the company's products, including the Prophet '08.http://www.davesmithinstruments.com/artists Notable users of the Prophet '08 include Chvrches, deadmau5, Rival Consoles, Thom Yorke and Sufjan Stevens.

The lake is shallow, mostly not exceeding a depth of one meter. The open water area of 1.7 km2 is surrounded by a wetland covering 4.1 km2, including paddy fields. In 2001 the lake was proposed as a wetland of international importance by the Thai government. Folklore Phadaeng and Nang Ai Phangkhi According to local folklore, from the very beginning Nong Han played a part in the story of Phadaeng and Nang Ai. Nang Ai was the daughter of King Kom who ruled the country of Chathida. The beauty of Nang Ai was famed far and wide. Many desired a royal wedding with her, and not all were men. Among the many who would wed Nang Ai were Prince Phadaeng, a man from another land, and Prince Pangkhii, who had wed Nang Ai in a former life but in this one was the son of Phaya Nak, the Grand NƒÅga who ruled the deep. So many suitors desired to wed Nang Ai that her father staged a rocket festival competition, the winner to win a royal wedding. But hopes were dashed when only the rockets of her uncles made it aloft, and her father called the whole thing off. Naga Prince Pangkhii shape-shifted into a white squirrel to spy on Nang Ai, but she saw him and had him killed by a royal hunter. Pangkhii's flesh magically transformed into meat equal to 8,000 cartloads (a metric cartload is 2,000 litres). Nang Ai and many of her countrymen ate of this tainted flesh, and Phaya Nak vowed to allow no one to remain living who had eaten of the flesh of his son. Aroused from the deep, he and his watery myrmidons rose and turned the land into a vast swamp of which Nong Han is a remnant.

He was the son of a Naples-born Italian architect of Scottish descent and an Egyptian woman. Smith relocated to Italy as a child and later made a living as a translator for Arabic-speaking tourists in Rome. Raised as a Catholic, he eventually converted to Islam.

Critics of Smith, however, contend that his association numbers very few members. He came to preeminence in the Italian media when he requested that a crucifix be removed from Ofena's elementary school, where his son was a student. He was subsequently a regular guest on Italian media venues, where he vehemently attacked Western civilization and Christianity. In 2001, he founded the Italian Islamic Party (Partito Islamico Italiano). He attracted more media attention by demanding that crucifixes in public places (e.g., schools, hospitals, and government offices) be removed, and throwing a crucifix out of the window of his mother's hospital room after authorities refused to remove it. The Italian Council of State, with the sentence number 556 of 13 February 2006, upheld the display of the crucifix in government-sponsored spaces.

Background The play was adapted by Frank Vosper and opened at the New Theatre on 31 March 1936. Vosper starred in the play, which was later turned into a successful film. Promotional extracts were broadcast on the BBC Regional Programme on 1 May 1936 in a 20-minute programme with members of the then-current stage cast. On 9 May 1936, the final performance was given at the New Theatre, and the play immediately transferred to the Queen's Theatre on11 May, where it ran until 8 August 1936. It reopened two days later at the Streatham Hill Theatre for one week. Reception of London production The play garnered good reviews with the Daily Herald stating that it was \\"a brilliant terror play\\" and \\"our blood was gloriously curdled last night\\". The Times was equally enthusiastic stating \\"The final act is very sure of its effect. The suspense is maintained; each turn of the story is clear and striking; the terror-stricken self-control of the girl and the man's gross and abominable insanity are depicted by Miss Marie Ney and Mr Vosper with every refinement of a murderous thriller. Within the limits of its purpose, the acting of this scene could scarcely be bettered.\\" It is claimed that the climax was so chilling to members of the audience that some fainted with the suspense. Ivor Brown in The Observer of 5 April 1936 wrote \\"There is authentic and tremendous suspense about the struggle between Bruce and his captive wife. One feels that, if any bird did nest near this cottage, it would be the croaking raven or fatal owl.\\" Frank Vosper's performance was described as \\"very clever\\" and \\"a first-rate study of disintegration, in which the muscle of the first act becomes the fearsome flabbiness of the last. Both the chief players have to change character during the play, which, since this is well done, gives it a special acting-value apart from its interest of plot and problem.\\"The Observer 5 April 1936 (Page 17) The Scotsman of 1 April 1936 started its review with: \\"To watch the performance of Love from a Stranger at the New Theatre is like witnessing a clever conjuring show. One knows that all that is apparently happening is next to impossible, yet one cannot fail to be thrilled.\\" The review went on to state \\"Mr Frank Vosper achieves with great art the transformation from a pleasant young Colonial to a habitual murderer. The scene where he gradually reveals his true character by tearing up his wife's scarf in a paroxysm of murderous fury is invested by him with a realism that is almost horrible. It was difficult to assess the performance of Miss Marie Ney because it was difficult to believe that she would ever have placed herself in such a situation.\\"The Scotsman 1 April 1936 (Page 16) Credits of the London production * Director: Murray MacDonald * Frank Vosper as Bruce Lovell * Muriel Aked as Louise Garrard * Norah Howard as Mavis Wilson * Marie Ney as Cecily Harrington * Geoffrey King as Nigel Lawrence * Charles Hodges as Hodgson * Esma Cannon as Ethel * S Major Jones as Dr. Gribble Broadway production Vosper took the play to New York where it ran from 21 September to c. 1 November 1936 for 38 performances.

Today, it has been almost completely reconstructed to form the South Dock of the West India Docks. History The West India Docks Act of 1799 allowed the City of London Corporation to construct a canal from Limehouse Reach to Blackwall Reach, across the Isle of Dogs.Canals and distribution It was intended to provide a short cut for sailing ships, to save them travelling around the south of the Isle of Dogs to access the wharves in the upper reaches of the river. If winds were unfavourable, this journey could take some time. The idea had been suggested by Ralph Walker in 1796. The West India merchants employed him as an engineer, and with assistance from William Jessop, John Foulds and George Dance, who was the City of London's surveyor, he produced the detailed plans which enabled the Act of Parliament to be obtained. Jessop was appointed as engineer with Walker as resident engineer, in August 1799, but Walker departed in 1802 after a disagreement with Jessop following a structural failure of part of the works. The canal was long with a surface width of and a depth of . The two locks were , with the floors built as inverted arches. The lock walls were thick, built of bricks with a stone facing. The depth over the lock cills varied between at high tide, allowing ships of up to 500 tons burden to use the canal. Banks high had to be built, because the high tide level was above that of the surrounding land, and the tops were above water level. The surrounding land also had to be raised to the same height. One of the major contractors was John Dyson Jr., who was based at Newington near Bawtry in South Yorkshire at the time. He was awarded a contract for excavation of the canal in 1800, and another for gravel extraction from 1801 to 1805. A third contract, for excavation of the west lock was awarded in 1803. He was working on the lock walls in December 1802, and had moved his family to Mile End by this date. John Torr Foulds acted as assistant engineer for part of this period, from 1800 to 1802. James Spedding was employed in 1805 to construct coffer dams to allow the wing walls at the ends of the canal to be built. A dam he had built in the previous year for the East India Dock had partially failed after four weeks, but had been repaired. The problem was one of design rather than bad workmanship, and the City Canal dam worked successfully. The canal was completed in 1805 (officially opened on 9 December that year), having incorporated at its western end the Breach Dockyard, a mast and timber laying dock formed around a large linear pond.London Thames Gateway Forum - Heritage The canal cost ¬£168,813, including the acquisition of land. East Indiamen at City Canal, circa 1824 However, access to the canal was determined by the state of the tide and the transit slow. These factors meant the canal was not a financial success since the owners did not charge tolls. It soon became a liability and was sold, for ¬£120,000, to the West India Dock Company, owner of the adjacent West India Docks, in 1829. The company bought it mainly to prevent it from falling into other hands. Proposals for collier docks immediately south of the City Canal, and the opening of the St Katharine Docks in 1828, had heightened the company's awareness of the threat represented by other dock interests. They added a timber dock to the south of the canal in 1832‚Äì3, the last major building work at the docks for 20 years. Some 30 years later (1866‚Äì70), in a scheme managed by engineer Sir John Hawkshaw, the canal was enlarged, the entrances were widened, and the complex was renamed the South West India Dock,West India Docks (1803-1980) Building the docks later known as South Dock. In 1926 it was decided that the South Dock should be connected to the West India import and export docks and to the Millwall Dock. The developments - a new South Dock east entrance lock and three passages to link the Millwall, South, Export and Import Docks - were divided into four contracts, and were completed in 1931 at a final cost of ¬£1,311,981 for the dock works, considerably improving access to the docks. Today South Dock regularly plays host to medium-sized military vessels visiting London as it is the furthest point upstream that they can be turned around - courtesy of the reconstruction worked carried out in 1926-1931. There is no longer a route for vessels across the Isle of Dogs - only the reconstructed eastern entrance remains.

Winnecunnet Pond or Winneconnet Pond or Winnecunnett Pond, very often called Lake Winnecunnet or Lake Winneconnet or Lake Winnecunnett although it is a pond rather than a lake, is a body of water in Norton, Massachusetts, United States. These spelling and naming variations occurs even in municipal publications and local newspapers. \\"Winneconnet Pond\\" and \\"Lake Winnecunnett\\" are the two most common versions. Locals tend to refer to it as a lake (as might be indicated by its area) rather than a pond (which it is because of its shallow depth). The name also lends itself to the residential area around the pond. \\"Winnecunnett\\" (in its various spellings) may be an Algonquian word meaning \\"beautiful place in the pines\\". The supposed translation of the name comes from \\"The Drama of Winnacunnet\\", a 1938 production concerning Hampton, New Hampshire. Note however that translations of Native American words from this period are often regarded as fanciful. Location This 19th-century map shows Winneconnet Pond and surrounding area. Located on the east side of town (on the north side of I-495), Winneconnet Pond is fed by the Canoe River and Mulberry Meadow Brook (sometimes simply called \\"Mulberry Brook\\" and referred to in an 1890 document as \\"Leach's Stream\\"Cape Cod History 1980). Winneconnet Pond feeds into a portion of the Mill River known as the \\"Snake River\\" before the Mill River feeds into the Taunton River.

IGN said that this game started the wave of \\"shovelware\\" on the Wii, criticizing the graphics and the mini-games. Many places gave this game a 1 out of 10: Eurogamer criticized the graphics and the fun factor of the game, saying \\"The Game Party experience is like going to a party where there's nothing to drink but Tesco Value brandy and there are only four other guests and they're all racist and then your ex turns up and gets off with a Danish supermodel.\\" AceGamez criticized the controls and said that the game is trying to simulate the fun of games like WarioWare: Smooth Moves, unsuccessfully. Sales The first Game Party received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. On February 12, 2009, Midway Games announced the Game Party series had sold over 3 million units.

The frequency of investment is usually weekly, monthly or quarterly. Overview In SIPs, a fixed amount of money is debited by the investors in bank accounts periodically and invested in a specified mutual fund. The investor is allocated a number of units according to the current Net asset value. Every time a sum is invested, more units are added to the investors account. The strategy claims to free the investors from speculating in volatile markets by dollar cost averaging. As the investor is getting more units when the price is low and fewer units when the price is high, in the long run, the average cost per unit is supposed to be lower. SIP claims to encourage disciplined investment. SIPs are flexible; the investors may stop investing a plan anytime or may choose to increase or decrease the investment amount. SIP is usually recommended to retail investors who do not have the resources to pursue the active investment. In India In India, a recurring payment can be set for SIP using Electronic Clearing Services (ECS). Some mutual funds allow tax benefits under equity-linked savings schemes.

History  The site was originally an oratory or place of prayer and was founded by Saint Aedan of Ferns, who founded several churches in Wales and was also known as St Aidan of Llawhaden.

A sideblog is meant to illustrate your immediate thoughts, movements or status update, and is usually less than 200 characters. Where a blog post may be compared to a newspaper opinion piece, a sideblog would be akin to the \\"news in brief\\" column.

Using the same tools, one can post to one's micro-blog and to one's sideblog simultaneously. Most sideblogs are actually embedded micro-blogs that appear in a small sidebar box next to the main blog posts and use feeds or plugins to display the content.

The townland incorporates an area of .  Topography  Glencastle, D√∫n Domhnaill fort Glencastle is a mountain valley which used to be known as the gateway to the Mullet Peninsula. In the middle of this glen stands an ancient fort called \\"Dun Donnell\\" or the fort of Domhnall. Domhnall was, according to legend, of the Gamanraige tribe and an ascendant of an Ailill Finn the husband of Flidhais and involved in the tale of T√°in B√≥ Flidhais. There are views of Broadhaven Bay and Blacksod Bay from the fort. As part of the cycle of Celtic folklore and legends, Domhnall used to close the gates of Erris at night levying tolls on passers-by. The remains of this fortification are now three large mounds which have never been archaeologically investigated.  History  The O'Caithnaidhs, who were chiefs of Erris before the Norman Invasion in the 12th century AD, had their stronghold in Glencastle. They were defeated by the O'Connors who then took over the fort until 1303 when it was conquered by the Barrett Normans. In 1540 the Barrett's castle in Glencastle was so well known that the English called Erris, 'Arrus Dundohmnaill'. For the next two hundred years, the Barretts wielded their influence in Church and civil affairs. There are several earlier archaeological monuments recorded in this village, but with the landscape destruction of the 21st century, it is doubtful if these are still in existence. It is recorded by engineer Patrick Knight that when the Belmullet/Bangor road was being made in the 1820s, that they \\"unnecessarily destroyed the fine dolmen in the glen rather than divert the road a few feet to one side\\". Thomas Johnson Westropp, a purveyor of antiquities on the western seaboard, who visited the Erris area in the early 20th century wrote the following of Glencastle in 1911: :\\"It is a beautiful spot, especially after the dreary drive through barren moors from Crossmolina through Bangor. We suddenly dip into a stream runnel and, without preparation drop into a lovely wooded glen, at first so narrow that there is barely room for the road and the brook; we pass a regular brown dyke of volcanic rock and a thickly-wooded hillside, hovered over by hawks, and reach the more open valley, the 'Gates of Erris'. In its centre a grassy moat-like mass of rock was upheaved by some remote eruption. The east face is covered with hazels and birch, the upper trees growing out of the side to keep the shelter of the fort rising over 90 feet above the stream. To the north, a great mountain swells up for 760 feet facing the glen and its keeper. A second mound, like an overturned boat lies further down the valley\\"  References  * Knight, Patrick.

It was a civilian version of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber. Design and development It was a monoplane, with retractable undercarriage, and a slim fuselage. Though the cabin was provided with heaters, oxygen provision and sound insulation it was only large enough for the 4 crew and four to 10 passengers. The construction was of mixed materials in the typical Savoia-Marchetti style of the time: steel tubes for the fuselage, wood for the wings, and the outer skin made up of wood, fabric or metal. The wings had slats. The powerplant was three AR.126 engines giving a total of about 2,300 hp. The maximum range stated was . The maximum speed was slightly better than the bomber at due to the absence of the gondola and hump machine gun positions. First flying on 19 November 1937, it entered into production for LATI, SABENA and other companies, but it had less success compared to the more economic and capable 18 seater Savoia-Marchetti S.73 even if had much improved performance. As a result, only 23 were built in two main series. Service When war broke out, the Italian aircraft were impressed into the Regia Aeronautica, and used in transport units.

Life and career  Fran√ßois de Castellane-Ornano-Adh√©mar de Monteil de Grignan was born in the Proven√ßal village of Grignan in 1632. He was the eldest of 11 children. At the death of his father, on 4 August 1668, he inherited the title of Count of Grignan. While still young, he engaged upon a military career. In 1654, he became colonel of the Champagne Regiment. Two years later, he became Capitaine-Lieutenant of the soldiers of the Household Cavalry of Queen Anne. He was married three times, first to Ang√©lique-Claire d'Angennes, daughter of the Marquis de Rambouillet. They had two daughters, then Ang√©lique died in 1665. One year later, Grignan married Marie-Ang√©lique du Puy-du-Fou, who died shortly after giving birth to a son, who died in infancy. As a 36-year-old twice-widower, he met and fell in love with the 23-year-old daughter of the illustrious Madame de S√©vign√©, Fran√ßoise-Marguerite de S√©vign√©. On 4 December 1668, Madame de S√©vign√© wrote to her cousin Bussy, ‚ÄúAt long last, the prettiest girl in France is marrying ‚Äì not the prettiest boy ‚Äì but one of the most honest men in the kingdom: he is Monsieur de Grignan.‚Äù Letter from Madame de S√©vign√© to Bussy-Rabutin, 4 December 1668. Grignan was indeed remarkably ugly (his ugliness being a frequent family joke) yet tall, graceful, athletic, and charming. He married Mademoiselle de S√©vign√© in Paris on 27 January 1669. That same year, Louis XIV named Grignan the lieutenant general of the King in Provence. Grignan was thus obliged to leave Paris and return to his family castle in the south of France. For nearly forty years afterward, he and Madame de Grignan lived an extravagant vice-regal existence in Provence. Every year, he presided at the opening of the Etats at Lambesc, seated on a throne-like chair with the Archbishop of Aix on his right and the Intendant of Provence on his left. In 1673, Grignan laid siege to the city of Orange, reclaiming the territory for France. Louis XIV upon hearing the news of Grignan's victory, was heard remarking at dinner \\"Je suis fort content de Grignan (I am very happy with Grignan).\\" Grignan died at the age of 83 at an inn on the road from Lambesc to Marseilles.

Its name is Hebrew for \\"Seekers of a Way.\\" The minyan is an affiliate of the Reconstructing Judaism. Early history The genesis of Dorshei Derekh goes back to the Germantown Minyan, started in 1974 by Rachel Falkove, Michael Masch, and others. Shortly after its first meeting it moved to Germantown Jewish Centre (which is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism). Dorshei Derekh's participatory, lay-led services, largely in Hebrew and including Torah discussions involving personal reflections, were part of a national trend of havurot and minyanim as alternatives to formal synagogue services. The minyan grew and attracted new residents to Mt. Airy. Within a few years, the minyan had up to 100 participants and divided into several minyanim, one of which was more traditional and one more flexible.Chava Weissler, \\"Worship in the Havura Movement\\" from \\"Making Davvening Meaningful: Worship in the Havurah Movement,\\" YIVO Annual 1990, based on her dissertation research, ca.1978-79. The article is reprinted in The Life of Judaism ed. Harvey E. Goldberg, University of California Press, 2001. Also see, Sidney H. Schwarz, \\"Changing Styles of Synagogue Life\\" in Philadelphia Jewish Life: 1940-1985 ed. Murray Friedman, (Seth Press, 1986; second ed. 2003, Temple University Press) After various changes and reorganizations, these two descendants of the Germantown Minyan formed minyanim that continue today. The more traditional group, dubbed the ‚Äú206 Minyan‚Äù after the room in which it davvened (prayed), changed rooms and renamed itself Minyan Masorti. The other group, more open to liturgical creativity, met biweekly. Some new members allied themselves with that minyan, and the combined group began meeting in the fall of 1986, settling on the name Dorshei Derekh. This choice was clearly influenced by the Jerusalem congregation Mevakshei Derech, a Reconstructionist-influenced community that was then independent (more recently affiliated with the Progressive/Reform movement).Judy Petsonk, Taking Judaism Personally: Creating a Meaningful Spiritual Life (The Free Press, 1996) includes a number of passages based on her experiences in the Germantown Minyan and Dorshei Derekh from the late 1970s to late 1980s. The Minyan Evolves The minyan went through a number of key decisions. One controversial issue in the mid-1990s was defining the role of non-Jewish family members and guests at services. A more involved decision was to formally affiliate with the Reconstructionist movement. This entailed defining minyan membership, establishing a formal decision-making process for controversial decisions, providing outside facilitators, and conducting discussions with Germantown Jewish Centre. After a lengthy process, the minyan joined the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (now Reconstructing Judaism) in 1999. Perhaps the greatest change from the 1970s or early 1980s has been the re-imagination of the Germantown Jewish Centre as a ‚Äúmulti- minyan‚Äù congregation. Dorshei Derekh is no longer viewed as ‚Äúthose other people‚Äù but as a key part of the congregation. Many Germantown Jewish Centre committee chairs, officers, and board members have come from Dorshei Derekh, including three recent congregational presidents, Helen Feinberg (2002-04), Rachel Falkove (2004-06), and Mitch Marcus (2012-14). In addition, minyan members are involved in education and social action projects with the wider congregation. The minyan itself has constituted a caring community, providing meals and other support for members with illness and at times of loss or of births. This support is based on community connection, not only on who is a close personal friend. The minyan has always attempted to welcome newcomers, but the transient situations of many in our community have made that challenging. The minyan has encouraged people to acquire new liturgical and leadership skills.David A. Teutsch, Spiritual Community: The Power to Resource Hope, Commitment, and Joy JewishLights Publishing, 2005 is in large part influenced by the experience of Dorshei Derekh and the Germantown Jewish Centre communities. For example, p.91 describes, only six months after arriving in Philadelphia, the presence of 120 people, \\"my family's community\\" at the naming ceremony for his newborn daughter. There have always been considerable numbers of people in the minyan with substantial Jewish knowledge, enriching the community. While many of these are Reconstructionist rabbis and rabbinical students, there are also very knowledgeable lay people. This has made it possible for many to take part in leading the group and in adding to the ideas in discussions. Germantown Minyan members were part of a network of East Coast havurot that met several times a year from the early 1970s until 1981 at Weiss‚Äô Farm in New Jersey and later at Fellowship Farm near Philadelphia. These networks formed a basis for the National Havurah Committee, and numerous Dorshei Derekh members have participated in NHC events and leadership. The minyan has organized its own in-town and out-of-town retreats a number of times, most recently in the fall of 2006. Customs and Practice Some practices inherited from the Germantown Minyan, or created in the early years, have influenced the minyan over two decades. Other minhagim (customs) grew over the decades. A few that are noteworthy include: a) Rotating leadership. The minyan coordinator (a chairperson) rotates every six months and with the past coordinator and coordinator-elect forms a three- person mazkirut (secretariat) for decisions that cannot wait. In general, the minyan coordinator position is filled alternately by women and men. b) Participatory decision-making is maintained through quarterly minyan meetings, though attendance is not usually large. Shabbat morning and festival services involve a number of key minhagim. The minyan arranges its space in a circle or semicircle, which emphasizes community rather than a leader. Services include a good deal of Hebrew, with English readings or interpretations sometimes added by a leader. Pesukei dezimra (introductory psalms) with much singing are often emphasized. The Amidah includes the matriarchs, and some participants phrase blessings in alternative or feminine Hebrew. At its Dec. 2, 2012 minyan meeting, Dorshei Derekh passed a proposal that allows service leaders to include Bilhah and Zilpah in the listing of the matriarchs, during the communal recitation of the Amidah. The Torah reading is done on a triennial cycle, typically with three (rather than seven) aliyot. A key part of the Torah service is the mi sheberakh blessings, as people volunteer for aliyot to mark events in their lives and receive recognition from the community: birthdays, new jobs, new academic ventures, arriving and departing for Israel, departing for college, a yahrzeit, a new apartment or home. These combined Hebrew and English individual prayers are a way the minyan shares news and support. While officially retaining it as an option, Dorshei Derekh generally omits the haftarah (prophetic reading) except for a few times a year. (The monthly women‚Äôs haftarah project in the 1990s was an exception.)Lori Lefkowitz, \\"Hidden Voices:Women's Haftarot\\" in Kerem #5, 1997, discusses the creation of a feminist series of monthly readings including poetry by women. A new set of blessings before and after the readings was created. Its omission allows for a longer Torah discussion, which follows a d‚Äôvar Torah. The minyan avoids centralized leadership in these discussions by having each speaker call on the next person. For 20 years, speakers alternated between men and women to assure gender equality, until this practice was suspended as an experiment in the summer of 2006. (If there were more women present than men, a step originated to advance women‚Äôs participation might actually limit it.) The Musaf service at Dorshei Derekh is an additional reading, poem, or story rather than another service. The service concludes with introductions, announcements, and a member-provided kiddush. Occasionally a longer lunch and discussion follow services. The minyan originally used the Conservative Silverman siddur with unwritten modifications, but after the Reconstructionist siddur Kol Haneshamah (edited by a minyan member, David Teutsch) was published in 1994, it was adopted by the minyan \\"as an experiment.\\" That \\"experiment\\" continues today.

Initially, the track stretched from H√§meenlinna to Lahti via Lammi. Since the original course went across several lakes and the ice quality varied from winter to winter, the race was later moved to a location near Lahti. The first ever Finlandia-hiihto was to have taken place on a course leading from H√§meenlinna to Hyvink√§√§. However, due to a lack of snow, the race had to be cancelled. The debut event took place the following year, 1974, with a 75-kilometre course from H√§meenlinna to Lahti. In 1976, the race already attracted 3,500 participants from 14 countries. Finlandia-hiihto has been a part of the Worldloppet series since it was founded for the 1978-1979 season. In 1982, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa from Japan took part in Finlandia-hiihto. That year also saw the number of participants exceed 10,000 for the first time. Two years later, with more than 13,000 participants, Finlandia-hiihto broke the Guinness World Record for the biggest mass skiing event in the world. In 1986, the use of the skating technique was allowed for the first time, but the ban was reintroduced in 1988. In 1990, a separate freestyle race was held on the day before the classic technique competition. The separate freestyle race was soon discontinued, but re-established in 2007. Due to poor snow conditions in the 1990s, the event had to be moved five times from H√§meenlinna to Lahti. Consequently, a decision was made to change the location permanently, and from 2001 onwards the Finlandia-hiihto has been raced on a course that takes the competitors from Lahti to Hollola and back. In 2011 Finlandia-hiihto became a part of the FIS Marathon Cup series, which boosted the prestige and visibility of the event. Over 7,000 skiers took part in the 40th anniversary event of Finlandia-hiihto in 2013. In the same year, the Finlandia Ski Team was founded. The team takes part in cross-country ski races and mass skiing events in Finland and other countries. The 2020 race had to be cancelled, for the 1st time in the event's history, due to lack of snow on account of the exceptionally mild winter in Finland.

Some items could be potentially useful for purposes that are contrary the interest of the exporting country. These items are considered to be controlled. The controlled items are prevented to some degree from being sent to destinations where it is perceived they will be used in a harmful way. Many governments in the world implement Export Controls. Typically there will be legislation that causes potential exporters of controlled items to make a request to a local government department, and that department will assess the desired exports and either grant or deny licences as appropriate.  History  Export control has been in place in the USA since the time of the American Revolution, although the modern export control regimes can be traced back to the Trading with Enemies Act in the USA in 1917, and the Import, Export and Customs Power (Defense) Act of UK in 1939 A significant piece of legislation was the USA Export Control Act of 1940 which inter alia aimed to restrict shipments of material to pre-war Japan.  Principles  In most export control regimes, there is legislation that lists many items which are deemed 'controlled', and lists destinations to which sending items is restricted, by different degrees. The lists of what is controlled sometimes arise from some Harmonised Regime. = Categorisation = Usually goods are subject to categorisation such as the USA's Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or India's SCOMET list or Japan's METI lists. Some items will be considered \\"Designed or modified for military use\\", some will be considered Dual Use, and some will not be export controlled. Dual Use means that the device has both a civilian and a military purpose. In several jurisdictions, the classifications will consider Goods, Equipment, Materials, Software and Technology. The last two are often considered intangible. Classifications may also be by destination purpose, including cryptography, Laser, and torture equipment. = Destination = Each exporting country will have different relationships with other countries as per International Relations. Sometimes countries will have Trade agreements or arrangements with a group of other countries, and this agreement means there are no licences required for certain goods. For example, within the EU licences are not required for shipping civilian goods to other member states, however for restricted, military goods licences are required. For any exporting country, some destination countries may be Sanctioned, some may require Licences, some may require record keeping (e.g. using an OGEL) and some have no restrictions. The End User of the goods, or some 'broker' will typically be declared, and similar restrictions apply as to countries. Some individuals or entities may be listed, so even if the item can could normally be sent to the country without a licence, additional restrictions apply for that individual or entity. = Licence = For any given item being exported, the categorisations will typically lead to different treatments for a given destination, e.g. 'No Licence Required' (NLR) or 'Licence Required'. When a licence is required, typically some declaration from the End user will be required. This could be an End User Undertaking (EUU), an End User Statement (EUS) or an End-user certificate. These EUUs will typically include intended use, and make assurances as to the applications for the goods, e.g. not to be used within missiles. Licences can subsequently be obtained from the appropriate government department in the exporter's jurisdiction.

He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2010. Ranjith previously served as auxiliary bishop of Colombo (1991‚Äì1995), Bishop of Ratnapura (1995‚Äì2001), Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (2001‚Äì2004), Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor (2004‚Äì2005), and Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (2005‚Äì2009). Early life and education The eldest of fourteen children, Malcolm Ranjith was born in Polgahawela to Don William and Mary Winifreeda. He studied at De La Salle College in Mutwal before entering St. Aloysius Seminary in Borella in 1965. From 1966 to 1970 he pursued studies in theology and philosophy at the National seminary in Kandy. He was thereafter sent by the then Archbishop Thomas Cooray to further his priestly studies in Rome. He graduated from the Pontifical Urbanian University with a Bachelor of Theology (B.Th.) degree. On 29 June 1975, Malcolm Ranjith was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter's Square. Later he joined the tutorial staff of St. Thomas' College, Kotte, before pursuing post graduate studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, from where he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1978; his thesis centered on the Epistle to the Hebrews. During his time at the Biblical Institute, he studied under Carlo Martini and Albert Vanhoye (both future cardinals), He also attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he undertook scriptural research as a postgraduate student. Priestly ministry Upon his return to Sri Lanka, Ranjith became an assistant parish priest in Pamunugama in 1978, later serving as a parish priest in Payagala and Kalutara. His pastoral work among the poor but religious people in these fishing villages led him to become involved with social justice. He also established \\"Seth Sarana\\", a center for relief of the poor in the Archdiocese of Colombo. He once said that \\"love for the liturgy and love for the poor ... have been the compass of my life as a priest.\\" In 1983, Ranjith was named the National Director of Pontifical Mission Societies. He revived the Society of the Holy Childhood and, as Diocesan Co-ordinator for Human Development, he introduced bold initiatives in areas such as housing, fisheries, and various self-employment projects. Episcopal career =Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo= On 17 June 1991, Ranjith was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo and Titular Bishop of Cabarsussi. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 31 August from Archbishop Nicholas Marcus Fernando, with Bishops Thomas Savundaranayagam and Oswald Gomis serving as co-consecrators. He served as the Vicar General in charge of Parochial Apostolate and Lay Apostolate from 1991 to 1995. His peers elected him the Secretary General of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka as well. He was Chairman of the Organising Committee for the Beatification of Ven. Joseph Vaz and the visit of Pope John Paul II to Sri Lanka in January 1995. In 1994, Ranjith led a commission that denounced the theological work of Sri Lankan theologian Tissa Balasuriya. He charged that he had questioned original sin and the divinity of Christ, as well as supporting women's ordination. Ranjith was supported by then-Cardinal Ratzinger, who backed his position. =First Bishop of Ratnapura= Ranjith was appointed bishop by the Holy See to the newly created Diocese of Ratnapura, taking office on 2 November 1995. His appointment was hailed as a welcome spark to kindle the fire of missionary zeal in the hearts of the clergy and laity in his diocese. Ranjith promoted inter-faith dialogue in Sri Lanka, as he believes it can eliminate potential causes of tensions and disagreements between the religious and ethnic groups that make up the country. He once said that \\"dialogue is vital and fundamental and as Catholics we must celebrate the richness of the Word of God incarnate in our life, families and communities\\". =Adjunct Secretary= Ranjith is also the first Sri Lankan Bishop to be appointed to the Holy See's civil service. On 1 October 2001, he was named Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and simultaneously appointed President of the Pontifical Mission Societies by Pope John Paul II. It is the Pope's ministry for the coordination of the missionary efforts of the Church and involves overview and growth of the local Churches in mission countries. This Ministry coordinates over 1100 Archdioceses, Dioceses, Apostolic Vicarates and Apostolic Prefectures as well as Sui Juris Missions. The Adjunct Secretary is the President of the Pontifical Mission Societies, which are the instruments of the Pope for enhancing support through prayer and contributions for the mission of the Church. =Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor= Ranjith is the first Sri Lankan bishop to be appointed an Apostolic Nuncio. He was appointed titular archbishop of Umbriatico and the Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and to East Timor on 29 April 2004. During his tenure as Apostolic Nuncio he was instrumental in enhancing mutual relations between the Holy See and Indonesia. He won the admiration of the Church hierarchy for the important role he played in assisting the establishment of cordial relations between the local Churches and government authorities, whilst ensuring respect for the rights of the local Catholic Church throughout the country. =Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship= Archbishop Ranjith was appointed Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on 10 December 2005. He once described the liturgical reforms inspired by the Second Vatican Council as \\"a mixed bag of results.\\" While praising the use of vernacular languages, he also criticized the \\"quasi total abandonment\\" of Latin and the \\"acceptance of all kinds of 'novelties' resulting from a secularizing and humanistic theological and liturgical mindset overtaking the West.\\" He has also lamented the \\"banalization and obscuring of the mystical and sacred aspects of the liturgy in many areas of the Church in the name of a so-called Konzilsgeist (spirit of the Council).\\" Ranjith opposes the reception of Communion in the hand and standing, once saying, \\"I think it is high time to ... abandon the current practice that was not called for by Sacrosanctum Concilium, nor by Fathers, but was only accepted after its illegitimate introduction in some countries.\\" A staunch supporter of the Tridentine Mass, Ranjith once said that bishops who opposed Summorum Pontificum were allowing themselves to be \\"used as instruments of the devil,\\" accusing them of \\"disobedience ... and even rebellion against the Pope.\\" He once said, \\"I'm not a fan of the Lefebvrians ... but what they sometimes say about the liturgy they say for good reason.\\" Archbishop Ranjith is fluent in ten languages; Italian, German, French, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, English, Sinhala and Tamil. =Archbishop of Colombo= On 16 June 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo, naming Joseph Di Noia as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. In a letter to Archbishop Ranjith, Pope Benedict said, \\"I wish to express my sincere thanks for the fidelity, the commitment and competence with which you exercised that [Divine Worship secretary] office.\\" Pope Benedict also expressed that \\"we have reason to be encouraged by the good you will be able to perform among the peoples of your land.\\" Archbishop Ranjith was among 34 metropolitan archbishops to receive his pallium from Pope Benedict on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June 2009. The Archbishop was greeted with warmth and solemnity upon his arrival in Sri Lanka on 31 July 2009. Upon his arrival he was received by the President of Sri Lanka, such high-profile reception being due to the status of the Archbishops of Colombo as leaders (Metropolites) of the Catholic community in the country. Archbishop Ranjith took formal canonical possession of the Metropolitan See of Colombo in a private ceremony on 5 August 2009 and celebrated the Mass for the solemn beginning of his pastoral ministry as Archbishop of Colombo on 8 August 2009, when he was publicly installed in the cathedra of the Archbishops of Colombo. On 7 October 2009, Archbishop Ranjith issued new liturgical guidelines in his diocese. These include a recommendation for \\"all faithful, including the religious, to receive Holy Communion reverently kneeling and on the tongue\\", as well as laymen being forbidden from preaching. In addition to this, priests are forbidden to bring elements or styles of worship from other religions into the liturgy. In April 2010, Archbishop Ranjith was elected and took office as President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka. =Cardinal= On 20 October 2010, Pope Benedict XVI announced a Consistory for the creation of new Cardinals to be held on 20 November 2010, and made public the names of 24 Prelates he intended to raise to the Cardinalate on that occasion, Archbishop Ranjith being among those chosen for promotion to the Sacred College. Accordingly, Archbishop Ranjith was created a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church at the Consistory of 20 November 2010, and was assigned the title of Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina. On 13 February 2011 Cardinal Ranjith took possession of his titular church in Rome. Cardinal Ranjith participated as a cardinal- elector in the 2013 conclave which elected Pope Francis. In addition to serving as archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith serves as a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. These memberships will be renewed every five years until his 80th birthday when he loses them on the same day he loses the right to vote in a conclave.

It was first performed in 1912. Plot The play is set in the fictional mill town of Hindle in Lancashire in England, and concerns two young persons, Fanny Hawthorn and Alan Jeffcote, who are discovered to have been having what would now be called a \\"dirty weekend\\" during their holiday, during the town's wakes week. Class is a major plot point in the play; Fanny is a mill-hand in the factory owned by Alan's father and their respective fathers once worked together before Mr Jeffcote senior rose to owning a mill, while Mr Hawthorn continued as a mill worker. After initial reluctance on the part of Mr Jeffcote senior, and the outright opposition of his wife (who suspects Fanny of being a gold-digger), the families pressure the couple to get married. Greatly to the surprise of everyone (including Alan) Fanny refuses. She makes it clear that she regarded the dalliance with Alan as \\"a bit of fun\\" and considers him a poor choice for a husband. She is disowned by her people but expresses confidence that her skills as a weaver will allow her to support herself in the future. Performances Em√©lie Polini as Fanny Hawthorn in the Broadway production of Hindle Wakes (1912) It was first performed in 1912 by Annie Horniman's Gaiety Theatre company, originally in Manchester and then in London and on Broadway. The character Fanny Hawthorn was played by Edyth Goodall in the original production. It was a controversial piece at the time it was first produced, and provoked a prolonged correspondence in the Pall Mall Gazette in which both the author, Stanley Houghton, and the original actress participated, with many correspondents questioning whether the play's treatment of non-marital sex would set a bad example. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford placed all the theatres performing it out of bounds to students. Pogson: Miss Horniman and the Gaiety Theatre Manchester. Rockliff Publishing Corporation Ltd (1952) It was the play in performance at the Royal Exchange Theatre during the 1996 Manchester bombing and the play with which the theatre reopened in December 1998 after almost two-and-a-half years of repair works following the bomb damage. Both productions were directed by Helena Kaut-Howson with Ewan Hooper as Mr Jeffcote, Sue Johnston as Mrs Jeffcote, Colin Prockter as Mr Hawthorn, Nicholas Gleaves as Alan Jeffcote and Sophie Stanton as Fanny Hawthorn. The production won a MEN Award. The 100th anniversary of Stanley Houghton's Hindle Wakes was marked in 2012. In September 2012, the first London revival in over 30 years took place at Finborough Theatre (Earls Court) from the 11th to the 29th. It has been filmed four times, twice in the silent era (1918, 1927), and twice in the sound era (1931, 1952) although the film versions have tended to open out the play considerably. A version of it featured in the series Laurence Olivier Presents (1976), starring Judi Bowker, Donald Pleasence, Trevor Eve and co-directed by Laurence Olivier and June Howson. The 1931 film starred Belle Chrystal as the mill girl and John Stuart as the employer's son, with Sybil Thorndike, Edmund Gwenn and Norman McKinnel. Parts of it were filmed in Blackpool.

Due to increasing demands within the field of automation technology in the 1980s, such as increasing loads, moving cables guided inside cable carriers often failed, although the cable carriers themselves did not. In extreme cases, failures caused by \\"corkscrews\\" and core ruptures brought entire production lines to a standstill, at high cost. As a result, specialized, highly flexible cables were developed with unique characteristics to differentiate them from standard designs. These are sometimes called ‚Äúchain-suitable,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh-flex,‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous flex‚Äù cables. A higher level of flexibility means the service life of a cable inside a cable carrier can be greatly extended. A normal cable typically manages 50,000 cycles, but a dynamic cable can complete between one and three million cycles. Here the cable conductors are braided  Construction  Flexible cables can be divided into two types: those with conductors stranded in layers inside the cable, and those that have bundled or braided conductors. =Stranding in layers= Stranding in layers is easier to produce, and therefore usually less expensive. The cable cores are stranded firmly and left relatively long in several layers around the center and are then enclosed in an extruded tube shaped jacket. In the case of shielded cables, the cores are wrapped up with fleece or foils. However, this type of construction means that, during the bending process, the inner radius compresses and the outer radius stretches as the cable core moves. Initially, this works quite well, because the elasticity of the material is still sufficient, but material fatigue can set in and cause permanent deformations. The cores move and begin to make their own compressing and stretching zones, which can lead to a ‚Äúcorkscrew‚Äù shape, and ultimately, core rupture. =Stranding in bundles= The unique cable construction technique of braiding conductors around a tension-proof centre instead of layering them is the second type of construction. Eliminating multi-layers guarantees a uniform bend radius across each conductor. At any point where the cable flexes, the path of any core moves quickly from the inside to the outside of the cable. The result is that no single core compresses near the inside of the bend or stretches near the outside of the bend--which reduces overall stresses. An outer jacket is still required to prevent the cores untwisting. A pressure filled jacket, rather than a simple extruded jacket, is preferable here. This fills all the gussets around the cores and ensures that the cores cannot untwist. The resulting dynamic cable is often stiffer than a standard cable, but lasts longer in applications where it must constantly flex.

He is perhaps best known as the general editor of The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, \\"the international authority\\".Gay, P., Freud: A Life for our Time (New York & London: W. W. Norton & Company, 1998), p. 741. Early life He was a son of Lt-Gen Sir Richard Strachey and Lady (Jane) Strachey, called the enfant miracle as his father was 70 and his mother 47. Some of his nieces and nephews, who were considerably older than James, called him Jembeau or Uncle Baby. His parents had thirteen children, of whom ten lived to adulthood. He was educated at Hillbrow preparatory school in Rugby and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took over the rooms used by his older brother Lytton Strachey, and was known as \\"the Little Strachey\\"; Lytton was now \\"the Great Strachey\\". At Cambridge, Strachey fell deeply in love with the poet Rupert Brooke, who did not return his affections. He was himself pursued by mountaineer George Mallory, by Harry Norton and by economist John Maynard Keynes, with whom he also had an affair. His love of Brooke was a constant, however, until the latter's death in 1915, which left Strachey \\"shattered\\". On the imposition of military conscription in 1916, during World War I, James became a conscientious objector. James was assistant editor of The Spectator, and a member of the Bloomsbury Group or \\"Bloomsberries\\" when he became familiar with Alix Sargant Florence, though they first met in 1910. They moved in together in 1919 and married in 1920. Soon afterwards they moved to Vienna, where James began a psychoanalysis with Freud, of whom he was a great admirer. He would claim to Lytton that his analysis \\"provided 'a complete undercurrent for life'\\".Lisa Appignanesi and John Forrester, Freud's Women (London 1993), p. 367 Freud asked the couple to translate some of his works into English, and this became their lives' work: they became ‚Äúmy excellent English translators, Mr and Mrs James Strachey‚Äù.Freud, quoted in Appignanesi, p. 368. The psychoanalytic turn Looking back forty years later at this turning-point, Strachey commented in a 'disarming passage' to his fellow analysts on his then qualifications as a psychoanalytic candidate, as compared to modern times: 'A discreditable academic career with the barest of B. A. degrees, no medical qualifications...no experience of anything except third-rate journalism. The only thing in my favour was that at the age of thirty I wrote a letter out of the blue to Freud, asking him if he would take me on as a student'.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988), p. 166‚Äì7. He continued by saying that, having spent a couple of years in Vienna, ‚ÄúI got back to London in the summer of 1922, and in October, without any further ado, I was elected an associate member of the [Psycho-Analytical] Society. ... A year later, I was made a full member. So there I was, launched on the treatment of patients, with no experience, with no supervision, with nothing to help me but some two years of analysis with Freud\\".Malcolm, p. 167. He concluded wryly that the modern \\"curriculum vitae is essential. Whether it is possible for it to become over-institutionalized is an open question. Is it worthwhile to leave a loophole for an occasional maverick? ... if the curriculum vitae had existed forty years ago, you wouldn't have had to listen to these remarks tonight\\". Nevertheless, Freud had decided that \\"the Stracheys should become members (full) of the Society. ... To be sure their conflicts have not been decided, but we need not wait so long, we can only instigate the processus which has to be fed by the factors of life\\".Freud to Jones, in Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, Freud's Women (London 1993), p. 368. James and Alix thus both become practising analysts; James subsequently began publishing his own original articles; and the two of them (in collaboration with Jones and Joan Riviere) began translating Freud's works in earnest, as well as writings by a number of other European psychoanalysts such as Karl Abraham. Their translation of Freud's works, in twenty-four volumes, remains the standard edition of Freud's works to this day, and according to Michael Holroyd a German publishing house considered retranslating their translation of the Master's works back into German, because they were a work of art and scholarship, with a maze of additional footnotes and introductions. While the Stracheys were instrumental in encouraging Melanie Klein to come to England to pursue her analytic discoveries, both remained loyal to Freud at the same time, and stood as part of the Middle Group in the wartime Controversial discussions between the proponents of Melanie Klein and of Anna Freud. 'James Strachey characterised the battle between the two women in his own wryly sensible way: \\"My own view is that Mrs K. has made some highly important contributions ... but that it‚Äôs absurd to make out (a) that they cover the whole subject or (b) that their validity is axiomatic. On the other hand, I think it is equally ludicrous for Miss F. to maintain that [Psychoanalysis] is a Game Preserve belonging to the F. family\\".Appignanesi, p. 298‚Äì9. Psychoanalytic writings Strachey published three articles in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis between 1930 and 1935. In the first, on \\"Some Unconscious Factors in Reading\\"[1930], he explored the 'oral ambitions...[in] \\"taking in\\" words, by hearing or reading, both unconsciously meaning \\"eating\\"'Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 315. ‚Äì something of central significance 'for reading addictions as well as for neurotic disturbances of reading'.Fenichel, p. 381 In his 1931 article on the \\"Precipitating Factor in the Etiology of the Neuroses\\", Strachey examined those 'experiences that disturb the equilibrium between warded-of impulses and warding-off forces, an equilibrium hitherto relatively stable'.Fenichel, p. 455. His most important contribution, however, was that of 1934 on \\"The Nature of the Therapeutic Action of Psychoanalysis\\" ‚Äì a seminal article arguing that \\"the fact that the pathogenic conflicts, revived in the transference, are now experienced in their full emotional content makes the transference interpretation so much more effective than any other interpretation\\".Fenichel, p. 571. Half a century later, the role of \\"mutative transference interpretations as described by Strachey (1934)\\"Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient. London 1960, p. 181. was still serving as a starting-point for discussion. His 1962 \\"Sketch\\" of Freud's life and work, which serves as an introduction to the Penguin Freud Library, is a genial but wide-ranging survey ‚Äì grounded in his intimate knowledge of the Freudian corpus, but perhaps with somewhat of the spirit he himself observed in Martin Freud's memoir of his father, Glory Reflected: \\"this delightful and amusing book serves to redress the balance from more official biographies ... and reveals something of Freud as he was in ordinary life\\".Angela Richards ed., Case Histories II (Penguin 1991), p. 24. The translations In one of his last letters to Freud, Ernest Jones wrote that 'You probably know you have the reputation of not being the easiest author to translate'.Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (London 1994), p. 114. Certainly when translation into English first began, 'the earliest versions were not always felicitous ... casual and at times fearfully inaccurate'.Gay, p. 465. With the coming of the Stracheys, however, 'translations began to improve: in 1924 and 1925, a small English team brought out Freud's Collected Papers, in four volumes' which have been described as 'the most vigorous translations into English'Gay, p. 465 and p. 741. of all time. Nevertheless, the 24 volume Standard Edition remains Strachey's crowning glory. 'It is a heroic enterprise. Where necessary, it offers variorum texts; it wrestles with intractable material ... and it introduces each work, even the slightest paper, with indispensable bibliographical and historical information'.Gay, p. 741. The most 'obvious flaw in this translation was the substitution of esoteric neologisms for the plain German terms Freud preferred',Gay, p. 465n. so that for example his \\"I\\" and his \\"It\\" become the Ego and the Id. Lacan took particular exception to \\"the translation of instinct for Trieb [drive] ... thus basing the whole edition on a complete misunderstanding since Trieb and instinct have nothing in common\\".Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (London 1994) p. 49 Bruno Bettelheim went still further, arguing that \\"anyone who reads Freud only in Strachey's English translation cannot understand Freud's concern with man's soul\\". While accepting that \\"Strachey's translation was also an act of interpretation and it has not been hard to find spots where he went astray\\", the fact remains that \\"Freud was delighted with the work Strachey succeeded in doing\\"; whilst even into the twenty-first century \\"the German editions have relied on Strachey's editorial apparatus, which should be a testimony to what he accomplished\\".Paul Roazen, The Historiography of Psychoanalysis (2001), p. 409. James Strachey, Michael Holroyd, and \\"Lytton Strachey\\" James is mentioned in the text of Holroyd's biography of Lytton Strachey, and in the introduction to the 1971 Penguin edition and the 1994‚Äì95 revised edition. James was the literary executor for his brother Lytton, so Holroyd saw James and Alix frequently over the five years from 1962 that he was researching and writing the first edition (published in 1967‚Äì68) of his biography of Lytton. He describes James as \\"almost an exact replica of Freud himself, though with some traces of Lytton's physiognomy ‚Äì the slightly bulbous nose in particular. He wore a short white beard because, he told me, of the difficulty of shaving. He had had it now for some fifty years. He also wore spectacles, one lens of which was transparent, the other translucent. It was only later that I learnt he had overcome with extraordinary patience a series of eye operations that had threatened to put an end to his magnum opus\\". James made many objections to Holroyd's initial drafts of the biography, and \\"Holroyd made the brilliant decision to publish James's acid- sounding comments as footnotes on the pages. ... James's testy objections helped liven up the text\\".Roazen, p. 146. James was also an authority on Haydn, Mozart and Wagner, and contributed notes and commentaries to Glyndebourne programmes.

They were among the earliest Druze settlers in Jabal Hauran and were the dominant local force in that region between their establishment there in 1711 and circa 1860, when the al-Atrash clan became the prominent Druze power. History =Rule in Jabal Hauran= The Al Hamdan claim descent from the Hamdanids (Banu Hamdan), an Arab dynasty that governed much of northern Syria during Fatimid rule in the 10th century.Firro, 1992, p. 40. This claim is accepted by 20th-century French historian N. Bouron and Druze historian A. Najjar. However, Druze historian Kais Firro views the claim of Hamdanid descent as skeptical and believes the Al Hamdan invented and spread it to boost their legitimacy as leaders of the Druze community, which generally held great respect for noble genealogy. According to Al Hamdan tradition, members of the family adopted the Druze faith during the Fatimid era, and migrated to Mount Lebanon during the Fatimid decline in Syria. However, early Druze chronicles do not mention conversion to the Druze religion among any members of the Hamdanid dynasty. In Mount Lebanon, the Al Hamdan were based in the village of Kafra.Firro 1992, p. 42. Following the 1711 Battle of Ain Dara between the rival Qaysi and Yamani factions of the Druze, in which the Yamani were routed, the latter faction began a mass exodus to the Hauran from Mount Lebanon.Firro 1992, p. 37. The Al Hamdan were part of this migration. At the time of the migration, a small Druze community was present in Hauran and led by the Alam al-Dins, a Yamani princely family from Mount Lebanon. When the Alam al-Dins returned to Mount Lebanon to fight alongside his Yamani kinsmen in 1711, leadership of the Hauran Druze passed to the Al Hamdan. The clan was headquartered in the village of Najran, situated at the western edge of the Lejah plain, and also controlled five villages in the vicinity. The Al Hamdan's ancestral village of Kafra was destroyed in a snowstorm in the early 18th century, prompting its inhabitants to join the Al Hamdan in Hauran. The Al Hamdan continued to have branches in the Gharb district of Mount Lebanon and in the Galilee. Khalil al-Hamdan, a member of the family from the Galilee moved to Hauran and strengthened the rule of his kinsman Hamdan al-Hamdan. During the 1837‚Äì1838 Druze revolt against Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, the governor of Syria, the Druze were led by Yahya al-Hamdan, who was the leading sheikh (chieftain) of Jabal Hauran. Between 1852 and 1857, Ismail al-Atrash, a Druze sheikh based in al-Qurayya, became the virtual military chief of the Jabal Hauran Druze at the expense of Al Hamdan's authority.Firro 1992, p. 189. Ismail's rise and rivalry with the Al Hamdan divided the Druze into two factions, with most of the long-established Druze families backing the Al Hamdan and the newer migrants supporting Bani al- Atrash.Firro 1992, p. 187. The preeminent sheikh of the Al Hamdan at the time was Wakid al-Hamdan. In 1856, the sheikhs of the Bani Amer, Abu Fakhr, Abu Assaf, Al Hanaydi and Al Azzam clans petitioned the Ottoman governor of Damascus to appoint Wakil as \\"first sheikh\\" of Jabal Hauran in their bid to stem al-Atrash power. The following year, Ismail al-Atrash captured the Al Hamdan's secondary village, 'Ira, and drove out its sheikh Hazza al-Hamdan, Wakid's brother. =Decline= By 1860, the Al Hamdan lost their position of power in Jabal Hauran and became largely dependent on the more powerful Bani Amer.Firro 1992, p. 190. By 1862, the Al Hamdan had lost Qanawat, which no longer came under any one particular family's rule, but rather served as the headquarters of the Druze shaykh al-aql (religious leader), Sheikh Husayn al- Hajari. To make up for losing Qanawat, the Al Hamdan captured the villages of Aslihah in the Hauran plain and Masad south of as-Suwayda.Firro 1992, p. 184. The Al Hamdan controlled five villages in Jabal Hauran in 1868.Firro 1992, p. 192. The clan sided with the Bedouin Sulut tribe in their war against Ismail al-Atrash that year.

The village is designated as a Conservation Area.Adopted Unitary Development Plan It is now bisected by the motorway, which passes over the road through the village, with the original village located to the south and the more recent development, known as Newton Green, to the north. Almost adjoing Mathen, and within the community, is Pwllmeyric. Origins of the village An authoritative local historyE. T. Davies, A history of the Parish of Mathern, 1990 suggests that the settlement originates from a time when the St. Pierre Pill, an inlet off the Severn Estuary, was larger and much more important than now, and met an ancient ridgeway which passed through Shirenewton towards Monmouth. The inlet was originally known as Porthiscoed (\\"harbour below the woods\\"), which, as Portskewett, later became the name of a nearby village. Mathern was originally known as Merthyr-Tewdrig (\\"burial-place of Tewdrig\\"), after the martyrdom of St. Tewdrig, king of Gwent and Glywysing. According to the Book of Llandaff, Tewdrig (or Tewdric) was wounded at Tintern around the year 630, after fighting the invading Saxons with his son Meurig ap Tewdrig. His wounds were washed at a spring, where he died. A church was erected on the site of his burial at Mathern, and he was later revered as a martyr and saint.Kelly's Directory for Monmouthshire, 1901Wales In his memory, Meurig gave the surrounding land, extending for several miles, to the Bishops of Llandaff. During the 12th century, the shorter name Mateyrn, meaning \\"place of a king\\", came into common use for the village; Meurig's name is perpetuated in the neighbouring village of Pwllmeyric. Notable buildings =St Tewdric's Church= St Tewdric's church The existing parish church of St. Tewdric dates largely from the late 15th century, when it was rebuilt on an earlier foundation by John Marshall, Bishop of Llandaff, in the Perpendicular architectural style. However, parts dating from the 12th and 13th centuries are still visible. The church is the supposed resting place of St. Tewdric; on the north wall of the chancel is a tablet installed in the 17th century by Francis Godwin, Bishop of Llandaff 1601-1617, who claimed to have found the saint's stone coffin while repairing the church. The church also possesses several monuments to Bishops of Llandaff, up to the end of the 17th century. The building was heavily restored in the 1880s. Hando recounts the story told to him by an old lady who had lived in Mathern and who claimed to have seen for herself, in 1881, the stone coffin bearing the remains of St. Tewdrig with his mortal wound (a hole in the skull made by a spear-point) still visible.Hando, F. J., (1958) \\"Out and About in Monmouthshire\\", R. H. Johns, Newport. The medieval font was recovered from beneath the porch by Canon E. T. Davies in 1943. Close to the church is the ancient St. Tewdric's Well, mentioned by the historian Nennius in the 8th or 9th century.Spirit Of The Community (from Monmouthshire County Life) The church is a Grade I listed building as of 19 August 1955.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2040-church-of-st-tewdric- mathern =Mathern Palace= The Mathern estate was traditionally given to the Bishops of Llandaff by King Meurig. It is known that, by 1333, Mathern was one of three medieval palaces belonging to Llandaff (the others being at Bishton and at Llandaff itself); and, after Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion in the early 15th century, it was the only one kept habitable. Part of the existing building is dated to 1419. In his 1882 publication, local historian Octavius Morgan provides a description of three carved stones, showing symbols of the Holy Trinity, which once formed part of a grand gateway to the palace, but by then deposited by Lord Tredegar at the museum at Caerleon, dating from the time of Bishop John de la Zouch who held the See between 1408 and 1423.Morgan, Octavius (1882), \\"Goldcliff and the Ancient Roman Inscribed Stone Found There 1878\\", Monmouthshire & Caerleon Antiquarian Association Most of the remaining buildings, however, date from the 16th century. The property fell out of use around 1700, became a farm, and was partly demolished around 1770. In 1894 the buildings were sold to architect and garden designer Henry Avray Tipping (1855‚Äì1933), who restored some of the buildings and developed a new garden in the Arts and Crafts style. The remains of the palace are a Grade I listed building as of 10 June 1953.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2007-mathern-palace-mathern As of 2013, the Palace is for sale with an estimated value of ¬£2.75M. =Moynes Court= Moynes Court is a Grade II* listed building. An earlier building was rebuilt as a private residence by Francis Godwin, Bishop of Llandaff, in about 1609/10, and much of the building remains from that period. Its grounds contain earthworks thought to be the foundations of an earlier moated manor house. =Wyelands= Wyelands is a large neoclassical villa, about north of the village. It was designed by Robert Lugar and was completed around 1830. It is also a Grade II* listed building. The Vaughan-Hughes family, who occupied the house between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, built cottages and almshouses in Mathern for their employees, some dated to 1891. Sport and leisure Mathern FC currently has three football sides playing in Gwent County League Division 2 and East Gwent Senior League Division 1 and Division 2. In 2005/06 the club - then known as Mathern Wanderers - won the Harry Fishwick Cup defeating Monmouth Town F.C.. At the start of the 2012/13 season Mathern Wanderers FC and members of Tintern Abbey FC amalgamated to become Mathern FC. This was a successful season for the new club, with the 1st team winning the East Gwent Division 1 title and the 2nd team winning the Fishwick Cup. Following ground improvements made during the close season, Mathern were promoted to the Gwent County League's Division Three. Mathern's first team won a further promotion - to Division 2 of the Gwent County League after finishing runners-up to Sebastopol FC at the end of the 2013/14 season. In the 2015/16 season, the club made the final of three cup competitions, winning two and losing one. The Wales Coast Path passes through the village.

It comprises autonomous community (Umuako, Umumba, Umuezu and Umuerim). History It was originally made up of 5 kindred groups which gave it its other name \\"Nsirimo Ama-ise\\". Those 5 kindred groups are: Umuako, Umumba, Umuezu, Umuaha and Umuerim. However, these groups have grown large over time and have been integrated to form three larger communities, each with a traditional ruler (Eze) the paramount ruler. The three communities are: * Nsirimo Autonomous Community (Umuako and Umuaha) whose traditional ruler is Eze Moses I.Akpaka (Imo I of Nsirimo). * Umumba Autonomous Community, Nsirimo (Umumba), whose traditional ruler is Eze Godwill O.Ogbonna (Mba I of Umumba). * Ezu-na-Erim Autonomous Community,Nsirimo (Umuezu and Umuerim), whose traditional ruler was Eze (late) Sir J.A.I.E.Okwuonu (Erizuo I of Ezunaerim). Who was later scheduled to be succeeded by Eze (late) Prof. Victor Chikezie Uchendu but was unable to take place due to his untimely death. Geography Nsirimo is bounded by the Imo River (which is where its name is actually derived), Mbaise beyond the Imo River, Obioma-Ngwa and other suburbs of Umuahia South LGA like Umuwanwa Autonomous Communities; Amuzu, and Abam, its two sister Autonomous Communities all in Ubakala Clan. Economy Nsirimo has no big market except the orie-ama which is a daily market. There are smaller markets in Mbaraekpe (evening) and one in Umuerim. The other markets the people attend are in neighboring towns: Ahia-orie Ntigha, Orieukwu Amorji, among others. Some of the people are traders of assorted articles; butchers who trade on cows and goats; palm produce buyers. There are farmers, mainly subsistence level, in a variety of crops but cassava based, yams, cocoyams and three-leaved yams. Some fish are caught from the Imo River and streams. The economy receives a boost from palm by-products: oil, kernels, mats and rafia- palm which give local palm wine which the people enjoy. Festivals In Nsirimo there is usually a yearly celebration of the New Yam festival around August/September and the Ikoro Dance which takes place from mid-December to early January. The Ikoro Dance involves masquerades displays from various Communities in Nsirimo, it is fast losing its popularity as the influence of Christianity is getting stronger.

The band's name came from an album by artist PJ Harvey, titled Uh Huh Her. The band has mentioned several times changing their name to UHH (pronunciation \\"U-H-H\\"), as opposed to the full \\"Uh Huh Her,\\" believing the original name looks good in written form, but is awkward to pronounce. It is unclear at this time if the name change will be made official at any point. Background Camila Grey (lead vocals, guitar, keyboard), former member of the lo-fi rock band Mellowdrone, had not released any solo material prior to joining Uh Huh Her; however, she had played bass and keyboards for a variety of artists, such as Dr. Dre, Melissa Auf der Maur, Busta Rhymes, and Kelly Osbourne. She was also a member of Adam Lambert's live band (keyboardist). Leisha Hailey (backing vocals, bass, keyboard), formerly of The Murmurs and Gush, had temporarily left the music business to join the cast of Showtime's series The L Word as the character Alice Pieszecki, with the band forming during filming of the final seasons of the show. Originally, drummer Alicia Warrington had been 's third member; however, she separated from the group early on. While several other musicians have performed with Uh Huh Her as hired session players, some being involved with the band on a semi-permanent basis, Uh Huh Her is generally still regarded as a duo, with the only official members being Camila Grey and Leisha Hailey despite both being opened to evolving. Biography = 2006 - 2009, I See Red and Common Reaction = The band formed in 2006, when Camilia Grey and Leisha Haley met at a paint ball game. The band recorded their first project I See Red EP, released on July 24, 2007, in Camila Grey's house. I See Red includes a version of the song \\"Say So\\", the first song the band wrote together, in which Hailey sang lead vocals (the later release of the song had Grey singing lead). I See Red was initially released digitally with limited amounts of hard copies, with a bonus track available on hard copies and on iTunes. 's debut album Common Reaction was released on August 19, 2008, after a delay. Both \\"Explode\\" and \\"Say So\\" were released for a second time on the full-length album as both members felt the songs deserved to be more polished. Common Reaction, which was recorded in Westside Pacific Studio, charted at number 9 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers. Uh Huh Her was dropped from Nettwerk in 2009, with Camilia Grey stating that they still owe them money. =2010 - 2012, label change, new music, and touring= Since making the switch to an independent label, a lack of funding (and Grey's tour with Adam Lambert) put a halt on the immediate release of the second full-length album. To fill the gap between albums, the band released their second EP, Black and Blue on April 19, 2011. The release fell just prior to the band's second major tour, so that they would have new material for fans to purchase. They also headlined at the SXSW Music Festival. The entire six- track EP was recorded and produced in under two weeks. Nocturnes, 's second studio album, was eventually released on October 11, 2011. Grey wrote \\"Human Nature\\", \\"Wake To Sleep\\" and \\"Darkness Is\\" independently (\\"Darkness Is\\" was originally titled \\"Never Absolute\\") while Hailey wrote \\"Debris\\" on her own, and she has said on several occasions that the song is about phone sex. \\"Wake To Sleep\\" was written about the process of making the album, and refers to the differing sleeping habits of the band members. \\"Criminal\\" was written about the band's experience splitting with their former record label and managers. Uh Huh Her made their first TV appearance when they appeared on Jimmy Kimmel. The third EP was released on December 11, 2012, and as a cdr exclusively sold through Amazon, and features reworked, acoustic versions of \\"Debris\\", \\"I See Red\\", \\"Black and Blue\\", \\"Not a Love Song\\", \\"Common Reaction\\", and \\"Philosophy,\\" with Camila Grey stating \\".....The EP is different because it was recorded with the intention of being acoustic. We essentially took old songs and revamped them and recorded some live, some with a full band, and some with just a piano and vocal. Its unique because we‚Äôre known for being really electro, and in this case it's the opposite, very organic and pared down.\\" In this version of \\"Debris\\", Grey sings lead vocals (as opposed to Hailey, who wrote the song). = 2013 - 2015, Future Souls = In 2013, Camilia and Leisha moved their record studio into their home, with Leisha saying \\"We didn't have to rush ourselves with any sort of deadlines. Everything was created within these four walls.\\" On January 20, 2014, the band started accepting pre-orders for a new album called Future Souls available on March 25, 2014, with the cover being designed by Zavier Schipani. The lead single, titled \\"Innocence\\", was made available on iTunes on February 4, 2014. The second single, \\"It's Chemical\\", was made available on March 4, 2014.Future Souls was released on iTunes and other digital providers on March 25, 2014. The band will be touring in support of the album from April 27 through the end of June, across the US and Canada. =2016 - present= In 2016, Camilia Grey and Leisha Hailey decided to take a break from Uh Huh Her, stating \\".....We decided after our ‚ÄúFuture Souls‚Äù tour to take time off to pursue other endeavors.

He was a with the St. George Dragons in the first half of their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He was also a representative in the Australian national team in 1959 and 1960, making two test appearances. Early years Bugden grew up in northern New South Wales and attended Murwillimbah High School where he played rugby union. He moved to Sydney aged 15 as a cadet with the Commonwealth Bank and was posted to Wollongong where he played under-18 rugby league for Nowra-Shellharbour. Back in Sydney a year later he played with the Sutherland Woronora junior league side and a St George fourth grade rugby union side. He was a champion beach sprinter with the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, winning three national beach flags titles. St George Dragons career He played with the St George Dragons' Presidents Cup side in 1954 aged 18 and late that season appeared in reserve grade. He made his first grade debut still aged 18 in the Dragon's premiership semi-final victory over North Sydney in 1954 and two weeks later appeared and scored a try in the final against Newtown which St George lost 27-3. His first full year in first grade was in 1955, learning the ropes against the powerful South Sydney Rabbitohs champion outfit to whom his side again bowed out in the premiership final with Bugden again scoring a try.Whittacker/Hudosn: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 He was the Dragons' first choice half-back for the first six of their consecutive premiership victories from 1956‚Äì61 and played 135 club games (133 1st grade), scoring 56 tries for the club. After St George signed George Evans in 1961 as a potential halfback, Bugden sought an open transfer and was allowed to leave at the end of the season. He followed his Dragons' coach and captain Ken Kearney to Parramatta where he played a further four seasons, often as vice- captain. Representative career Budgen made his state representative debut in 1960 and again represented for New South Wales from the Parramatta club in 1964. In Bugden's representative career he was vying against the incumbent national half-back, Queenslander Barry Muir, who was generally preferred by selectors. At the latter end of Bugden's career Arthur Summons was the test half. Budgen was picked for the 1959 Kangaroo tour and played in five tour matches but no tests. He was selected in the 1960 World Cup squad and although he did not play in any tournament matches, made two tour match appearances for Australia after the World Cup. Bugden made his Test debut in the 1960 domestic series against France for the 2nd Test in Brisbane. He scored three tries on debut in Australia's 56-10 routing of France and backed up for the 3rd Test where he again crossed for a try. Post playing Post football, Budgen worked in the club and hotel industry before finding business success in real estate sales.

He was a Manipuri (a language in the 8th schedule of the Indian constitution) singer. He was perhaps the most prolific modern Meitei singer before his death on 18 October 2006 in Imphal, Manipur, India. Career Nongmaithem Pahari's greatest contribution to the culture of Manipur is the way he introduced a new era of music. He was important in consolidating the popularity of modern Meitei music. Pahari was born on 28 August 1934 in Imphal, Manipur. His father, Nongmaithem Thanil, represented the nobility of that time and was an avid theatre activist. Pahari's affinity towards music was manifested early in his childhood when he was heavily influenced by the likes of KL Saigal, Pankaj Mallik and Mana Dey. Of the many albums that Pahari released during his lifetime, Undying Melodies is considered to be the magnum opus. This is the album that features quite an eclectic number of his all time hits like \\"Ningsingli meraagi thabaldo\\", \\"Eigee eshei saklaroi\\", \\"Ahingda khongbee taamna\\", \\"Nangee maithong urubada\\" and \\"Nangi Napalgi\\". The majority of Pahari's songs were written by Manipur B. Jayantakumar Sharma, who composed music for many feature films and many theatre dramas. He had been decorated with almost all the Awards and recognition in the state pertaining to music and culture. Pahari wrote a book titled Eigi Diaridagi meaning \\"From My Dairy\\". It was mainly about his experiences inside the Imphal and Tripura Jail with brief but important mention of the real genesis of the political and armed revolution in Manipur. He was one of the founding members of United National Liberation Front, a revolutionary front formed in Manipur on 24 October 1964 which is still one of the largest insurgent groups in Manipur. Pahari retired as the Station Director of Doordarshan Kendra Imphal(Television broadcasting station of Manipur) before which he served as the Station Director of All India Radio in various places including Imphal, Kohima and Gangtok. He was the President of Manipur Dramatic Union, Imphal and All Manipur Matam Ishei Kanglup. He also headed many other societies and cultural groups of the state.

After Sudan gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1956, Southern Sudan was not left as an independent state. This led to a deadly war a year before the independence. A party in the war was Anyanya 1 Under Joseph Lagu. Abel Alier was a politician who managed to complete his college education among many Southern Sudanese. He is an internationally respected judge, human-rights lawyer and activist on behalf of Christians in the Sudan. Former Vice President of Sudan (1971‚Äì1982), he served as the first president of the High Executive Council of Southern Sudan. He sits on the Permanent Court of International Arbitration in The Hague and is recognized as Sudan's most prominent Christian lawyer. His latest book is Southern Sudan: Too Many Agreements Dishonoured.  Early years, 1933‚Äì1972  Alier was born in June 1933 in the Bor District of the Upper Nile State in the then Anglo- Egyptian Sudan (the region where he was born is now part of South Sudan). He attended the renowned Rumbek Secondary School, which educated many South Sudanese leaders. He also attended the Wad Saina School in northern Sudan. He graduated from Law School of University of Khartoum and has his own law firm prior to his appointment as magistrate, becoming the first Sudanese judge of southern origin. He was active in the Southern Front since its foundation in 1964 and was in of its representatives at the Round Table Conference in 1965. He was elected to the National Parliament from 1968 to 1969 for Bor South constituency. He subsequently held several ministerial positions in the Sudanese government.  Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972  In 1972 a peace agreement was signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Abel Alier became instrumental in that agreement which permitted Southern Sudan to have its own autonomous government in Juba. Abel Alier became a Vice President of Sudan when Numeiri was the president. Mr. Abel Alier is from the southern part of Dinka Bor. He is older than the late charismatic leader Dr. John Garang. Abel Alier never joined the Southern rebellion, but he has often been instrumental in helping negotiate a peaceful settlement between The North and Southern Sudan. In 2005 he headed the committee that was appointed to investigate the death of Dr. Garang when he left Uganda for Sudan. Dr. John Garang died in a plane crash and Mr. Abiel Alier with the team did their part to investigate the possible mechanical failure that led to the crash which was regionally blamed on a bad weather and lack of clear visibility although the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni hinted that the possibility of a foul play was something that shouldn't be dismissed or disregarded.  Sudan peace deals  In early 1990s, Abel Alier wrote a book under the title Southern Sudan: Too Many Agreements Dishonored. The agreement signed in Ethiopia in 1972 was dishonored by Numeiri in 1983 when he announced the introduction of the Islamic Law. In early 1997 Dr. Riek Machar, signed an agreement with Khartoum. It is referred to as \\"The Khartoum Agreement\\". It was never implemented. Mr. Alier's book was about such agreements and the failure to implement them. The recent peace deal between The South and North of Sudan is known as \\"The Comprehensive Peace Agreement\\" (CPA). This is the agreement that was signed by the late leader and Vice- President Dr. John Garang before his death on the July 30, 2005. The international community including the United States, Great Britain, EU countries and The United Nations along with the African IGAD have supported this agreement and it is likely to succeed after the six years of interim government known today as the government of The National Unity.

History Formed over a period of two years, a group of private funders supporting brain cancer research attended a series of workshops with researchers and clinicians, and asked each other to identify new forms of research, and structures within the research community that were needed to produce effective therapies for brain tumors. The result was the outline of a new funding initiative, to attempt to provide new approaches to cancer research. Collaboration among investigators, cooperation between basic science and clinical application, and merging of disciplines and institutions that operate independently, are the foundation of the approach. Each participating member of BTFC also maintains its own grant- making program and, in some cases, patient information and advocacy programs. These are accessible through their individual websites.

Its immediate predecessor, the Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway, was formed on July 20, 1869, from the merger of the Indianapolis, Crawfordsville and Danville Railroad with the Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad. Both of these predecessor companies had been chartered in 1866, but construction of the railroads had not yet been completed at the time of the merger. After this combination, the railroad was completed and opened on October 1, 1869, connecting Pekin, Illinois, with Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1879, there was a foreclosure and reorganization of the company, after which it was known as the Indiana, Bloomington and Western Railway. In 1881, it merged with the Ohio, Indiana and Pacific Railway (OI&P;), which operated on partially completed tracks between Springfield, Ohio, and Indianapolis. The resulting company retained the Indiana, Bloomington and Western name. The OI&P; rail line from Indianapolis east to Springfield (Ohio) was completed by the IB&W; and opened in 1883. The financial difficulties of the company continued, however, and in 1887 there was another foreclosure and sale of the company's assets. This resulted in a reorganization, after which the company was known as the Ohio, Indiana and Western Railway. The reorganization was unsuccessful, however, and another foreclosure ensued in 1889. After that reorganization, the line from Indianapolis westward was sold to the Peoria and Eastern Railway, while the newer track east of Indianapolis was purchased by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four).

The teleplay by Maria Nation is based on the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting. Plot On December 7, 1993, Jamaican √©migr√© Colin Ferguson boarded the 5:33pm train to Hicksville at the Long Island Rail Road terminal in midtown-Manhattan and opened fire on the passengers with a 9 mm handgun soon after departure.A Mass Murderer's Journey Toward Madness - Printout - TIME While early scenes of the film depict his efforts to purchase the weapon, the bulk of the movie concentrates on the aftermath, particularly its impact on Mineola housewife Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband Dennis was killed and son Kevin so severely injured doctors initially gave him only a 10% chance of survival. McCarthy's determination to rehabilitate Kevin keeps her close by his side, and initially she resists an invitation to lobby Congress to pass stronger gun control measures. When Ferguson's original attorney, William Kunstler, announces he will use \\"black rage\\" as an innovative defense in his client's mass murder trial, McCarthy becomes enraged and stirred to action. In large part due to her efforts, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban is passed in 1994. The following year, Republicans gain a majority in Congress and attempt to repeal the law. When Congressman Dan Frisa, who represents the district in which McCarthy lives, supports the repeal, she impulsively decides to run against him in the next election. She changes her party affiliation to Democratic and, with no previous political experience and against all odds, she garners enough support from the local and national Democratic parties and the endorsement of the local daily newspaper Newsday to defeat Frisa by nearly 17%. Joseph Sargent directed a cast that included Laurie Metcalf as Carolyn McCarthy, Mackenzie Astin as her son Kevin, Sandy Crawley as Dan Frisa, and Tyrone Benskin as Colin Ferguson. The movie was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

While the IUCN Red List describes it as extinct, due to habitat loss, it may still survive, as it has frequently been confused with other members of the genus. Taxonomy The species was first described as distinct by Ren-Chang Ching and You-Xing Lin in 1980. The type specimen was collected by Rev. Benjamin Couch Henry in Lianzhou (Lianxian) in 1881, but was initially determined to be Adiantum gravesii. Ching and Lin distinguished A. lianxianense from that species by its more soft and delicate habit, its slender, hairlike stalks, smaller pinnules obovate or obovate-oblong in shape (rather than broadly ovate or obovate-triangular), and a long stalk wide. A 2012 paper purporting to show that A. lianxianense was genetically nested within A. gravesii led the authors to suggest that, due to their genetic and morphological similarity, A. lianxianense should not be treated as a distinct species from A. gravesii. However, this specimen (J.-M. Lu 441, from Guangdong) was subsequently re- identified as A. mariesii. Distribution and habitat Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest. Conservation The IUCN Red List assessment for A. lianxianense in 2004 declared it to be known only from Guangdong and extinct due to habitat loss. However, the species was reported to have been found in Guanxi in 2011, while a 2012 review of narrowly distributed pteridophyte flora in Asia described its range as extending through Guangdong, Guizhou, and Hunan, and did not describe it as extinct.

About the company Ratbag was founded in 1993 in Adelaide, South Australia by Richard Harrison and Greg Siegele. Known initially as Emergent Games, the company took 3 years to prototype their first title Powerslide. Following its acquisition by Midway Games on 4 August 2005, the company was known as Midway Studios - Australia. On 13 December 2005, employees at the studio were told that Ratbag was going to be closed by its parent company. Two days later on the 15th, the studio was closed, leaving the staff employed there without a job. Subsequently, Krome Studios rehired many of the Ratbag staff and established Krome Studios Adelaide. About the games Ratbag made a name for itself with its debut title Powerslide. The arcade racer, set in a post-apocalyptic future, is powered by a highly advanced rendering system for its time, allowing for up to 300,000 polygons on-screen at once. Powerslide was met with critical if not commercial success, receiving a lot of publicity from the Australian gaming media. Several PC racing titles followed over the years, and before too long Ratbag found itself \\"typecast\\" as a simulation racing developer. With the arrival of the PlayStation 2 in late 2000, Ratbag saw an opportunity to move into the lucrative console market. World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 was the first of several PlayStation 2 titles developed and released, with a handful of titles going unpublished, most notably the follow-up to Powerslide, Powerslide: Slipstream. The last title developed by Ratbag (prior to their acquisition) was The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee for the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. The \\"Adventure/Racing\\" title was the first Ratbag title to break from the simulation tradition set forth by previous titles and features simple \\"on-foot\\" gameplay in addition to various story-driven racing missions. Coming after a wave of similar mission-based driving games and with a rushed development, The Dukes of Hazzard: Return of the General Lee received a lukewarm response from the gaming press.

The attack killed at least 15 people and injured as many as 54 others. Background As tensions increased between the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan Army, small clashes took place near Allaipiddy. It is believed that the LTTE was planning to overrun Jaffna. Hundreds of civilians took shelter in St. Philip Neri Church because of the fighting and to avoid shelling. Incident In the morning of August 12, 2006, LTTE cadres landed near Allaipiddy, prompting government forces to withdraw to the nearby Navy base. The Sri Lankan Army then commenced shelling LTTE positions, continuing through the night. According to a local human rights organization, the University Teachers for Human Rights (UTHR), security forces did not know the strength of LTTE forces in the area and \\"let loose their shells and MBRLs not caring an iota for the civilians\\". On August 13, 2006, at 04:30, an artillery shell fell on the church, killing at least 15 people and injuring up to 54. The wounded were taken to Jaffna for treatment by a priest, Father Thiruchelvam Nihal Jim Brown, who subsequently relocated 300 families from Allaipiddy to St. Mary's Church in Kayts. He disappeared on August 20, a week after the shelling. Responsibility The Army denied responsibility for the shelling of the church and suggested that the LTTE was to blame. However, according to the former parish priest of Allaipiddy, most people believe that the church was hit by fire from government forces. The UTHR reported that survivors claimed that the shelling came from a military base in Palaly. A pro-LTTE website repeated this claim.

Lee and starring Ann Harding, Basil Rathbone and Binnie Hale. It is based on the 1936 play of the same name by Frank Vosper. In turn, the play was based on the 1924 short story Philomel Cottage, written by Agatha Christie. The film was remade in 1947 under the same title. The film was produced by the independent Trafalgar Films at Denham Studios near London.Wood p.91 It is also known by the alternative title A Night of Terror in the United States.

A. Lejeune in The Observer of 10 January 1937 when she said that it \\"was a bit slow in getting started, but once the extra characters of the early scenes are dropped and the film gets the two leading players alone in their Kentish farmhouse, it becomes a hair-raiser of the first order.\\" He concluded that, \\"Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone‚Ä¶overplay a little in the final conflict, but I'm not at all sure that it isn't what is wanted for the picture. The whole treatment of the climax is strained, overwrought, and hysterical; on the border-line between laughter and madness. There is one shot, when the wife throws open the last door to escape and finds her husband standing dead-still on the threshold, that hasn't been equalled for horror since Cagney's body fell through the doorway in Public Enemy. A woman in front of me let out a scream like a steamship siren at this point in the first performance. That scream was the natural voice of criticism testifying to the film's success.\\"The Observer 10 January 1937 (Page 14) The Scotsman of 22 June 1937 started off its review by saying, \\"Suspense is cleverly created and sustained in this film version of the late Frank Vosper's play.\\" The reviewer continued, \\"The suspicion that she has married a murderer is cunningly built up; his homicidal mania, strangely mixed up with greed and sadism, is made plausible and eerily convincing; and the closing sequence, in which the wife, sensing his murderous intention, seeks frantically, almost despairingly, for some escape, achieves dramatic suspense of an intensity only occasionally encountered on the screen. Much of the effect is due to the acting. Ann Harding brings a strong, yet restrained emotion to her part, even when it trembles of the verge of melodramatic insanity, and Basil Rathbone terrifyingly combines sensitiveness and insanity in a polished and persuasive performance.\\"The Scotsman 22 June 1937 (Page 17) References Bibliography *Low, Rachael.

History In 1872, Panmure Public School, a co- educational school, was founded by the German immigrant, Heinrich Muller. The boys' section became Selborne College in 1907, whereas the girls' section moved to Park Avenue in 1886 before becoming a separate school for girls from grades 1 to 10 in 1903. It was originally between Muir Street and Oxford Street, on the site currently occupied by Grens Primary but having then just been vacated by an Uitlander Refugee camp. In 1905, a new uniform was introduced, consisting of a navy gym with green and white colours on the blazers and hats. A school hostel was also established that year. In 1937, the upper grades were moved to new premises on the corner of Connaught Avenue and Oxford Street, and the lower grades remained as a separate school.

Listed at , , he batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Springfield, Missouri. Baseball career Carnett was noticed by big league scouts when he was pitching in high school. He was signed by the Chicago Cubs in 1935, assigned to the Class C Ponca City Angels of the Western Association in his hometown, Ponca City, Oklahoma, and won 19 games. In 1936, he was in spring training with the Los Angeles Angels, the Cubs' top farm club in the Pacific Coast League, but an accident during a \\"pepper\\" game led to a serious shoulder injury that jeopardized his career. He was reassigned back to Ponca City, pitched with the injury and lost ten straight games, took off some time to work on his hitting, and then won 16 consecutive games. Carnett, nicknamed \\"Lefty\\", entered the major leagues in 1941 with the Boston Braves, playing in two games before joining the United States Navy during World War II (1942‚Äì43). After he was discharged, he played for the Chicago White Sox in 1944 and the Cleveland Indians in 1945, mostly as an outfielder and first baseman. In his three-season career, Carnett pitched 5 innings in six appearances, and posted a 3.40 earned run average with four strikeouts, three walks, and no decisions. His career batting statistics included a .268 batting average with 25 doubles, 8 triples, 1 home run, and 67 runs batted in. After World War II ended, he played for the AAA PCL Seattle Rainiers in 1946 before returning to Class C balls and eventually returned to Ponca City to play for the Jets in 1954 and 1955 prior to their moving to Gainesville, Texas. Death Carnett died in November 2016 in Ringling, Oklahoma, two weeks after celebrating his 100th birthday. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Major League Baseball player; that distinction then passed to Bobby Doerr, who was born on April 7, 1918.

CCA's mission is to establish and grow co-operatives, credit unions, and community-based organizations to reduce poverty, build sustainable livelihoods, and improve civil society in less developed countries. To achieve this mission, CCA works closely with Canadian co-operatives and credit unions to channel their knowledge and expertise to partner organizations and co- operatives in Africa, Asia and the Americas. CCA presently operates in 18 countries with an annual budget of approximately $13 million. Climate resilience and gender are cross-cutting priorities in all of CCA's programs. CCA is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. History CCA was created in 1987 by the merger of the Co-operative Union of Canada (CUC) and the Co-operative College of Canada. From 1973 to 1987, the Co-operative College of Canada was a national centre for co-operative education and research. It was established to provide co-op business training and to teach co-op principles. The college itself was short-lived, its formative years date from the late 1930s and early 1940s, when there was a strong push and a practical need for an educational link to the co-operative movement. The Co-operative Union of Canada was formed in 1909 to encourage sharing of information, mutual self-help and concerted actions among co-operative organizations. It began its international development program in 1945 as a part of reconstructive efforts after the Second World War. In 1979 the National Association of Canadian Credit Unions, predecessor to the Credit Union Central of Canada, decided to merge its international credit union development program with CUC's. April 1, 2014 Co- operatives and Mutuals Canada (CMC) was launched as a new national, bilingual association and allowed the Canadian Co-operative Association to focus its efforts entirely on international co-operative development. Among those who have led CCA and the CUC since its inception in 1909 are A.B. MacDonald, a prominent leader in the Antigonish Movement, Alexander Laidlaw and Dr. Ian MacPherson.

It took place on 11 April 1902 and resulted in a victory by a British force commanded by Colonel Robert Kekewich over a Boer commando led by Generals Ferdinandus Jacobus Potgieter and Jan Kemp. The action consisted of a Boer attack on horseback on an entrenched British hillside position in the valley of Rooiwal, near Klerksdorp in the Western Transvaal. The Boers were attempting to break out of a British encircling manoeuvre. Their attack was repulsed at some cost to the Boers in killed and injured. This was the end of the war in the Western Transvaal and also the last major battle of the Anglo-Boer War. Background - the war in the Western Transvaal By 1902, there were roughly 3,000 Boer guerrillas operating in Western Transvaal. There were three separate Boer commandos under the overall command of De La Rey. By this time, many Boer fighters had surrendered and some were now working for the British as scouts. Those who remained in the field were referred to as, 'bitter-einders'. Their situation was very difficult as the British had stripped the veld of food and supplies and had systematically burned Boer farms and homes to deny the guerrillas shelter. Nevertheless, De La Rey's men were able to supply themselves with weapons, food and clothing which they had captured from the British. They also remained a dangerous enemy and on a number of occasions they had scored victories against British troops. On 24 February 1902, for example, they had mauled a British column at Yser Spruit and on 7 March had captured a British general (Lord Methuen) and six field guns at Tweebosch, after routing his command. One reason for the continued Boers successes was the poor quality of some of the British troops in the theatre. Herbert Kitchener had over 16,000 troops operating in the Western Transvaal, but many of them were not regulars, but poorly trained Imperial Yeomanry. Kitchener's strategy for bringing the war to an end was to build fortified blockhouses across the veld and to mount 'drives' or sweeps of the countryside with mobile columns. The first such sweep in the spring of 1902 lasted from 23 March to 30 March, but produced few results in terms of destroying the Boer commandos. Indeed, the British troops suffered a reverse at Boschbult, taking 178 casualties. Hamilton's drive On 6 April, Kitchener put Colonel Ian Hamilton in command of another drive to try to trap De La Rey's fighters. The plan was to 'squeeze' the Boers against the British mobile columns and a line of blockhouses and entrenchments at Klerksdorp. Colonel Robert Kekewich, who was in command of one of Kitchener's columns, dug in at Rooiwal to strengthen his left flank. Having mistakenly gotten tangled up with another British column under Colonel Henry Rawlinson, Kekewich was ordered by Hamilton to proceed to Rooiwal, where he arrived on 10 April. This change of plan proved to be a fortunate one for the British, because the Boers had scouted the Rooiwal position earlier and found it weakly defended. Dug in on the hillside at Rooiwal were about 3,000 mounted infantry, supported by 6 field guns and 2 pom poms. The battle Commandant Potgieter sprawled in the grass 27 metres from the British line, after the battle of Rooiwal on 11 April 1902. He and 50 of his men died charging the British line on horseback. The Boers, however, did not know of the British deployment and they still believed that Rooiwal was only lightly held. One of their commandos, under Commandant Potgieter and General Kemp, therefore tried to overrun the British position early on the morning of 11 April, in an effort to escape Hamilton's 'drive'. Potgieter had around 1,700 men, all mounted riflemen. At around 7:15 am on 11 April, they charged the British position on horseback, firing from the saddle. A British picket of 40 mounted infantry was overrun, taking 20 casualties. Kekewich's position was a strong one, but the sight of the charging Boers panicked some of the inexperienced British troops and a number of Yeoman units fled the scene of the battle and were not stopped until they were a mile away from the fighting. A Lieutenant Carlos Hickie managed to stop the stampede with a mixture of pleas and threats. In addition, a number of the regular British officers on the scene were very critical of the 'wild' shooting of their men. In spite of this, however, the Boer charge was stopped about 30 metres from the British line by artillery and rifle fire. Fifty Boers were killed outright and more were wounded. Among the dead was Potgieter, wearing a distinctive blue shirt. Kekewich later commented that, 'one good company of infantry could have killed 300 Boers'. The surviving Boers made good their retreat. Boer fire, delivered from the saddle, had produced about 50 casualties in the British line. Ian Hamilton and Rawlinson arrived on the scene just as the fighting was ending. However, Hamilton delayed the pursuit of the beaten Boers as he feared that the retreat was a ruse and that his men would fall into Boer ambushes. At about 9:45, or 90 minutes after the Boer charge had been repulsed, Hamilton sent his mounted troops in pursuit of the enemy. They captured a further 50 Boers and re-captured the artillery lost at Tweebosch. Kitchener had issued orders that Boers captured wearing British uniforms were to be shot. However, although a number of wounded Boers were indeed wearing captured British khaki, Hamilton ordered that they be spared. Aftermath The battle was a setback for the Boers, but their casualties were relatively light and most of their fighters escaped the action unscathed. In any case, peace talks to end the war were already imminent. They began on 19 May in Pretoria. De La Rey, the Boers' commander in the Western Transvaal was one of the Boer negotiators.

He works as director of the Manuscript Center and Museum affiliated to the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. He is a university professor, a public lecturer, a columnist and a prolific author of more than 50 books. The study of Arabic and Islamic manuscripts has been his primary interest, and cataloguing, editing and publishing these manuscripts constitute the bulk of his work. He has worked as a consultant in the field of Arabic heritage preservation and conservation in a number of international institutions, including UNESCO, ESCWA and the Arab League, and has directed a number of projects aimed at the delimitation and preservation of Arabic manuscript heritage. Biography Ziedan was born in Sohag, Egypt in 1958. He moved with his grandfather to Alexandria when he was still a child and was raised and taught in this Mediterranean metropolis. He joined the philosophy department at the University of Alexandria and graduated summa cum laude. His postgraduate studies focused on Sufism and its philosophical underpinnings. He obtained his PhD degree in 1989 for his dissertation on The Qadiri Sufi Order, with a study and edition of the poetical works of Abdul Qadir al-Jilani or Abdul-Qadir Gilani. He lives in Alexandria, and has a son and two daughters. Sufism Ziedan's work on Sufism underscores not just the mystic introspective lineaments of Islamic Sufism, but more importantly its philosophical underpinnings. He has placed consistent emphasis on the study of Ibn Arabi and Abdul Karim al-Jili, regarded as two of the most important figures of philosophical Sufism in the history of Islam. His work on Abdul Karim al-Jili is seen by many as the most authoritative work in the field. Islamic philosophy The most distinctive feature in Ziedan's study of Islamic philosophy is his attempt to uncover the origins of a strand of Islamic philosophical thought that, in his view, had not been influenced by Hellenistic philosophy. He thinks that the parable of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan, for instance, with its many versions and interpretations by such important figures as Avicenna, Ibn Tufayl, al-Suhrawardi and Ibn al-Nafis, is a source of Islamic philosophical thought for understanding Islamic philosophy on its own terms. This view forms the basis of his re-editing of the complete philosophical parable of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan in his Hayy Ibn Yaqzan: the Four Texts and their Authors. Ziedan's work as a public intellectual is reflected in several of his later works including Arabic Theology and Rationals Behind Religious Violence ÿßŸÑŸÑÿßŸáŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä Ÿàÿ£ÿµŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜŸä which examines the dynamics behind the key ideas the shaped Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and their primary links to each other and to the geography of the region. History of Islamic medicine Another dimension to Ziedan's work is his study of the history of Islamic medicine, which draws him into the scientific realms of medicine, mathematics, astronomy, chemistry and related topics. The emphasis here is on the immense scientific heritage left by the Arabs throughout history. His contribution, however, is particularly visible in medicine. He is, as evidenced in his studies, very much preoccupied with the Arabic translations, commentaries and annotations on Hippocrates and Galen. On the other hand, his studies on Ibn al-Nafis and his critical edition of his grand medical encyclopedia (30 volumes) al-Shamil fil Sina‚Äôa al-Tibbiyya catapulted him as an Ibn al-Nafis scholar. Arabic manuscript preservation Ziedan sees cataloguing as an ars maior, that has not received the attention it deserves. According to him, cataloguing is the key to have a panoramic view of a particular manuscript heritage. With this in mind, Ziedan produced some 20 manuscript catalogues using detailed descriptive cataloguing techniques rather than skimpy uninformative bibliographic records. His catalogues are mostly thematic, i.e. they are not general catalogues, they handle each theme of knowledge separately. Fiction Ziedan has also written fiction. His novel Zil al-Af‚Äôa (\\"Shadow of the Serpent\\") treats the notion of the sacred female through a contemporary setting with humdrum personae in the first part; in the second part, letter fragments from a female anthropologist to her daughter, the heroine of the first part, explain how the role of the female has been misshapen, abused and diabolically transformed throughout history. The novel has been criticized for its abnormal structure and superfluous intellectualism. Ziedan's second novel is the historico-theological work Azazeel (ÿπÿ≤ÿßÿ≤ŸäŸÑ), which won the 2009 International Prize for Arabic Fiction (the so-called \\"Arabic Booker\\").Gemma Champ. \\"Egyptian wins Arabic Booker prize\\", The National, Mar 17, 2009 According to the book, it is written as a translation of scrolls that had been discovered in the ruins of a monastery northwest of Aleppo, in Syria. An Egyptian monk called ‚ÄúHypa‚Äù wrote the original manuscript as an autobiography in the Aramaic language in first half of the fifth century AD. This was a time of great internal turmoil in Eastern Christianity. His other novels are The Nabatian (ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ®ÿ∑Ÿä) in 2005, Places (ŸÖÿ≠ÿßŸÑ) in 2013 and its sequel, Guantanamo (ÿ¨ŸàŸÜÿ™ŸÜÿßŸÖŸà) in 2013. His novels were translated to French, Italian and Russian among other languages.

The returning northbound train left Helsinki at 4:00pm, arriving in Oulu at 10:45pm. The Lapponia express train service began in 1974 as a fast and direct connection between Oulu and the nation's capital.

The Lapponia trains ran under that name until 1994 when Finnish State Railways discontinued the use of train-specific naming.

History  = First formation = It was active during the Winter War against Finland as part of the Leningrad Military District, beginning operations at the end of November 1939 under KomKor M.P. Duhanov with the 49th and Special Rifle Corps as well as assigned aviation units.9th Army, Red Army, 30.11.1939 9th Army was initially tasked with the capture of Kajaani and Oulu. Two divisions attached to the army, the 44th and 163rd Rifle Divisions, were defeated by the Finns during the Battle of Suomussalmi. It appears to have been disbanded after the end of the war. = Second formation = In 1940 the Army was created to take part in the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. It was disbanded on 10 July 1940. = Third formation = By 1941 the Army was designated the 9th Separate Army (briefly) and included the 14th, 35th and 48th Rifle Corps (the last under then General Major Rodion Malinovsky), 2nd Cavalry Corps, 2nd and 18th Mechanised Corps, 80th, 81st, 82nd, 84th, 86th Fortified Regions and a number of other units - the biggest army on the Soviet border before the German Operation Barbarossa began. However, it was more an administrative than an operational formation on 22 June 1941.John Erickson (historian), The Road to Stalingrad, 2003 Cassel Military Paperbacks edition, p.141 With General Major M.V. Zakharov as chief of staff, it was tasked to cover the Beltsa, Kishinev, and Odessa approaches as part of General Ivan Tyulenev‚Äôs Southern Front. The first engagement came when Von Schobert‚Äôs Eleventh Army crashed into the juncture of 9th and 18th Armies. North of Jassy, the German assault fell on the 48th Rifle Corps which was covering Beltsa. Tyulenev ordered a counterattack, and soon 48th Rifle and 2nd Cavalry Corps plus 2nd Mechanised Corps from Southern Front reserve were engaged at Beltsa and Stefanesti. Tyulenev then drew off 25th, 51st, and 150th Rifle Divisions from two of Zakharov‚Äôs rifle corps to form a new ‚ÄòCoastal Group‚Äô to cover the eastern bank of the Prut River, the northern bank of the Danube and the Black Sea coast.Erickson, 2003, p.168 (This group later became the Separate Coastal Army). By early August, 9th Army was falling back to Nikolayev under repeated German blows, and by 17 August across the River Ingulets and over to the eastern bank of the Dnieper. The ‚ÄòCoastal Group‚Äô was meanwhile falling back on Odessa. By early 9 October Army was falling back on Taganrog, after a failed attempt by Southern Front's three armies to hold a line between Pavlograd and the Sea of Azov had been shattered by an outflanking maneuver by Von Kleist's newly renamed First Panzer Army.Erickson, 2003, p.255-6, 265 The resulting Battle of the Sea of Azov shattered 9th Army, virtually destroying it. The Soviets‚Äô next move was a planned offensive orchestrated by Timoshenko, GlavKom Southwest. After still more retreats and the loss of Rostov, 9th Army stepped off on 17 November as part of an assault by both Southern and Southwestern Fronts, and by 29 November, 9th Army in conjunction with 56th Army and other units had cleared Rostov and the city was back in Soviet hands. 9th Army then joined Timoshenko's strategic reserve, to join the battle again when the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya Offensive operation began.Erickson, 2003, p.328-9 9th Army joined this assault in January 1942 when it broke into the German front on the northern Donets along with 6th and 57th Armies, reaching the line Balakleya-Lozovaia-Slavyansk before being halted by repeated German counterattacks. Still with Southern Front, 9th Army was then allotted a subsidiary part in the Kharkov offensive ‚Äì the Second Battle of Kharkov ‚Äì which kicked off in May 1942. Along with 57th Army, 9th Army was tasked to secure the southern part of the Izyum bulge in the front. While being in a secondary sector, 9th Army took much of the force of the German response, Operation Fridericus.Erickson, 2003, p.346-7 Eight hours into the German counterstroke, at noon on 17 May, elements of the First Panzer and Seventeenth Armies were ten miles into 9th Army's positions and threatening the neighbouring 57th Army's rear. Commander, Southern Front, General Lieutenant R. Ya. Malinovskii, at once drew 5th Cavalry Corps, a rifle division, and a tank brigade out of reserve in an attempt to halt Von Kleist. However discussions and decisions at Stavka about breaking off the Kharkov offensive in response did not come quickly enough, and 6th and 57th Armies were surrounded in the Izyum pocket with the loss of 200,000 plus men in casualties alone. Later, as part of the North Caucasian and Transcaucasian Fronts, the Army fought on the big bend of the river Don (in the summer of 1942), and participated in the Battle of the Caucasus. In November 1943 the army headquarters was disbanded, and its formations and units transferred to other armies.

She was renamed and commissioned after Melucta, a star in the constellation Gemini. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Construction Thomas A. McGinley was laid down on 21 January 1944, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 2470, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; she was sponsored by Mrs. Thomas A. McGinley, the widow of the namesake, and launched 20 March 1944. She was acquired by the US Navy as Melucta from WSA under bareboat charter 31 March 1944; converted from a freighter by Gibbs Gas Engine Co., Jacksonville; and commissioned 22 July 1944, with Commander John L. Graham, USN, in command. Service history Following shakedown off Norfolk, Virginia, Melucta, was assigned to Naval Transportation Service, 17 August, for cargo carrying duties along the U.S. East Coast into the fall. By 10 November, she was en route to the Marshalls, towing to Pearl Harbor, before continuing on to Ebon Atoll. The cargo ship operated in the South Pacific Ocean for the next year. Melucta steamed to San Francisco, California, in May 1945, for repairs and reloading, departing the first week of June. In mid October she got underway for the U.S. East Coast via the Panama Canal Zone, arriving Norfolk, Virginia, 28 November. Decommissioning Melucta was decommissioned there 13 December, and was delivered to War Shipping Administration 5 days later. Her name reverted back to Thomas A.

WNRS is owned and operated by Stu-Comm, Inc. and simulcasts WNRN full-time. History WUDZ (\\"woods\\") signed on in late 1979 as Sweet Briar College's student radio station, replacing an earlier Part 15 station that had the unofficial callsign of WSBC. The station was originally licensed for just 10 watts ‚Äì good for reception at a five-mile radius from campus ‚Äì but upgraded to 100 watts during 1980. By 1997, WUDZ was broadcasting for the legally required minimum of 36 hours per week: 6 p.m. through midnight on Sunday through Thursday, off on Friday, and noon through 6 p.m. on Saturday. In February 2000, the callsign was changed to WNRS-FM. That April, Sweet Briar entered into a local marketing agreement to rent its extra airtime to Stu-Comm, Inc., who filled the hours not programmed by students with a relay of WNRN. The station moved to a 30-watt transmitter from the 2,900-foot Tobacco Row Mountain west of Sweet Briar in 2002, allowing reception in car radios in Lynchburg. Sweet Briar College sold WNRS-FM outright to Stu-Comm in 2010. By this time, Sweet Briar programming had dwindled to a single three-hour window on Mondays through Thursdays during the school year. WSWE-LP has since launched as a new outlet for student programming. In 2011, Stu-Comm attempted to move WNRS-FM to a 20-kilowatt transmitter on near Appomattox Court House, which would have given the station a 50-mile radius from the Roanoke metropolitan area east to Powhatan County and south to the North Carolina border. A first application was dismissed in 2011 as the Federal Communications Commission primarily determined a signal on 89.9 from this location would cause unacceptable interference to multiple other stations. A second application on 89.5 from the same location progressed to the construction permit stage and received local zoning approval, but was abandoned in July 2015. Stu-Comm has since moved the station off of Tobacco Row Mountain back to the town of Sweet Briar, in order to increase its power from 30 to 1100 watts.

He and Jerry Rees were the main animators for the CGI sequences in Tron. He is currently the head of the Digital Arts department at Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Chapman University. Career Kroyer began his animation career in 1975 by working in a small commercial studio. In 1977, he finally ended up at Disney Studios as animator on The Fox and the Hound but left Disney later because he did not want to work on The Black Cauldron. It was then he met future Tron director Steven Lisberger, who was working on Animalympics. After Animalympics was completed, Lisberger developed Tron and sold it to Disney. After Tron was finished, Kroyer decided to stay with computer animation instead of traditional animation and worked at Robert Abel and Associates and Digital Productions. In 1986, he and his wife, Sue, started Kroyer Films to combine computer animation with hand-drawn animation. They made a short film titled Technological Threat; it was nominated for an Academy Award in 1988 and preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2008. After Technological Threat was finished, Kroyer decided to stay with computer animation films for films such as Jetsons: The Movie and Rugrats in Paris: The Movie. He directed Computer Warriors: The Adventure Begins in 1990 and then FernGully: The Last Rainforest in 1992. He was originally set to direct Quest for Camelot but left the project over creative differences.

He was perhaps best known as the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate from Arizona in 1964 and 1968. After graduating from the University of Arizona he joined the staff of Hayden in 1952 but was soon called into active duty in the air force during the Korean War. Returning to the Senate in 1955, he remained on the staff until Hayden retired. During his first bid, he ran for the seat held by Republican Barry Goldwater, who declined to seek a third term to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. Goldwater lost to incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson. Despite Johnson's landslide victory and big gains for Democrats across the country, Goldwater narrowly carried his home state, and Elson lost the Senate race to Republican Governor Paul Fannin by a 51.4% - 48.6% margin. Elson was nominated again in 1968, now for the seat being vacated by his boss, Carl Hayden, who by then was President pro tempore and dean of the Senate. Elson lost again, this time by a margin of 57.2% to 42.8%. The winner was Goldwater, who returned to the Senate for three more terms.

History From the earliest times, the fertile region around Saij≈ç (part of the ancient province of Aki) has been occupied, as displayed by the Mitsushiro Kofun (a 5th-century burial mound) and the Aki-Kokubunji (Aki-Kokubun temple) from the 8th century. It benefited from its location on the San'y≈çd≈ç linking the capital with Ky≈´sh≈´, but the benefit was double-edged as its communications and proximity to the sea meant it was heavily embroiled in the Sengoku period struggles between the clans of western Honsh≈´. During the later Edo period, Saij≈ç was a post-town on the San'y≈çd≈ç and home to a government office. In 1974 the Kamo District towns of Saij≈ç, Hachihonmatsu, Shiwa and Takaya were combined to form Higashihiroshima, the twelfth city in Hiroshima Prefecture. In April 1973, Saij≈ç was chosen as the home of the (largely) relocated Hiroshima University, with the relocation occurring between 1982 and 1995. The relocation of the university and the establishment of the Hiroshima Central Technopolis (since 1984) has created many jobs and intellectual opportunities, a new communications network (Saij≈ç was made part of the Sanyo Shinkansen in October 1993) and has put the area on the technology map, but has also seen much of the green-field areas eaten up as the population of Higashihiroshima City soared to 100,000 (August 1992). Sake Saij≈ç is famed for sake (rice wine). Within the narrow streets of the Sakagura Dori (\\"Sake Storehouse Road\\") area near JR Saij≈ç Station are the Namako wall (white-lattice walled) and (red-roof tile) roofs of ten well-known sake breweries; Chiyonoharu, Fukubijin, Hakubotan, Kamoki, Kamoizumi, Kamotsuru, Kirei, Saijotsuru, Sakurafubuki, and Sanyotsuru. From July 1995, Saij≈ç was made the home of the Brewery Laboratory of the National Tax Office. Each October there is also the Saij≈ç Sake Matsuri ÈÖí„Åæ„Å§„Çä (Sake Festival) which draws crowds of between 100,000-200,000 revelers and sake connoisseurs before the brewing season (October‚ÄìMarch) begins.https://sakematsuri.com/ References External links * Sake Festival * Hiroshima Cricket Club * (Japanese) * (English) * Park.org Dissolved municipalities of Hiroshima Prefecture ","title":"Saij≈ç, Hiroshima (Kamo)"},{"id":"12853086","text":"Aglaia agglomerata is a species of plant in the family Meliaceae.

History The area includes evidence of settlement dating back to the Bronze Age, with at least seven roundhouses, likely to date from the Iron Age, up to the time of the Roman Empire. Subsequently, the area would have been used as a Roman marching camp, and has associations with the Severan invasion, ca 200 CE.Aberdeenshire Council: Recent Archaeological Work at Deers Den Aberdeenshire Council: Deers Den, Kintore The marching camp would have been large enough for 10,000 troops to rest. Excavations in the area have found 44 bread ovens and 20 separate buildings over the area. The excavation of 44 bread ovens is the largest number of Roman bread ovens found in one location in the UK. They would have been open flat breads topped with vegetables, similar to modern pizzas. The archaeological discoveries of the area came about due to a proposed housing development in about 2003. The roundhouses became scheduled monuments on 30 March 2009, under Historic Environment Scotland. Location and features There are ring ditch houses in the area, dating to the Bronze age, somewhere in the range of 1600 - 700 BCE. The scheduled monument roundhouses are located near the A96 road, to the west of the River Don. They are not directly visible, but instead show through cropmarks visible from the air.

Plot summary The novel takes place over a period of two days in a VA hospital. Walter James, a white veteran of the Vietnam war, has just been admitted. His face was completely reconstructed after he suffered severe wounds. As a result of a fragment of bullet embedded in his brain, James also suffers blackouts and dizziness. He meets Braiden Chaney, a black man who lost both of his arms and legs from gunfire in the Vietnam War. He has been in the VA hospital for 22 years. The novel is structured in a stream of consciousness style, much of it taking place within Braiden's mind. He constructs elaborate fantasies, most of which involve his being a king in Africa, to escape the plight of his physical state. Most of the novel consists of dialogue between the two men. They tell each other their respective stories, mostly during the course of one night, while they drink beer and smoke pot that Braiden's sister has smuggled into the hospital for him. The novel is ultimately a theodicy, as it tries attempts to explain the paradox of evil in a world created by an omnipotent God. Braiden has several conversations with Jesus during the novel. The reader is left to determine whether they are fantasies or real conversations, the novel implies that they are real. The plot of the novel borrows from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is referred to in the novel. Braiden, along with his sister, eventually convince Walter to kill him.

In the Phnom Kulen National Park, Siem Reap Province, it is one of the (12 or more) dominant canopy and emergent tree taxa in the common Evergreen Forest formation. In Zh≈çnggu√≥/China it occurs a tree some 5-9m tall, with a diameter at breast height of 30cm. It has rufous bark, though young branches are glabrous and pale brown. Leaves are 25 to 30cm. The fruit, c.5.5 by 3-3.5cm is brown and elliptic, 1 to 3 seeds. It flowers and fruits from November to January. The tree grows in evergreen broad-leaved forests at 1200-1800m elevation on limestone hills, particularly in Malipo County, Yunnan. The International Union for Conservation of Nature/IUCN has the plant as a rare scattered tree primarily found along rocky coasts in evergreen and primary forest. A. edulis trees have one of the largest diameter sizes (50-70cm) in the Dryland Forest and Swamp Peat Forest formations in the Muara Kendawangan Nature Reserve, Ketapang Regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0 to 30m.a.s.l.).

In Doi Suthep‚ÄìPui National Park, northern Thailand, it is one of the upper canopy trees of the Evergreen Forest formation, growing from 1,350m to 1,500m elevation. The species grows amongst the 16‚Äì22m high middle layer of the three levels of dense vine-tangled canopy occurring in the Dry Evergreen Forest community at the Sakae Rat Environmental Research Station, Pak Thong Chai District, northeastern Thailand. At Hazarikhil Wildlife Sanctuary, Chittagong Division, the tree's presence in Bangladesh was established for the first time since the only previous record made by Joseph Dalton Hooker (Hook.f.) in 1875.

Fearey was best known for establishing two major Seattle civic festivals, the Bumbershoot and the Northwest Folklife Festival. Early life Jack Fearey was born in Portland, Oregon in 1923. He attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, for three years before leaving to serve in the U.S. military during World War II. Following the war, Fearey graduated from the University of Washington in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in music. Fearey began working at radio stations in Bellingham in the late 1940s before moving to Seattle's KING-TV in the early 1950s. He worked in several positions at KING over the next twenty years, including operations manager, producer and the station's program director. Fearey won a Peabody Award for KING's children's television show \\"Wunda Wunda\\" while at the television station. Seattle Center Seattle mayor Wes Uhlman appointed Jack Fearey to become director of the Seattle Center in 1970. Fearey had been serving as the president of the Seattle chapter of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences at the time of his appointment. In 1970, the Seattle Center was a neglected complex that had served as the site of Seattle's 1962 World's Fair. The Center, which stands at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, was not open year round and was little used by the general public during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Jack Fearey is widely credited with transforming the Seattle Center into a civic center and Seattle cultural hub during his twelve years as director from 1970 until 1982. Under Fearey's direction, the site for the Seattle Children's Theatre, located at the corner of Second Avenue and Thomas Street, was acquired. He played a major role in the development of the Bagley Wright Theatre, which opened in 1983 after his departure as director of the Seattle Center, as well as the renovation of the Seattle Playhouse, which is now the Intiman Theatre. The Bumbershoot and the Northwest Folklife Festival each got their start under Jack Fearey's direction. The Bumbershoot, a major Memorial Day arts and music festival, was founded as Festival '71 in 1971 and was renamed to its current name in 1973. The Northwest Folklife Festival, now a major Washington Labor Day event, was also founded during Fearey's tenure as director of the Seattle Center. Additionally, Fearey oversaw the installation of covered walkways in the Seattle Center to shield pedestrians from Seattle's famous rainy weather. He also worked to bring the \\"Treasure of Tutankhamen\\" tour to Seattle, which exhibited for 4 months in 1978 at the center's Flag Plaza Pavilion. Jack Fearey resigned in 1982 after members of the Seattle city council blamed him for financial mismanagement. The Seattle Center was over one million dollars in debt at the time. Post Seattle Center Jack Fearey continued to stay active the television, business and arts industries following his departure from the Seattle Center. He served on the board of directors of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Fearey was also the former president of the International Association of Auditorium Managers. Fearey worked during his later years as a consultant for The Fearey Group, a Seattle based public relations agency owned by his wife, Pat Fearey. Jack Fearey died on July 21, 2007, after battling Alzheimers. He was survived by his wife, Pat, (Fearey's first wife died in 1975.)

Looney Tunes theatrical animated short, directed by Robert McKimson and written by Sid Marcus. The short was released on May 1, 1954, and stars Bugs Bunny. Similar in plot to Homeless Hare, Bugs finds himself squaring off against a construction worker who wants to build over his hole in the ground. Plot Construction is underway for a new freeway. The vibrations wake Bugs and cover him with dirt. Bugs confronts a beefy construction worker (voiced by John T. Smith), and when he realizes that a freeway may be built going through his home, Bugs refuses to move. The construction worker tries to blow up Bugs' burrow, but only succeeds in creating a crater with a large narrow pillar in the center, with Bugs' home still intact (\\"I hear ya knockin', but ya can't come in!\\") Since then, the construction worker continues to try to get Bugs out. 1) First, he climbs to the top of the pillar with various tools and threatens the rabbit, but Bugs emerges from a smaller hole at the bottom of the pillar, and cuts through the worker's ladder. This sends him falling into a pile of wet concrete, which he walks out of, drenched in concrete, before it sets. 2) While Bugs is reading The Raven in a comic book (\\"Poes Kiddie Komics\\" at that), the worker uses a rock-cutting saw to cut through the pillar. However, Bugs diverts the saw downwards into his fuse box, electrocuting the worker. 3) While Bugs plays a nonsense song called \\"There Ain't No Place Like a Hole in the Ground\\" on a banjo, the worker drops a bomb from a helicopter onto his bed. Bugs jumps out of the bomb's way to turn the page of his music book, and the bomb bounces back to the helicopter before detonating, destroying the helicopter and leaving the worker hanging from the still-spinning rotors. 4) The worker attempts to crush the pillar with a 60-ton weight from a construction crane, but Bugs, disguised as another worker, manipulates him into crushing himself into the ground with the weight. 5) The worker climbs to the top of the pillar again, this time with some scaffolding, and attempts to light some dynamite. Bugs lights a match inside the bottom of the scaffolding, and the flame blows all the way to the top, prematurely lighting the dynamite and causing it to detonate before the worker can drop it into the hole. 6) Finally the worker tries to pour a large amount of concrete on top of the hole, but when it dries, he finds out that Bugs has diverted the concrete around his hole with an umbrella, reinforcing the pillar and defiantly placing a door and mailbox on top. A shot of a local newspaper is shown afterwards, with a picture of Bugs on the front page, and a headline that reads \\"CITY REACHES COMPROMISE WITH RABBIT!!\\", followed by a scene that reveals that the freeway is ultimately abruptly diverted around the hole, in literally a half-circle. Bugs pops out of his hole to declare: \\"The sanctity of the American home must be presoived (preserved)!\\".

He is chiefly known as a footballer and was part of Derry's 1993 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship winning side, also won Ulster Senior Football Championships in 1993 and 1998. With Derry footballers he usually played at corner-back and is regarded as one of the best defenders and tightest markers to have played the game. In 2000 McKeever became the first Ulster player to be nominated for All Stars in both football and hurling in the same season. He won the football All Star, but narrowly missed out on the hurling accolade. Had he have won the double All Star, he would have become only the second player ever after Cork legend Ray Cummins to win both awards in the same year. He has won Irish News Ulster All-Star awards and was named right-corner back on the Irish News Team of the Decade in 2004. The public voted him onto the All-Time Derry Football Team via an online poll in 2007. McKeever played club football with St. Canice's GAC Dungiven and club hurling with Kevin Lynchs. Personal life Kieran McKeever was born into a footballing household. His father Thomas was a Derry minor panelist in the mid 1960s and his brothers Emmet and Cathal have both represented Derry and New York at hurling and football. In 2008 Cathal transferred to Tyrone side Carrickmore. His abilities as a dual player were nurtured at St. Patrick‚Äôs Secondary School by former Derry footballers Se√°n O'Connell, Fintan McCloskey and Francie Brolly and Kilkenny born hurling coach Liam Hinphey. He also excelled at athletics at school, particularly the high jump. Football career =Inter-county= He captained quite a few successful underage teams including the Derry minor side that were runners up to Down in the Ulster Championship team in 1986.
