Malay nationalism (Malay: Semangat Kebangsaan Melayu Jawi: ÿ≥ŸÖ⁄†ÿ™ ŸÉÿ®⁄†ÿ≥ÿßÿ°ŸÜ ŸÖŸÑÿßŸäŸà ) refers to the nationalism that focused overwhelmingly on the Malay anticolonial struggle, motivated by the nationalist ideal of creating a Bangsa Melayu (\\"Malay nation\\") with its central objectives were the advancement and protection of what constitutes the Malayness ‚Äì religion (Islam), language (Malay), and royalty (Malay rulers). Such pre-occupation is a direct response to the European colonial presence and the influx of foreign migrant population in Malaya since the mid-nineteenth century. Malay nationalism has its roots in the end of the 19th century, but did not exist as a united and organised political movement. The concept of ketuanan Melayu (Malay hegemony) was largely irrelevant at the time, as the Chinese and Indians, who formed almost half of the population, did not see themselves as citizens of Malaya.Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). The Chinese Dilemma, pp. 26‚Äì27. East West Publishing. . A report by the British Permanent Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies in the early 1930s found that \\"the number of non-Malays who have adopted Malaya as their home is only a very small proportion of the whole population\\".Hwang, In-Won (2003). Personalized Politics: The Malaysian State under Mahathir, p. 24. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. . The rise of Malay nationalism was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions ‚Äì the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites. The Malay leftists were represented by Kesatuan Melayu Muda, formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in Sultan Idris Training College, with an ideal of Greater Indonesia. In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The Islamists were originally represented by Kaum Muda consisted of Middle Eastern‚Äìeducated scholars with Pan-Islamic sentiment. The first Islamic political party was Parti Orang Muslimin Malaya (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by Pan-Malayan Islamic Party in 1951. The third group was the conservatives consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive Malay College Kuala Kangsar. They formed voluntary organisations known as Malay Associations in various parts of the country and their primary goals were to advance the interests of Malays as well as requesting British protection on Malay positions. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to assert Malay dominance over Malaya. The first major show of force by Malay nationalism came in 1946 when British proposed a Malayan Union that would greatly reduce the powers of Malay rulers and give citizenship to foreign immigrants. Under intense pressure from the United Malays National Organisation, the British withdrew the proposal, resulting the formation of Persekutuan Tanah Melayu in 1948. Early 20th century Although Malaya was effectively governed by the British, de jure the Malays were sovereign over Malaya. A former British High Commissioner, Hugh Clifford, urged \\"everyone in this country [to] be mindful of the fact that this is a Malay country, and we British came here at the invitation of Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers, and it is our duty to help the Malays to rule their own country.\\"Keith, Patrick (2005). Ousted!, p. 140. Media Masters. . The British government adopted an open \\"Pro-Malay\\" policy so that, in the words of High Commissioner Sir Laurence Guillemard, the Malays could be equipped \\"to take their proper place in the administrative and commercial life of these States.\\"Roff, W.R. (1974). The Origins of Malay Nationalism, pp. 114, 118. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. No ISBN available. The local-born non-Malay communities soon began agitating against the government's policies, and began demanding political representation. In 1936, the Malayan-born Indian community asked the British High Commissioner, Sir Shenton Thomas, to grant them a share of administrative appointments. Thomas rejected the request, stating, \\"...I do not know of any country in which what I might call a foreigner ... has ever been appointed to an administrative post.\\"Roff, pp. 109‚Äì110. Later, some commentators attributed this to ignorance on the British' part of the increasing size of local-born non-Malays. Although 1.5 million Chinese migrated to Malaya to work as manual labourers ‚Äì with a million Chinese workers in Malaya in turn emigrating back to China ‚Äì between 1911 and 1921, these critics contend that during the same period, the locally born Chinese community grew from 8% to 17% of the Chinese population domiciled in Malaya. The British nevertheless appeared to view the entire Chinese community as ‚Äì according to one academic ‚Äì a \\"transient labour force\\", with one government official insisting it would be dangerous to consider the Chinese as having \\"a tendency to permanent settlement\\" despite such figures. The locally born Indian community ‚Äì comprising 20% of the Indian population, the rest being manual labourers having migrated for similar reasons as the Chinese at around the same time ‚Äì was likewise largely ignored.Roff, pp. 110‚Äì111. However, the British at the same time took the stance that the Malays were to be left alone to their traditional peasant lifestyle as far as possible, involving only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues. Despite the policy of excluding non- Malays from positions of authority, much of the rank and file of the civil service was non-Malays, many of them Indians who the government had specifically brought in for this purpose. A number of historians have described the pro-Malay policies of the British as designed merely to preserve the position of the British, rather than to strengthen that of the Malays; many have characterised the British approach as being one of \\"divide and rule,\\" where \\"the towns were Chinese, with their shopkeepers and traders; the villages were Malay, with their farmers and fishermen; the plantations were Indian, with their rubber tappers and labourers,\\" keeping \\"the races at just the right distance from each other to have the disparate elements of Malaya work in remote harmony\\".Abdullah, Asma & Pedersen, Paul B. (2003). Understanding Multicultural Malaysia, p. 44. Pearson Malaysia. .Rashid, Rehman (1993). A Malaysian Journey, p. 28. Self-published. . In the 1920s, the local- born Chinese community began pushing for a greater role in Malayan government. However, they remained in the minority, with much of the Chinese community ‚Äì which by now made up 39% of the Malayan population ‚Äì still comprising transient labourers. Nevertheless, the dialect speaking Chinese ‚Äì which comprised the bulk of local-born Chinese ‚Äì wanted to be given government positions and recognised as Malayans. One Straits Chinese leader asked, \\"Who said this is a Malay country? ... When Captain [Francis] Light arrived, did he find Malays, or Malay villages? Our forefathers came here and worked hard as coolies ‚Äì weren't ashamed to become coolies ‚Äì and they didn't send their money back to China. They married and spent their money here, and in this way the Government was able to open up the country from jungle to civilisation. We've become inseparable from this country. It's ours, our country...\\" Irked Malay intellectuals objected to this reasoning, and proposed an analogy with the Chinese as masons and Malaya as a house. A paid mason, they argued, was not entitled to a share in the ownership rights to a home he built. As such, they opposed any attempt to grant the Chinese citizenship or other political rights.Roff, pp. 207‚Äì210. However, not all Malays were natives of Malaya. A number of other distinct ethnic groups related to the Malays, such as the Javanese and Bugis, migrated to Malaya from elsewhere in the region throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Most of them were quickly assimilated into the Malay cultural identity.Abdullah & Pedersen, p. 20. Eventually, the Chinese appeals appeared to affect the British. In 1927, the Governor of the Straits Settlements which comprised Penang, Malacca and :Singapore, proclaimed that \\"The Chinese form today a majority of the indigenous inhabitants of British Malaya, and they are perhaps the most enterprising, energetic, provident and frugal of its sons.\\"Hickling, R.H. (1991). Essays in Malaysian Law, pp. 51‚Äì52. Pelanduk Publications. . In 1938, the leftist Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) was formed by Ibrahim Yaacob and other activists in Kuala Lumpur, with its main goal ostensibly being the formation of Greater Indonesia. During this period, Malay nationalism began to focus on ketuanan Melayu, which in the past had been taken for granted. Some Malays began to worry that the British policies appeared geared towards the creation of a common Malayan nationality inclusive of the Chinese and Indians. Ironically, some of them thus sought to preserve the status quo with the British as a bulwark against the non-Malays, while others began agitating for an independent and sovereign Malay nation, such as Greater Indonesia.Roff, pp. 235‚Äì236. There exists some dispute over which goal KMM actually sought, with some former members alleging that the only interest of KMM had been preserving the special position of the Malays, whatever the cost, and others claiming that there had been real plans to overthrow the British. Historians have been unable to verify either claim due to a lack of documentation from the period.Roff, pp. 232‚Äì233. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II in Asia, the British detained several influential KMM leaders. However, most of them were freed during World War II, when the Japanese invaded and occupied Malaya. The former KMM leaders then formed Kesatuan Rakyat Indonesia Semenanjung (KRIS) to carry on KMM's work. However, the planned Greater Indonesia never materialised due to the sudden Japanese surrender after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With the return of the British, the KRIS leaders formed the Malay Nationalist Party (MNP; also known as the Persatuan Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya or PKMM) to achieve their goals through democratic means. However, the MNP was soon banned by the government as part of a crack-down on left-wing parties, ending the early phase of Malay nationalism.Jawan, Jayum A. (2003). Malaysian Politics & Government, pp. 32‚Äì33. Karisma Publications. . The Malayan Union After World War II, the British announced the establishment of the Malayan Union, which would have loose immigration policies, reduce the sovereignty of the Malay rulers both in name and reality, and not recognise Malay sovereignty over Malaya. It would also establish Malaya as a protectorate of the United Kingdom. A large percentage of the Chinese and Indians ‚Äì 83 and 75 percent, respectively ‚Äì would qualify for citizenship under the jus soli principle applied by the Union, which would grant citizenship to all locally born residents. With equal rights guaranteed to all, the Malays feared that what little power they had left would soon be taken away from them. Even their traditional stronghold, the civil service, would be open to all Malayans.Hwang, p. 37.Ongkili, James P. (1985). Nation-building in Malaysia 1946‚Äì1974, p. 42. Oxford University Press. . For what many commentators agree appears to be the first time, the Malays became politically conscious, organising rallies and marches to protest the Malayan Union's formation. At one such gathering, placards were hoisted, declaring that \\"Malaya Belongs to the Malays. We do not want the other races to be given the rights and privileges of the Malays.\\"Ongkili, p. 47. The Pan- Malayan Malay Congress of Malay leaders sent a telegram to the British government protesting the Malayan Union's formation, and elaborated on this by asserting that the citizenship provisions constituted a threat to the future of Malaya, eventually leading to \\"the wiping from existence of the Malay race along with their land and Rulers\\".Ongkili, p. 50. A group of Malay royalists and civil servants formed the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to protest the Malayan Union's formation. Led by Dato' Onn Ja'afar, UMNO organised a campaign and co-ordinated several previously divided Malay organisations against the Union's creation.Hwang, p. 38. Although the Union was established as planned, the campaign continued; in 1948, the British retired the Malayan Union in favour of the Federation of Malaya, whose constitution restored sovereignty to the Malay rulers, tightened immigration and citizenship restrictions, and gave the Malays special privileges.Hwang, p. 39. Nevertheless, the avowed goal of the British remained the same as it had been in 1946: to introduce \\"a form of common citizenship open to all those, irrespective of race, who regarded Malaya as their real home and as the object of their loyalty.\\"Hickling, p. 87. A limited form of opposition to ketuanan Melayu and UMNO during this period came from the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action (AMCJA) which initially opposed the Malayan Union because of its exclusion of Singapore, lack of universal suffrage, and restricted civil liberties. The AMCJA, which was an amalgamation of several smaller organisations and trade unions, claimed to be the only organisation sufficiently representative of Malaya to be able to negotiate with the British, and demanded a place at the bargaining table with the British for negotiations on the Federation's formation. Later, the MNP (which had not been deregistered yet) and several other Malay organisations left the UMNO fold and formed the Pusat Tenaga Raayat (PUTERA). Although the MNP had insisted on ketuanan Melayu as a \\"National Birthright\\" of the Malays, PUTERA forged a compromise with the AMCJA to work together towards, among other things, \\"Equal political rights for all who regarded Malaya as their real home and as the object of their loyalty.\\" Even so, not all was smooth sailing; the original name of the AMCJA had used the phrase \\"All-Malayan\\", but this was altered after PUTERA objected, as the Malays perceived the term \\"Malayan\\" to specifically exclude the Malays. After the British refused to appoint a Malayan to head the Consultative Committee which would canvass the views of Malayans on the existing proposals for the Federation, the PUTERA-AMCJA coalition pulled out of negotiations with the British. Nevertheless, they continued to influence Malayan politics right until the formation of the Federation in 1948, when they launched a hartal (boycott) to protest perceived defects in the Federation proposal. The hartal is estimated to have cost the Malayan economy ¬£4 million. After the Federation was formed over their objections, the coalition disbanded.Ongkili, pp. 59‚Äì66, 73. Prior to the formation of the Federation, the non-Malays were generally uninvolved in Malayan politics and nationalism, which was essentially Malay in nature. During the tenure of the Malayan Union, there was never any major political backing from either the Chinese or Indians, both of which were more interested in the politics of their respective homelands.Jawan, p. 37. The AMCJA, although mostly non-Malay, did not represent a large section of the non-Malay communities in Malaya.Ongkili, p. 68. As a result, some historians have pinpointed the failure of the Malayan Union as the incident that made Chinese keenly aware of the need for political representation in Malaya, attributing to it the formation of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) ‚Äì a communal political party which desired the Chinese to have equal political rights as the Malays over Malaya, directly challenging the concept of ketuanan Melayu.Ye, p. 34. Others, however, argue that the main driving force behind non-Malay involvement in Malayan politics, and their assertion of certain rights, was the increasing number of local-born non-Malays. The same report from the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies cited earlier said that \\"Those who have been born in Malaya themselves, or whose children have been born there ... state that in a great many cases those concerned have never seen the land of their origin and they claim that their children and their children's children should have fair treatment.\\"Hwang, p. 25. The inaugural President of the MCA was Tan Cheng Lock, a local-born Peranakan who had led the AMCJA until its breaking up. Towards independence Having achieved their initial goals, UMNO's leaders decided to become more involved in the political process, and to establish their organisation as a political party to fight for independence. At the same time, the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) decided to launch an armed insurgency against what they viewed as a puppet state of the British, culminating in the Malayan Emergency which would last until after independence. The insurgency was marked by a clear racial divide; the opposition to the insurrection was almost entirely Malay, while those seen fighting in the communist ranks were nearly always Chinese. This exacerbated racial tensions, leading the British to advise Onn Ja'afar to work together with other Malayan community leaders for the benefit of Malayan politics. Eventually, after some informal meetings between Onn, Tan Cheng Lock, and E.E.C. Thuraisingham, the Communities Liaison Committee (CLC) was established. The CLC became a focal point for the top echelon of Malayan politicians over the next few years, hammering out proposals and compromises on a number of issues, including citizenship, education, democracy, and resolving the impasse on ketuanan Melayu. It was eventually decided that a \\"bargain\\" would be forged between the Malays and non-Malays; in return for giving up ketuanan Melayu (referred to as the Malays' special position), the Malays would receive assistance from the non- Malays in closing the economic gap between the impoverished and overwhelmingly rural Malays with the substantially better off and urban non-Malays. Thuraisingham later said, \\"It is true. I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal. Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non-Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals.\\"Ongkili, pp. 82‚Äì84. Still, problems continued to crop up. When the Malayan government implemented a system of national service, whereby Malayan youths would be conscripted into the army to stave off communist attacks. Many Chinese refused to participate, fleeing to Hong Kong or mainland China via Singapore. Only 1,800 Chinese registered for the draft, many of them English-educated. The Chinese press opposed national service as well, with the Sin Chew Jit Poh arguing that skilled workers and teachers, as well as first-born sons, be exempted. The Nanyang Siang Pau insisted that the Chinese be granted citizenship before being called to defend Malaya against the communists, while the China Press stated its preference for a voluntary army. Tan Cheng Lock also spoke out in defence of the Chinese opposition, saying that the Chinese traditionally gave their loyalty to their family and locality instead of their nation, with the \\"Western\\" concept of social obligation all but unknown to the vast majority of Chinese. A similar system in Chinese-majority Singapore was implemented later that decade, with similar results. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.Ongkili, p. 84. Later, the British government implemented the Briggs Plan, which moved Chinese villagers living near the jungles, who often voluntarily provided or were coerced into providing assistance and supplies to MCP guerillas, to \\"New Villages\\". These New Villages, which were equipped with amenities such as electricity and piped water, were surrounded with perimeter fencing and armed guards to prevent attacks from the communist soldiers. It was hoped that by providing the Chinese with such facilities, they would be converted from \\"reservoirs of resentment into bastions of loyal Malayan citizenry\\". However, critics argue that the homogenous nature of New Villages ‚Äì with the few multiracial ones eventually failing or turning into ghettoes ‚Äì worked against this goal, instead accentuating communalist fervour and causing racial polarisation, especially in politics, as electoral constituencies would now be delineated more along racial lines. Previously, the Chinese had been spread out geographically, but the Briggs Plan would now bring together rural Chinese from all over the country and concentrate them in the New Villages. There was significant resentment towards the programme both among the Chinese and Malays. The Chinese frequently suffered from collective punishment, preventive detention and summary deportation aimed at weeding out communist supporters, while the Malays were incensed at the infrastructure provided for the New Villages as their own settlements remained undeveloped.Ongkili, pp. 85‚Äì88. In the early 1950s, Onn Ja'afar begin to agitate in favour of opening UMNO membership to all Malayans, and to rename it as the United Malayan National Organisation. He was defeated, however, in an internal power struggle, and resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as \\"the Tunku\\"). Upon succeeding to the UMNO Presidency, the Tunku insisted that sovereignty over the Malaya be given to the Malays, and expressed concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, demanding that they clarify their allegiance before they were accorded citizenship. He went on to say that \\"For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays.\\"Putra, Tunku Abdul Rahman (1986). Political Awakening, pp. 30, 31. Pelanduk Publications. . Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that \\"Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races.\\" Malays, he argued, would have to safeguard their rights over Malaya, \\"which is ours, for the benefit of our future generation.\\"Josey, Alex (1980). Lee Kuan Yew: The Crucial Years, pp. 83‚Äì84. Times Books International. . During the early 1950s, there was an active Straits Chinese secessionist movement in Penang agitating against ketuanan Melayu. During this period, some Straits Chinese began taking an active interest in local politics, especially in Penang, where there was an active Chinese secessionist movement. They identified themselves more with the British than the Malays and were especially angered by references to them as pendatang asing (\\"aliens\\"). They avoided both UMNO and the MCA, believing that while UMNO and the Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights, the MCA was too \\"selfish\\", and could not be relied on to protect their interests.Sopiee, Mohamed Noordin (1976). From Malayan Union to Singapore Separation: Political Unification in the Malaysia Region 1945 ‚Äì 65, pp. 77 ‚Äì 78. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. No ISBN available. They had already raised their ire in the late 1940s, when the government proposed to amend the Banishment Ordinance ‚Äî which allowed for the exile of Malayans \\"implicated in acts of violence\\"Drohan, Brian (2006). \\"An integrated approach: British political-military strategy in the Malayan emergency\\". Retrieved 11 April 2006. ‚Äì to permit those born in the Straits Settlements to be banished to their ancestral homeland. This was a revolting idea for most of the Straits Chinese. They were also uncomfortable about the merger of the Straits Settlements with Malaya, as they did not feel a sense of belonging to what they considered a \\"Malaya for the Malays\\", where they were not considered bumiputra (\\"sons of the soil\\"). One Straits Chinese leader indignantly declared, \\"I can claim to be more anak Pulau Pinang [a son of Penang] than 99 per cent of the Malays living here today.\\"Sopiee, pp. 61 ‚Äì 62. The secessionist movement eventually petered out, however, because of the government's stout refusal to entertain the idea of Penang seceding from the Federation.Sopiee, p. 69. Another problem that the government was forced to confront was increasing tension on the subject of citizenship and nationality. The provisions of the Federation's citizenship laws insisted that citizenship \\"was not a nationality, neither could it develop into a nationality.\\" As a result, critics postulated that non-Malay Malayans could not feel a sense of allegiance towards Malaya, or take interest in Malayan politics as opposed to those of their respective ancestral homelands. To counter this, in 1952 the government issued an ordinance that granted citizenship to almost 1.5 million non-Malays, and also prohibited dual citizenship, forcing the non-Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya. After the passing of the ordinance, only 1.3 million Malayan residents out of 5.7 million were without Malayan citizenship, and the bulk of these (about 0.9 million) had been born outside Malaya. Although praised by some as a \\"clear stimulus to the evolution of a Malayan people\\", others claimed the ordinance had not created a single Malayan nationality that all could relate to.Ongkili, pp. 88‚Äì90. As Malaya began moving to self-government, the British initiated the Member System, through which various political leaders were appointed to posts in charge of certain \\"portfolios\\", modelled after the cabinet system. The Member System was later described as setting a precedent for the multiracial Malayan and Malaysian cabinets post-independence.Ongkili, pp. 90‚Äì91. At the same time, the British also began laying the framework for a national education system that would \\"provide...for the creation of a sense of common citizenship\\". In 1951, they commissioned the Barnes Report on the state of Malayan education, which postulated that the British policy of providing only limited education for the Malays had shackled them to a life of few opportunities, arguing that \\"Now even if he [the Malay] wanted education he could no longer afford it.\\" The report recommended the establishment of an \\"inter-racial primary school we call the National School\\" that would provide a platform for \\"build[ing] up a common Malay nationality\\". The report made no provision for non-Malay vernacular schools, stating that its proposal \\"would be seriously weakened if any large proportion of the Chinese, Indian and other non-Malay communities to provide their own primary classes independently of the National School\\". To reassure the non-Malay populace, the report guaranteed that the National School would \\"teach English to all\\", instead of Malay as feared by many. Nevertheless, the proposal was resoundingly rejected by the non-Malays, especially the Chinese, who accused it of being \\"saturated with Malay nationalism\\" and bolstering ketuanan Melayu. The British commissioned another report, the Fenn-Wu Report, to provide a Chinese perspective. The Fenn-Wu Report clashed with the Barnes Report on a number of points, recommending the retention of Chinese schools and suggesting that \\"No element of the population can be 'Malayanized' for the simple reason that there is no 'Malayan' pattern to which to mould it...\\" The Fenn-Wu Report also proposed an alteration of the Chinese vernacular syllabus to eliminate \\"[f]oreign politics\\" and recommended that texts \\"suitable for Malayan use should be produced\\". The Federal Legislative Council then set up a committee led by Thuraisingham to evaluate the Reports and make a final recommendation. The eventual proposal provided for the setting up of national schools as based on the Barnes Report, without any provision for vernacular schools. Although the media of instruction would be Malay and English, vernacular language classes would be permitted in schools where 15 or more students requested them. The Chinese community protested the final proposal, but in the end, it was endorsed by the MCA and the system was duly established as planned with the enactment of the 1952 Education Ordinance.Ongkili, pp. 107‚Äì109. In 1956, a committee headed by Tun Abdul Razak was set up to re-evaluate the education system. The Razak Report eventually recommended that vernacular primary schools be permitted to continue, but be required to adhere to a common syllabus with the national schools. However, there would be no official sanction for vernacular secondary schools, and only national secondary schools would be allowed. The Chinese community strenuously objected to the Razak Report's recommendations as well, launching an organised campaign against it. When the MCA refused to voice any dissent towards the proposal, it lost the Ipoh-Menglembu by-election held in Perak the following year. Ipoh, a largely Chinese city, became an opposition stronghold from then on, due to Chinese antipathy towards the MCA.Ongkili, pp. 109‚Äì111. Nevertheless, the Razak Report's recommendations were largely successful, and many of them remain in place today, as of 2006. Possible causes According to many historians, the root cause of this strife between the ethnic communities and Malay nationalist sentiments like ketuanan Melayu was the lack of assimilation or amalgamation between the Malays and non- Malays. Because most of the migrants came as \\"guest workers\\" of the British, they felt little need to integrate into Malay society. (The Straits Chinese, most of whom were rich merchants instead of manual labourers, were an exception and managed to assimilate reasonably well, with many of them habitually speaking Malay at home, dressing in the Malay style, and preferring Malay cuisine.) Few bothered to even learn the Malay language; the census taken at independence showed that only 3% of Chinese aged ten and over, and 5% of Indians in the same age group, were literate in Malay. The comparable figure for the Malays stood at 46%.Hwang, pp. 25‚Äì26. The British educational policies, which segregated the different ethnicities‚Äî providing minimal public education for the Malays, and leaving the non-Malays to their own devices ‚Äì did little to help matters. The Malays, who were predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the non-Malays, most of whom resided in towns.Hwang, pp. 30‚Äì31. The economic impoverishment of the Malays, which set them apart from the better-off Chinese, also helped fan racial sentiments. This failure to assimilate or amalgamate has in turn been blamed on the British. George Maxwell, a high ranking colonial civil servant, credited the Malay aristocracy for its acceptance of non-Malay participation in public life, and attributed political discrimination to British colonial policy: On the basis of these policies, historians have argued that \\"Given the hostility toward Chinese expressed by many colonial officials and the lack of physical and social integration, it is not surprising that most Malays formed the opinion that Chinese were only transients in Malaya with no real attachments to the country.\\" Another contributing factor to ketuanan Melayu, according to historians, was the Japanese occupation during World War II. One states that the war \\"awakened a keen political awareness among Malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred.\\" This was widely attributed to the Japanese policies which \\"politicised the Malay peasantry\\" and intentionally fanned the flames of Malay nationalism. Racial tension was also increased by the Japanese practice of using Malay paramilitary units to fight Chinese resistance groups. Two Malay historians wrote that \\"The Japanese hostile acts against the Chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of the Malays helped to make the Chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely ... it was also the beginning of racial tension between the Malays and Chinese.\\"Hwang, p. 34. A foreign commentator agreed, stating that \\"During the occupation period ... Malay national sentiment had become a reality; it was strongly anti-Chinese, and its rallying cry [was] 'Malaya for the Malays'...\\"Hwang, p. 35.

Written by guitarist Keith Richards, the song is a response to his arrest for heroin possession in Toronto in February 1977. The criminal charges and prospect of a prison sentence loomed over the Some Girls recording sessions and endangered the future of the Rolling Stones. In the lyrics, Richards reflects unapologetically on his lifestyle up to that point. The line \\"it's another goodbye to another good friend\\" in the first verse can be interpreted as referring to Gram Parsons, Richards's close friend who died in 1973 from a drug overdose,Appleford 2000. pg. 162-163 and/or to heroin itself: Richards had sought medical treatment for heroin addiction following his arrest in Toronto, and his resolution to overcome his addiction would be a significant factor in his upcoming trial. Richards recorded the song in five days without sleeping. Originally entitled \\"Rotten Roll\\", the song was recorded in a Paris studio in March 1978 during one of Mick Jagger's absences from the Some Girls sessions. The completed track - \\"a high-energy rock & roller\\"Elliott 2002. pg. 262  features Richards on lead vocals, acoustic and electric guitars and bass; Ronnie Wood on pedal steel guitar, slide guitar and backing vocals, Charlie Watts on drums, and Jagger on backing vocals. Richards first performed the song in concert on the New Barbarians' tour of North America in 1979; it was not until the Steel Wheels Tour in 1989 that it entered the Rolling Stones' concert repertoire. Like \\"Happy\\", the song has become one of Richards' \\"signature tunes\\", performed on most Rolling Stones tours since 1989; he also played it on the X-Pensive Winos' 1992-93 tours promoting his album Main Offender. Live performances of the song are included in the Stones' 2003 Four Flicks DVD collection and as bonus tracks in their 2013 and 2016 DVD & Blu-ray sets Sweet Summer Sun: Hyde Park Live and Havana Moon. Steve Earle has also performed the song in concert and has recorded it as part of a split single with the Supersuckers.

They successfully stole over $50,000 in an eight-month period from August 1938 to April 1939. A husband and wife team in the style of Bonnie and Clyde, Bennie Dickson and his newlywed wife \\"Sure Shot\\" Stella began their criminal career on Stella's 16th birthday by robbing a bank in Elkton, South Dakota of $2,174 on August 25, 1938. Two months later, they stole $47,233 in cash and bonds from a bank in Brookings, South Dakota on October 31. Although tracked by police to a tourist campground in Topeka, Kansas, the Dicksons were able to escape after a brief gunfight when officers attempted to arrest them on November 24. Separated during the escape, Bennie drove his car to South Clinton, Iowa, and after stealing another car, doubled back to Topeka to meet Stella at a rendezvous on November 25. Traveling to Michigan, several attempts over the next few days were made by authorities to capture them, including one incident in which Stella shot the tires out on a pursuing patrol car (earning her the moniker \\"Sure Shot\\" Stella). After taking three men hostage, Bennie and Stella were able to steal getaway cars in Michigan and Indiana, later eluding police on the countryside backroads. Shortly after arriving in St. Louis, Bennie was shot and killed by arresting FBI agents while at a hamburger stand on April 6, 1939, with Stella being arrested in Kansas City the following day. Taken back to South Dakota to stand trial, Stella was convicted of two federal counts of bank robbery and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Stella Dickson remained behind bars until she was 26.

In 1932, Fr. Van Runckelen expanded the school, and with Mrs. Gloria Aspillera-Quintos, he founded the high school department. The new department started with 32 students (20 boys and 12 girls) and ended up to seven (four boys and three girls); moreover, the seven were the first high school graduates dubbed as The Magnificent Seven. Upon the demise of Fr. Van Runckelen (‚Ä† Para√±aque, October 24, 1934), Rev. Fr. Antonio Van Overveld took over as head of St. Andrew's School from 1934 to 1937.

He fought in Sulla's Second Civil War, Lepidus' failed rebellion of 77 BC and from 76-72 BC in the Sertorian War. He conspired against and assassinated Quintus Sertorius, and was defeated and executed by Pompey the Great. Name The names Perperna and Perpenna are attested for this nomen gentile (of Etruscan origin), but Perperna is more frequent and the form used in the most reliable inscriptions, followed by the prosopographical scholarship (e.g. Broughton). Early life and career Not much is known about Perperna before the civil wars against Sulla. Perperna was a member of the Cinna-Marius faction during their war against the Sullan faction. He governed the island of Sicily as propraetor during the second civil war.John Leach, Pompey the Great pp.28-29. After Sulla defeated the populares faction in Italy he sent his new stepson-in-law Pompey (Pompey had married Aemilia, Sulla's stepdaughter) to recover Sicily and Africa. Perperna abandoned the island upon hearing of the size and nature of the force sent against him. After Sulla became Dictator of Rome, Perperna was proscripted and went into exile. After Sulla's death he was recalled by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the consul of 78 BC, whom he joined in rebellion against the Sullan faction. Lepidus marched his army on Rome but was defeated by Quintus Lutatius Catulus (Capitolinus) in a brisk military action just outside of the city while Lepidus' legate Marcus Junius Brutus was defeated by Pompey at Mutina.John Leach, Pompey the Great p.43. Perperna and Lepidus pulled their forces back through Etruria to the island of Sardinia. Lepidus died while on Sardinia - by some accounts of a broken heart - brought on not by his failed bit for power but by the accidental discovery that his wife had been unfaithful to him. In 76 BC Perperna took their army - a substantial affair of several legions - to Liguria and continued the rebellion. After he found out Pompey and a very large army had been sent to defeat him (on route to the Iberian Peninsula and the war against Sertorius) he decided to take his forces to Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.86-93. Sertorian War Perperna's soldiers were dissatisfied with his leadership, and when they learned that Pompey was crossing the Pyrenees, they demanded that Perperna take them to Sertorius, or they would abandon him to Pompey's mercies while they took themselves to Sertorius. Perperna yielded to the demands of the legions, and handed them over to Sertorius. This was not done with good will, and Perperna, conscious of his noble bloodline and wealth, viewed the entire affair as a humiliation.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15. Sertorius welcomed Perperna and his troops (a sizeable force of 53 cohorts) and put them to good use.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.91. He sent Perperna with 20,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry to join Herennius (one of Sertorius' legates) in the territory of the Ilercaones, with instructions to guard the crossing of the lower Ebro and try and lure Pompey into an ambush. Pompey managed to cross the Ebro unhindered and marched to the plain of Valentia where he came to grips with Sertorius himself (see: Battle of Lauron).John Leach, Pompey the Great p.46. At the beginning of the campaigning season of 75 BC Perperna, Herennius and their army were defeated by Pompey in a bloody battle near Valentia. Herennius was among the 10,000 casualties and the city of Valentia was taken and sacked. Perperna gathered what was left of his army and retreated westward towards Sertorius who was campaining in Hispania UlteriorJohn Leach, Pompey the Great p. 48. After the Valentia disaster Sertorius himself returned to the eastern theatre (he had been in the west of the Iberian Peninsula campaigning against Metellus) to take command of the fight against Pompey. Perperna was given command of a substantial force to block Metellus from coming to Pompey's aid. Sertorius tried to take out Pompey at the Battle of Sucro while Perperna tried to stop Metellus, both failed.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 121-122. At the battle of Saguntum Perperna was in command of one of the wings of Sertorius' army. He fought Pompey then had to switch places with his commander and took on Metellus. During the battle, the biggest of the war, Perperna lost 6,000 men. After the battle Sertorius and Perperna withdrew inland and reverted to guerilla warfare.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 127-128. In 74 BC, while Sertorius focused his attention on defending his allies in celtiberia, Perperna circumvented the Romans operating in the interior and marched to the Iberian westcoast where he took the city of Cale.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 146. The war was not going well and the Roman nobles and senators that made up the higher classes of his domain became discontented with Sertorius. They grew jealous of Sertorius' power, and Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius' place, encouraged that jealousy for his own ends. They took to damaging Sertorius by oppressing the local Iberian tribes in his name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, which resulted in a cycle of oppression and revolt, with Sertorius none the wiser as to who was creating such mischief. Perperna then proceeded to invite Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. At this, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they murdered the unsuspecting Sertorius on the spot.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 153-154. Upon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. Now that Sertorius was dead, his virtues were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 156-157. ::People are generally less angry with those who died, and when they no longer see him right in front of them they tend to dwell tenderly on his virtues. So it was with Sertorius. Anger against him suddenly turned to affection and the soldiers clamorously rose up in protest against Perperna.Appian, Civil Wars, 1.114. When Sertorius's will was read his people found out he had named Perperna his chief beneficiary. Perperna had already dishonoured himself in the eyes of many by slaining his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, and now it was revealed he had killed his main benefactor as well. Death Perperna managed to retain control of some of the Roman renegades who had followed Sertorius, but he needed a quick victory to gain his people's trust. Unfortunately for Perperna and his men, Pompey had set a trap: he feigned a retreat and ambushed them. Pompey lured Perperna's army into his ambush using 10 cohorts as bait. He allowed these to be attacked while scattered over a wide area, perhaps foraging, and as they fled they drew Perperna's army into the hidden lines of the main army. As these attacked from ambush the 10 cohorts turned and attacked their pursuers from the front. The ensuing massacre was decisive.John Leach, Pompey Great, p.52. Pompey's successful ambush proved Plutarch's disparaging comment 'Perperna was as bad at command as he was at following orders'. Perperna attempted to plead for his life, offering to give Pompey all of Sertorius' correspondence, which would document contacts with the highest levels of Roman government and society. Pompey indicated he would accept the papers, and when they had all been gathered together, he burned them, averting the possibility of another civil war. He then executed Perperna and all of the men who had murdered Sertorius.

The character was first introduced in December 1989 and originally left in January 1999. Kim returned for a brief stint from 8 to 12 October 2018, before returning permanently on 14 March 2019. Often regarded as one of the greatest villains in British soap opera history, Kim's story arc mostly revolved around her dysfunctional marriage to local businessman Frank Tate (Norman Bowler), her uneasy relationship with her stepchildren, Chris (Peter Amory) and Zoe (Leah Bracknell), and her cunning ambition to control the family business. Frank threw her out on Christmas Day 1992 after her affair with The Rt Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon), but the pair later remarried after coping through the infamous plane crash disaster that occurred between the end of 1993 and the start of 1994. Their second marriage lasted until Kim embarked on a prolonged affair with her younger farmhand Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey), which resulted in the latter's death on Christmas Day 1996 he saved Frank and Kim's son James from a fire at their house, Home Farm. Following the plane crash disaster, Kim became the show's central antagonist for the rest of her first duration on the show. This was first impacted in 1997 when, after becoming a public enemy in light of her affair with Dave, the character was seemingly killed off upon last appearing on 5 February that year. However, it was soon revealed on 22 May 1997 that Kim had actually faked her own death in order to get revenge on Frank; on that dated episode, she reappeared herself and coldly watched on as Frank was dying of a heart attack in shock at her apparent return from the dead. Afterwards, Kim took control of Frank's business empire and went on to proceed in becoming arch-enemies with Frank's son Chris (Peter Amory). Their longstanding rivalry contributes to some of Kim's other major storylines and interactions, most notably with Chris' sister Zoe (Leah Bracknell). During that time, Kim developed an unlikely friendship with elderly poacher Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards); formed a business partnership with wealthy entrepreneur Lord Alex Oakwell (Rupam Maxwell) that culminates with him causing the death of Zoe's best friend, Linda Fowler (Tonicha Jeronimo), on the show's 25th anniversary episode; found herself blackmailed by an unknown person on Christmas Day 1997, which involved James being abducted by a mysterious kidnapper - who later turned out to be Linda's mother Jan Glover (Roberta Kerr); and sparked a relationship with Frank's ex-business associate Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic) that led to the pair getting married on 7 May 1998, and later attempting to steal a horse in a bid to solve their financial troubles - which resulted in Kim framing Steve for the crime after their plan led to him running over Chris' ex-wife Kathy Bates (Malandra Burrows) in a car. On 19 January 1999, Kim escaped the village in a helicopter with both James and the ¬£190,000 that she reclaimed from Chris - who had recovered it from his father's grave in a last-ditch attempt to bring her to justice for Frank's death - after knocking her stepson unconscious with a paperweight. Nearly two decades later in October 2018, Kim returned in a week of episodes that saw the character being revealed to be the mastermind behind the events of the show's longest-serving local family, the Dingles, being endangered of losing their home, with her step-grandson Joe (Ned Porteous) carrying out the plot in his bid to exact revenge on his former stepmother Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) for her mistaken involvement in Chris' death. The week of episodes saw Kim being pushed off a balcony at Home Farm by Charity's ex-fianc√©'s mother, Faith (Sally Dexter), before being sent back to prison for dangerous driving. After returning to the show in 14 March 2019, Kim became the show's main antagonist once more and her second stint mostly followed her one-off relationship with Joe's legal guardian Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough) - who later turned out to be Kim's third husband. This triggered the events of the \\"Who Killed Graham?\\" storyline, wherein Kim and her business associate Al Chapman (Michael Wildman) planned to kill Graham after discovering that he had been extracting money from them. Throughout both of her stints on the programme, Kim has embarked on numerous feuds with the likes of Kathy and Charity themselves - as well as Kathy's best-friend Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay); Dave's father Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze); Linda's husband Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade); Alex Oakwell's trophy-wife Tara Cockburn (Anna Brecon); Charity's daughter Debbie (Charley Webb), who was formerly engaged to Joe prior to his \\"demise\\"; Debbie's father Cain (Jeff Hordley); Graham's girlfriend Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry); Cain's wife Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb); and Jamie's wife Andrea Tate (Anna Nightingale). Storylines=1989‚Äì1999 Kim had an affair with Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) while she worked as his secretary. They later married after Frank's wife, Jean, died of cancer. Kim initially got on well with her stepchildren Chris (Peter Amory) and Zoe (Leah Bracknell), but her marriage to Frank soon wore her down. The Tate family move to Beckindale in late 1989 as the new owners of Home Farm. Despite an initial hostile reception from the villagers, including the arson of one of the family's caravans in 1990, they soon settle in and the family are happy for a short time. However, when Kim becomes pregnant and later loses the child, Frank falls into a deep depression and turns to alcohol, neglecting Kim in the process. Kim befriends The Rt Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon), a family friend, who is much closer to her own age and shares her equine interests. The pair find themselves travelling to auctions together and eventually, realizing their attraction to one another, consummate their relationship and embark on an affair. They soon come under threat from Chris' wife, Kathy (Malandra Burrows), when she discovers a hotel bill that Neil accidentally dropped at Home Farm. The secret remains safe until Christmas Day 1992, when Frank finds an expensive watch he'd believed to be his present being worn by Neil. Kim is thrown out of Home Farm by Frank, residing at Neil's into the New Year and divorcing her husband. After Kim and Frank separate in 1993, she sets up stables under her maiden name of Kim Barker. This, however, doesn't last long as the stables are destroyed in the plane crash in December that year, killing many of the horses. After the plane crash, Frank and Kim put aside their differences and reconcile, remarrying in December 1994; Zoe becomes thoroughly skeptical of her father's decision, while Chris never trusted Kim again. In 1995, Kim begins an affair with Kathy's boyfriend Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey), shortly after Kathy had divorced Chris for having an affair with her best-friend, Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay). This time Kim is much more ruthless about keeping the affair secret and tramples Kathy's brother Nick with her horse when he threatened to expose her. She also threatens Nick's daughter Alice. When Frank has a heart attack and is advised to take it easy, Kim encourages him to sleep with her in the hope of inducing another heart attack. Kim became pregnant and isn't sure who the father is. When Frank overhears Dave and Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) discussing the situation, he has another heart attack and ends up in hospital. He then has time to think and decided to pretend not to know about the affair while hiring a private detective to follow Kim and Dave before confronting his wife with the evidence. He also hires scheming Tina Dingle as a secretary in Home Farm who uses to wind Kim up by wearing her dresses that Frank had bought. He offers her a million pounds to dump Dave and name him as the father and Kim accepts. Their son was named James Francis Tate. Frank dies (1997) However, after bonding with the baby, Kim and Dave resume their relationship, despite the fact that Kathy had forgiven his affair and married him. They plan to run away together, but a fire breaks out at Home Farm and Dave dies in hospital on Boxing Day 1996 of injuries sustained while rescuing baby James. In February 1997, Kim disappears from the village, and a few days later a woman was found dead at the wheel of her car. Frank identifies the body as Kim; however, in May Frank is stunned when Kim returns, revealing she had paid a lookalike prostitute to drive her car around the village to fool people into thinking she was still there (when in fact she had fled to the Caribbean) and that it is her body, not Kim's, that Frank had identified. The shock causes Frank, who had spent time on remand for her murder, to have another heart attack, this time fatal. Kim watches him die, saying \\"You're a dinosaur Frank ‚Äì and you know what happened to them\\", checks he is dead with her compact mirror, then coolly redid her make-up. Chris blames her for his death and swears revenge. After Frank's will is read out, Kim inherits a half share of Home Farm. She later starts seeing Frank's business partner, Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic), who also had a share in Home Farm, and they soon marry in May 1998. As time went on, however, the couple became on the verge of financial bankruptcy and they soon planned to restore their problems by stealing a horse and selling it after replacing it with an older horse in the hope that no one would notice the difference. In September 1998, Steve stole the horse-box and nearly managed to flee scot-free, until he ended up running over Kathy. He later attempts to kill her in hospital, but Kim stops him after learning about the incident. Once Steve has gone, Kim manages to talk to Kathy when she is alone and reveals the truth about her hit-and-run incident ‚Äì all the while hiding her involvement behind the plan of stealing horse. Kathy, manipulated by Kim, reports Steve to the police and he is arrested and charged. Steve learns of Kim's betrayal after puzzling the pieces behind her scheme. On the day of trial in January 1999, when the lawyers begin to question Kathy's validity as a witness for Steve's hit-and-run crime, Kathy herself begins to question how true Kim's words are. For this, and numerous other crooked tricks, the police are soon on Kim's trail. Needing to escape, Kim discovers that Chris has found the money from the robbery that she had buried in Frank's grave. She confronts Chris, tries seducing him, and knocks him out with a paperweight when he is not fooled. Then she confesses that she had indeed, as he speculated, caused his father's death ‚Äì in precisely the location Chris is lying in. She leaves with her son, James, in a helicopter. The pilot asks her if she is Kim Marchant, and she replies, \\"No, Kim Tate\\". Shortly afterwards, her plan to frame Steve for their fraudulent dealings succeeded when he was found guilty; Steve was consequently sentenced to 10 years for Kathy's hit-and-run and 12 months for the crimes Kim had been charged with. In 2005, she sends flowers to Emmerdale for the funeral of Seth, and it is believed that she has since resided in Ireland. By 2013, Kim was sent to prison and sent James to boarding school. 2018‚Äì Kim is released from prison in October 2018 and greeted by Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough) at the gate, who hands her the keys to Home Farm. Kim finds out that her former step-grandson, Joe (Ned Porteous), has run into financial trouble on the day of his wedding to Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb). Kim arrives in Emmerdale and declares herself the owner of Home Farm once again and demands that Graham get rid of Joe. Instead, Graham packs Joe a bag and gives him ¬£100,000 and demands him to leave Emmerdale before Kim arrives. During the welcome home party, Kim insults and alienates various people, including Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton), Nicola King (Nicola Wheeler) and Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop), and when she goes upstairs, she is pushed from the upstairs balcony by an unseen assailant and plummets onto the champagne fountain below. She is rushed to hospital and survives the incident. Later, Debbie's mother Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) is arrested on suspicion of pushing Kim as she and Kim were seen arguing during the party after insulting her and Chris's son, Noah (Jack Downham). However, it is later revealed that Debbie's grandmother, Faith Dingle (Sally Dexter), is the real culprit who pushed Kim. After she is discharged from hospital, Kim is detained again for six months for dangerous driving. In March 2019, Graham picks Kim up from prison and they drive back to Home Farm; however, the car slows down to a complete stop - forcing Graham to go out for help. While waiting, Kim flags down Debbie's father and Faith's son, Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) - when he comes across her. At first Cain helps Kim, but the two end up in an argument after he learns who she is. When Graham informs Kim that Cain killed Joe, having falsely claimed to have done the job himself, Kim plans to implicate Cain for Joe's murder. Kim tries to get Cain on her side, but he refuses. Later, Kim finds money has gone missing from an offshore account and catches Graham making a suspicious phone call. Kim does some digging and finds out that Joe is still alive and he withdrew money from Kim's offshore account at an ATM in Monte Carlo. Kim steals Noah's phone and buries it in the woods. Cain goes looking for him and after hearing his phone ring, underneath the soil, he fears that Kim has killed him and begins to dig - only to be caught be the police. Kim then threatens to get Cain imprisoned for Joe's murder if he does not do what she wants. Noah becomes suspicious of Kim and Graham after hearing them talking about Joe. Kim finally tells Cain that Joe is not dead and tries blackmailing him into bed in exchange for her telling the police. Cain chases after Graham and fights him in a field, until his wife Moira Dingle (Natalie J. Robb) intervenes to break up the brawl. Cain agrees to sleep with Kim but bails out at the last minute, enraging Kim. Graham phones Joe to say a final goodbye to him, but as Kim threatens to have him killed, he blackmailed her by saying he will tell Jamie if she does not leave Joe alone. Kim tries to contact Jamie but fails to. Debbie slaps Kim once she learns the truth about Joe. In April, Jamie arrives in Emmerdale to be interviewed for a job at the vet surgery. Later, Kim forms an unlikely friendship with local vet Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) upon requesting her to find an incentive to keep Jamie at the vets. Kim also decides she wants her son living with her at Home Farm and does her best to persuade him to move in. Kim argues with Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox) but later finds out from Jamie that she's terminally ill. Kim suggests sending flowers and a spa voucher, but Jamie disagrees. Kim asks Jamie how she can be better and says she wants to be a proper mother to him but she's out of practice. Kim reveals that all she wants is to spend time with Jamie, with just the two of them and nobody else getting in the way. Jamie tells Kim that nobody forced her to alienate everyone and that she can't change that. Kim tells Jamie she can, and offers Jamie to stay for food and a glass of champagne. Jamie turns down the offer as he has an exam the next day, with Kim offering to help him revise. Jamie refuses and leaves. Some time later, Jamie gives Kim a choice, he will stay at Home Farm but only if she invites Lisa to dinner to make up for being so horrible to her. Kim agrees to do this. In June, whilst Kim is out riding her horse, a car comes speeding around the corner. It slows down to pass Kim, but the horse gets spooked and he bolts, with Kim chasing after him. As Kim walks her horse to the vet, she spots the car that spooked her horse parked outside the vets so she confronts the driver. Jamie notices Kim arguing with the woman, who he recognises as his wife, Andrea (Anna Nightingale) with his daughter Millie (Willow Bell) in the back of the car. Jamie introduces them to his shocked mother, who is at first frosty with them. At Home Farm, Jamie explains to Andrea that he was going to tell her about moving in when he came home. Kim listens to the pair's conversation from the other side of the door and is pleased that they're arguing. She believes Jamie regrets marrying Andrea and that's why he didn't tell anyone about her and Millie although Jamie states he did that as he was protecting his wife and daughter from her. After Jamie has left, Kim reveals to Rhona that Jamie is married with a child and didn't tell her about them. Kim refuses to sit back and let Andrea take her son away from her. Graham later reveals to Kim that he had hired Andrea to keep tabs on Jamie when he was in a bad place and unable to do so himself. But he then lost contact with Andrea, who had genuinely fallen for Jamie after she fell pregnant with Millie. Jamie is blissfully unaware of the arrangement and despite Kim's belief that Andrea is after Jamie's money, Andrea insists that the wealth is of no interest to her, she loves him. In July, Rishi Sharma made a deal with Kim to help save Sharma & Sharma. Realising Kim is his only way out, he reluctantly accepts the offer. During this time, Jamie and Andrea planned to get Kim to sign a contract which cuts her out of a deal. However, Kim found out about their plans through an accidental video call by Millie. With Kim having uncovered Jamie's secret plan to trick her into signing over her share of the vets to him, she was furious and sent Graham over to destroy Rhona's career by coming down hard on the vet surgery. Meanwhile, Kim once again appeared to be having a moment of conscience as Jamie threatened to leave. Determined to keep him in her life, she assured him that he could have her share of the vets. Kim became the co-owner of Sharma & Sharma, buying a 49.5% share, after a fire and explosion when the insurance company refused to pay out, causing the Sharmas to no longer be able to afford to pay for the repairs or wages for the workers. She later convinces Nicola to sell her 1% share to her, giving her the majority control over the business. However, she soon reveals the share was actually bought by her secret business partner, Al Chapman (Michael Wildman. The pair then unveil their plans to build an outdoor pursuit centre at the factory grounds, to a shocked Jai and the horrified factory workers who fear they'll lose their jobs. Graham drops a bombshell on Kim, revealing it was Jamie who called the police on her which resulted in her being convicted in 2013. After Graham revealed he's in a relationship with Rhona, Kim grows upset and jealous. She texts him to come to the pub, were she reveals they are married and it's their anniversary, which left Rhona upset. Graham tells Kim that he is Millie's biological father, not Jamie, after having an affair with Andrea. Kim does a DNA test by getting strands of Millie's hair but Jamie is revealed as her father. Graham crashes the their Christmas Day dinner by revealing to Jamie his affair with Andrea. Graham and Rhona decide to move to France develops feuds with several residents in the village, including Kim. In January, Graham lies to Kim about breaking up with Rhona but when she realises this, she orders Al to kill him, agreeing to pay off his ¬£60,000 debt if he does it. Al finds Graham's body in the woods, realising someone else has murdered him. Kim pays off his debts after lying. However, Kim was struggling to cope with her husband's death. Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) is arrested and imprisoned for Graham's murder. In February, Pierce Harris (Jonathan Wrather), Rhona's rapist ex-husband and Graham's murderer, deliberately cycles out in front of Kim, causing her to run him over. Kim invites Pierce into Home Farm to check him over, completely oblivious to who he is. Posing as a lawyer named Ollie, Kim falls for Pierce's lies and agrees to represent Jamie in his custody battle with Andrea over Millie. After Pierce is spotted by Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick), he kidnaps her and ties her up, revealing she has bowel cancer. He used Vanessa to lure Rhona. However, Kim is knocked out by Pierce and is tied up with Vanessa. Rhona live streams him confessing to Graham's murder and drugs him. Pierce is then arrested by armed police and Kim is freed. Development=Characterisation and portrayal Kim as she appeared in 1989. Kim is an archetypal soap \\"superbitch,\\" a ruthless and scheming gold-digger. In the 2014 Channel 5 documentary TV's Nastiest Villains, King explained that as a big fan of the American soap operas Dallas and Dynasty, she realised that British soap operas did not have a \\"bitch\\" character at the time and intentionally played up Kim's bitchiness. In King's autobiography, \\"Confessions of a Bad Girl', she wrote that Kim was originally going to be married to Chris, but the writers decided that Kim was more interested in the Tate money and would have \\"cut out the middle man\\" by marrying Frank.King, Claire, Confessions of a Bad Girl, John Blake Publishing,  Departure (1999) Speaking about Kim's departure in 1999, series producer Kieran Roberts felt that it would have been wrong to kill off the character as she was the \\"ultimate survivor\\". Roberts added that Kim's escape in a helicopter was fitting and signified her triumph over those around her. Reintroduction (2018) On 24 September 2018, it was confirmed that Claire King had reprised her role as Kim Tate after almost twenty years off-screen. Her return aired as part of a \\"special week\\" of episodes between 8 and 12 October 2018. King noted that she had been asked to return in the past, but felt the timing was right this time around as there was already another Tate in the show following Joe Tate's (Ned Porteous) return in 2017. King knew about Kim's return about a year before it was announced. To keep the return under wraps, King's name was kept secret on call sheets and scripts, and the actress had to enter the set through a back entrance to avoid fans at the front entrance. On 12 October 2018, it was confirmed that Kim would be returning permanently in 2019. Speaking about Kim's return, executive producer Jane Hudson said: \\"Although Kim's initial return was fleeting, she caused such mischief and chaos that we simply couldn't resist bringing her back. Kim Tate is just getting warmed up for an explosive 2019 which will see her hell-bent on getting exactly what, and who, she wants.\\" Kim returned on 14 March 2019. Reception Kim Tate is considered one of Emmerdale's most \\"iconic\\" and \\"notorious\\" characters. According to The Independent, Kim's arrival was a turning point for the show: \\"Suddenly, it was more Dynasty than dales, and Tate threw herself into the role with gusto, cheating on her husband with a younger man, plotting to kill him to inherit his business, etc, etc. The red- top tabloids, used to a diet of EastEnders and Corrie storylines fed to them by the publicists, suddenly woke up to the existence of Emmerdale ‚Äì it helped when King began a relationship with another actor, who played her stepson.\\" Her original departure from the show on 19 January 1999 was watched by nearly 15 million viewers (No permanent link available. Search for relevant dates.) and won Best Exit at the 1999 British Soap Awards. According to Radio Times, Kim \\"basically wrote the book on British soap bitches.\\" The character was featured in the 2001 Channel 4 countdown of the top ten \\"TV Bitches\\" (placing 4th) and the 2014 Channel 5 countdown of \\"TV's Nastiest Villains\\" (placing 15th). She has appeared in various published lists of the top soap opera villains. Kim came in fifth in a 2003 TVTimes poll of the top soap villains of all time, the highest-ranked female on the list. She was also named one of the top ten most evil soap villains by the Daily Mirror in 2009 and came in fourth in a 2016 Digital Spy list of the top ten female soap villains of all time. The character was selected as one of the \\"top 100 British soap characters\\" in a 2012 poll run by What's on TV, with readers also voting on \\"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\\" In anticipation of her return in 2018, Metro wrote: \\"viewers fondly remember soap's biggest superbitch, the woman who killed off her ex husband by merely showing up ‚Äì and applied her lipstick as he drew his last breaths.\\" References ;General ;Specific Emmerdale characters Television characters introduced in 1989 Female characters in television Fictional female businesspeople Fictional criminals on soap operas Fictional blackmailers Fictional fraudsters Female villains Fictional prisoners and detainees Fictional con artists ","title":"Kim Tate"},{"id":"6308279","text":"Singleton is a suburb of Ashford in Kent, South East England, first developed in the 1980s.

Beaconhills was established in 1982 by the Anglican and Uniting Churches to serve the education needs of the Christian community in the greater Pakenham area. The college celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012. College history=Inception The idea to establish a local, independent, Christian school was conceived by a group of parishioners at St. John's Anglican Church in Upper Beaconsfield in 1980. By March 1981 a steering committee had been established with John McConchie appointed as chairperson. The steering committee called a public meeting at the Pakenham Hall on 11 March 1981 where the proposal to establish an ecumenical, co-educational, low-fee secondary school was ratified in the presence of some 250 people. In 1981, as the steering committee continued to hold public meetings seeking support for the new school, a site on Toomuc Valley Road, Pakenham was purchased and portable classrooms obtained from St. Catherine's School in Toorak, and Frank Millett was appointed as founding principal. On 3 February 1982 Beaconhills Christian College opened with 34 students and five staff. A dedication service was held at St. James Church on 28 March 1982. Frank Millet led the college as principal until 1988, by which time the college community had grown to include 388 students and a teaching staff of 30.

Rogers High School is located in west Toledo, Ohio, United States. It has been part of Toledo Public Schools since 1964, when Adams Township was annexed by the city. The school motto is \\"Writing success stories... one student at a time.\\" As of 2008, with the exception of 2012-13, the school principal is Kelly Welch. History of Rogers High School In 1938, Toledo native Robert S. Rogers was elected to the Adams Township School Board. Frustrated by the fact that the township's teens were forced to attend high school in neighboring districts, Rogers advocated construction of a township high school ‚Äì not just for the sake of convenience, but to create community in the township. Rogers died in 1944, but his dream came to fruition in 1956 when 500 students walked into the school named after him at the corner of Nebraska Ave. and McTigue Drive. At the time, it was everything educators, students, and families could want for their suburban, nearly rural, community. Rogers High indeed provided a common identity for the Adams Township community ‚Äì to the point where Joseph's Supermarket donated a rambunctious live ram (\\"Bunky\\") as the school's mascot! What Rogers couldn‚Äôt have dreamed was the growth of the neighborhoods flanking Reynolds Road as Toledo's economy boomed after World War II. By 1964, Adams Township entered into an annexation agreement with the City of Toledo, and in 1966 Rogers High School was reborn as a Toledo Public School ‚Äì complete with a million dollar expansion that included the city's only high school planetarium, a spacious library, cafeteria, and a gargantuan West Gymnasium that was the envy of the City League. As the children of the post-war Baby Boom grew, so did Rogers High School. By the 1970s, Rogers had adopted a split schedule to accommodate some 2,400 students. In 1976, the building was expanded a third time with the state-of-the-art Rogers Skills Center added onto the front of the building. In 1980, the school absorbed the majority of the students of the former Spencer-Sharples High School several miles to the west after numerous attempts to merge the Spencer- Sharples Local School District with neighboring, predominantly white, districts failed. This was a pattern that in 1975, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare would say violated U.S. civil rights laws and created a segregated district. Rogers also absorbed a fair amount of DeVilbiss and Macomber students in 1991 when TPS closed both of those buildings. Demolition of the old Rogers High School began in October 2007 and finished in February 2008. The new Rogers High School (built as part of Toledo Public Schools' \\"Building for Success\\" program) opened in 2006-2007 on McTigue Drive (while the new McTigue Middle School near Rogers opened on Nebraska Drive in September 2007).

Qualitatively, it corresponds to a potential which is zero everywhere, except at a single point, where it takes an infinite value. This can be used to simulate situations where a particle is free to move in two regions of space with a barrier between the two regions. For example, an electron can move almost freely in a conducting material, but if two conducting surfaces are put close together, the interface between them acts as a barrier for the electron that can be approximated by a delta potential. The delta potential well is a limiting case of the finite potential well, which is obtained if one maintains the product of the width of the well and the potential constant while decreasing the well's width and increasing the potential. This article, for simplicity, only considers a one-dimensional potential well, but analysis could be expanded to more dimensions.  Single delta potential  right The time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for the wave function of a particle in one dimension in a potential is :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\psi}{dx^2}(x) +V(x)\\\\psi(x) = E\\\\psi(x) ~, where is the reduced Planck constant and is the energy of the particle. The delta potential is the potential :\\\\displaystyle V(x) = \\\\lambda\\\\delta(x) ~, where is the Dirac delta function. It is called a delta potential well if is negative and a delta potential barrier if is positive. The delta has been defined to occur at the origin for simplicity; a shift in the delta function's argument does not change any of the proceeding results.  Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation  The potential splits the space in two parts ( < 0 and > 0). In each of these parts the potential energy is zero, and the Schr√∂dinger equation reduces to : \\\\frac{d^2\\\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\\\frac{2mE}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\psi ~; this is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients whose solutions are linear combinations of and , where the wave number is related to the energy by :k=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\\\hbar} ~. In general, due to the presence of the delta potential in the origin, the coefficients of the solution need not be the same in both half-spaces: :\\\\psi(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm L}(x) = A_{\\\\mathrm r}e^{ikx} + A_{\\\\mathrm l}e^{-ikx}, & \\\\text{ if } x<0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{\\\\mathrm R}(x) = B_{\\\\mathrm r}e^{ikx} + B_{\\\\mathrm l}e^{-ikx}, & \\\\text{ if } x>0, \\\\end{cases} where, in the case of positive energies (real ), represents a wave traveling to the right, and one traveling to the left. One obtains a relation between the coefficients by imposing that the wavefunction be continuous at the origin, :\\\\psi(0) = \\\\psi_L(0) = \\\\psi_R(0) = A_r + A_l = B_r + B_l ~, A second relation can be found by studying the derivative of the wavefunction. Normally, we could also impose differentiability at the origin, but this is not possible because of the delta potential. However, if we integrate the Schr√∂dinger equation around = 0, over an interval [‚àíŒµ, +Œµ]: : -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\\\int_{-\\\\epsilon}^{+\\\\epsilon} \\\\psi(x) \\\\,dx + \\\\int_{-\\\\epsilon}^{+\\\\epsilon} V(x)\\\\psi(x) \\\\,dx = E \\\\int_{-\\\\epsilon}^{+\\\\epsilon} \\\\psi(x) \\\\,dx. In the limit as Œµ ‚Üí 0, the right-hand side of this equation vanishes; the left-hand side becomes :\\\\textstyle -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} [ \\\\psi ' _R (0) - \\\\psi ' _L (0) ] + \\\\lambda \\\\psi (0) , because :\\\\int_{-\\\\epsilon}^{+\\\\epsilon} \\\\psi(x) \\\\,dx = [\\\\psi'({+\\\\epsilon}) - \\\\psi'({-\\\\epsilon})] . Substituting the definition of into this expression, yields :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}ik (-A_r + A_l + B_r - B_l) + \\\\lambda(A_r + A_l) = 0~. The boundary conditions thus give the following restrictions on the coefficients :\\\\begin{cases} A_r + A_l - B_r - B_l &= 0;\\\\\\\\\\\\ -A_r + A_l + B_r - B_l &= \\\\frac{2m\\\\lambda}{ik\\\\hbar^2}(A_r + A_l)~. \\\\end{cases}  Bound state (E < 0)  The graph of the bound state wavefunction solution to the delta function potential is continuous everywhere, but its derivative is not defined at x=0. In any one-dimensional attractive potential there will be a bound state. To find its energy, note that for < 0, = = is imaginary and the wave functions which were oscillating for positive energies in the calculation above, are now exponentially increasing or decreasing functions of x (see above). Requiring that the wave functions do not diverge at infinity eliminates half of the terms: = = 0\\\\. The wave function is then :\\\\psi(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\psi_{\\\\text{L}}(x) = A_{l}e^{\\\\kappa x}, & \\\\text{ if } x<0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{\\\\text{R}}(x) = B_{r}e^{-\\\\kappa x}, & \\\\text{ if } x>0. \\\\end{cases} From the boundary conditions and normalization conditions, it follows that :\\\\begin{cases} A_l = B_r = \\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa};\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\kappa = -\\\\frac{m \\\\lambda}{\\\\hbar^2}~; \\\\end{cases} from which it follows that must be negative, that is the bound state only exists for the well, and not for the barrier. The Fourier transform of this wave function is a Lorentzian function. The energy of the bound state is then :E=-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2\\\\kappa^2}{2m}=-\\\\frac{m\\\\lambda^2}{2\\\\hbar^2}.  Scattering (E > 0)  Transmission (T) and reflection (R) probability of a delta potential well. The energy >0 is in units of \\\\frac{m\\\\lambda^2}{2\\\\hbar^2}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Dashed: classical result. Solid line: quantum mechanics. For positive energies, the particle is free to move in either half-space: < 0 or > 0\\\\. It may be scattered at the delta function potential. The quantum case can be studied in the following situation: a particle incident on the barrier from the left side . It may be reflected or transmitted . To find the amplitudes for reflection and transmission for incidence from the left, we put in the above equations = 1 (incoming particle), = (reflection), = 0 (no incoming particle from the right) and = (transmission), and solve for and even though we do not have any equations in .

Due to the mirror symmetry of the model, the amplitudes for incidence from the right are the same as those from the left. The result is that there is a non-zero probability :R=r^2=\\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{\\\\hbar^4k^2}{m^2\\\\lambda^2}}= \\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{2\\\\hbar^2 E}{m\\\\lambda^2}}.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for the particle to be reflected. This does not depend on the sign of , that is, a barrier has the same probability of reflecting the particle as a well. This is a significant difference from classical mechanics, where the reflection probability would be 1 for the barrier (the particle simply bounces back), and 0 for the well (the particle passes through the well undisturbed). In summary, the probability for transmission is :T=t^2=1-R=\\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{m^2\\\\lambda^2}{\\\\hbar^4k^2}}= \\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{m \\\\lambda^2}{2\\\\hbar^2 E}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!.  Remarks and application  The calculation presented above may at first seem unrealistic and hardly useful. However, it has proved to be a suitable model for a variety of real- life systems. One such example regards the interfaces between two conducting materials. In the bulk of the materials, the motion of the electrons is quasi- free and can be described by the kinetic term in the above Hamiltonian with an effective mass . Often, the surfaces of such materials are covered with oxide layers or are not ideal for other reasons. This thin, non-conducting layer may then be modeled by a local delta-function potential as above. Electrons may then tunnel from one material to the other giving rise to a current. The operation of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) relies on this tunneling effect. In that case, the barrier is due to the air between the tip of the STM and the underlying object. The strength of the barrier is related to the separation being stronger the further apart the two are. For a more general model of this situation, see Finite potential barrier (QM). The delta function potential barrier is the limiting case of the model considered there for very high and narrow barriers. The above model is one-dimensional while the space around us is three-dimensional. So, in fact, one should solve the Schr√∂dinger equation in three dimensions. On the other hand, many systems only change along one coordinate direction and are translationally invariant along the others. The Schr√∂dinger equation may then be reduced to the case considered here by an Ansatz for the wave function of the type \\\\Psi(x,y,z)=\\\\psi(x)\\\\phi(y,z)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Alternatively, it is possible to generalize the delta function to exist on the surface of some domain D (see Laplacian of the indicator). The delta function model is actually a one-dimensional version of the Hydrogen atom according to the dimensional scaling method developed by the group of Dudley R. HerschbachD.R. Herschbach, J.S. Avery, and O. Goscinski (eds.), Dimensional Scaling in Chemical Physics, Springer, (1992). The delta function model becomes particularly useful with the double-well Dirac Delta function model which represents a one-dimensional version of the Hydrogen molecule ion, as shown in the following section.  Double delta potential  The symmetric and anti-symmetric wavefunctions for the double-well Dirac delta function model with \\"internuclear\\" distance R=2. The double-well Dirac delta function models a diatomic hydrogen molecule by the corresponding Schr√∂dinger equation: :-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\psi}{dx^2}(x) +V(x)\\\\psi(x) = E\\\\psi(x) where the potential is now: :V(x)=-q \\\\left[ \\\\delta \\\\left(x + \\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right) + \\\\lambda\\\\delta \\\\left(x- \\\\frac{R}{2} \\\\right) \\\\right] where 0 < R < \\\\infty is the \\"internuclear\\" distance with Dirac delta function (negative) peaks located at =¬±/2 (shown in brown in the diagram). Keeping in mind the relationship of this model with its three-dimensional molecular counterpart, we use atomic units and set \\\\hbar = m=1. Here 0 < \\\\lambda < 1 is a formally adjustable parameter. From the single well case, we can infer the \\"ansatz\\" for the solution to be: : \\\\psi (x) ~ = ~ A e^{-d \\\\leftx + \\\\frac{R}{2}\\\\right} + B e^{-d \\\\leftx - \\\\frac{R}{2} \\\\right} Matching of the wavefunction at the Dirac delta function peaks yields the determinant: : \\\\left \\\\begin{array}{cc} q - d & q e^{-d R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ q \\\\lambda e^{-d R} & q \\\\lambda - d \\\\end{array} \\\\right = 0 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where} \\\\quad E = -\\\\frac{d^2}{2} ~. Thus, d is found to be governed by the pseudo-quadratic equation: : d_{\\\\pm} (\\\\lambda )~=~{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{2}}q (\\\\lambda+1) \\\\pm {\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ q^2 (1+\\\\lambda )^{2}-4\\\\,\\\\lambda q^2 \\\\lbrack 1-e^{-2d_{\\\\pm }(\\\\lambda )R}]\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ^{1/2} which has two solutions d=d_{\\\\pm} . For the case of equal charges (symmetric homonuclear case), =1 and the pseudo-quadratic reduces to: : d_{\\\\pm} = q [1 \\\\pm e^{-d_{\\\\pm} R}] The \\"+\\" case corresponds to a wave function symmetric about the midpoint (shown in red in the diagram) where = and is called gerade. Correspondingly, the \\"-\\" case is the wave function that is anti-symmetric about the midpoint where = ‚Äì is called ungerade (shown in green in the diagram). They represent an approximation of the two lowest discrete energy states of the three-dimensional H_2^{+} and are useful in its analysis. Analytical solutions for the energy eigenvalues for the case of symmetric charges are given by: T.C. Scott, J.F. Babb, A. Dalgarno and John D. Morgan III, \\"The Calculation of Exchange Forces: General Results and Specific Models\\", J. Chem. Phys., 99, pp. 2841-2854, (1993). : d_{\\\\pm} = q ~+~ W (\\\\pm q R e^{-q R} )/R where W is the standard Lambert W function. Note that the lowest energy corresponds to the symmetric solution d_+. In the case of unequal charges, and for that matter the three-dimensional molecular problem, the solutions are given by a generalization of the Lambert W function (see section on generalization of Lambert W function and references herein). One of the most interesting cases is when qR ‚â§ 1, which results in d_{-}=0 . Thus, one has a non-trivial bound state solution with =0. For these specific parameters, there are many interesting properties that occur, one of which is the unusual effect that the transmission coefficient is unity at zero energy. W. van Dijk and K. A.

The leaves are deciduous and the flowers are light greenish-yellow, with the stamens turning red with age. The fruit, closely resembling that of the avocado, is generally pear-shaped, with a thick, green, leathery skin. The flesh is oily with a milky juice and tastes like an avocado or coconut. The pear-shaped fruit is easily mistaken for an avocado. However, it contains a much larger central seed. The flesh has stone cells and a gritty texture that is generally considered unfavourable for edible consumption, despite its appealing taste.

It was developed by Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr., a 45-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, in the 1970s for use by the Agency. ACH is used by analysts in various fields who make judgments that entail a high risk of error in reasoning. ACH aims to help an analyst overcome, or at least minimize, some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient intelligence analysis so difficult to achieve. ACH was a step forward in intelligence analysis methodology, but it was first described in relatively informal terms. Producing the best available information from uncertain data remains the goal of researchers, tool-builders, and analysts in industry, academia and government. Their domains include data mining, cognitive psychology and visualization, probability and statistics, etc. Abductive reasoning is an earlier concept with similarities to ACH. Process Heuer outlines the ACH process in considerable depth in his book, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis. It consists of the following steps: # Hypothesis ‚Äì The first step of the process is to identify all potential hypotheses, preferably using a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities. The process discourages the analyst from choosing one \\"likely\\" hypothesis and using evidence to prove its accuracy. Cognitive bias is minimized when all possible hypotheses are considered. # Evidence ‚Äì The analyst then lists evidence and arguments (including assumptions and logical deductions) for and against each hypothesis. # Diagnostics ‚Äì Using a matrix, the analyst applies evidence against each hypothesis in an attempt to disprove as many theories as possible. Some evidence will have greater \\"diagnosticity\\" than other evidence ‚Äî that is, some will be more helpful in judging the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This step is the most important, according to Heuer. Instead of looking at one hypothesis and all the evidence (\\"working down\\" the matrix), the analyst is encouraged to consider one piece of evidence at a time, and examine it against all possible hypotheses (\\"working across\\" the matrix). # Refinement ‚Äì The analyst reviews the findings, identifies any gaps, and collects any additional evidence needed to refute as many of the remaining hypotheses as possible. # Inconsistency ‚Äì The analyst then seeks to draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Less consistency implies a lower likelihood. The least consistent hypotheses are eliminated. While the matrix generates a definitive mathematical total for each hypothesis, the analyst must use their judgment to make the final conclusion. The result of the ACH analysis itself must not overrule analysts' own judgments. # Sensitivity ‚Äì The analyst tests the conclusions using sensitivity analysis, which weighs how the conclusion would be affected if key evidence or arguments were wrong, misleading, or subject to different interpretations. The validity of key evidence and the consistency of important arguments are double-checked to assure the soundness of the conclusion's linchpins and drivers. # Conclusions and evaluation ‚Äì Finally, the analyst provides the decisionmaker with his or her conclusions, as well as a summary of alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected. The analyst also identifies milestones in the process that can serve as indicators in future analyses. Strengths There are many benefits of doing an ACH matrix. It is auditable. It is widely believed to help overcome cognitive biases, though there is a lack of strong empirical evidence to support this belief. Since the ACH requires the analyst to construct a matrix, the evidence and hypotheses can be backtracked. This allows the decisionmaker or other analysts to see the sequence of rules and data that led to the conclusion. Weaknesses The process to create an ACH is time consuming. The ACH matrix can be problematic when analyzing a complex project. It can be cumbersome for an analyst to manage a large database with multiple pieces of evidence. Especially in intelligence, both governmental and business, analysts must always be aware that the opponent(s) is intelligent and may be generating information intended to deceive. MITRE Sponsored Research Project 51MSR111, Counter-Deception Decision Support Since deception often is the result of a cognitive trap, Elsaesser and Stech use state-based hierarchical plan recognition (see abductive reasoning) to generate causal explanations of observations. The resulting hypotheses are converted to a dynamic Bayesian network and value of information analysis is employed to isolate assumptions implicit in the evaluation of paths in, or conclusions of, particular hypotheses. As evidence in the form of observations of states or assumptions is observed, they can become the subject of separate validation. Should an assumption or necessary state be negated, hypotheses depending on it are rejected. This is a form of root cause analysis. Evidence also presents a problem if it is unreliable. The evidence used in the matrix is static and therefore it can be a snapshot in time. According to social constructivist critics, ACH also fails to stress sufficiently (or to address as a method) the problematic nature of the initial formation of the hypotheses used to create its grid. There is considerable evidence, for example, that in addition to any bureaucratic, psychological, or political biases that may affect hypothesis generation, there are also factors of culture and identity at work. These socially constructed factors may restrict or pre-screen which hypotheses end up being considered, and then reinforce confirmation bias in those selected.Chapters one to four, Philosopher and argumentation theorist Tim van Gelder has made the following criticisms: * ACH demands that the analyst makes too many discrete judgments, a great many of which contribute little if anything to discerning the best hypothesis * ACH misconceives the nature of the relationship between items of evidence and hypotheses by supposing that items of evidence are, on their own, consistent or inconsistent with hypotheses. * ACH treats the hypothesis set as \\"flat\\", i.e. a mere list, and so is unable to relate evidence to hypotheses at the appropriate levels of abstraction * ACH cannot represent subordinate argumentation, i.e. the argumentation bearing up on a piece of evidence. * ACH activities at realistic scales leave analysts disoriented or confused. Van Gelder proposed hypothesis mapping (similar to argument mapping) as an alternative to ACH. Structured analysis of competing hypotheses The structured analysis of competing hypotheses offers analysts an improvement over the limitations of the original ACH. The SACH maximizes the possible hypotheses by allowing the analyst to split one hypothesis into two complex ones. For example, two tested hypotheses could be that Iraq has WMD or Iraq does not have WMD. If the evidence showed that it is more likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be that Iraq has biological WMD, Iraq has chemical WMD and Iraq has nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate. Other approaches to formalism One method, by Valtorta and colleagues uses probabilistic methods, adds Bayesian analysis to ACH. A generalization of this concept to a distributed community of analysts lead to the development of CACHE (the Collaborative ACH Environment),Shrager, J., et al. (2009) Soccer science and the Bayes community: Exploring the cognitive implications of modern scientific communication. Topics in Cognitive Science, 2(1), 53‚Äì72. which introduced the concept of a Bayes (or Bayesian) community. The work by Akram and Wang applies paradigms from graph theory. Other work focuses less on probabilistic methods and more on cognitive and visualization extensions to ACH, as discussed by Madsen and Hicks. DECIDE, discussed under automation is visualization-oriented. Work by Pope and J√∏sang uses subjective logic, a formal mathematical methodology that explicitly deals with uncertainty. This methodology forms the basis of the Sheba technology that is used in Veriluma's intelligence assessment software. Automation A few online and downloadable tools help automate the ACH process. These programs leave a visual trail of evidence and allow the analyst to weigh evidence. PARC ACH 2.0 was developed by Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in collaboration with Richards J. Heuer, Jr. It is a standard ACH program that allows analysts to enter evidence and rate its credibility and relevance. Another useful program is the Decision Command software created by Dr. Willard Zangwill. SSS Research, Inc. is an analytic research firm that created DECIDE. DECIDE not only allows analysts to manipulate ACH, but it provides multiple visualization products. There is at least one open-source ACH implementation.

Tommaso Laureti, often called Tommaso Laureti Siciliano (c. 1530 ‚Äî 22 September 1602),G. Baglione, ' (Rome) 1642: was an Italian painter from Sicily who trained in the atelier of the aged Sebastiano del Piombo and worked in Bologna. From 1582, he worked for papal patrons in Rome in a Michelangelo- inspired style with special skill in illusionistic perspective, that in his Roman work avoided all but traces of Mannerism.Freedberg 1993: page 654. Biography Laureti was born in Palermo, Sicily. After his first master's death in 1547, he settled in Bologna, introducing illusionistic perspective paintings on ceilings to the city, notably an Alexander the Great ceiling with a painted architectural setting in Palazzo Vizzani.An engraved detail is dated 1562, according to Ebria Feinblatt, \\"Contributions to Girolamo Curti\\" The Burlington Magazine, 117 No. 867 (June 1975, pp. 342+344-353) p. 349. He painted a Transportation of the Body of Saint Augustine for the church of San Giacomo Maggiore in Bologna. The Mannerist structural elements of the marble and bronze Fountain of Neptune in Bologna, which is surmounted by Giambologna's Neptune, completed in 1566, were based on a 1563 drawing by Laureti. This commission from Pope Pius IV is undoubtedly Laureti's most familiar public work (illustration, left below). In the church of Santa Susanna in Rome, Laureti's Death of Saint Susanna the main altarpiece in the church. His frescoes in the Sala dei Capitani in Michelangelo's Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Campidoglio, painted in 1587-94, depict episodes from Ancient Roman republic: The Justice of Brutus; Horatius Cocles defending the Pons Sublicius; Victory at Lake Regillus; and Mucius Scaevola before Lars Porsena. Laureti designed the base with its figures for Giambologna's Neptune Fountain, Bologna. In 1582, the administration of Pope Gregory XIII commissioned Laureti to execute a series of frescoes on a post-Council of Trent triumphalist theme, The Triumph of the Christian religion on the newly vaulted ceiling of the Sala di Costantino or Hall of Constantine, where the walls had been frescoed by the school of Raphael earlier in the century. The central theme is surrounded by allegorical female figures representing the Italian provinces. The ceiling was completed under the pontificate of Sixtus V, who had grown discontent with the dilatory performance of Laureti. The rigorous illusionistic perspectives represent the painter's constant fascination with the art of perspective. Baglione in his biographies of artists states Laureti was assisted by the painter Antonio Scalvati.Patrons of the Arts in the Vatican Museums , webpage on Hall of Constantine. Vignola's Due regole..., 1583 Laureti's perspective design for a portion of an illusionistic ceiling, seen as di sotto in su or 'from below to above', was engraved for Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola's, Le due regole della prospettiva pratica., 1583 (illustration, right).An example was included in the Getty Museum exhibition \\"The Geometry of Seeing\\", 2002. For the Basilica of San Prospero in Reggio Emilia, he painted an altarpiece depicting the Assumption; this painting was completed by Ludovico Carracci in 1602. Laureti was the second principe or director of the Accademia di San Luca or the artists' academy in Rome, succeeding Federico Zuccari in 1595. His commemorative portrait (dated 1603) by Orazio Borgianni is still on display in the Accademia di San Luca.Harold E.

According to the Nihon-Shoki, the Emperor Tenmu had a map of the area made in 684 AD and a temporary building built the following year. Togakushi shrine was a pilgrimage site during the following eight centuries. Its name was ranked with the Ise-jingu Shrine, Koya-san Temple and Enryaku-ji temples. Togakushisan Kansyuin Kenkou-ji was the formal name of the Togakushi Temple. Two major esoteric Buddhist sects, Shingon and Tendai fought for the hegemony of Togakushi Temple. Eventually the Shingon sect lost the battle. Togakushi Temple was changed to a shrine by the Meiji government's Buddhism/Shinto separation initiatives \\"Shinbutsu bunri\\", \\"Haibutsu kishaku\\", and the 1868 Temple Ordinance. Until that time, it was common in Japan for the same buildings to be used as both temples (Buddhist) and shrines (Shinto). Until the 19th century, Buddhist activities at the Togakushi Temple were dedicated to \\"Avalokite≈õvara\\".  Site  Upon arrival at Togakushi it is recommended to first visit Oku-sha and then Kuzuryu-sha. It is a 2 kilometer hike from the entrance to the two shrines, however the path leading deep into the mountain can only be taken on foot.

The tree canopy is dominated by sugar maple or black maple. Other tree species, if present, form only a small fraction of the total tree cover. In the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia, and in some New England states, many sugar bushes have a sugar shack where maple syrup can be bought or sampled. After tapping (circa 1902) The maples are tapped for their maple sap in early spring, whenever the weather has warmed so that day-time temperatures are above freezing -- -- while night-time temperatures remain below freezing. The tapping period ends when the supply of maple sap ceases, as when night-time temperatures begin to be above freezing, or when the tree produces metabolites to facilitate tree bud development (which will give syrup an off flavor)--whichever comes first. After the tapping period, some maple sugar bushes experience a profusion of spring wildflowers which take advantage of unobstructed sunlight before the maple leaves emerge. In summer, a healthy maple sugar bush is luxuriant and shady. Autumn leaves are colorful, especially on the sugar maples.

It is a part of the Lewisville Independent School District located in southeastern Denton County. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  History  The Colony High School, located in The Colony, which opened in 1986 is part of Lewisville ISD. Seniors of the 1987 class attended Lewisville High School as TCHS initially had only grades 9‚Äì11.  Academics  The Colony High School offers a standard Texas high school curriculum as defined by the Texas State graduation requirements. In addition to those minimum requirements, The Colony High School also offers numerous College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses that gives students the opportunity to qualify for college credit. Also a new addition to The Colony High School's academic help for the students is a program nationally known as AVID; Advancement Via Individual Determination which is a class for students who want to get into college. The class teaches them ways to take college level notes, self-discipline necessary for getting work done in college while giving them the opportunity to meet professionals in the field and allowing the students to go on field trips to college campuses. TCHS was the first high school in LISD to have the AVID program under the initial instruction of Jennifer Adams, Coach Dietzman, and this year's AVID teacher for the juniors and seniors; Reesa Wilkins. Recently, all LISD schools, including The Colony High School, entered into a partnership with local community colleges to offer students dual-credit summer courses that, if passed, qualifies as credit for both high school graduation and college. In 2008/09 a new band hall, drum room, color guard room, and practice rooms were added.  Athletics  The Colony Cougars compete in these sports:The Athletics Department Volleyball, Cross Country, Football, Basketball, Powerlifting, Wrestling, Swimming, Soccer, Golf, Tennis, Track, Cheerleading, Dance, Baseball & Softball State titles *Girls Soccer UIL Girls Soccer Archives **2007(4A) *Theatre - UIL One Act Play State Champions **2015 - \\"The Lost Boy\\" **2016 - 2nd Place - \\"In The Hands of its Enemy\\" **2017 - \\"Second Samuel\\" *Softball **2017(5A) Extracurricular activities The Colony High School has since become one of the premier high schools in the district. Its fine arts program has received numerous awards on a national level. The Colony is home to the renowned 350 piece TCHS Marching Band that participated in the 1997 Tournament of Roses Parade and directed by Dick Clardy. The Colony Marching Band has additionally been a finalist in the Texas State UIL Marching Contest in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 2000. The Colony High School Wind Symphony was named the TMEA Class 5A Honor Band in 1997 and performed at the Midwest International Band Clinic in Chicago in 1994 and 1998, the American Bandmasters Association Convention in 2000, and at Carnegie Hall in 2001. The Colony Band has placed over 100 wind and percussion students in the TMEA All-State Band and Orchestra since 1986. Former band directors at The Colony include, but are not limited to: Dr. Stephen White, Gavin Vitter, Mikel Burress, Lance Flisowski, Mary Ann French, John Peterson, Jason Brents, Luis Saldana, and Courtney Melton. The current directors are Michael Larkin, Jeff Bridges, James Hopkins, and Ian Pilley. Recently, The Colony Marching Band has just made a reappearance at the State UIL Marching Contest in 2017, a first for the school in a few years. The students in the band all perform in two fall concerts: the first premiering their marching show music to the general public in August and the second held right before winter break in December to showcase what the students have been working on since the end of marching season in early November. After winter break, the students come back to start working on their UIL programs and Solo and Ensemble Music. The students participate in the LISD Solo and Ensemble Contest with the option to also play in the UIL Region Solo and Ensemble Contest. The Solo and Ensemble Contests are the only time in the year where the students are free to collaborate on their own to shape their music. During the spring semester, the students play in three more concerts, the Mid-Winter Concert, placed right before the TMEA Convention to showcase the band music that the students' have been working on since winter break; the Pre-UIL Concert, placed before UIL to give the students a taste of how the contest will work and the parents a hearing of the music the students will play at the contest; and the Spring Concert, placed near the end of the school year to give the students one last time to showcase their skills before the summer. The Colony is also home to only Full Orchestra program in LISD. The varsity Full Orchestra at The Colony has consistently earned 1's at the Texas State UIL Concert and Sight-Reading Contests. The members in the orchestra program typically participate in the LISD Solo and Ensemble contest while also hosting their own Small Ensemble Showcase once each spring. Towards the end of the school year, the orchestra usually takes a trip to either participate in a music festival or play at a different location. Currently, the orchestra has only one faculty position, while the school employing private lesson teachers to assist with one-on-one lessons. The JROTC has received numerous rewards. Even the cheerleaders and drill team, known as the Topcats, have won national titles, even though they are recognized as activity groups instead of sports teams. As far as the evolution of the students, they are far beyond their years. They have Topdogs who help the Topcats with their equipment and even male cheerleaders, which is typically not seen until the college years. Physically, the school continues to evolve as well. A new gym was added in 2004, which combined with the two existing gyms to provide the students with state-of-the-art recreational environments. Additionally, a college level weight room dubbed the \\"Powerhouse\\" was built and furnished with a black-and- gold weight set and steel bars (matching the school colors). The Colony continues to send students into THSPA state finals each year led by strength coach Kevin Kallus, and is arguably has the hardest working group of athletes in the state of Texas. Head Coach and Athletic Coordinator Rudy Rangel is a good coach who has led the team 2:1 ratio this 2010 year. In 2009 led by 3 future Division-I college basketball players in Jordan Williams, Austin Chatman, and A.J. Price.

Latest being, champion: Blake Mouser, and sou-champion: Ulises Saldivar, who went on to wrestle in NCWA for Texas State University. The Colony High School also has a very prestigious baseball association. The head coach of the baseball team is Martain Dean, along with his son Matt Dean, who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011. The colony high school has had many achievements with the sports teams it has, but the boys/girls soccer program is one that has stood out in recent years. In the 2007/2008 school year both boys and girls varsity soccer went far into their playoffs run. The boys team led by Jason Guehler, Alex Akwari, Gerardo Espinoza, and Danny Hines and coached by Bailey and Platt Went to their 4A state semi-finals, losing to Brenham 2-0, but regardless of the loss the boys came home welcomed and congratulated by their school for setting a record in their high school, reaching the farthest in playoffs it's reached to date. In 2007 the girls varsity team Coached by Ms. Jund, made it all the way to the state final and won, beating Friendswood 1-0, claiming and bringing home the State 4A title. Since then, every year the girls varsity has managed to make it to playoffs, but, hasn't reached the success it did in the 07 school year. Although the boys soccer had taken a toll in its varsity program, not winning any trophies or even making playoffs in the last five years, broke the streak in the 11/12 school season. The boys team led by seniors Jordan Doak, Kevin Lopez, David Salazar, Kevin Decoud, Alberto Gutierrez, goalkeeper Joshua Guerra and coached by Lee Weddall managed to break the streak by winning three games and tying one resulting in their Berkner ice bowl XXI tournament championship. The cougar football team has been outdone in all the years prior to their 2013 season. This season they've become able to be 8‚Äì0 and undefeated unlike last which only had half the wins as this year.

The purpose, according to the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is to strengthen border security and facilitate entry into the United States for both legitimate U.S. citizens and foreign visitors. The initiative is an outcome of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which was approved after the September 11th, 2001 al Qaeda mass-terror attacks on the U.S. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative was also implemented to deter or prevent the use of forged documents, both for terror and criminal purposes. Implementation The following documents are acceptable for border crossings for most travelers:Homeland Security and State Departments Announce WHTI Land and Sea Final Rule, retrieved April 2, 2008. *U.S. citizens and nationals: **U.S. passport **Passport card **State enhanced driver's license (available in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington) approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security **Trusted traveler program card (Global Entry, NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI) **A valid Merchant Mariner Document when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business **A valid U.S. military identification card when traveling on official orders **The final rule also outlines ongoing efforts to provide other alternative documents. *U.S. lawful permanent residents: Lawful Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551). *Canadian citizens: **A valid Canadian passport **Provincial enhanced driver's license (available in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec) **A valid trusted traveler program card (FAST or NEXUS). *Bermudian permanent residents: A British Overseas Territories passport with valid Bermudian belonger status. *Mexican nationals: **A valid Mexican passport and a visa **A valid Form DSP-150, B-1/B-2 laser visa (also called a Border Crossing Card, or BCC) **A valid SENTRI card may be used for access to expedited border crossing lanes US or Canadian citizen children under age 16 (or, when traveling as part of certain groups, under age 19) can also use other documents as identification, including a birth certificate, for land and sea border crossings. Native Americans in the United States, Mexico, and Canada may be able to use certain additional forms of identification (in addition to the documents valid for citizens of those countries): *Members of the Kickapoo Band of Texas and Tribe of Oklahoma will continue to be able to use the I-872 American Indian Card (provided that it identifies them as Kickapoo), regardless of U.S. or Mexican citizenship. *Members of other U.S. tribes may use an \\"Enhanced Tribal Card\\", when available and approved by DHS. *Members of Canadian tribes may be allowed to use the proposed Secure Certificate of Indian Status already designed and approved by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, waiting for DHS approval. In addition to the other documents designated under WHTI, U.S. citizens on round-trip cruise-ship voyages that begin and end at the same port of entry in the United States may also carry a government-issued photo ID and birth certificate, Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or Certificate of Naturalization. Foreign nationals need a WHTI-designated document to travel to the United States on a cruise ship.  History  Beginning on January 23, 2007, all persons (including U.S. citizens) traveling by air to the United States from all foreign countries (including Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda) are required to present a valid passport, NEXUS card, or U.S. Coast Guard/Merchant Mariner Document.

The celebration features traditional costumed dancing by gender- separated groups. It includes parades of indigenous walking bands, native food, and statewide artisanal crafts, such as Pre-Hispanic-style textiles. Each costume, or traje, and dance usually has a local indigenous historical and cultural meaning. While the celebration has attracted an increasing number of tourists, it is primarily one of deep cultural importance for the indigenous peoples of the state and is important for the survival of these cultures. Background Oaxaca has a large native indigenous population, well over 50 percent of the state, compared to 20 percent for Mexico as a whole (depending on systems of classification). Indigenous culture in Oaxaca remains strong. More than 300,000 people are monolingual in one of a wide variety of native indigenous languages, and many others are bilingual, with Spanish as their second language, or follow a predominantly indigenous lifestyle. Unlike Yucat√°n, another Southeast Mexican state, where the indigenous culture consists of closely related groups of the same culture (Mayan), the indigenous people in Oaxaca are from many different cultures. The Zapotec and Mixtec are the two largest ethnic groups in terms of population and area, but there are numerous other indigenous ethnicities, each with their own unique traditions. They speak distinct, mutually unintelligible languages. The Guelaguetza celebration was a tradition that long preceded the arrival of the Spanish; it is a defining characteristic of Oaxacan regional culture. Its origins and traditions developed as earth-based, religious celebrations related to the worship of corn (maize) and the corn god. The word Guelaguetza comes from the Zapotec language and is usually interpreted as the \\"reciprocal exchanges of gifts and services.\\" This is in keeping with the importance in indigenous cultures of sharing, reciprocity, and extended community. Crowds at Guelaguetza 2005. Like many indigenous traditions in Mexico, the festival adapted to and absorbed Christian traditions in the centuries of cultural interchange after Spanish colonization. The human sacrifice of a virgin slave girl was eliminated. History The Guelaguetza gradually was known as a celebration honoring Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Virgen del Carmen), which emphasized Marianism, combined with the surviving beliefs. In the early part of the 20th century, a severe earthquake in the 1920s destroyed most of the city. Afterward, leaders reorganized the festival as a statewide cultural event to help rebuild the morale of the peoples of Oaxaca, naming it \\"La Guelaguetza de la Raza\\". The event began to take on a more modern form, as an opportunity for each people or region to showcase their unique dance. It also began to become more of a performance than a ritual festival. In the 1970s, the city built a stadium dedicated to the Guelaguetza on a prominent place on Fortin Hill. National and international tourism have increased since the ancient city of Oaxaca and Monte Alb√°n was designated in 1987 as a UNESCO world heritage city. In November 1994, a modern, limited access highway was completed to the city. Before the highway, transportation was so slow that it was virtually impossible to journey there for a weekend at the Guelaguetza from other areas, such as Mexico City. The rugged, often remote, mountainous high-altitude terrain discouraged casual visitors. In 2010 the city completed a new structure for the festival, also built as an open-air amphitheater built into the Cerro del Fort√≠n, overlooking center city. It includes more seating, as well as areas for bands and performance stages, and can support modern lighting and sound. In contemporary Oaxaca, indigenous communities from the state gather at the Guelaguetza to present their native cultures, mainly in the form of music, costumes, dances, and food. It is the most famous indigenous gathering of its kind in Mexico. The Guelaguetza celebration includes many related side events, including a performance of \\"Princess Donaj√≠\\", an epic based on indigenous tradition, which is performed the day before the Guelaguetza begins. Dates celebrated Each year, the Guelaguetza is celebrated on the two Mondays immediately following July 16, except when the first Monday falls on July 18, the day on which Benito Ju√°rez died in 1872. A Zapotec, he became a lawyer and politician, and was the first indigenous president of Mexico, serving from 1858 to 1872. In those years, the celebrations are postponed for one week, falling on July 25 and August 1 (as occurred in 2011). Concurrent events associated with the festival, such as concerts and plays, are all held during the month of July. Controversy The new Guelaguetza auditorium, completed in 2010. Guelaguetza. As the festival became a bigger tourist attraction, some indigenous leaders objected to the ancient traditions being used for commercial purposes. Some people in Oaxaca have supported a Populist Guelaguetza, or a return to the celebrations as they believe they were practiced, for the peoples themselves, before colonialism and the current system. In 2005 the regional government planned to conduct two performances a day of dance groups for each of the two Mondays. Many traditionalists believed this was disrespectful to indigenous culture, and an attempt to appropriate it by powerful economic forces and political interests, in order to accommodate more monied, ticket-purchasing, national and international tourists. Grassroots opposition formed, and the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO) (in Spanish, the Asamblea Popular del Pueblo de Oaxaca) organized out of groups that were protesting. The Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI) - led state government and its leader tried to suppress the protests with armed confrontation, which resulted in deaths of three reporters. In 2006, the government-sponsored Guelaguetza was not held at the Fort√≠n hill as planned. Instead, the APPO organized a free, shared, \\"Popular Guelaguetza\\", trying to return it to the people. The following year, the 2007 official Guelguetza celebration was boycotted by the APPO. But their attempts to hold a Popular Guelaguetza were thwarted by government police repression and state-sponsored military violence throughout the city. Due to some changes made in the makeup of the state government and the PRI's longstanding one-party monopoly on power in the state, subsequent Guelaguetza festivals have had a lesser degree of civil unrest, although numerous controversial issues still remain.  In the U.S.  Oaxan immigrants to the US have celebrated Guelaguetza there. In the U.S. the immigrants typically hold the Guelaguetza celebrations on Sundays, in keeping with standard work schedules, and usually in the summer months, ranging from late June to early August. Usually they have only one day of celebrations, but may have a party the day before, similar to the calenda, a parade in Oaxaca. The Guelaguetzas in the U.S. consist of traditional dances performed by ethnic groups. Organizers usually provide for stands where companies or individuals can sell typical goods and food of Oaxaca, sometimes imported from Oaxaca for authenticity. Musical bands are brought from Oaxaca to accompany the dancers. Many of the Guelaguetzas are sponsored in part by TV stations, including Telemundo, local newspapers, community organizations, and companies. The celebrations have often received coverage from major newspapers, such as the LA Times. One of the earliest Guelaguetzas in the US was held in Los Angeles, California, a center of Latino culture. The Organizaci√≥n Regional de Oaxaca (ORO) sponsored it and helped organize it. As with the Populist Guelaguetza, entry to the Guelaguetza is free. In 2012, the site of the Guelaguetza was moved from an area dominated by Zapotec people to one on the Eastside, in order to reach a wider audience. This Guelaguetza is also supported by different companies as well. It has the support of the restaurant Guelaguetza. Many different smaller companies that attend to get public recognition. In Santa Cruz, California, the county government recognized the Guelaguetza as an official tradition. The organization Senderos: Creating Pathways helped establish it. The Guelaguetza in Santa Cruz takes place on the third Sunday each May, earlier than most others, and has been a festival for around 14 years so far. The Guelaguetza uses a regional group of dancers who have also been appearing at smaller community events. Their musical performances had been performed by a band from San Jose, and then , for a time before the community decided to hire a native band straight from Oaxaca. However, they are beginning to train musicians from Santa Cruz in order to increase community involvement. Additionally, the Guelaguetza is held in San Jose, California. Lazos Oaxaque√±os leads the festival, which includes more modern aspects such as mezcal tasting. An entrance fee is charged to raise money for the festival and community. This particular Guelaguetza received the support from Senderos when it first began. The groups Lazos Oaxaquenos and Senderos often rely on each others to produce the different Guelaguetzas. The San Jose festival first used a local band, but they have also hired a native band to come from Oaxaca to perform with dancers. A majority of Guelaguetzas have been held on the West Coast because of its centers of population of immigrants from Oaxaca. But there have also been such festivals on the East Coast. The consulate of Mexico in New York advertises Guelaguetzas that are held in New Brunswick, NJ, Brooklyn, NY, and in Poughkeepsie, NY.  Social implications in the U.S.  Other Hispanic organizations have worked to provide support for their communities in the US. Many have sought to help people from Oaxaca retain their culture after immigrating to the U.S. They also provide activities and support to the children of these communities. The group ORO does not limit their support to indigenous Oaxacans; it provides a \\"scholarship fund that has been awarded to various students to pursue a higher education\\". The group Senderos also gives scholarships to high school seniors to continue their education, and provides academic tutoring and skill classes to both the youth and adults. Lazos Oaxaquenos focuses on building a Oaxaca community in Northern California, helping make people aware of different services that are available to them. Specifically, they focus on communication between the local government, consulates, media (newspapers, TV, etc.) and the people.

It is an outlier on the north-west flank of Scafell Pike, England‚Äôs highest mountain. Topography Although standing in the shadow of its taller parent, Lingmell is very much a separate entity. In the manner of many fells it displays two contrasting aspects. The southern and western slopes‚Äì although steep‚Äì are smooth and rounded, while the northern and eastern faces fall as crags directly from the summit. The northern crag drops for a thousand feet toward the valley floor, with a further thousand feet of scree below. The connection to Scafell Pike is via Lingmell Col, a grassy depression at 2,410 ft. Flowing west from the col is Lingmell Gill, descending through Hollow Stones to Brackenclose at the head of Wast Water. To the east of Lingmell Col runs Piers Gill, a stream descending from high on the Scafells. This flows right around the northern perimeter of Lingmell, finally entering Wast Water as Lingmell Beck, only a short distance from the entry point of Lingmell Gill. These two streams which girdle the fell both run through wide boulder strewn courses, evidence of flash flooding and the endless fall of rocks from the upper slopes. Lingmell sends out a long shoulder westward between the two streams. The southern face of this, riven with scree on its slow tumbling journey into Lingmell Gill is named Lingmell Scars. At the top of the shoulder are the many outcrops of Goat Crags. Piers Gill runs below the eastern crags of Lingmell in a deep ravine, one of the finest in the District. Averaging about 30 ft, but much deeper in places, it pursues an L-shaped course down the fellside before emerging from its cutting to merge with Greta Gill. The scenery of Piers Gill and Lingmell from the Corridor Route ascent of Scafell Pike is remarkable and a faint path follows the eastern bank of the gill giving even more intimate views. The ravine appears to offer access at either end, but ordinary walkers should on no account attempt to follow it. Crossings of the ravine should also be considered impossible for the average hiker. Geology Lava flows of Scafell Dacite cross the fell, interspersed with andesite and hybridized andesite porphyry.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit The summit of Lingmell is directly above the crags on the eastern side, a fine cairn having been constructedRichards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): to replace the thin column described by Wainwright in the 1960s. This is one of the finest vantage points for Great Gable, a little over a mile to the north. Particularly impressive is the view of the Great Napes, one of the nurseries of the sport of rock climbing. Alfred Wainwright wrote in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells of: ‚Äò‚Ä¶the surprising aspect of Great Gable across the deep gulf of Lingmell Beck‚Ä¶the eye being deceived into seeing its half-mile of height as quite perpendicular‚Äô. From the summit of Goat Crags to the south is an equally astounding view of Scafell Crag, another early climbers‚Äô playground on Scafell. Ascents Lingmell is often bypassed by walkers aiming for Scafell Pike and Scafell, but it is a rewarding ascent in its own right, or as part of a circuit of the Scafell range. There are two ascent routes from Wasdale Head, via Brown Tongue or Piers Gill, but the latter route provides better walking and impressive views of the Piers Gill ravine and Great Gable. The ascent from Borrowdale and Styhead Tarn is made by the Corridor Route. View from Corridor route showing Piers Ghyll on left.

The village has the Anglican parish church of St Michael the Archangel which, because of its high scissor beam roof, is sometimes known as \\"The Barn of Kent\\".Kent Resources History The earliest known date for Smarden is 1205, when Adam de Essex became the Rector of the parish. The area was covered by the forest of Anderida and when clearings were made, the River Beult (a tributary of the River Medway) formed the drainage channel. The local woollen industry was encouraged by King Edward III who brought weaver craftsmen over from Flanders to create what was to become one of England's biggest industries. Edward in recognition granted the village a Royal Charter in 1333 permitting them to hold a weekly market and an annual fair thus elevating the status from village to \\"Town\\". Elizabeth I, en route from Sissinghurst Castle to Boughton Malherbe in 1576, was so impressed by what she saw and ratified the previously granted Charter. A copy of the Charter hangs in the village church.The Smarden Parish Guide Houses right Smarden became very prosperous and some fine houses were built in the 15th and 16th centuries, many of which remain today. The Cloth Hall (1430) is an example of a fifteenth-century yeoman's timber hall house. Although built as a farm it became the central clearing warehouse for the local cloth industry; the broad- cloth would have been taken from there to the port of Faversham. Jubilee House on Pluckley Road is a Grade II listed house built c. 1772. During the Second World War, houses in Smarden, such as Gilletts, were used to relocate evacuees from London.One of Many: An evacuee's story Geography The area is drained by the headwaters of the two major rivers ultimately flowing north, via Maidstone to the west or Ashford to the east. These rivers are the River Medway and the River Stour however many of these headwaters are only seasonal. The civil parish has no A roads, motorways.

Biography Pope Benedict XIV Museum of Grenoble. He was born in Rome and became a student of Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari and Camillo Rusconi. His most familiar works are the colossal Oceanus or Neptune of the Trevi Fountain, Rome, after a modello by Giovanni Battista Maini, and four prominent tomb monuments in Rome. He sculpted the figures for the tomb of Benedict XIII (1734) in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, which was designed by the architect Carlo Marchionni, and for the tomb of Benedict XIV (1763‚Äì1770) in the Basilica of Saint Peter, completed with the help of his pupil Gaspare Sibilia. The third tomb at St Peter's on which he worked commemorates Maria Clementina Sobieski (1742), wife of the \\"Old Pretender\\", James Stuart, one of the Catholic Stuart claimants to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. It is one of three monuments in St. Peter's dedicated to the deposed royal line of Stuart. The sculpture is in polychrome with an image of Maria Clementina in mosaic held aloft by Charity. The monument was conceived by the architect Filippo Barigioni, who provided preliminary sketches. Bracci also designed and sculpted the polychromatic tomb of Cardinal Giuseppe Renato Imperiali (1741) in Sant'Agostino in Rome. The Sobieski tomb His best known work is the colossal Oceanus‚Äî also known as Neptune ‚Äî (after 1759) of the Trevi Fountain, Rome, where he was constrained to follow a plaster modello by Giovanni Battista Maini, who died before he could execute the marble. Bracci executed the Oceanus and the tritons when he took over work on the fountain. After the death of Nicola Salvi (1751) work was halted with only the foundations built. A few years later the works were assigned to Panini who was stopped when he started to make changes to the project. Bracci took over in 1761 and finished the fountain in 1763. Nicola Salvi and Pietro Bracci were longtime friends, both being members of Arcadia and members of the confraternity of the virtuosi at the Pantheon. There are several official busts of Benedict XIII by Bracci, and a terracotta (1724), conserved in Palazzo Venezia, Rome. The aged glare of the pope in the marble portrait was an image difficult to beautify. Like all sculptors in Rome since the 16th century, Bracci was often called upon to restore or complete Roman sculptures, such as the Capitoline Antinous, to render them suitable for display. Bracci had a wide range of interests as known from his manuscripts, most of them are today lost. These interests included architecture, military engineering, sundials but also Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.I Geroglifici ed Obelischi Eggizzi, 'opera postuma inedita di Pietro Bracci', 1767 Bracci died in Rome in 1773.

The group consists of 2,000 to 3,000 members throughout North America and Latin America. Members, referred to as missionaries, who come from a variety of different socio- economic backgrounds, dedicate their time to spreading the word of God. Training before becoming missionaries include reading and studying the Word daily, praying and communal events. Using the Bible as their source of doctrine, adepts carry out various activities such as spiritual counseling, Disaster Relief teams, seasonal programs that consist in the distribution of food and toys for the community, missionary training programs, and charity works through the collection of donations. The group believes in the tenets of the New Testament and uses the Ten Commandments as their moral and spiritual guide. The missionaries are best known for their distinct uniforms which include white garments decorated with burgundy stripes. They also observe the Sabbath, the Biblical Laws of Health, Divine Healing and adhere to the Discipleship as a way of life.  Doctrine = 1.1 The Ten Commandments  Their doctrine is guided by the Ten Commandments. # Thou shalt have no other gods before me. # Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. # Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. # Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour; and do all thy work; But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: For in six days the LORD made thy heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. # Honour thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. # Thou shalt not kill. # Thou shalt not commit adultery. # Thou shalt not steal. # Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. # Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor‚Äôs house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor‚Äôs wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour‚Äôs.  Beliefs and Creed  Their creed in a nutshell may be found in the WHAT WE BELIEVE section in their own website. It is a Christian-Judeo denomination distinguished by the Observance of the Sabbath and emphasis in the Second Coming of Christ. Its theology corresponds to the Christian teachings of the infallibility of the Scriptures and the Trinity. Although similar in beliefs to the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, it differs in the belief of a more rigid system of keeping the Sabbath and the keeping of the Second Commandment in avoiding images of all sorts in their homes and on themselves.  2.1 Baptism  The doctrine embraces Trinitarianism, immortality of the soul, and the process of being baptized in immersion as the first step towards salvation as cited in Mark 28:19 on their official website. According to the Holy Scriptures those ages 12 and up may be baptized .  2.2 Keeping the Sabbath  Every Saturday, members of this organization gather to commemorate the fourth commandment which declares that the seventh day be kept holy. Any daily activities are paused on this day and instead are replaced with worship from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset.  Practices = 3.1 Discipleship  Derived from John 8:31, those who wish to become full members of the organization, can become disciples. This position designates members to become learners of the Bible with combined worship.  3.2 Evangelism  This organization is also known for their door to door preaching approach. Members can be seen spreading their literature in the form of pamphlets and offering bible studies.  3.3 Divine Healing  Through a strict prayer routine and a spiritual mindset, those who are granted the discipleship, carry out activities that involve praying for any one who is in need of being healed of a spiritual or physical illness. This activity may be carried out either in public or in private.  3.4 Dietary Guidelines  Members ascribe to the laws of health as described in Leviticus. Eating unclean meats such as pork is forbidden and as such requires members to eat accordingly. Members are required to abide by Kosher law.  History = Background (1922-1929)  Originally founded in 1990 by the then Bishop Rolando Gonzalez Washington, the roots of the Missionary Church go back to the 1920s in Cuba. In the years 1922 to 1924, Ernest William Sellers, better known as Daddy John, started preaching in Cuba in his own place of business where he sold toys and sorts. In this same business establishment, Sellers would turn it into a worship center called, ‚ÄúMisi√≥n Gedeon‚Äù (Gideons‚Äôs Mission). Ernest William Sellers (better known as Daddy John) was born on August 30, 1869 in Portage County, Wisconsin. His family were members of the Methodist Church. In 1924, George Smith, also a Christian missionary, was said to have revealed the doctrine of Christ to Ernest. From then on, Sellers started to preach the ‚Äúrevealed doctrine‚Äù by visiting eight countries in the Americas before returning to Cuba in 1930. In 1928, Sellers was greeted at his place of living by two spiritual beings who revealed to him that images of all sorts could not be present in any form. After this meeting, Sellers declared September 30 to be the ‚ÄúDay of the Holocaust‚Äù in which all images of all types would be brought by the parishioners to burn at a bonfire in commemoration of the Second Commandment.  The Church under Ernest W. Sellers (1930-1953)  After returning from his trips of 1924-1927, on March 25, 1930, Sellers officially established the church in Cuba as ‚ÄúIglesia Bando Evang√©lico Gede√≥n‚Äù or (Gideon Evangelical Band Church). His first church activities included a large scale preaching campaign and divine healing which yielded successful results. From June 13th 1928 up until his death in 1953, together with his wife Muriel C. Sellers oversaw the work in Cuba from his central headquarters in Playa Baracoa. In 1939, Sellers created a monthly newspaper called, ‚ÄúEl Mensajero de Los Postreros D√≠as‚Äù (The Last Days Messenger). In it, Sellers wrote world news and religious exhortations and literature. The Messenger was distributed free as a result of donations that were collected from people, which it would then go into the production of the newspaper. The donations would also go to the construction of new churches and to support other church activities. As head of the church, throughout the years, Sellers reorganized and changed the internal disciplines of the church. The Messenger, also gives first mention of the Church Annual Conferences which would continue up to the present day. Sellers created a strict hierarchy within the church. Sellers appointed ‚ÄúMayordomos de Provincia‚Äù (Provincial Church Administrator) and ‚ÄúMayordomos de Distritos‚Äù (District Church Administrator) to head the regional sections of the church. They in turn had to report to the Mayordomo General (General Church Administrator), Sellers, and their monthly activities; some of these were published in The Messenger. Sellers took on the title of Bishop around 1939. All members of the church had to report their whereabouts and activities in writing to the church administrator who in turn would deliver them to the main headquarters. Other ranks included: Member, Good Samaritan, Watchtower, Member of the Light Brigade, Disciple, Lieutenant, Captain, Teacher, Preacher, and Evangelist. While Sellers built churches, he also preached and baptized people. Records indicate that in the late 1940s the church had well over a total of 20,000 members . The largest baptismal record made was seventy-one people in one day. Sellers, now under the title of Apostle, which was given in 1946, died on February 25, 1953 in Playa Baracoa at the age of 83.  Succession of Apostles (1953-1987)  Sellers declared that the Bishop of Great Echelon, √Ångel Mar√≠a Hern√°ndez would succeed him in the office of Apostle. Hern√°ndez was baptized by Sellers in 1937. As Majordomo he carried out his job mostly in Las Tunas. As an apostle, Hern√°ndez oversaw the expansion of the church into international lands such as Jamaica, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Chile and Haiti. He died on December 27, 1961 at the age of 61. A year before his death, after a revelation from Christ that he would survive one more year before death he announced that the new successor would be Arturo Rangel Sosa . In 1947, Arturo Rangel Sosa was baptized by the Supervisor (Majordomo was changed to Supervisor) Roberto Mondejar. Having been recalled from Panama by the presiding bishops, he replaced Angel Mar√≠a as apostle in 1962. Rangel added Internacional (International) to the church‚Äôs name in 1964. In 1966, along with his brother Jos√© Rangel Sosa, a bishop of the church, and an Evangelist named Heliodoro Castillo, disappeared while on their way to Matanzas. That same year, two bishops of the church took command and established a ‚ÄúJunta de Obispos‚Äù (Board of Bishops). Due to the tensions that were escalating between the Castro regime and the churches, these bishops managed to leave the country on February 27, 1968. Both of them set up the church in Tampa, Florida but then changed the headquarters to Miami, Florida. Both bishops were assigned the ranks of Archbishop in 1971. In 1974, the church‚Äôs name was changed once again. In 1986, both archbishops were ordained as the new apostles. On October 14, 1987, Samuel Mendiondo, one of the two archbishops, died.  Reorganization (1990-1993)  A bishop by the name of Rolando Gonzalez Washington, head of the church in California and the western part of the United States, which he had founded in 1970, disagreed with what he saw as transgressions within the church. He believed that certain changes and other things that were not permitted under the Sellers administration were now beginning to make an entrance into the church and were not part of the original doctrine proclaimed by Sellers. In early 1990, Rolando Gonzalez openly split the western section of the church from the eastern section of the church which was based in Miami. He placed his headquarters in Bell Gardens, California and renamed the organization Church of the Soldiers of the Cross of Christ of the State of California.  Legitimacy (1990-1993)  During these years, there were a series of legal battles. In these years both factions, the California and the Florida main headquarters, found themselves embroiled in federal courts over matters of legitimacy and sovereignty. As a result, the California church had to change the appearance of its uniforms, insignias, and logos. The church renamed itself one last time, changing its name to Missionary Church of the Disciples of Jesus Christ. Reasons given for the separation were that the Miami church had deviated from the original doctrine preached by Daddy John (Ernest William Sellers) and therefore was no longer guided by the same Holy Spirit.  The New Church (1990-Present)  Now officially a separate legal entity from the Miami church, the California-based Missionary Church proceeded to build more churches and missions through the work of its missionaries. Its missionaries were taught the bible through the Estudios Biblicos (Bible Studies) program. They also went out in front of stores and supermarkets to ask for voluntary donations with plastic bags, which then evolved into the recognizable white cans that they carry today. New churches were made in different parts of the world, most notably in the Americas. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the Missionary Church had its own radio space called Con La Biblia En La Mano (With The Bible In Hand), which transmitted every Sunday on Radio KALY . On August 26, 1993 Rolando Gonzalez was ordained as Apostle-Director. In May of that same year, he relocated the main headquarters from Bell Gardens, California to Covina, California. The Apostle Gonzalez died on December 10, 2004. He was succeeded by the Bishops Caesar Rivera Lewis and David Higuera Rol√≥n, marking the beginning of the Board of Bishops which ended in 2007, when Caesar Rivera was proclaimed the new Apostle-Director.  Organization and Structure = Ranks  The Missionary Church divides its members into ranks which carry unique responsibilities. # Apostle-Director # Bishop # Major Superintendent # Superintendent # Major Supervisor # Supervisor # Super Deaconess # Deaconess # Deacon # Super Evangelist # Evangelist # Pastor Evangelist # Preacher # Disciple # Anointed # Member  The Apostolic Succession  The Apostolic Succession is headed and composed by Apostles. According to the Missionary Church, the Apostles or Apostle are direct successors and continuation of the original ministry headed by Peter the Apostle. The Directorate recognizes Ernest William Sellers, √Ångel Mar√≠a Hern√°ndez, Arturo Rangel, Samuel Mendiondo, and Rolando G. Washington as successors to the twelve apostles, hence creating the apostolic line of succession, which they call the Apostolic Family. Its duties include overseeing the entire welfare of the church and head what they refer to as The Apostolic Board of Council Officers.  Apostolic Board of Council Officers  The Apostolic Board of Council Officers is composed of the Bishops, Major Superintendents, Superintendents, Major Supervisors, and Supervisors. The officers are also in charge of safe- guarding the doctrine in their respective churches.  Charity through donations  The Missionary Church of the Disciples of Jesus Christ is best known for their white uniforms and the white donation bins. They can be seen outside stores and streetlights asking for donations that are used for charity through missionary training programs, My Father‚Äôs House (which are properties used to offer free housing, meals and clothing to people seeking spiritual guidance and as such have undergone physical or emotional hardship), Disaster Relief programs, church missions and seasonal programs for the community to receive free toys and meals.  Culture = Annual Conferences  Each year, the Missionary Church organizes what they call the International Annual Conferences. These conferences usually take place in the United States around March . This event sets the tone for the year and includes prayers, biblical reenacting, and the proclamation and welcoming of new members. More than 1,000 people attend this event.  Special Programs  The church offers prison visitations, hospital visitations, as well as a Food and Disaster Relief program. They also offer a Youth and Preparatory School program which aims at spreading its beliefs and a Family Orientation program which aims to help families in need of moral guidance. Furthermore, The House of my Father program is a rehabilitation program which aims at providing help (free housing, food and clothing) to those in need of rehabilitation (drug, alcohol and spiritual). It has been reported that people ranging from single mothers to entire families have been a part of this program.  Evangelical Campaigns  Evangelical Campaigns consist of different sections of the country which are then subdivided into their respective cities (for example, the Campaign of Southern California consists of the Campaign of Covina, etc.). This also includes other countries as well. Their main objectives are to evangelize and to work in collecting donations outside stores and streetlights for the use of Disaster Relief programs, The House of my Father program and church missions.  Demographics = North America  There are several missions across the U.S. including establishments in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Washington.  Latin America  With several missions across Latin America, the Missionary Church has established missions in Mexico in Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Puebla, Chiapas, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. In Central America, they have missions in Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica. In South America, missions have been established in Colombia and Brazil. Lastly, the Caribbean Islands currently features a mission in the Dominic Republic and Puerto Rico.  Europe  During the years 1993 to 2013, the presence of two pastors were leading a mission in Barcelona, Spain. It is reported that there were members from Russia, Czech Republic, Armenia, Brazil and Mexico at the Barcelona mission.  External Criticism  External critics have questioned certain practices of this organization, including the governance system and disciplines on issues such as clothing, personal adornment, banning the use of vehicles on Saturdays, and banning television. For example, an external group called the ‚ÄúCenter for Religious Research‚Äù has classified such practices in the Missionary Church as ‚Äúlegalists‚Äù, arguing that such disciplines are too rigid and too unsubstantiated by the Bible.

History In 1985, six years after developers Pat Cicalese (owner of the Chelsea Pool and the Mile a Minute Waterslide) and his business partner Carmen Ricci purchased the Long Branch Pier across the street that they had been leasing since the year prior to the purchase, Cicalese rethemed the pier, the pool, the Bumper Boats, and the waterslide as Kid's World, inspired by Sesame Place in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Cicalese purchased Ricci's half of the business in 1980). Many of the rides from years past had been replaced by this time by new rides, but the park still drew adults. The famous Haunted Mansion that started the revamp of the pier in 1978 remained as part of Kid's World. Kid's World also featured an attraction based on the popular children's program Romper Room. The park was heavily advertised on TVO in New York and New Jersey. The previous advertisements for the pier were mostly geared towards the Haunted Mansion, but when the Kid's World concept was introduced, the advertisements were toned down to something more family friendly. The park's mascot was Sammy the Sea Lion, who was featured in the park's logo and on animated commercials. Fire and closure On June 8, 1987, at around 3 pm, a fire broke out at the McDonald's at the end of the pier. The fire quickly spread throughout the pier, despite efforts by the Long Branch Fire Department to save it. After the fire, all that remained of Kid's World were the water attractions across the street from the pier. However, after the fire, business had slowed down, so the rest of Kid's World closed down for good at the end of that summer. Cicalese had planned to rebuild the pier. However, his insurance didn't cover the cost to rebuild what was destroyed, and the town would not fund the project, so the plans were abandoned. What was left of Kid's World remained abandoned for 17 years after the fire. What was left of the pier had deteriorated over the years, and it was demolished in 2001. The rest of Kid's World across the street was demolished in 2002. Today The site of Kid's World is now occupied by Pier Village, a retail/dining/condo complex. The redevelopment has revived the booming business that was once enjoyed by Kid's World. A new pier is being planned for the Long Branch waterfront, but it is not known whether the amusements will return as part of the new pier. TV advertisement jingle The franchise also had a jingle for advertisements with a man and kids singing the jingle. :Man: It's a Kid's World that surrounds you. It's happening all around you. :The fun that makes the magic moments, every face tells a story. :Kids and Man: Dizzy dizzy spins, Jumpin up, Poppin in. :Riding down, climbing high, it all begins at the neatest kids place in the whole wide world! :Share the magic moment at...

The vehicle looks like a motorcycle with a sidecar attached, however unlike the former, the \\"sidecar\\" of the Domani is structurally an integral part of the frame. In Japan, a motorcycle license is not required to drive it, a normal car license is sufficient. Body & Chassis Rear view of a Domani The Domani is built around a torsionally rigid tubular steel frame with structurally integrated sidecar unit. As mentioned above, the sidecar portion of the vehicle is an integral part of the frame. One of the advantages of this is that the frame is torsionally stiffer than that of a regular sidecar equipped motorcycle. Also, the suspension and layout for the two rear wheels can now be more car-like, with the sidecar's wheel being driven as well, making the vehicle a true rear-wheel drive. The unique frame also allows for aerodynamic fibreglass bodywork that wouldn't be possible in a traditional set-up. This in turn allows for some unique packaging of the components, for example the radiator is mounted in the sidecar where it's better exposed to airflow. The aerodynamic skin also allows for the inclusion of a small luggage compartment in the back. Engine The Domani is powered by a BMW K 1200 engine producing 150 hp and connected to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine, coupled with the Domani's light curb weight (390 kg) is enough to power the vehicle to a factory specified maximum of over 200 km/h. Suspension The Domani utilizes 3 wheel independent suspension with double-wishbones at the rear and dual rocker arms at the front. These are connected to 185/60 - R14 tyres at the front and in the sidecar and 195/60 - R15 tyred at the rear.

Life Born at Kingsley House, Maidstone, Kent, Julius Brenchley was educated at Maidstone Grammar School and then St John's College, Cambridge. He was set for a life in the Church, having been ordained at Holy Trinity, Maidstone, in 1843. However, in 1845, his father persuaded Brenchley to accompany him on a European tour, and he was bitten by the travel bug. From 1845 to 1867 he travelled the world, collecting, recording and sending material home. He was a passionate collector of art, ethnography and natural history, and was called a 'gentleman explorer'. Travelling the globe in search of knowledge and adventure, he sent many artefacts from his travels home which are now on display in Maidstone museum. A park adjacent to the museum, Brenchley Gardens, is named after him to honour his contributions, both cultural and financial, to the museum. During his travels, Brenchley visited every continent except Antarctica. He was especially active in the South Seas. Brenchley spent much of his adult life exploring the world in his tireless search for knowledge. His life was shaped by his 'passionate love of wandering'. He never got married because he was too busy exploring. He died aged only 56, on February 24, 1873 in a Folkestone hotel and is buried in the family vaults at All Saints' Church, Maidstone.

He was active from the 1930s to the 1970s and often used Times Square as the backdrop of his memorable works. Early life Freeman was born in San Diego, California. He attended high school in St. Louis, moved to New York City in late 1928. He studied at the San Diego School of Fine Arts and, after graduation, he earned passage to New York by playing the cornet with a ship's orchestra. He arrived at the city days before the stock market crash of 1929 and earned money as a dance band musician. He enrolled at the Art Students League of New York where he studied graphic design and lithography under John Sloan, Harry Wickey, and Kathryn E. Cherry. Career Frequent subjects of Freeman's included Broadway theater, politics, and the circus. Freeman was known for carrying a sketchbook with him wherever he went. His images depicted New York City, and the faces of the people he observed on the streets, in the theaters, and in the subways. They often included images of showgirls, Bowery Boys, drunks, apple sellers, window washers and numerous citizens of the city that were down on their luck. Freeman was also a jazz musician and the brother of hotel entrepreneur Warren Freeman. As Freeman's career progressed, he lightened his palette and depicted more upbeat subjects. In 1951, he began illustrating children's books. His wife, Lydia, who was also an accomplished artist, authored some of the books Freeman illustrated. The Freemans eventually moved to Santa Barbara, California, where they spent the remainder of their lives.Anderson, Alissa J., Don Freeman (1908-1978), Anderson Shea Art Appraisals Don Freeman was first introduced to children's literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. These include Human Comedy, which is considered one of his best-known works. However, his greatest influence came from the artist Honor√© Daumier. Freeman studied many of Daumier's works, particularly his caricatures. He also owned a large collection of books on the artist. Throughout Don Freeman's career, he was the writer and illustrator of more than 20 children's books. He is best known for his publication of Corduroy. Although he came up with many of his ideas on his own, his wife Lydia Freeman contributed greatly to his success; indeed, she co-wrote two books with him, Chuggy and the Blue Caboose and Pet of the Met. She was very influential on her husband's work, as he relied on her for inspiration for his pieces. He would read his work aloud to her as well as any children around in order to gain feedback on a particular piece. Lydia too became a well-known artist in her later life. In his autobiography \\"Come One, Come All!Rhinehart & Company, Inc, New York, 1949, p. 244-45. Don humorously admits that of the two, she was the better (watercolor) artist. \\"Simplicity is the essence of children's-book stories, not simple-mindedness\\", Don Freeman once stated when speaking to an audience that was interested in writing, illustrating, and publishing children's books. When Freeman lived in New York City during the 1930s, 40s, and early 1950s, he was a brilliant illustrator of city life in the best traditions of Social Realism. His subjects were the actors and actresses of Broadway‚Äîfrom Orson Welles to Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne to the man in the street or the charwomen who scrubbed the stage after the actors and the audience went home. His cartoons and other illustrations appeared regularly in the New York Herald Tribune, The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, and Theater Magazine. Freeman also self- published Don Freeman's Newsstand, a short-lived quarterly magazine, each page of which was an original lithograph. In 1976, Freeman was recognized by the City of New York for his body of work portraying the city. The New York Daily News reported on the Citation from Mayor Abraham D. Beame, which was presented to Freeman at the opening of a one-man retrospective exhibition. In a measure of Freeman's national fame, The Christian Science Monitor covered the 1976 exhibition, as well as a 1978 retrospective, both of which showcased Freeman's drawings, oils, prints, and his limited-edition self-published periodical, Don Freeman's Newsstand.\\"Goings On About Town\\", The New Yorker, April 12, 1976, p. 11.\\"Goings On About Town\\", The New Yorker, March 13, 1978, p. 14.

Life and career Desplechin was born in Roubaix. He is the son of Robert and Mado Desplechin, and grew up in the Nord department. He has a brother named Fabrice who has acted in several of his films, and two sisters: novelist Marie Desplechin and screenwriter Rapha√´lle Desplechin. Arnaud Desplechin studied film directing at the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle then at the IDHEC, graduating in 1984. He made three short films inspired by the work of the Belgian novelist Jean Ray. During the late 1980s, Desplechin worked as a director of photography on several films. In 1990, Desplechin directed La vie des morts, starring several actors who would go on to appear in multiple Desplechin films, such as Marianne D√©nicourt, Emmanuelle Devos, Emmanuel Salinger and Thibault de Montalembert. The 54-minute-long film won the Jean Vigo Prize for Short Films, and was shown at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Desplechin's first feature-length movie, The Sentinel, premiered in 1992 at Cannes, starring several actors from La vie des morts as well as Mathieu Amalric, Chiara Mastroianni, and L√°szlo Szab√≥, who have also become frequent Desplechin collaborators. Desplechin's 1996 film My Sex Life... or How I Got Into an Argument was critically successful. In 2000, Desplechin made his first English-language film, Esther Kahn, adapted from a short story by Arthur Symons, and starred Summer Phoenix in the title role. The film was seen as a homage to Fran√ßois Truffaut's work because it deals with coming of age (a favorite Truffaut theme) and uses the New Wave cinema techniques that Truffaut pioneered. Three years later, Desplechin made two films adapting Edward Bond's play Playing 'In the Company of Men': one showing 70% rehearsal footage and 30% of the film itself; and the other with inverse proportions. The next year, he directed Kings and Queen, which mixed comedy and tragedy to tell the story of two ex-lovers played by Amalric and Devos. The film also starred Catherine Deneuve in the role of a psychiatrist. Kings and Queen was nominated for several awards and Amalric won the C√©sar Award for Best Actor. However, controversy arose when actress Marianne Denicourt, Desplechin's ex-girlfriend, accused him of revealing elements of her private life in the screenplay of Kings and Queen. In 2005, she published Mauvais g√©nie (\\"Evil Genius\\"), describing her relationship with an unscrupulous film director called \\"Arnold Duplancher.\\" In 2006, she unsuccessfully sued Desplechin.¬´ Rois et reine ¬ª, d'Arnaud Desplechin, devant la justice, Le Monde du 5 avril 2006 In 2007, Desplechin filmed L'Aim√©e, a documentary showing his father, his brother, and his nephews in the family house in Roubaix just before it was to be sold. That same year, he filmed the family drama A Christmas Tale, starring Deneuve, Amalric, Devos, and Mastroianni. This film was screened in competition at Cannes in 2008. His 2013 film Jimmy Picard was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival constituting his fifth film selected in the main competition. In 2014, he adapted Alexander Ostrovsky's play The Forest. For the drama film My Golden Days (2015), which he directed and co-wrote, Desplechin won the C√©sar Award and Lumi√®res Award for best director, and the SACD Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. In 2016, he was a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. In 2019 film Oh Mercy! was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival constituting his seventh film selected in the main competition.

Although originally intended for a theatrical release in the United States and South America, the film was premiered on the Fox network in those territories a month before the release of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It was released in cinemas in several countries in Europe and elsewhere, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.Susan King, Robin Hood' Role, Fate Collide For Patrick Bergin, The Pittsburgh Press, 05/12/1991 Plot summary The film begins when a miller, who is poaching deer on lands belonging to the King of England, is detected by a hunting party led by the cruel Norman knight Sir Miles Folcanet. The miller flees the hunting party until he runs into a Saxon earl, Robert Hode and his friend, Will. The miller pleads for help and Will urges Hode to intercede, as the Normans arrive threatening to poke the miller's eyes out. Folcanet is enraged by Hode's interference and demands that Hode be punished by the local Sheriff (shire-reeve) Roger Daguerre, who is Hode's friend. Privately Daguerre confides to Hode that he needs peace with Folcanet because he has agreed to give Daguerre a large portion of his niece Marion's wealth once they are married. Publicly Daguerre orders a single stroke of the whip for Hode after he apologizes; Hode is enraged, insulting Daguerre and is outlawed as a result. He flees into Sherwood Forest, meets John Little and the usual cast of Merry Men and under the name \\"Robin Hood\\" takes up arms and fights against the Norman nobility. After seeing Hode's Merry Men humiliate Folcanet, Mariane joins their band in disguise, until a disgruntled outlaw recognizes her and betrays her to the Sheriff. Hode convinces everyone to attack Nottingham Castle to stop the wedding, certain that she loves him. Folcanet is defeated and Daguerre is convinced to set aside their feud and bless the marriage of Robin and Mariane.

Details of the storyline and the identities of the characters differ widely, however, between the two versions. Although the familiar characters Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and Much the Miller's Son appear in this version, the traditional Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisbourne have been replaced by original antagonists. The Baron Daguerre takes the Sheriff's place as the scheming, greedy tax collector (though in this version, he is originally Robin's friend) and Folcanet stands in for Guy as the violent, vindictive knight after Robin's head (and Marian's maidenhead). Unlike many modern versions of the story, King Richard does not appear at the end and instead Daguerre is reconciled with Hode and promises a future where Saxons and Normans are treated equally. Filming It was filmed on location at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, a medieval-style Victorian-era edifice built between 1842 and 1851. Some filming was also done near Betws-y-Coed in North Wales. Other filming locations were Beeston Castle and various locations within the Frodsham area including Heathercliffe and St Lawrence Church.

It lies about north-west of Uckfield, the main road being the A22. Nutley, Fairwarp and Maresfield together form the Maresfield civil parish. The village is on the southern edge of Ashdown Forest which was a deer hunting reserve from the time of King Edward II. Iron has also played an important role in the history of the area.  History  36 miles from Bow Bells The Romans operated nearby in Duddleswell and Maresfield, working the iron ore to be found in the local Weald Clay using bloomeries. Roman coins and waste from furnaces has been found at these locations. When the Romans left Britain in the 5th century AD Saxon settlers lived on the site of Nutley. \\"Hnut's leagh\\" means \\"Hnut's Clearing\\", and is the most likely origin of the village's modern-day name. Following the Norman Invasion of 1066, Nutley became part of the Rape of Pevensey. In 1176 a chapel was built by Richer de Aquila L'Aigle. It was built in an area known as Chapelwood, along the Chelwood Gate road, just outside Nutley's borders. of land near Wych Cross on Ashdown Forest was granted to the chapel. It was attached to the church at Maresfield. The chapel went out of use after the English Reformation. In 1372 Edward III gave the Chapel of Notlye (as it was called at the time) along with almost of land to his son, John of Gaunt. They were both frequent visitors to Ashdown Forest (then known as Lancaster Great Park; it would keep that name for the next three centuries) because of the hunting. Contraband goods, shipped across the English Channel, were smuggled along the packhorse track from Duddleswell to Nutley. In 1721 Gabriel Tomkins, the leader of the Mayfield Gang, was captured and arrested in Nutley having been chased from Burwash. Tomkins was sentenced to seven years transportation, but gained his freedom by giving valuable information to the authorities. He went on to have a mixed career as both smuggler and customs officer, being Custom House Officer at Dartford in Kent in 1735 and Bailiff to the Sheriff of Sussex, but was hanged in 1750 at Bedford for robbing the Chester stage coach.Mary Waugh, Smuggling in Kent and Sussex 1700-1840 1985 pp 68-70 Nutley Windmill, a rare example of an open trestle post mill, was moved to Nutley from Goudhurst, Kent around 1817, her timbers being older than this. Standing on the edge of the forest she was modernised in the 1880s and operated until 1908. It was only in the mid-19th century that the village school and the church, dedicated to Saint James the Less, were built. The land upon which the school was built was donated by the Earl and Countess De La Warr. Both the school and church are still in use today. Piped water was first introduced to the village in the early 20th century, but electricity and telephones did not arrive until the 1930s. During the First World War and Second World War Canadian troops were stationed at Pippingford Park near Nutley. In the Second World War a Wellington bomber returning from a raid over Germany crashed nearby. The crew were killed. In 1944 a stick of bombs from a German plane landed in Nutley, resulting in minor damage. Twenty locals died in combat during the First World War. To commemorate their sacrifice a Memorial Hall was built, situated opposite what is now the village post office. Eighteen others died in the Second World War, and a second memorial hall was built in the 1970s. It stands opposite the school, and there is also a social club, set of committee rooms, a tennis and squash club, and the Parish Council office. The land for this second memorial hall was donated by the Nettlefold family. Today it is managed by the Nutley War Memorial Trust. Geography Nutley Windmill Situated next to Ashdown Forest, Nutley is surrounded by idyllic countryside. Nutley lies on the A22 London to Eastbourne main road. Nutley's terrain near the main road is relatively flat, however the further one drifts from the main road the more undulating the land becomes. Off the A22, there are numerous side-roads and country lanes, many of which hold tradition in the village.  Population  According to the 2001 Census, 1,342 persons live in Nutley. Approximately 47% of the population are male and 53% are female. The population reside in 520 households, and more than a fifth of the population live alone, including pensioners. The population has increased by 5% since the 1991 census.  Economy  Local businesses and amenities include a social club, school, tennis & squash club, antique shop, village pub, Italian and Indian/Thai restaurants; petrol station and shop, school, village shop, two care homes, three motor repair workshops, car showroom and other small enterprises and businesses employ approximately 150 people. There are more than 90 home-based businesses, employing a further 150 people or thereabouts. An estimated 50% of the working population of Nutley commute to the surrounding areas. 60% of Nutley's 16-74 age group are either employed or self-employed with full or part-time work. Few people are unemployed. 70% of this age group possess a type of qualification, while 20% have a first degree or higher qualification.  Notable residents  *Author Neil Gaiman lived in Nutley between 1987 and 1992, and his house there became the setting for his book Coraline. *Musician Robin Romei lived in Nutley as a youth. *Author Barbara Willard lived locally for several years and wrote extensively about the area in fiction and non fiction books.

Distance estimates vary from between 38 and 60 million light years from the Milky Way. The galaxy has a very bright nucleus and a relatively faint disk. Significant warping is visible in the southern half of the disk. The galaxy's relatively large angular size and relatively high surface brightness make it an object that can be viewed and imaged by amateur astronomers. The galaxy's location relatively near Earth and its active galactic nucleus make it a commonly studied object for professional astronomers. Nucleus NGC 5033 contains a Seyfert nucleus, a type of active galactic nucleus. Like many other active galactic nuclei, this galaxy's nucleus is thought to contain a supermassive black hole. The bright emission seen in visible light (as well as other wavebands) is partially produced by the hot gas in the environment around this black hole. Integral field spectroscopic observations of the center of NGC 5033 indicate that the Seyfert nucleus is not located at the kinematic center of the galaxy (the point around which the stars in the galaxies rotate). This has been interpreted as evidence that this galaxy has undergone a merger. The displacement of the Seyfert nucleus from the kinematic center may destabilize the rotation of gas in the center of the galaxy, which could cause gas to fall into the Seyfert nucleus. The gas would be compressed by the enormous gravitational forces in the center of the Seyfert nucleus and become hot, thus making the nucleus appear bright or \\"active\\". Nearby galaxies NGC 5033 and the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5005 comprise a physical galaxy pair. The two galaxies weakly influence each other gravitationally, but they are not yet close enough to each other to be distorted by the tidal forces of the gravitational interaction.

It is the second oldest family-owned brewery in America (after D. G. Yuengling & Son)Fessler, Paul. \\"August Schell.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 2, edited by William J. Hausman. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 29, 2015. and became the oldest and largest brewery in Minnesota when the company bought the Grain Belt rights in 2002. In September 2010, the brewery celebrated its 150th Anniversary with a two-day festival. Every year, Schell's also celebrates traditional German holidays with Bock Fest and Oktoberfest. The current brewery is owned and operated by the August Schell Brewing Company, a Minnesota corporation that was incorporated in 1902.  History  August Schell (February 15, 1828, in Durbach, Grand Duchy of Baden ‚Äì September 20, 1891, in New Ulm, Minnesota) emigrated to the United States in 1848. He worked in Cincinnati as a machinist before relocating to New Ulm with other members of the Turner Society. Upon moving to New Ulm, building on his experience as a machinist, he established a mill. In 1860, August Schell partnered with Jacob Bernhardt to found a brewery to serve the growing German immigrant population in the area. August and Jacob selected a site two miles from the heart of New Ulm along the Cottonwood River. While much of the city of New Ulm was damaged or burned during the Dakota War of 1865, the brewery escaped intact. In 1866, August Schell bought out his partner Jacob Bernahrdt to take sole ownership of the brewery, starting an unbroken chain of family ownership that continues to this day. During this time, the brewery grew in size and production. August Schell died in 1891 leaving the brewery to his wife Theresa. Their son Otto took over managing the brewery. Otto had studied brewing back in the Schells' home country of Germany. As the 19th century became the 20th, Otto continued to modernize the brewery by adding refrigeration to the brewery. 1911 was a tragic year for the Schell family as first Otto and then Theresa died. At that time, George Marti, the husband of August's daughter Emma, took over managing and operating the brewery. 1919 brought about the passage of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and implementation of Prohibition. The August Schell Brewing Company struggled along with many other American breweries. The brewery transitioned to producing \\"near-beer\\" (a low alcohol beer still permitted during Prohibition), soft drinks, and candy. Prohibition ended in 1933 with passage of the 21st Amendment. George Marti had successfully steered the brewery through Prohibition, but died shortly thereafter in 1934. George's son Alfred (\\"Al\\") Marti became the President and Manager of the brewery upon the death of his father. Al ran the brewery until 1969 until he retired and passed leadership of the company to his son Warren Marti. During this time, the brewing industry was going through a period of consolidation and upheaval, and Schell's was not immune. At one point, the brewery only managed to keep its doors open by cutting down a large black walnut tree located on the grounds of the brewery and sold its lumber. During Warren's tenure, the brewery responded to its customers changing preferences by introducing Schell's Export Beer, Schell's Light Beer, and 1919 Root Beer (named after the year prohibition was implemented). In 1984, Warren's son Ted Marti took over operations of the brewery and became President of the brewery in 1985. Having studied at the Siebels Institute of Brewing, Ted began expanding the line of beers offered by the Schell's Brewery. One of those beers, Schell's Pilsener, earned a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in 1988. Schell's continued to expand its beer offerings through the 1990s, brewing 38 different beers over that decade. In 2002, Schell's Brewery expanded its reach by acquiring the recipe and branding for Grain Belt Beer. Upon moving production to its New Ulm Brewery, Schell's introduced additional Grain Belt varieties including Grain Belt Nordeast in 2010, Grain Belt Lock & Dam in 2016 (since retired), Grain Belt BLU in 2018 (after appearing at the Minnesota State Fair for several years), and Grain Belt Southwest Cerveza in 2019. The next generation of the Marti family is increasing its involvement in the management and operation of the brewery. Ted's oldest son Jace Marti became a brewmaster in 2010 and has taken the lead on producing Schell's Noble Star line of sour Berliner Weisse beers. The brewery opened the Starkeller facility on the North side of New Ulm to produce the Noble Star line. This facility also houses a tap room dedicated to these sour ales. The brewery has continued to update its offerings by retiring long time brews such as Maifest, Schmaltz's Alt, and Pils among others, while adding and IPA, a Kolsch and Cream Ale. In 2020, it is expected that the brewery will release a line of hard seltzers as Grain Belt N'icebreakers as well as a low calorie Grain Belt Elite.  Brewery  The historic Schell's brewery is located in New Ulm, Minnesota alongside the Cottonwood River. The brewery has grown and evolved over the decades to accommodate new technology and expanded production lines. In addition to serving as a production facility, the brewery grounds house the historic Schell's mansion, a gift shop, a beer garden, and a deer enclosure. The grounds are open to visitors with tours running out of the gift shop. Peafowl live on the grounds and are free to roam the property.  Events  The August Schell Brewing Company hosts annual Oktoberfest and Bock Fest celebrations on the grounds of the historic Schell's brewery. Oktoberfest, usually held in early October, features a large fest style tent where the Schell's hobo band plays and the Oktoberfest keg is tapped. Bock Fest, held in late February or early March, features a hunt for Bock beers hidden on the grounds of the brewery and nearby Flandrau State Park. Large fire pits are spread throughout the brewery grounds where attendees can have their beers poked with a hot iron. To highlight and celebrate the sour beers produced under its Starkeller label, an annual event called Funk Junction is held at the Starkeller brewery featuring sour and \\"funky\\" beer from breweries across the United States.

This beer is rather light on the palate and very dry. A lively carbonation accentuates the refreshingly tart acidity and a full raspberry flavor with a subtle hint of brett character. * North Country Br√ºnette, ABV 5.4%, The long, slow, secondary fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture to work on the residual sugars that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile.

This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles. * Black Forest Cherry, ABV 5.1%, The maltiness of Black Forest Cherry provides a platform for the tart red cherries to shine through with a highly acidic and fruity character.

Dusty crimson red in color, a tart cherry aroma emanates from the glass atop an underlying spice. A moderate acidity showcases the cherry tang and almond flavors that mingle together, balancing over a toasty malt backbone, and finishing with a lingering sour, yet sweet, cherry zest. * Astral Fusion, ABV 5.4%, Astral Fusion is a mixed-culture Berliner Weisse that was aged for a year in our 80-year-old cypress wood lagering tanks before being transferred onto mangos for an additional three months, and then blended with a portion of raspberry Berliner Weisse before being bottled. The resulting beer is quite tart, bursting with a fruity blend of tropical stone fruit with a hint of raspberries on top of a lemony base acidity. * Static Transmission, ABV 7%, Static Transmission pours a hazy gold in color and is bursting with the aromas of fresh wildflowers, lemons and pineapple. Oats lend a rich, creamy mouthfeel over a bright, sweet and sour character. This is the first of the Noble Star line of beers to be released in smaller, 375 ml bottles.

Standalone Stag Series * Stag Series #1- Barrel Aged Schmaltz Alt, ABV 5.4%, Aged in Red Wine Barrels *Stag Series #2 - Wild Rice Farmhouse Ale. The second release in the Stag Series is August Schell's interpretation of a traditional Belgian Farmhouse Ale. This Farmhouse Ale exhibits an earthy/nutty character due to the generous use of Minnesota Wild Rice, the State Grain of Minnesota. The Wild Rice is combined with 2-Row, Munich, Vienna, and a touch of Rye malt to create a complementary backbone to the unique fermentation characteristics of the yeast. Dry and thirst quenching, this Farmhouse Ale is hopped with Goldings *Stag Series #3- Rauchbier. A blend of malts smoked over beechwood and cherrywood to create a twist on the traditional style. The remainder of the malt bill includes Dark Munich Malt, Caramunich, and a touch of black malt for color. It is hopped with Tettnang and Sterling. *Stag Series #4- Burton Ale. Schell's Burton Ale is a nod to a forgotten style of beer. Using traditional floor malted Fawcett Maris Otter as a base, the malt bill also includes torrified wheat and two different British Crystal malts. As is traditional for British brewers, we added sugar in the kettle, in our case turbinado and some Dark Candi Syrup. Old Burton Extra is hopped with Nugget and Goldings, fermented with a British ale yeast, dry-hopped, and aged for 3 months prior to release. *Stag Series #5- Czech Dark Lager.

Collaboration with Gold Ochsen Brauerei in New Ulm's sister city, Ulm Germany. Both cities are also host to fifth generation family-owned breweries and both breweries were founded by men named August. Working in collaboration, we decided to brew a Blonde Doppel Bock. Both breweries uses specialty malts from Weyerman with each brewery using their own base Pilsner malt ‚Äì Rahr for Schell's and Schwabenmalz for Gold Ochsen.

The pact was not carried out due to the resignation of the government, but important elements of the pact were used in later Belgian state reforms. The pact was agreed in 1977 between the majority parties of the government Tindemans IV, which was a coalition between CVP, PSC, BSP-PSB, Volksunie and FDF. It was named after the Egmont Palace in Brussels, where the negotiations took place. The pact was supplemented with the \\"Stuyvenberg agreement\\" later the same year. Both would be called the \\"Community pact\\". Content The Egmont pact covered agreements on a number of various topics: * The establishment of autonomous councils and executives (a government) for the three communities in Belgium (which followed the establishment of the three Cultural Communities in 1970 - Flemish, French and German), next to the establishment of three Regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia), also with autonomous councils and their own executives. * An agreement on the linguistic relations in Brussels and its periphery, with the inscription right in Brussels for French speakers from 14 Dutch-speaking municipalities around Brussels. This would give them language facilities and the right to vote in Brussels. * A reform of the country's institutions. Failure The agreement was not put into practice as there was an immediate protest from the Flemish side. Especially the points on Brussels, with the end of institutional equality between French and Dutch speakers, were unacceptable for a lot of Flemings. The advice on the law that would have put the Egmont pact in practice was, on a number of points, heavily criticised by the Council of State. Resistance against the pact rose within the CVP, and more and more MPs demanded new negotiations. These were refused by the French-speaking parties. The CVP remained divided. On October 11, 1978, in an emotional speech, PM Leo Tindemans unexpectedly announced the resignation of his government. Consequences The Egmont crisis had consequences for some Belgian parties. The radical right wing from the Volksunie separated itself, leading to the creation of the far right Vlaams Blok political party. One of the last unitary parties in Belgium, the socialist BSP-PSB, was split into a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking party. The last remaining unitary party being until today the PVDA-PTB. Although the Egmont pact itself failed, it was an important exercise towards the federalisation of Belgium. Much of the Egmont pact have been carried out (see Communities, regions and provinces of Belgium). Other points were realised much later on, such as the division of the electoral district Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde and to some extent the rights for French speakers in the Brussels Periphery.

Lloyd and his crew honed and perfected their \\"thrill\\" filming techniques in this film, and put them to use in the 1923 feature Safety Last!  Plot  Harold works in an office on a tall building next to his girlfriend Mildred (Mildred Davis). He assumes they will be married, but overhears her talking to a man who says to her, \\"Of course I will marry you.\\" Distraught, he decides to commit suicide, blindfolding himself and setting up a gun which will fire when he pulls a string attached to the trigger. But after putting on the blindfold he accidentally knocks over a bulb which pops, and he assumes he has shot himself. At that moment, a girder from the next door construction site swings into his office, lifting him and his chair outside. Pulling off the blindfold, the first thing he sees is a sculpture high on his building which he takes to be an angel, and he assumes he is in Heaven. However a jazz band on an adjacent rooftop garden soon disabuses him of that notion, and he realises he is high above the city. After several perilous escapades high on the construction site, he finally makes it to the ground, only to realise that the man Mildred was talking to was her clergyman brother, who has agreed to officiate at their wedding.

During the 1970s, the company produced the popular and inexpensive CCM Targa road bike, as well as higher-end road bikes including the Silver Ghost and the Campagnolo-equipped (custom built) Tour du Canada.Smith, Ken (1972). The Canadian Bicycle Book (page 29) (D.C.

Although its numerical name was designated during the First World War, the 1st Battalion can trace its lineage back to 1854, when a unit of the Volunteer Rifles was raised in Sydney, New South Wales. This unit has since been redesignated a number of times, but through its links with the units of the colonial NSW defence force, the battalion's history includes services in Sudan and South Africa. During the First World War, the 1st Battalion was raised for overseas service in 1914 as part of the First Australian Imperial Force. Attached to the 1st Brigade, the battalion served in Egypt initially before taking part in the fighting in Gallipoli against the Turks. Later the battalion was sent to the Western Front where it fought in the trenches in France and Belgium as part of the Australian Corps. Following the end of the war the battalion was disbanded in 1919. In 1921, the battalion was reformed as part of the Militia as the \\"1st Battalion (East Sydney Regiment)\\". Throughout the interwar years the unit's designation changed a couple of times and for a time it was amalgamated with the 19th Battalion. During the Second World War the battalion served as garrison force in Australia before being disbanded in 1944 due to manpower shortages. Following the war the 1st Battalion was not re-raised until 1957 when it was reformed as a commando unit in Sydney as the \\"1st Infantry Battalion (Commando) (City of Sydney's Own Regiment)\\" before being reduced to a company-sized element in the Pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. In 1965, the battalion was reformed as the non-Pentropically established \\"1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (Commando)\\". It maintained the commando role until 1971 when it was amalgamated once again with the 19th Battalion to become the 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit of the Australian Army Reserve that remains in existence today. History=Lineage Although the 1st Battalion was not technically established until 1914, the unit takes its lineage from units that were raised in Sydney, New South Wales sixty years before then. Indeed, the 1st Battalion was the oldest infantry battalion from New South Wales and is a successor unit of the Sydney Volunteer Rifles which were raised in 1854 in the then colony of New South Wales in response to concerns about possible threats posed by Russian naval forces in the Pacific during the Crimean War. Following that the unit went through a number of changes in composition and designation as the various colonial defence forces were reorganised during the mid to late 19th Century. By 1860 the unit had become known as the \\"Sydney Battalion\\", but in 1878 following the decision to introduce a system of partial payment for volunteer soldiers, the unit was absorbed into the 1st Regiment of New South Wales Volunteer Infantry. In 1885, the 1st Regiment provided a detachment of one officer and 75 men to serve in Sudan during the Mahdist War, for which they received the battle honour \\"Suakin 1885\\". During the Second Boer War 12 officers and 91 men from the regiment served in South Africa as part of the New South Wales contingent, for which they were later recognised with the battle honour of \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\". Following Federation the regiment became the 1st Australian Infantry Regiment. A system of universal training was introduced in 1911. Due to the large increase in the size of the Army the existing regiments were reorganised and redesignated. As a result, the regiment was split into three units‚Äîthe 21st, 24th and 26th Infantry. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War the decision was made to raise an expeditionary force known as the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) which would exist alongside the Militia units that already existed.Grey 2008, p. 85. This was largely because the provisions of the Defence Act 1901 prohibited sending conscripts overseas to fight, but was also in part due to the need to maintain a military presence in Australia in case of emergency or attack while the 1st AIF was deployed overseas. Although initially there were limits placed upon the numbers of militiamen that could enlist as there was a requirement to man coastal defences and guard vital installations,Scott 1941, p. 197. large numbers of militiamen did enlist and were largely allocated to AIF units based upon locality. As a result, many of the AIF units became associated with the Militia units from where they were located and to some extent there was an attempt to maintain the identity of these units within the AIF. Up to 100 men from the pre-war 1st Infantry Regiment are believed to have served in various AIF units during the war, including the 1st Battalion. Some prominent members include William Holmes, Sydney Herring and James Heane. Among the units raised by the AIF, the 1st Battalion was one of the first infantry units raised in New South Wales, being formed at Randwick in Sydney in August 1914, within the first fortnight of the war. After a brief period of basic training the 1st Battalion was among the first Australian troops to be deployed overseas, arriving in Egypt on 2 December 1914. Alfred Shout, one of the 1st Battalion's Victoria Cross recipients, at Quinn's Post, Gallipoli, on 7 June 1915. After undertaking further training and serving in a static defence role around the Suez Canal, the battalion took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore with the second and third waves on 25 April 1915. Following the initial battle for the heights overlooking the beachhead in which the battalion took part in the attack on the hill known as Baby 700, the Turks regained control of the heights and the battalion was forced to withdraw to Russel Top and then later to the southern flank near Gaba Tebe. On 27 April, the battalion carried out a desperate bayonet charge for which one of the battalion's officers, Alfred Shout received a Military Cross and was Mentioned in Despatches. In August, the Allies went on the offensive on the Gallipoli peninsula launching the August Offensive. As part of this offensive, the 1st Division was called upon to launch a diversionary attack on Lone Pine. It was during this battle that the battalion took part in arguably its most notable engagement of the campaign. The attack began early on 6 August and after only an hour, the Australians had captured the Turkish positions at Lone Pine. The Turks counterattacked almost immediately and for the course of the next three days the fighting continued, during which time two members of the battalion, Alfred Shout and Leonard Keysor, performed acts of valour for which they were later awarded the Victoria Cross.McCarthy 1983, pp. 582‚Äì583. The Allies evacuated Gallipoli in December 1915 and the 1st Battalion returned to Egypt. While in Egypt the AIF underwent a period of expansion and re-organisation, during which time a number of men from the 1st Battalion were transferred to the newly formed 53rd Battalion. In early 1916, the AIF's infantry divisions were sent to France where over the course of the next two-and-a-half years they would take part in the fighting against the Germans on the Western Front. An Australian Chaplain delivering the sermon at the unveiling of memorial to the 1st Australian Battalion, Pozieres The battalion's first major action in France was at Pozi√®res in July 1916. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter. At Bullecourt in May 1917, George Howell became the third member of the battalion to receive the Victoria Cross. In 1918, the 1st Battalion helped to stop the German spring offensive in March and April before taking part in the Hundred Days Offensive that was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918 and ultimately brought an end to the war. The battalion remained in the line until late September 1918, when they were withdrawn from the front along with the rest of the Australian Corps for rest and retraining in anticipation of further operations. On 21 September all but one member of \\"D\\" Company refused to take part in an attack as a protest against the battalion being sent back into combat when it had been about to be relieved. The members of the company were subsequently imprisoned for desertion; this was the AIF's largest incidence of \\"combat refusal\\" during the war and formed part of a general weakening in the force's discipline due to the stresses of prolonged combat.Stanley 2010, p. 209 The battalion was out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities, the process of demobilisation began and slowly the battalion's numbers dwindled as its personnel were repatriated to Australia. They were finally disbanded in May 1919. Throughout the course of the war, the 1st Battalion suffered a total of 1,165 men killed and 2,363 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: three Victoria Crosses, two Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, seven Distinguished Service Orders with one Bar, 40 Military Crosses with one Bar, 29 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 131 Military Medals, nine Meritorious Service Medal and 57 Mentions in Despatches. Inter war years In 1918, the pre- war Militia units were re-organised once more into multi-battalion regiments. It was decided that the reconstituted regiments would be numbered after AIF battalions and that each would comprise three to six battalions with the first battalion being formed from inactive ex-AIF soldiers, members of the Citizen Military Force forming the second and senior cadets forming the third. As a result of this, the 21st Infantry Regiment was re-designated as the 1st Infantry Regiment. A further review of defence requirements was carried out in 1920, after which it was determined that the Militia should be further reorganised to perpetuate the battle honours and designations of the AIF.Grey 2008, p. 125. On 1 April 1921 the AIF was officially disbanded and a month later the new organisation of the Militia was adopted. As a part of this reorganisation, the Citizen Force battalion of each regiment was separated and adopted the numerical designation of the AIF battalion with which it was associated, as well as its unit colour patch and battle honours. Officers from the 1st/19th Battalion, November 1932 As a result of this the 5th Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment was redesignated the 1st Battalion and was attached to the 9th Brigade, 2nd Division. In 1927, territorial titles were introduced and the battalion officially adopted the designation of 1st Battalion (East Sydney Regiment), which it had unofficially used since 1921. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Forces would be maintained on a part-time, voluntary basis only.Grey 2008, p. 138. It was also renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time.Palazzo 2001, p. 110. The decision to suspend compulsory training, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units.Keogh 1965, p. 44. On 1 July 1930, the 1st Battalion was amalgamated with the 19th Battalion, later adopting the title of the 1st/19th Battalion (City of Sydney's Own Regiment). The two battalions remained linked until 1939 when due to the prospects of war a number of Militia battalions were delinked in preparation for an expansion of the Army. For a brief period after this the battalion was known as the 1st Battalion (City of Sydney Regiment), however, this was short lived as it was soon amalgamated once more, this time with the 45th Battalion.Festberg 1972, p. 58. Second World War and later With the outbreak of the Second World War once again the government made the decision to form an overseas expeditionary force outside of the pre-existing Militia units.Grey 2008, p. 146. In order to maintain the ability of the Army to defend Australia should Japan enter the war, it was decided once again to limit the number of militiamen that were allowed to enlist in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) to roughly one quarter.Grey 2008, pp. 145‚Äì147. While the units of the 2nd AIF were sent overseas to England, North Africa and the Middle East, the militia remained in Australia to carry out various garrison duties and training in order to improve the nation's overall readiness. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941 this changed and over the course of 1942‚Äì45 many Militia units were mobilised and deployed to fight in New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and Borneo.Grey 2008, pp. 178‚Äì184. In any case over 207,000Grey 2008, p. 183. militiamen transferred from the Militia to the AIF throughout the course of the war. As a result of this, and the serious manpower shortages experienced by the Australian economy from October 1942 onwards eight Militia battalions were disbanded while another eleven more were broken up and their personnel distributed to other units.Grey 2008, p. 184. The 1st/45th Battalion was one of the battalions that were disbanded, doing so in 1944 having not deployed overseas. Prior to this, though, the battalion was reorganised in August 1942 with its machine gun company being transferred to form the 6th Machine Gun Battalion along with several other Militia machine gun companies.Morgan 2019, p. 5. After World War II the Citizens Military Force was reformed in 1948, although the 1st Battalion was not re-raised at that time. In 1957, it was decided to expand the 1st Commando Company as a full battalion named the 1st Infantry Battalion (Commando), City of Sydney's Own Regiment. When the CMF was reorganised in 1960 along Pentropic lines this unit was once more reduced to company size, forming No. 1 Commando Company (The City of Sydney Company), 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. In 1965, when the Pentropic establishment was discontinued this company was once again raised to a full battalion sized unit, forming the non-Pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (Commando). The battalion maintained the commando role until 1971 when it was amalgamated with the 19th Battalion to become 1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains in existence today and perpetuates the honours of the 1st Battalion and its predecessor units as well as that of the 19th Battalion. The 1st Commando Company was subsequently re-raised as a separate unit and later subsumed into the 1st Commando Regiment.Shaw 2010, p. 11.

Newmeyer and Sam Taylor and starring Harold Lloyd. Directed by Fred Newmeyer and Sam Taylor, it features three episodes in the life of Hubby (Lloyd) as he struggles with domestic life with Wifey (Jobyna Ralston) and his in-laws. Plot Lobby card for the film Episodic in nature (effectively three short films merged into one), the first episode features Hubby winning a live turkey in a raffle and taking it home on a crowded streetcar, much to the chagrin of the other passengers. The second features Hubby grudgingly taking the family en masse out on his brand new Butterfly Six automobile, and the third is an escapade with his sleepwalking mother-in-law. The third segment almost qualifies the film as a horror movie, as in it, Hubby mistakenly believes he has killed his mother-in-law, and when she starts sleepwalking later, he thinks she's a ghost haunting him. Cast *Harold Lloyd as Hubby *Jobyna Ralston as Wifey *Josephine Crowell as Her Mother, Winnifred Ward Stokes *Charles Stevenson as Her Big Brother, Charley Stokes *Mickey McBan as Her Little Brother, Bobby Stokes *Evelyn Burns as Bit Part (uncredited) *Andy De Villa as Glen Reed (uncredited) *Edgar Dearing as Motorcycle Cop (uncredited) *Pat Harmon as Bus Straphanger in Spider Gag (uncredited) *Fred Holmes as Man (uncredited) *Billy Rinaldi as Brunette Boy on Trolley (uncredited) *George Ward as Blonde Boy on Trolley (uncredited) *S.D. Wilcox as Gene Kornman (uncredited) Production The film is a light comedy with minimal character development, and followed Lloyd‚Äôs early 1920s pattern of alternating what he called ‚Äúgag pictures‚Äù with ‚Äúcharacter pictures‚Äù. Some distributors had complained about the length of his previous elaborate feature Girl Shy, and Hot Water was the response. Its storyline was also interesting as a unique departure from most of Lloyd‚Äôs 1920s features, because his character was married with a family, and was not striving for success, recognition, or romance. It was popular at the box office and grossed $1,350,000, an excellent return for a film of the period. The fictional \\"Butterfly Six\\" was in reality a 1923 Chevrolet Superior Sedan. Renewed interest in Harold Lloyd In 1962, the \\"live turkey\\" and \\"Butterfly Six automobile\\" sequences were included in a compilation film produced by Harold Lloyd himself entitled Harold Lloyd's World of Comedy. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and created a renewal of interest in the comedian by introducing him to a whole new generation.

Murders Smith gained entry to Byfield's property on the pretext of wanting to buy cannabis. He shot Byfield three times in his living room, using a 9mm semi-automatic. The victim grabbed a bicycle which he attempted to throw at Smith, though his body ended up entangled in the frame. Toni-Ann had been getting ready for bed at the time. She entered the room and was shot once in the back as she attempted to flee. Trial In court, Smith had denied the murders, claiming another man had admitted being the killer to him. After being found guilty Smith was jailed for life for both murders, with a recommendation that he should serve at least 40 years before being considered for parole. As a result, he is likely to remain in prison until at least 2045 and the age of 72. This sentence is one of the longest recommended minimum terms ever made by a judge or politician in England and Wales. Bertram Byfield Bertram Byfield had been jailed in 1997 for dealing in crack cocaine. Despite his criminal background Toni-Ann, who was living under the care of Birmingham Social Services, had been allowed to visit him at his bedsit in an ex-offenders' hostel. As well as serving time in prison Byfield, who was also known as Tony or Blacka, is believed to have been affiliated to a Jamaican drugs cartel. He had survived an attempt on his life in 2002 when he was shot six times. Bertram Byfield had believed he was Toni-Ann's father. However, post-mortem examinations revealed he was not. Toni-Ann Byfield Toni-Ann was staying with Bertram Byfield when they were killed. At the time of her death, she was in the care of Birmingham Social Services, who had placed her in the care of a foster family. However, when the family went on holiday, she was left with a friend of Byfield's, and was allowed to stay in Byfield's bedsit for the weekend. Toni-Ann was seven years old at the time of her death. She was born in Jamaica but raised in the United Kingdom for most of her life. Her mother, Rosalyn Richards, did not emigrate to the UK with Toni-Ann and Byfield, but arrived in the UK soon after the murders to make an appeal to the public to assist in finding the killer. While she was in the UK, she claimed asylum but her request was rejected and she is due to be deported. The murder provoked outrage around London and brought criticism of Birmingham Social Services to the fore. The Department of Social Services, when dealing with children, has a policy of taking the wishes of the child into serious consideration, and holds the position that placing the child with parents or other relatives is preferable to a foster family. Toni-Ann, through her own admission, was very close to Byfield and had expressed a desire to be with her \\"father\\". However, criticism was made of Birmingham Social Services for failing to take into account that Byfield had recently served a prison sentence for a drug offence and was believed to still be involved in the drug trade. The murder forced the police, media and consequently public to take a more focused stand on gun crime, which has become an important issue since. This case, together with a number of others including that of Victoria Climbi√©, also raised questions about the failings and limitations of Social Services departments.

The name of the village may be derived from brest, the Slovak word for elm, a tree which used to be common in the area. History Brestovany was first mentioned in a document called Zoborsk√° listina from 1113, where it is referred-to as Bristem. In 1241 the village had to face an invasion of Tatars. Another difficulty came in 1271 when the Czech army conquered Trnava and its surrounding for some time. Brestovany became hereditary property of the town Trnava as of 1280, rendering its inhabitants serfs till the 1848 abolition of serfdom. In 1533 the village was invaded by the Ottoman empire, who plundered and burned it to the ground. In the 18th century the Chapel of Saint Martin and the Church of Saint John the Baptist were built there. In 1811 and 1818 fires seriously destroyed large parts of the village. As of 1824 Brestovany belonged to Polish count Jozef Saryusz Zamoyski, who had built a neoclassical mansion there, which now houses a primary school. Later it belonged to another Polish noble, Albert Wielopolski. Both noblemen are buried at the local cemetery. Culture and social life There are several remarkable historic buildings in Brestovany: the baroque Chapel of Saint Martin (1767), the baroque Church of Saint John the Baptist (1772) and the neoclassical manor house with a large park built in 1826. The village's organizations include a hunters' association, a carrier-pigeon breeders society, a volunteer fire brigade, a sport club and several choirs.

Finlay has released eight recordings in Europe and Canada, including one duo album recorded with Christoph Schellhorn as MFCS. Finlay's first-ever single \\"zensong\\" reached #2 on the Australian Independent Radio Charts in 2004,. His latest solo album New Harbour was written and recorded in New Harbour, Newfoundland, St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland and Chemnitz, Germany and was released on December 1, 2015. Early life Morgan Finlay is an Irish-Canadian singer- songwriter from North Vancouver, British Columbia, currently residing in Sevilla, Spain. He began performing musically at the age of five, and from 1984 to 1991 he competed in the Kiwanis Music Festivals in Vancouver, both individually and with ensembles. In 1986 he sang in both the Vancouver Opera‚Äôs performance of The Magic Flute, and the Canadian premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber‚Äôs Requiem. The following year he sang in the Vancouver Opera's The Cunning Little Vixen. In 1992 his acapella group The End won the Canadian Youth Talent Search, and represented Canada at the international finals in Memphis, Tennessee, where they tied for 7th place. With Finlay in The End was Trevor Guthrie, future member of soulDecision and co-writer/performer of \\"This Is What It Feels Like\\"‚Äô, with Armin Van Buuren. Style Much of Finlay‚Äôs music is in a singer-songwriter style, with overtones of folk, roots, and country. Among his musical influences he has cited Mark Knopfler, Sufjan Stevens, Eddie Vedder,Bruce Cockburn and JJ Cale. Career=Early career At the beginning of his professional musical career, Finlay moved from Vancouver to Montreal, hoping to pursue a life as a solo musician. He soon recognized that Toronto was the place to be, and moved there in the summer of 2002. While in Toronto he met and played acoustically for Canadian producer Matt DeMatteo, who subsequently decided to work on Finlay‚Äôs debut EP. DeMatteo, who had previously worked with Edwin, Big Wreck and Ashley MacIsaac, introduced him at the time to Peter Murray, who became his regular bassist until 2010. Uppercut EP (2002) release and Ontario/Quebec shows Finlay released his first solo EP, Uppercut, on October 1, 2002. The six-track EP was released independently on his own record label, Brisco Bodai Productions, and covered a variety of styles including rock, acoustic, and funk. The EP's single \\"zensong\\" achieved airplay on the CBC and on various college and internet radio stations during 2003 and 2004. \\"zensong\\" also peaked at #22 in the CFBX Kelowna Top 30. With Uppercut, Finlay began to perform on the local Toronto scene, and in January 2003 he began touring the Ontario college campus circuit. In the two years following Uppercut‚Äôs release, Finlay played in clubs in Toronto and Montreal, in festivals across Ontario and at multiple campuses across Ontario and Quebec. He also opened for Tom Cochrane and Sass Jordan at Windsor's Freedom Festival on Canada Day on July 1, 2003. Splice EP (2004) and first European tour Finlay's second EP, Splice, was in a more acoustic and stripped-down style than ‚ÄòUppercut‚Äô, and was released in early 2004. At this point Finlay was being recognized in the music scene in Toronto. In April 2004, the single from Uppercut, \\"zensong\\" was included on Daryl Hurs' Gen Sub records compilation, which was sent to contacts around the world. During this period \\"zensong\\"‚Äô achieved the #2 spot on the Australian Independent Radio Charts. Finlay‚Äôs track on the Gen Sub compilation CD was also heard by promoter Michael Schurr of Modern Noise in Mainburg, Germany. Following discussions between Hurs and Schurr in Berlin, a 19-day, 16-show tour of Germany and Austria was arranged for April 2005, which Finlay opted to perform solo. The tour was a success, and a second European tour in fall 2005 had been completely booked by the end of the summer. Disagreements arose between Schurr and Finlay, and beginning with the fall tour Finlay began being booked in Germany by Matte Vandeven of Sound of Liberation, and in Austria by Klaus Plewa of Ink Music. Everything Will Work Out Right (2005) In 2005, while still based in both Toronto and beginning to tour in Germany and Austria, Finlay released his first full-length record, Everything Will Work Out Right. The album was released internationally on both the Brisco Bodai and Sound of Liberation labels. Containing five songs from the Uppercut EP, and four songs from Splice, it also featured two songs which were recorded in Toronto with Justin Abedin on electric guitar, Chris Lamont on drums, and Peter Murray on bass. Finlay toured this album for nearly two years, beginning in the fall of 2005. In December 2005, Finlay opened for Roger Hodgson in Heilbronn, Germany. Shifting Through the Breakers (2007) and first recordings in Germany His second full album release, 2007's Shifting Through the Breakers, saw Finlay continuing with a contemporary rock sound. The album was recorded at SmartArts Studio in Moosburg, Germany, and was produced by Peter Murray, who once again played bass. The album included fan favorites \\"(in)Security\\" and \\"Blessing and Burning,\\" as well as Finlay‚Äôs first foreign-language singles, \\"Bei Dir Sein\\" and \\"Mourir d'envie'.\\" Finlay would tour in support of this album for nearly a year and a half, as he resided briefly in Berlin, and then in Bern, Switzerland while maintaining a base in Toronto.  Touring pause in Vancouver  By the end of 2008, constant touring had begun to take a toll. With his professional relationship with Sound Of Liberation effectively on hiatus, after his fifth European tour in the fall of 2008, he chose to return to Vancouver to take a break from touring and regroup. From 2002 to 2008, Finlay had performed nearly 400 shows in Canada, Germany, Austria, England, Scotland, Wales, Switzerland,[11][12] Slovenia, Croatia and the Netherlands. Finlay returned to Vancouver to live, worked in social work and maintained his touring connections in Europe, while writing demos and honing his home recording skills.  Fan involvement in his career  By the end of 2010, Finlay had written and recorded several demos. In December 2010‚Äî eight years after its release‚Äî he finished paying the recording and production costs of the Uppercut EP. Wanting to return to the road with a new album, but resistant to incurring brand new debt, he had arrived at a crossroads. Finlay had heard about Kickstarter from a friend who suggested that he consider crowdfunding to fund his album, and in the end decided to do a campaign on IndieGoGo.com, to raise funds to pay for the mixing and mastering of a new album, plus the costs of subsequently touring the album. The Latitude campaign was a success, and ended up 113% funded. During the 90-day campaign, Finlay decided to ask his fans to vote for their favourite demos, which would then be the songlist for Latitude. The response was enthusiastic, and fans chose 12 songs for the album from 17 demos, with Finlay choosing the 13th song. The final track order was created from this process. Finally, Finlay invited fans to make videos for the song of their choice from Latitude; their video would be featured on FinlayTV, his YouTube channel. Six videos were created for the album, and Finlay himself created videos for a final four songs. Latitude (2012) and the return to the road Finlay‚Äôs third full-length release, Latitude was officially released on January 1, 2012, and features performances by Dean Drouillard (guitar), Mike Olsen (cello), Brendan Hamley (drums), Marlow Holder (bass), Katheryn Petersen (accordion) and Jake Roeder (guitar). It is with Latitude that Finlay began to detach from his rock ambitions, and steer deeper into an acoustic folk direction. His return to the road was complete when the \\"Latitude Tour\\" officially began on March 19, 2012 in Mainz (a private show took place on March 17, for members of the MF Inner Circle in Wuppertal). The \\"Latitude Tour\\" totalled 16 dates in Germany and Austria. Fault Lines (2013) in Ireland After finishing his seventh European tour in the spring of 2013, Finlay moved to Ireland to work on a new album. In the face of the costs to make the new album, Finlay again launched a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo. In his second crowdfunding campaign, Finlay offered not only merchandise, but also guitar lessons, living room concerts and custom-written songs. The campaign was very popular, and ended up 161% funded. The album‚Äôs core writing and recording sessions were in Shanahill, County Kerry in the summer of 2013, and together with performances from Brendan Hamley, Igor Leonardi, Sam Bates, Jake Roeder and Martin Dietl, the album made a splash on its release in October 2013. Stylistically, it brought the simplicity of his acoustic folk into a more rootsy, alt-country direction and the upbeat songs were broadly welcomed by his listeners. Fault Lines was published in October 2013, and was officially released with a new tour that brought Finlay across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Still touring Fault Lines, he crossed the 500-show mark in October 2014 in Schwerin, Germany.  Foundations: MFCS (2015)  After performing at a house concert with Austrian guitarist Christoph Schellhorn in late 2013, Finlay and Schellhorn decided to make a record together, and for the purposes of the album and the subsequent touring, decided to name their collaboration MFCS. The album was unofficially considered a \\"best of Morgan Finlay\\", as it consisted only of songs composed by Finlay. This album also included a brand new Morgan Finlay song, \\"Let Me Down Gently\\" which quickly became a popular song in live performances. The album was released at the start of the MFCS \\"Brave Souls Tour\\" in April 2015.  New Harbour (2015) and fall tour  In June 2015, at the final tour stop on the \\"Brave Souls\\" Tour in Vienna, Finlay launched his third crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo, to finance the writing and recording of his sixth full- length album. The campaign lasted 45 days, and achieved its goal in under 30 days to end up 149% funded. Finlay traveled to Newfoundland in the end of July 2015, and wrote and recorded the first demos in New Harbour. Photos for the album book were taken in New Harbour, in Gros Morne Provincial Park, Trout River, Flat Rock and finally in St. John‚Äôs. The final recording sessions took place in Mount Pearl, where Finlay recorded performances by Aaron Collis, Darren Browne and Duane Andrews. New Harbour was officially released on December 1, 2015 with four shows in a row in Berlin. The album was made available as a digital album once again, continuing Finlay‚Äôs commitment to better sound quality (song files can be downloaded in FLAC, WAV and all lossless formats), and more and bigger images in the booklet. The \\"New Harbours Tour\\" included 38 shows in Germany, and 6 in Switzerland. Endorsements Finlay is currently endorsed by Seagull Guitars (Godin), and has an artist‚Äôs deal with D‚ÄôAddario Canada. Since 2009, he has also been supported by Dayton Boots, of Vancouver. Personal life Finlay is popularly seen as ‚Äòconstantly traveling‚Äô, and from 2000 to present has lived or stayed for extended periods of time in Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, Berlin, Bern (Switzerland), County Kerry (Ireland), and Sevilla. His working background includes years of social work in Vancouver and Toronto, in particular with special needs and mental health. Finlay is an avid cyclist, and champions various social and environmental causes.

Jorge Glusberg was the main leader associated with CAyC. In 1971, the \\"Grupo de los Trece\\" was created by Polish theater director Jerzy Grotowski. There were 13 artists who made up the group: Jacques Bedel, Luis Fern√°ndo Benedit, Gregorio Dujovny, Carlos Ginsburg, Jorge Glusberg, Victor Grippo, Jorge Gonz√°lez Mir, Vicente Lucas Marotta, Luis Pazos, Alfredo Portillos, Juan Carlos Romero, Julio Teich, and Horacio Zabala. Additional artists who later joined were Leopoldo Maler and Clorindo Testa. In 1975, the group were formally named the \\"Grupo CAyC.\\" The work was centered around the concept of \\"Arte de Sistemas\\" or Systemic Art. In 1972, the \\"Scuola de Altos Estudios del CAyC\\" aka \\"Escuela de Altos Estudios\\" / \\"Escuela de Altos Estudios del Centro de Arte y Comunicaci√≥n\\" was founded. In the seventies CAyC became an international center for the Pop art- culture and the famous Museo de Arquitectura. Well-known teachers at CAyC have included Justus Dahinden and Mario Botta.

Work on the building began in 1929, to a design by W. G. Davies. Built in a broadly Art Deco style, it was opened in 1934 by the Duchess of York (later The Queen Mother). Conceived as part of a plan by Patrick Abercrombie to create a civic square, it was the only element of that proposal ever built and so it faces onto a narrow street. In 1991, Tudor Square was constructed to one side of the library. The building, supported by a steel frame, is faced with Portland stone and has some decorative mouldings by Alfred and William Tory. It is a listed building at Grade II status. The art gallery contained within was founded around a bequest from J. G. Graves and hosts a range of temporary and permanent exhibitions. In January 2017 Private Eye reported that the building's owner, Sheffield City Council, planned to sell it due to expensive repairs being required following years of neglect.

He was probably a member of a well-to-do middle-class family of Ratisbon named Sachs. The excellence of his literary training is proved by his sermons which show more than common acquaintance with the ancient classics. From his knowledge of the usages of secular life, it may be inferred that he was of mature age before he entered the monastery. The first fixed date in Berthold's life is 1246, when the papal legate appointed him and David of Augsburg inspectors of the convent of Niederm√ºnster. One of his contemporaries, the Abbot of Niederaltaich, a reliable historian, speaks in 1250 of the great reputation that Berthold had in Bavaria as a preacher. Four years later the missionary trips of this preacher extended as far as the valley of the Rhine, Alsace and Switzerland. During the next ten years Berthold's apostolic labours led him eastward into Austria, Moravia, Bohemia and Silesia. In 1263 Pope Urban IV appointed him to preach the Crusade and Albert the Great was designated as his assistant. When speaking to Slavonic audiences, Berthold naturally employed an interpreter, just as St. Bernard, in his day, made use of an interpreter in Germany. Notwithstanding any difficulties that might arise as to speech, wherever he went Berthold exerted an extraordinary power of attraction over his hearers so that the churches were not able to hold the great crowds of plain people who came from all quarters to his services, and he was often obliged to preach in the open air. When this was the case, a pulpit was generally arranged under the spreading branches of a linden tree. Long after his day \\"Berthold's linden\\" was to be seen at Glatz. About 1270 he seems to have returned to Ratisbon where he remained until his death on 14 December 1272. He had fallen down all these stairs a few days prior. Reputation and sermons The Franciscan martyrology includes his name among the blessed of the order, and his remains form the most precious relic among the treasures of the cathedral at Ratisbon. It is recorded that he would preach to up to 100,000 people at one time. The poets and chroniclers of his time made frequent reference to Berthold. He was called \\"sweet Brother Berthold\\", \\"the beloved of God and man\\", \\"a second Elias\\", \\"the teacher of the nations\\"; all of these expressions are proofs of the high esteem in which his activities were held. The secret of the preacher's success lay partly in the saintliness of his life and partly in his power to make use of the language of humble life. He became the great master, it may be said, the classic of homely speech, and this rank has been maintained by his sermons to the present day. One of his two popular discourses on the Last Judgment became a favourite book of the people under the title \\"The Valley of Josaphat\\". There is no doubt that Brother Berthold preached in German. For a long time scholars disagreed as to how his sermons had been preserved. It is now generally accepted that the sermons were often written down afterwards in Latin, frequently with marginal comments in German; these reports of the sermons, as they may be called, partly German, partly Latin, or at times in the language in which they were delivered, are what have been handed down to posterity. The discourses thus preserved are of the greatest importance for the history of the development of the literature of homiletics; they are of equal value as rich sources for determining the condition of education and culture in the thirteenth century. It is difficult, therefore, to understand how this greatest of German preachers to the poor could have been forgotten for centuries. It was not until some of Brother Berthold's sermons were published in 1824 that attention was called to the eloquent Franciscan. Since this date, the enthusiasm for Berthold grew steadily so that he has become a favourite, both of Germanic scholars and of the historians of the development of German civilization. He is also regarded as the great pattern of homely pulpit eloquence.

The Alps event, being the more widely publicized and famous among downhill cycling enthusiasts, starts on the glaciated summit of Pic Blanc in Huez and descends to the valley bottom at Allemond, for a total of over 2,600 vertical meters (8530 feet) and a 20 km (12 miles) distance. The mass-start race is known for its fast speeds and winding turns over varying terrain, with hundreds of riders descending the mountain at once. Despite the inherent dangers, officials state that injuries are modest, and that the race is less dangerous than it may seem to outsiders. The course is designed to slow the riders down around tight curves and the width of the glacier at the race's start line allows the riders to spread out.  History  The Megavalanche race was the creation of mountain bike pioneer George Edwards, who was involved in creating some of the first downhill tracks in Europe. The first race, held in 1995, saw 400 riders in attendance. The race has been managed by Edwards since its inception, and is organized by his company, UCC. The exact route of the course may change from year to year, depending on terrain and weather conditions, taking riders between 20 minutes to over 1 hour to complete, but on average lasts 35-50 minutes. The 2007 race saw a significant increase in participants from outside France, likely driven by an increase in press coverage of the event. The 2013 race saw 2000 riders in attendance from over 30 countries. On November 11, 2018, Edwards issued a statement notifying participants that the 2018 R√©union Mega race was cancelled. He stated UCC race organizers had \\"taken note of the prefectural orders not to authorize the organization of the event\\", due to the yellow vests protests taking place across France. Megavalanche organizers announced in 2018 a series of races entitled the 'European Mass Start Series', including the Megavalanche race and other races dubbed 'Maxiavalanches' (using the same mass-start format), to take place in 2019. The winner of the series' races will receive travel, accommodations and entry fees covered for the Reunion Island Megavalanche race.  Race Format  Since 2014, the format of the event follows three main days: *Practice Day - Lifts and courses are open and free to anyone with a race plate. Riders are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the course. *Qualifiers - Riders run qualifying races consisting of six heats of about 250 riders. The resulting qualifier times are broken down into starting lines designated by a letter, with 'A' being the front. *Race Day - The top 25 riders from each Qualifier start the race. The following 25 from each qualifier then race in a similarly mass-started event called the 'Megavalanche Challenger'. Any riders outside these two categories are grouped into the 'Megavalanche Amateur', and the two 'Affinity' groups 1 and 2 where they can start at any time after the first two mass start races. Riders' times are recorded automatically by transponder chip.

The Spanish toothcarp (Aphanius iberus), also known as the Spanish pupfish or Iberian killifish, is a small, endemic species of fish in the family Cyprinodontidae. Its risk of extinction is one of the greatest of any Iberian vertebrate. Its limited range, coupled with the drastic population decline the species has suffered in the last two decades, has caused it to be placed on endangered species lists, both in Spain and internationally. Its conservation status in the south of the Iberian peninsula has notably worsened. A similar fish in the peninsula's south-east has been classified as an independent species, Aphanius baeticus. Aphanius saourensis is another similar species in Algeria. Description=Morphology This is a small fish, rarely more than in length. Females are longer than males of the same age. It has an oblong body and rounded fins. Its dorsal fin is underdeveloped with respect to the fish's girth. It has large scales, numbering 20 to 26 across the body at its widest point. It has obvious sexual dimorphism. The males are marked with bluish to silver-colored vertical stripes on the flanks and dark bands on the caudal fin. The females are generally greenish-brown with dark blotches distributed irregularly over their bodies; their fins are transparent and mostly unpatterned. Some populations, most notably those in Murcia,http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,365,a,0,m,2330&r;=ReP-14273-DETALLE_REPORTAJES have short, dark stripes as opposed to blotches. Reproduction The lifespan of a Spanish toothcarp is short. They reach sexual maturity at age three months. The females spawn repeatedly each season, producing from 100 to 900 eggs.http://www.mediterranea.org/cae/divulgac/peces/fartet.htm Toothcarps in the Murcia region tend to spawn between April and August, while more northerly populations, such as those in the Delta del Ebro, lay their eggs between May and August. Spawning is usually done in areas with nearby vegetation, which shelters the eggs. Hatchlings emerge approximately eight days after the eggs are laid. Females that hatch in April are able to reproduce in June. While the females spawn, adult males set up small territories that they defend from other males in ritualized combats through which they court the females. Behavior The Spanish toothcarp is an omnivore, and eats insects, crustaceans, worms and algae. Generally, toothcarps travel in small groups, staying near underwater vegetation, where they normally go unnoticed. The biology of the Spanish toothcarp is characterized by a high growth rate, early maturity, a high reproductive rate, multiple periods of egg-laying and a short lifespan. From an evolutionary ecology point of view, this lifestyle is highly adaptive for fish that live in unstable environments, such as estuaries, where unpredictable conditions increase mortality. This strategy allows the toothcarp to exploit environmentally favorable conditions during the short intervals in which they occur, thereby revitalizing the population.Vargas, M.J.; De Sostoa, A. 1997. Life-history pattern of the Iberian toothcarp Aphanius iberus (Pisces, Cyprinodontidae) from a Mediterranean estuary, the Ebro Delta (Spain). Netherlands Journal of Zoology 47, no. 2, pp. 143-160. Habitat Spanish toothcarp inhabit shallow, slow-moving bodies of water such as river-mouths, coastal lakes, and ponds. They occur in saline and fresh water alike, due to their ability to tolerate high levels of salinity: they are euryhaline. The Spanish toothcarp can tolerate temperatures of , and pH levels between 6.5 and 7.5. Despite their adaptability, they have been displaced by invasive species, such as both species of mosquitofish, introduced from North America to Spain in 1921 by doctor Sad√≠ de Buen Lozano in an attempt to control malarial mosquitoes.De Buen, E. ‚ÄúEstudio experimental de algunas sustancias larvicidas antianof√©lica‚Äù. Tesis doctoral. Medicina de los Pa√≠ses C√°lidos. 1929. Tomo II. en Fern√°ndez Astasio, B. (2002) The toothcarp has retreated to high salinity areas where the mosquitofish cannot live. Distribution The Spanish toothcarp is characteristic of the Iberian peninsula, and extends from the Aig√ºamolls of Alt Empord√† to Lake Agra in Almer√≠a. In the last two decades, the Spanish toothcarp has suffered a severe decline,(Moreno-Amich, R., M. Planelles, C. Fern√°ndez-Delgado y Garc√≠a-Berthou, E. (1999). Distribuci√≥n Geogr√°fica de los ciprinodontiformes en la Pen√≠nsula ib√©rica. Pp 33-57, en Planelles, M. (Ed.). 'Peces Ciprinod√≥ntidos Ib√©ricos: Fartet y Samaruc. Monograf√≠a. Generalitat Valenciana (Valencia).) due in part to destruction of suitable habitats. Only a few dozen isolated populations are known. They have been found in the alluvial plain of the Segura River, the Chicamo River in Abanilla, the wetlands surrounding the Mar Menor and Valencian Community (more specifically in the Parque Natural de El Hondo, and in the Parque Natural de la Albufera with its springs), the Parque Natural del Delta del Ebro in Tarragona, and the Albufera de Adra and the Adra River. Divergence between populations Phylogenetic relationships and genetic divergence have been observed in Iberian populations of Aphanius iberus by using isozymes along with the complete genetic sequence of chromosome B. The results for nuclear genes were consistent with those for mitochondria, and demonstrated that the Atlantic and Mediterranean toothcarp populations derive from separate lineages. The level of genetic divergence shows that they were isolated early and that gene flow has not occurred. The divergence between these two monophyletic clades is the same as that found between other species of pupfish. This discovery makes it necessary to separate the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations in order to protect their diversity and genetic identities.Perdices, A., Carmona, J.; Carlos Fern√°ndez-Delgado & Ignacio Doadrio. 2001. Nuclear and mitochondrial data reveal high genetic divergence among Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the Iberian killifish Aphanius iberus (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae). Heredity 87 (3), 314‚Äì324. Molecular analysis, together with morphometric data, has taxonomic implications. In fact, the populations of the Atlantic basin are so different from those in Europe that they have been recognized as a separate species, Aphanius baeticus. The species name Aphanius iberus is limited to populations that live in the Mediterranean.Doadrio, I; Carmona, J.A. & Fern√°ndez Delgado, C. 2002. Morphometric study of the Iberian Aphanius (Actinopterygii, Cyprinodontiformes), with description of a new species. Folia Zool. 51(1): 67‚Äì79 Conservation status Despite being distributed over a large area on the peninsula, the Spanish toothcarp is largely found in small, threatened areas. Because of this, the Spanish Ministero de Medio Ambiente lists it as an endangered species.http://www.mma.es/secciones/biodiversidad/especies_amenazadas/catalogo_especies/vertebrados_peces/pdf/ver1.pdf Among the threats are:http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/nuevaandalucia/agua/EL%20FARTET.htm * Water contamination by agricultural and urban waste * Habitat destruction, primarily from development * Introduced species such as Louisiana crawfish, mosquitofish and largemouth bass * Disappearance of channels and irrigation ponds * Stream bed contamination by accidental spills * Unintended consequences of combating eutrophication from algae, using toxic chemicals such as copper sulfate, or by covering them to prevent sunlight from reaching the water * Eutrophication from algae * Contamination of albuferas * Keeping them as pets once increased their decline, as they were highly valued by aquarists. This interest has recently shifted to more colorful tropical fish.

It was initially raised for service during the First World War as part the Australian Imperial Force and saw action at Gallipoli before being sent to the Western Front in mid-1916, where it spent the next two-and-a-half years taking part in the fighting in the trenches of France and Belgium. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in early 1919 as part of the demobilisation process. In 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Forces based in Newcastle, New South Wales, drawing lineage from a number of previously existing infantry units. They remained in existence until 1929 when, due to austerity measures during the Great Depression and manpower shortages, the battalion was amalgamated with two other infantry battalions over the course of a number of re-organisations. It was re-formed in 1939 and undertook garrison duty in Australia during the Second World War until 1943 when it was merged once again. Following the end of the war, the 2nd Battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force in 1948. In 1960, it was reduced to a company-level formation but was re-formed as a battalion of the Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1965. It remained on the Australian order of battle until 1987 when it was amalgamated with the 17th Battalion, to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains part of the Australian Army Reserve today. History=First World WarFormation and training= The 2nd Battalion was raised at Randwick, New South Wales, in August 1914 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which was formed from volunteers for overseas service shortly after the outbreak of the First World War.. Drawing the majority of its personnel from the Maitland, Newcastle and Hunter Valley regions of the state of New South Wales,. the battalion formed part of the 1st Brigade and, along with the 1st, 3rd and 4th Battalions,. it was one of the first infantry units raised by Australia following its entry into the war. Upon formation, the battalion was established with a complement of over 1,000 men organised into a headquarters, a machine-gun section of two heavy Maxim medium machine-guns, and eight rifle companies, each consisting of three officers and 117 other ranks... The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, a citizen soldier and Member of Parliament in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, who held the seat of Armidale.. Kensington, Sydney, October 1914 alt=A group of soldiers standing, kneeling or lying down in a group photograph The physical standards under which the first contingent of the AIF was recruited were very strict, nevertheless by the end of August over 20,000 men had been recruited into one infantry division‚Äîthe 1st Division‚Äîand one light horse brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade.. Following a brief period of training in Australia, the force set sail for the Middle East, assembling off Albany, Western Australia, in early November 1914 before leaving Australian waters,. with the 2nd Battalion embarked upon the HMAT Suffolk. Initially it had been planned that the Australians would be sent to the United Kingdom, where they would undertake further training prior to being sent to the Western Front in France and Belgium. However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, and as a result of this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans for the use of the Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.. The 2nd Battalion arrived in Egypt on 2 December. The following month, it undertook further training along with the rest of the 1st Division. The battalion was also re-organised into four companies,. as the Australian Army converted to the new battalion structure that had been developed by the British Army. Although the battalion's authorised strength remained the same, the eight companies were merged into four, each consisting of six officers and 221 other ranks. In February 1915, Ottoman Empire forces attacked the Suez Canal,. and although some units of the 1st Division were put into the line, the 2nd Battalion was not required, and in the end the attack was turned back mainly by Indian units. Later, in an effort to open shipping lanes to the Russians and also knock the Turks out of the war, the British high command decided to land a force on the Gallipoli peninsula near the Dardanelles using mainly British, French and Indian troops along with the Australians and New Zealanders.. =Gallipoli= During the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the 2nd Battalion, under Braund's command, came ashore in the second and third waves, landing a total of 31 officers and 937 other ranks.. Upon landing, the 2nd Battalion dispatched two companies, 'A' and 'D' to assist the 3rd Brigade who were pushing inland towards a high feature known as \\"Baby 700\\", which overlooked the beachhead.. One of the 2nd Battalion's platoons, under Lieutenant Leslie Morshead, advanced further than any other Australian unit, making it to the slopes of Baby 700, before a determined counter-attack by Ottoman forces drove them back in the afternoon.. alt=Soldiers sitting and standing in a trench covered by logs Meanwhile, the battalion's other two companies, 'B' and 'C', had been held back in reserve. In the early afternoon, Braund led them up the steep terrain under fire to the vital junction between two positions known as \\"Walker's Ridge\\" and \\"Russell's Top\\". The battalion proceeded to hold this position until reinforcements arrived from the Wellington Battalion two days later, at which time the 2nd Battalion undertook a bayonet charge which cleared the crest of Russell's Top.. A determined enemy counter-attack forced them back to the junction where they remained until 28 April when they were ordered into reserve on the beach. In early May, part of the battalion was sent to reinforce the 3rd Battalion. At around midnight on the night of 3/4 May, the 2nd Battalion's commanding officer, Braund, who was partially deaf, was accidentally killed as he attempted to visit 1st Brigade headquarters after failing to hear a challenge from a sentry, who shot him believing that he was an enemy soldier. Following his burial, the battalion second-in-command, Robert Scobie, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and took over as commanding officer. Following the initial establishment of the beachhead, the campaign moved into a second phase as the Australians began work to consolidate and slowly expand their position around the lodgement.. During this time, the fighting at Anzac evolved into largely static trench warfare.. In mid-May, however, the Turks decided to launch an attack on Anzac. This began late on 18 May with the heaviest artillery bombardment of the campaign to that point, during which the 2nd Battalion's orderly room, located on \\"MacLaurin's Hill\\", was hit.. The assault began the following day, during which the 2nd Battalion, established around a position known as the \\"Pimple\\", was attacked by elements of the Ottoman 48th Regiment who poured into their forward positions through \\"Owen's Gulley\\", which rose as a re-entrant between the 2nd Battalion's position and that of 3rd Battalion which was on their left at the \\"Jolly\\".. At risk of having the line split in two and enduring heavy attack in their sap head, the 2nd called for reinforcements which came in the shape of artillerymen from the 8th Battery, who were pressed into the line as infantrymen.. With only limited machine-guns and with bad light hindering the supporting artillery, the job of turning back the Turkish assault fell to the riflemen and by maintaining strict fire discipline, great effect was achieved.. By 24 May, the attack had been decisively defeated and a brief truce was called for both sides to bury the dead. Following this, the Ottoman forces around Anzac adopted a defensive posture.. It was during this time, that one of the 2nd Battalion's soldiers, Lance Corporal (later Sergeant) William Beech, invented the periscope rifle.. alt=A man in wearing a military-style cap kneels behind rifle that has been modified to be fired from behind the cover of a makeshift breastworks In early August, in order to create a diversion to draw Ottoman reserves away from a major attack at Hill 971, which had been conceived as part of an attempt to break the stalemate that had developed around the beachhead, the 1st Brigade conducted an attack at Lone Pine.. The 2nd Battalion was chosen to take part in the initial assault.. After gaining possession of the main enemy line, the Australians were subjected to a series of determined counter-attacks which would last the next three days, which, although successfully repulsed, proved very costly for the Australians.. The 2nd Battalion suffered considerably. Having started the action with 22 officers and 560 other ranks, they lost 21 officers and 409 other ranks killed or wounded.. Among those killed was its commanding officer, Scobie, who was shot dead while attempting to repulse a counter-attack on 7 August.. In Scobie's place, the battalion second-in- command, Major Arthur Stevens, who had been a second lieutenant less than 12 months before, took over as temporary commander.. Elsewhere, the main offensive which had been launched at Hill 971 and Sari Bair, and the fresh landings that had taken place at Suvla Bay, also faltered. Ultimately, the August Offensive, of which the fighting at Lone Pine had been a part, failed to deliver the Sari Bair heights to the British Empire forces and their allies,. nor did it break the deadlock. Following this, stalemate returned to the peninsula during September and October, and although small skirmishes continued, the Australians were mainly involved in defensive actions.. As a result of the setback, many of the strategic goals that had been the basis of the campaign were abandoned and as a bitter winter set-in in November, there was much debate among the British high command about the utility of continuing the campaign.. In the intervening months, some personnel had been shifted away from Gallipoli as other the situation in other theatres became more relevant, and in late November, Lord Kitchener toured the peninsula. Finally, on 8 December, the order to begin the evacuation was given.. The evacuation, which has been described as \\"more brilliantly conducted ... than any other phase of the campaign\\",. took place in stages, and with the maintenance of secrecy a key consideration, a series of \\"ruses\\" were used to conceal the withdrawal. Each unit left in drafts, maintaining a presence along the line until the very end. Finally, just before dawn on 20 December, the evacuation was complete.. A small element from the 2nd Battalion was among the last Australian troops to leave, with a group of 64 men remaining in possession of the \\"Black Hand\\" position until 2:50 am on the final morning.. =Egypt= Following the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the AIF returned to Egypt where they underwent a period of re-organisation.. Part of this saw the influx of large numbers of reinforcements and the expansion of the AIF. The 2nd Division had been formed in July 1915, and part of this had been dispatched to Gallipoli in the later stages of the campaign, but the large increase in volunteers in Australia meant that further plans for expansion could take place. The 3rd Division was raised in Australia, while two new divisions, the 4th and 5th Divisions, were raised in Egypt from reinforcements in holding depots and experienced cadre personnel which were drawn from the infantry battalions of the 1st Division.. In this regard, the 1st Brigade helped raise the 14th Brigade, with personnel from the 2nd Battalion being transferred to the 54th Battalion;. the split occurring while the battalion was at Tel el Kebir on 14 February. They were quickly brought up to full strength and training began shortly afterwards.. Earlier in the month, Stevens was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in substantive command of the battalion; he would subsequently lead them through to November 1916. Around this time, the units of the 1st Division, of which the 2nd Battalion was a part, became part of the larger I Anzac Corps, and in early March, this corps embarked for France ‚Äì the 2nd Battalion leaving from Alexandria on the SS Ivernia. ‚Äì where they were to take part in the fighting on the European battlefield.. =Western Front= After being landed in Marseilles,. they proceeded north by railway to staging areas near Hazebrouck.. Shortly afterwards, on 7 April, the units of I Anzac Corps were assigned to a \\"quiet\\" sector of the line near Armenti√®res to gain experience of trench warfare.. Due to concerns about a German attack, almost immediately the Australians set to work to improve the defences around their position.. It had been hoped by the high command to initially keep the Australian presence a secret in order to gain some advantage from it, however, on 23 April it became apparent that the Germans had become aware of their arrival when a signal lamp flashed a message in Morse code from the trench opposite the 2nd Battalion's position stating, \\"Australians go home\\". To this, the Australians, despite orders against responding, replied matter-of-factly, \\"Why?\\". In June, during a brief period away from the line in billets, the battalion, along with the rest of the 1st Brigade, was reviewed by the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes near Fleurbaix.. Following this, although several units from I Anzac Corps took part in a number of raids against the German line during late June and early July,. the 2nd Battalion was not involved and as such, apart from experiencing some enemy shelling, the 2nd Battalion's first significant action came at Pozi√®res in July 1916. The battalion entered the line on the night of 19/20 July as the 1st was sent forward to relieve the British 68th Brigade along with the 3rd Brigade;. just after midnight the 2nd Battalion, after an approach march over which they had endured gas attack, arrived at its position opposite the south-western side of the village.. On 23 July, following an intense artillery barrage,. the attack began. Leaving their form-up point near the \\"Chalk Pit\\", the 2nd Battalion, which had been allocated the position of the left forward battalion in the assault with the 1st Battalion on their right and the 4th Battalion following them up,. moved out into no man's land just after midnight. A short time afterwards a flare was fired from the German lines followed by sporadic rifle and machine-gun fire, which was directed somewhere away from the battalion's axis-of-advance. As they advanced over the broken ground, suddenly a sentry called out a challenge and the entire battalion froze, but when firing broke out it became clear that it was directed away to their right towards the 3rd Brigade who were advancing over open ground.. Advancing beneath the supporting barrage, under the direction of their officers whose job it was to ensure that they did not get ahead of the creeping artillery, the battalion probed forward trying to locate the enemy defences, finally finding an abandoned trench located amongst a group of tree stumps.. After striking the railway, they began to dig-in just beyond it to secure the left flank, as the 3rd and 4th Battalions passed between them and advanced to secure the brigade's front along the line of the main Bapaume road. Following this, the 2nd Battalion maintained the left-most position on the brigade line, with its pits curling around the left flank and folding in behind the 4th Battalion's position.. The Germans put in a determined counter- attack at dawn with a whole battalion, which was turned back after a stiff fight. That night, reinforcements were brought up from the 2nd Brigade, and early in the morning on 24 July the Germans opened up with a devastating artillery barrage.. On 25 July, the men of the 2nd Battalion, having suffered terribly in the open trenches, were relieved by the 7th Battalion.. During the operations around Pozi√®res, the battalion lost 10 officers and 500 men killed or wounded.. alt=Soldiers march along a sunken dirt road in small groups. Either side of the road debris is strewn and the ground has been churned up from recent artillery attacks After this, they were sent to Pernois for rest and re-organisation,. and after being brought back up to about two-thirds strength,. the 2nd Battalion's next involvement in the fighting came around Mouquet Farm when they were briefly put into the line on 18/19 August to provide reinforcement, before being quickly relieved a few days later.. In early September, I Anzac Corps was transferred from the Somme region to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest.. Taking up a position north of the Ypres‚ÄìCommines canal, the battalions of the 1st Division were placed in the centre of the line between those of the 4th, on the right to the south, and the 2nd on the left, to the north.. The sector was a relatively quiet one, although not without its dangers due to constant mortar attacks, sniping, and the need to maintain patrols in no man's land.. Nevertheless, duties in this time were focused mainly upon maintaining a defensive presence in the line and rebuilding the defences. In addition, a number of small-scale raids were also undertaken in an effort to draw some attention away from the fighting that was occurring on the Somme. On 6 October, in concert with three parties from the 1st Battalion, the 2nd carried out a minor raid on a German position to the north-east of a position known as \\"The Bluff\\" in order to gain intelligence. After encountering a German patrol, they were forced to abandon their attempt, however, a short time later, one of their own patrols captured a German soldier from the 414th Infantry Regiment in no man's land.. The next week, on 12 October, just after 6:00 pm a small party moved out into no man's land to raid another German position near The Bluff. After being spotted, they were subjected to several grenade attacks, forcing them to retire. Their covering force was already in position, however, and so a number of the attacking force joined them and together, at 6:30 pm, after a box barrage by the artillery had cut the wire in front of the German position, they entered it. Killing seven Germans, they overcame the enemy resistance and brought back two defenders as prisoners. On the way back, several of their own wounded became lost, although all except one of these men were later recovered. The other man, one of the officers, was later found to have died of his wounds. In total the raid had cost the battalion two killed and seven wounded.. After this, the units of I Anzac Corps returned to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion was not involved in any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade‚Äîspecifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd‚Äîput in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.. Winter began to set in at this point, and even though combat operations all but ceased during this time, the battalion endured considerable hardships amid snow and rain, in a sector that has been described as \\"the worst ... of the sodden front\\".. For a brief period during December, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Blamey commanded the battalion before taking over as acting commander of the 1st Brigade.. During this time, the battalion was reorganised as part of a wider-Army restructure that resulted in an attempt to increase the firepower of the each platoon. Earlier in the year, the battalion machine-gun section had been deleted and replaced by a single Lewis gun held within each company; by end of the year this had been increased to one Lewis per platoon.. alt=Portrait photograph of soldier wearing a medal shaped like a cross on his left breast. He is wearing a slouch hat and a greatcoat that is unbuttoned As 1917 began with the Allies making fresh plans, the Germans, finding themselves outnumbered and needing to shorten their lines, began a skilful staged withdrawal beginning in February and ending in April.. Falling back up to in some places, they took up positions along a series of heavily fortified, purpose-built strong-points which the Allies subsequently named the \\"Hindenburg Line\\", which, due to the reduced frontage, enabled them to free up some 13 divisions of reserves.. Following up the Germans, the Allies advanced towards this line, finding that the Germans had adopted a scorched earth policy as they had moved back; the result of this was that in order to establish their own lines, the Allies had to undertake significant construction work. Due to the shifting front line, the 2nd Battalion's first major engagement of 1917 did not come until 9 April when, on the periphery of the Arras offensive, they took part in an attack on Hermies, one of the outpost villages of the Hindenburg Line.. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Milligan, who had taken over on 17 March,. the battalion had departed Haplincourt at 7:30 pm the previous evening and marched to their form-up point. The plan was to attack with the battalion's four companies advancing side-by-side from the north-east to attack from behind the German defences, sweeping down on the village like a fan with the left-most company providing flank protection and establishing a series of posts to stop the garrison from escaping while the two centre and the right-most companies took the village. At the same time, two companies from the 3rd Battalion would attack the German main defensive position from the south-west.. In the end, the Australians were detected while waiting to step off and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack.. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost all of their officers, lost their formation and had to be re-organised before the attack on the eastern side of the village could continue. Sergeant Thomas Brew, no 714, was responsible for the reorganisation of the left-centre company and was recommended and subsequently awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his actions. The recommendation reads: \\"At Hermes on 9 April for his courage and initiative during our attack on the German position. Early in the action all his company officers were either killed or wounded with the assault such that the company and Brigade became somewhat disorganised. Sgt Brew skilfully took charge and boldly led his company through the village into the position they were to locate. On reaching his place in the line he personally reported to the nearest Co. Commander, and assisted materially in the work of consolidation.\\" The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east.. At the same time, on the right, the right- most company had advanced to the Doignes‚ÄìHermies road when they had begun to take fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there for almost an hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear just before dawn.. The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers.. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine- gun positioned near a sandpit on the other side of a road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross... Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00 am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.. The battalion played only a limited, supporting role during the 1st Division's repulse of the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt in mid-April,. and following this the battalion's next major action came in early May when it was involved in the Second Battle of Bullecourt. The day before the attack, the battalions of the 1st Brigade, despite being due for rest, had been attached to the 2nd Division, and they were subsequently employed to provide work parties to release reserves among the 2nd Division units to take part directly in the fighting.. Having not yet recovered its losses from the fighting around Hermies, and being subjected to artillery bombardment during their approach to the front, the 2nd Battalion entered the line on 4 May with just 16 officers and 446 other ranks,. subsequently relieving the 24th Battalion.. As the Germans attempted to force the Australians back, the 2nd Battalion was moved around a number of times to shore up the line, until units of the 5th Division came up to relieve those of the 1st Brigade on 8 May.. alt=Injured soldiers lie amongst debris while others walk past nearby The battalion's next major action came in mid- September when they were committed to the fighting around Menin Road, which formed part of the wider Third Battle of Ypres, in a supporting role. On 16 September, the battalions of the 1st Brigade relieved the 47th (London) Division around Glencourse Ridge,. located about east of Ypres,. holding the line until relieved on 18 September by the 2nd and 3rd Brigades who were to undertake the assault within the 1st Division's sector of the line. Following the assault, the 1st Brigade, including the 2nd Battalion, went forward on 21 September and secured the ground that had been gained. They were subsequently relieved shortly afterwards on the night of 22/23 September by troops from the 14th Brigade,. as fresh divisions were brought up to continue the attack at Polygon Wood.. The battalion's casualties during this time amounted to 11 officers and 188 other ranks killed or wounded.. After a brief period of rest, they returned to the line near Broodseinde on 1 October,. taking up a position near Molenaarelsthoek, on the right of I Anzac's position for the upcoming battle. The attack went in on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture their objectives.. During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded,. some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior to the attack, killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.. On 19 December 1917, after the battalion had moved to the relatively quiet Messines sector in Flanders along with the other Australian divisions following their involvement in the Passchendaele operations,. Stevens resumed command; Milligan having been elevated to the general staff. Stevens would subsequently lead them through until September 1918 when he was granted \\"Anzac leave\\" which allowed personnel who had enlisted in 1914 to return Australia for an extended period of leave. Throughout the winter, the Australian divisions remained around Messines, where they had been formed into the Australian Corps.. During this time, the brigades rotated through the line, taking their turn to man the divisional sector. The 2nd Battalion had spent Christmas at Kemmel before moving on to Wytschaete Ridge on 26 December. They stayed there until late January when they moved on to M√©teren.. In early 1918, the collapse of the Russian resistance on the Eastern Front enabled the Germans to transfer a large number of troops to the west. As a result, on 21 March, they launched an offensive along the Western Front.. On the opening day of the offensive, the 2nd Battalion's lines near Belgian Wood were raided by the 72nd Infantry Regiment and although the attack was beaten off, four men from the battalion were forcibly taken back to the German lines as prisoners.. The initial attack, coming along a front between La Bass√©e and La F√®re, was quite successful and with the Germans making rapid gains, the Australians were transferred to the Somme Valley where they were put into the line around Amiens to blunt the attack in early April... Shortly thereafter, during the Battle of the Lys, the 2nd Battalion, along with the rest of the 1st Division, were sent to Hazebrouck.. Upon arriving there on 12 April, they took up defensive positions around Strazelle to await the German advance.. On 17 April, while defending the village of Sec Bois, the battalion helped turn back a determined German attack.. Following this, between late April and July, a period of lull followed. During this time, the Australians undertook a series of small-scale operations that became known as \\"peaceful penetrations\\". After relieving the 3rd Brigade around M√©teren on 27 April, the battalions of the 1st Brigade began patrols on 30 April to capture German soldiers to gain intelligence and harass the enemy.. These were generally met with considerable success, although they were not without mishap. Two separate patrols were undertaken by the 2nd Battalion on 2 May. The first resulted in one officer being shot while attempting to enter a German trench, while the second resulted in another being shot by an Australian sentry who had not been warned that a patrol had gone out.. Later in May, they took up a position opposite Merris, remaining there until the end of the month.. Throughout June and July they alternated between Meteren and Merris during which time they continued to raiding operations, which advanced the line about without significant loss.. 8th August, 1918, by alt=Colour painting depicting a battle scene in which a line of soldiers advance on foot towards a ridge. To their right mounted soldiers move to the rear, while a tank is on the right In August, having gained the initiative, the Allies launched their own offensive commencing at Amiens on 8 August 1918, where the battalions of the 1st Brigade were attached temporarily to the 4th Division, to act as its reserve,. guarding the river crossing at Cerisy.. Following this they were involved in the advance through Chipilly and Lihons,. remaining in reserve until 11 August.. Throughout the period of the first week of the offensive, the battalion suffered three officers and 45 other ranks killed or wounded.. After this, the battalion continued operations throughout August and into September. On the night of 10/11 September, while around Hesb√©court,. the 2nd Battalion carried out peaceful penetration raids against German reserve positions around Jeancourt. Finding the village empty, they encountered a German patrol from the 81st Infantry Regiment, which was attacked and quickly overwhelmed. At noon the following day, they launched a larger attack with artillery and mortar support, destroying two German outposts to the south of the village, killing eight Germans and capturing 22 others.. In their last action, against the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18/19 September, the battalion suffered a further 77 casualties.. On 23 September the battalion was relieved by American forces.. At this time they were withdrawn from the line along with the rest of the 1st Division.. They would take no further part in the fighting. In early October, the rest of the Australian Corps, severely depleted due to heavy casualties and falling enlistments in Australia, was also withdrawn upon a request made by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, to re-organise in preparation for further operations.. On 11 November, an armistice came into effect, and as hostilities came to an end, the battalion's personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation and discharge. This was completed in May 1919. Throughout the war, the 2nd Battalion lost 1,199 men killed and 2,252 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, four Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, 20 Military Crosses, 21 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 58 Military Medals with two Bars, four Meritorious Service Medals, 55 Mentions in Despatches and five foreign awards. Inter war years and the Second World War The battalion was re-raised in Newcastle, New South Wales, in May 1921 as part the re-organisation of the Australian military that took place at that time,. with the battalion becoming a part-time unit of the Citizens Forces, assigned to the 8th Brigade of the 2nd Military District.. Upon formation, the battalion drew its personnel from three previously existing Citizens Forces units: the 2nd and 5th Battalions of the 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 13th Infantry Regiment,. and perpetuated the battle honours and traditions of its associated AIF battalion. As a result of this re-organisation, the battalion adopted the complex lineage of the 2nd Infantry Regiment, which could trace its history through a series of re-organisations back to the 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers (Newcastle Volunteer Rifle Corps), which had been raised in 1860. In 1927, territorial unit titles were introduced into the Australian Army, and the battalion adopted the title of the \\"City of Newcastle Regiment\\". At the same time, the battalion was afforded the motto Nulli Secundus.. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain the part-time military force on a volunteer-only basis.. In order to reflect the change, the Citizen Forces was renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time.. The end of compulsory training and the fiscal austerity that followed due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower available to many Militia units at this time was limited and as a result their frontage dropped well below their authorised establishments. Because of this, the decision was eventually made to amalgamate a number of units.. Subsequently, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 41st in 1929, forming the 2nd/41st Battalion, although they were later split in 1933 at which time the 2nd was merged with the 35th, becoming the 2nd/35th Battalion. Together these two units remained linked until 4 September 1939 when, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the 2nd Battalion was once again raised as a separate unit as part of an effort by the Australian government to hastily expand the Militia following the outbreak of the Second World War.. During the war, although mobilised and assigned to the 1st Brigade, the battalion did not see active service overseas and was instead used as a garrison force in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was merged once again with the 41st Battalion, forming the 41st/2nd Battalion. They remained linked until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as part of the demobilisation process. Post Second World War In 1948, Australia's part-time military force, under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), was re-raised. At this time, only two divisions were formed along with other supporting units.. The 2nd Battalion was one of those units that was re-established, returning to the order of battle in April 1948, as part of the 2nd Division. Between 1951 and 1960 a national service scheme had operated and during this time the CMF's numbers remained reasonably steady. However, in 1960 the scheme was suspended and the Australian Army was reorganised with the introduction of the Pentropic divisional structure.. As a result of this the CMF was greatly reduced and 14 infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six sequentially numbered multi- battalion State-based regiments. As a result of this, on 1 July 1960, the 2nd Battalion became part of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was reduced to a company-sized element of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), forming 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company).. Just prior to this, on 30 April 1960, the battalion had been afforded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle. In 1961, the Pentropic 2 RNSWR was entrusted with the battle honours that had been awarded to the 2/2nd Battalion, which had been raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force and which had served in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea. These honours would be retained by the 2nd Battalion throughout the rest of its existence. The Australian Army abandoned the Pentropic divisional structure in 1965, and in an attempt to restore some of the regional ties of the State-based regiments, a number of the regional companies of the State-based regiments were split and used to form new battalions with their traditional numerical designations. As a result, on 1 July 1965, 'C' Company, 2 RNSWR was used to re-raise the 2nd Battalion in its own right. This unit remained in existence until 1987, when further reforms to the Army Reserve led to a reduction in the number of infantry units across Australia and, at a ceremony held at Newcastle on 5 December 1987, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 17th to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, within the 8th Brigade.. Before amalgamation, the battalion's regimental march was Braganza, which was confirmed in 1953. Alliances The 2nd Battalion held the following alliances: * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey): 1929‚Äì59; * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment: 1959‚Äì60; * Canada ‚Äì The Queen's Rangers (1st American Regiment): 1934‚Äì36; * Canada ‚Äì The Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment): 1936‚Äì60.

Falco appears as the junior partner of Det. Joe Fontana (Dennis Farina) at the end of season 15 after Fontana's partner, Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin), is shot in the line of duty. He first appeared as Fontana's partner in the last four episodes of the show's 15th season while Martin took time off to film the movie Rent. Falco would later be the focus of the season 16 episode \\"Hindsight\\" when he is accused of murdering a woman. Characterization and production Imperioli was brought in to play Falco after Martin took a leave of absence. While Falco is characterized as a \\"loose cannon\\" type, he has been known to take extra precautions when interrogating suspects or executing warrants that sometimes annoy other detectives. A part-time law student, Falco tends to know more about the \\"fine print\\" of the law that could sink otherwise good-faith arrests. On playing Falco, Imperioli said, \\"I think what I find interesting is that the character of Nick Falco probably comes from a similar background as my character on The Sopranos; economically and geographically and kind of culturally. The differences: they're both Italian-American; they're both New Yorkers; they come from middle class backgrounds.... The character I'm playing on Law & Order, has a real passion for making the world safe and making the city safe for people. He wants to make sure that the bad guys go to jail and that justice wins out and I think he grew up with that reverence and lives with it.\\" Fictional biography Falco has two children, a boy (born 1999) and a girl (born 2002). He appeared again near the end of the 16th season, when a woman he brought home was found dead in his apartment's bathroom. Falco, in an effort to clear his name, tries to investigate the murder on his own, which taints the investigation Fontana and Green are conducting. Falco's name is later cleared; detectives learn that the murdered woman was part of a criminal gang which routinely committed robbery. The leader of the gang, the wife of an incarcerated criminal, had asked the woman to go home with Falco and put Rohypnol in his drink to knock him out. The woman was later murdered (by the girlfriend of another gang member) and left in Falco's apartment in an attempt to incriminate him. Her son was in on the sting to get her only to prove to the police and Falco that she did not do it. Reception Brian Holcomb of Slant Magazine did not regard the character in a positive light, noting that \\"Milena Govich's Nina Cassady...can be placed on the same trash heap as Michael Imperioli's temp job as Detective Nick Falco.\\" ReferencesExternal links Fictional lawyers Law & Order characters Fictional New York City Police Department detectives Television characters introduced in 2005 pt:Nick Falco ","title":"Nick Falco"},{"id":"6309514","text":"Safarali Kenjayev (18 February 1942http://www.labyrinth.ru/content/card.asp?cardid=28392 ‚Äì 30 March 1999) was a Tajikistani politician who served as the Speaker of the Supreme Soviet in Tajikistan 1991-1992, Chairman of the Tajik Parliament's committee on human rights and legislation, and as head of the Socialist Party of Tajikistan, which he founded.Tajikistan: Controversial figure killed RadioFreeEurope/RadioLibertyTajikistan Votes 2005 RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty  Early life  Kenjayev was born in 1942 in the Panjakent District. He was a member of the Yaghnobi community.  Career = Law  In 1965, Kenjayev graduated from Tajik State University with a degree in law. He started his career as a detective at the Public Prosecutor's Office. During his stint, Kenjayev was promoted to multiple positions, ranging from chief detective to deputy prosecutor of the Central Asian Railway.  Politics  After the 1991 presidential election, Rahmon Nabiyev elected Kenjayev as the chair of the Supreme Soviet and removed Qadriddin Aslonov from the position. In 1992, the CIS placed restrictions on demonstrations and freedom of the press. The CIS arrested the mayor of Dushabne, Maksud Ikromov on March 6, 1992. In a televised Supreme Soviet meeting in March 1992, Kenjayev discredited Mamadayaz Navjavanov, the Minister of Internal Affairs, by attacking Navajavanov's ability of breaking up protests. Navajavanov was accused by Kenjayev of discriminating against the Uzbek people in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). Kenjayev also questioned Navjavanov's Tajik ethnicity and insulted the Badakhshon population. After the meeting, the Supreme Soviet dismissed Navjayanov of his duties. The arrest of Ikromov and the dismissal of Navjayanov initiated the creation of the National Salvation Front alliance. The NSF sought for the ending of the Supreme Soviet and Kenjayev's resignation.Hiro, Dillip. On April 22, 1992, Kenjayev resigned from the Supreme Soviet, and was appointed in charge of the Committee of National Security (CNS). Kenjayev was then reinstated into the Supreme Soviet on May 3, 1992.  Tajikistani Civil War = Dushanbe protests  In protest of Kenjayev's reinstatement, protesters demonstrated outside the legislature building in Dushanbe on May 7, 1992. They called for Kenjayev's dismissal for his alleged corruption and mismanagement. As the civil war broke out, Kenjayev and other leaders formed the Popular Front of Tajikistan.Lansford, Tom.  Attempted coup  On 24 October 1992, Kenjayev led his army into Dushanbe, attacking the capital's presidential palace and parliament building. More than 150 people died. His forces, in control of the local radio station, proclaimed him the new president.Land Beyond the River: The Untold Story of Central Asia, page 174 After the coup, Kenjavey addressed the Tajik people, and said he would replace the leadership with a religious free government. Kenjavey also promised he would stop the civil war and restore the Nabiyev government. After two days of negotiations with the President of Tajikistan Akbarsho Iskandrov, Kenjayev and his troops withdrew from Dushanbe.

History The parish of Shepreth is roughly- rectangular and covers 1318 acres. It is bounded by the River Rhee to the north, which separates it from Barrington, Foxton brook to the east, across which lies Foxton, and Guilden Brook brook to the west, separating it from Meldreth and Melbourn. The field boundaries to the south border the parish of Fowlmere. Stone Age weapons and tools have been found in the parish, and the land, formerly marshy, could thus have housed a lakeside settlement. Evidence of Roman habitation has been found on the drier ground in the northeast corner of the parish. Two medieval moated sites in the village are scheduled as ancient monuments. Listed as Esceprid in the Domesday Book the name \\"Shepreth\\" means \\"sheep stream\\", and was used as a resting place where sheep could be washed on their route to Cambridge. The Sheep Bridge was still in use in 1626. Church The parish church of All Saints is an ancient edifice of brick and flint in the Early English style, consisting of nave and a low western tower containing two bells. The chancel arch dates from the early 12th century. There are some monuments to the Layer family (who formerly possessed property here) dated 1730, 1743 and 1760. There is also a 13th-century octagonal font of Barnack stone, and an old oak treasure chest which was unearthed about 1895. The grade II* listed church was restored in 1870, and affords 120 sittings. The register dates from the year 1569. There is a Congregational chapel, erected in 1901 and seating 120 persons. A stone cross was erected on Pretty Corner in 1920, in memory of the men from the parish who fell in the Great War. Village life The village has had its own station since 1851. Shepreth railway station is on the Great Northern Line, the main line between Cambridge and London. The parish contains a wildlife park, a nature reserve, Shepreth L-Moor, and the UK's only insect research laboratories. Shepreth now has two public houses, The Green Man at Frog End on the Cambridge to Royston road, and the Plough on the High Street. In the 18th century The Green Man was known as the Bottle and Anchor. The pub which is now known as The Plough burnt down and was rebuilt in 1896. The Railway Tavern by the station opened in 1873 and closed in around 1960.

Once one of Berlin's most important railway stations, it was severely damaged in World War II, and finally closed for traffic in 1952, when the GDR-owned Deutsche Reichsbahn rerouted all railway traffic between Berlin and places in the GDR avoiding the West Berlin area. The station's name lives on in the Berlin S-Bahn station of the same name, opened in October 1939 as part of the North-South S-Bahn link.  Construction  The 1841 frontage. Work to build the Anhalter Bahnhof began on 15 April 1839. As the Berlin terminus, of what become known as the Anhalt Railway, it opened on 1 July 1841 as far as J√ºterbog (the inaugural train being hauled by the very first Borsig locomotive), and extended to Dessau, K√∂then and beyond at later dates. It became known as the \\"Anhalt line\\" because it ran through the historical state of Anhalt, which in turn gave the new Berlin terminus its name. The network quickly grew to serve train services between Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and Munich. The front fa√ßade faced Askanischer Platz, which was basically a widened section of a street that at that time was known as Hirschelstra√üe (later K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe, Stresemannstra√üe, Saarlandstra√üe and today back again to Stresemannstra√üe), then a fairly ramshackle thoroughfare linking Askanischer Platz with Potsdamer Platz (and the Potsdamer Bahnhof), and with Berlin's old customs or excise wall () running down its centre. At the time of the Anhalter Bahnhof's construction there was no opening in the customs wall at this location, and so one was clearly needed so that travelers could get from city to station and vice versa. And so the Anhalter Gate was created in 1839-40, and bore a strong resemblance to architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel's Potsdam Gate up the road. A new thoroughfare, Anhalter Stra√üe, led from the gate into the city. The Anhalter Gate was one of four extra ones provided in the years after the customs wall's original erection, increasing the total number of gates around the city from 14 to 18. The customs wall eventually became redundant and was demolished in 1866-67, which allowed Hirschelstra√üe (newly renamed K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe), to be developed into a proper street for the first time.  Expansion Anhalter Bahnhof - the new train shed roof takes shape c. 1878 Like nearby Potsdamer Bahnhof, the Anhalter Bahnhof opened as a fairly modest building (behind administration block); the platform was just wide. However, as the German rail network expanded throughout the 19th century so did the Anhalter Bahnhof to handle the growth. In 1872, architect Franz Heinrich Schwechten (1841-1924) designed the vast new station that would also be the biggest in Germany and at the time the biggest in Continental Europe, though it was later surpassed. A temporary station was opened in 1874; the old one was demolished in 1875 and the new one begun in 1876. On 15 June 1880, the new terminus was opened by Kaiser Wilhelm I and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The new fa√ßade was 101 m across and embellished with zinc sculptures titled Day and Night by Ludwig Brunow (1843-1913), positioned on either side of the clock above the main entrance. Emil Hundrieser (1846-1911) was responsible for a sculpture on the very top of the fa√ßade called The International Traffic. Inside the building was a lavish and spacious booking hall with separate waiting rooms and facilities for no fewer than four classes of ticket holders. A separate entrance and reception area were provided for visiting royalty, and these saw frequent use. Behind all this, the huge iron and glass train-shed roof by writer and engineer Heinrich Seidel (1842-1906) measured 171 m long by 62 m wide (covering 10,600 m¬≤, under which 40,000 people could stand), and rose to 34 m in height along its centre line. The Anhalter G√ºterbahnhof (goods station), also opened, south of the Landwehr Canal on the same date as the passenger station. A 1900 view showing the front fa√ßade of the second Anhalter Bahnhof with Askanischer Platz and K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe, as it was then known Initially the rebuilt terminus was still handling train services mainly to and from Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and Munich, over the old Anhalter route. However, two years later it inherited a whole new range of services with the closure of the Dresdner Bahnhof. This terminus had opened on 17 June 1875, with trains to Dresden (over the so-called \\"Dresdener line\\"), Prague and Vienna, but was small and inconveniently sited some distance from the centre of the city, south of the Landwehr Canal. The Anhalter Bahnhof was more than capable of handling these services as well, and so on 15 October 1882 they were switched, and the Dresdner Bahnhof closed (its building actually still exists, next to the present Gleisdreieck U-Bahn station, having for many years served as part of a major mail-handling facility, itself since closed, called the Postbahnhof). This move was the key to establishing the Anhalter Bahnhof's ultimate importance, as the terminus became Berlin's ‚ÄúGateway to the South,‚Äù with services via Dresden not only to Prague and Vienna, but to places as far away as Rome, Naples and Athens. Next to the passenger terminus, was the Anhalter G√ºterbahnhof (goods station). The building, which had also been built by Franz Heinrich Schwechten, was located on the south bank of the Landwehr Canal immediately to the east of the parallel passenger lines. This artistic representation is Schwechten's own front elevation, showing the twin administration blocks linked by an attractive bridge structure, with three arches through which road vehicles passed into the so-called \\"ladestrasse\\" (loading road), wide. On either side were covered goods-handling areas some in length, with the railway sidings on the other side, to enable efficient movement of goods from railway wagons to road vehicles or vice versa. Since the early 20th century, the area around the Anhalter Bahnhof was popular with industrialists looking for a suitable location to build a nationwide cartel headquarters. The most renowned cartel of these was the German potash syndicate. Nazi Germany By the 1930s, trains left its six platforms every three to five minutes, carrying an average of 44,000 people daily (around 16 million a year, compared with barely 49,000 at Berlin Tempelhof Airport). Though still less busy than the Potsdamer Bahnhof up the road, the Anhalter Bahnhof was superior in its sheer scale, and in the opulence of its train services. Also by this time, the station was connected directly with the hotel which faced it across Askanischer Platz - the Hotel Excelsior, Europe's largest - by means of a tunnel, believed to be the longest of its kind in the world at 100 m, constructed in 1927-1928. The station had an underground arcade with five shops. However, despite its size and passenger numbers, the station was earmarked for redevelopment as part of Adolf Hitler's grand plan to transform Berlin into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania. Under the Nazi's plan, which was to be realised by Albert Speer, the building would have ceased to be a railway terminus because the new triumphal avenue known as the North-South Axis would have severed its tracks. All rail traffic arriving in Berlin would instead have been redirected to two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn. To the north of the city centre, would have been the Nordbahnhof (North Station) at Wedding and opposite to that would have been the S√ºdbahnhof (South Station) in S√ºdkreuz. According to Speer's plan, the Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool.  World War II  Ruin of the Anhalter Bahnhof, 1951. During World War II the Anhalter Bahnhof was one of three stations used to deport some 55,000 Berlin Jews between 1941 and 1945, about a third of the city's entire Jewish population (as of 1933). From the Anhalter alone 9,600 left, in groups of 50 to 100 at a time using 116 trains. In contrast to other deportations using freight wagons, here the Jews were taken away in ordinary passenger coaches which were coupled up to regular trains departing according to the normal timetable. All deportations went to Theresienstadt in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, and from there to concentration camps. Meanwhile, during World War II the Anhalter Bahnhof, like most of Berlin, was devastated by British and American bombs and Soviet artillery shells. A massive bombing raid on the night of 23 November 1943 badly affected the station, and caused so much damage to rail infrastructure further out that long-distance trains could no longer run, except for a few local services. Two further major raids on 3 February and 26 February 1945 left the terminus with large sections of its roof missing, the rest unsafe and tottering, and no trains running at all. Many sections of the S-Bahn as well as the U-Bahn were also closed during the war due to enemy action, and the section through Anhalter Bahnhof was no exception. Post war A fragmentary train service resumed along the North-South Link on 2 June 1946 once massive repairs were well advanced (water had to be pumped out at the beginning). Full services recommenced on 16 November 1947, although repairs were not complete until May 1948. The services were extended further in 1951. Another interruption of services was caused by the uprising of 1953 in East Germany, no trains running between 17 June, the day of the uprising, and 9 July. Meanwhile, above ground, American servicemen had dismantled the surviving sections of the Anhalter Bahnhof's roof in March 1948, and a limited train service had begun operating again in August, with a few trains running out into the Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg regions, but it was not to last. The station's final demise was caused by the rapid collapse of relations between the Allied Occupying Powers which controlled Berlin and Germany as a whole. The Anhalter Bahnhof was served by trains arriving from places in Soviet-controlled East Germany but the terminus was in West Berlin. Closure and demolition Remains of Anhalter Bahnhof, 2014 Due to its location, the Soviets switched all remaining trains to the Ostbahnhof in the Russian sector on 17 May 1952. With no services, the Anhalter Bahnhof was closed. Although detailed plans and an architect's model were drawn up to build vast modern terminus on the site, nothing happened. After lying derelict for more than eight years, with some tracks and signals still in situ, demolition was begun on 25 August 1960 and completed by 27 August despite considerable public outcry. Part of the centre portion of the fa√ßade was allowed to remain standing. Redevelopment The area around Anhalter has been significantly redeveloped since the 1950s. There is a memorial display board honouring the Berlin Jews taken from here and elsewhere to their deaths by the Nazis during World War II. The original \\"Day and Night\\" sculptures from the fa√ßade, photographed in 2003 in their new home, the German Museum of Technology. Day is on the right, gazing into the distance, while Night, on the left, is looking away. This view shows the rear of the fa√ßade remnant in 2005. In the left background is Europahaus, an office block dating from the early 1930s, while in the right background is the 18-storey Excelsiorhaus, on the site of the former hotel. It is not known whether the tunnel that once linked the station with the hotel still exists. In the foreground is a large new synthetic playing surface for sports where the train shed once stood. Immediately south, directly behind the photographer, is the Tempodrom. The Tempodrom, a major new concert and event venue opened on 8 December 2001, extends across the site of the terminus just south of the train shed's former location. Its innovative futuristic roof rises to a height of 37.5 m. Further south still, extending down to the Landwehr Canal, is an area of woodland, recently tidied up and new paths laid, but amongst the trees and undergrowth, several crumbling sections of platforms are still clearly visible. This location appeared on many picture postcards in the early years of the 20th century, and in some ways it has not significantly changed since then. The red-painted bridge side-on to the camera is a recent construction for pedestrians and cyclists, approximating in appearance the railway bridge which once crossed at the same spot. The main arch was once the centre span of three of a much older structure located elsewhere in the city - the Marschallbr√ºcke, built by Eduard Albert Paul Gottheiner in 1881-82, which carried Luisenstra√üe over the River Spree just to the east of the Reichstag. Concerns about its condition, coupled with the need to provide greater clearance for vessels on the river, brought about the replacement of the centre and south spans with one long new span in 1997-99, after which the old centre span was re-erected here as shown, as part of this new bridge designed by Benedict Toon and opened in February 2001. Just beyond it is where the S-Bahn North-South Link runs beneath the canal, and it was here that SS troops blew up the bulkheads in the last days of World War 2, deliberately flooding the tunnel in the hope of slowing the Soviet advance. The Anhalter Bahnhof stood out of the picture to the right (north). The buildings in the left background, on the south bank of the canal, house the German Museum of Technology. The other bridge, the higher one crossing the canal at a sharp angle, carries a section of U-Bahn line between Gleisdreieck and M√∂ckernbr√ºcke stations. The only surviving parts of the Anhalter G√ºterbahnhof (Goods Station) is its eastern administration block (on the left in the 1874 elevation). It is now restored and today the home of 'Spectrum', the Berlin Science Centre, another part of the German Museum of Technology. Its western twin was badly damaged in World War 2 and was demolished in 1959, the bridge structure following in 1963; the grey rendered area on the side of the building in this picture marks the bridge's erstwhile location. Down the former loading road on the right, the covered goods- handling area is now used mainly by a variety of small industrial concerns. Further down again is a large overgrown area of almost total desolation. Things are however looking much brighter at the adjacent Anhalter locomotive depot to the west, sandwiched between the Anhalter G√ºterbahnhof and the former Dresdner Bahnhof. After decades of dereliction its buildings have been restored and also incorporated into the German Museum of Technology.  Subway station  The idea for an S-Bahn North-South Link transversal rail line connecting the northern suburban lines terminating at Stettiner Bahnhof (\\"Nordbahnhof\\" since the early 1950s) with the southern suburban lines terminating at Potsdamer Bahnhof had first been mooted in 1892, ten years after the building east-west transversal line, the Stadtbahn connecting the Charlottenburg station and Berlin Schlesischer Bahnhof, but it was not planned in detail until 1928, and then approval had to wait until 1933, as part of Hitler's public works projects (Arbeitsbeschaffungsma√ünahmen) to pacify workers by reducing the high unemployment. The line to Anhalter Bahnhof, which was begun in 1934, opened in two phases. First the northern section from Stettiner Bahnhof to Unter den Linden, was inaugurated on 28 July 1936, just in time for the Berlin Olympic Games. But in 1937, construction work was paused for several months after Hitler proclaimed his plans for Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania on 30 January 1937. Part of the scheme was to remodel Berlin's entire railway system. As this included the North-South S-Bahn link, the northern end of the Anhalter S-Bahn station, already largely finished in 1936, had to be rebuilt to accommodate proposed new S-Bahn lines from G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof; as a result, the westernmost track (1) would no longer be built straight away to Potsdamer Platz station, instead it would be built later. However, war and its outcome made Hitler's plans obsolete - the S-Bahn line to G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof was never built, and the G√∂rlitzer Bahnhof was demolished to make way for the Berlin Wall. Wartime use The second stage was the southern section from Potsdamer Platz via the new underground Anhalter Bahnhof station with the Wannseebahn which opened on 9 October 1939, shortly after the start of World War II. The suburban lines to Zossen and Licherfelde- Ost via Papestra√üe and Priesterweg were connected to the tunnel on 6 November 1939, making the new North-South transversal line complete. This underground station was placed at the west side of the existing overground station. At Anhalter Bahnhof S-Bahn station a direct access route to the mainline terminus above was provided from 19 December 1940. At the S-Bahn station four platforms were provided to receive the Wannseebahn and the trains from the two suburban lines coming from Priesterweg station arriving via their separate tunnel mounds on opposite tracks of the receiving platform, and to provide the same for trains departing in the two directions. The station removed two siding tracks behind its south head. The S-Bahn North-South Link, less than six years old, became the setting for one of the most contentious episodes of the final Battle of Berlin, in late April and early May 1945. With Hitler already dead, the remaining Nazi leaders resorted to increasingly desperate measures to slow the Soviet advance, whatever the consequences for their own citizens. Fearful that the Soviets might try to storm the centre of Berlin by coming through the rail tunnels, on 2 May the Nazi leaders ordered SS troops to blow up the bulkheads where the North-South Link passed beneath the Landwehrkanal. Altogether up to of tunnels and many stations were flooded by this action, most of which had been used as public shelters and also to house military wounded in hospital trains in underground sidings. No one knows how many people were drowned as figures are so diverse and unreliable. According to Soviet propaganda up to 15,000 may have drowned, although a more conservative figure suggests 200-300.  Cold War  When the Berlin Wall was erected on 13 August 1961, it had a profound effect on rail services in and around the city, and on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn in particular. Essentially both were divided into two systems, with lines being physically severed where they crossed the border between East Berlin and West Berlin. In most cases trains on either side would simply run as far as the last stop before the border and then reverse back. The S-Bahn North-South Link saw a more bizarre - though not unique - state of affairs. This line, plus two U-Bahn lines elsewhere in the city, suffered from a quirk of geography in that they briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. This gave rise to the infamous \\"Geisterbahnh√∂fe\\" (ghost stations), those unfortunate ones on the eastern side that were sealed off from the outside world and which trains ran straight through without stopping. (One exception was the station Bahnhof Friedrichstra√üe, where passengers could change trains to the western part of the East-West-S-Bahn and one line of the U-Bahn (today U6). The S Bahn station also served as a border checkpoint for people entering East Berlin. Trains would generally slow down, however, affording passengers the strange sight of dusty, dimly lit platforms patrolled by armed guards, there to prevent any East Berliners from trying to escape to the West by train. At the points where the lines passed directly beneath the actual border, concrete \\"collars\\" were constructed within the tunnels with just the minimum clearance for trains, to prevent people clinging to the sides or roof of the coaches. Anhalter Bahnhof station itself remained open; being in West Berlin, it was the last stop for northbound trains before they entered the \\"restricted section\\", and the first stop for southbound trains after they had left the section. However, of its four platforms just two (sometimes only one) saw regular use, and the station appeared to receive only a minimum of cleaning and maintenance. Modern services After the fall of the Wall on 9 November 1989, Anhalter Bahnhof S-Bahn station and all the ghost stations underwent a major refurbishment before being re-opened on 1 March 1992. The S-Bahn station remains the only one open at the location, and still called \\"Anhalter Bahnhof\\" although it is over half a century since the great terminus aboveground closed. As for the terminus itself, today the centre portion of the fa√ßade still looks out over Askanischer Platz, having been restored several times since the demolition of the rest of the building. At the top, Ludwig Brunow's Day and Night sculptures, somewhat the worse for wear, still sat on either side of the now empty clock space until the most recent restoration of the structure in 2003-2004, but to avoid further corrosion they have now been replaced by copies (the originals can be seen in the German Museum of Technology, close by on the south bank of the Landwehr Canal). The photograph on the right shows the fa√ßade remnant in 2005. The oddly-shaped white building faintly visible in the distance on the right is the Tempodrom, a major new concert and event venue.

It was first broadcast in 2000 in Taiwan and followed by subsequent broadcasts in other Asian countries. Plot The story is set in the early Qing Dynasty. The protagonist is an uneducated street urchin called Wei Xiaobao, who was born and raised by his mother in a brothel in Yangzhou. Through a series of misadventures, Wei manages to make his way from Yangzhou to Beijing, the seat of the Qing government, where he accidentally bumbles into a fateful encounter with the young Kangxi Emperor. By hook or by crook, but also through a genuine concern and fierce loyalty towards Kangxi, Wei finds himself in the greatest of confidences and a complicated friendship with one of the most eminent monarchs in Chinese history. The plot follows Wei on a rags-to-riches journey as he becomes embroiled in political and court intrigues, helping Kangxi overcome his enemies, and accomplishing amazing achievements. Along the way, Wei meets and successfully woos seven beautiful women, climbs his way up the social ladder from brothel boy to great lord and nobleman, acquiring titles such as 'Imperial Emissary and Plenipotentiary', 'Ambassador', 'General' and 'Admiral' ‚Äî courtesy of Kangxi ‚Äî as well as finding himself in positions completely at odds with the above: 'Green Wood Lodge Master' of the Heaven and Earth Society, and 'White Dragon Marshal' of the Mystic Dragon Cult. In the end, however, Wei cannot reconcile his two separate lives ‚Äî as an anti-Qing rebel and Kangxi's devoted courtier. He chose to offer up his own life ‚Äî in return for Kangxi's munificence towards him and also as an honourable way out of the Heaven and Earth Society. Pained and aggrieved beyond words, Kangxi orders the execution of his one and only true friend. Afterwards, plagued by loss and guilt, Kangxi took a long walk along the Great Wall, asking Heaven for guidance ‚Äî only to be happily surprised by the appearance of Wei, who did not die. After saving his mate's life once again, Wei bids Kangxi farewell, reaffirming their friendship which will, from that point onwards, remain only in their minds and memories.

The story is loosely based on the 16th century novel Journey to the West. Synopsis It is a twisted story about the monk Tripitaka and his three disciples who are journeying west to acquire Buddhist scriptures. While stopping in Shache City (present day Yarkand), they come under attack by minions of the evil Tree Demon. The demons capture his three disciples. Tripitaka is then captured by the king of reptiles and placed under the care of the ugly and shunned Meiyan, who falls in love with the monk. Luckily for Tripitaka, an alien princess rescues him, and Meiyan decides to team up with the princess in order to rescue the disciples. Plot Tang monk Tripitaka (Nicholas Tse) and his three disciples Monkey King Sun WuKong (Bolin Chen), Pig Monk Zhu WuNeng (Kenny Kwan), and Sand Monk Sha WuJing (Steven Cheung) arrive triumphantly to a hero's welcome in Shache city. Tripitaka's most arduous challenge to achieve deification is to come, only he can perform. During their stay in the city, the three disciples are captured by evil Tree Spirits. Tripitaka borrows the Golden Pole and tries to find a way to save them. He meets a young lizard imp Meiyan (Charlene Choi) who is more than a visual match for Quasimodo: matted bushy hair, and teeth of any dentist's nightmare. Meiyan falls in love with Tripitaka at first sight and devotes herself to trailing him. She even sets a love trap to ensnare him. Tripitaka unwittingly falls into the trap and in the process breaks the Heavenly Code. The region is one full of monsters, strange beings and creatures of unknown origins and among them are the beautiful Princess XiaoShan (Fan Bing-bing) and her army. On a passing journey to Earth her path crosses Tripitaka's and she vows her aid. Tripitaka decides to leave with the Princess. Meiyan is heartbroken. She picks a fight with Princess XiaoShan and, although she loses, she finally discovers her own identity as a galactic warrior. She eventually helps the princess in defeating the enemy and rescues Tripitaka and his disciples. After the battle, Meiyan surrenders to the Temple of Heaven for judgment.

Pupils who attend are between the ages of 11 to 18. The school welcomes all students. Overview Denbigh High School is situated on Ruthin Road, Denbigh and had 542 pupils on roll in 2017. About 6% of the learners speak Welsh as a first language or to an equivalent standard. The school serves Denbigh, St Asaph and surrounding rural areas, including Trefnant, Henllan and Tremeirchion. The motto of this school is 'Believe Exceed'. This motto was created by the school council and centres around the concept that the school should be a place where students can just \\"BE\\" - themselves, successful, creative, happy. The school has also updated the uniform to reflect its new ethos, with compulsory introduction into Years 7, 10 and 12 and optional uptake for Year 8, 9, 11 and 13. The school was originally situated on two separate sites with the first 3 years on the existing site and the older years at an older building on Middle Lane, which is situated half a mile away. This Middle Lane site was built in 1903 as The County School and Denbigh High ceased using it in 1983. The site then became a Youth Club and is used for Teacher Training and Education Administration. The school is in conjunction with the secondary department of the autistic school Ysgol Plas Brondyffryn, which was built next door in 2003. In August 2017, the school achieved its best set of A Level results in its history, with 77% of students achieving the top grades of A*-C. In 2019, A-Level students achieved the highest percentage of A*-A results in Denbighshire. Denbigh High School forms part of the Dyffryn Clwyd Consortium at A level. This was a partnership agreement with neighbouring schools, St Brigid's School (in Denbigh), Ysgol Brynhyfryd (in Ruthin), Ysgol Glan Clwyd (in St Asaph), and Denbigh College, to provide transport for students who wish to study subjects from different schools. However, in 2018 Ysgol Brynhyfryd and Ysgol Glan Clwyd withdrew from the agreement. The Consortium now consists of Denbigh High School, St Brigid's School, Denbigh College and Llysfasi College. The school has a strong tradition of representing Wales at the F1 in Schools Championship. Team Tachyon competed in Texas and Singapore and, this year, Team Quantum are travelling to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Finals. Headteachers As of March 2018, the Headteacher is Dr R P Evans, who was Acting Headteacher since November 2017 following the resignation of former Headteacher Mr Simeon Molloy. Previous Headteachers include: Ms Alison Duncan, Mr Bill Bailey, Mr G D Dodd and Mr Maurice Bitcon. The Deputy Headteacher is Mr D Wilde, appointed in January 2019. Assistant Headteachers are Mr A Skeoch, Mrs R Williams and Mrs D Howlett. Special education partnership The school has a longstanding partnership with Ysgol Plas Brondyffryn, a special needs school catering mainly to pupils with autism spectrum disorders, as well as a smaller number of students diagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, cerebral palsy and developmental co-ordination disorder. In 2003 a new Secondary Dept. of Brondyffryn was built behind Denbigh High, and caters for 56 youngsters from throughout North and Mid Wales along with parts of Cheshire and Liverpool. This unit has its own, self-contained science laboratory, design-technology workshop, ICT department and Life Learning (cookery) kitchen. The building is roughly shaped like a capital letter G, and is divided into five corridors. This building forms the senior department of Brondyffryn; the junior department is located near Ysgol Frongoch, and was reconstructed shortly following the senior department. The project increases integration between some autistic teenagers and youngsters from the local comprehensive. In 2004, the first full-time transfer from Brondyffryn to Denbigh High took place, and since then there have been several more transitions to full-time mainstream education. However, owing to a past lack of control over the more aggressive pupils, those left permanently scarred suffer an astonishingly high rate of addiction and Borderline Personality Disorder.BBC News  WALES  Special school given the green light Controversy In September 2009, Maths teacher at the school, Ian Gee, was suspended and later fired from the school when images of child pornography were found on a computer at his home. Investigators found no evidence to suggest criminal activity had taken place on school premises or during school hours. He was banned from working with children for five years. In December 2011 Paul Evans who was a teacher at the school but also the chief examiner for the WJEC history qualification at the time, was subject to a \\"sting\\" operation by the daily Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/8940799/Exam-boards- Were-cheating-were-telling-you-the-question-cycle.html https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8958051/Suspended- examiner-Paul-Evans-League-tables-put-too-much-pressure-on- schools.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/dec/15/examiner- regrets-telling-teachers-cheating https://www.channel4.com/news/inquiry- launched-into-examiners-tipping-off-teachers https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/examiners-say- sorry-over-tip-offs-6277427.html which triggered an investigation into all examination boards, by the then education secretary Michael Gove. The sting sought to prove allegations that examiners were providing attending teachers with information which they could use to improve students results unfairly. The sting pointed specifically to informing attendees that the questions written by the examiners were subject to a cycle. Assistant Headteacher and Performing Arts teacher Gwawr Ceiriog was fired by the school in 2014 for failing to hand over charity raised money for BBC Children in Need, and for pocketing student payments for hoodies. In November 2013, she was ordered to pay ¬£1,400 in compensation. In September 2016, Denbigh High School placed 72 pupils; mainly girls, in exclusion and isolation on the first day of school, for wearing 'inappropriate' uniform. The case saw coverage from many major news companies and received outcry from parents, many claiming that the uniform is adequate and claiming they could not afford to purchase new uniform.

He was one of the most internationally critically acclaimed Romani singer-songwriters. Due to his eminent impact on music in Eastern Europe, he was dubbed the \\"King of Romani music\\". During his career, which spanned over four decades, he recorded 50 singles and 20 albums, and he is believed to have written 700 songs.  Biography = Origin and early life  Bajramoviƒá was born in Ni≈° into a Romani family, in the Gypsy quarters (Ciganska mahala).\\"Doznajemo\\". Doznajemo. He spoke of himself \\"I am not Romani, I am a Serb, a Serbian Gypsy\\".–Ç–æ—Ä—í–µ–≤–∏—õ 2011, p. 121 He attended primary school in Ni≈° for only the first four years. On quitting school, he picked up his musical education on the street. He was nicknamed ≈†abi (–®–∞–±–∏).–Ç–æ—Ä—í–µ–≤–∏—õ 2011, p. 117 His childhood was noted by extreme poverty, thus he worked as a busker to provide an income for his very bare family. In his free time, he enjoyed playing football, but was diagnosed with poliomyelitis as a child, which lead to a decadence in his amateur football career.  Imprisonment  At 19 years he ran away from the army, out of love. As a deserter, he was sentenced to three years prison on the island Goli Otok. He spent his time as a good goalkeeper in the prison football team. Because of his nimbleness and speed, they called him \\"Black Panther\\". Soon he forced his way into the prison orchestra that played, among other things, jazz (mostly Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and sometimes John Coltrane) with Spanish and Mexican pieces.  Music career  After Goli Otok, his intensive music career began. He made his first record in 1964, with the recording act Crna mamba (Black Mamba). He continued to produce music with Crna mamba for 20 years. The highlight of their career was their performance for Indira Gandhi in India, where he gained the title King of Romani music. He also performed to Yugoslav politician Josip Broz Tito. In the early nineties, he recorded \\"ƒêelem, ƒêelem\\", which is considered the Romani people's ethnic anthem. At the time, he decided to change his stage presence, starting to wear sunglasses while performing. Since 2000, he started collaborating with Bosnian-based Sevdah act Mostar Sevdah Reunion, which rose him to prominence yet again. In 2001, he recorded the album A Gipsy Legend with the group, released on behalf of World Connection, which gained international attention. In 2002, he worked with Croatian band Cubismo. Their partnership resulted in the appearance of \\"Geljan dade\\", one of Bajramoviƒá's best known songs. Published on the album Romano raj, the song was noted for its complex structure and lyrical content. The abstract motif of the song presents suffering people of Romani descent whose fathers went the United States to provide income for their children, ultimately leading to more problems due to their absence. Geljan dade was covered by a wide range of musicians from varying genres, including Gru, Muharem Serbezovski and Boban Zdravkoviƒá. Zdravkoviƒá performed the first known version of the song in Serbian, titled \\"Prokleta je Amerika\\". In 2005, Milo≈° Stojanoviƒá and Dragi ≈†estiƒá directed his biopic film, titled ≈†aban, which gained notoriety in Eastern Europe. For the purposes of that documentary Dragi ≈†estiƒá produced the album for Snail Records with the title \\"Saban\\", which won a World Music Award. In 2008, he produced Lova with Serbian hip-hop artist Sky Wikluh for the Serbian TV series Vratice se rode.

Archived 2009-10-24. Description Acer japonicum is a small deciduous tree growing to 5‚Äì10 m (rarely 15 m) tall, with a trunk up to 40 cm in diameter. The bark is smooth on young trees, becoming rough and scaly on old trees. The shoots are slender, and thinly downy with whitish hairs.

In autumn, the leaves turn bright orange to dark red. The flowers are 1 cm in diameter, dark purplish-red with five sepals and petals; they are produced 10‚Äì15 together in drooping corymbs in early spring as the leaves start to open. The fruit is a paired samara with the nutlets 7 mm in diameter with a 20‚Äì25 mm wing, hanging under the leaves.van Gelderen, C. J. & van Gelderen, D. M. (1999). Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . Cultivation Acer japonicum is frequently cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions of Europe, North America, and elsewhere, though much less commonly than A. palmatum. In cultivation, it is often only a shrubby tree with multiple trunks joining at ground-level. Its preferred growing conditions are similar to those of A. palmatum, but it is sometimes considered more tolerant of cold, especially compared to the more delicate cultivars of the latter. Numerous cultivars have been selected, some of which have their own common names (e.g. \\"grape-leaf maple\\" for A. japonicum 'Vitifolium'). Other popular cultivars are 'Aconitifolium' (\\"downy Japanese maple\\") which has deeply incised leaves; and 'Green Cascade', with drooping to pendulous branches. All three cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Because of their variation from the wild species, some cultivars are difficult to assign to species, and they have often been mis-labeled as cultivars of the other related species; notably 'Aureum' has commonly been cited as a cultivar of A. japonicum, but is actually derived from A. shirasawanum.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . Cultivars of this maple are found in almost every maple collection including Esveld Aceretum (Boskoop, Netherlands) and the large Acer section of Arnold Arboretum (Boston, Massachusetts, USA). They are also common in more general collections of horticulture, such as Valley Gardens (Surrey, England). Similar species The closely related species Acer shirasawanum (Japanese, „Ç™„Ç™„Ç§„Çø„É§„É°„Ç§„Ç≤„ÉÑ ooitayameigetsu) from southern Japan is sometimes included as a subspecies of A. japonicum. It is distinct in its hairless shoots, and usually smaller leaves. Another related species, Acer sieboldianum (Japanese: „Ç≥„Éè„Ç¶„ÉÅ„ÉØ„Ç´„Ç®„Éá kohauchiwakaede), is best distinguished by its yellow (not red) flowers, and smooth bark even on old trees. It is more easily distinguished from Acer palmatum, as that species rarely has leaves with more than seven lobes.

Originally raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force for service during World War I, the battalion formed part of the 1st Brigade, attached to the 1st Division. It was formed shortly after the war broke out and was among the first Australian units to be sent overseas, arriving in Egypt in December 1914. In April 1915 the battalion participated in the Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore in the second and third waves. In December 1915 the 3rd Battalion was evacuated from the Gallipoli peninsula and withdrawn to Egypt again, where it took part in the defence of the Suez Canal before being sent to France to fight on the Western Front in March 1916. For the next two and a half years the unit would serve in the trenches in France and Belgium and would take part in many of the major battles fought during that time. In May 1919, following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded and its personnel repatriated back to Australia. In 1921, the AIF was officially disbanded and the previously-existing militia units of the Australian Military Forces were reorganised in order to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of their associated AIF units. As a result, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment), was raised around the area to the west of Sydney. Between 1921 and 1939 the battalion underwent a number of reorganisations and merges due to the economic pressures brought about by the Great Depression and subsequently in 1930 the battalion was merged with the 4th Battalion (Australian Rifles), before being delinked in 1937, when it was amalgamated with the 53rd Battalion (West Sydney Regiment). Following the outbreak of World War II, many members of the battalion volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and were allocated to the 2/3rd Battalion, with whom they served in North Africa, Syria, Greece, Crete and then later in New Guinea. In 1942, following the entry of Japan into the war, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment) was mobilised and brought up to its full wartime establishment with national servicemen. In May 1942 the battalion was sent to Port Moresby, where it joined the rest of the 30th Brigade, to undertake garrison duties. In July the Japanese landed around Gona and as reinforcements were brought up from Australia, elements of the 30th Brigade began a number of delaying actions around Kokoda. In September 1942, the 3rd Battalion was sent up the Kokoda Trail, where it had the distinction of being one of only two militia units to fight alongside its associated AIF unit. Over the next couple of months it assisted in the recapturing of Kokoda, before participating in the fighting around Buna and Gona. In 1943, the battalion was withdrawn to Australia along with the rest of the 30th Brigade, where it was subsequently disbanded in July and its personnel absorbed into its associated AIF unit, the 2/3rd Battalion. In 1948, the battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force, based around Canberra. In 1960, when the Australian Army was reorganised along Pentropic lines, the battalion was reduced to a company-sized unit and formed 'C' Company, 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (3 RNSWR). In 1965, this company was expanded to become a full battalion again when the Pentropic divisional structure was abandoned; however, in 1987, 3 RNSWR was amalgamated with 4 RNSWR to form the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. History=World War I Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, following the outbreak of World War I it was decided to raise an all volunteer force, outside of the already existing militia organisation, known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).Grey 2008, p. 85. Many members of the militia joined up and to a large extent, where possible, the AIF battalions were formed on a territorial basis, which meant that many of the AIF units were able to maintain the identity of their associated militia units. The 3rd Battalion, AIF, was raised soon after the declaration of war, and began concentrating at Randwick, drawing its recruits from the Werriwa area of New South Wales. The militia unit that was operating in the area at that time was the 43rd (Werriwa) Infantry Regiment, a regiment that could trace its lineage back to 1869.Grey 2001, p. 172. After two months, during which time the battalion undertook a period of basic training, the 3rd Battalion departed Australia, proceeding to Egypt, where they arrived on 2 December 1914. After undertaking another period of training in Egypt, the battalion was employed in the defence of the Suez Canal, before being committed to the Gallipoli Campaign. On 25 April 1915, the 3rd Battalion took part in the landing at Anzac Cove, going ashore with the second and third waves. As a stalemate settled over the peninsula the battalion was involved in the defence of the beachhead, before taking part in the Battle of Lone Pine in August. It was during this battle, at Sasse's Sap, that Private John Hamilton, performed the deeds that led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. For the next four months the battalion remained at Gallipoli, before being evacuated along with the rest of the allied forces, in December 1915. John Hamilton, the 3rd Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient from World War I. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where they were once again used in the defence of the Suez Canal against the Turks and the AIF undertook a period of reorganisation and expansion. In March 1916, the 3rd Battalion embarked for France, where for the next two and a half years it would serve in the trenches along the Western Front. Following a period of acclimatisation where the battalion undertook duties in a quiet sector of the line, in July 1916 the battalion took part in its first major action in Europe, during the Battle of Pozi√®res. Later they took part in the fighting around Ypres in Belgium, before returning to the Somme to man the line during the winter. Throughout 1917, they were involved in operations against the Hindenburg Line, spending a majority of the year in the line near Ypres. In 1918, the battalion was used to help stop the German spring offensive in March and April, before taking part in the final Allied offensive launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918, which ultimately brought an end to the war. As a part of this offensive, the 3rd Battalion continued operations until late September 1918, when they were withdrawn for rest and reorganisation. They were out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 and following that the slow process of demobilisation and repatriation of men began. By May 1919, the majority of the battalion's personnel had been returned to Australia for discharge and the battalion was disbanded. During the course of its involvement in the war, the 3rd Battalion suffered 3,598 casualties, of which 1,312 were killed in action. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, three Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, four Distinguished Service Orders, 28 Military Crosses, 34 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 92 Military Medals with three Bars, eight Meritorious Service Medals, 74 Mentions in Despatches.The unit also received six foreign awards, although the AWM source does not clarify what these awards were. Inter war years During the war, while the units of the AIF had been overseas fighting in Europe and the Middle East, the militia units had remained in Australia on home service, providing security at ports, defence installations and other facilities of importance to the war effort.Scott 1941, p. 196. However, due to the large numbers of militiamen that volunteered for service with the AIF many of these units were greatly depleted and it was not until after the war, in 1919, that the compulsory training scheme began again. In 1921 the AIF was officially disbanded and the following month it was decided to reorganise the militia units and to redesignate them in order to perpetuate the identity of the AIF units that had fought in the war.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result of this decision, and due to the links that the 3rd Battalion, AIF, had with the 43rd (Werriwa) Infantry Regiment, this unit was reformed and designated as the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment) and inherited that unit's battle honours. In 1929, the compulsory training scheme was suspended following the election of the Scullin Labor government.Grey 2008, p. 138. This, coupled with the economic hardships of the Great Depression and the general apathy towards defence matters in this time, meant that the unit's numbers fell rapidly and so, in 1930, the battalion was amalgamated with the 4th Battalion (Australian Rifles). These two units would remain linked until 1937, when they were delinked and the 3rd Battalion amalgamated with the 53rd Battalion (West Sydney Regiment), to form the 3rd/53rd Battalion (Werriwa and West Sydney Regiment). This did not last for very long, though, and shortly after the two units were delinked and the 3rd Battalion was assigned to the 14th Brigade, based around Goulburn with the 55th Battalion (New South Wales Rifle Regiment). World War II When World War II began it was again decided to form an all volunteer force for overseas service.Grey 2008, pp. 145‚Äì146. Once again this force, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force, was raised outside of the already existing military forces of the militia and the government sought largely to prevent wholesale enlistment by members of the militia in the AIF as it was felt that there was a need to build up Australia's home defences due to the possibility of war with the Japanese. Nevertheless, large numbers of militiamen volunteered for service in the AIF. Once again there was an attempt to preserve the territorial identity of the militia units and as a result, many men from the 3rd Battalion (Werriwa Regiment) were allocated to the 2/3rd Battalion, which was raised at Ingleburn in October 1939. This unit would later go on to participate in the fighting in North Africa, Greece, Crete, Syria and then later in New Guinea. Meanwhile, in January 1940, the compulsory training scheme which had been suspended since 1929 was reintroduced and units of the militia were progressively called up for periods of full-time training in order to boost their readiness.Grey 2008, p. 146. In January 1942, following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and the British in Malaya, the situation in the Pacific worsened and many Australians began to worry about invasion. As a result of this many of the militia units were mobilised in this time and a number of them were sent to New Guinea to carry out defensive duties.The provisions of the Defence Act 1903 precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, but as New Guinea was an Australian territory in 1942, it was technically not considered to be overseas within the definition of the Act. In 1943, the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 was introduced to expand the area in which militia units could be employed. The 3rd Battalion was one of these and upon mobilisation it was brought up to its wartime establishment with a number of drafts of national servicemen recruited from regional New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

Cameron, commanding officer, delivering orders for a patrol around Menari, September 1942 The battalion began training in earnest near Maitland, New South Wales, before being sent along with the rest of the 14th Brigade to the coast to undertake defensive duties near Newcastle. In May they were relieved from these duties and returned to camp near Maitland, before going on leave prior to deployment overseas. By the end of the month the 3rd Battalion had arrived in Port Moresby where they began garrison duties as part of the 14th Brigade and alongside the 30th Brigade, which consisted of the 39th and 49th Battalions. In July the New Guinea campaign began when the Japanese landed troops near Buna and began to move inland. In an effort to delay their advance in time for reinforcements to arrive from Australia, elements of 39th Battalion began a series of delaying actions around Kokoda, while the 3rd Battalion remained in Port Moresby to defend the seaport. In early September, as reinforcements began to arrive, the battalion moved up the Kokoda Trail to Ioribaiwa, where they began patrolling operations under the command of the 21st Brigade in order to defend the village against advancing Japanese elements. Alongside the 2/6th Independent Company and the 2/14th and 2/16th Battalions, the 3rd Battalion helped hold the village for four days before falling back to Imita Ridge on 17 September. Soon after the Japanese, having reached the limit of their supply lines, began to withdraw and the 3rd Battalion subsequently participated in the advance back up the Kokoda Trail, carrying out patrolling operations as they re-occupied numerous villages that had been lost earlier in the campaign. Late in October, after the Second Battle of Eora Creek ‚Äì Templeton's Crossing, the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a brief period of rest at Myola, before assuming defensive responsibilities for Kokoda village on 3 November 1942. The battalion joined the Australian pursuit towards the Kumusi, taking part in the fighting around Oivi‚ÄìGorari before taking part in the fighting around Buna and Gona later in the month. Around this time, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 7th Machine Gun Battalion.Morgan 2019, p. 7. In early 1943, the battalion was brought back to Australia for reorganisation. Based on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, the battalion was brought back up to establishment and the 30th Brigade was transferred to the 6th Division, with a view to participating in further operations in New Guinea. However, in July it was decided to disband the brigade, to provide reinforcements for the rest of the 6th Division.Dexter 1961, p. 17. As a result of this, the battalion's personnel were reallocated according to their categories of service, with the national servicemen being absorbed into the 36th Battalion, while those that had volunteered for overseas service joined the survivors of the 2/22nd Battalion to form the 3rd/22nd Battalion. This was only short-lived, though, for later this unit was absorbed by the 2/3rd Battalion. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, two Military Crosses and five Military Medals. Post World War II In 1948, the 3rd Battalion (Werriwa Regiment) was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was the forerunner to the Australian Army Reserve that currently exists. This time the battalion was based around Canberra, with depots around regional New South Wales. As had been the case following World War I, it was decided that the units of the CMF would become the custodians of the battle honours earned by the AIF during World War II, and thus the battle honours of the 2/3rd Battalion were passed to the Werriwa Regiment. Between 1951 and 1960 a national service scheme operated and the battalion's numbers remained reasonably steady, however, in 1960 the scheme was suspended once more and the Australian Army was reorganised with the introduction of the Pentropic divisional structure.Grey 2008, p. 228. As a result of this the CMF was greatly reduced and fourteen infantry battalions were disbanded altogether, while many others were amalgamated into the battalions of the six State-based regiments. As a result of this, the 3rd Battalion was reduced to a company-sized element of the 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming 'C' Company.Festberg 1972, p. 60. In 1965, the Australian Army abandoned the Pentropic divisional structure and in an attempt to restore some of the regional ties of the State-based regiments, a number of the regional companies of the State-based regiments were split and used to form new battalions with their traditional numerical designations. As a result, 'C' Company, 3 RNSWR was used to re-raise the 3rd Battalion in its own right. This unit would remain in existence until 1987, when further reforms to the Army Reserve led to a reduction in the number of infantry units across Australia and 3 RNSWR was amalgamated with 4 RNSWR to form the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment.Shaw 2010, pp. 11-12.

In 1938 the new church had been built, the old rotunda was preserved and the murals were restored between 1967 and 1970.

It is narrated by Grubbs Grady, the narrator of Lord Loss and Slawter. The plot is part of a two-part story, which continues in book six. Though the previous four books have not been in chronological order, this book is the furthest book into the future. It mainly deals with whether or not Grubbs Grady will be struck with lycanthropy and how he will deal with it. This book has been nominated for several prizes. The title was originally announced at the Edinburgh Book Festival. In 2007, Blood Beast was nominated for the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award in the UK, but lost to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling. Plot summary Blood Beast takes place about a year after the events recounted in Slawter. Grubbs Grady is back in Carcery Vale. His life seems to have settled down at last. He's getting on well with Dervish. Grubbs has been struggling to contain the magical talent he discovered in the town of Slawter. He doesn't want to become a Disciple and he hopes his abilities will fade if he hides them long enough. His magician's prowess is growing all the time. He is having dreadful nightmares and suspects he might be turning into a werewolf.Blood Beast - plot outline Things come to a head when Grubbs and his friends, Loch and Bill-E decide to go on a treasure hunt. While exploring a tunnel that leads to a cave, Grubbs hears a scream behind him and turns to find Loch's lifeless body on the floor, blood seeping from his head. Bill-E leaves to get help, and Grubbs attempts unsuccessfully to resuscitate Loch, whose heart has stopped. Dervish returns with Bill-E and they dispose of Loch's body in a nearby quarry. Dervish explains that the cave is a potential doorway for demons to enter the human world and it is his responsibility to safeguard it. Grubbs returns to school, and meets with the new psychologist, Juni Swan, whom he had previously met in Slawter. Juni also has a gift for magic. She becomes romantically involved with Dervish who teaches her more spells. For several nights around the time of the full moon, Grubbs has a difficult time and is in extreme pain. Juni suggests that they should meet at the cave. Grubbs runs to the cave, where he turns into a werewolf. When he returns to a human state, he finds that he has killed Bill-E's grandparents and legal guardians. Not wanting to kill again, he and Juni decide to run away. They board a plane and Grubbs falls asleep. When he awakes, the cockpit opens and demons appear on the plane, and then begin attacking the passengers. Is Juni a friend or foe?

It is specially selected so that it presents the range of weather phenomena for the location in question, while still giving annual averages that are consistent with the long-term averages for the location in question. TMY data is frequently used in building simulation, in order to assess the expected heating and cooling costs for the design of the building. It is also used by designers of solar energy systems including solar domestic hot water systems and large-scale solar thermal power plants. Since they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.

This is the first time this has happened with any of the Darren Shan books, possibly initiated by the recent popularity increase in the author's works. It is published in the United Kingdom and the United States. Plot Picking up where Blood Beast left off, Grubbs is on a plane in a dire situation face-to- face with Lord Loss and Juni Swan who has just been revealed to be one of his higher ranked familiars. Just when it seems like Grubbs will be killed, Beranabus (the homeless man from the previous book that had been following him around Carcery Vale, and a powerful magician who the Disciples follow) appears, the two jump from the plane, and fly to his cave. Once there, Beranabus and Kernel take Grubbs with them to fight a demon in one of the Demonata worlds. Grubbs chickens out and is stuck in Beranabus' home for seven weeks. Once Beranabus and Kernel return from demon hunting, they all discover that the tunnel that Bec had sealed 1600 years ago has been opened, and hell has been brought to Earth. Enlisting the help of the Disciples, Grubbs, Kernel, and Beranabus set out to reseal the tunnel and remove the Demonata from Earth at the same time. After arriving at the tunnel, Kernel gets his eyes gouged out by Spine (one of Lord Loss's familiars) and Grubbs sees all his friends' and Dervish's heads carried by demons (Not Bill-E's). The spirit of Bec appears again and tells Beranabus that sealing the tunnel will not remove the demons like it did last time. In the chaos, the Kah-Gash (the weapon powerful enough to destroy universes) awakes in Grubbs, Kernel and Bec and turn back time to a point just before the tunnel was opened, providing Grubbs, Kernel, and Beranabus a way to prevent mankind's extinction. During the cave battle between Beranabus' group and Lord Loss', it is revealed that Bill-E must be killed to prevent the opening of the tunnel, since he unwittingly sacrificed Loch to open the tunnel. Because Dervish is unable to kill his nephew, Grubbs is forced to painlessly kill Bill-E. This seals the tunnel, and also forces the retreat of a shadowy creature unlike any demon Grubbs has seen before. Bec, her essence trapped within Grubbs, fills Bill-E's body and mutates it to resemble hers. It is revealed that Bec's spirit has been trapped inside the cave for the past 1600 years, believed by Beranabus to be because she is part of the Kah-Gash, along with Grubbs and Kernel. Now knowing what is at stake, Grubbs leaves Dervish in the care of Bec and joins Beranabus and Kernel on their never ending quest to prevent more tunnels from opening and to learn more about the creature known as the Shadow.

It is 60 km northeast of Bratislava and 25 km northwest of Trnava. The village is made of two parts, Smolenice and Smolenick√° Nov√° Ves (formerly Ne≈°tich). History The location of Smolenice at the edge of the basin of Trnava, easy access, and fertility facilitated settlement of the land in the Paleolithic era. There are only occasional archeological discoveries from this time, however, with more coming from the Neolithic era. The most significant period was the transition between the Bronze and Iron Ages, when the Celts around the 6th century BC had an oppidum above the village. There was a settlement on the same place during the Great Moravia period. From the 10th century it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The village was first mentioned in 1256 under name villa Solmus, though the settlement started to grow in the late Middle Ages. In the 14th century, the gothic Smolenice Castle was built above the village, as a part of a chain of fortifications protecting the passes through the Little Carpathians. The castle was royally owned at first, but it changed hands for several centuries until, in disrepair, in 1777 the P√°lffys assumed ownership of it. On 28 May, 1704 the battle of Smolenice between the Kurucs and Austrian Imperial army took place. During the Napoleonic Wars, it burned down, and only the outer fortifications remained. In the 20th century, reconstruction of the Smolenice castle ruins began, and was finished in 1953, reconstructed as a ch√¢teau. From 1880 to 1883, Count Jozef P√°lffy built a wood processing plant near the nearby village of Majd√°n. This was replaced in 1968 with the a paint factory Chemolak. On 6 August 2016 Cologne artist Gunter Demnig erected five Stolpersteine for Friedrich Beinhacker and four members of the Sidon family, all murdered by the Nazi regime.

She won five times at The English Schools Championships over this distance. Sarah also runs 60m hurdles indoors. It was however during her time at the University of Bath and Loughborough University, where she gained a duel degree in Geography and Sport & Leisure Management, that she developed into a world-class athlete. At Bath she was coached by Colin Jackson's former coach Malcolm Arnold. She is currently coached by the well known Graham Knight and also occasionally trains at Leamington Athletics Club. She works part-time at a local golf course when not training or competing and lives in Lillington. Sara currently runs for the Sale Harriers athletics club. She was ranked 4th in the UK for 2006 and 23rd best ever in the 100m hurdles. For the 2005/2006 indoor season she was ranked 3rd in the UK in 60m hurdles, and on 27 January 2007 she became one of the British Top 10 fastest women over that distance ever.

Life He was the son of Sir William le Scrope, who was bailiff to the earl of Richmond in Richmondshire. Geoffrey's older brother Henry was also a lawyer, and served as Chief Justice twice, 1317‚Äì23 and 1329‚Äì30. His mother was Constance, daughter and heiress of Thomas, son of Gillo de Newsham, variously described as of Newsham-on-Tees and of Newsham-on-Tyne. Geoffrey Scrope certainly had an estate at Whalton, near Morpeth, a few miles south-east of which there is a Newsham, but it is not upon the Tyne. Like his brother, Scrope adopted the profession of the law, and by 1316 he was king's serjeant. He is also called 'valettus regis.' He was summoned to councils and parliaments, and occasionally sat on judicial commissions. In the baronial conflicts of the reign of Edward II he was a loyal adherent of the crown. He was involved in the proceedings both against Thomas of Lancaster and Andrew Harclay. He was knighted in 1323, and became Chief Justice for the first time on 21 March 1324. He managed, however, to survive politically the overthrow both of Edward II in 1326 and of Roger Mortimer in 1330. After retiring as a justice, he campaigned with Edward III in Flanders, and distinguished himself as a soldier. He was also one of the instigators behind the king's actions against Archbishop Stratford in 1340. The small estate he held as early as 1312 in Coverdale, south of Wensleydale, he augmented before 1318, by the acquisition of the manor of Clifton on Ure at the entrance of the latter dale, where he obtained a license to build a castle in that year. Early in the next reign he purchased the neighbouring manor of Masham from the representatives of its old lords, the Wautons, who held it from the Mowbrays by the service of an annual barbed arrow. Eltham Mandeville and other Vesci lands in Kent had passed into his hands by 1318. One of Edward II's last acts was to invest him with the great castle and honour of Skipton in Craven forfeited by Roger, lord Clifford. So closely was he identified with the court party that Mortimer was alleged to have projected the same fate for him as for the Despensers. But though Edward's deposition was followed by Scrope's removal from office, he received a pardon in February 1328, and was reinstated as chief justice. He was a soldier and diplomatist as well as a lawyer, and his services in the former capacities were in such request that his place had frequently to be supplied by substitutes, one of whom was his brother Henry, and for a time (1334‚Äì7) he seems to have exchanged his post for the (nominal) second justiceship of the common pleas. Again chief justice in 1338, he finally resigned the office before October in that year on the outbreak of the French war. In the tournaments of the previous reign, at one of which he was knighted, Scrope had not disgraced the azure bend or of his family, which he bore with a silver label for difference, and in the first months of Edward III's rule he was with the army which nearly joined battle with the Scots at Stanhope Park in Weardale. But it was in diplomatic business that Edward III found Scrope most useful. He took him to France in 1329. In 1331 and 1333, he was entrusted with important foreign missions. He had only just been designated (1334) one of the deputies to keep a watch over John Baliol when he was sent on an embassy to Brittany and France. In 1335 and again in 1337, Scottish affairs engaged his attention. Just before crossing to Flanders in 1338 Edward III sent Scrope with the Earl of Northampton to his ally the emperor, and later in the year he was employed in the negotiations opened at the eleventh hour with Philip VI. He had at least six knights in his train, and took the field in the campaign which ended bloodlessly at Buironfosse (1339). Galfrid le Baker (p. 65) relates the well-known anecdote of Scrope's punishing Cardinal Bernard de Montfavence's boasts of the inviolability of France by taking him up a high tower and showing him her frontiers all in flames. He now appears with the formal title of king's secretary, and spent the winter of 1339‚Äì40 in negotiating a marriage between the heir of Flanders and Edward's daughter Isabella. Returning to England with the King in February, he was granted two hundred marks a year to support his new dignity of banneret. Going back to Flanders in June, he took part in the siege of Tournay, and about Christmas died at Ghent. His body was carried to Coverham Abbey, to which he had given the church of Sadberge. Jervaulx and other monasteries had also experienced his liberality. Besides his Yorkshire and Northumberland estates, he left manors in five other counties. Scrope was the more distinguished of the two notable brothers whose unusual fortune it was to found two great baronial families within the limits of a single Yorkshire dale. Family Geoffrey and his wife Ivette (de Ros) had five sons. Their eldest son, Henry (whose daughter Joan married Henry Fitzhugh), became the first Baron Scrope of Masham. Scrope married Ivetta, in all probability daughter of Sir William de Roos of Ingmanthorpe, near Wetherby. A second marriage with Lora, daughter of Gerard de Furnival of Hertfordshire and Yorkshire, and widow of Sir John Ufflete or Usflete, has been inferred from a gift of her son, Gerard Ufflete, to Scrope and his mother jointly in 1331; but Ivetta is named as Scrope's wife in 1332. By the latter he had five sons and three daughters. The sons were: *Henry, first baron Scrope of Masham; *Thomas, who predeceased his father; *William (1325?‚Äì1367), who fought at the Battle of Cr√©cy, Poitiers, and Najara, and died in Spain; *Stephen, who was at the Battle of Cr√©cy and the siege of Berwick (1356); *Geoffrey (died 1383), LL.B. (probably of Oxford), prebendary of Lincoln, London, and York. The daughters were Beatrice and Constance, who married respectively Sir Andrew and Sir Geoffrey Luttrell of Lincolnshire; and Ivetta, the wife of John de Hothom.

In 2000, ST Engineering acquired the Chartered Industries of Singapore (CIS) through ST Automotive, a subsidiary of ST Engineering, and the new company was named ST Kinetics. Given the initial charter of CIS to support the local defence requirements, the main defence customer of ST Kinetics remains as the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Besides manufacturing small arms and munitions, some of STELS' key military products include the SAR 21 assault rifle, the Bionix AFV, the Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier and the Terrex APC. These weapons and ammunition are often made to U.S. or NATO specifications for export. The company holds a number of subsidiaries overseas, mainly in the U.S., Canada, China and India. Recent acquisitions between 2004 and 2009 have seen new construction equipment, specialised bodies and trailers for urban services being brought into ST Kinetics' stable of products, which was previously dominated by military weapons and platforms. Together with the other ST Engineering companies, STELS is part of the Singapore Defence Ecosystem of users, developers and producers in support of the Third Generation SAF. History=1967‚Äì1986: Rapid growth and expansion CIS was originally incorporated on 27 January 1967, when it started out by producing ordnance for the SAF. CIS' first product was the 5.56√ó45mm NATO round; other CIS products include the license-built Colt M16S1 (equivalent to the M16A1), and locally designed weapons such as the Ultimax 100 SAW, the SAR-80 and the SR-88 assault rifles. Several other companies were formed under CIS over the span of the next 2 decades, with the expansion of the defence business, such as Unicorn International (UI) in 1971, Ordnance & Development Engineering (ODE) in 1973, Singapore Test Services (STS) in 1980 and Chartered Chemicals (CCI) in 1982. Shortly after the formation of CIS, the Defence Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, went on to set up several other government-linked defence industries to provide indigenous support for the SAF. One of them was Singapore Automotive Engineering (SAE). SAE was to support automotive-related services for the SAF, and its first immediate task was to service and maintain a fleet of V200 armored vehicles. By 1982, amidst a young, thriving Singapore economy and having built up its capability in automotive servicing and standards, SAE saw the potential in the commercial sector and decided to incorporate SAE Inspection Centre for vehicle inspection and servicing. The following year, Singapore Commuters, a taxi service, was formed. 1987‚Äì1996: Reformation On 20 August 1991, SAE was publicly listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. In the same year, SAE was renamed Singapore Technologies Automotive (ST Auto). STA Detroit Diesel-Allison was formed to take on the maintenance of the Detroit diesel engines and Allison transmission used in the Bionix as well as to distribute the Detroit Diesel parts in the Asian region. Singapore Commuters was merged with Singapore Airport Services Ltd (SABS Taxi Ltd) and Singapore Bus Service Taxi Pte Ltd (SBS Taxi Pte Ltd) to form CitiCab in April 1995. By 1996, CIS through its various subsidiaries were producing various ordnance for the SAF and for export overseas. Chartered Ammunition Industries (CAI) was producing small, medium and large caliber ammunition, explosives, pyrotechnics and anti-tank weapons. ODE was producing medium to large caliber weapon systems (mortars, medium caliber cannons, FH88, FH2000). Chartered Firearms Industries (CFI) was producing infantry and crew-served weapons, including the SR88A assault rifle, Ultimax 100, 7.62 mm GPMG, the 40 mm grenade launchers, and the 40/50 Cupola Weapon system. Allied Ordnance of Singapore (AOS) was offering a range of advanced low-level air defence equipment, including the 40 mm L70 air defense gun system, and missile and Optronic fire control systems. For the automotive business, ST Auto took on the AMX-13 Light Tank upgrading project, and refurbished the M113 APC, Commando V100 and V200 armored vehicles, LARC V amphibious. ST Auto also signed a contract with the SAF to overhaul, maintain and repair its military ground equipment. Singapore Test Services by then was offering specialized tests and inspection services to both military and civilian customers. 1997‚Äìpresent: Reinvention In 1997, ST Auto, together with Singapore Technologies Aerospace Ltd (ST Aerospace), Singapore Technologies Electronics Ltd (ST Electronics), and Singapore Technologies Marine Ltd (ST Marine), were merged to form the present ST Engineering. In October 1999, ST Engineering acquired CIS at S$78 M. ST Auto and CIS were merged in Feb 2000 to form ST Kinetics. The following year, ST Kinetics reorganised itself into 3 divisions, namely Automotive; Munitions and Weapons; and Services, Trading and Others. A series of flagship products were developed by the early 21st century, including the SAR21 assault rifle, the Primus 155mm self-propelled artillery gun, the Pegasus 155 mm lightweight howitzer, the Bronco All-Terrain Tracked Carrier and the Terrex 8√ó8 Armoured Personnel Carrier. ST Kinetics went on to invest in several companies overseas to enhance its engineering capabilities. An example was the acquisition of Silvatech Industries Inc in July 2006, a Canadian company specialising in forestry equipment, and renaming it as Kinetics Drive Solutions (KDS) in August 2006 to focus on the Infinitely Variable Transmissions (IVT) that Silvatech had developed for its forestry equipment. 2003 was the year ST Kinetics decided to venture into the new commercial vehicles business to leverage on the engineering and fabrication capabilities it has acquired through the military vehicle projects. That year, ST Kinetics went into an equal-share joint venture with Beijing Heavy Duty Truck Plant (BHDTP) to form the Beijing Zhonghuan Kinetics Heavy Vehicles Co. Ltd (BZK). In 2005, ST Kinetics acquired Specialized Vehicles Corporation in U.S. along with its Hackney and Kidron brands, 2 market leaders in the U.S. beverage truck bodies business. In the same year, ST Kinetics signed a 60‚Äì40 joint venture with Guiyang City Industrial Investment Holding Corporation (GIIHC) to form Guizhou Jonyang Kinetics Co., Ltd. (GJK) that manufactures excavators, and set up STAR Guangzhou and STAR Hangzhou. In June 2006, ST Kinetics wholly acquired Leeboy through ST Engineering's U.S. subsidiary, VT Systems. Leeboy is a U.S. industry leader in commercial class asphalt pavers. In 2012, ST Kinetics reorganised itself into 2 business groups. The Defence Business Group handles all military business and the Commercial Business Group manages the commercial businesses. On 5 March 2012, ST Kinetics is one of 6 companies that were blacklisted by India's Ministry of Defence for 10 years. The company was issued a show cause notice before it was blacklisted. On 25 May 2012, ST Kinetics filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi against the Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Indian Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), challenging the debarment order. In February 2013, ST Kinetics appointed Tata International as its distributor in Africa, thus expanding its distribution and customer support network for both its LeeBoy and TRXBUILD brands in 13 other countries. In the same year, ST Kinetics established 2 new overseas subsidiaries in Brazil and Myanmar. In July, the company acquired Technicae Projetos e Servicos Automotivos for BRL1.04 million. This acquisition will expand the company's reach into Brazil's growing defence business. Established in November 2013, the wholly owned subsidiary, Kinetics Automotive & Specialty Equipment Co., Ltd (KASE) was set up in Yangon, Myanmar. This Myanmar subsidiary will serve as a platform to introduce and support ST Kinetics' automotive and specialty vehicles products and services in Myanmar's burgeoning economy, as part of its plan to grow its commercial business in the country. Ordnance=M16S1 5.56 mm assault rifle The M16S1 is the M16A1 rifle made under license by STELS. It was the standard issue weapon of the Singapore Armed Forces and being replaced by the newer SAR 21 in most branches. It is, however, the standard issue weapon in reserve forces. Ultimax 100 5.56 mm section automatic weapon The Ultimax 100 was designed by L. James Sullivan, who previously had redesigned Eugene Stoner's 7.62 mm AR10 assault rifle into a smaller 5.56 mm version, the M16. The Ultimax 100 was considered by experts as one of the most manageable light machine guns in the world. The Ultimax 100 makes use of Sullivan's patented counter recoil mechanism that makes the Ultimax 100 \\"not just a manageable full-automatic weapon, but a machine gun that can be aimed\\".Richard J (2008), page 399.Andrew C (August 1989). SAR 21 5.56mm assault rifle In the mid 90s, the SAF decided to develop an indigenous rifle to replace the aging M16S1, most of which had been in service since the 70s. The other option was to procure new‚Äîand more expensive‚Äîweapons, with the chief contender being the M16A2. The Advanced Combat Rifle was conceived, and it eventually became the SAR 21. The SAR 21 is the first production assault rifle of its class to incorporate a built-in Laser Aiming Device (LAD) (powered by a single \\"AA\\" battery) as standard. The rifle incorporates various patented safety features, such as a Kevlar cheek plate and overpressure vent that protects the shooter in the unlikely event of a chamber explosion or catastrophic failure. It also has an integral 1.5√ó optical scope that is built into its carrying handle. The scope aids in target acquisition, particularly under low light conditions. The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users. This minimizes non-training range time to zero the weapons and maximises live-firing training hours.Richard J (2008), page 316.

Claimed to be the shortest bullpup rifle in the world with a 14.5-inch barrel, the BMCR provides ease and comfort for soldiers to manipulate in tight spaces. The BMCR is designed to fire NATO SS109 5.56mm ammunition and ST Kinetics' Extended Range 5.56mm ammunition, and come standard with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails at the three, six, nine and 12 o‚Äôclock positions. The rifle is fully ambidextrous and possesses flexibility for assault, marksman and suppressive roles. The weapon was renamed as the BR18, is scheduled to be in production by 2018. Conventional Multirole Combat Rifle (CMCR) The Conventional Multirole Combat Rifle on display at the Singapore Airshow 2014 The 5.56mm Conventional Multirole Combat Rifle (CMCR) was released during the Singapore Airshow 2014. Equipped with a unique adjustable and foldable buttstock, the CMCR provides ease and comfort for soldiers to manipulate in tight spaces. The CMCR is designed to fire NATO SS109 5.56mm ammunition and ST Kinetics' Extended Range 5.56mm ammunition, and come standard with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny Rails at the three, six, nine and 12 o‚Äôclock positions. Compact Personal Weapon (CPW) The CPW is a lightweight, multi-caliber Submachine Gun (SMG)/Personal Defence Weapon (PDW) for Close Quarters Combat (CQB/CQC) operations as well as engagements up to 150m. The CPW is available in 9mm Parabellum (9√ó19mm NATO) caliber for now and \\"resembles an updated/modernized MP7A1\\". The main differences are the angled pistol grip of the CPW for enhanced ergonomics and natural aiming, and a transparent rear magazine so that the operator can see the rounds remaining. Other features include a skeletonised trigger, a full-length Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny top rail for mounting accessories such as optics and lasers, and a shorter bottom rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting a vertical foregrip. The CPW weighs only 1.5 kg empty/dry (2 kg with a fully loaded 30-round 9 mm magazine) and uses a unique bolt lever cam recoil mitigation system to control recoil and muzzle rise to increase target hits. Full-auto cyclic rate of fire is a relatively high 900 to 1100 rpm. 40 mm weapon and munition systems ST Kinetics is one of the few producers of both 40 mm munition and weapon systems. The range of 40 mm rounds include low velocity, high velocity, less-than-lethal, camera, self-destruct, airburst and enhanced blast insensitive explosive rounds. There are currently 3 weapon systems available, namely the 40 mm Grenade Launcher (40GL), the 40 mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (40AGL) and the 40 mm Lightweight Automatic Grenade Launcher (40LWAGL, a portable version that is half the weight of conventional AGLs). The 40AGL was made in 1990, followed by the 40LWAGL in 2001 (previously called the 40 mm Super Light Weight AGL). The 40AGL is mounted in combination with the 12.7-mm 50MG in the ST Kinetics' 40/50 cupola weapon system, installed on the M113 and Bionix. The 40AGL weighs 33 kg without mount or ammunition. The objective of ST Kinetics in designing the 40LWAGL was to keep the grenade launcher's weight to below 20 kg, or half the weight of conventional AGLs. Prototype weapons weighed around 14 kg and small quantities have been sold to a few countries, including Sweden, mostly for evaluation. St Kinetics is also collaborating with Australia's Metal Storm and Electro Optics System to develop a new high-speed and recoilless 40 mm grenade launcher called the Redback Lightweight. The company is reportedly the world's largest producer of the 40AGL, with more than 2,000 of the 40AGLs sold to the SAF and overseas customers.From bullet maker to defence tech giant, The Sunday Times, 30 December 2007, page 26 In 2008, the company entered into a teaming agreement with Electro-Optic Systems (EOS) and Metal Storm (MS) to develop a 3-shot under-barrel grenade launcher called the 3GL. The 3GL is intended to replace the M203 under barrel grenade launcher for most military rifles including the M16, AK-47, SAR 21 and Steyr AUG. It can also be detached to operate as a stand-alone weapon. In September 2013, Thales and ST Kinetics agreed to develop, manufacture and market ST Kinetics' 40mm low-velocity air-bursting ammunition for the Australian and New Zealand markets. ST Kinetics also announced that the company secured a total of more than US$30 million worth of international orders from Canada and United States for its 40mm ammunition in October 2013. 50MG machine gun STK 50 HMG The 50MG was developed in the 1980s by CIS to replace the obsolete Browning M2HB machine guns used by the SAF. The CIS engineers learnt from the lesson of the unsuccessful American \\"Dover Devil GPHMG\\" programme, to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. They succeeded and in 1988, CIS introduced the new machine gun and simply named it as the \\"CIS 50MG\\". The SAF used the 50MG in its infantry regiments and as a mounted weapon on armoured vehicles and naval craft. The STK 50MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon. It has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a carrying handle. The gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed on either side of the barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The STK 50MG utilizes the same \\"constant recoil\\" system used in the Ultimax 100. A unique feature of the 50MG is its dual belt- feed system that allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball to armor-piercing Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP). Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons.Richard J (2008), page 398.Andrew C (October 1989). 120 mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS) The 120SRAMS is developed specifically for rapid and close range requirements of the battlefield. The semi-automatic Ammunition Transfer System and the patented Valve System in the breech mechanism provides an effective vent for the trapped air to let the bomb \\"free-fall\\" into the barrel. This reduces the projectile's in-bore travel and reportedly allows the 120SRAM to achieve the highest continuous firing rate of up to 18 rounds per minute‚Äî3 times faster than a conventional mortar system which can fire up to 6 rounds per minute. Recent product information has indicated the firing rate at a more modest 10 rounds per minute. The patented Cooling System is able to reduce the temperature that builds up in the barrel quickly to enable continuous firing without blockage. The patented Blast Diffuser reduces the blast overpressure by about 8 to 10 decibels. The 120SRAM is also currently the only system in the world with a recoil of less than 20 tonnes, which allows the 120SRAM to be mounted on board a 4√ó4 wheeled vehicle. The 120SRAM has a navigation and positioning system, power gun drives and integrated with an automatic fire control system, which require just a 3-person crew to operate the weapon. FH-2000 field howitzer The FH-2000 is a 155 mm 52-calibre towed howitzer gun and the \\"first 52 calibre field howitzer in service and in series production\\". Designed and built locally in Singapore by CIS, the FH-2000 deploys a crew of 8 and can use a low-powered self-propelled engine to travel at 10 km/h without towing. It fires projectiles to a maximum range of 42 km using special extended range ammunition that was field tested in New Zealand. Pegasus 155mm lightweight howitzer The Pegasus is the world's first heli-portable 155 mm 39 calibre self-propelled light howitzer, capable of offering aerial mobility for shoot and scoot. The Pegasus' automatic ammunition loading system, advanced sight, lightweight material and innovative recoil management make the Pegasus highly survivable, fast to deploy and easy to use. Primus self-propelled artillery Primus on display The Singapore Self-Propelled Howitzer 1 (SSPH 1) Primus is a self-propelled artillery unit armed with a 155 mm howitzer jointly developed by the SAF, Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and ST Kinetics. Primus provides the range, firepower and accuracy of the artillery while keeping its weight below 30 tons and width below 3m. Other self-propelled guns such as the U.S. (M109 Paladin), Britain's (AS90 Braveheart), Japan's (Type 75) and Russia's (2S3M1) were either too heavy, at over 50 tons, or too wide, beyond 3m, for the tropical rainforest and swampy terrains. The chassis is based on the proven United Defense M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzer, with a new power pack similar to the one fitted on the Bionix infantry fighting vehicle (IFV). The power pack consists of a Detroit Diesel Corporation 6V 92TIA diesel engine developing 550 hp coupled to a General Dynamics Land Systems HMPT-500-3EC fully automatic transmission. The maximum road speed of the Primus is 50 km/h, with an operating range of 350 km, its combat weight is of 28.3 tons allows it to use the SAF 's current military bridging systems. The Primus could be deployed by the future Airbus A400M Transport aircraft. Bionix armoured fighting vehicle The Bionix was the first local armoured fighting vehicle, designed and developed by ST Kinetics. It is a medium-weight tracked vehicle, weighing between twenty-two to twenty-eight tonnes, to replace the aging M-113A2 armoured personnel carriers. The Bionix was commissioned by the SAF in September 1997 and operated under the 42nd Battalion of the Singapore Armoured Regiment (42 SAR). During the commissioning parade in July 1999, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony Tan, declared the Bionix IFV to be \\"a highly effective indigenous armoured vehicle\\". The Bionix was eventually succeeded by the Bionix II, which was jointly developed by the SAF, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), and ST Kinetics. Bronco all-terrain tracked carrier The Bronco is manufactured by ST Kinetics for the Singaporean Army and in small amounts as an UOR for the British Army in Afghanistan. The company is also manufacturing the firefighter and other civilian variants of the ATTC under its U.S. subsidiary, Hackney where it is positioned as a disaster recovery vehicle with its ability to access uneven and soft terrains impassable to normal vehicles after earthquakes, floods or other major urban catastrophes. Another commercial variant, the All Terrain Tracked Emergency-Engineering Car ÂÖ®Âú∞ÂΩ¢Â±•Â∏¶ÂºèÂ∑•Á®ãÊä¢Èô©, is also under development by its China subsidiary, GJK, in a bid to leverage on China's cost advantage. Competition would include the Russian Vityaz DT-(10/20/30)P models and BAe Hagglunds' BVS10. Terrex AV81 8√ó8 AFV The Terrex AV81 is an armoured fighting vehicle weighing between 25 and 30 tons an 8√ó8 wheeled chassis and modern armour. Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It is designed to be air-portable by C-130s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent double wishbone suspension, which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external V-hull that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully amphibious. Two water jets mounted on either side at the back of the hull propel the vehicle through water at 10 km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. Interim Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging V-200 armoured vehicles. The Indonesian Army also indicated plans to purchase 420 units and to produce the Terrex under license locally. Hunter armoured fighting vehicle The Hunter was jointly developed with Defence Science and Technology Agency, and the Singapore Army. Intended to replace the Singapore Army's aging Ultra M113 armoured personnel carriers, it was commissioned in 2019. It is the Singapore Army's first fully digitalised platform and is designed to provide armoured forces with enhanced capabilities to operate more effectively and efficiently in various phases of military operations.

Originally raised as part of the First Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, the battalion formed part of the 1st Brigade, attached to the 1st Division. During the war the battalion fought at Gallipoli and in the trenches on the Western Front, before being disbanded in 1919. In 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a militia unit and designated as the \\"4th Battalion (Australian Rifles)\\", adopting the designation of the Australian Rifles militia unit from which many of the battalion's recruits had come during the war. In 1930, the battalion was amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion (Werriwa Regiment) and they remained linked until 1936, when they were delinked. During the Second World War, the 4th Battalion formed part of the 8th Brigade. Initially the battalion was used as garrison troops in Australia, serving in Western Australia, in early 1944 they were deployed to New Guinea as part of the 5th Division, where they participated in the Huon Peninsula and Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaigns, before returning to Australia in early 1946 and were subsequently disbanded. In 1957, the battalion was re-raised as part of the Citizens Military Force, perpetuating the battle honours of the previously existing units that had fought during the First and Second World Wars. In 1960, with the introduction of the Pentropic organisation into the Australian Army and the subsequent formation of the Royal New South Wales Regiment the battalion was absorbed into the 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming that unit's 'D' and 'E' Companies. In 1965, the battalion was reformed as the \\"4th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment\\" and it remained in existence until 1987 when it was once again amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion to form the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains in existence today. Lineage Like many Australian infantry units, the 4th Battalion has a convoluted lineage and can trace its origins back to two separate units of the New South Wales colonial forces. The first of these units is the Newtown Volunteer Rifle Regiment which was formed in 1862, while the second is the Ashfield Volunteer Reserve Corps, which was raised in 1885. In 1914, these units‚Äîwhich had evolved through a series of reorganisations and redesignations into the 29th Infantry (Australian Rifles) and the 37th and 38th Infantry Regiments‚Äîwere the basis upon which the 4th Battalion, AIF, was raised, although these units continued to exist throughout the war. In 1918, these units were redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 36th Infantry Regiment, and the 5th Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment. In 1919, the 4th Battalion, AIF, was disbanded and in 1921 the two militia units were amalgamated and re- raised as the 4th Battalion (Australian Rifles), perpetuating the battle honours of the AIF unit. After that the battalion existed as a distinct entity (except for a period in the 1930s when it was amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion) up until 1946 when it was disbanded. Following the war the unit was not re-raised until 1957, however, when it was raised from the 7th/21st Australian Horse Regiment and the 56th Battalion (Riverina Regiment), which had been formed in 1948 and 1956 respectively as part of the Citizens Military Force, and thus further confusing the unit's lineage. The battalion also inherited the battle honours of the 2/4th Battalion, which had been raised from volunteers for overseas service from the 4th Battalion during the Second World War. Between 1960 and 1965, the battalion was subsumed into the 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a Pentropic battalion that is distinct to the 3rd Battalion itself, before being re-raised in its own right in 1965 as the 4th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment. History=First World War Because of the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, following the outbreak of the war the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force outside of the existing militia units that already existed.Grey 2008, p. 85. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and it was used to fight overseas in Europe and the Middle East, while the militia remained in Australia on home service. Nevertheless, many members of the militia joined the AIF and were allocated to AIF units on a territorial basis. As a result, many of the AIF battalions adopted the identities of their associated militia units. The 4th Battalion was raised in New South Wales within two weeks of the start of the war, with many of its recruits being drawn from the 29th Infantry Regiment (Australian Rifles) and the 37th and 38th Infantry Regiments. The majority of these personnel came from inner Sydney, although the battalion also drew men from Albury, Cootamundra, Goulburn and Wagga Wagga.Austin 2007, p. 18. Members of the 4th Battalion landing at Gallipoli Initially, the battalion concentrated at Randwick, Sydney, forming the 1st Brigade along with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions. After only two months training the battalion was among the first Australian units to be deployed overseas, arriving in Egypt on 2 December 1914. After this the battalion undertook further training and took part in the defence of the Suez Canal before taking part in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 as part of the second and third waves. The following day, its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Astley Thompson, who had only just taken over from the adjutant Captain Iven Mackay who had been commanding the battalion temporarily in Thompson's absence, was killed in action. In August, the battalion took part in the attack on Lone Pine after which they were involved in the defensive stalemate that ensued until they were evacuated from the peninsula along with the rest of the force in December 1915. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF underwent a period of expansion and reorganisation. In March 1916, the 4th Battalion, along with the rest of the 1st Division, was transferred to the European theatre of operations where for the next two and a half years the battalion served in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium. The battalion's first major action in France was at Pozi√®res in July 1916. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter, where they were used in a mainly defensive role. In 1918 the battalion helped to stop the German spring offensive in March and April. From 14‚Äì26 March Alick Bryant, who is believed to have been the youngest Australian soldier to serve during the war, was posted to the battalion while it fought in the Somme Valley. The battalion subsequently participated in the final Allied offensive of the war‚Äîthe Hundred Days Offensive‚Äîwhich was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, when the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation. The battalion was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities the battalion returned to Australia between November 1918 and May 1919 for demobilisation and discharge. During the war, the battalion suffered 3,485 casualties, of which 1,203 were killed. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, five Distinguished Service Orders with one Bar, 28 Military Crosses with one Bar, 20 Distinguished Conduct Medals with one Bar, 125 Military Medals with four Bars, seven Meritorious Service Medals, 68 Mentions in Despatches, and seven foreign awards. Inter-war years During the war while the units of the AIF had been deployed overseas, the militia had remained in Australia on home service, during which they were called up to provide service at installations considered vital to the war effort such as ports, military bases and ammunition factories, as well as manning coastal defences.Scott 1941, p. 196. Over the course of the war, although there was some attempt to limit the numbers of militiamen joining the AIF, especially in the trades considered vital to national defence such as garrison artillery and engineers,Scott 1941, p. 197. large numbers of the militia volunteered for service with the AIF during the war, to the extent that many militia units ceased to exist in as effective units. As a result, during the war the compulsory training scheme was temporarily suspended in September 1915 and it was not until late in the war that it began again in ernest.Scott 1941, pp. 196‚Äì197. Following the recommencement of the compulsory training scheme in 1918 there was a reorganisation of the militia in Australia. As a result of this a number of changes were made, including the designations of many of the infantry regiments of the militia which were expanded to become multi- battalion regiments and were redesignated. As a part of these changes the 29th Infantry Regiment (Australian Rifles) was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion, 36th Infantry Regiment, while the 40th Infantry Regiment (which had been formed in 1915 from the 37th and 38th Infantry Regiments) was redesignated as the 5th Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment. By mid-1919 most of the AIF battalions had been disbanded, however, it was not until 1 April 1921 that the AIF itself was officially disbanded.Grey 2008, p. 125. In May 1921 the militia was reorganised once more, and the previously existing militia units were redesignated in order to preserve the battle honours and identities of their associated AIF units. As a result of this decision and due to the links that the 4th Battalion, AIF, had with the 2nd Battalion, 36th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, these two militia units were amalgamated and redesignated as the 4th Battalion. In 1927 the battalion readopted its territorial designation, becoming the 4th Battalion (Australian Rifles).Austin 2007, pp. 191‚Äì192. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended once again and it was decided that the militia would be maintained on a voluntary, part-time basis only.Grey 2008, p. 138. Coupled with the economic hardships of the time due to the Great Depression and the general lack of importance placed upon defence matters at the time by the government and the public, the militia's numbers fell and a number of units were amalgamated. The 4th Battalion was one of these units, being amalgamated with the 3rd Battalion (Werriwa Regiment) in 1930, beginning an association that continues today. In 1937, the battalion was delinked and became a separate unit once more.Festberg 1972, p. 61. Second World War As had happened during the First World War, when the Second World War began the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). From the outset it was decided to raise this force with little impact upon the militia, as it was felt that there was a need to build up the defences in Australia due to concerns that Britain might not be able to fulfill its pledge to defend Singapore if the Japanese were to attack.Grey 2008, pp. 145‚Äì147. As a result, initially there was a cap placed on the number of militiamen that were allowed to join the 2nd AIF. Nevertheless, large numbers of militiamen did volunteer for service and in an effort to preserve the territorial identity of the militia units, many men from the 4th Battalion were allocated to the 2/4th Battalion, AIF, which was raised at Ingleburn, New South Wales, in October 1939. In January 1940, the compulsory training scheme which had been suspended since 1929 was reintroduced and militia units were progressively called up for three month periods of full-time service in order to improve their readiness in case they were to be called upon to fight.Grey 2008, p. 146. The 4th Battalion (Australian Rifles) was mobilised in early 1942 following Japan's entry into the war and in June 1942 they concentrated at Greta, New South Wales, forming the 8th Brigade along with the 30th and 35th Battalions. A month later the brigade was moved to Western Australia where they remained for the next two years, carrying out various garrison duties such as training, building and manning defensive positions and providing a labour force. During this time it was stationed at various locations along the coast between Bunbury and Geraldton and formed part of the 2nd Division. Troops from the 4th Battalion using a captured Japanese staff car on patrol, Hansa Bay, June 1944. At the end of 1943 the 8th Brigade was moved to North Queensland and in January 1944, it was reallocated to the 5th Division and deployed to New Guinea. The 4th Battalion was the first unit from the brigade to arrive and after relieving the 2/17th Battalion at Sio it began the task of clearing the coast between there at Saidor, in order to support the 9th Division's campaign on the Huon Peninsula. In early February, they had completed this objective and were relieved by the 30th Battalion at Crossingtown. As the campaign progressed the 8th Brigade was tasked with clearing the Madang‚ÄìBagadjim area and the 4th Battalion carried out patrols between the Maclay River and Bostrem Bay. In May, the brigade went on the offensive against the Japanese forces located to the north of Alexishafen in order to support the 6th Division's campaign in the Aitape‚ÄìWewak region. In mid June, the 4th Battalion took over the advance and occupied Bogia, Potsdam and Hansa Bay. In October, following the end of hostilities, they were moved to Wewak as the demobilisation process began. The last members of the battalion departed for Australia on 24 January 1946 and the battalion was subsequently disbanded. During the war the battalion suffered 39 casualties, of which 15 were killed. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Military Medals and six Mentions in Despatches. Post Second World War In 1948, the militia was re-raised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF),Grey 2008, p. 200. however, the 4th Battalion was not re-raised until 1957 when it was formed in the Riverina District of New South Wales from the 7th/21st Australian Horse and the 56th Battalion (Riverina Regiment). The national service scheme had been reintroduced in 1951;Grey 2008, p. 205. however, it was suspended once more in 1960. At the same the Australian Army was reorganised with the introduction of the Pentropic divisional structure and the old regional militia units subsumed into six State-based regiments.Grey 2008, p. 228. As a result, the CMF was greatly reduced in size and many infantry units were absorbed into the new battalions that were organised according to the Pentropic establishment.As a result of the reduced manpower and reorganisation the number of infantry battalions fell from 31 to 17. The 4th Battalion was subsumed into the 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming two companies‚Äî'D' Company (Australian Rifles) and 'E' Company (Riverina Company).Festberg 1972, pp. 61‚Äì62. In 1965, the Pentropic system was discontinued and the CMF reorganised again.Grey 2008, p. 239. As a result of this reorganisation the existing battalions were reduced in size and a number of new battalions were raised in more populous areas in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. As a result, the 4th Battalion was re-raised in its own right on 1 July 1965, becoming the 4th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (4 RNSWR). As 4 RNSWR the battalion remained on the order of battle until 1987 when a further reorganisation of the Australian Army Reserve saw it amalgamated with 3 RNSWR once again, forming 4/3 RNSWR,Shaw 2010, pp. 11‚Äì12. a unit that continues to exist as part of the 5th Brigade, attached to the 2nd Division.Austin 2007, p. 192.

This transition is supported by the discovery of contemporary coin hoards, and more particularly of a coin hoard found on the Acropolis in 1886.Yannis Stoyas, Archaeologist ‚Äì numismatist, The coinages of Athens The Athenian tetradrachm was widely used in transactions throughout the ancient Greek world, including in cities politically unfriendly to Athens. Athens had silver mines in state ownership, which provided the bullion. Most well known were the silver mines of Laurium at a close distance from Athens.Aristotle, Athenian Constitution, 22.7 The Athenian tetradrachm was stamped with the head of Athena on the obverse, and on the reverse the image of the owl of Athena, the iconographic symbol of the Athenian polis, with a sprig of olive and a crescent for the moon. According to Philochorus, it was known as glaux (Œ≥ŒªŒ±œçŒæ, little owl)Œ≥ŒªŒ±œçŒæ, Liddell & Scott throughout the ancient worldPhilochorus: Scholion to Aristophanes, Birds 1106. and \\"owl\\" in present-day English language numismatics.Kraay, C.M. The archaic owls of Athens: classification and chronology. The design was kept essentially unchanged for over two centuries, by which time it had become stylistically archaic. To differentiate their currency from the rival coinage of Aegina using the Aeginetic stater of about 12.3 grams, Athens minted its tetradrachm based on the \\"Attic\\" standard of 4.3 grams per drachma. The vast number of \\"owls-tetradrachms\\" available those days mainly from the silver mines of Laurium financed the several achievements of Athens, such as the reconstruction of the Acropolis and building the Parthenon, as well as many wars, including the Peloponnesian War.

With the armies of Alexander the Great it spread to other Greek-influenced areas of Asia. Tetradrachms were common as trade coins. Gallery File:Tetradrachme van Aetna (tweede kwart 5e eeuw v.C.)

Over the next few decades, the colonies of New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania), and Victoria were created from New South Wales, as well as an aborted Colony of North Australia. On 1 January 1901, these colonies, excepting New Zealand, became states in the Commonwealth of Australia. Since federation, the internal borders have remained mostly stable, except for the creation of some territories with limited self-government: the Northern Territory from South Australia, to govern the vast, sparsely populated centre of the country; the split of the Northern Territory into Central Australia and North Australia, and then the quick merger of those back into the Northern Territory; and the Australian Capital Territory, a federal district ceded from New South Wales. Outside of the continent, Queensland attempted an expansion into New Guinea, but British authorities rejected this; the claim would later be made a British protectorate and ceded to Australia. The League of Nations mandated northeast New Guinea to Australia after World War I, as well as Nauru, which was placed under joint Australian-British-New Zealand jurisdiction. These mandates (and, later, United Nations trust territories) became the independent nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea in the mid-20th century. Australia has also obtained several small island territories, mainly from earlier British colonies, and has a large claim on Antarctica.

The area of studies additionally emphasizes the importance of Chican@ educational materials taught by Chican@ educators for Chican@ students. In many universities across the United States, Chicana/o Studies is linked with other ethnic studies, such as Black Studies, Asian American Studies, and Native American Studies. Many students who have studied anthropology have also been involved in varying degrees of Chicana/o studies. Today, most major universities in areas of high Chicana/o concentration have a formal Chicana/o studies department or interdisciplinary program. Providing Chican@ studies to Chican@ students has helped these students find a community which offers a curriculum that is unique to their own heritage.  Background  The establishment of Chican@ studies in colleges and universities was in response to fundamental issues in the American educational system and how many Chican@s felt excluded from educational success in the United States. Specifically, one of the issues that led to the establishment of Chican@ studies was how Mexican-Americans, and in turn the greater Latinx community, were represented negatively in American history. An example where Mexican- Americans were portrayed negatively in American history is during the 19th century, when the territories of New Mexico and Arizona were not allowed to become states until there were more people of European descent living there to balance out the Mexican-Americans, who were thought of as lazy, talentless idlers. It also must be noted that these stereotypes have continued throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Additionally, Chican@ scholars such as Felipe de Ortego y Gasca claim that Mexican-Americans are not seen as vital parts of general American history, but neglect to remember that after historical treaties such as the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, land originally belonging to Mexico has been a part of the United States for an extended period of time, and that those of Mexican descent have been \\"American\\" for over 160 years. Therefore, many Chican@ scholars feel the need to have necessary programming that restructures the way in which Mexican-Americans are perceived in American education. Another reason for Chican@ studies was that traditionally Mexican-Americans had been exposed to \\"Western\\" culture and European history through the standard educational system, but those of European descent had never had to learn Mexican history or the history of Mexican-Americans. Additionally, the little material the European-American community was taught about Mexican-Americans was framed in the context of European-American narratives, in other words meaning that the historical focus was not placed on Mexican-Americans and Mexican-Americans were often portrayed negatively. For that reason, Chican@ studies was created to combat traditional education that excludes Mexican-American history and furthers harmful stereotypes about Mexican-Americans. Furthermore, Chican@ studies was created to ensure Chican@ students have access to Chican@ education that is taught by Chican@s. In addition to the exclusion of Mexican-American narratives in American education and the negative perceptions of Mexican-Americans, professors and educators in higher education were rarely Chican@. Even at the nascency of Chican@ studies, the first teachers of this material were the only Chican@ professors at the institution. Therefore, another reason Chican@ studies was implemented at colleges and universities was to ensure diversity in the faculty of higher education and to demonstrate to Chican@ students that professional careers surrounding education can be an option for them as well. History= 1960s  Rudy Acuna work emphasizes the struggle of the Mexican American people. Many Chican@ scholars agree that Chican@ studies came about as a result of the Chicana@ student movements, whether they were in the form of protests, activism or just taking part in el movimiento, also known as the Chicano movement. Chican@ studies was seen as a way to advance Mexican American perspectives on culture, history and literature. The major push for universities and colleges to include Chican@ studies came within the context of the African-American civil rights struggle. During the 1960s, Mexican American educators demanded that colleges and universities address the pedagogical needs of Mexican American students. Scholar Rodolfo Acu√±a noted that this was especially important because Mexican American student populations grew significantly in the 1960s. In addition, many young people and students were becoming very politically active and began to organize for political causes. A student organization that grew out of the civil rights movements of the '60s was the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), which began to work towards educational reform. MAYO was very active in promoting student walkouts in Texas and California to highlight problems that Mexican American students faced. As students became more organized, they began to develop \\"experimental colleges\\" where informal classes on topics important to the Chican@ movement were taught. In 1963, Manuel H. Guerra, professor at the University of Southern California and chair of the Mexican American Political Association's (MAPA) Education Committee, reported on \\"serious discriminatory policies and practices\\" at his university in relation to hiring Mexican Americans, especially considering that there had been an increase in the number of Mexican American students. According to scholar Rodolfo Acu√±a, serving Mexican American students without providing Mexican American faculty was considered a sort of colonialism and cultural assimilation. In addition, many Mexican American students were put at a disadvantage because speaking Spanish (even outside of class) was considered \\"degrading\\" or \\"un-American.\\" Opportunities such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) helped increase the number of minorities entering colleges and universities. Educators and students alike began to visualize \\"an academic program that could serve and transform the Mexican American community,\\" a program that would become Chican@ studies and which was built by and for Chican@s. In 1967, anthropologist Octavio Romano and Nick C. Vaca, in addition to graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley, began to publish a Chican@ studies journal called El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought. Many of the ideas surrounding the formation of later Chican@ studies programs stemmed from this publication. One major idea that was put forth in El Grito by its editors was that Mexican Americans, in contrast to other ethnic groups, have kept their Mexican-American culture intact and have \\"refused to disappear into The Great American Melting Pot.\\" The consequence of this, said the editors, was that Mexican Americans were kept in an economically and politically impoverished state. Also in 1967, political scientist Ralph Guzm√°n conducted a study with the Los Angeles State College which laid the foundation for a national center of Mexican American studies at California State College, Los Angeles (CSCLA). Both Mexican American and Black Student Unions pressed CSCLA to have ethnic studies classes at this time. The Plan de Santa Barbara is generally considered to be the manifesto of Chican@ studies. Drafted in 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the plan emphasizes the need for education, and especially higher education to enact Chican@ community empowerment. The Plan helped to \\"establish Chicana/o studies as an entity incorporated into the structures of academia.\\" However, while the Plan articulated a need for education, it did not specify how to create a program of study. The Plan did, however, lead to the creation of the Chican@ Studies Institute in 1969. Another important document in Chican@ studies was also produced in 1969. In the March of 1969, the Chican@ Youth Conference held in Denver produced a plan written by Chican@ poet, Alurista. It was called El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n (The Spiritual Plan of Aztl√°n) and it contains a concept of \\"ethnic nationalism and self-determination.\\" The idea of the mythic homeland of the Aztec people, Aztl√°n, is one that unifies the United States and Mexico and correspondingly, united Mexican Americans with a sense of nationalism.  1970s  In 1970, the first volume of Aztl√°n: A Journal of Chicano Studies was published by students at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Aztl√°n had a big influence on the discourse surrounding Chican@ studies and was the reason behind the founding of many Chican@ studies in colleges and universities. The name of the journal came directly from El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n and under the direction of the historian Juan Gomez-Qui√±ones, the journal supported and sustained a culture of activism. Chican@ scholars in 1970 also wrote papers for the Chicano Studies Institute which were later published in the journal, Epoca. These papers addressed topics such as Chican@ curriculum, goals of the educational program and how to achieve academic recognition. As Chican@ studies programs began to be implemented at universities, it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support. In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chican@ studies programs, and in a more general sense to have academic spaces for Chican@ studies and Chican@ students. Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students, finding that Mexican-American students responded positively to Chican@ studies and also to bilingual classes. Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was \\"inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement\\" and that Chican@ studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems. It was also important to find ways to recruit Chican@ teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research. Further support for Chican@ studies came in the form of the National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) which was created in 1972 in San Antonio, Texas. The NACCS allows scholars in Chican@ studies to exchange ideas, share research, communicate, and it also has an annual conference. The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chican@ studies, since other disciplines have similar annual conferences. Through these conferences and the many other initiatives organized by Chican@ students and educators, many Chican@ studies programs were in place at major universities by 1975.  1980s  Chican@ studies went through structural shifts in its message and mission during the late 1970s and 1980s. During this period, Chican@ studies began to include women, the LGBTQ+ community, and other minority groups under the umbrella of \\"Chicano\\" while also acknowledging the many differences within the group. In 1981, the Mexican American Studies and Research Center (MASRC) at the University of Arizona was established. MASRC focused on contemporary applied public policy research on Mexican Americans. In 2009, MASRC became a department and continued public policy research and addressing issues of concern to Mexican American communities. As of 2019, MASRC is now known as the Department of Mexican American Studies and offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and a Ph.D. degree in Mexican American Studies. The idea of the \\"borderland\\" or nepantla grew stronger than the idea of Aztl√°n by the 1980s and Chican@s celebrated the many different (often conflicting) aspects of themselves. Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) by Gloria Anzald√∫a both grew out of and signifies this change. Chican@ studies became less about nationalism, and more about belonging to a group and contributing to \\"something greater.\\" This shift helped reshape the mission of Chican@ studies and gave it \\"new life\\" and \\"new authority.\\" The 1980s saw more Chican@ Studies programs integrated into institutions of higher learning while it also created a \\"canonical approach\\" to its studies and \\"gatekeeping procedures\\" to evaluate promotions and tenure. In addition, Chican@ studies programs helped universities and colleges fulfill Affirmative Action requirements. During the mid 1990s, however, a study found that most Chican@ studies programs were still very non-uniform. Part of the reason that many Chican@ studies programs were not consistent in what was studied is that a core curriculum had not yet been formally published. The first primer of Chican@ studies was published in 1980 by Diego Vigil, called From Indians to Chicanos: A Sociocultural History. In addition, there was a lack of Chican@ faculty with only 1.2% of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities having any \\"Hispanic\\" ethnicity at all in 1985. Many of the faculty teaching Chican@ studies didn't feel that their own programs were \\"qualitatively sound.\\"  2010s  In 2017, scholar S.M. Contreras noted a change in the language surrounding Chicana/o people, as they have begun to add an \\"X\\" or an \\"@\\" in place of the \\"a/o.\\" This new language is a result of the movement towards gender inclusivity and as a way to recognize Chican@ people whose gender identity does not coincide with the gender binary.  Ideological approaches  Francisco H. V√°zquez director of the Hutchins Institute for Public Policy Studies and Community Action. There are two ideological approaches to the institutionalization of Chican@ Studies as a formal discipline. The first approach is Pragmatism, an approach which emphasizes social responsibility and is supported by prominent scholar, Rodolfo Acu√±a. The second approach is Perspectivism, an approach which emphasizes introspection and is supported by prominent scholar, Michael Soldatenko.Soldatenko, Michael (2012). Chicano Studies- The Genesis of a Discipline. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.  Pragmatism  Pragmatism is an ideological approach to Chican@ studies. This ideology emphasizes political activism and social responsibility. Adherents to this approach believe it is the community‚Äôs job to insert themselves into the workings of the current educational system to demand formal recognition of Chican@ studies as a discipline. Additionally, it is vital that resources such as staff and offices are acquired in order to institutionalize the discipline. Rafael P√©rez-Torres, author of \\"Chicana/o Studies‚Äôs Two Paths\\", highlights that this approach has faced criticism due to its tendency to allow for the over politicization of Chican@ issues. He identifies the argument that it creates a forum focused on ‚Äúseparatist politics‚Äù and neglects the furtherance of the institutionalization of the field of study. In other words, the ideology fails to fulfill the aim of integrating Chican@ studies into the US educational system and, instead, places exclusive focus on the political issues surrounding ethnicity. However, Sarita E. Brown et al. argue that political mobilization is key to the Pragmatic approach. They contend that Chican@ political advocacy should emphasize the lobbying of government officials for pro-Chican@ studies policies. Rodolfo Acu√±a, former chair at the Department of Chican@ Studies at California State University, Northridge and prominent scholar in the field, fervently emphasizes the importance of sacrifice and struggle in order to institutionalize and gain formal respect for the field of Chican@ Studies. Acu√±a frames the quest for institutionalization as a gritty battle to be waged by students and faculty.  Perspectivism  Perspectivism is another ideological approach to Chican@ studies. This ideology emphasizes intellectualism, introspection, and academic expertise. This ideology neglects the needs for social change and, instead, exclusively focuses on engagement with relevant scholarship. Perspectivists believe individual ambition, pursuit of respect, and the studying of relevant Chican@ issues will lead to the institutionalization of Chican@ studies.Burrola, Luis Ramon and Jose A. Rivera. \\"Chicano Studies Programs at the Crossroads: Alternative Futures for the 1980s\\". (1983). Additionally, the creation of intellectual communities, research centers, and other forums for academe further validate the field of Chican@ studies. This validation continues to help facilitate the institutionalization of the discipline. In addition, Michael Soldatenko, the former chair of the Department of Chican@ Studies at California State University, Los Angeles and a prominent scholar in the field of Chican@ studies, has discovered a new popularity surrounding the perspectivist approach. The ideological approach to Chican@ studies has shifted from pragmatic to perspectivist since the 1970s. Thus, according to Soldatenko, the approach‚Äôs widespread popularity signals its significance to the furtherance of the field of Chican@ studies.  Responses to Chican@ studies = Positive  Responses to Chican@ studies and its impact on the greater American educational system can be separated into two categories, positive and negative. Those who see the programs and studies as positive believe that Chican@ studies create positive academic changes in Chican@ students. For example, Chican@ educator Curtis Acosta noted the shift in Chican@ students' minds after they were exposed to literature that was written by Chican@s and intended for Chican@s. For according to Acosta, Chican@s often felt excluded by traditional educational systems, and felt as if they are not meant for educational success, or that success is tied to \\"whiteness,\\" an educational standard that they can not attain. Acosta noted that the students that were exposed to Chican@ literature felt empowered and believed that educational success and higher education was meant for them. Therefore, those who view the studies as positive believe Chican@ education assists in Chican@ students' academic growth and in their realization that education is not inextricably linked to being white.  Negative  Those who view Chican@ studies as negative believe that the area of studies creates further problems for Chican@ students and the greater American educational system. Chican@ studies opposers cite that the education in Chican@ classes teach anti- whiteness and a disdain for those of European descent. In addition, opposers believe that Chican@ studies allow Mexican-American students to feel as if they are victims or sufferers of Anglo-America. Furthermore, some believe that having education dedicated for a certain type of student creates self- segregation and further separation from the non-Chican@, particularly white, students. Another type of criticism comes from some Chican@s as well, who believe that Chican@ studies create students who become bothersome activists and generate a new wave movement that is not needed or wanted. Either way, opposers of the studies remain a strong voice (in addition to the supporters) in the continued conversation surrounding Chican@ studies. Legal restrictions Protesters are seen in June 2011 in support of the Tucson Unified School District's Mexican-American studies program. A new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive. On May 11, 2010, the Governor of Arizona, Jan Brewer, signed House Bill 2281, or HB 2281. This bill prohibits course curricula within a school district or charter school from advocating ethnic solidarity or promoting insurgency, racism, or classism. Additionally, the course curriculum may not be designed exclusively for one ethnicity. However, Native American classes still comply with federal law. In addition, the grouping of classes based on academic performance is still permissible. Course curriculum concerning the history of a specific ethnic group or about controversial history which is available to all students is acceptable, as well. Another provision of the law stated that any school district or charter school breaching its stated provisions would be liable to lose state funding as a public institution. Subsequently, the Mexican-American studies program taught in the Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) was found to be in violation of House Bill 2281 by the former Arizona Superintendent, Tom Horne. On the contrary, an independent audit, paid for by the state of Arizona, found the program was not in violation of HB 2281. However, after TUSD issued an appeal stating the program was in violation, Superintendent John Huppenthal decided that the course must be disbanded instead of relinquishing state funding. Thus, in January 2012, the TUSD school board came to a 4-1 decision that the program was to be disbanded as to not lose state funding for the district. Furthermore, HB 2281 facilitated more challenges and limitations on classes teaching Chicana/o studies not just in Arizona, but across the United States.

Coat of arms of Duchy of Bavaria The Bavarian national uprising against the imperial occupation of 1705/06 is well- known (in Germany) from the episode of the \\"Christmas massacre at Sendling\\" and the folk tale of the Smith of Kochel. It is less well known that this uprising in Upper Bavaria was only a small part of a larger uprising, which dominated huge areas of Lower Bavaria, the area around the Inn River (Innviertel) and the whole of eastern Upper Bavaria. The cities and fortresses lying in these regions were conquered and the rebellion of the peasants encroached on the Bavarian Forest and parts of the Upper Palatinate as well as Kelheim on the Danube. This, the only genuine rising of the people in Bavarian history, was directed against a foreign rule, which oppressed the whole country, after the banishment of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. This genuine uprising reorganized itself as a defender of Bavaria with a large army and summoned the Braunau Parliament. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism this meeting was held, on 21 December 1705, in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten, where representatives met of the four estates: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants.

Fl√≤rio, Treccani Enciclopedie on line (retrieved 10 April 2018) An automobile enthusiast, he is best known as the founder of the Targa Florio. Early life He was the son of the Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Ignazio Florio Sr. and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. He was born in Palermo and was named after his grandfather Vincenzo Florio Sr. (1799‚Äì1886) who founded the Florio wine and spice company. He was the younger brother of Ignazio Florio Jr.. Not inclined to business, he loved traveling and was a frequent visitor of Paris, Nice, Montecarlo and Cannes. Luxury boats were one of his passions: in the family they owned five yachts. Florio, Vincenzo, by Simone Candela - Treccani Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 48 (1997) In 1909 he married principessa Annina Alliata di Montereale.

He had finished third in the 1904 edition, and generously funding the 1905 race, which was renamed Coppa Florio. He donated 50,000 lire and a Cup for the winner. His greatest fame came from creating the Targa Florio race in 1906, based on discussions with James Gordon Bennett Jr. and Henri Desgrange. The Targa also claimed to be a worldly event not to be missed. Renowned artists, such as Alexandre Charpentier and Leonardo Bistolfi, were commissioned to design medals. A magazine was initiated, Rapiditas, which aimed to enhance, with graphic and photographic reproductions of the race, the myth of the car and the typical character of modern life, speed. Florio also raced himself. His best result was the win in the Targa Rignano (Padova - Bovolenta) 1903, named after Count Rignano, thus inspiring Florio to pick the surname-based Targa Florio. His own racing team, however, got Felice Nazzaro to leave Fiat and join as driver, who had won the 1907 race.

This was based on the popular culture version, with individual Hokas taking roles reminiscent of the stereotypes found in fiction about the Legion. The Hoka Foreign Legion plays an important role, living up to its model's traditions, in the story \\"The Tiddlywink Warriors.\\" * Andrew Keith and William H. Keith, Jr.'s The Fifth Foreign Legion Trilogy chronicles the exploits of Legionnaires around the turn of the 30th century. These Legionnaires are members of the Fifth Foreign Legion which is a direct descendant of the French Foreign Legion. According to the chronology of the novels, the French Foreign Legion is considered the First Foreign Legion which was reorganized into the Second Foreign Legion after the First was destroyed, a process which occurred thrice more to make the present Foreign Legion in the novels the Fifth. The novels are rife with Legion traditions, terminology, and famous quotes. Although the Legion of the novels now serves the human Commonwealth as a whole (made up of Earth plus numerous colonized planets) rather than France alone, its composition and function are virtually identical to that of the French Foreign Legion of the past and present. The three novels are titled: March Or Die, Honor and Fidelity, and Cohort of the Damned. * In Terry Brooks' The Elfstones of Shannara, there is a unit of Callahorn's army that is quite similar to the French Foreign Legion, named the Free Corps. Anyone is allowed to sign up with them, no questions asked. * In Jerry Pournelle's Future History, involving a future soldier of fortune named John Christian Falkenberg, there is a central role to the CoDominium Armed Forces, which fights on all kinds of planets far away in space, and which had been created out of the French Foreign Legion and still keeps many of its traditions such as the aforementioned \\"Camerone Day\\". * Pournelle's fellow SF writer David Drake, the author of the Hammer's Slammers series, also bases his mercenary unit on the French Foreign Legion. More specifically, the Legion after the Second World War, when most of its members had fled from prosecution from the Allied War Crimes Commission. * Yet another SF depiction is Frank Herbert's Man of Two Worlds (1986). Part of the story takes place on Venus, with a war occurring on the planet between the French and their Foreign Legion and the Chinese. Foot soldiers on both sides wear armored suits made of inceram, an incredibly heat-resistant material, to protect them from the planet's surface temperatures. Any damage to a soldier's armor which allows the Venusian atmosphere inside results in his body literally boiling into vapor. * In British comic fantasy author Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, the \\"Klatchian Foreign Legion\\" parodies the French Foreign Legion (the region of Klatch itself being roughly analogous to the Middle East/North Africa). It is generally regarded as a \\"place men go to forget\\", and appears to be very effective in this, as evidenced by its members' frequent failure to recall its name, or in many cases, their own names. It is jokingly described as \\"Twenty years service and all the sand you can eat.\\" * Science Fiction author William C. Dietz has written a future history where the Legion is now the official armed forces of the \\"Confederacy\\", a multi-species political entity.

Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series is a military organization similar to the romantic view of the French Foreign Legion. Many of the members of The Watch are sons of nobles with little claim to their father's holdings or criminals that chose lifelong service with The Watch instead of suffering the typical punishment for their crime (usually execution). One of the tenets of the organization is that all men are equal once they \\"take the black\\", regardless if they were noble or commoner before joining. * Robert Asprin's Phule's Company novels revolve around a \\"Space Legion\\" that any being can join. They choose a new name and their crimes are erased. * Philip Gordon Wylie's Gladiator (1930) follows the adventures of Hugo Danner, an American man born with superhuman strength, speed, and bulletproof skin via prenatal chemical experimentation. He later joins the legion during World War I and uses his skills to combat the German Empire. * In the Code Geass manga, Nunnally's Nightmare, the Britannian Foreign Legion appears as main antagonists. * In Max Brooks's The Zombie Survival Guide French Foreign Legionnaires are mentioned in a recorded zombie siege at Ft. Louis Philippe in North Africa, 1893. Art In his oeuvre Danish artist Adam Saks has concerned himself extensively with the French Foreign Legion and its colonial history as well as with the individual's solitude and aggression. Pulp magazines Foreign Legion fiction was commonplace in American pulp magazines from the mid-20s through the late-30s.

The apparatus prevented pinched fingers, and was fitted out with a mechanism that moved the horses legs in \\"real life action.\\" Another Mattel feature allowed Blaze to talk when you pulled his \\"Magic Ring.\\" His talking voice unit was the very same one produced by Mattel and unveiled in 1960 in its talking Chatty Cathy doll, and later toys like the Talking Mister Ed puppet. Blaze could say 11 different things like, \\"How about some hay?\\"; he could also whinny and neigh. A toy like this, that could gallop and move realistically when the horse was rocked forward and backward, was something special. Blaze was made of what Mattel called \\"hi-impact plastic\\" with black-and-white markings (a pinto pony), and a molded black saddle and red blanket. Blaze also had attached reins, fixed hand-posts, and 2-position foot rests. The stand was made of 1-inch tubular steel and was advertised as being \\"untippable.\\" Saddle height was 29 inches and was recommended for ages 1‚Äì7. Blaze was marketed in most retail catalogs, such as Sears, J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Wards.

US 1 was designated through Florida when the United States Numbered Highway System was established in 1926. The road is maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). From its national southern terminus in Key West, US 1 carries the Overseas Highway‚Äì the Keys main highway ‚Äìnorth to the mainland, entering South Florida. From South Florida to Jacksonville, US 1 runs close to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, generally east of Interstate 95 (I-95) and west of State Road A1A (SR A1A), running roughly parallel with both roads. North of Jacksonville, US 1 curves inland towards the St. Mary's River as it enters Georgia. As is the case with all Florida roads with national designations, the entirety of US 1 has a hidden FDOT designation: * SR 5 from Whitehead Street / Fleming Street in Key West to Federal Highway (SR 5 north) in Lantana, Belvedere Road in West Palm Beach to the I-95/Kings Avenue (SR 5 north) interchange in Jacksonville, and the Main Street (SR 5 south) on/off-ramps south of the Main Street Bridge to US 1 Alternate/US 17 in Jacksonville. * SR 805 from Federal Highway in Lantana to Belvedere Road in West Palm Beach * SR 9 from the I-95/Kings Avenue interchange in Jacksonville to the Main Street exit heading toward the Main Street bridge via Interstate 95 Service Road. * SR 10 from the Atlantic Boulevard (US 90 east/SR 10 east) interchange to Beaver Street (US 90 west/SR 10 west) in downtown Jacksonville via Main Street. * SR 115 from US 1 Alt./US 17 in Jacksonville to the junction with I-95/SR 15 south/SR 115 north via the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. * SR 15 from the I-95 interchange in Jacksonville to the Georgia state line near Boulogne. Among other designations, US 1 is a designated Blue Star Memorial Highway along its entire route through the state. Markers are placed at various locations, including one in Rockledge and Fort Lauderdale. Route description=The Keys Mile zero in Key West US 1 officially begins its northward journey at the Monroe County courthouse at the intersection of Whitehead and Fleming Streets, Key West. It proceeds south as Whitehead Street, a two-laned street, until the intersection with Truman Avenue, which takes it east through central Key West. Truman Avenue becomes North Roosevelt Boulevard about a mile east, and remains so until leaving the island; US 1 expands to four lanes along its length. The road follows the northern shore of this section of Key West, then after curving southward, it meets State Road A1A head-on at a T-intersection before continuing east. This intersection also marks the southern terminus of the Overseas Highway, which US 1 is known by between here and mainland Florida. After crossing to Stock Island and forming the boundary between the eponymous district and incorporated Key West, US 1 proceeds through unincorporated Monroe County on Boca Chica Key, past the Naval Air Station Key West, and Rockland Key, where the Overseas Highway drops down to a two-laned road. It then crosses East Rockland Key, Big Coppitt Key (and its congruous district), Saddlebunch Keys, Sugarloaf Key, Park Key, Cudjoe Key (and its congruous district), Summerland Key, Ramrod Key, Middle Torch Key, Little Torch Key, Big Pine Key (and its congruous district), Scout Key, and Spanish Harbor Key. The highway expands to four lanes as it crosses the Bahia Honda Bridge, then reduces to two lanes as it traverses Bahia Honda Key, Ohio Key, Missouri Key, and Little Duck Key. After Little Duck Key, US 1 enters Knight's Key, Boot Key, Key Vaca and the town of Marathon via the Seven Mile Bridge, thus leaving the lower Keys. Overseas Highway and Railway Bridges, Florida Keys US 1 runs through Marathon as a four-laned road. After Key Vaca, the road becomes two-laned once more and runs through Fat Deer Key, where it forms the northern boundary of the city of Key Colony Beach. It then continues wholly in Marathon through Long Point Key, Crawl Key and Grassy Key. The road then crosses to Little Conch Key and then Conch Key, both part of the Duck Key district. US 1 then crosses to and traverses Long Key, which is mostly unincorporated except for the city of Layton, which the highway passes through. The road then reaches Craig Key, and then the village of Islamorada including Lower Matecumbe Key, Tea Table Key, Upper Matecumbe Key and Windley Key. US 1 crosses a drawbridge onto Plantation Key, where it expands to four lanes and then leaves Islamorada as it crosses to Key Largo. Immediately the Overseas Highway enters Tavernier, where it temporarily splits into a pair of one-way roads through the community. Soon the road enters the community of Key Largo, which also features another pair of one-way roads. At the northern end of the Key Largo district, about two-thirds of the way along the island, US 1 intersects County Road 905, which offers an alternative route out of the Keys via North Key Largo and the Card Sound Bridge. Signage approaching the intersection directs northbound motorists to take this alternative route if the lights on it are flashing. US 1 swings to the northwest, forms the southern boundary of North Key Largo, and becomes a two-laned divided road after the intersection. After crossing the Jewfish Creek Bridge (where it enters unincorporated Monroe County again) and travelling along Cross Key, US 1 crosses Manatee Creek, along with the Miami-Dade County boundary, and reaches the mainland. Miami-Dade County For the first in Miami-Dade County, US 1 is a divided two-lane road bordering the Everglades National Park on the west. It is named South Dixie Highway from the county line to Miami. Its first major intersection is with the north end of Card Sound Road south of Florida City. Similarly to the south, signage directs southbound travelers approaching this intersection to take Card Sound Road if the lights on it are flashing, rather than taking US 1 south to Key Largo. Portion of the South Dixie Highway, just south of Dadeland Just north of the Card Sound Road intersection, US 1 meets the southern end of Krome Avenue (State Road 997), and then enters Florida City. Here, US 1 intersects State Road 9336, providing access westwards to Everglades National Park; at the same intersection, Palm Drive (former State Road 906) likewise provides access eastwards to Biscayne National Park. From here northbound, the South Dixie Highway is paralleled by the South Miami-Dade Busway along the former Florida East Coast Railway alignment. Near-immediately northbound of the Palm Drive intersection, US 1 meets the southern end of the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, and then crosses into Homestead at South 328th Street. The road then curves northeast through Homestead, parallel to Florida's Turnpike, leaving the city north of South 304th Street, continuing northeast through the communities of Leisure City, Modello, Naranja, Princeton, and Goulds. At West 112th Avenue/Allapattah Road (SR 989), US 1 enters the incorporated town of Cutler Bay (formerly Cutler Ridge), soon passes under the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, and continues northeast in the town until at South 186th Street it forms the town's border for two blocks before leaving at South 184th Street. From here, the road continues northeast from this point, forming the western boundary of Palmetto Bay. In Perrine, it meets State Road 994, and then divides into a one-way pair of streets, with northbound traffic directed east one block of the southbound traffic along a sweeping curve between South 183rd and South 168th Streets. After the two directions of traffic rejoin, the road meets Coral Reef Drive (SR 992), then passes through Rockdale and Howard until it reaches South 136th Street (Howard Drive), meets the southern terminus of State Road 973 a block later, and serves to divide Pinecrest to the southeast and Kendall and Dadeland to the northwest for the next few miles. The road is also known as Pinecrest Parkway through this section. Also through this section, US 1 meets the eastern terminus of State Road 990, the southern terminus of the Palmetto Expressway (State Road 826), and the eastern terminus of State Road 94 at Kendall Drive. North of Snapper Creek (Canal C-2), US 1 continues northeast and enters another section of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Here, US 1 forms the Snapper Creek Expressway's (State Road 878)'s eastern terminus. The Dadeland South Metrorail station lies just south of the Expressway, on US 1's northern side, and acts as the handover point between the South Miami-Dade Busway and the Metrorail line, which proceeds to parallel US 1 for most of its subsequent journey into downtown Miami. The South Dixie Highway then crosses into South Miami at South 80th Street.South Miami city map At State Road 959 (Red Road/West 57th Avenue), US 1 leaves South Miami and enters Coral Gables, still headed northeast. At West 38th Avenue (Brooker Street), it leaves Coral Gables and enters Miami, heading northeast towards the southern terminus of Interstate 95 just south of downtown Miami. At this point, there is a signage gap in the route even though it is federally and state defined as cosigning with I-95 and SR 970 all the way to Biscayne Boulevard,SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON US ROUTE NUMBERING MEETING MINUTES FOR OCTOBER 17, 2013 where US 1 signage resumes. American Airlines Arena on Biscayne Boulevard; US 1 can be seen on the right side of the picture. In Miami, US 1 first intersects State Road 976, followed by the south end of State Road 9, which ends up running concurrent with Interstate 95, and is also I-95's state designation through most of Florida. About a mile east, it meets the national southern terminus of I-95, which it joins over the Miami River into downtown. Biscayne Boulevard in Downtown Miami The road is then named Biscayne Boulevard through the rest of Miami-Dade County as it proceeds north on Biscayne Bay. As Biscayne Boulevard, US 1 becomes a one-way pair at an intersection with State Road 970. Two blocks north, it reaches State Road 968 (Flagler Street), the north‚Äìsouth baseline for most of Miami-Dade County.

For the next few blocks, it passes by Bicentennial Park, with Interstate 395 at the northern end, which also marks the national southern terminus of US 41. US 1 continues through midtown Miami, intersecting with the national southern terminus of U.S. Route 27 one block south of Interstate 195 next to the Julia Tuttle Causeway. North of I-195, the road continues through Miami as a residential road, intersecting State Road 944, State Road 934, and State Road 915 before leaving Miami. Moving further inland, the Boulevard replaces East Sixth Avenue at 61st Street. It enters the village of Miami Shores at North 87th Street. Crossing the Biscayne Canal, Miami Shores becomes North Miami. In North Miami, it intersects State Road 922, leading to the Broad Causeway and State Road 916. In North Miami Beach, it intersects State Road 826, and State Road 860. The road enters Aventura at Greynolds Park.

Heading north towards Georgia, it passes by a welcome center on the southbound side in Boulogne, followed by an intersection with CR 121/Lake Hampton Road, the last intersection before US 1 crosses the St. Marys River and the Georgia state line. History US 1 was designated nationwide on November 11, 1926, running from Miami, Florida, north to Fort Kent, Maine. The label was generally applied to the Atlantic Highway, except between Jacksonville, Florida, and Augusta, Georgia, where a more inland route was chosen. In Florida, US 1 was designated along the full length of SR 4\\\\. South of Jacksonville, this was both the Atlantic Highway and the eastern division of the Dixie Highway; the route from Jacksonville northwest into Georgia was a Jacksonville‚ÄìMacon, Georgia Dixie Highway connector. The beginning of US 1 as of March 1951 With the Overseas Highway completed in 1938, US 1 was extended from Miami over the Overseas Highway (SR 4A) to Key West shortly afterward, where it still ends today. The section of US 1 between Miami and Jacksonville has been replaced by I-95 for most through traffic. In Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway, the \\"shield\\" for US 1 was red. Florida began using the colored shields in 1956, but during the 1980s the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices was revised to specify only a black and white color scheme for U.S. Highway shields.

The buildings seen here are the lower part of the mine complex which spreads up the hillside. Glenridding across Ullswater, with one of the steamers leaving the pier Glenridding is a village at the southern end of Ullswater, in the English Lake District. The village is popular with mountain walkers who can scale England's third-highest mountain, Helvellyn, and many other challenging peaks from there. Etymology The name Glenridding is generally agreed to be Cumbric in origin, with the first element being *glinn, 'valley', and the second being *red√Øn, 'ferns, bracken' (cf. Welsh glyn rhedyn), giving a meaning of 'valley overgrown with bracken'. First recorded as Glenredyn in around 1290, the name's present form is thought to have been influenced by the Middle English element ridding, 'clearing'. Geography Glenridding is in the civil parish of Patterdale. On 6 December 2015, Storm Desmond caused extensive and devastating flooding to the village, with torrential rainfall and rivers bursting their banks. Four days later, more rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks once again, leading to even more flood damage to businesses and homes in the village. Following the floods the community set up a Flood Action Group who continue to work on recovery and resilience measures to reduce the risk of future flooding. Community and culture Each year, on Easter Monday, a duck race is organised by the local mountain rescue team to raise funds. The village also has a rich sporting history, particularly in the traditional Lakeland sport of Fell Running and each September the Helvellyn Triathlon is held at Jenkins' Field by the shores of Ullswater, at one time considered the toughest triathlon in the UK. Amenities The village has accommodation including two youth hostels and camping sites. Glenridding House provides luxury bed and breakfast accommodation. There is also a tourist information centre, Ullswater Information Centre. Greenside Mine Above the village is the site of the former Greenside Mine, once the largest lead mine in the Lake District. Lead ore was discovered in the 18th century and the site was mined from the second half of the 18th century until the mine closed in 1962. Without the mine, the houses and economy of Glenridding and the surrounding area would not have existed.* Ullswater Steamers Glenridding is home to the Ullswater 'Steamers', a leisure boat trip company which operates five vessels from the pier at Glenridding. The company was founded to provide a transport link for goods from Glenridding to Pooley Bridge and onwards to Penrith. Glenridding in popular culture The village and surrounding area was used to film the TV drama series The Lakes, and has also featured in a scene in Coronation Street.

Williams. Goldberg was the only African American actress to be nominated for an Academy Award more than once, and the first African American actress to win one since Hattie McDaniel. Dr. Mae Jemison was the first black woman in space. The absence of Houston was not a surprise to many, because of her drug battle around that time. Hill was both the first woman to receive 10 Grammy nominations in one year and first to win 5 in one night. Williams was the first African American Miss America. Of the women listed here, notably Franklin is included in the \\"Legends\\" section of the book We Speak Your Names, written by Pearl Cleage to mark the event, including the titular poem that was recited twice during Legends weekend. Possible reasons for these absences: * Both Whoopi Goldberg and Aretha Franklin had well- documented fears of flying. Franklin was on tour at the time of the Legends Ball and it may have been logistically impossible for her to travel to California by bus or car and still honor her touring commitments. Additionally, Goldberg and Winfrey had a decades-spanning \\"disconnect,\\" which could have been a reason Goldberg either wasn't invited or declined to attend.http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahshow/oprah-and-whoopi-goldbergs- misunderstanding-video * Beyonc√© was on tour with Destiny's Child with shows in Dubai and Oslo during the weekend of the Legend's Ball.

In 1902 Jonckheere build his first \\"luxury automobile\\". In those days many, largely wooden bodies with their typical styling, were built upon several famous chassis such as Minerva and Rolls-Royce. In 1922 Henri's son and successor Joseph Jonckheere built his first bus body. Car bodies were still a large part of the production until the early 1930s when Jonckheere moved all of the production to bus and coach building, making Jonckheere the Belgian market leader. Jonckheere was also becoming a famous and well-known name throughout Europe. After World War II, there was a huge need for vehicles for road transport, which included of course a lot of buses and coaches. Jonckheere was able to quickly meet all new market trends. The product range also included luxury touring coaches, city and intercity buses, articulated buses but also heavy duty buses for worldwide export and several special bodies. In the 1970s, Jonckheere launched the Bermuda range that started to appear in the United Kingdom in 1977 and stayed in production until 1982. Jonckheere celebrated its first century in 1981 with a touring coach with the appropriate name of Jubilee. The range included a low floor P35 model, regular P50/P599 model, P799 with underfloor cockpit, P90 semi-decker with rear lounge, the P95 with an underfloor drivers cab and a rear lounge and P99 double decker. In 1989, Jonckheere launched the Deauville range and in 1994 came the Monaco double deck model. In 1996, the Mistral touring coach model was launched (in two heights Mistral 50 and 70). The Mistral remained in production until 2007 when it was replaced by the SH series. In 1994 Jonckheere became a part of the Berkhof Group which was subsequently acquired by VDL Groep in 1998. The official name of Jonckheere was then changed to VDL Jonckheere. A new high-specification coach was launched in Europe. The SH-series was initially available on the rear-engined Volvo B12B chassis. The demonstration model was built to a height of 3.8m. The body was also built on the Volvo B12M and Volvo B9R. Longer 14 metre versions were added to the range on the Volvo B12BT and B13R chassies. In 2010 VDL Jonckheere was subsumed by VDL Bus & Coach.

He became geological surveyor in charge in New South Wales in 1875 and was president of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1887. Early life Wilkinson was born at Pottersbury, Northamptonshire, England, the fourth son of David Wilkinson, C.E., who was associated with George Stephenson in the production of early locomotives. The family moved to Melbourne, Victoria in 1852, and the young Wilkinson was educated at a private school conducted by the Rev. T. P. Fenner. Career In December 1859 Wilkinson was given a position in the Geological Survey of Victoria under Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn. In 1861 he became a field assistant to Richard Daintree with whom he was associated in the survey of part of southern Victoria. In 1863 he was sent to explore the Cape Otway (Victoria) region and in 1866 succeeded Daintree when the latter left for Queensland. In 1868 Wilkinson's health broke down; he resigned from the survey, and spent the next four years at Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. He passed the examination for licensed surveyor in 1872, and was sent by the surveyor-general of New South Wales to the new tin- mining district in New England, New South Wales, on which he reported, and in 1874 he was appointed geological surveyor. In 1875 Wilkinson was transferred to the mines department with the title of geological surveyor in charge. The systematic geological survey of New South Wales was begun under his direction, and valuable work was done. He urged Joseph Edmund Carne to study geology, subsequently in 1879, Carne joined the survey as assistant to Wilkinson. In 1876 Wilkinson was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London and in 1881 a fellow of the Linnean Society. In 1882 Edgeworth David was appointed assistant geological surveyor, Wilkinson delegated much responsibility to him. Late life and legacy In 1883 and 1884 Wilkinson was president of the Linnean Society of New South Wales and in 1887 president of the Royal Society of New South Wales. He died after a short illness on 26 August 1891. He was survived by his wife and two sons (including a daughter born shortly after his death). His Notes on the Geology of New South Wales was published by the mines department in 1882, and about 80 of his reports and papers are listed in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales for 1892, p. 9\\\\. Wilkinson was respected by his colleagues, who did good work in connexion with the mining industry, and was the first to suggest to the government the possibility of finding subterranean water in western New South Wales. The first bore was put down under his direction. The fine collection of minerals in the Sydney geological survey museum was founded and largely brought together by him.

Craig y Llyn (translates from Welsh as 'rock/cliff of the lake') is a mountain situated to the south of the village of Rhigos on the south side of the upper Vale of Neath and north of the Rhondda Valleys in South Wales; it is the highest point in the traditional county of Glamorgan, and the South Wales Valleys. Description The summit of Craig y Llyn lies within the borough of Neath Port Talbot whilst its eastern slopes are within Rhondda Cynon Taf, the boundary running in a north - south direction 200 m to the east of the summit. The name derives from the sandstone cliffs which drop steeply down to the two lakes on its northern side. Ground on this side (but not the summit) has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The hill is covered by forestry, except for the steep north and northeast faces, and is crowned with a trig point. Several footpaths cross near the summit of the hill, including the Coed Morgannwg Way. The highest point in Neath Port Talbot, Craig y Llyn, is commonly known as the Rhigos Mountain after the village of Rhigos located on the northern side of the mountain in the Cynon Valley. The Countryside Council for Wales states that the site has been categorised as a Site of Special Interest because it supports \\"...two special habitat features, and is also of special interest for a plant, the water lobelia. The first habitat feature is standing water, supporting aquatic plants typical of lakes with low nutrient content. Some of these plants are not known from anywhere further south in the UK. The second is dry heath, found on the slopes above the lakes. Panoramic view of Rhigos and Llyn Fawr from Craig y Llyn Geology The hill is composed of a thick sequence of sandstones and mudstones assigned to the South Wales Coal Measures. The summit plateau is formed from the Pennant Sandstone of the Upper Coal Measures. The two cwms on its northern flanks which shelter Llyn Fach and Llyn Fawr are of glacial origin. In fact, the two lakes are the southernmost glacial tarns to occupy cwms in Great Britain. A landslipped mass of rock lies above the western end of the latter lake.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' See also *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Mid & South Glamorgan ReferencesExternal links *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Craig y Llyn and surrounding area Marilyns of Wales Mountains and hills of Rhondda Cynon Taf Highest points of Welsh counties Hardys of Wales Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Rhondda Cynon Taf ","title":"Craig y Llyn"},{"id":"6310469","text":"Witzleben is a municipality in the district Ilm-Kreis in Thuringia, Germany.

Greek War of Independence During the Greek War of Independence, three constitutional texts (Constitutions of 1822, 1823 and 1827) were adopted by the Greek National Assemblies, the national representative political gatherings of the Greek revolutionaries. These constitutions were influenced by: *the French Constitutions of 1793 and 1795, *the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, *the Draft Constitution of Rigas Velestinlis,Consisting of two main parts: 35 articles concerning the Human Rights and 124 articles concerning the legislative, judicial and executive powers. See the full text of the Draft Constitution in *the three Constitutions of the Ionian Islands.See A year before the adoption of the Greek Constitution of 1822, local Assemblies had ratified the so-called Greek local statutes, such as the Senate Organization of Western Greece, the Legal Order of Eastern Greece and the Peloponnesian Senate Organization. From the absolute to the constitutional monarchy (1833‚Äì1924) In the name of the Holy, Consubstantial and Indivisible Trinity...are the first words of the Greek Constitution of 1844. King Otto governed for more than 10 years without any constitutional restrictions, since the \\"hegemonical\\" Greek Constitution of 1832 was never implemented. On 3 September 1843, the infantry, led by Colonel Dimitrios Kallergis and the Revolutionary captain Ioannis Makriyannis, assembled in the square in front of the palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the king agreed to grant a constitution. Left with little recourse, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated Queen. This square was renamed to Constitution Square (Syntagma Square) to commemorate the events of September 1843. The Greek Constitution of 1844 defined Greece as a constitutional monarchy,See providing for a bicameral parliament, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The Greek Constitution of 1864 was somewhat more liberal, and transferred most of the real power to the parliament. In 1874 Charilaos Trikoupis published a manifesto entitled \\"Who's to blame?\\", naming King George I as the answer. Specifically, he condemned the king for bypassing parliamentary opinion in his selection of Prime Ministers. The article landed him briefly in jail, but also boosted his popularity significantly. A year later, on 8 May 1874 he mustered a parliamentary plurality and George reluctantly named him as Prime Minister. Thanks to Trikoupis' article, a new constitutional principle was recognized and implemented: the king was required to give the largest party in parliament first choice of forming a government. In 1911 Eleftherios Venizelos amended 54 of the 110 articles of the Constitution, trying to bring the constitution in line with his Liberal Party's principles. Nevertheless, the National schism of 1916 caused a huge constitutional crisis, as two governments were formed: one in Athens and one in Thessaloniki. The Second Hellenic Republic and the Restoration (1925‚Äì1941) Front page of the 1927 Constitution The Constitution of 1925 provided for a Republic in accordance with the results of the plebiscite of 1924. Nonetheless, on 24 June 1925, officers loyal to Theodoros Pangalos, fearing that the political instability was putting the country at risk, overthrew the government in a coup and violated the Constitution. On 24 August 1926, a counter-coup deposed him and Pavlos Kountouriotis returned as president. Since the previous Constitution was not fully implemented, it was the Constitution of 1927 which formally established the Second Hellenic Republic and provided for a largely ceremonial president as head of state.See After the plebiscite of 1935, King George II was restored, but the Third Revisionary Parliament of 1936 did not have the time to replace or amend the Constitution of the Republic. Instead, the Constitution of 1911 was restored, ostensibly on a temporary basis. The elections of 1936 had produced a political deadlock and, thereby, George II appointed Ioannis Metaxas to be interim prime minister. Widespread industrial unrest in May allowed Metaxas to declare a state of emergency. On 4 August, he suspended the parliament indefinitely and suspended various articles of the constitution, with the king's approval. For all intents and purposes, Metaxas was now a dictator. No constitutional amendment was adopted before Germany invaded Greece in 1941. The Kingdom of Greece after the Second World War (1942‚Äì1967) After the end of the Second World War, King George II was once again restored by virtue of the plebiscite of 1946. The implications of the Greek Civil War did not allow the ratification of the liberal Draft Constitution of 1948. A more conservative Constitution was passed in 1952, which imposed restrictions on basic human rights and banned the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). The Colonels' Regime (1967‚Äì1974) On 21 April 1967, a coup took place by right- wing officers, which established a dictatorship known as the Colonels' Regime. An attempted counter-coup by King Constantine II in December failed, forcing him to leave the country. Thus, legally, there was no government and no Head of State in Athens. Thereby, the Revolutionary Council of Stylianos Pattakos, George Papadopoulos and Nikolaos Makarezos made a brief appearance to cause a Resolution to be published in the Government Gazette, appointing another member to the military administration, Major General Georgios Zoitakis, as Regent. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as Prime Minister. A new constitution was adopted by referendum in 1968. King Constantine was officially retained as head of state, though he would not be allowed to return until the first parliamentary election unless the government recalled him sooner. Many of the guarantees of civil rights were suspended, and elections were postponed until the \\"Revolution of April 21\\" (as the coup was called) had reformed the \\"Greek mentality.\\" Five years later, during Papadopoulos' attempts at controlled democratization, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. A plebiscite formally abolished the monarchy on 29 July 1973. A new Constitution was drafted, providing for a popularly elected president with wide-ranging powers, effectively establishing a presidential republic. After the hard-liners' coup on 25 November 1973 deposed Papadopoulos, the regime retained the trappings of the Republic, but reverted to exclusively military control until its final collapse in the wake of the Cyprus crisis in August 1974. The Third Hellenic Republic With the return of civilian rule under Constantine Karamanlis, the new government, acting under extraordinary circumstances, issued a \\"Constituting Act\\" which voided the 1973 constitution. Pending a referendum on a new constitution, the 1952 constitution was temporarily restored, \\"except for the articles dealing with the form of the State\\"; the last phrase referring to whether the monarchy would be restored or not. In the meantime, the functions of the king were to be discharged by the president of the republic. The matter was settled by plebiscite on 8 December 1974, by which the monarchy was definitively abolished. A new Constitution, adopted by Parliament and promulgated on 11 June 1975, established a parliamentary democracy with a president as head of state. In practice, however, most of the power was vested in the prime minister. This constitution was revised in 1985 to codify this practice. It was amended again in 2001, in 2008 and in 2019 and is in force today.

History They started cmc. they were originally a pious association of ladies formed in 1626 for the care of thein the service of the sick. The members placed themselves under the patronage of St. Charles Borromeo, called the \\"Apostle of Charity\\", and adopted the constitutions drawn up by Dom Epiphane Louys, Abbot of Estivals and Vicar General of the reformed Premonstratensians. By the middle of the 18th century the congregation was in charge of numerous hospitals, and shortly afterwards took up as an additional task the Christian education of children. During the French Revolutionary period the members, although dispersed and deprived of their religious habit, continued their work so heroically as to win the encomiums of their persecutors. On 22 July 1804, they resumed their wearing of the habit, having obtained the approval of Napoleon, and were soon in a flourishing condition. Organisation and branching Their rule, based on the rule of St. Augustine, received papal approbation in 1859, and additional constitutions were confirmed by Leo XIII in 1892. Their work includes the direction of all manner of charitable institutions, such as domestic and trade schools, homes for first communicants, protectories, poor- houses, homes for defectives and female reformatories, as well as the care of the sick in their homes. They also have charge of schools, including a number of normal institutes in Austria. Candidates must spend one year as postulants and from three to four and a half years as novices before being admitted to the congregation. The auxiliary sisters for the care of the sick renew their vows annually. There are several entirely independent branches of Borromean Sisters. In 1838 one was established by Aloysius Joseph Freiherr von Schrenk, Prince-Bishop of Prague (died 1849), which was confirmed as a separate congregation in 1841, and in the early 20th century had 900 members in 102 houses, chiefly in Bohemia, Moravia, Upper Austria and Lower Austria. In 1848 Melchior Freiherr von Diepenbrock, Prince-Bishop of Breslau, invited the Prague Borromeans to found a house at Neisse, which, in 1857, was raised to the rank of the mother-house of a separate congregation. Later the mother- house was transferred to Trebnitz, and temporarily, during the Kulturkampf, to Teschen, where a provincial house for imperial Austria was later established (1889). A house of this congregation founded at Alexandria in 1884 was, in 1894, made a provincial mother-house and a novitiate for the (Ottoman) Orient, with the direction of schools, an asylum for the aged, and a hospice for German pilgrims. Affiliated foundations have been made at Jerusalem (1886), Haifa (1888), Cairo (1904) and Emmaus. The members of the Trebnitz congregation numbered 1900, in 211 houses c. 1910. In 1811 a foundation was made from Nancy at Trier whence the congregation spread to other cities of western Germany. In 1849 a provincial house was erected at Trier which by decree of Pius IX (18 September 1872), was made the mother-house of an independent congregation. A famous Borromean institution is St. Hedwig's Hospital at Berlin, founded in 1846 by Angelika Eschweiler. The Trier branch comprises over 1200 sisters in 70 houses. A foundation was also made at Maastricht (Dutch province of Limburg) in 1837 by Peter Anton van Baer.

Participants from all over Europe and the world stay at the And√∏ya Space Center in Northern Norway for one week, learning from professionals and becoming amateur rocket scientists. Ultimately the goal of the camp is to launch a student sounding rocket, capable of carrying several sensors and reaching a height of 10 000m and Mach 3. Participants are divided into groups ordered with respect to their interests and work together as a team for the week-long project of launching a student rocket. Through the European Space Camp experience the young people are motivated to redirect their studies or renew their interest in the direction of science and technology. The scientific part of the camp is divided between lectures and group work. Some of the best lecturers from across Europe lecture on topics as diverse as Rocket Physics, the work of CERN and the Northern Lights. Group work enables participants to spend a week in the life of a scientist and tackle a problem relating to the rocket launch at the end of the week. There are six groups in total: Rocket System Design, Experimental Instrumentation, Payload, Rocket Telemetry, Rocket Physics and GPS. The highlight of the week is the rocket launch, which takes place near the end of the week, with just enough time to analyse the results of the launch. An important part of Space Camp is getting to know the other participants. As a result, a number of social activities are organised throughout the camp.http://www.spacecamp.no History European Space Camp at And√∏ya Rocket Range was arranged for the first time in the summer of 1996. It was the Norwegian Association of Young Scientists that initiated the idea of a summer camp with this specific subject. Today the camp is made possible by the joint efforts of And√∏ya Space Center AS and the National Centre of Space-Related Education (NAROM), in cooperation with the Norwegian Space Centre and the European Space Agency (ESA). The first Space Camp And√∏ya in 1996 was such a success that the concept was developed further each year. In 2001 Space Camp became a European event which in 2002 hosted participants from 10 different countries. European Space Camp is special with regard to subjects dealt with, the participants' real involvement in the work and what they learn during the camp. The youths at Space Camp work in groups on specific tasks which are all related to the rocket launch at the end of the camp. The students are treated as real scientists and work on advanced problems using professional equipment. The professors and scientists being around are valuable resources and helpers, leaving all the actual scientific work to the participants.http://www.spacecamp.no  Organizers and Partners =Team Space Camp *Gaute Holen (Head) *Nina Marie Thomsen (Vice Head) *Tiia Tikkala *Inge Eide Johnsen *Anne Nijdam Svindland *Anders M√∏rk National Centre of Space-Related Education (NAROM) represented by *Arne-Hjalmar Hansen *Hege-Merethe Str√∏mdal *Anita Hanssen Notable guests *Alv Egeland has been a lecturer since the first camp in 1996. *Egil Lillest√∏l has been a lecturer since 2001. *Christer Fuglesang was a guest lecturer in 2016 for the 20th anniversary. *Andrei Borisenko was a guest lecturer 2017. *Charles Simonyi visited the camp in 2015.

At the Major Case Unit, Lester Freamon, Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski and new member Caroline Massey man a wiretap. Sydnor observes that Cheese does not use a phone, instead conducting his business face-to-face and receiving phone messages through his subordinate. After being relieved by Freamon and Kima Greggs, McNulty is told by ASA Rhonda Pearlman and Lieutenant Cedric Daniels that they are considering the abandonment of the wire. McNulty, believing the wire will eventually reach Proposition Joe and Stringer Bell, heatedly asserts that Bell is their target and that all other objectives are secondary. Daniels insists they need a break in the case to justify continued use of the wiretaps. McNulty, Greggs and Freamon observe a dealer named Drac, who is far less discreet on the phone than Cheese's crew. Freamon states that Drac is supplied by Lavelle Mann, one of Joe's soldiers; Sydnor has been developing a connection with Mann through undercover work for some time. They plan to arrest Mann in the hope that Drac, Joe's nephew, will be promoted and give them more information on the organization through his careless talk on the wire. Daniels takes the plan to Acting Commissioner Ervin Burrell, who is reluctant to fund more wiretaps. Burrell later reports to Daniels that Mayor Clarence Royce is now holding up the proposal to promote Daniels to the position of Major because Daniels' wife Marla is set to challenge one of the mayor's allies in an upcoming election. Burrell tells Daniels that the mayor will not make him a commander until he knows where Marla stands politically. McNulty goes to an Orioles game with his old partner Bunk Moreland. He meets his estranged wife Elena to take his children for the second half. Despite it being his day off, Bunk is forced to leave the game early when he is called to work a murder scene. The following day, Daniels marshals his men for the hand-to-hand on Mann. Once out in the field, Greggs and McNulty make a clean arrest and Sydnor maintains his cover. Drac immediately starts talking about a possible promotion on the wire. Unfortunately for the detail, the promotion goes to Cheese instead. After McNulty and Daniels argue over the future of the case, Freamon chastises McNulty for his confrontational attitude and self-absorption. At midnight, Prez finds McNulty reviewing old files from the Barksdale investigation. As Massey leaves, McNulty explains his research to her as a way to avoid making the same mistakes again. In the Western District, Sergeant Ellis Carver marshals his new squad and plans a sting on a corner drug dealing operation. He and Thomas \\"Herc\\" Hauk eventually chase down a runner named Tyrell. Elsewhere, Major Howard \\"Bunny\\" Colvin greets two new officers to his district, Aaron Castor and Brian Baker. When Carver and Herc bring Tyrell in with no evidence for a drug charge, Colvin criticizes their use of resources. Later, as he prepares to patrol the Western, he is disappointed to see that Carver's squad has brought in more street dealers on loitering charges with no leads into their distributors. Colvin further sees the urban decay blighting the neighborhood thanks to rampant crime. He is even more disgusted when a young drug dealer, Justin, approaches him despite his being in uniform. Bodie Broadus, Poot Carr and Puddin reminisce about the Barksdale towers, which are being demolished. Bell chairs a meeting to discuss the Barksdales' new direction now that their main territory is lost; Bodie suggests that they take new territory by force. Bell instead suggests that they supply other dealers with their product rather than battle over territory, urging his subordinates to think like businessmen. Meanwhile, in prison, Wee-Bey Brice talks to former Barksdale soldier Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise, who is about to be paroled. Avon Barksdale asks Cutty for help securing new territory and gives him a number to call when he is released. Once outside, Cutty arranges a meeting with Shamrock and is given directions to a package of narcotics. Cutty observes one of Marlo Stanfield's crews and strikes a deal with the leader, Fruit, to work the package for a share of the profit. When Cutty returns later that night, Fruit tells him his stash was confiscated by police and drives him away with a gun. Bubbles and Johnny lose control of their cart, which crashes into the car of Marlo's driver. He takes their trousers as punishment. After buying new pants, they are unable to afford drugs for the both of them. Elsewhere, Royce delivers a speech at the demolition ceremony for the towers. Councilmen Tommy Carcetti grills Burrell and Deputy Commissioner William Rawls about increased violent crime in East Baltimore during a review meeting. Over lunch, Burrell declines an offer by Carcetti to help him if Royce shorts him on funding. He meets with Royce and his chief of staff, Coleman Parker, who speculates Carcetti is preparing to run for mayor. Royce dismisses Carcetti's chances of winning in a majority-black city, but Parker is concerned he could use rising crime figures to his advantage. Royce and Parker pressure Burrell to have the Baltimore Police reduce violent crime citywide by 5% in each district and keep murders under 275 for the year. At the next ComStat meeting, Burrell tells his men to cut the felony rate by Royce's figures. Colonel Raymond Foerster, now in charge of the CID, is dismayed at the directive. Colvin realizes how the commanders have been encouraged to water down their figures and questions how they could \\"juke the stats\\" with murder victims. Burrell threatens to replace commanders who fail to deliver the figures he wants. Later, Daniels attends a meeting at his home with State Delegate Odell Watkins and Marla's other political contacts. Once they have left, Marla thanks him and he returns to sleep at the office.

Oppari is a folk song tradition and is often an admixture of eulogy and lament. The oppari is typically sung by a group of women relatives who came to pay respects to the departed in a death ceremony. It in a means to express one's own grief and also to share and assuage the grief of the near and dear of the diseased. Many communities use the oppari to express their grief at a funeral. Sometimes professional oppari singers are recruited, but it is a dying practice. Content and theme The songs do not follow a set pattern; rather, the lyrics are sung impromptu, mostly improvised, and eulogise the person who has died. The oppari is also often centred around the relatives of the diseased and stresses the nature of the blood relation (mother, father, brother, sister etc) between the person and the diseased. The oppari singers sings, wails and beats her chest and accompanied to the sounds of a beating drum she helps mourners bring their buried grief to the surface. A sample theme of a daughter lamenting father's death is described below: Opparis are rich in wordplay relating to names and events associated with the deceased person. Colourful local idioms also decorate the lyrics. While oppari singing is still prominent in rural Tamil Nadu, the tradition had almost died out in urban Tamil Nadu.

Raised in Victoria as part of the First Australian Imperial Force for service during World War I, the battalion formed part of the 2nd Brigade, attached to the 1st Division. It participated in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, coming ashore in the second wave, before taking part in the fighting at Krithia and then at Lone Pine. In December 1915 the battalion was withdrawn from the peninsula and returned to Egypt where it was involved in defending the Suez Canal until being transferred to the Western Front in France in early 1916. After that, over the course of the next two and a half years the 5th Battalion was rotated in and out of the front line and took part in a number of significant battles including at Pozieres, Ypres, Amiens and the Hindenburg Line. Following the end of the war, the battalion was disbanded and its personnel returned to Australia. The battalion was re-raised during the inter- war years as a part-time unit and was later mobilised during World War II, but did not serve overseas. During the post war period, the battalion has existed at various times before being subsumed into the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History=World War I Following the outbreak of World War I, Australia began raising an all volunteer force for overseas service almost immediately. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 which precluded sending conscripts overseas to fight, it was decided not to send the militia units that were already in existence, but instead to raise new battalions as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).Grey 2008, p. 85. Many of the previously existing militia units chose to enlist together in the AIF and in order to maintain a degree of esprit de corps these men were often allocated to the same AIF unit. As a result, many AIF units retained the identity and traditions of their parent militia units. Many of the 5th Battalion's members had previously served with the Victorian Scottish Regiment‚Äîa Melbourne-based militia unit‚Äîincluding the battalion's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel David Stanley Wanliss, who would later go on to become the Chief Justice of New Guinea after the war. A trench held by the 5th Battalion around \\"MacLaurin's Hill\\" on the Gallipoli Peninsula Such was the enthusiasm with which Australians volunteered at the start of the war, that the battalion was raised within two weeks. After a period of just two months basic training, they left Australia and proceeded to Egypt, arriving on 2 December 1914. A further period of training took place, before the battalion was committed to the Gallipoli Campaign. It took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, as part of the second wave. Ten days after the landing the 2nd Brigade was transferred from Anzac Cove to Cape Helles to assist in the attack on Krithia. In August, the battalion took part in the Battle of Lone Pine. The battalion continued to serve at Gallipoli until the evacuation in December when the battalion returned to Egypt. During this time the AIF underwent an expansion from two infantry divisions, to five and many members of the 5th Battalion were used to raise the 57th Battalion. In March 1916, the battalion sailed to France and deployed to the Somme, seeing action at Pozi√®res in July 1916, followed by Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter. Throughout 1917 the 5th Battalion was involved in operations against the Hindenburg Line, before being involved in the Battle of Passchendaele between June and November 1917. In 1918, the battalion helped to stop the German spring offensive in March and April. The battalion subsequently participated in the greatest Allied offensive of 1918, launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, when the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the front line for a period of rest and training. Consequently, when the armistice came into effect on 11 November 1918, the battalion was out of the line. During the war, a total of 970 members of the battalion were killed, while a further 2,013 were wounded. Members of the battalion received the following awards: two Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, five Distinguished Service Orders, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, 23 Military Crosses and one Bar, 24 Distinguished Conduct Medals with one Bar, 202 Military Medals with six Bars and one second bar, six Meritorious Service Medals and 47 Mentions in Despatches. Soon after the fighting ended the long process of demobilisation and repatriation began and men from the battalion began marching out to begin the journey back to Australia. Slowly the 5th Battalion's numbers dwindled and by April 1919, it was amalgamated with the 8th Battalion. This battalion was then later amalgamated with another, formed from the 6th and 7th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion. Inter- war years and subsequent service The demobilisation process was finally completed by early 1920 and in April 1921 the AIF was officially disbanded.Grey 2008, p. 125. After this it was decided to preserve the honours of the AIF units by bestowing their battle honours and unit designations upon the militia units with which they had been affiliated. As a result of this, the Victorian Scottish Regiment was redesignated the 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment) and was entrusted with the 5th Battalion's battle honours, as the battalion was re-raised from elements of the 5th, 46th and 60th Infantry Regiments and the 29th Light Horse Regiment within Victoria.Festberg 1972, p. 62. During World War II, the battalion remained in Australia undertaking garrison duties. As a Militia unit, it was precluded under the terms of the Defence Act from serving overseas, but in 1943 it was gazetted as an \\"AIF\\" battalion after the majority of its personnel volunteered for overseas service. Nevertheless, it was disbanded on 16 October 1944 as surplus to Army requirements. Following the war, Australia's part-time military force was re-formed in 1948 under the guise of the Citizens Military Force,Grey 2008, pp. 200‚Äì201. and the battalion was re-raised at this time. Later, in 1960, this regiment was absorbed into the Royal Victoria Regiment, forming 'A' Company within the Pentropic 1st Battalion, and its colours laid up in Scots' Church, Melbourne. When the Pentropic system was discontinued in July 1965, the 5th was re-formed as a full battalion, known as 5 RVR. In the late 1980s, it was merged into the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment.Shaw 2010, pp. 10‚Äì11.

Composed of three siblings: two brothers and a sister, their musical style is influenced by traditional Navajo Din√© music and alternative rock, with political messages about government oppression and human rights. In 2012, members formed the band Sihasin.  History = Beginnings (1989‚Äì1993)  Blackfire was founded in 1989 by Jeneda, Klee, and Clayson Benally, three siblings born in the heart of the land struggle at Black Mesa on the Navajo Nation. Their mother was a folk singer, and their father, Jones Benally, was a traditional medicine man who raised them on traditional Native songs. Not surprisingly, their children followed suit and have been playing music since \\"their instruments were bigger than they were.\\" To this very day, Jones and his children perform as the Jones Benally Family, either as a part of or separately from Blackfire performances, which are always at all-ages venues, to display their \\"traditional form of dance, song and story that has been carried on from the beginning of time...including histories of ceremonys [sic], hunting, agriculture and the foundation of the Din√© Culture.\\"  Release of EPs (1994‚Äì2001)  Though they began performing in 1989, Blackfire did not record any of their music until their uniquely substantial and energetic music got the attention of punk rock godfathers The Ramones. In 1994, C.J. Ramone produced a 5-song EP that became their debut album released on their label Tacoho Productions. It also included musical contributions by their father Jones and by renowned American Indian flutist Robert Tree Cody. Four years later, they released another EP, this time producing it on their own and only releasing three new songs instead of five. In 1999, they received a NAMA nomination for Best Independent Release. Two years after that accomplishment, they embarked on a European tour, gaining more support along the way.  One Nation Under and Woodie Guthrie Singles (2002‚Äì2003)  By the end of 2002, they released their first LP One Nation Under. Produced by Don Fleming, producer for Sonic Youth and Joan Jett, and once again featuring their father doing traditional vocals, the album is described as \\"15 passionately burning songs of struggles, resistance, and hope.\\" The song \\"No Control\\" was used in the \\"New Mexico, Old Monster\\" episode of What's New, Scooby-Doo?. It is also the last project that Joey Ramone, who dubbed Blackfire's music as \\"fireball punk-rock,\\" contributed to before he died due to lymphoma. On the album, he provided additional voicing for the songs \\"What Do You See\\" and \\"Lying to Myself.\\" That same year, they won the NAMA Best Pop/Rock Album award. Fleming was also nominated for Best Producer. One Nation Under is available through Canyon Records. For the following 5 years, the sibling trio of Blackfire decided to do some interesting renditions of songs and traveled to some exotic places. In 2003, they journeyed to Essakne, Mali in northern Africa. Their performance was included in the compilation album Festival in the Desert, alongside performances by local Tuareg musicians, African musicians like Ali Farka Toure, and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. That same year their political activism attracted the attention of Nora Guthrie, daughter of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie (1912‚Äì1967). She allowed them to set music to some of his unreleased and unpublished lyrics. By next year, they released a two-track EP titled Woody Guthrie Singles. The songs on the EP are called \\"Mean Things Happenin' in this World,\\" a protest song dealing with issues like wars waged for fortune and encroachment of rights by the federal government, and \\" ~~Indian~~ Corn Song,\\" a song about \\"political and big business corruption, the poor economy, and ends with a plea to feed the homeless and orphans.\\"  Vans Warped Tour and [Silence] Is a Weapon (2004‚Äì2008)  In 2005, their dual disk CD/DVD release Beyond Warped had not only their live tracks from the 2004 Vans Warped Tour, but also two covers of Ramones' songs only previously on an Argentinean tribute album Todos Somos Ramones: \\"I Believe in Miracles\\" and \\"Planet Earth 1988.\\" They also won NAMA Group of the Year in 2005 for Woody Guthrie Singles. Two years later, they released their latest album [Silence] is a Weapon. As a dual-disc set featuring their usual brand of hardcore punk rock on one and Jones Benally Family Din√© music on the other, it is truly a juxtaposed album that also shows a more comprehensive aspect of the band. \\"It is very separate [stylistically] but to us it is a whole concept that encompasses what our life is\\" says Jeneda, while Klee explains, \\"I think the traditional songs are maybe even more important for kids to hear than the rock songs, but they both speak of the same things ‚Äì respect for the earth and society, remember your roots.\\" In 2008, [Silence] is a Weapon won NAMA's Album of the Year and Ed Stasium, the producer of the album, received the Native Heart Award that \\"recognizes significant contributions of non-Native folks to Native American music.\\" Clayson Benally at \\"The Unsung Heros of Time '09\\" concert in Kayenta, AZ  Band members  * Clayson Benally ‚Äì percussion, vocals (1989‚Äìpresent) * Jeneda Benally ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals (1989‚Äìpresent) * Klee Benally ‚Äì vocals, guitar (1989‚Äìpresent)  Discography  * Blackfire (Five-song E.P., 1994) * Blackfire (Three-song E.P., 1998) * One Nation Under (2001‚Äì2002) * Woody Guthrie Singles (2003).Woodyguthrie.org.

Biography Born on March 5, 1915 in Skoplje (now Skopje), Kingdom of Serbia, (present-day North Macedonia), Markovski completed his secondary education in Skoplje, later studying Slavic Philology in Sofia. Markovski was a member of the Macedonian Literary Group founded in Skoplje in 1931, the Macedonian Literary Circle in Sofia, Bulgaria (1938‚Äì1941). He is an important figure in contemporary Macedonian literature after has published in 1938, what was to be the first contemporary book written in non-dialectal Macedonian language, \\"Narodni bigori\\". As the most of the left-wing politicians from Macedonia he has changed his ethnic affiliations from Bulgarian to Macedonian during the 1930s, after the recognition of the Macedonian ethnicity from the Comintern. However such Macedonian activists, members of the Bulgarian Communist Party, never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias.Palmer, S. and R. King Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question, Archon Books (June 1971), p. 137. During the World War II, in 1941 he was sent as Communist activist to the concentration camp in Enikyoi by the Bulgarian police. Between 1943 and 1944 he was a Yugoslav partisan in Macedonia, together with his wife and five-year-old son, Mile. He wrote some of the most popular partisan marches songs of the Yugoslav partisans. Markovski participated in the Communist resistance in Vardar Macedonia and was an active political figure in Socialist Macedonia. In the period between 1944-1945 Markovski was present for three commissions for the codification of the Macedonian alphabet. As he recollected many years later, he tried to defend the new republic's alphabet from the \\"complete Serbianization\\", in particularly by idefending the letter yer (—ä), which is used in standard Bulgarian orthography to express the mid back unrounded vowel (IPA ) (also common in many Macedonian dialects), but is absent from the Serbian alphabet. However, Bla≈æe Koneski's point of view won, and Macedonians have no yer in their writing system. Markovski openly supported the Cominform and was subsequently imprisoned at the internment camp in Idrizovo following Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Cominform. In January 1956, Markovski was once again imprisoned, this time serving a five-year hard labor sentence at the notorious labor camp on the island of Goli otok in the Adriatic sea under the name \\"Veniamin Milanov Toshev\\" for publishing‚Äîwhat the authorities considered‚Äîan anti-Titoist poem \\"Contemporary Paradoxes\\" in Serbo- Croatian and for his leanings towards the Soviet Union (see Informbiro). In 1965, he left Yugoslavia supposedly in search of medical treatment in Bulgaria where he would remain until his death in 1988. In 1968 his family were expelled to Bulgaria. Markovski was accepted by the people of Bulgaria and soon began publishing in Bulgarian. Among many poems, dedicated to the ideal of Communism, he wrote a number of sonnets, publishing three books of sonnet crowns, dedicated to various historical figures. Markovski also wrote \\"Saga of Testaments\\", a history of Bulgaria in verses (with a total of 44,444 verses). Venko Markovski was a member of the Bulgarian Writers' Union, and a member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1979), and was awarded highest Bulgarian orders, among them Hero of the Socialist Labour (1975), and Hero of Bulgaria (1985). He was member of several Parliaments from 1971 until his death in 1988. Because of his works written in Bulgarian, Markovski was declared a traitor of the Macedonian nation and in 1975 was under the protection of the Bulgarian secret service as it was believed an assassination was being planned by the Yugoslav secret police, the UDBA. After coming back to his Bulgarian roots and considering his involvement with the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, Markovski stated in an interview for Bulgarian National Television only seven days prior to his death, that the ethnic Macedonians and the Macedonian language are a result of a Comintern conspiracy. Venko Markovski died on January 7, 1988, in Sofia at the age of 72. He was married and had two children, among them the writer Mile Markovski (1939‚Äì1975) and piano teacher Sultana. He has two grandsons - Internet pioneer Veni Markovski and journalist Igor Markovski. He was survived by his wife, Filimena, who died on August 26, 2012.

It also served as a Latin Catholic bishopric, a suffragan of Pelusium, the metropolitan see of the province. History Pliny the Elder (Hist. naturalis, V, xiv) places the town sixty-five miles from Pelusium. Ptolemy (IV, v, 6) locates it in Cassiotis, between Mount Cassius and Rhinocolura. Hierocles, George of Cyprus and other geographers always mention it as in Augustamnica. We learn from Josephus (\\"Bellum Jud.\\", IV, xi, 5) that Vespasian stopped there with his army on the way from Egypt into Palestine; the city then had no ramparts. It received its water from the Delta by a canal. A Roman garrison was stationed there. Le Quien (Oriens christianus, II, 545) speaks of three bishops, Theoctistus, Serapion and Abraham, who lived in the fourth and fifth centuries. There is in this region, near the sea, a small town called Straki, which probably replaced Ostracine.  Jakob Lorber  Jakob Lorber mentioned Ostracine in his The Youth of Jesus (Lorber Verlag - Bietigheim), giving his account of what he received from the Inner Word during the years 1843 to 1851. In this account the Holy Family went to Ostracine with the help of the Roman authorities, especially Governor of Syria Cyrenius, who resided in Tyre at that time and who brought them by his own ship to Ostracine.

Originally formed in 1914 for service during the First World War, the battalion fought at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. The battalion was disbanded in 1919 but was re-raised in 1921 as part of the Citizens Force, and adopted the title of \\"Royal Melbourne Regiment\\" in 1935. The battalion did not serve overseas during the Second World War and was eventually disbanded in 1944. It was re- raised in 1948 and remained in existence until 1960 when it was absorbed into the Royal Victoria Regiment. Today its honours and traditions are maintained by the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History= First World War  Following the outbreak of the First World War, the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force outside of the existing Citizens Force units for overseas service known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The 6th Battalion was completely recruited from Victoria, drawing from Melbourne and the surrounding suburbs to the north where four Citizens Force battalions‚Äîthe 55th, 56th, 63rd and 64th Infantry‚Äîwere headquartered. Raising was complete within a fortnight of the outbreak of the war in August 1914 and less than two months later the battalion embarked for overseas on the troop transport Suffolk, forming part of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division. The battalion proceeded to Egypt, arriving on 2 December and after a period of training it took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, where it went ashore as part of the second wave. Shortly after the landing the 2nd Brigade was transferred from Anzac Cove to Cape Helles to assist in the attack on Krithia. During the unsuccessful attack, the 6th Battalion suffered heavy casualties, losing 133 men killed or died of wounds. Afterwards, they returned to Anzac Cove, arriving there on 17 May, to take part in defending the beachhead that had been established. In August, when the Allies attempted a break out, the battalion took part in the attack on Lone Pine. In September they were withdrawn for a period of rest to Lemnos. They returned in November and resumed defensive duties. By that time, due to the failure of August Offensive, the campaign evolved into a stalemate. They remained in the line December, when the Allies carried out a successful evacuation. During the campaign they lost 22 officers and 398 other ranks killed. Frederick Birks, the 6th Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient, c. 1916 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where they received reinforcements and carried out defensive duties. During this time the AIF was reorganised and expanded as fresh divisions were raised. In order to spread experience across the new units, the existing units were split up and the 6th Battalion provided half its experienced officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) to the 58th Battalion. In March 1916, it sailed to France and deployed to the Somme, where it was sent to a quiet sector near Fleurbaix. Its first combat came on 12 June when the battalion launched a trench raid on the Germans opposite their position. Their first major action in France came later, however, at Pozi√®res in July 1916, during which time they lost 102 men killed. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter, during which time they undertook defensive duties as well as patrols into no man's land. After this the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, before taking part in the Battle of Menin Road in September 1917, when Lieutenant Frederick Birks earned the 6th Battalion's only Victoria Cross. In March and April 1918, the battalion took part in the defensive actions in response to the German spring offensive, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. The 6th Battalion joined the advance the following day, striking out from Villers-Bretonneux and taking part in the capture of Lihons. The battalion continued operations to late September 1918, taking part in the advance towards Herleville, but was then withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation and did not see any further combat. In November, the members of the battalion began being repatriated back to Australia as the demobilisation process began. The process was undertaken gradually based upon length of service and as the battalion's numbers began to dwindle it was amalgamated with the 7th Battalion in March 1919. Later, this battalion was also amalgamated with the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion. During the war the 6th Battalion lost 1,066 killed and 2,017 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, one Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, five Distinguished Service Orders with one Bar, 31 Military Crosses with two Bars, 34 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 127 Military Medals with nine Bars, nine Meritorious Service Medals, 48 Mentions in Despatches and 13 foreign awards. Inter-war years In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re-raising the AIF units as part of the Citizens Force. This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt the identity of the AIF units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many of the pre-war citizen soldiers had served. This was designed so as to maintain the regional identity of the Citizens Forces units, as well as the honours and traditions of the AIF units. In this time the 6th Battalion was re-raised from personnel drawn from six existing units: all of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; as well as part of the 29th Light Horse Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment. Through these units, the battalion gained a complex lineage, including that of the 64th Infantry, a unit that could trace its lineage back to 1854 and claimed to be the oldest infantry unit in Australia. Initially attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 4th Division, in 1927, when territorial titles were adopted by the Army, the battalion adopted the title of 6th Battalion, City of Melbourne Regiment. It also adopted the motto Semper Parartus at this time. In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Forces would be maintained on a part-time, voluntary basis only. It was also renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time. The decision to suspend compulsory training, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units. Nevertheless, the 6th Battalion was not affected by this decision and in 1931 it formed an alliance with the Royal Fusiliers. In 1935, the battalion was re-designated as the \\"Royal Melbourne Regiment\\". This title was officially approved on King George V's jubilee and was a unique honour, as the battalion was at the time the only Australian infantry unit to carry the Royal prefix. Second World War At the outset of the Second World War, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas‚Äîinitial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England‚Äîwhile it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, the decision was made to disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded. Post Second World War In 1948, with the completion of the demobilisation process, the Citizens Force was re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was established on a restricted establishment of two divisions. As a part of this force, it was announced on 1 May 1948 that the 6th Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment would be re-raised. Two companies were formed in Melbourne along with battalion headquarters, while depots were located at Carlton and Preston. It was also decided that the battalion would perpetuate the battle honours of the 2/6th Battalion, which had fought in North Africa, Greece and New Guinea during the war. Waltzing Matilda was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953. In mid-1960, the Australian Army adopted the Pentropic divisional structure, which was based on the establishment of five-company battalions. The result of this was a reduction in the number of CMF units, many of which were merged to form new units on the Pentropic establishment. At the same time, it was decided to amalgamate the old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments, such as the Royal Victoria Regiment. As a result of these changes, in July the 6th Battalion was merged with the 5th Battalion and the 58th/32nd Battalion to form the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (1 RVR); within this organisation the 6th Battalion's identity was maintained by 'C' (Melbourne) Company. Prior to this, in March, the battalion had received the Freedom of the City from the City of Melbourne. In 1965, the Pentropic system was abandoned and a further re-organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas, namely in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. At the same time, the concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations. As a result, the large Pentropic battalions were split up once again and the 6th Battalion once again was raised as a full battalion, known as the 6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. In July 1975, due to declining troop numbers further reorganisation resulted in the amalgamation of the 5th and 6th Battalions once more, albeit under the guise of the 1st Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (1 RVR). This lasted until August 1982 when due to concerns about the strategic situation following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the Australian government announced the expansion of the CMF and decided to raise another battalion in Victoria. This battalion was the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (5/6 RVR) and by mid-1981, 1 RVR had reached peak strength and the following year the battalion was split to form the new 5/6 RVR, a unit which remains in existence today and maintains the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor AIF and Militia units.

The show starred David Jason and Gwen Taylor. It was produced by Yorkshire Television for two series and aired on the ITV network from 13 January to 1 December 1989. The show was set in a fictional Yorkshire town. Each episode took place at a different social function and followed the changing lives of two families, the working-class Simcocks (David Jason, Gwen Taylor, David Thewlis and Wayne Foskett) and the middle-class Rodenhursts (Nicola Pagett, Paul Chapman, Sarah-Jane Holm and Nigel Hastings), together with their respective friends, Rodney and Betty Sillitoe (Tim Wylton and Stephanie Cole), and Neville Badger (Michael Jayston). The series begins with the wedding of Ted and Rita Simcock's son Paul to Laurence and Liz Rodenhurst's daughter Jenny; an event at which Ted and Liz begin an affair. The subsequent fallout from this affair forms the basis for most of the first series. Cast * Ted Simcock (David Jason) ‚Äì a working class Yorkshireman in his early fifties, Ted claims to be proud of his roots and paints himself as very down-to-earth. However, he clearly aspires to climb the social ladder, constantly boasting about the success of his business, the Jupiter Foundry, at functions (with a running joke being that no one has ever heard of it). Ted's downfall is women, having already had three affairs prior to leaving Rita for Liz. * Rita Simcock (also Spragg) (Gwen Taylor) ‚Äì Ted's wife, who begins the series as a homely woman lacking in confidence, obsessed by what others will think of her and her family. However, after Ted's desertion she discovers an inner strength, becoming independent and developing an interest in political and social issues, changing her appearance and even becoming a local councillor. * Liz Rodenhurst (n√©e Ellsworth-Smythe; later Badger) (Nicola Pagett) ‚Äì an attractive, confident and sexually promiscuous woman, Liz is in many ways the polar opposite of Rita; although like Rita, her social standing is her chief concern in life. Her husband Laurence tolerates her affairs as long as she's discreet; a weakness for 'bits of rough' leads her to Ted. A seemingly cold woman, Liz finally shows genuine emotion when she loses her second husband, Neville, in a car crash. * Laurence Rodenhurst (Paul Chapman) ‚Äì An emotionally repressed, 'stiff upper lip' middle class dentist, Laurence is obsessed with behaving properly and his public image. He seems uninterested in Liz's affairs as long as they don't embarrass him socially, and has high expectations of his children. Most people consider him cold and emotionless, making his suicide after Liz leaves him all the more shocking. * Neville Badger (Michael Jayston) ‚Äì Laurence's recently widowed oldest friend. A respected lawyer, he finds it impossible to hide his grief over wife Jane's death, and is deeply shamed to have publicly revealed it. He later marries Liz, after which he becomes almost unbearably upbeat about life. He is killed in a car crash (off-screen), his funeral being the focus of the penultimate episode. * Betty Sillitoe (Stephanie Cole) ‚Äì Rita's oldest friend; a kind and loving woman with two key vices ‚Äì gossip and alcohol. She tries hard to help her friends but normally makes things worse. She and husband Rodney have a famously happy marriage, and equally famously get drunk alternately at functions. * Rodney Sillitoe (Tim Wylton) ‚Äì Betty's husband and Ted's oldest friend. Like his beloved wife, Rodney is kind and loving, but let down by his penchant for drink. He owns a battery chicken farm, Cock-a-doodle Chickens, and claims to feel no guilt about this; however, this changes when he is drunk, leading him to feel very depressed. * Jenny Simcock (n√©e Rodenhurst) (Sarah-Jane Holm) ‚Äì Liz and Laurence's idealistic daughter, whose marriage to Paul Simcock introduces the families. She is deeply concerned by social and political issues such as feminism, poverty and starvation in Africa and is strongly moral; however, she is actually somewhat naive about the real world. She has a complicated love life, entering a relationship with her brother-in- law Elvis after splitting from Paul, later leaving Elvis to reunite with his brother. * Paul Simcock (David Thewlis) ‚Äì Ted and Rita's younger son; a self- confessed 'great wet slob' until he meets Jenny, and begins to share her political and social concerns. Like Jenny, he is a very intense character whose morals are offended by Ted and Liz's affair; however, he breaks his own code by having a drunken one-night stand with Carol Fordingbridge. Paul is not seen on-screen in series two, but is mentioned in each episode. * Elvis Simcock (Wayne Foskett) ‚Äì Ted and Rita's elder son. Elvis is a Philosophy graduate and sees himself as very intelligent; however, he finds thinking is not a quality that counts for much when job-hunting. After a short relationship he and Carol (his brother's former lover) become engaged; however, this ends because Elvis constantly makes Carol feel inferior. He later starts a relationship with his sister-in-law Jenny, but eventually loses out to Paul. He has a tempestuous relationship with Jenny's brother Simon, the two frequently arguing due to their opposing world views, but at times there are signs a friendship will develop. * Simon Rodenhurst (Nigel Hastings) ‚Äì Liz and Laurence's son, he's adored by Liz, but has a more difficult relationship with his father. A successful estate agent but a flop with women, he frequently clashes with cynical philosopher Elvis, who sees Simon as morally bankrupt. After his first sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy (with Neville's nephew's wife being the mother) Simon turns to celibacy, but changes his mind after he meets Lucinda Snellmarsh, an equally ill-at-ease estate agent. * Carol Fordingbridge (Karen Drury) ‚Äì Laurence's former receptionist who has a one-night stand with Paul. After starting a job at Cock-a-doodle Chickens, Carol becomes engaged to Elvis. Although attractive and outgoing, Carol lacks confidence in her intellect, particularly as Elvis seems embarrassed by her (later causing them to split up). Initially disliked by Rita because of her role in Paul and Jenny's break-up, Carol becomes something of her protege, and begins retaking her A Levels as a result of her encouragement. * Sandra Pickersgill (later Simcock) (Tracy Brabin) ‚Äì A good- hearted but notoriously clumsy waitress who begins a relationship with Ted, despite an age gap of over twenty years. She's down-to-earth and doesn't share Ted's desire to impress socially. She's devastated when Ted ends things with her to marry Corinna; however, she eventually forgives him and becomes his second wife in the final episode. * Lucinda Snellmarsh (Amanda Wenban) ‚Äì Simon's girlfriend (and later fiancee) from series two onwards. Like him, she's a socially awkward estate agent; however, when Simon loses his job she proves surprisingly assertive in rescuing his career. * Geoffrey Ellsworth- Smythe (later Spragg) (Malcolm Tierney) ‚Äì Liz's brother; an anthropologist who returns to the UK after over twenty years in Africa and, to Liz's horror, begins a relationship with Rita. He and Liz are not close and he doesn't share her snobbery. He takes Rita's maiden name at their marriage. * Corinna Price- Rodgerson (Diana Weston) ‚Äì an upper-class, sophisticated businesswoman who sets her sights on Ted, breaking up his relationship with Sandra. She persuades Ted they should open a restaurant in Africa; however, on the night of their farewell party she is arrested at the airport and revealed to be a con artist, real name Mavis Stant. * Gerry Lansdowne (David Yelland) ‚Äì an ambitious young politician who begins a relationship with older woman Rita after her marriage break-up. Rita jilts him on their wedding day after realising she will come second to his political aspirations. * Eric the Barman (Malcolm Hebden) ‚Äì a camp, over-talkative barman at The Angel Hotel, who frequently attempts to engage the regulars in long-winded stories, usually involving his 'ex-brother-in-law from Falkirk'. * Percy and Clarrie Spragg (Keith Marsh and Maggie Jones) ‚Äì Rita's parents. Rita is frequently embarrassed by her father's coarse behaviour, which he in turn plays up to. However, he genuinely loves his daughter, and she is touched by his anger at Ted's behaviour. Rita is devastated when Percy dies in her arms on the dancefloor; Clarrie later dies off-screen in hospital. * Andrew Denton (Philip Bird) ‚Äì Neville's nephew, well known for making unfunny or inappropriate quips and following them with 'joke!', usually to the annoyance or bemusement of his audience. He proudly celebrates his wife Judy's pregnancy, having previously believed he was sterile, unaware that the real father is Simon. Episode list=Series 1 (1989)Series 2 (1989)=Background Pat Sandys who had produced one of David Nobbs' plays Cupid's Darts was looking for plays for a series called Love and Marriage. The three ideas put forward by David Nobbs were a dentists' dinner dance, a Miss Ball Bearing competition and a diamond wedding. Though the ideas were not used, David Nobbs came up with the idea of having the same characters in different do's. Casting Gwen Taylor as Rita came first. David Nobbs wanted John Thaw and several others to play Ted Simcock, before David Jason was chosen. The church seen in cartoon form in the opening title sequence is St John the Baptist Church in the town centre of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The lead spire with a criss-cross pattern and with a cockerel weather vane on top, and the clock with curved wording above it, both match between the drawing and the real church.

Raised in 1914 as part of the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, the battalion was completely recruited from the state of Victoria and formed the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division. The battalion served during the Gallipoli campaign where it had the distinction of having four of its members awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1916, it was transferred to Europe, fighting in the trenches along the Western Front for the next two and a half years. Although disbanded in 1919 following the end of hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding following the Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following the suspension of the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe. During the Second World War, the 7th Battalion served primarily in a garrison role, firstly being used to defend the Australian mainland before deploying late in the war to take part in the Bougainville campaign in 1944‚Äì1945. On Bougainville, as part of the 23rd Brigade, they took part in the fighting in the central sector of the island in the last months of the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion was once again used in the garrison role before being returned to Australia and disbanding in early 1946. In 1948, the battalion was re-raised as an amalgamated unit with the 8th Battalion when the Citizens Military Force was reformed. Today, it exists as the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History=First World WarFormation= Following the outbreak of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight. While this force would draw from the military forces that already existed‚Äîthe part-time Citizens Force and the Permanent Military Force‚Äîit would be largely be made up from recruits not currently serving. Known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), initially it was to consist of 20,000 men, comprising one infantry division and a light horse brigade. Recruitment for the first intake began on 10 August 1914, and the 7th Battalion was among the first units raised, forming less than a fortnight after the declaration of war. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harold Elliot, the battalion was brigaded with the 5th, 6th and 8th Battalions to form the 2nd Brigade under Brigadier James Whiteside McCay. Elliott took personal control over the recruitment process, selecting only those officers that he had known from his service in the Citizens Forces as his company commanders, who he in turn entrusted with choosing their own subordinates. Recruitment was conducted over a period of three weeks and by the end of the period the process had been so successful that the battalion was over establishment. Initially, the battalion was organised into eight companies, designated 'A' to 'H', while recruitment and initial training was undertaken at Broadmeadows, however, this was later reduced to the new British standard four companies of double the size, designated 'A' to 'D'. =Gallipoli= In September the battalion marched through the city of Melbourne and a fortnight later they embarked upon HMT Hororata bound for the Middle East. They arrived in Egypt on 2 December 1914 after which they undertook further training before being called to undertake defensive duties along the Suez Canal following the failed Turkish First Suez Offensive in February 1915. However the battalion did not take part in direct combat, and during this time a number of its non-commissioned officers were allowed to apply for commissions in British Army units. In early April the battalion was moved to Alexandria and from there on to Lemnos Island. On the morning of 25 April 1915, the battalion took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore as part of the second wave. Over the course of the first week the battalion was involved in establishing the beachhead and suffered heavily, losing five officers and 179 men killed or died of wounds. This was higher than any other subsequent battle that the battalion fought during the war. On 29 April, the 2nd Brigade was relieved by the 12th (Deal) Battalion and in early May the battalion was able to reorganise itself after its baptism of fire. The respite did not last long, however, for only ten days after the landing at Anzac Cove, the 2nd Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles in order to take part in an attack on Krithia on 8 May 1915. The attack was a very costly failure, with the battalion losing a further six officers and 87 men killed. Nevertheless, they were involved in what is believed to be the first brigade-level attack conducted by an Australian force against an entrenched enemy and the attack earned the Victorians many plaudits. After the attack the battalion was given a weeks rest at Cape Helles, where it received a number of reinforcements before being sent back to the lodgement at Anzac Cove, where a stalemate situation had developed. In an effort to break this deadlock, the Allies launched an offensive in August and the battalion took part in the Battle of Lone Pine. After taking over positions that had been captured by the 1st Brigade, the battalion defended the trenches against repeated Turkish counterattacks and, in the process, four of its members performed acts of gallantry that later led to them receiving the Victoria Cross (VC), the nation's highest military decoration. These men were: Corporal Alexander Stewart Burton, Corporal William Dunstan, Lieutenant William John Symons and Lieutenant Frederick Harold Tubb. Sergeant Ball and Corporal H. Webb received the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM). According to Ron Austin, during this fighting, the 7th Battalion lost 87 men killed; Arthur Dean and Eric Gutteridge give the total casualties as twelve out of fourteen officers and 680 Other Ranks. Despite the battalion's success in holding the trenches at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed to break the deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate and for the rest of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the trenches even as they were being evacuated. =Western Front= After Gallipoli the 7th Battalion was withdrawn to Egypt, where the AIF underwent a period of reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to Europe. The 7th Battalion was split to provide a cadre for the 59th Battalion which was being raised as part of the doubling of the Australian forces. In March 1916, they sailed to France where for the next two and half years they would take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Upon arrival, the battalion was sent to the Somme, where its first major action came in July during the Battle of Pozi√®res. Throughout July and into August, the battalion was committed to the fighting twice, losing 55 men killed in the first battle and another 83 in the second. In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a frontage equal to just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres‚ÄìCommines canal. During this time they were not involved in any major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force roughly equivalent to two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing a section of the German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing. In October, the battalion returned to the Somme where they spent the winter months manning trenches and training. In early 1917, precipitated by the loss of the high ground around Pozi√®res, the Germans withdrew back to the Hindenburg Line in order to shorten their defensive line and to straighten a salient that had developed. In February, the German withdrawal was discovered and the Allies, finding an open battlefield for the first time since 1914 and believing that the German Army was suffering from limited manpower, began an advance to follow them up. On the night of 26/27 February, the 7th Battalion launched what was meant to be a trench raid, but turned into an open advance, seeing them extend their lines by . The Allied advance, however, was brief as the Germans had established themselves in strength, and was halted before the Australians reached Bullecourt. In May the battalion was withdrawn from the front line for re-organisation and training. It did not return until the Third Battle of Ypres in September and October 1917, when they were committed to the fighting first at Menin Road. The 7th Battalion had 57 men killed in this phase, and then later at Broodseinde another 98 were killed. Following these battles, the 7th Battalion was withdrawn from the front line once more in December. In March 1918, however, following the start of the German Spring Offensive, the battalion was called back to help stem the tide of the German advance. As the German offensive ran out of momentum, the battalion kept up the pressure on the German line through a series of peaceful penetrations, before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. As a part of this offensive, the battalion fought major actions at Lihons on 9‚Äì11 August where they captured a number of German mortars and Herleville Woods on 23 August. They continued operations until late September 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and it was out of the line when the armistice came into effect in November. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and as the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated back to Australia, it was amalgamated with 6th Battalion. This battalion was amalgamated with another, formed from the 5th and 8th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion. Throughout their service during the war, the battalion suffered 1,045 killed and 2,076 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: four VCs, one Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), two Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), 20 Military Crosses (MCs) with two Bars, 31 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs) with one Bar, 100 Military Medals (MMs) with five Bars, six Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs), 37 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs) and six foreign awards. The battalion received a total of 26 battle honours for its service during the war. Inter war years In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the battle honours and traditions of the AIF battalions that had served during World War I by reorganising the Citizens Force along AIF lines, with previously existing part-time units adopting the numerical designations of the AIF units that had been drawn from their traditional recruitment territories. In May 1921, the 7th Battalion was reformed in regional Victoria around a headquarters in Mildura, with depots at Merbein, Wentworth and Red Cliffs. At this time, the battalion drew its personnel from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment. Through its link with these units, the battalion inherited the battle honour of \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì102\\". In 1927, when territorial titles were introduced into the Militia, the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Mount Alexander Regiment\\". It was also granted the motto Cede Nullius at this time. In 1929, however, the compulsory training scheme was suspended by the newly elected Scullin Labor government. In its place a voluntary system was established and the Citizens Force renamed the \\"Militia\\". The end of compulsory training, coupled with low levels of defence spending and economic hardships brought about by the Great Depression greatly reduced the manpower available to many Militia units at this time and as a result a number of units were disbanded or amalgamated at this time. The 7th Battalion was also affected and on 1 July 1929 it was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion to form the 7th/38th Battalion. The two battalions remained linked until 9 November 1936 when, following concerns about growing tensions in Europe, it was decided to delink them in order to double the size of the Militia as the prospect of another war became apparent. In 1937, the battalion's designation was changed to the \\"North Murray Borderers\\". Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Australian government once again decided to raise an all volunteer force for service overseas as the legal restrictions on employing the Militia outside of Australia still applied. Regardless a number of Militia units attempted to join up en masse as already formed units and the 7th Battalion was one of these units. However, as they were required to remain in Australia to provide home defence in the case of war spreading to the Pacific this did not occur. In October 1939, the Militia was mobilised in stages to undertake a short period of 30 days continuous training and this was undertaken again in 1940, but for a period of 90 days instead. The compulsory training scheme was also reintroduced and the 7th Battalion's ranks were filled out with national servicemen. Throughout 1940 and 1941 the battalion undertook a number of training camps in Victoria. In December 1941, with Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Malaya and Pearl Harbor, the battalion was mobilised for war service and tasked with defending the Dandenong area. In 1942, however, it received orders to move north to Darwin, where it carried out garrison duties to defend the town and experienced a number air raids from Japanese aircraft. During this time also, the battalion was transferred to the 23rd Brigade. Originally the 23rd Brigade had been part of the 8th Division and made up of Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) battalions, however, after these units were captured or destroyed on Rabaul, Ambon and Timor, it had been rebuilt using Militia battalions and placed under the command of Brigadier Arnold Potts, and assigned to the 12th Division. They remained in Darwin for 18 months before being relieved and sent back to Melbourne in April 1943. After taking leave, the 7th Battalion was sent to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for a period of intensive pre-deployment training in November. In 1944 the 23rd Brigade had been attached to the II Corps, which was tasked with taking over from the Americans and launching a renewed offensive on Bougainville. The 23rd Brigade was given the task of relieving the garrisons in the outer islands and the 7th Battalion was primarily responsible for Mono island, although one company was detached to Munda, arriving there in October 1944. Tasked with defending the airfield from a Japanese attack that was at best remote, some members of the battalion sought to enliven their existence by acting as crews on US Navy PT boats carrying out raids on New Britain and New Ireland. In April 1945, after months of lobbying by Potts‚Äîwho was keen to get back into action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign‚Äîthe 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over the course of the next three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers. Following the end of hostilities the battalion moved to the island of Fauro to guard Japanese prisoners of war. As the demobilisation process began, members of the battalion were slowly repatriated to Australia, while others were transferred to other units for further service elsewhere. By March 1946 the last of the battalion's personnel had been returned to Australia and on 10 May 1946, the 7th Battalion was formally disbanded. During its service throughout the war the battalion lost 25 men killed or died on active service, with a further 50 men wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: one DSO, one MC, one MM and 16 MIDs. Legacy Following the completion of the demobilisation process, the Citizens Military Force was reformed in 1948, albeit on a reduced scale. At this time, the 7th Battalion was not re-raised in its own right, although an amalgamated unit known as the 8th/7th Battalion (North Western Victorian Regiment) was formed in order to perpetuate the two rural Victorian battalions. Today the honours and traditions of the 7th Battalion are maintained by the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment, an infantry battalion of the Australian Army Reserve, that was formed in 1960 as the 2nd Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment, following the introduction of the Pentropic organisation, but which was later redesignated 8/7 RVR. The 7th Battalion's battle honours include those of the 2nd AIF's 2/7th Battalion, which were entrusted to the 7th in 1961.

The city is mostly known for being the traditional centre of coal mining in Chile, albeit mining ended in the 1990s. History The first Spanish settlement at this site, Santa Maria de Guadalupe, was founded by the governor √Ångel de Peredo on October 12, 1662 but it did not survive long amidst the hostilities of the Arauco War. The modern city is linked to the coal mining industry that started in the nineteenth century. The first coal seams to be exploited were easy to work because they lay almost at ground level. Coal mining started after the arrival of steamships at the port of Talcahuano. These steam ships, mostly from Britain, initially bought the coal very cheaply. Industrialist Mat√≠as Cousi√±o begun mining operations in Lota in 1852. Coal mining transformed Lota from being a sparsely populated frontier zone in the mid-19th century into a large industrial hub that attracted immigrants from all over Chile well into the 20th century. Lota was established officially as a town on January 5, 1875 and became a city on November 30, 1881. The name Lota is thought to be derived from the Mapudungun word Louta meaning small piece of land. In 1960 miners and their families started a general strike demanding higher salaries. As protesters marched on Concepci√≥n the 1960 Concepci√≥n earthquake struck the territory ending the strike. During much of the 20th century the city was a stronghold of pro-Soviet communism. The city's coal mines were nationalized in 1971 by Salvador Allende, a move that was welcomed by miners. When Allende was overthrown and a military dictatorship established, Lota's political parties and powerful trade unions were forbidden. People active in these organizations were persecuted, and in some instances killed by the military. Much of the local press was suppressed as it had links to either the trade unions or political parties. In the late 20th century Lota's coal industry began to struggle for markets as the furnaces, shipping industry and trains, all of whom were important buyers of coal, shifted to other energy sources. There had been concerns as early as the 1920s about the vulnerability of the coal- dependent local economy. One of the problems of Lota's coal industry was difficulty in mechanizing as the coal beds were thin in nature and displaced by many geological faults.Carb√≥n mantiene su sitial en Chile Costs also increased as wooden mining supports became more expensive, easily accessible coal beds were depleted and mining had to be done below the sea bed. The mines were closed in the 1990s after demand for Lota's coal resources diminished and cheaper Colombian coal arrived on the market, plunging the residents of Lota into poverty. The end came in 1997 when Empresa Nacional del Carb√≥n closed the mines and sold the industrial equipment. Subsequently, the mines flooded. Tourism, forestry, artisan fishing and small-scale entrepreneurship have replaced mining as sources of employment, but older miners have found it difficult to adapt. Despite the decline of the coal industry, the Lota community continues to identify with it. Compared to the 1960s and 1970s the city is very much depoliticized; evidence of this is the fact some evangelical churches have more attendants than the offices of political parties.

Of these, 48,975 (99.8%) lived in urban areas and 114 (0.2%) in rural areas. The population fell by 2.3% (1167 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. In the last years of the 2000s the population fell below 40,000 meaning that the population had halved since the 1980s when it was about 80,000. Administration As a commune, Lota is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde was Patricio Marchant Ulloa (PDC). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Lota has been represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Manuel Monsalve (PS) and Iv√°n Norambuena (UDI) as part of the 46th electoral district, (comprising Lota, Lebu, Arauco, Curanilahue, Los √Ålamos, Ca√±ete, Contulmo and Tir√∫a).

Christian Scriver (2 January 1629 - 5 April 1693) was a German Lutheran minister and devotional writer. Christian Scriver (Store norske leksikon) Biography Christian Scriver was born at Rendsburg in the Duchy of Schleswig, Germany. He entered the University of Rostock in 1647. He was awarded a master's degree in Theology in 1651. During 1653, he was appointed archdeacon at Stendal. He was called in 1667 to Magdeburg in Saxony as pastor of St. James's Church (Sankt-Jakobi-Kirche Magdeburg). Here he remained twenty-three years, until in 1690 he was made chief court chaplain at Quedlinburg, a position which he held until his death. Immatrikulation von Christianus Schriverius (Universit√§t Rostock)Promotion zum Magister von Christianum Schriverium(Universit√§t Rostock) The friend of Philipp Jakob Spener, Scriver was one of those theologians of the latter part of the seventeenth century who opposed the formalism then besetting Lutheranism, and thus prepared the way for Pietism, even while himself maintaining strict orthodoxy. Scriver died in Quedlinburg.ADB:Scriver, Christian (Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie) The writings of Scriver were devotional, including Gottholds vierhundert zuf√§llige Andachten (1667; last ed., Basel, 1893; Eng. transl., (Gotthold's Emblems: or, Invisible Things understood by Things that are made), by R.

It was a sovereign member state of the German Confederation and became a federated state of the North German Confederation and finally of the German Empire in 1872. Geography Like its predecessor, the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the Schwerin lands upon the incorporation of the extinct Duchy of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow in 1701 comprised the larger central and western parts of the historic Mecklenburg region. The smaller southeastern part was held by the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz branch of the grand ducal house, who also ruled over the lands of the former Bishopric of Ratzeburg in the far northwest. The grand duchy was bounded by the Baltic coast in the north and the Prussian province of Pomerania in the northeast, where the border with the Hither Pomeranian (formerly Swedish Pomeranian) region ran along the Recknitz river, the Peene, and Kummerower See. In the south it bordered with the Prussian province of Brandenburg (with the exclaves of Rossow and Sch√∂nberg near Wittstock) and in the southwest with the Amt Neuhaus district held by the Kingdom of Hanover, which was incorporated into the Prussian province of Hanover after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Likewise in the west, the Duchy of Holstein was incorporated into the Schleswig-Holstein Province, after which Mecklenburg was almost entirely surrounded by Prussian territory. Beside the capital at Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Schwerin comprised the coastal cities of Rostock and Wismar, which had been held by the Swedish crown until 1803, as well as the inland towns of Parchim and G√ºstrow. History In the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars Duke Frederick Francis I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin had remained neutral, and in 1803 he regained Wismar, which was pawned to him from Sweden. After Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Austerlitz and the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, he joined the Confederation of the Rhine by a treaty of 22 March 1808. Napoleon, in preparation for the French invasion of Russia in 1812, disregarded this alliance; he offered the duchy to the Swedish heir apparent Jean Bernadotte for his support. Duke Frederick Francis was the first member of the confederation to abandon Napoleon, to whose armies he had sent a contingent, and in the following War of the Sixth Coalition he fought against the troops of the First French Empire ‚Äîwith the result that his new allies, Prussia and Russia, now offered his duchy to the Kingdom of Denmark. Instead, Denmark was promised the adjacent lands of Swedish Pomerania by the 1814 Peace of Kiel and the rule of the Mecklenburg dukes remained inviolate. At the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Frederick Francis joined the newly established German Confederation, and like his Strelitz cousin Charles II, was elevated to the title of a \\"Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\\". In 1819 serfdom was finally abolished in his dominions. The Mecklenburg governance was still determined by the 1755 inheritance agreement (Landesgrundgesetzlicher Erbvergleich), which upheld the medieval hierarchy of the estates, which largely affected the social and economic development of both grand duchies. During the revolutions of 1848, the duchy witnessed a considerable agitation in favour of a liberal constitution. On 10 October 1849 Grand Duke Frederick Francis II (1823‚Äì1883) granted a new Basic law elaborated by his First Minister Ludwig von L√ºtzow. In the subsequent reaction of the Mecklenburg nobility, backed by the Strelitz grand duke George, all the concessions which had been made to democracy were withdrawn and further restrictive measures were introduced in 1851 and 1852. In the dispute over neighbouring Holstein which culminated in the 1866 Austro- Prussian War, Frederick Francis II supported the Kingdom of Prussia, whom he aided with Mecklenburg-Schwerin soldiers. His grand duchy began to pass more and more under Prussian influence. In 1867 he joined the North German Confederation and the Zollverein. In the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871), Prussia again received valuable assistance from Grand Duke Frederick Francis II, who was an ardent advocate of German unity and held a high command in her armies. In the course of the German unification in 1871, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz became states of the German Empire. There was now renewed agitation for a more democratic constitution, and the German Reichstag parliament gave some countenance to this movement. In 1897 Frederick Francis IV (b. 1882) succeeded his father Frederick Francis III (1851‚Äì1897) as the last grand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In 1907 the Grand Duke promised a constitution to his subjects. The duchy had always been under a feudal system of government, the grand duke having the executive entirely in his hands (though acting through ministers). The duchy shared a diet (Landtag), which met for a short session each year. At other times they were represented by a committee consisting of the proprietors of knights' estates (Ritterg√ºter), known as the Ritterschaft, and the Landschaft, or burgomasters of certain towns. Mecklenburg-Schwerin returned six members to the Reichstag. Upon the suicide of his cousin Grand Duke Adolphus Frederick VI on 23 February 1918, Frederick Francis served as regent of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Shortly afterwards, on 14 November, he was forced to renounce the Mecklenburg throne in the course of the German Revolution. The grand duchy turned into the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a federated state of the Weimar Republic. Thereby ended nearly eight centuries of continuous rule (only interrupted by Albrecht von Wallenstein from 1628 to 1630) by the originally Obotrite (West Slavic) Mecklenburg dynasty, beginning with their progenitor Prince Niklot (d. 1160). Until 1918 the grand duke was styled as \\"Prince of the Wends\\".

This means that if light enters port 1 it is emitted from port 2, but if some of the emitted light is reflected back to the circulator, it does not come out of port 1 but instead exits from port 3. This is analogous to the operation of an electronic circulator. Fiber-optic circulators are used to separate optical signals that travel in opposite directions in an optical fiber, for example to achieve bi-directional transmission over a single fiber. Because of their high isolation of the input and reflected optical powers and their low insertion loss, optical circulators are widely used in advanced communication systems and fiber-optic sensor applications. Optical circulators are non-reciprocal optics, which means that changes in the properties of light passing through the device are not reversed when the light passes through in the opposite direction. This can only happen when the symmetry of the system is broken, for example by an external magnetic field. A Faraday rotator is another example of a non-reciprocal optical device, and indeed it is possible to construct an optical circulator based on a Faraday rotator.

It had Slovak inhabitants. The old Litava castle in late 13th century Scarce ruins of the old Litava castle can be found south-west of Cerovo on the northern end of the Pust√Ω hrad mountain. The Litava Castle was built by Hunt or his son, Big Der≈æ (Der≈°, Hungarian: Ders) from the Hunt-Poznan family. The castle was first mentioned in 1276. In this year the grandchildren of Lambert, of the Hunt- Poznan family, Small Der≈æ (Ders) and Demeter captured Litava and robbed valuables of 3000 marks and charters. Therefore, the king confiscated their property and gave their property to Big Der≈æ from the Hunt-Poznan family. Before 1307 Nicholas T√∫ri K√∂v√©r, son of Big Der≈æ of the Hunt-Poznan family, exchanged the castle Litava with his relatives, Der≈æ and Demeter of Hunt. In 1318 master Tom√°≈°, son of Der≈æ of the Hunt-Poznan family, protested against the occupation of Litava by Matthew III Cs√°k. The castle perished not long after, probably during struggles of the oligarchs. But a new castle was built 3 kilometres north-west of the old Litava castle. It was called Litava too until the middle of the 15th century when the new castle would be called ƒåabraƒè (also called Litava, Haradnuk, Haradnok, Chabrad, Chabragh, Lytva, Hradnok, Haradna, Castrum ad Litavan etc.). In 1342 the king debarred the new castle together with the old ruined Litava and 26 villages and 6 customs from Peter and Leukus of the Dobrakutyai family because of their treachery according to a charter. The village became deserted in the beginning of the 15th century. It became populated again only after Hussite struggles. The local population converted into Lutheran faith in the 16th century. The present Lutheran church was built between 1855 and 1859.

It is particularly applied to systems where the duplicated components work in parallel, particularly in fault-tolerant computer systems. A typical example is a complex computer system which has duplicated nodes, so that should one node fail, another is ready to carry on its work. DMR provides robustness to the failure of one component, and error detection in case instruments or computers that should give the same result give different results, but does not provide error correction, as which component is correct and which is malfunctioning cannot be automatically determined. There is an old adage to this effect, stating: \\"Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three.\\" Meaning, if two chronometers contradict, how do you know which one is correct? A lockstep fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. Examples include 1ESS switch. A machine with three replications of each element is termed triple modular redundant (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications. Examples The Submarine Command System SMCS used on submarines of the Royal Navy employs duplicated central computing nodes, interconnected by a duplicated LAN.

Initially raised in 1914 for the First Australian Imperial Force during the First World War the battalion was completely recruited from Victoria and formed part of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division. During the war it fought at Gallipoli and in France and Belgium on the Western Front. It was disbanded in 1919, before being re-raised as a Militia battalion in 1921. During the Second World War the 8th Battalion was used primarily as a garrison unit before taking part in the Bougainville campaign late in the war. It was disbanded again in 1946 during the demobilisation process, although it was reformed again in 1948 when it was amalgamated with the 7th Battalion. Today, its honours and traditions are perpetuated by the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. History=First World War The 8th Battalion was raised within two weeks of the start of the First World War. The majority of its personnel were drawn from volunteers for overseas service from rural Victoria and after undertaking rudimentary training the battalion, attached to the 2nd Brigade, departed Australia two months later, heading for Egypt. The Australians arrived in Egypt on 2 December 1914 and following this they undertook further training and briefly taking part in the defence of the Suez Canal from the Turks following the First Suez Offensive.Austin 1997, pp. 28‚Äì31. The Turkish offensive ended before the battalion could see any action.Austin 1997, p. 32. Following this, the battalion remained in Egypt before being transported to Lemnos Island in early April in preparation for their involvement in the Gallipoli campaign.Austin 1997, p. 37. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Kinsey Bolton, they took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, coming ashore as part of the second wave on 25 April 1915. Private David Mills gave this eye-witness account of the landing: This is his last diary entry, he was killed during the landing. Members of the 2nd and 8th Battalions at Lone Pine, 1915 Ten days after the initial landing at Anzac Cove, the 2nd Brigade was transferred from Anzac Cove to Cape Helles to assist in the British and French attack on Krithia, where they carried out a largely unsuccessful assault before being brought back to the Australian lodgement at Anzac. In August, the battalion took part in the attack on Lone Pine, as the Allies attempted to break the stalemate that had developed on the peninsula. The August Offensive proved unsuccessful, however, and for the remainder of the campaign the 8th Battalion carried out mainly defensive duties before being evacuated along with the rest of the Anzac force in December 1915. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt where the Australian Imperial Force underwent a period of re-organisation and expansion in preparation for deployment to the Western Front.Grey 2008, pp. 99‚Äì100. As a part of this re- organisation, the AIF was expanded and the 8th Battalion provided a cadre of experienced staff to form the 60th Battalion. In March 1916, the 8th Battalion embarked for France and after arriving there shortly afterwards, it took up a position in the trenches on the Somme battlefield. The battalion's first major action in France came at Pozi√®res in July 1916, during which Private Thomas Cooke performed the actions for which he was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter. Throughout 1917 they took part in operations against the Hindenburg Line, before being involved in the Third Battle of Ypres. Following the launch of the German spring offensive in March and April 1918, the 8th Battalion took part in defensive operations, before participating in the Battle of Amiens, as the Allies launched their own counter offensive on 8 August 1918; an offensive that ultimately brought about an end to the war. During the attack near Amiens, one of the battalion's subalterns, Lieutenant William Joynt, took command when his company commander was killed and led the company in a bayonet charge that resulted in the capture of 80 prisoners of war. For this feat, he was subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross. The next day, Private Robert Matthew Beatham also earned a Victoria Cross by rushing five separate machine gun positions. The battalion continued operations until late September 1918, when, suffering severe manpower shortages, the Australian Corps was withdrawn from the line for rest and re-organisation. They were subsequently out of the line when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 and the war came to an end.Odgers 1994, p. 127. Shortly afterwards the demobilisation process began and members from the battalion were gradually repatriated to Australia, while others were sent to England and France to undertake training to provide them with skills for civilian life following discharge. By April 1919 the battalion's numbers had been reduced to the extent that they were amalgamated with 5th Battalion. This battalion was subsequently amalgamated with another, formed from the 6th and 7th Battalions, to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion, before finally being disbanded. Throughout the course of the war, the 8th Battalion suffered 877 killed and 2,410 wounded. Its members received the following decorations: three Victoria Crosses, 10 Distinguished Service Orders and one Bar, 33 Military Crosses and six Bars, 43 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 32 Military Medals and one Bar, four MSMs, 45 Mentions in Despatches and nine foreign awards. Inter war years and the Second World War Later, in 1921, the 8th Battalion was re-raised as a Militia unit in Victoria, adopting the AIF unit's colour patch and taking custody of its battle honours. At this time it was assigned to the 6th Brigade, which formed part of the 4th Division.Palazzo 2001, p. 102. Upon re-formation, the battalion drew personnel from three previously existing part-time units: the 8th Infantry Regiment, the 39th Infantry Regiment and 6th Field Ambulance. Through these units, the 8th Battalion inherited the \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\" battle honour.Festberg 1972, p. 66. In 1927, territorial titles were adopted and the battalion took on the designation of 8th Battalion (City of Ballarat Regiment). During this time the battalion had companies in Ararat, Stawell, and Daylesford, although its headquarters was established in Ballarat, Victoria. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 8th Battalion undertook a period of continuous training in 1939 and then again in 1940 as part of the general plan to increase the readiness of Australia's home defences. At this time it was assigned to the 6th Brigade along with the 7th and 38th Battalions. Following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941 the battalion was moved to Darwin where it was transferred to the 23rd Brigade, which had been previously made up of units of the Second Australian Imperial Force but which had largely been destroyed in Malaya and subsequently reformed as a Militia formation consisting of the 7th, 8th and 27th Battalions. The 8th remained in Darwin on defensive duties until September 1943 when its personnel were given a months leave in Melbourne before moving to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for training prior to deployment overseas. In May 1944, they moved to Lae, where they remained until October 1944 when the 23rd Brigade relieved the American forces garrisoning the Outer Islands. During this time the 8th Battalion were stationed on Emirau Island, where a number of its personnel crewed United States Navy PT boats and took part in raiding operations around New Britain and New Ireland. Frank Partridge, who received the Victoria Cross for actions on Bougainville in 1945 In 1945, the battalion finally received its chance to take part in the fighting against the Japanese when they were moved from the Outer Islands to Soraken and took part in the final phases on the Bougainville campaign. During the fighting that it took part in during late July around Ratsua, one of the 8th Battalion's members, Private Frank John Partridge carried out the deeds for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Partridge's award was the first such award made to an Australian soldier serving in the Militia. This battalion was disbanded on 2 May 1946. It suffered 49 casualties during its active service on Bougainville, of which 19 were killed. Its members received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, two Military Medals, and eight Mentions in Despatches. Post Second World War In 1948, the 8th Battalion was re-raised as part of the reconstituted Citizen Military Force. At this time the 8th and 7th Battalions were amalgamated to form the 8th/7th Battalion, the North Western Victorian Regiment. Today this unit is known as the 8th/7th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (8/7 RVR), a unit of the Australian Army Reserve, and it serves as the custodian of 8th Battalion's battle honours and traditions.Shaw 2010, pp. 10‚Äì11.

Located in the municipality of Calvi√†, it is 18 kilometres from the capital Palma.  History  It was believed that Santa Ponsa derived from a Roman villa called Santa Ponctia, but derives from the Arabic words Sanat Busa which means area of rush bushes. Santa Ponsa is where King James I of Aragon (Jaume in Catalan) landed on September 12, 1229 in his successful quest to conquer the island and take it from the Moors after more than 300 years of Muslim rule. Majorca became part of the Crown of Aragon following James's conquest, and was later annexed to the Monarchy of Spain. A cross at the sea entrance to the marina marks the spot where James landed. Every September there is a grand fiesta to commemorate the landing with a mock battle between the Moors and Christians on the beach. It is a two-week fiesta which incorporates a pop concert and firework display.  Tourism  The town is a popular holiday destination and attracts people from countries with colder climates such as Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Great Britain, especially from May to October. Some have bought villas and apartments in the hills on each side of the bay. In recent years, it has become a popular party destination among youths due to its great nightlife and its close distance to Magaluf, another party area.  Facilities  Santa Ponsa has two 18-hole (I, II) and one 9-hole golf courses (III). Santa Ponsa II has hosted a PGA European Tour event and is open only to club members. Its 18th green is in the shape of the island of Majorca within a pond, reached by a bridge. The Baleares International College, an English school founded in 1956, is located on the road to the nearby village of Magaluf. Santa Ponsa also has a private marina, Club N√°utico Santa Ponsa (Santa Ponsa Yacht Club), built in 1975 within the natural cove known as \\"Sa Caleta\\". The marina can accommodate up to 522 boats from 7m to 20m in length as well as offering dry dock services.

The ships were the , , , , , , and the . ATF East arrived in Kuwait on February 15, 2003 and quickly debarked their aircraft and ships then headed into the northern Kuwaiti desert. The Task force's equipment consisted of 81 aircraft, 46 Amphibious Assault Vehicles, 24 LAVs, 14 M1A1 Abrams tanks, 18 M198 howitzers, and 4 M9 ACEs. (however they only had 12 Abrams when the fighting started.) Operation Iraqi Freedom TFT crossed into Iraq on March 21, 2003 with the missions of securing Jalibah Airfield and then securing the 3 bridges over the Euphrates River at An Nasiriyah to allow the 1st Marine Division to continue its attack north. From March 23 to March 29, 2003, Task Force Tarawa was engaged in heavy fighting in and around the city of An Nasiriyah as they came in contact with Saddam Hussein‚Äôs Fedayeen and members of the Iraqi 11th Infantry Division. TFT lost 18 Marines in the fighting and were involved in a friendly fire incident in which two A-10 Warthog aircraft killed a number of Marines when they strafed their Amphibious Assault Vehicles with 30mm depleted uranium rounds and Maverick missiles. The A-10 pilots were not prosecuted. During this time the original task force grew with the additions of the 15th and 24th Marine Expeditionary Units. The Marines of TFT were the first U.S. unit to come in contact with the remnants of the 507th Maintenance Company after they were ambushed and later on were on standby to assist with the rescue of prisoner of war PFC Jessica Lynch. After leaving An Nasiriyah, the Task Force was tasked with securing the highways to the rear of the 1st Marine Division and on April 3, 2003 they secured the town of Ad Diwaniyah. They continued to move and on April 7, pushed into Al Amarah, securing the 10th Armoured Division HQ and the nearby Al Amarah airfield and finally ended the invasion outside of Baghdad after conducting security and stabilization operations in Al Kut on April 11.

He first became the Chief Minister in 1979, again in 1982, and again in 1991. He also served as the Union Agricultural Minister. Early life Bhajan Lal Bishnoi was born on 6 October 1930 in the Kotwali village of British India's Bahawalpur princely state, which is now in Pakistan. He married Jasmadevi, with whom he had two sons - Chander Mohan Bishnoi and Kuldip Bishnoi and a daughter, Roshni. A farmer by profession, Lal started his political career by becoming a village sarpanch and later the chairman of pamnchayaity samiti of Hisar. He join the Congress Party, and became the president of the Congress Mandal in the region. He was elected to the Haryana Assembly for the first time in 1968 after winning the mid-term polls in Adampur. Political career Lal was the chief minister of the Haryana state. His first term began on 28 June 1979. He was re-elected on May 23rd, 1982 serving until July 1985. His third term ran from 23 July 1991 to 11 May 1996. He also served as a union cabinet minister at the centre, holding the Agriculture and Environments and Forest portfolios during Rajiv Gandhi's administration. When Indira Gandhi came to power in January 1980, Lal was serving as CM of Janata Party in Haryana; he immediately defected with the majority of the party's MLAs to Congress and continued as CM. This act revealed him as an opportunist and as an exemplar of '‡§Ü‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ' culture in which opportunist politicians show no loyalty. The victory of the Indian National Congress in Haryana's 2005 elections caused a major rift in its state unit, as it opted to make Bhupinder Hooda, a Jat, the Chief Minister instead of Lal. In 2007, Lal officially announced he would form a new party, called the Haryana Janhit Congress. The key event that brought this about was the suspension of his son Kuldeep Bishnoi from the Indian National Congress, for criticizing the party's central leaders. 2009 Lok Sabha Elections Lal fought election from Hissar and defeated Sampat Singh, INLD leader by 6983 votes, Jai parkash of Congress came at third position in a high-profile battle.

He was born to Juan de la Cruz and Mamerta de la Cruz on July 26, 1844 in Bulacan. The family changed their name to Arellano in compliance with the Claveria decree of 1849. Arellano studied bookkeeping at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University). He also worked as an assistant clerk at the arsenal of the military's artillery corps. He married Marcelo H. del Pilar‚Äôs sister, Hilaria del Pillar, on April 22, 1877, after his first wife, Paula Rivera, died. Along with del Pilar, Arellano was an active Freemason. He also solicited funds for Filipino expatriates in Spain when del Pilar had to flee to Spain, because of allegedly subversive articles that appeared in the Filipino newspaper that del Pilar published, Diariong Tagalog (Tagalog Newspaper). In 1892, Arellano and other freemasons, like Andr√©s Bonifacio, joined La Liga Filipina, which was founded by Jos√© Rizal upon his return to the country. Arellano was elected the league's secretary, but Rizal was deported to Dapitan island in Mindanao a few days later. A few days after the establishment of the Liga, however, Rizal was arrested and detained at Fort Santiago. On July 7, 1892, Gov. Eulogio Despujol announced his immediate deportation to Dapitan. That same day, at the house of Deodato Arellano at 72 Azcarraga Street, Andres Bonifacio‚Äî a Liga member‚Äî gathered together Teodoro Plata, Valentin Diaz, Ladislao Diwa, Jose Dizon and Arellano himself to found an underground association, the Katipunan. Its main goal was to attain not mere reforms, but the country's separation from Spain and national independence. On July 7, 1892, when the government announced Rizal's deportation, Arellano and his compatriots founded the Katipunan. He was elected the first president of its Supreme Council. In a secret meeting called in October 1892, Arellano was also declared the first president of the association. As president, he endorsed the laws of the Katipunan formulated by Plata and Diwa. Arellano was very careful about hiring new members for there were too many spies. He did not last in that position, though. Several months later, in February 1893, he was replaced by Roman Basa as Katipunan head on the intervention of Bonifacio, who judged him an ineffectual leader. This was a big mistake for Bonifacio, as Arellano was very cautious upon picking members to join the Katipunan. Nevertheless, despite this personal setback, Arellano dutifully carried on with his work in the movement. While Bonifacio and other members were organizing popular councils in Manila, he himself was organizing provincial councils in Bulacan, thereby fulfilling one of Rizal's aims in founding the Liga. When the revolution broke out in August 1896, Arellano repaired to Bulacan and joined Gregorio del Pilar's brigade, becoming its commissary officer. He fought in the battles in Bulacan during the Philippine-American War, but he contracted tuberculosis in the course of the war and died of the disease while he and his fellow revolutionists were fighting in the Cordillera Mountains. His comrades buried him in the town cemetery of La Trinidad, Benguet. In popular culture * Portrayed by Julio Diaz in the 1997 film, Tirad Pass: The Story of Gen.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, the highest award in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during the war.

Stumme became commander of 2nd Light Division, which was formed on 10 November 1938. Stumme had achieved the rank of by the beginning of the war, and he commanded the 2nd Light Division in the Invasion of Poland in 1939. After the unit was converted into the 7th Panzer Division on 18 October 1939, he relinquished command of the 7th Panzer Division to Erwin Rommel in 1940, and was appointed as commander of XL. on 15 February 1940, which became XL Corps (motorized) in September 1940. He led this corps in the 1940 Ardennes campaign, being promoted to on 1 June 1940.

His two divisions drove west separately into Yugoslavia and then wheeled south, meeting at Monastir on 9 April. He then participated in the invasion of Greece. He was promoted to . In Operation Barbarossa Stumme served under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock. Stumme commanded the capture of Mozhaisk. He then participated in (Case Blue) to lead the advance of the 6th Army with his renamed XL. . In June 1942 some German plans were captured by Soviet forces. Hitler blamed Stumme and ordered that he be court-martialled. He was relieved of command on 21 July 1942, was found guilty and was sentenced to five years imprisonment but Bock secured his release. Ulrich von Hassell called it a case of \\"the grotesque game of tin soldiers which Hitler plays with the generals\\" in his diary and commented: \\"Stumme, commanding general of a tank corps, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment because [of the actions of a divisional staff officer]. He was immediately pardoned, with G√∂ring promising him a new command and is now being sent to Africa as a substitute for Rommel.

Battle of El Alamein and death Stumme \\"faithfully followed the plan left by Rommel\\" for responding to the expected attack. His letters to his superiors indicate he was not optimistic and agreed with Rommel that the only real prospect of success lay in keeping the enemy wrongfooted with attacks, for which he did not have the resources. Just over a month after his arrival the British began their attack on 23 October with a massive bombardment. Stumme prohibited the use of German artillery ammunition to bombard the British forward assembly areas, where the troops were vulnerable, preferring to keep his limited resources in reserve. Reinhard Stumpf called this \\"a grave mistake that enabled the British to form up for the attack in relative peace\\".Stumpf, Reinhard, \\"The War in the Mediterranean Area 1942‚Äì43\\" in Germany and the Second World War: Volume 6: The Global War, Oxford University Press, 2001. Unlike Rommel, Stumme travelled without the protection of an escort and radio car. On 24 October Stumme and Colonel Andreas B√ºchting, his chief signals officer, drove to the front to review the situation. On the way to the command post, the car came into the open and was attacked. B√ºchting was killed by a shot in the head. Stumme jumped out of the car and apparently was holding onto the side while the driver drove out of range. He was found dead along the track the next day, with no wound that could be seen. He was known to have high blood pressure and it was thought he had died of a heart attack.Young, Desmond (1950). Rommel The Desert Fox. New York: Harper & RowYoung, p. 250 He was replaced as commander of with the return of Rommel, while the was commanded by Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma.

Mitcham, Rommel's Lieutenants: The Men who Served the Desert Fox, France, 1940, Issue 7, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p. 27. One of his officers, Friedrich von Stauffenberg, said that Stumme created a \\"congenial\\" atmosphere while maintaining a \\"crack, well-officered division\\". According to Mark M. Boatner, Rommel had suggested that Heinz Guderian should replace him in North Africa but Guderian was out of favor and his request was refused. Stumme was given the command instead and Rommel had confidence in him as a commander.

At the time of its closing, it was the second-oldest working cinema in Glasgow, Scotland. History The ABC Toledo cinema was opened on 2 October 1933. It was designed by William Beresford Inglis, who also built other cinemas in Glasgow. He also designed the Beresford Hotel, notable for its very cinema-like design, which is now the Beresford Flats. The design is a rare Scottish example of an atmospheric cinema; there were only ever around five cinemas built in this style in Scotland (others include the Campbeltown Picture House and Edinburgh's New Victoria. The Toledo interior was designed to give a feel that the patron was sitting outside in a Spanish courtyard, surrounded on either side by small false buildings and painted landscapes, with a ceiling above painted blue to feel like sky. Even more rarely, the exterior of the building was also in a \\"Spanish/American\\" style. Originally seating 1,598 people in a single auditorium, the cinema was subdivided into three auditoria in 1982, when the interior of the building was refurbished. The new Cinema Screen 1 consisted of the original circle area, with a brand new screen, which now sat an extra 482. Cinema Screen 2 had 208 seats in the old front stalls and used the original proscenium opening. Cinema Screen 3 had 90 seats in the old rear stalls. Closure Eventually, the time of the cinema came to an end. Glasgow City Council's Development and Regeneration Director, Rodger McConnell, said \\"the fabric of the 1933 building has deteriorated so badly it would require a substantial upgrade and repairs\\". Indeed, the building was so run-down inside at time of closure, the heating system had been broken for over a month. During that time, the management had hung signs all over the public areas of the building stating that, since they would be closing soon anyway, there were no plans to fix the heating. Fewer people went to the cinema because it meant having to wrap up inside the cold screens. A proposal was put forward by Cala Homes to use the site to build upmarket flats. The planned development angered local residents, who insisted the building should be kept as a cinema. The local MP asked for a decision on the future of the B-listed building to be deferred for a year to allow him to try to find an alternative cinema operator. Unfortunately, he later admitted that a new operator for the venue could not be found. He said: \\"I wrote to all the major chains, as well as the independent companies I could identify. However, they all said the same thing... that it was just not worthwhile.\\" Since no firms showed any interest in taking over the venue, the residents of Muirend had to accept the new use of the building. The MP made the following statement: \\"I am disappointed because, while I am not averse to having flats in that area, there is virtually nothing there for young people to do. And although I am reluctant to see the cinema disappear, it is fairly clear now that I am not going to make any headway. The new building will be very impressive - but that is not much consolation to people in the community who have nothing to do in their area.\\" Cala Homes said that they intended to retain and restore the Art Deco frontage of the cinema, which would be extended onto the rear car park, since it was a listed building. They also planned a new internal foyer to be created which would incorporate elements from the original cinema. Urns that decorated the interior would be re-used, with lighting features and tiles being incorporated along with some of the scenes painted onto panels in the building. On 21 October 2001, the cinema closed down for good. The cinema owners, Odeon, ultimately blamed the opening of multi-screen cinemas elsewhere in the city for the fall of the old venue. On its final night, the cinema marquee read: :TOLEDO :1933 TO 2001 :THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT Present The cinema building, with the exception of the facade, was demolished, and new flats were constructed behind that. Additional windows were added to the frontage. The entrance foyer to the flats feature reproductions of some of the decorative features rescued from the auditorium, and some of the tiles and light- fittings. It remains a category B listed building.

It was invented by Japanese-American businesswoman and activist Frances Hashimoto. Description Mochi ice cream is a small, round confection consisting of a soft, pounded sticky rice dumpling (mochi) formed around an ice cream filling. The ice cream flavors the confection while the mochi adds sweetness and texture. The traditional ice cream flavors used are vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. Other flavors, such as Kona coffee, plum wine, green tea, and red bean, are also widely used. Mochi can also be flavored as a complement to the ice cream filling. When making mochi, it is dusted with either potato or cornstarch to keep it from sticking while being formed and handled. History Japanese daifuku and manj≈´ are the predecessors to mochi ice cream, commonly featuring adzuki bean filling. Due to the temperature and consistency of mochi and ice cream, both components must be modified. This is to achieve the right viscosity that will remain constant regardless of changes in temperature.Eto, Masa, Pursuit of Innovative Food, Masa's Message, A&D; Company Ltd., March 2004.

Tokyo, 1981. Frances Hashimoto, the former president and CEO of Mikawaya, is credited as the inventor of mochi ice cream. Hashimoto's husband, Joel Friedman, conceived the idea of taking small orbs of ice cream and wrapping them in a Japanese traditional mochi rice cake. Frances Hashimoto expanded on her husband's idea, inventing the fusion dessert now popular in the United States and elsewhere. Hashimoto introduced seven flavors in the mochi product line. Mikawaya began production of mochi ice cream in the United States in 1993.Mainstream America Embraces Mochi Ice Cream, sushiandtofu.com, All Japan News, December, 2001.

Research and development took over a decade to evolve into the mass production form used today, due to the complex interactions of the ingredients. Trial and error was used in order to successfully pull the delicate mochi dough over the ice cream without leaving a sodden mess. Friedman explained that in order to conduct production of the ice cream, experts ranging from construction to microbiology were brought in to perfect the state-of-the-art production building. Mikawaya debuted their Mochi Ice Cream in Hawaii in 1994. The frozen treat was so popular, it captured 15% of the novelty frozen treat market during its first four months.

The University has a student body of some 850 coming from over 40 countries. Forty-seven full-time and part-time faculty and 200 associate professors (People) provide individualized instruction. History In 1935 three private music schools were merged into the Robert Schumann Conservatorium, named after the composer Robert Schumann, who lived in D√ºsseldorf for some years. In 1972 the state of North Rhine- Westphalia became the body responsible for the music college. It became part of the public college for music in the Rhineland. In 1987 it became an independent college and was given its current name. Studies The programs of study offered by the Robert Schumann Hochschule cover the entire range of music professions. Music, the largest of the programs of study, focuses on performance: Anyone who studies piano or violin, guitar or clarinet, composition or voice in D√ºsseldorf learns to perform together with other musicians in orchestras and ensembles. That is why degree programs include many performance opportunities: The University Orchestra regularly performs at D√ºsseldorf's Tonhalle symphony hall and, in close collaboration with the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, opera voice majors show off their talent in an annual staged opera production. The Musikvermittlung (Music Promotion) degree program includes majors in Music Education, Conducting, Ear Training, and Church Music. Social and pedagogical competency play an important role in all majors. For instance, a church music major not only has to play the organ but also be able to lead a choir and to make music with children and young people. Work with laypeople is also the goal of the music education degree program, where education majors are prepared for a career as teachers in music schools. Despite the considerable amount of work on performance, theory is not neglected. The musicology faculty carry on research in historical and systematic musicology. They organize scientific symposia and publish a series of scholarly papers. A special role is played by the Institute of Music and Media which concentrates on the practical training of students for careers in media and the music industry. Majors such as Media Composition, Music and Media, Media Dramaturgy and Management provide excellent training for work in these specialized fields. The program of studies Audio and Video, offered in cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences D√ºsseldorf, combines studies in engineering with formal conservatory training. D√ºsseldorf is the only university to offer this major in Germany. Cooperation with the German Armed Forces Music Training corps, which began in 1976, is also unique. Every professional musician in Germany's armed forces has a degree from the Robert Schumann Hochschule. The Bundeswehr prepares soldiers for the entrance exam and later employs the trained musicians.

Song The song opens with the refrain I'm on the drug that killed River Phoenix and, as the song continues, talking about a wide variety of celebrities who died due to some sort of excess. As the song progresses, it becomes clear that the addiction is not about actually doing these things himself; rather, his addiction is vicariously following celebrities and their excesses and premature deaths. As with a number of TISM songs, it is a comment on the fairly vapid state of popular culture.

Locale The townland runs down to the coast, and is bounded by the Flurry River, running south and reaching the sea at its edge, and a late tributary running east. History The dolmen at Proleek The name Ballymascanlan means \\"town of the son of Scanlan\\": a reference to Scanlan, son of Fingin, chief of the U√≠ M√©ith, who died in 672. The U√≠ M√©ith were rulers in the kingdom of Oriel until the Anglo-Norman period. An U√≠ M√©ith is credited with having defeated the Danes in Dundalk Bay in 833. The village of Omeath on Carlingford Lough also takes name from this group. In 1185, during the Norman- English period, the district of Ballymascanlan as far north as Carrickarnon was donated by Hugh de Lacy to the Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont. Following the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII the lordship of Ballymascanlan was granted to Sir Edward Moore, ancestor of the Marquess of Drogheda. Sir Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore inherited the title and estates in 1600 and was a friend of Hugh O'Neill, the Earl of Tyrone, who was a frequent visitor to Mellifont and Ballymascanlon. The associated 'Lands of Ballymascanlon' were transferred from Armagh to Louth circa 1630. It remained in the hands of the Moore family until the middle of the 18th century. In 1688 the brothers Malcolm and Archibald Mcneill, officers of William III landed in Dundalk and defeated the Celtic Scanlons in the Battle of Ballymascanlon.

He was made an honorary canon of the cathedral chapter of Coutances in 1917. On 30 January 1918, Grente was appointed Bishop of Le Mans by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 17 April from Cardinal Louis-Ernest Dubois, with Bishops Claude Bardel and Joseph Gu√©rard serving as co- consecrators. He was given the title of Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on 18 January 1933, and personal title of \\"Archbishop\\" in March 1943. During World War II, Grente worked in the French resistance movement. Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of S. Bernardo alle Terme in the consistory of 12 January 1953. Despite speculation that his poor health would prevent him from participating, Grente was one of the cardinal electors in the 1958 papal conclave, which selected Pope John XXIII . A member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, he was in close correspondence with Charles de Gaulle as well. It was in a letter to Grente that de Gaulle made his famous distinction between la France chr√©tienne and la r√©publique l√§ique. The Cardinal died in Le Mans, on his 87th birthday, and was buried in the Cathedral of Le Mans (his heart however was interred in the church at Percy). He had served as the ordinary of that city for over forty years. Academically eminent but pretentious in manner, Grente was satirized by his clergy. He was subject to an attack by the Canard Encha√Æn√© on his ownership of brothels near the cathedral purchased unsuccessfully (given opposition by civil and military authorities) in view of their closure, renewed by Jean Egen in 1973. In 1998, Grente was the posthumous object of an attempt at character assassination by Christian Gury.

In a room, the kamiza is the seat or position that is most comfortable, usually furthest from the door ‚Äì because this is warmest, and was safest from attack back in the feudal period. In a traditional washitsu room it would often be a zabuton placed so the person sitting there has his back to the tokonoma; the kamiza is the spot closest to the tokonoma or simply farthest from the door in a room lacking a tokonoma. In a Western-style room it would be a comfortable armchair or sofa, or the head of a table. The term is general, and does not only apply to Japanese culture. Choosing a seat When entering a room in Japan on a formal occasion, participants are expected to assume the correct seating position, and to leave the kamiza free for the most important person present, either a guest of honor or the person of highest rank. However, if one humbly sits somewhere indicative of lower status and is then encouraged by the host to move to the kamiza, it is acceptable to do so. The best seats in a car in descending order of rank are: directly behind the driver, behind the front passenger, in the middle of the back seat, front passenger seat, driver.

In legal theory, decisionism had a notable proponent in the German law scholar Carl Schmitt.Oliver W. Lembcke, Claudia Ritzi, Gary S.

He was a with the St. George Dragons during their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He was a representative in the Australian national team in 1957 and from 1959-1960 earning five Test caps plus three World Cup appearances. He is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century. Century's Top 100 Players Background Clay grew up in the inner Sydney suburb of St Peters. He played schoolboy football for Newtown Technical School and captained a New South Wales Schoolboys side. He began losing his hair as a teenager and early in his football career became known as 'Poppa'. Professional playing career=Newtown Clay was graded by Newtown in 1953 aged 18. He played in the club's losing Grand final teams of 1954 and 1955, learning the ropes against the powerful early 1950s South Sydney Rabbitohs sides. St. George & Representative career After Clay spent the 1956 country season with Griffith, Frank Facer offered him a contract with St George as a lock forward from 1957. He made his State and International debut in 1957 and played a major role in Australia's success in the 1957 World Cup. When Johnny Raper joined the club in 1959 Clay moved to five-eighth at which position he enjoyed most success. Outside the game Clay was a dour, cautious man, highly principled and loyal. On field Clay ran stampeding, battering charges like an extra forward and would then set the wider backs in motion with precise passes. His flashier outside backs Reg Gasnier and Johnny King benefitted from the opposition defence Clay would absorb on their behalf. In turn he was known for his own punishing defence using a shuddering ball-and- all style of crash tackle. In 1959 Clay played in the New South Wales loss to Queensland that attracted 35,261 spectators, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817. He went on the 1959 Kangaroo Tour of Britain and France appearing in five test matches and sixteen minor Tour games. Clay is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 332.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54 He alternated with Johnny Raper between and during the tour. Clay played 200 club games (183 1st grade) for the St. George Dragons between 1957 and 1967 and played in eight of the famous Grand Final victories. He missed the 1962 and 1963 Grand Finals with broken arm injuries. A knee cartilage operation in 1967 meant that he played his last games at less than 100% fitness. His 200th and last career game was the 1967 final against the Kevin Ryan led Canterbury Bulldogs where the aging Dragons outfit went down 12-11 and the record breaking premiership run ended.

Doomsword's lyrics are concerned with epic themes such as ancient and medieval history, fantasy literature, and European mythology. History=1014AD and early days Founded in 1997 by Deathmaster (previously a member of the metal band Agarthi), DoomSword were born as a studio project aimed at playing epic / medieval influenced epic metal in the way of Warlord. The original members of the band, Deathmaster and Guardian Angel, were already working together on an ancient music project called 1014AD with strong medieval influences, and after a short hiatus they re-arranged the 1014AD material into proper heavy metal songs, and released them as a demo called \\"Sacred Metal\\" the same year. The original line-up saw Deathmaster taking care of guitars and vocals and Guardian Angel taking care of drums and the second guitar. A session bass guitar player was used for the demo, after which bass player Dark Omen joined the band. Debut album period (1997‚Äì1999) In 1998 DoomSword were signed by Italian label Underground Symphony and released their first same-titled album in 1999. New singer Nightcomer joined the band (Deathmaster only took care of guitars). After the release of the album the band almost split up, with Nightcomer and Guardian Angel leaving DoomSword. Dragonheart period (2001‚Äìpresent) In 2001, Deathmaster resumed his original role of singer in the band, recruited new elements and resurrected the band after a 2-year hiatus, and with this new line up (The Forger and Guardian Angel II at guitars, Grom at drums) the band signed for Dragonheart records. DoomSword went on to publish 4 albums with Dragonheart, namely the purely epic Resound the Horn, the Viking-themed Let Battle Commence, the classic metal with Irish influences My Name Will Live On and the darker and more introspective The Eternal Battle (released on February 25, 2011). In 2002 DoomSword broke their live \\"silence\\" by playing a gig with Manilla Road in Porto D'Ascoli, Italy, and subsequently taking part to important underground metal festivals such as the Keep It True, Bang Your Head, Up The Hammers, Headbangers Open Air etc. Pseudonyms As mentioned on their official site, DoomSword adopted pseudonyms in 1997 to reinforce their bond with their main influence, US metal band Warlord.

It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Devnya Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 8,383 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - towns in 2009 Devnya town hall It lies at the western shore of Lake Beloslav in the northeastern end of the Devnya Valley and along the southern slopes of the Dobruja Plateau, in the close proximity to the Black Sea. Two rivers, Devnya and Provadiya, empty into the lake nearby. The landscape is mostly karst with 30 karst springs with a debit of 3700 litres per second used for water supply for Devnya, Varna and the local industries. One of the largest springs, feeding a pool, is open for visitors. Along the river mouths there are extensive wetlands once rich in fish and crabs but now polluted by industrial waste. Local landmarks include Roman remains of ancient Marcianopolis, including an amphitheatre and the Mosaics Museum, featuring some exquisite Roman mosaics in situ, and Pobiti Kamani (\\"stone forest\\"), a rock phenomenon to the east. History=Ancient history A mosaic featuring an image of the gorgon Medusa in Devnya's Mosaics Museum Devnya lies at the site of the Ancient Roman and Early Byzantine city of Marcianopolis (ŒúŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøœçœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ) founded by Roman Emperor Trajan after the Second Dacian War, which ended in 106. The city was named after Trajan's sister, Ulpia Marciana. An important strategic centre, the city was part of Roman Thrace until 187-193, and then belonged to Moesia inferior. Marcianopolis's prosperity under the Severan Dynasty was ended by a Gothic raid in 248-249 and subsequent barbarian invasions from the north. Under Emperor Diocletian Marcianopolis became the centre of the province Moesia Secunda of the Diocese of Thrace, and was rebuilt thoroughly in the late 3rd and early 4th century. It grew in importance at the expense of neighbouring Odessos (Varna) in the 4th century. The city was an important episcopal centre and a basilica from the period was excavated in the 20th century. During Emperor Valens' conflict with the Goths (366-369), Marcianopolis was a temporary capital of the empire and the largest city of Thrace according to a source from the period. The House of Antiope, a Late Roman villa decorated with several beautiful floor mosaics has been excavated and is on public display. The villa was constructed in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. Despite the regular barbarian attacks, Marcianopolis remained an important centre until an Avar raid finally destroyed it in 614-615, although it still continued to be mentioned in maps until much later. Middle Ages, Ottoman rule and liberated Bulgaria As the Slavs settled in the Balkans in the 7th century they called the ruins of the ancient city Devina, from Proto-Indo-European *dhew-(i)na or *dhew-eina (\\"spring, source, stream, current\\") through Thracian, but associated with Slavic deva (\\"virgin\\"). A small Bulgar fortress existed at the place during the Middle Ages, possibly built under Omurtag in the 9th century and extended to the north in the 10th or 11th century. A large 9th-century Bulgar mass grave has been excavated. After the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans the fortress was destroyed and abandoned, with the settlement moved to the west. A village by the name of Devne is mentioned in a tax register from 1573, with other forms of the name also attested by foreign and Bulgarian travellers in the 16th and 17th century, sometimes used to designate the river. After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule the village was called Devne until 1934, when it was substituted by the form Devnya. The lower river Devnya was a traditional industrial centre since Ottoman times with numerous watermills serving much or riverless Southern Dobruja, a breadbasket area. On 27 August 1969 the town of Devnya was formed through the merger of the villages Devnya, Reka Devnya and Povelyanovo. Economy Devnya is part of the Varna-Devnya Industrial Complex and a number of important heavy industry facilities are located in or near the town, making it a chemical industry centre of national importance. Among these are: * Solvay Sodi AD ‚Äî sodium bicarbonate, dense and light soda ash, largest soda plant in Europe (2007); part of the Solvay Group * Agropolychim AD ‚Äî nitrogen, phosphate and compound fertilizers, exports to Europe (49% of output), the Americas (11%), Asia (9%), and supplying more than 50% of the Bulgarian market, member of the Acid & Fertilizers LLC (joint venture of Harland Investments Ltd., United States, with 99%, and Belgium's Cumerio with 1% share). * Polimeri AD ‚Äî liquid chlorine, dichloroethane, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), hydrochloric acid, chlorine lime, carbide, and emulsion polyvinyl chloride; AKB Fores portfolio company * Devnya Cement ‚Äî cement; part of Italcementi * Devnya Sugar Plant (Litex Sugar) ‚Äî refined sugar; part of Litex Commerce JSC * Deven AD ‚Äî thermal power plant (steam station owned by Solvay Sodi) * Provadsol AD ‚Äî brine (near Provadiya; owned by Solvay Sodi) * Devnya Limestone AD (owned by Solvay Sodi) Devnya is also a major transportation hub with the inland Port of Varna West and two railway stations.

A giant of a man, he was a second-row forward with the St. George Dragons during the first 10 of their 11-year consecutive premiership-winning run from 1956 to 1966. Named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century, he was a representative in the Australian national team from 1954 to 1960 earning 14 Test and 2 World Cup cups. In 2018, he was inducted as the 13th Immortal of Australian Rugby League. Club career and player-coach His first junior football was played for Willoughby Roos in the North Sydney District and attending high school at Crows Nest. After his family relocated to the St George-Sutherland region, Provan played with the Sutherland Woronora JuniorsHaddan p X and the Sutherland Gravediggers.Apter The Coaches: The Men Who Changed Rugby League He was graded by St George in 1950 after being turned down by Easts the prior year. Having won the premiership in 1949, St George slipped to a fifth-place finish in 1950 but things were falling into place that year with the move to Jubilee Oval, Frank Facer's move from player to club selector and committeeman and Provan's arrival. Provan featured in their 1951 campaign ‚Äì a loss in the final against Manly for 3rd place; a 2nd place in the minor premiership in 1952 and a semi-final exit to North Sydney; and then the 1953 Dragons side that lost the 1953 final to South Sydney. St George and Souths would battle head-to-head on many more occasions in Provan's illustrious career. Provan's strength at second row in attack and in defence, in partnership with Harry Melville, Harry Bath and Monty Porter laid the foundations in those first years of their glory run. After the retirement of Ken Kearney in 1962 from the playing arena, and given the Dragons administrators' preference for a player-coach, Provan took over as captain- coach and the club's dominant run continued. A fitness fanatic himself, Provan continued Kearney's punishing and successful training routine giving Dragon sides of the period confidence that they could edge out their fatiguing opposition in the final twenty minutes of each encounter. Provan set high standards for himself and his players directing a training mix that included sandhill running at Cronulla; lap running at Kogarah and touch-football. He was content to maintain a certain distance from the team and saw the captain- coach role as a tough, solitary role requiring him to stand slightly apart from his players. A teetotaler later in life, Provan occasionally shared a drink in the shed after a match but he would rarely finish the first beer. Provan holds the club record of 284 games for St George achieved between 1951 and 1965. He played in the first ten of their record run of 11 premiership victories ‚Äì as captain-coach for four ‚Äì and made 30 finals appearances for the club over fifteen consecutive seasons. His last game before retirement was a victory in the 1965 Grand Final where the Dragons beat the Rabbitohs 12‚Äì8 in front 78,065 which stands as the Sydney Cricket Ground's all-time attendance record.Fitting Farewells, The Sydney Morning Herald, 6 January 2007. Painting of Norm Provan at St.George League Club,Kogarah. Representative career In 1954 Provan first represented for New South Wales and that same year made his Test debut, playing in all three matches of the 1954 series against the visiting Great Britain side commencing a representative second-row partnership with Wests Kel O'Shea that would continue for a number of years. Provan was selected for the 1956 Kangaroo tour. Due to injury he missed the Ashes series against Great Britain but appeared in three Tests against France at the end of the tour. He appeared in 15 other minor matches on the tour. In 1957 he was a member of Australia's victorious World Cup squad. He continued his Test pairing with Kel O'Shea in all three games of the domestic 1958 series against Great Britain and in 1959 featured in all three Tests against the visiting Kiwis. Also in 1959 Provan played in the New South Wales loss to Queensland that attracted 35,261 spectators, smashing Brisbane's previous record for an interstate match of 22,817. Family priorities and business commitments caused him to cut short his representative career starting with the 1959 Kangaroo tour and he made his final national appearance in the 1960 series against France. Provan is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 310.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54 Non-playing coach After retiring from playing he went on to coach. He was a non-playing coach for St George for a season in 1968 and with the Parramatta Eels for a single season in 1975. Under his stewardship the Eels won the Pre-Season Cup (Wills Cup), the club's maiden first-grade title, and fell one game short of making their first Grand Final appearance. He had two seasons coaching the Cronulla Sharks in 1978 and 1979 taking them to a loss to Manly. Records He played in finals football in for fifteen consecutive seasons from 1951 to 1965. Along with Brian Clay, his appearance in ten consecutive Grand Finals is an Australian rugby league record, however Norm Provan played in 11 Grand Finals , his first being in 1953 when St.George losing to South Sydney. His victory statistic of ten consecutive first-grade premierships is a world record in rugby league and a world class achievement in any top-grade team sport. In the 1962 Grand Final at the age of 29 years and 271 days, he became the youngest person to ever coach a side to premiership victory in a Grand Final, a record that still stands. His brother Peter Provan played alongside him at St George in the 1958 and 1959 Grand Finals and later captained the Balmain Tigers to their 1969 Grand Final victory. Together Norm and Peter are the only brothers to have led differing Australian first-grade rugby league sides to premiership victories. Accolades Provan was awarded Life Membership of the St. George Dragons club in 1963. The Gladiators ‚Äì Provan is the subject of one of the most memorable sporting photographic images ever captured in Australia. The 1963 NSW Rugby League Premiership grand final between long term rivals Western Suburbs and St George was played in a torrential downpour on Saturday, 24 August. This, combined with the fact that the centre cricket pitch area of Sydney Cricket Ground was notoriously muddy in such conditions, ensured that the players were not only saturated but also caked in mud from head to toe. At the conclusion of the hard-fought match, which was won by St George, the captains of the two teams, the very tall Norm Provan and more diminutive Arthur Summons, embraced in appreciation of each other's stoic efforts. The moment was captured by a newspaper photographer, John O'Gready, and published in the following day's Sun Herald. Subsequently, the image won several awards, becoming known as The Gladiators. This image was the inspiration for the current premiership trophy's bronze statue. In 2004 Provan was admitted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame In 2007 he was selected by a panel of experts at second-row in an Australian 'Team of the 50s'. In February 2008, Provan was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Provan went on to be named in the second-row in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In 2008 New South Wales announced their rugby league team of the century also and Provan was again named at second-row. In October 2015, Provan was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. In 2018 Provan was inducted as a Rugby League Immortal along with Mal Meninga and pre-WWII greats Dave Brown, Frank Burge and Dally Messenger.

It had 1,570 students aged 11 to 18 of both sexes and all ability levels of which 284 were in the sixth form in 2013. It is currently a Church of England voluntary controlled school. The historic school motto is \\"Recta Certa\\" which means 'straight and true'. It became an Academy in August 2011. An Ofsted inspection in 2007 judged the school to be 'outstanding', while the next Ofsted inspection in 2010 rated the school as 'good', with outstanding elements. A further Ofsted inspection was conducted throughout October 2013 again giving a rating of Good. The school is a Specialist Science College and in 2006 the Princess Royal opened a new science centre. History of The Blue School The pedestrian entrance The school was founded in 1641 as one of the first free schools in the country. The name Blue comes from the early uniforms which were blue in colour. Some visitors to Wells have expected the school itself to be blue in colour, but this is not the case. In 1654, Margaret, widow of Ezekiel Barkham of Wells, purchased a farm in Yenston, to endow a school in Wells. The Blue School retained the farm for nearly 350 years until it was sold in 1990 and 1992.'Henstridge,' A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 7: Bruton, Horethorne and Norton Ferris Hundreds (1999), pp. 108‚Äì19, at www.british-history.ac.uk The income from the endowment was to be used for paying a schoolmaster's salary of ¬£20-0-0 pa. and the residue for apprenticing the boys when they could 'read, write and cast accounts'. The school owned a number of properties in the area scattered over several parishes. Other schools were united with The Blue School foundation, including Hodge's Charity School. As befitting a Church of England foundation, the Blue School has a Chaplain, plus partnership links with a school in Zambia. The Blue School Council The Blue School was the first pilot for an innovative approach to school councils based on self-selection called Learning to Lead The School Community Council received praise in the School's 2007 Ofsted report. The school council runs on principles of self-election, and has over 250 members, including students of all ages and staff. Meetings are conducted during lunch times and projects include: keeping chickens, fundraising for many charities, running a garden and many more. In 2010 two visionaries launched an ambitious project, backed by Lottery Funding, to set up a School- based radio station. The project, run by students, produced a series of podcasts. In mid 2013, after relocating, the \\"Blue Lounge Radio\\" prepared to begin to broadcast again pending the arrival of new hardware. A charity for the benefit of the poor of St. Cuthbert's parish was established in 1675 by the will of Adrian Hickes of London, although lands in Wells and Glastonbury to endow the charity were not purchased until 1701. In 1713 a voluntary subscription school was established in Wells for boys and girls and a schoolroom was built for this purpose by Philip Hodges. He also purchased land in Glastonbury St. John, the income from which was to be used to pay the master's salary. In 1715 it was proposed that a charity established by Barkham be amalgamated with that deriving from the Hickes bequest. Philip Hodges' will of 1723 empowered the master of the subscription school established in 1713 to teach also the pupils of Barkham's charity school. Lands in Lympsham, East Pennard and Pylle were purchased in 1732 and an estate at Norwood Park, Glastonbury in 1735. In 1740 the estates of all three charities were transferred to new trustees. Some property in Frome was acquired between 1732 and 1764 and in Queen Camel between 1730 and 1739. The charities all became part of the Blue School foundation. The current school is made up of two main blocks, Milton and Kennion which are named after the roads which they are closest to. They were built as separate schools in the 1950s and 1960s respectively but they were then joined in the 1970s. The next major change was the sports centre in 1999 which added large sporting facilities for the use of the school and the general public. Then in 2005, the school built a brand new science block. More recently, in 2013, a block (named Barkham) was built, on the disused swimming pool, specifically for sixth form lessons. Alumni *Speleologist and founder of Wells Museum Herbert E.

It was initially based at Roehampton House specialising in the care of amputees and soon became a world-renowned limb fitting and amputee rehabilitation centre. A fully equipped hospital was built on site in the early 1920s, a plastic and oral surgery unit developed by Sir Harold Gillies moved onto the site in 1925 and a Tropical Diseases unit was established for former prisoners of war in 1945. The hospital joined the National Health Service late (in 1961). Following discovery of significant asbestos, the original site was left in 1983. The Douglas Bader Unit, an established international centre of excellence in the field of research and development of rehabilitation techniques, was opened on the site by Diana, Princess of Wales in 1993. A major rebuilding programme was procured under the Private Finance Initiative in 2004. The new facilities, designed by P. M. Devereux and built by Bovis Lend Lease at a cost of ¬£55 million, were officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester on 1 November 2006.

Novel series Chuck Bass is introduced by author Cecily von Ziegesar in her Gossip Girl series of teen novels, the first of which was published in 2002. In the novels, Chuck is a relatively minor character, and has a series of flings with male and female characters across the course of the series. He got his nickname, Chuck Bass, from his signature chuckle in a bass tone, which often sounds like a raspy whisper. Chuck's role is initially that of an antagonist to the main characters. Chuck resides with his family at the Plaza Hotel on the Upper East Side and attends school at the Riverside Preparatory School for Boys on the Upper East Side, along with scholarship student Dan Humphrey. Chuck is largely friendless, but is tolerated by the others because of his family's enormous wealth. He is described as having flamboyant fashion sense, with a penchant for scarves, and has a pet monkey named Sweetie. Lazy, and vain, Chuck's only interests are sex and money, and he is frequently chided by his father for lacking ambition and performing poorly in school. Following flings with numerous females and males, his only serious relationship comes near the end of the series, when he begins dating Blair Waldorf, a self-obsessed, luxury loving teenager. In the twelfth book in the series, Gossip Girl: It Had To Be You (2007), Chuck is rejected from colleges because of poor grades and is sent to military school by his father. When next mentioned in Gossip Girl spin-off, The Carlyles (2008), it is stated that Chuck never showed up to military school, and his whereabouts thereafter are unknown. In the thirteenth Gossip Girl novel, I Will Always Love You (2009), it is revealed that Chuck went off to school in California and returned a changed man, and to have dated main character Blair Waldorf in Oxford, England for a year. TV series Constance Billiard School is an exaggerated version of Gossip Girl author Cecily von Ziegesar's alma mater, the Nightingale-Bamford School. It was revealed in preparation for the 2007 TV series debut, Josh Schwartz hired recent graduates of Ziegesar's alma mater to retool several characters.Walper, Simone (September 2, 2010) \\"Sp√©cial trading, entrez sur le Forex avec l'euro/dollar.\\" MoneyWeek. Numerous 096. Chuck Bass was then reconfigured as a more central character, an antiheroic playboy whose on-off relationship with Blair Waldorf serves as one of the show's major ongoing storylines. Chuck is the resident \\"bad boy\\" of the Upper East Side, and like Blair, is both vengeful and manipulative; the two often scheme elaborate plans together. As the show progresses, Chuck develops a softer side, specifically towards Blair, his chief love interest, and Lily, Eric, and Serena, his adoptive mother, brother, and sister. Season 1 Chuck grew up on the Upper East Side with his three best friends and fellow elites Nate Archibald, Blair Waldorf, and future- stepsister Serena van der Woodsen. His father is Bart Bass, a self-made billionaire, which is irregular, compared to the Bass' old money friends. Chuck is often described as the \\"bad boy of his circle.\\" Chuck is a playboy and womanizer who sees women as recreational tools. Chuck frequently skips class and smokes cannabis. In the pilot episode, Chuck attempts to rape both Serena and Jenny Humphrey. When speaking about Serena in the pilot episode, Chuck says, \\"Serena looked effin' hot last night. There's something wrong with that level of perfection. It needs to be violated.\\" With time, he attenuates his behaviors as a sexual predator and becomes more of a manipulating womanizer. However, his lecherous attitude continues as he makes multiple advances on his step-sister at the time, Serena. In episode seven, \\"Victor/Victrola\\", Chuck purchases a burlesque club, Victrola. After Nate and Blair break up, Blair visits Chuck at Victrola where she ends up performing on stage. She later loses her virginity to him in the back of his limousine. Though she tries to deny the encounter, Chuck buys a necklace for her and admits that he feels \\"butterflies\\" in her presence, leading to a clandestine sexual relationship. Despite this, Nate and Blair rekindle their relationship, leading to a jealous Chuck revealing to the anonymous \\"Gossip Girl\\" that Blair and Chuck had a sexual relationship. This leads Chuck to have a temporary rift with both Blair and Nate. As Bart Bass and Lily van der Woodsen's relationship progresses, they decide to move their families in together. Chuck and Eric van der Woodsen, Lily's son and Serena's younger brother, become especially close. When Serena begins receiving mysterious packages (pornography in the mail, alcohol delivered to her at school), she automatically blames Chuck. Given the creepy remarks Chuck has made about \\"bathing together\\" and \\"turning that onepiece into a no-piece.\\" Serena is not to blame. Bart subsequently forces Chuck to move out of the family home. Serena discovers that the culprit was actually Georgina Sparks, a past classmate of both Serena and Chuck. It is later revealed that Chuck lost his virginity to Georgina in the sixth grade. Chuck and Blair join together to prevent Georgina from further harming and embarrassing Serena. This process rekindles their bond, and they succeed in getting rid of Georgina. At Bart and Lily's wedding at the end of Season 1, Chuck apologizes and confesses to Nate that he was in love with Blair. During the wedding reception, Chuck gives a speech about forgiveness that is implied to be directed towards Blair. She accepts his apology and the two kiss. However, as they are about to embark on a trip to Tuscany together, Chuck gets cold feet. Blair leaves for Tuscany without him, as Chuck has decided to seduce Amelia, tossing the roses for Blair in the trash can. Season 2 In the season premiere, \\"Summer Kind of Wonderful\\", we learn Blair has stayed in Europe. Chuck regretted his actions but told this to Blair too late as she was already dating Lord Marcus Beaton. Blair asks Chuck to tell her he loves her, but his fear of commitment stops him. In order to gather material for a story, Dan tags along with Chuck for a night, ending with the two of them in jail after a fistfight. While in jail, Chuck tells Dan in confidence that Chuck's mother died while giving birth to him, and that his father blames him for her death, which explains their icy relationship. When Chuck later discovers that Dan was using him for a story, he feels betrayed and tells Dan that he was lying about all of it. Chuck's storyline throughout season 2 mainly deals with his inability to tell Blair that he loves her. Eventually, his father is killed in a car accident. Then as he is about to leave after the funeral. Blair tells him that she loves him, but he leaves nevertheless. Lily adopts him so that he's able to own Bass Industries, making Serena and Eric his sister and brother. When Blair begins dating Nate again, Chuck realizes his true feelings for her. The two team up to take down Poppy Lifton, and Blair realizes that she still has feelings for Chuck as well. She breaks up with Nate. After finding out through a GossipGirl blast that Blair had sex with his uncle, he leaves after Blair tells him she loves him for the second time. In the final episode of season 2, Chuck admits to Blair his true feelings and the two finally begin a relationship. Season 3 When Season 3 returns, Chuck and Blair are very happy and very much in love. Chuck struggles to run Bass Industries to his deceased father's impeccably high standards. He buys The Empire Hotel. Halfway through the season, Chuck meets a woman claiming to be his mother called Elizabeth Fisher. After initially rejecting her, Chuck finally accepts Elizabeth and is then met with a sexual harassment claim from his former employees. Despite his innocence, he settles to keep the scandal out of the media. Jack Bass, Chuck's sinister uncle, informs the media anyway and necessitates Chuck signing the hotel over to Elizabeth to appease the public. She betrays him and signs the hotel over to Jack, whom she loves. However, she calls Chuck to say goodbye and reveals that Jack chose the hotel over her. She then reveals to Chuck that she is not his mother and she does not know whether his real mother is alive or dead. Chuck and Blair agree to team up to take down Jack to get the hotel back. Jack tells them both (separately) that he will only give up the hotel if he has sex with Blair. Unbeknown to Blair, Chuck sets the situation up and Blair goes to Jack's. After a kiss, Jack tells Blair the truth about Chuck's involvement. Blair breaks up with Chuck and he gets the hotel back, vowing to get Blair back too. Chuck tries desperately to win Blair back, doing everything from banning all of the other Upper East Side men from dating her to asking her to meet him on top of the Empire State Building. Blair decides that Chuck is her true love and she's going to meet him, but Dorota suddenly goes into labor and she ends up being two hours late. Chuck, thinking she is finally over him, leaves the building heartbroken and nearly suicidal. When he gets home, he sees that Jenny Humphrey has arrived looking for Nate. The two drunkenly sleep together, heartbroken that their true loves don't return their feelings. Blair appears later in Chuck's suite, apologizing for being late, and the two reunite (sleep together). Chuck is about to propose to Blair at the hospital, as they visit Dorota and her new baby, when Dan appears and rashly delivers a punch to Chuck's face. He then forces Chuck to tell Blair what happened between him and Jenny. Blair breaks things off with Chuck and informs him that it's over for good. She also threatens to ruin Jenny's life if she doesn't leave Manhattan immediately. Chuck then travels to Prague to escape New York for a while, feeling as though he has nothing left. He gets robbed by two muggers who insist on taking the ring that Chuck intended on proposing to Blair with and when Chuck puts up a fight, he gets shot. The last shot of season 3 is him lying in an alley, presumably dying. Season 4 In the first episode of season four, we find that Chuck is alive and well, having been rescued by Czech girl, Eva (Cl√©mence Po√©sy) who has no idea of his wealth or who he is. He creates a fake name and persona as he no longer wants to be the manipulative Chuck Bass. He eventually reveals who he really is and returns to New York City with her, at the request of Blair and Serena. Blair insists she no longer loves him, but still schemes to undermine his new relationship. He eventually falls for one of her schemes and breaks up with Eva. He realizes his mistake and begs her to take him back, but she refuses, saying that he showed his true feelings by continuing to believe Blair over anyone else. Chuck asks Blair whether she still has feelings for him, and she denies it, prompting him to declare \\"war\\" on her. He tries to \\"take\\" Columbia from her, and arranges for Jenny Humphrey to return to the city in order to stir up trouble for Blair, who still hasn't told her minions why she banished Jenny from the Upper East Side in the first place. After Jenny declares that it's only a matter of time before they both destroy each other, Chuck and Blair agree to a truce. They even draw up a contract, with the stipulation \\"no touching,\\" but their mutual attraction proves too powerful and they soon fall into an enemies-with-benefits relationship. In \\"The Witches of Bushwick\\", Chuck accidentally tells Blair during foreplay that he loves her and, not knowing whether his words are true, Blair chooses to gloss over the moment. Although Chuck and Blair spend the episode striving for different ends which will eventually alienate each other (Blair to become the face of Anne Archibald's charity, Girls Inc, and Chuck to increase the revenue of The Empire by returning to his bad boy persona), Blair makes the decision to attend Chuck's Saints and Sinners party in order to confront him. Chuck confesses that he loves her, and the pair kiss in front of everyone after the curtain concealing them is pulled down. Anne tells Blair that she can no longer be a part of Girls Inc just as Chuck's publicist KC tells Chuck that she thinks Blair will be good for business. Blair re-thinks her decision to sacrifice it all for their relationship, and she and Chuck break up once again. Chuck promises he'll wait for her, and both affirm their belief that their love will reunite them in the end. On Thanksgiving Chuck and Blair run into each other at Serena's house, Chuck offers to leave but she tells him that she was heading to JFK anyway and came to drop off the traditional pie and that they should get used to this. They hear about Serena being hospitalized and while they're sharing that maybe nothing can change between them, Jenny walks in and interrupts their conversation. While driving Blair home, Chuck tells her that he showed up only for Serena. When she told him that what happened with Serena made her question what she told him after the Saints & Sinners party; Chuck tells her that he cannot be her friend now as much as he wishes he could. After that Blair still sends him her traditional pie, saying that even if they can't be friends it doesn't mean that they aren't. In \\"The Townie\\" episode, It was revealed that Lily was going to sell Bass Industries instead of giving Chuck the company back. So he sets off to New Zealand, where his uncle Jack Bass is currently living. In the following episodes Chuck returns to the Upper East Side with revenge for Lily. Chuck's new love interest is Raina and her father is Russell Thorpe, a former rival of Chuck's late father Bart Bass. Russell is the main contender to buy Bass industries. Chuck, however, manages to save the company after it is revealed that Russell accidentally killed his wife in a building fire that Bart was originally accused of. In \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" he learns that Blair's relationship with Louis is serious, and that there is talk about them getting engaged. He gets drunk and embarrasses Blair in front of Louis' mother, and later tries to force himself on her, while pushing her down and smashing a glass window right next to her face, after she tells him about her engagement. Blair ends up with her cheek being cut. Later, Blair is kidnapped by Russell, but Chuck saves her, and the two go to a Bar Mitzah. There, the two are seen dancing and smiling happily. Blair pulls him off the dance floor into a private room and the two have sex. Blair decides she is going to leave Louis, but Chuck stops her, telling her that she needs to be with Louis because he makes her happy. At the end of the episode, Chuck decides to spend the summer traveling with Nate. =Controversy= Following the 20th episode of Season 4, Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair. Season 5 In the first episode of season 5, we find out that Chuck has spent his summer traveling the world with Nate. The two arrive in Los Angeles to meet up with Serena, who is working as an assistant on a film set. Seemingly over his break up with Blair, Chuck exhibits a positive outlook on life, telling Serena and Nate that he's seeking to experience everything he can in life. However, his heartbreak soon becomes apparent when he receives an invitation to Blair's upcoming wedding, which causes him to drive recklessly and get into a motorbike accident. In the following episode, it is revealed that Chuck has an emotional disorder as a result of his losing Blair, and which now causes him to be numb to physical and emotional stimuli. Dan decides to help Chuck break through this emotional barrier, and gets him a dog, hoping to spark some emotion. However, it is only when Blair reveals to him that she is pregnant with Louis's baby does Chuck begin feel again ‚Äì he is shown crying over the revelation at the end of the episode. He names the dog \\"Monkey\\" (a homage to the pet monkey Chuck's character had in the books). He forms a reluctant friendship with Dan from here on. He meets a psychiatrist, Eliza Barnes, who tells him that he acts out because he never had a childhood, and needs help. When he finds himself falling back into his old patterns, he calls Dr. Barnes, ready to seek that help. However, it is revealed that Blair's fianc√©, Louis, gives Dr. Barnes money to upset Chuck, in hopes that he will do something reckless and drive Blair away forever. When Chuck finds this out, he publicly exposes both Dr. Barnes and Louis, leaving Blair devastated. Later that same night, he goes to Blair's apartment to finally apologize to her for all the times he's hurt her and let her down. His apology recounts all the obstacles Chuck and Blair have faced in their relationship thus far, and prompts an emotional Blair to thank him. Chuck assures her that she is going to be \\"an amazing mother\\", having come to terms with her relationship with Louis. He resolves to keep his distance from her after that, but in \\"The Big Sleep No More\\", a conflicted Blair seduces him in the hope to prove that his efforts to be a better man is just a ploy to win her back. When he kisses her, she slaps him, and tells him that he will never change. It is later revealed that he conspired with Dorota and kissed Blair in order to confirm her suspicions of him, and push her back to Louis. In the episode \\"Riding in Town Cars with Boys\\" he admits to Blair that he still loves her. They profess their love for one another in Chuck's limo. This occurs whilst the limo is being chased by paparazzi on motorbikes and results in a car crash. Lily reveals at the conclusion of the episode that Blair is awake and doing fine, but whether or not Chuck has survived was not revealed. We later discover that Chuck did indeed survive the accident after a blood transfusion was donated to him. He wakes up to a very distant Blair, very opposite to the one he got into an accident with. For the next few episodes he chases her to discover what has changed her mind ‚Äì unbeknownst to him, Blair has made a pact with God over his life, where if she breaks her promise to Louis, Chuck will surely die. This leads to Blair going to Chuck's penthouse in the episode \\"The End of the Affair\\" where she tells him what a good man he has become and to not let the ending of their relationship destroy him. In G.G., Chuck is willing to accept the fact that Blair is marrying another man, when Blair's mother tries to convince him to stop the wedding. He makes one final play for Blair, but Blair ‚Äì despite saying that she \\"loves him more and more every day, if it's even possible to love somebody that much\\" ‚Äì once more rebuffs him, saying that she's actually doing this for him. Their conversation is unknowingly recorded, and released in a blast by Gossip Girl during the wedding. Despite this, Blair still marries Louis, but flees the reception with Dan when Louis reveals that their relationship is now strictly business. With the help of Dan, Blair tries to leave for the Dominican Republic to get a divorce from Louis without his consent due to a loophole in the Dominican Republic's law, but forgets her passport. Chuck, Nate and Serena eventually find Blair hiding out in a hotel room with Dan. However, Sophia finds Blair and threatens to forcefully sell Eleanor's company as dowry if Blair chooses not to return. Blair reluctantly goes back to Louis, despite an offer from Chuck to pay her dowry. In \\"Cross Rhodes\\", Blair realizes she now has feelings for Dan, and Chuck and Serena struggle with watching their loves with their friends. In \\"The Princess Dowry\\", Chuck pays Blair's dowry so she can be free, but wishes for it to remain a secret. She finds out and accuses him of wanting to own her. He admits that he paid the dowry, but for her freedom and her freedom only. At the end of the episode, Blair begins a relationship with Dan. In \\"Con Heir\\", Chuck invites his uncle, Jack, back to New York to thank him for saving his life in the car accident by donating blood, but starts to doubt Jack's story when Chuck investigates and learns that Jack was recently diagnosed positive with Hepatitis C, and a test on Chuck turns to be negative. This kicks off a lot of \\"mother/father\\" issues for Chuck ‚Äì he believes that it was Elizabeth Fisher who donated the blood, then Diana says that she is his mother when Bart cheated on Elizabeth with her (she claims that an arrangement was made with Diana leaving town alone, leaving Chuck to be raised by Bart and Elizabeth because Elizabeth couldn't get pregnant), but in \\"Despicable B\\", Nate receives a picture from Elizabeth that indeed shows her pregnant with Chuck. Chuck is more interested in the man in the picture with Elizabeth ‚Äì his face is cut out, but his tattooed arm is still visible. Jack Bass has exactly the same tattoo. It all comes to a head in \\"Raiders of the Lost Art\\", when he, Blair, Serena, Nate and Lola team together to crack the code in Diana's day planner ‚Äì the code they believe will lead them to Jack Bass. They end up at a brothel that Diana is in charge of. Diana realizes that they are there and has the event shut down. During the chaos, Blair searches one of the rooms, still looking for Jack, and is shocked by what she sees. Blair later tells Chuck to re-enter the building once everyone is gone, which he does, and it is revealed that Bart Bass is still alive. Bart reveals that he faked his death to save Chuck and Lily, and has been hiding from everyone for the past three years. The car crash actually happened, and that it was ordered by one of Bart's enemies. When he was in the hospital, he paid the doctor to say he died and then recruited Diana Payne to help him hide. Diana kept Bart informed of when Chuck was in trouble, so when Chuck was in the hospital, Bart was the one who donated his blood to save Chuck. In \\"The Return of the Ring\\", Bart drops the bombshell that he will be returning to Bass Industries as \\"the only Bass in Bass Industries\\", pushing Chuck out of the company. Bart tells Chuck that the most he did was 'redecorate' and give everything up for Blair. After this, Blair declares her love for Chuck, admitting she finally really wants them to be together. Chuck rejects her in anger, shadowing the words she once said to him: \\"I don't want to be Mr. Blair Waldorf.\\" Chuck pairs up with an unlikely partner ‚Äì Jack ‚Äì to take down his father. They meet in a casino in Monte Carlo. Blair turns up, informed by Jack of Chuck's whereabouts. Blair reveals she is 'all in' and one hundred per cent ready to be with him. His decision on the matter is thus far unknown. Season 6 At the beginning of the season Chuck and Blair make a pact not to be together until Blair succeeds at Waldorf Designs and Chuck takes down Bart. After many failed attempts of taking down Bart, Bart and Chuck end up in a fight. This leads to Bart falling off a building and dying. Blair is the only witness to this event and so Chuck and Blair get married so Blair does not have to testify against Chuck. In the 5-year flash forward, Chuck and Blair are happily married with a son (Henry). They are all gathered at the Bass house for Dan and Serena's wedding. Characterization Ed Westwick who portrays the character on the television series said: \\"As the [first] season's progressed, I think everyone's had sympathy for him. I think he's an alluring character; he's very interesting. He has these slices of his personality. He can be the devil, but at times he can be very charming. It can be a very dangerous concoction. I think he has a good heart, but his heart is often tempted by corrupt desires.\\" He later added: \\"He's intelligent and quite slimy in the way he manipulates to his gain. He goes after what he wants. Sometimes that's not a good thing. He's got a long way to go before he's a nice guy.\\" Westwick also said: \\"Chuck's just this vain kind of metrosexual Manhattan eccentric living in a flash world.\\" While describing Chuck as \\"mischievous\\", Westwick noted the second season displayed a \\"more good-guy\\" side of him. Ultimately, he said Chuck is a \\"kid trying to find his way in the world.\\" Denise Martin of the Los Angeles Times characterizes him as more of \\"a would-be Casanova than a seasoned predator. He's the charming devil at the center of all the intrigues, the go-to guy when something naughty needs to be said and he's the most self-aware of the Upper East Side high schoolers. Stephanie Savage, one of the television series' creators, described him as \\"entertaining and observationally smart, he's the friend who says all the things you want to say but can't, and he tempts you in ways, at that age, you want to be tempted.\\" She compared his relationship with Blair to Glenn Close and John Malkovich's in Dangerous Liaisons. She found Westwick's portrayal of Chuck was similar to James Spader of Pretty in Pink and Robert Downey, Jr.. Savage said about the character's evolution during the six seasons: \\"I feel like Chuck has gone on the biggest journey of any one on the show. In the pilot, he's pretty much a pure villain. He's not a character that has a lot of layers. That was something Ed Westwick really brought as an actor. And his chemistry with Leighton [Meester] ‚Äî when we saw them together on screen and the power of the two of them working together but also being attracted to each other, which really inspired us to grow that character and give him some more layers.\\" Reception Entertainment Weekly named Chuck Bass and Blair Waldorf number one in their \\"Best Dressed TV characters of 2008\\" list, as well as in their \\"Best Performances\\" list for Ed Westwick, alongside co-star Leighton Meester. His relationship with Blair was included in TV Guide's list of \\"The Best TV Couples of All Time\\" as well as Entertainment Weekly \\"30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples\\". The character also made the \\"Forbes Fictional 15\\" ranking at number 13 with an estimated $1.1 billion fortune.Richest Fictional Characters Opinions Wealth Retrieved: 2010-06-20.

It was designed by French architect Ernest H√©brard in 1918, but most of the square was built in the 1950s. Many buildings surrounding the central square have since been renovated and its northern parts were largely restored in the 2000s. The twelve buildings that make up Aristotelous Square have been listed buildings of the Hellenic Republic since 1950. History The history of Aristotelous Square begins with the Great Fire of 1917 that destroyed two thirds of the city of Thessaloniki. Before the fire Thessaloniki in the late 19th century. Before the Great Fire of 1917, the city lacked much of what was considered to be 'essential' in European architecture. Until 1912, Thessaloniki had been part of Ottoman Turkey for almost 500 years. Under Ottoman rule, the city grew without the guidance of a general plan for expansion and had narrow streets. The absence of squares in pre-1917 Thessaloniki was addressed by Ernest H√©brard, who proposed a number of large squares in the city, including Megalou Alexandrou Square (\\"Alexander the Great Square\\"), now Aristotelous Square. Designs by Ernest H√©brard Sea-level view of Alexander the Great Square, as designed by H√©brard in 1918. Ernest H√©brard envisioned a monumental axis for Thessaloniki that stretched from what is now Aristotelous Square on the seafront to Dikastirion Square and the Roman Forum. The axis began at Aristotelous Square, which was intended to be named after Alexander the Great. Throughout his plan for Thessaloniki, H√©brard implemented an element that was missing from the pre-1917 architecture of the city: imposing fa√ßades. For the monumental axis, the architect used elements from Byzantine and Western architecture rather than Ottoman architecture, to stress the city's connection with the Byzantine Empire. This style is most evident at Aristotelous Square, with a few building facades implementing some of H√©brard's original ideas. Additionally, a statue of Alexander the Great was to be placed in the middle of the square. H√©brard's additional proposal for a Place Civique. H√©brard designed the monumental axis so that looking uphill from the square one could see the city's Byzantine walls and the Upper Town. Also visible from the square would be what H√©brard called the Place Civique or Civic Square, which would be the city's administrative heart along European lines: it would feature the City Hall on the left, the court houses on the right and a grand triumphant arch leading uphill from the Civic Square. This part of the design was never realized due to a lack of funds, although following archeological excavations unearthed the ancient Roman agora at the same spot were the Civic Square was planned. Since the first concept designs by H√©brard in 1918, his designs for Aristotelous Square were simplified considerably. Instead of the original elaborate designs, the fa√ßades that were built in the 1950s were much more modest, due to the financial situation of the country at the time and the decision of the Venizelos government in 1918 to fund the project from private sources and not the government. Present day Today, Aristotelous Square is one of the most famous places in all of Greece and almost synonymous with the city of Thessaloniki itself. The square plays an important role in the sociopolitical life not only of the city, but of the wider country as well. Numerous large rallies and political speeches have been organized in Aristotelous Square, such as the rally for Macedonia in 1992 (see further below). Additionally the square is used for many cultural events, such as festivals and the annual Christmas and carnival celebrations. It is an important tourist attraction for the city, and the numerous cafes and bars that line up the square make it popular with the younger generations. The two quarter-circle sides of the square are occupied by important buildings. On the left is Electra Palace Hotel, which is one of the best five-star hotels in Thessaloniki and on the right is one of the city's most famous movie theaters, the Olympion Theatre cinema, site of the annual Thessaloniki International Film Festival. It also houses a very popular bar of the same name. Future redevelopment There is no redevelopment currently under consideration, but numerous proposals have been submitted over the past twenty years. When Thessaloniki became the European capital of culture during 1997, the city council put together an organizing committee for the redevelopment of the waterfront of the city, including the redevelopment of Aristotelous Square. Of the many designs that were presented to the committee, some of them were very radical and others less so. In almost all proposals, there were provisions for a marina or a similar extension of the square onto waterfront, as well as a wheel similar to the London Eye in London. Up to date, no official redevelopment scheme has been made official. The current mayor of Thessaloniki, Yannis Boutaris, mentioned in his electoral campaign that Thessaloniki would undergo a major redevelopment to bring it into the 21st century, but so far no designs or any new announcements have been made public.

Every year the municipality organizes the Celebration of the Angels (Greek: ŒìŒπŒøœÅœÑŒÆ œÑœâŒΩ ŒëŒ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªœâŒΩ), which is the official lighting ceremony for the Christmas tree and is accompanied by other festive activities, including bands, choirs, popular Greek singers and fireworks displays. Similar celebrations are organized annually on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Following Greek traditions, apart from a Christmas tree, the municipality of Thessaloniki also decorates a giant Christmas ship, which is a Greek variant of the custom of decorating a Christmas tree. Both the Christmas tree and the Christmas boat are over 20 meters tall and are considered a tourist attraction for visitors to the city at the time they are up. Political activity A political rally organized by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement in Aristotelous Square. A map of Aristotelous Square and the surrounding areas from OpenStreetMap. Since its creation, the square has been used for a number of important party rallies. Many former Prime Ministers of Greece have given their main address from Aristotelous Square, including Andreas Papandreou, Costas Karamanlis and George Papandreou. Apart from partisan action, there have also been numerous demonstrations in the square that were not backed by any particular party. Under the nationalist rush against the Republic of Macedonia in the early 1990s over the Macedonia naming dispute, a huge demonstration was organized in the square in February 1992 \\"to show support for the Greekness of Macedonia\\". During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, a large demonstration also took place in the square that reaffirmed the Greek people's disapproval of the NATO bombing and to show their support for the Serbian people. Many other demonstrations have been held in the square in recent years on a variety of subjects ranging from religious affairs, education reforms and the economic crisis. Transportation When the first buildings in the square were constructed in the late 1950s, the square was served by Thessaloniki's extensive tram network but the service was discontinued in 1957. Since then, the only means of public transportation to and from Aristotle Square is by the buses of the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH). The city's horse shoe shape and the square's location within the city center make it easily reachable by OASTH, with many lines passing either through Aristotelous or by Venizelou Square. Additionally, there are taxi stands on Mitropoleos Street (a street which \\"cuts\\" the square in half), in front of the Olympion Theatre. The under-construction Thessaloniki Metro will have one station near Aristotelous Square, at Venizelou Street, a short walk away from Aristotelous on Egnatia Avenue. Other means of transportation that have been proposed are ferry services to the other pivotal points of coastal Thessaloniki. In popular culture A redesign concept from the late 1980s.

USS Sirona served as a commissioned ship for 13 months. Sirona (AKA-43) was laid down on 15 February 1945 under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1904) by the Walsh-Kaiser Co., Inc., Providence, R.I.; launched on 17 April 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Lawrence B. Harris; and commissioned on 10 May 1945, Lt. Comdr. Joseph A. Neal, USNR, in command. Service history Sirona arrived at Hampton Roads on 24 May 1945 and underwent abbreviated shakedown training there from 28 May to 1 June. After a brief repair period, she departed Norfolk on 7 June for France, arriving at Marseille on the 21st. There she loaded troops and supplies and sailed for the Pacific, transiting the Panama Canal on 11 July. On the 28th, she rendered medical assistance to the crew of tanker Esso Rochester; and, after calls at Eniwetok and Ulithi, she arrived at Manila on 13 August. On 25 August, Sirona left Manila as part of a large transport force bound for Tokyo, Japan. She remained in Tokyo Bay from 2-5 September and arrived at Okinawa on the 7th. Upkeep there was interrupted when she got underway to avoid a typhoon between the 16th and 18th. On the 19th, the ship embarked 200 Marines and 514 tons of cargo; and, on the 27th, she sailed with a large transport group, which arrived at Taku, China, on 30 September. She offloaded her troops and cargo there on 4 and 5 October and then sailed for Manila on the 6th. Upon arrival at Manila, Sirona's crew built temporary troop berthing facilities in her cargo holds, adding 295 berths to the 264 in her normal troop quarters. The ship departed Manila on 22 October; and, upon arrival at Kowloon on the 24th, she embarked 1,035 troops of the 13th Chinese Army, with 34 tons of rice, small-arms ammunition, and light equipment. She sailed with six other transports on the 25th for Darien, Manchuria; but, on the 28th, was diverted to Chinwangtao where she disembarked her troops and cargo on 30 and 31 October. Returning to Kowloon on 7 November, she embarked about 800 men of the Chinese Honorable 1st Division, which she delivered at Tsingtao on the 14th. The ship remained there until being assigned on the 26th to return servicemen to the United States under operation \\"Magic Carpet\\". Between 29 November and 1 December, she embarked 504 troops at Shanghai and disembarked them at Seattle on 16 December. Sirona was detached from the \\"Magic Carpet\\" force on 30 December, and remained in Seattle pending a decision on her postwar employment. On 9 April 1946, she sailed from Seattle and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 May. There, she was decommissioned on 12 June and transferred the same day to the Maritime Commission for service as the training ship Yankee States at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946, the ship was laid up in the Maritime Commission Reserve Fleet in the James River on 29 July 1947; and was sold to the Boston Metals Corp., Baltimore, Maryland., on 17 May 1966 for scrapping.

The battalion was recruited from Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia and formed part of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. It served throughout the war, firstly during the Gallipoli Campaign and then on the Western Front. During the interwar years, the 12th Battalion was re-raised as a part-time military unit and during the Second World War undertook garrison duties in Australia, but did not see combat. Today its lineage is perpetuated by the 12th/40th Battalion, Royal Tasmania Regiment, a unit which continues to serve in the Australian Army Reserve. History=First World War The battalion was raised as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) within three weeks of the declaration of war in August 1914, and left Australia just two months later. Part of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division it was formed from recruits from Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lancelot Clarke, the battalion proceeded to Egypt on HMAT A2 Geelong, arriving on 2 December. A period of training in the desert followed to prepare the Australian forces for their eventual transfer to Europe, but in late April they were committed to the Gallipoli Campaign. The 3rd Brigade was the covering force for the Anzac landing on 25 April 1915, and went ashore at around 4.30 am. During the early fighting on the first, the battalion's commanding officer was killed by a sniper. After the initial landing, a stalemate developed around the beachhead and in August the Allies sought to break the deadlock by launching the August Offensive. As a part of this, the 12th contributed two companies to the diversionary attack on Lone Pine. The offensive failed, but the campaign continued and the battalion remained served on the Gallipoli Peninsula until early December when it was withdrawn to Lemnos Island for rest. While there, Lieutenant Colonel John Gellibrand took command of the battalion. In late December, the Allied forces were evacuated from Gallipoli and the battalion returned to Egypt in January 1916, where the AIF was reorganised and expanded. During this process, the 12th Battalion provided an experienced cadre of troops to the newly raised 52nd Battalion. In March 1916, the AIF's infantry divisions were transferred to the Western Front, and after arriving in France, the 12th Battalion deployed to the Somme. The battalion's first major action in France was at Pozi√®res in July 1916. Later the battalion fought at Ypres, in Belgium, before returning to the Somme in winter. In 1917, the battalion returned to Belgium to take part the Third Battle of Ypres. James Newland, one of the 12th Battalion's two Victoria Cross recipients In 1918, the battalion helped to stop the German Spring Offensive that was launched in March and April. The battalion subsequently participated in the last Allied offensive of 1918, launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918. After Amiens, a series of advances followed as the Allies broke through the Hindenburg Line. The battalion continued operations until late September 1918 when it was withdrawn from the line for rest. Following the end of the war members of the battalion began returning to Australia in November for demobilisation and discharge. The 12th Battalion was disbanded in 1919 having sustained casualties of 1,135 killed and 2,422 wounded. Two members of the battalion received the Victoria Cross for their actions during the war: James Newland and John Whittle. Inter war years and subsequent service In 1921, the battalion was re-raised as part the re-organisation of the Australian military that took place at that time. Upon re-forming, the battalion formed part of the 12th Brigade, which was formed within the 6th Military District headquartered in Tasmania. In 1927, it received the title \\"The Launceston Regiment\\". The battalion was subsequently amalgamated with the 50th Battalion as the \\"12th/50th Battalion (The Launceston Regiment/The Tasmanian Rangers)\\" on 1 December 1936. During the Second World War, the two battalions remained linked, serving as part of York Force and undertaking garrison duties in the Northern Territory. On 2 May 1945 the 12th/50th Battalion was amalgamated with the 40th Battalion (\\"The Derwent Regiment\\") and became the 12th/40th Battalion. The battalion was disbanded in 1946, having not seen combat during the war. Reformed in 1948 as part of the Citizens Military Force, the 12/40th Battalion was unlinked in 1953 with both battalions being reformed in their own right at that time. In 1961, the 12th Battalion was awarded the Second World War battle honours of the 2/12th Battalion (AIF). The battalion was granted the freedom of the City of Launceston in May 1960. In the early 1960s, the Australian Army adopted the Pentropic divisional establishment, which resulted in the regionally-based regiments being subsumed into larger State-based regiments. As a result, the 12th Battalion formed 'A' Company within the Pentropically-organised 1st Battalion, The Royal Tasmania Regiment (1 RTR). In 1972, 1 RTR was split up and the 12th and 40th Battalions reformed, but this was only short lived as both formations were reduced to independent rifle companies in 1975. The 12th and 40th Independent Rifle Companies were amalgamated in 1987 as part of a reorganisation of Australia's reserve infantry force, forming the 12th/40th Battalion, Royal Tasmania Regiment, a unit which continues to serve in the Australian Army Reserve.

Founded by Manuel Gir√≥, an industrialist from Barcelona, Ossa was best known for lightweight, two-stroke- engined bikes used in observed trials, motocross and enduro. The company was known originally as Orpheo Sincronic Sociedad An√≥nima (O.S.S.A.) and was later renamed Maquinaria Cinematogr√°fica, S.A.. The Ossa brand was reborn in 2010 when the trademark was purchased by an investment group and produced motorcycles until 2014 when, the company merged with the Spanish motorcycle manufacturer Gas Gas but when Gas Gas was absorbed by the Torrot Group in 2015, Ossa was not part of the deal and closed down again. History=Company origins The original Ossa company got its start in 1924 making movie projectors for its home market in Spain. The company's four-leaf clover emblem wasn't actually a four-leaf clover; it is the escapement mechanism of a film projector. Before World War II, Gir√≥ was the Spanish sidecar racing national champion, along with his co-pilot, the future founder of Bultaco motorcycles, Francisco Bult√≥. After World War II, Ossa obtained superior two- stroke engine technology from the German DKW factory as war reparations and, began mass-producing two-stroke motorcycles in 1949. Ossa reached its highest production levels in the motorcycle boom of the 1960s, exporting large numbers of exports to other European countries, but also significantly, to North American markets. In the United States and Canada, off-road motorcycling - and particularly the newly imported sport of motocross to which the light-weight and powerful Ossa was well suited - enjoyed a surging popularity. In addition to their suitability for racing, in terms of power-to-weight, Ossa motorcycles gained a reputation for reliability on and off the race track. Motorsport competition The Ossa firm was a strong supporter of all forms of motorcycle sport including: road racing, motocross, enduro and observed trials. Their first success came at the 1967 24 Hours of Montjuich on the streets of Barcelona. Against all the major Spanish factories, Ossa motorcycles finished a surprising first and second. Inspired by this success, the factory decided to compete abroad in order to make inroads into the international market. 1968 Ossa 250 cc Grand Prix racer Monocoque Grand Prix racer Ossa achieved early success in the 250cc class of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, competing with an innovative chassis designed by Gir√≥'s son, Eduardo that was unique for the era. Eduardo Gir√≥ designed a motorcycle that compensated for its power deficit by following a philosophy of lightweight, a small frontal area and engine reliability combined with outstanding handling. The motorcycle featured a welded monocoque construction of magnesium and aluminium sheets that incorporated the fuel tank and weighed a full less than the Japanese competition. The monocoque's superior chassis stiffness and weight imbued it with exceptional cornering and braking abilities which, in turn allowed for faster cornering speeds than the competition. Although Ossa's 249cc single cylinder two stroke engine produced 20 horsepower less than that of the class- leading Yamaha RD05 with its impressive V4 engine, Spanish rider Santiago Herrero was able to take advantage of the Ossa's light weight and superior handling characteristics to remain competitive, especially on tighter race tracks. Grand Prix success ends in tragedy After having won the 250cc Spanish national championship in 1967 and 1968, Ossa and Herrero moved up to the world championships where, they finished seventh 1968 250cc world championship including an impressive third place finish behind the factory- backed Yamahas of Phil Read and Bill Ivy at the season-ending Nations Grand Prix held at the high speed Monza circuit. In 1969, the FIM changed its regulations in an effort to reduce spiraling costs in motorcycle racing. 125cc and 250cc machines would be limited to two cylinders and 6-speed transmissions. This regulation change caused the dominant Yamaha and Suzuki factories to withdraw their teams from Grand Prix racing. The 1969 Grand Prix season would be even more successful for the Ossa factory as, Herrero won three races and, held a one point lead in the 250cc world championship going into the last race of the season in Yugoslavia. Herrero started the race in the lead but, crashed on the seventh lap ending his championship hopes. He would finish third in the world championship. Ossa and Herrero repeated as Spanish 250cc national champion for a third consecutive year. After a promising start to the 1970 season in which Herrero won his fourth 250cc Grand Prix, he died after crashing on melted tar during the 1970 Isle of Man TT. Herrero's death affected the Ossa team so much that they withdrew from road racing competitions altogether. Off-road racing successes Ossa also achieved some success in the AMA Grand National Championship, with rider Dick Mann helping them develop a 250cc dirt track bike on which he won the 1969 Santa Fe Grand National short track event, held on a quarter-mile dirt track oval. 1972 Ossa Mick Andrews Replica After withdrawing from Grand Prix motorcycle racing, Ossa redirected their competitive efforts into the sport of Observed Trials in Europe and the United States alongside such other famous Spanish makes as Bultaco and Montesa. Ossa hired British rider Mick Andrews to help design and ride their trials bike, and they went on to capture the 1971 and 1972 European Trials Championship, the forerunner to the FIM World Championship. Andrews won the grueling Scottish Six Days Trial three consecutive years between 1970 and 1972 for the Ossa factory. Final years Despite success in racing competitions, the firm suffered from a disorganized and sparse dealer network in the important American market. Ironically, the motorcycle boom that created a new market and allowed the European makers to reap great financial rewards, was also the seed of their own demise, and that of the numerous smaller firms, such as Ossa. With so many choices for both buyers and dealers, sales and service networks were not sustainable, and attempts to improve manufacturing by investing in new factories back home put Ossa, like virtually every other European firm, deep into the red. In the declining years of the Franco Era, in 1975, the Spanish government steadily converted Spain's economic structure into one more closely resembling a free-market economy. The arrival of cheaper Japanese motorcycles into the local economy as well as a crippling employee strike in 1977 spurred the downfall of the Ossa company. By 1984 Ossa was under the control of a labor cooperative, and the following year its name was changed to Ossamoto. Nonetheless, as a Vintage make, the Ossa still enjoys a significant following among home hobbyists and amateur racers. Rebirth In 2010, a group of Spanish businessmen purchased the rights to the Ossa trademark and began producing Ossa branded motorcycles once again. The new firm produced trials and enduro models. The factory team competed in the 2011 FIM Trials world championship, with factory sponsored rider Jeroni Fajardo finishing the season in fifth place. In 2014 Ossa merged with the motorcycle manufacturer Gas Gas but, when Gas Gas was absorbed by the Spanish bicycle and scooter manufacturer Torrot in 2015, Ossa was not part of the deal and closed down again. Gas Gas was bought by KTM in late 2019. Ossa-based bikes *Ossa SPQ, OSSA Seurat Piron Queyrel.

Individuals with TRAPS have episodic symptoms such as recurrent high fevers, rash, abdominal pain, joint/muscle aches and puffy eyes. Symptoms and signs TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome presents with the following signs and symptoms: * Episodic fever * Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate * Pericarditis * Splenomegaly * Uveitis * Vertigo Cause TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome is autosomal dominant, and about 70 mutations of the TNFRSF1A gene have been linked to this condition. Its cytogenetic location is at 12p13.31. Mechanism Macrophage The main source of TNF (tumor necrosis factor) are cells in the immune system called macrophages which produce it in response to infection and other stimuli. TNF helps activate other immune cells and plays a major role in initiation of inflammation. Individuals with TRAPS have a mutation in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) gene; the mechanisms by which mutations in TNFR1 lead to the TRAPS phenotype are still unknown. Impaired shedding of the TNF receptor is one of the possible defects, most mutations affect the extracellular domain of the receptor, some also the cleavage site. Diagnosis The diagnosis of TRAPS may show an increased IgD level in a possibly affected individual, other methods to ascertain a definite finding is via the following: * Blood test * Genetic test * Clinical evaluation Treatment Corticosteroid In terms of treatment for TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome, corticosteroids can be administered for the reduction of the severity of this condition, NSAIDS may be used for fever.

History The original mansion was built between 1548 and 1560 by Fran√ßoise of Luxembourg and her son, Lamoral, Count of Egmont, first in a Flemish Gothic, and later Renaissance style. The fabric was dramatically transformed in the 18th century, when the property passed onto the Arenberg family, and the building was clothed in a neoclassical style. The plans for this stage are attributed to the early advocate of neoclassicism, Giovanni Niccol√≤ Servandoni. After a fire demolished the oldest part of the building in 1891, it was reconstructed in a uniform neoclassical style. The venue hosted the fencing events for the 1920 Summer Olympics in the garden.Sports-reference.com profile of the 1920 Summer Olympics fencing events. After World War I, the German Arenberg family was forced to sell the building to the City of Brussels. In 1964, it was sold to the Belgian state. In 1977, the Egmont pact on the Belgian state reform was signed in the Egmont Palace during the second administration of then Prime Minister of Belgium Leo Tindemans. Since 1992, the palace has been listed as a protected monument.

He was then picked on the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour and made his Test debut in that Ashes series against Great Britain. He played in two Tests and fifteen minor matches on tour. Later in 1960 he played in all three Tests of the domestic series against France. Whiticker/Hudson \\"The Encyclopedia Of Rugby League Players (1995 Edition) () Rasmussen relocated to New South Wales and joined St George in 1962. He played 122 games for St George till 1968 and played in five successive winning Grand finals from 1962 to 1966, the first at lock and the rest in the second-row. He represented again for Australia in 1962 against Great Britain, made a second Kangaroo tour in 1967 playing in all six Tests and twelve minor touring matches. His final national appearances were in the 1968 World Cup where he appeared in one pool match and in Australia's victory in the final over France. Rasmussen captain-coached Brisbane Souths in 1969 and again earned Queensland representative honours in that year. Death Rasmussen died suddenly in 1978 from a heart attack at Greenmount near Toowoomba, Queensland aged 41.

The district has an area of , and a population of 191,173 at the 2011 census, an increase of 69.256% from the preceding 2001 Census. The district headquarters is Daman. Daman lies at the mouth of the Daman Ganga River. Major industries have units here. The closest railway station is Vapi (7 km). It is also famous for its beach, Portuguese colonial architecture, churches, and for the scenic beauty in the twin towns of Nani-Daman and Moti-Daman, which lie opposite each other across the Daman Ganga. The city of Surat lies to the north, and Mumbai lies approximately 160 km (100 mi) south of Daman on the Arabian Sea coast in Maharashtra state. History The edict of the Emperor Ashoka (273 to 136 BC) was found in Saurashtra and Sopara near Bombay. Satrya Kshatrapas under the Kushana emperor seemed to have ruled over Daman District during the 1st century, AD. The coins of Bhumaka and Nahapan, the kshaharata rulers were discovered in the surrounding areas of Surat District. Ushavadatta, son-in-law of Nahapan, is said to have provided ferries on rivers Dhanuha Dhamana, Parada and Tapi. This is the earliest reference of these rivers and the names of the places, i.e. Dahanu, Daman and Pardi, remained unchanged for the last 2000 years. The District seems to have been subjected to the rule of Gautamaputra Satakarnin, about 125 AD, who drove away the Kshaharatas. But Satavahana's rule was short lived. The territory of Daman during the Portuguese colonial period Rudraman I, grandson of Chastan of Kadamaka branch of Kshatrapas reconquered a large part of Western India including the seaboard from the river Mahi in Gujarat to Ratnagiri by about 150 AD from Satavahana ruler, Satakarni, and Daman district again passed under the rule of Kshatrapa Vijayasen (234-239 AD) who seems to have ruled over the district till 249 AD. Abhir king Ishwarasena of Nasik, who conquered the western part of the Deccan from the Satavahanas seems to have been laid by Gautamaputra Yajnashri, campaigns the Kshatrapas from 180 to 200 AD. The District seems to have been subjected to the rule of traikutakas during the 5th century, AD. The Lata Country was ruled by Rashtrakutas of Malkhed in the Deccan directly till 808 by the successors, Govinda II (575- 795 AD), Druvaraja - I (795-800) and Govinda III (800-808). Govinda III handed over the Lata kingdom to his brother Indra about 808 and was given the title Lateswaramandalasya or the protector of Latamandala. Indra was succeeded by his son Karka who seems to have ruled Latamandala with his brother, Govinda jointly till 826. Druva II, son of Karka came to the throne about 835 and was succeeded by Akalavarsha in 867. The District was passed to Tailappa II of the Chalupas of Kalyani in 973. Tailappa II placed Lata Country in the hands of his relative and general Barrpa alias Dvarappa Chalukya. By the middle of the 13th century, a Rajput prince Ramsingh alias Ramashah seems to have defeated the koli chief Nathorat and established himself in the hilly tract at Asheri of Asserseta near Daman about 1262. Ramsingh was succeeded by his son Somanath in 1295. The newly founded Ramnagar at the foot of the ghats flourished under Somnath (1335-1360) and Daram shah (1360-1391). Jagatshah succeeded Gopushah and ruled during 1432 to 1470. The Portuguese from Shah of Gujarat acquired Daman. They noticed the port of Daman for the first time in 1523. A Portuguese enclave for four centuries and a half till the close of the colonial rule in 1961; Daman has been a coveted prize for which princes, monarchs and alien powers waged wars. Muted memories of history lie vaulted in the monuments of Daman. It had been a melting pot, where races and cultures met and mixed to bring forth a multi-coloured identity. Daman was occupied by the Portuguese in 1531, and was formally ceded to Portugal in 1539 by the Sultan of Gujarat. Mirroring the system of administrative division in European Portugal, Daman district (Distrito de Dam√£o) was established as an administrative division of the Portuguese State of India (Estado da √çndia) in the first half of the 19th century. The District was made up of the Portuguese territories of Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. It was headed by a district governor, subordinate to the governor-general of Portuguese India in Goa. The district was divided in the two municipalities of Daman and Nagar Haveli, which were further subdivided into civil parishes. The Dadra and Nagar Haveli landlocked parts of the Daman district were occupied by pro-Indian Union forces in 1954. In 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was officially annexed by India, forming a union territory separated from Daman. The rest of the District remained under Portuguese rule until it was annexed by Indian forces on 19 December 1961. From 1961-87, it was a part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. In 1987, it became a part of the newly formed union territory of Daman and Diu. Divisions Daman district has only one tehsil - Daman. The territory of the whole district is part of Daman and Diu Lok Sabha constituency. Demographics The district is infamous for having the least balanced sex ratio in the country. According to the 2011 census Daman District, India has a population of 191,173, roughly equal to the nation of Samoa. This gives it a ranking of 592nd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 69.256%. Daman has a sex ratio of 533 females for every 1,000 males, and a literacy rate of 88.06%. Transport Daman is connected by roads and is 12 km from Vapi, 125 km from Surat, and 195 km from Mumbai. Vapi railway station on the Western Railway is the station nearest to Daman, and connects to all major cities. Daman Airport has a Coast Guard air base. A bridge over the Daman Ganga between Moti Daman and Nani Daman collapsed during a monsoon on 28 August 2003, killing 27 school children and one teacher when their vehicles plunged into the river. \\"Part of Daman bridge collapses, no casualities\\" (sic), Outlook (Aug 03, 2004) A new bridge was constructed at a cost of about 90 million rupees, but that partially collapsed in August 2004. No casualties occurred. The collapse was attributed to heavy flooding on river Damanganga.Ervell E. Menezes, \\"Lotus of the marshlands\\", The Tribune (31 July 2005) Now the new bridge, known as Rajeev Gandhi Setu for Heavy Vehicles, has been completed, and the old bridges are to be kept closed forever.  Education  In Daman, the most popular schools are Institute of Our Lady of F√°tima located in Moti Daman, Coast Guard Public School in Nani Daman, Sarvajanik Vidyalaya in Nani Daman, Shri Macchi Mahajan High School in Nani Daman, and other government institutions.

Giladi Village,) is a kibbutz in the Galilee Panhandle of northern Israel. Located south of Metula on the Naftali Mountains above the Hula Valley and along the Lebanese border, it falls under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. In it had a population of . History Kibbutz Giladi was founded in 1916 by members of Hashomer on land owned by the Jewish Colonization Association. It was named after Israel Giladi, one of the founders of the Hashomer movement. The area was subject to intermittent border adjustments between the British and the French, and in 1919, the British relinquished the northern section of the Upper Galilee containing Tel Hai, Metula, Hamra, and Kfar Giladi to the French jurisdiction. After the Arab attack on Tel Hai in 1920, it was temporarily abandoned. Ten months later, the settlers returned. Several older buildings stand on the kibbutz that memorialize previous battles on the site, before and during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Between 1916 and 1932, the population totaled 40‚Äì70. In 1932, the kibbutz absorbed 100 newcomers, mainly young immigrants. From 1922 to 1948, between 8,000‚Äì10,000 Jewish immigrants were smuggled into Palestine through Kibbutz Giladi, circumventing the Mandatory ban on Jewish immigration. The immigrants came from Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eastern Europe. In an operation known as Mivtzah HaElef, 1,300 Jewish children were smuggled out of Syria between 1945 and 1948. At the kibbutz, the children were dressed in work clothes and hidden in the kibbutz chicken coops and cowsheds. In August 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, twelve reserve IDF soldiers were killed after being hit by a Katyusha rocket launched by Hezbollah from Southern Lebanon. The group of artillery gunners were gathering on the kibbutz in preparation for action in the conflict.

Archaeology An archaeological site at Kfar Giladi was excavated in 1957 and 1962.Kaplan, J., Kfar Giladi, Israel Exploration Journal, 8:274, 1958 It revealed remains four stages of occupation in different periods. An early neolithic stage was suggested to date between 6400 and 5800 BC. Finds included Dark faced burnished ware with incisions and rope patterns. Flints included axes, adzes, arrowheads and denticulated sickle blade elements. Similar finds were located in a later neolithic stage including a female clay figurine dating between 5800 and 5400 BC. Two later periods of occupation were attributed to chalcolithic occupations similar to Wadi Rabah. Another nearby neolithic site was excavated in 1973. They found Byblos points and tips of Jericho points and Amuq points, polished cutting axes, chisels and fine-toothed sickles. Finds were similar to Tell Ramad.

Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating for use as a protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust. The salt spray test is one of the most widespread and long-established corrosion tests. ASTM B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939. Other important relevant standards are ISO9227, JIS Z 2371 and ASTM G85.  Application  Salt spray testing is popular because it is relatively inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although there may be a weak correlation between the duration in salt spray test and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot-dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated corrosion test, the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches. The principal application of the salt spray test is, therefore, enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason, the salt spray test is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, it can be used to check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part. The salt spray test has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. Cyclic corrosion testing is better suited to this.  Testing equipment  A salt spray cabinet The apparatus for testing consists of a closed testing cabinet/chamber, where a salt water (5% NaCl) solution is atomized by means of spray nozzle(s) using pressurized air. This produces a corrosive environment of dense salt water fog (also referred to as a mist or spray) in the chamber, so that test samples exposed to this environment are subjected to severely corrosive conditions. Chamber volumes vary from supplier to supplier. If there is a minimum volume required by a particular salt spray test standard, this will be clearly stated and should be complied with. There is a general historical consensus that larger chambers can provide a more homogeneous testing environment. Variations to the salt spray test solutions depend upon the materials to be tested. The most common test for steel based materials is the Neutral Salt Spray test (often abbreviated to NSS) which reflects the fact that this type of test solution is prepared to a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.2. Results are represented generally as testing hours in NSS without appearance of corrosion products (e.g. 720 h in NSS according to ISO 9227). Synthetic seawater solutions are also commonly specified by some companies and standards. Other test solutions have other chemicals added including acetic acid (often abbreviated to ASS) and acetic acid with copper chloride (often abbreviated to CASS) each one chosen for the evaluation of decorative coatings, such as electroplated copper-nickel-chromium, electroplated copper-nickel or anodized aluminum. These acidified test solutions generally have a pH of 3.1 to 3.3 Some sources do not recommend using ASS or CASS test cabinets interchangeably for NSS tests, due to the risk of cross-contamination. It is claimed that a thorough cleaning of the cabinet after CASS test is very difficult. ASTM does not address this issue, but ISO 9227 does not recommend it and if it is to be done, advocates a thorough cleaning. Although the majority of salt spray tests are continuous, i.e.; the samples under test are exposed to the continuous generation of salt fog for the entire duration of the test, a few do not require such exposure. Such tests are commonly referred to as modified salt spray tests. ASTM G85 is an example of a test standard which contains several modified salt spray tests which are variations to the basic salt spray test.  Modified Salt Spray Tests  ASTM G85 is the most popular global test standard covering modified salt spray tests. There are five such tests altogether, referred to in ASTM G85 as annexes A1 through to A5.A modified salt spray chamber in use Many of these modified tests originally arose within particular industry sector, in order to address the need for a corrosion test capable of replicating the effects of naturally occurring corrosion and accelerate these effects. This acceleration arises through the use of chemically altered salt spray solutions, often combined with other test climates and in most cases, the relatively rapid cycling of these test climates over time. Although popular in certain industries, modified salt spray testing has in many cases been superseded by cyclic corrosion testing (CCT) The type of environmental test chambers used for modified salt spray testing to ASTM G85 are generally similar to the chambers used for testing to ASTM B117, but will often have some additional features, such as an automatic climate cycling control system. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 1 ASTM G85 Annex A1 ‚Äì Acetic Acid Salt Spray Test (non-cyclic) This test can be used to determine the relative resistance to corrosion of decorative chromium plating on steel and zinc based die casting when exposed to an acetic acid salt spray climate at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as an ASS test. Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber and exposed to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (pH 3.1‚Äì3.3) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour, in a chamber temperature of 35 ¬∞C. This climate is maintained under constant steady state conditions. The test duration is variable. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 2 ASTM G85 Annex A2 ‚Äì Acidified Salt Fog Test (cyclic). This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of aluminium alloys when exposed to a changing climate of acetic acid salt spray, followed by air drying, followed by high humidity, all at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as a MASTMAASIS test. Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate that comprises the following 3 part repeating cycle. 0.75 hours exposure to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (pH 2.8‚Äì3.0) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour. This is followed by a 2 hour exposure to an air drying (purge) climate. This is followed by 3.25 hours exposure to a high humidity climate which gradually rises to between 65% RH and 95% RH. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of 49 ¬∞C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 3 ASTM G85 Annex A3 ‚Äì Seawater Acidified Test (cyclic) This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of coated or uncoated aluminium alloys and other metals, when exposed to a changing climate of acidified synthetic seawater spray, followed by a high humidity, both at an elevated temperature. This test is also referred to as a SWAAT test. Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate that comprises the following 2 part repeating cycle. First, a 30 minute exposure to a continuous indirect spray of synthetic seawater solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (pH 2.8‚Äì3.0) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour. This is followed by a 90 minute exposure to a high humidity climate (above 98% RH). The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of 49 ¬∞C (may be reduced to 24‚Äì35 ¬∞C for organically coated specimens). The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable. Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 4A An example of modified salt spray test ASTM G85 annex A4 ‚Äì SO2 Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex A4 ‚Äì Salt Spray Test (cyclic) This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of product samples that are likely to encounter a combined /salt spray/acid rain environment during their usual service life. Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to 1 of 2 possible changing climate cycles. In either case, the exposure to salt spray may be salt water spray or synthetic sea water prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard. The most appropriate test cycle and spray solutions are to be agreed between parties. The first climate cycle comprises a continuous indirect spray of neutral (pH 6.5‚Äì7.2) salt water/synthetic seawater solution, which falls-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour. During this spraying, the chamber is dosed with gas at a rate of 35 cm¬≥/minute/m¬≥ of chamber volume, for 1 hour in every 6 hours of spraying. The entire test cycle is at a constant chamber temperature of 35 ¬∞C. The number of cycle repeats and therefore the test duration is variable. The second climate cycle comprises 0.5 hours of continuous indirect spray of neutral (pH 6.5‚Äì7.2) salt water/synthetic seawater solution, which falls-out on to the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour. This is followed by 0.5 hours of dosing with gas at a rate of 35 cm¬≥/minute/m¬≥ of chamber volume. This is followed by 2 hours of high humidity soak.

Graph showing the temperature & humidity steps required during modified Salt Spray Test ASTM G85 Annex 5 ASTM G85 Annex A5 ‚Äì Dilute Electrolyte Salt Fog/Dry Test (cyclic) This test can be used to test the relative resistance to corrosion of paints on steel when exposed to a changing climate of dilute salt spray at ambient temperature, followed by air drying at elevated temperature. It is a popular test in the surface coatings industry, where it is also referred to as the PROHESION‚Ñ¢ test. Test specimens are placed in an enclosed chamber, and exposed to a changing climate with the following 2-part cycle. First, a 1-hour exposure to a continuous indirect spray of salt water solution, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the test standard and acidified (pH 3.1‚Äì3.3) by the addition of acetic acid. This spray is set to fall on the specimens at a rate of 1‚Äì2 ml/80 cm¬≤/hour, in an ambient chamber temperature (21‚Äì27 ¬∞C). This is followed by a 1-hour exposure to an air drying (purge) climate at 35 ¬∞C. The cycle repeats until the desired duration has been achieved.  Standardization  Electroplated and yellow chromated bolt with white corrosion Zinc flake coated bolt with red rust after testing Chamber construction, testing procedure and testing parameters are standardized under national and international standards, such as ASTM B 117 and ISO 9227. These standards describe the necessary information to carry out this test; testing parameters such as temperature, air pressure of the sprayed solution, preparation of the spraying solution, concentration, pH, etc. Daily checking of testing parameters is necessary to show compliance with the standards, so records shall be maintained accordingly. ASTM B117 and ISO 9227 are widely used as reference standards. Testing cabinets are manufactured according to the specified requirements here. However, these testing standards neither provide information of testing periods for the coatings to be evaluated, nor the appearance of corrosion products in form of salts. Requirements are agreed between customer and manufacturer. In the automotive industry requirements are specified under material specifications. Different coatings have different behavior in salt spray test and consequently, test duration will differ from one type of coating to another. For example, a typical electroplated zinc and yellow passivated steel part lasts 96 hours in salt spray test without white rust. Electroplated zinc-nickel steel parts can last more than 720 hours in NSS test without red rust (or 48 hours in CASS test without red rust) Requirements are established in test duration (hours) and coatings shall comply with minimum testing periods. Artificial seawater which is sometimes used for Salt Spray Testing can be found at ASTM International. The standard for Artificial Seawater is ASTM D1141-98 which is the standard practice for the preparation of substitute ocean water.  Uses  Typical coatings that can be evaluated with this method are: *Phosphated (pre-treated) surfaces (with subsequent paint/primer/lacquer/rust preventive) *Zinc and zinc-alloy plating (see also electroplating). See ISO 4042 for guidance *Electroplated chromium, nickel, copper, tin *Coatings not applied electrolytically, such as zinc flake coatings according to ISO 10683 *Organic coatings, such as rust preventives *Paint Coating Hot-dip galvanized surfaces are not generally tested in a salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). Hot-dip galvanizing produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a hot-dip galvanized specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for hot-dip galvanized specimens. Painted surfaces with an underlying hot-dip galvanized coating can be tested according to this method. See ISO 12944-6. Testing periods range from a few hours (e.g. 8 or 24 hours of phosphated steel) to more than a month (e.g. 720 hours of zinc-nickel coatings, 1000 hours of certain zinc flake coatings).

Diu District is the tenth least populated district of India. The town of Diu lies at the eastern end of Diu Island and is known for its fortress and old Portuguese cathedral. It is a fishing town. The city is one of the hundred Indian cities competing in a national level competition to get the funds under Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission. Diu will be competing for the one of last 10 spots against 20 cities from across India. In April 2018, it was reported that the Diu Smart City has already become India's first city to run on 100 percent renewable energy during the daytime.  History  Diu town and the Portuguese fort (British engraving, 1729) An allegory of the Second Siege of Diu, in 1546 The town and district were historically part of the Saurashtra region of Gujarat and an important port on trade routes of Arabian sea of Indian Ocean. Due to its strategic importance, there was a Battle of Diu in 1509 between Portugal and a combined force of Mamluks, Venetians, the Ragusians, the Zamorin of Calicut, and the Sultan of Gujarat, Mahmud Begada. In 1513, the Portuguese tried to establish an outpost, but negotiations were unsuccessful. There were failed attempts by Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1521 and Nuno da Cunha in 1523. In 1531 the conquest attempted by D. Nuno da Cunha was not successful. In 1535 Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, concluded a defensive alliance with the Portuguese against the Mughal emperor Humayun and allowed the Portuguese to construct the Diu Fort and maintain a garrison on the island. The alliance quickly unraveled, and attempts by the Sultans to oust the Portuguese from Diu between 1537 and 1546 failed. Repenting his generosity, Bahadur Shah sought to recover Diu but was defeated and killed by the Portuguese, followed by a period of war between them and the people of Gujarat. In 1538, Coja Sofar, lord of Cambay, together with the Ottoman Suleiman Pasha, came to lay siege to Diu and were defeated by Portuguese resistance led by Anthony Silveira. A second siege was imposed by the same Coja Sofar in 1546. It was repelled by the Portuguese conquerors, led on land by D. John Mascarenhas and at sea by D. Jo√£o de Castro. Coja Sofar and D. Fernando de Castro, son of the Portuguese viceroy, perished in the struggle. The fortress, completed by Dom Jo√£o de Castro after the siege of 1545, still stands. After this second siege, Diu was so fortified that it could withstand later attacks of the Arabs of Muscat and the Dutch in the late 17th century. From the 18th century, Diu declined in strategic importance (due to development of Bombay) and was reduced to a museum or historical landmark as commercial and strategic bulwark in the struggle between the forces of the Islamic East and Christian West. Diu remained in the possession of the Portuguese from 1535 until 1961, when it fell in the possession of the troops of the Indian Union, which invaded all of former Portuguese India under Operation Vijay. The island was occupied by the Indian military on 19 December 1961. The Battle of Diu involved overwhelming land, sea and air strikes on the enclave for 48 hours until the Portuguese garrison there surrendered. It was declared a union territory of India, Goa, Daman, and Diu. Goa separated as a state in 1987; the remainder became union territory of Daman and Diu. On 26 January 2020, the union territories of Daman and Diu was merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli to form the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Diu in the early 17th century (in Braun et Hogenberg, 1600)  Population  Street view of Diu  Languages  The languages spoken in Diu include Gujarati, Portuguese, English and Hindi.  Demographics  India census, Diu had a population of 21,576. Males constituted 46% of the population and females 54%. Diu has an average literacy rate of 71%, falling below the 2011 national average of 74.04%. Male literacy is 81% and female literacy is 69%. In Diu, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Geography and climate  St. Paul's Church, Diu Diu Fort Naida Caves, near Jalandhar Beach Gangeshwar Temple Diu is at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Diu The island is at sea level and covers an area of 38.8 km¬≤. Diu has a hot semi- arid climate (BSh), with an average annual rainfall of 560 mm, falling mostly from June and September. Attractions With no tall buildings except the fort, Diu has a characteristically low skyline. Old Diu is known for its Portuguese architecture. Diu Fort was built in 1535 and maintained an active garrison until 1960. The Diu fort is the most visited landmark in the district. The fort and the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa were chosen as the two wonders from India, among the seven from across the world, out of a list of 27 monuments built in 16 countries during the Portuguese rule. The fort is built on a hillock next to the sea. There are only remains now, but the fort must have been a very romantic place. There are three Portuguese Baroque churches, with St Paul‚Äôs Church, completed in 1610, being the only one in use for its original purpose. The Church of St Francis of Assisi (the first church built in Diu, in 1593) is now used as a hospital. St Thomas Church is used as a museum. An ancient Lord Shiva temple is on the Gangeswar coast. Naida Caves are near Jalandhar Beach, at 1km distance from the city center via Hadmitya road. The entry to Naida caves is free. The caves' origin remains a mystery as it is believed that they were formed by geological forces or due to quarrying done by the Portuguese. Naida caves create a natural sunlight show which sparkles big orange rocks. A labyrinth-like structure gives it a mesmerizing beauty which is a paradise for nature lovers and photographers. Caves are open for 24 hours though security personnel may sometime deny the entry at night after 5:30 pm as the inside of the caves become much darker. INS Khukri or Khukri memorial is near Chakratirth Beach. It is known for its open amphitheatre and sunset shots. The nearby Nagoa beach and offshore lighthouse are popular tourist destinations, and the coast is a popular recreational area for parasailing, boating and jet skiing. Off late water sports activities are suspended by the authorities. Dinosaur park with life size Dinosaur structures and large play area for kids right on the bay. Bird watching sanctuary. Sea Shell Museum, Summer House. Lovers Point. There are several hotels and resorts and there is a growing hotel and leisure industry. Unlike in Gujarat State, alcohol is legal in Diu.

However. portions of the mountain, including approximately of northwestern Cold Mountain in Panther Branch, are privately owned. There are about 15 residences on the northwest side of mountain and maintenance of access roads is funded by property owners. In 2016 the Southern Appalachian Highland Conservancy purchased the Dix Creek tract from private owners. The land was transferred to the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission in late October 2016 and will increase the adjoining Cold Mountain Game Lands to in 2017. History Much of the Forest was originally owned by George Washington Vanderbilt II, builder of the Biltmore Estate. After his death, his widow sold the land that included the mountain to the United States Forest Service at $5 an acre to help create the Pisgah National Forest as the first National Forest in the eastern United States. Major General Paul Wurtsmith was killed along with four other crewmen when the TB-25J Mitchell he was piloting (c/n 44-30227) crashed below the summit of Cold Mountain on September 16, 1946. Wurtsmith Air Force Base was renamed in memorial in 1953. Lt. Col. F. L. Trickey, Lt. Col. P. R. Okerbloom, Master Sergeant Hosey W. Merritt, and Staff Sergeant Hoyt W. Crump were also killed in the crash. In April 1989 the engines from the crashed bomber were airlifted from the crash site and returned to Wurtsmith AFB by a small volunteer group of base personnel with the intent of creating a memorial for the crewmen. Due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances, that included a previous fatal KC-135 crash in October 1988, the transfer and retirement of the volunteers, the Gulf war, and the 1993 closure of the base, the planned memorial to Gen Wurtsmith and those who were killed in the 1946 crash was never realized and the fate of the engines is not known. However, in 2006 Veteran Memorial Park of Northeast Michigan was created at an existing flag circle on the former base. In popular culture The mountain and the township Community of Bethel area outside of Canton near the base of Cold Mountain was made famous as the story location in the 1997 novel Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. Contrary to popular belief, there has never been a village or town called Cold Mountain nor a settlement on the real-life mountain. The peak is accessible only by hiking a spur of the strenuous Art Loeb Trail. A major motion picture based on the novel was distributed by Miramax Films in 2003. The movie was actually filmed in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. A Miramax Films spokesperson cited higher production costs however director Anthony Minghella had said that the lack of old-growth forests and period buildings as well as the lack of dependable snowfall were the primary reasons he chose not to film in Western North Carolina.

Too radical even for other supporters of the Vichy regime, it was granted its independence in January 1943, after Operation Torch and the German occupation of the South Zone, until then dubbed \\"Free Zone\\" and controlled by Vichy. Pierre Laval himself (supported by Marshal Philippe P√©tain) passed the law which accorded the SOL its independence and transformed it into the Milice, which participated in battles alongside the Nazis against the Resistance and committed numerous war crimes against civilians. After the Liberation, some members of the Milice escaped to Germany, where they joined the ranks of the SS. Those who stayed behind in France faced either drumhead courts-martial, generally followed by summary execution, or simple lynching at the hands of r√©sistants and enraged civilians. Creation of the SOL Joseph Darnand, who had taken part in the Cagoule fascist group's conspiracy before the Invasion of Poland, had been one of the first to rally himself to the \\"National Revolution\\" ‚Äì which was the name given to the new Vichy regime issued from the 1940 defeat during the Battle of France and from the July 10, 1940 vote according extraordinary powers to Marshal P√©tain. Joseph Darnand took the head of the L√©gion fran√ßaise des combattants (LFC) in the Alpes Maritimes region, and then created the SOL, which attracted not only the most enthusiast proponents of collaborationism with Nazi Germany, but also criminals from the Nice mafia. The SOL was extended to all of the South Zone and to North Africa on December 12, 1941. This new organization was headed by Darnand, Pierre Gallet, Marcel Gombert and Jean Bassompierre, whereas its program was defined by Bassompierre, No√´l de Tissot and the docteur Durandy. It advocated the cult of the leader, anti-parliamentarism, racism and anti-Semitism, as well as pushing for collaboration with the Nazis. Before the 1941-1942 turn of public opinion, France was mostly composed of p√©tainistes, who supported Marshal P√©tain. However, various grades of collaborationism must be distinguished, as some advocated it claiming it would lighten the burden of the military occupation (this was P√©tain's official discourse) and that Marshal P√©tain, a figure highly respected for his role during the 1916 Battle of Verdun, couldn't be wrong. These collaborationist have been called Mar√©chalistes, as their support of the collaboration was rather based on trust towards P√©tain. After his meeting with Hitler, P√©tain had advocated collaboration in an October 30, 1940 speech to the radio. Others, commonly called p√©tainistes, advocated collaboration on ideological grounds: they supported Vichy's anti- Semitic laws which the regime had put in place on its own, without waiting for German orders. Joseph Darnand and the SOL, were at the spearhead of these ideological collaborationists, eagerly hoping for German victory in the war Several leaders and SOL activists engaged themselves in brutal actions against imaginary or real opponents of Vichy, and started a wave of denouncement which did not even spare the civil or religious authorities of the Etat fran√ßais (name by which the Vichy regime called itself). Joseph Darnand, who headed the SOL, had based himself in Vichy. He was always supported by P√©tain even in his more extreme cries in support to Collaboration. Darnand went so far that his \\"patriotism\\" came to be seen as treason, and shocked even others leaders of the L√©gion or of the Chantiers de jeunesse (Youth Workshops) which were also in favor of Collaboration, but done in a \\"civilized\\" manner. Thus, it was decided to grant autonomy to the SOL on January 5, 1943, in order to take distance with the militia and at the same time grant it complete freedom of action. Operation Torch and transformation of the SOL into the Milice Following the November 1942 Operation Torch and the landing in North Africa, which led to the German occupation of the South zone, until now designed as the \\"free zone\\" because it was under Vichy's authority, Marshal P√©tain exalted in his January 5, 1943 discourse the \\"patriotism\\" of the SOL which, along with the Arm√©e d'Afrique, had fired on the American troops. In reality, only several dozens of SOL militia had fought in Oran and in Morocco, whereas in Algiers all of the SOL militia had surrendered to the Allies during the \\"November 8, 1942 putsch\\", during which 400 poorly equipped Resistance fighters single-handedly immobilised the XIXth Corps d'Arm√©e vichyste for 15 hours, contributing to the immediate success of the Allies' landing in Algiers. Thus, on January 5, 1943, the SOL was granted autonomy and transformed into the Milice fran√ßaise (French Militia), created by a law issued by Pierre Laval under agreements with P√©tain.

As per the custom of the day, his father had three wives. Harish Mukherjee was son of the third wife Rukmini Devi. He was a free student at Union School but had to give up studies because of poverty. He started working in a small firm but later found employment, through competitive examinations, as a clerk in the office of the Military Auditor General. He gradually rose to a high position in that office and worked there all his life.Sastri, Sivanath, Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj, 1903/2001, pp129-130, New Age Publishers Pvt. Ltd. In 1852, he became a member of British Indian Association and soon became one of the members of its think-tank. He was one of the founders of the Bhowanipur Brahmo Samaj. Hindu Patriot A self-taught person he attained proficiency in history, politics, law and English. He severely criticised the government in such newspapers as Hindu Intelligencer edited by Kashiprasad Ghosh and The Bengal Recorder edited by Ramgopal Ghosh. He was associated with the Hindu Patriot right form its start in 1853. In 1855, he secured the ownership and became the editor of the newspaper. Sambhunath Pandit used to write articles on legal matters in it. When the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 struck, the political reaction in Bengal was not well defined. \\"There were, however, bold adventurers who could perceive dimly the inevitable trend in India‚Äôs political evolution.\\"Sengupta, Nitish, History of the Bengali-speaking People, p285, UBS Publishers‚Äô Distributors Pvt. Ltd., . He wrote in the Hindu Patriot, \\"The time is nearly come when all Indian questions must be solved by Indians. The mutinies have made patent to the English public what must be the effects of politics in which the native is allowed no voice.\\" After his death in 1861, Hindu Patriot was badly in want of resources, when Kaliprasanna Singha bought the magazine and saved it from extinction. Kaliprasanna initially handed over management of the magazine to Shambhu Chandra Mookerjee. Hindu Patriot was edited for 23 years by Krishnadas Pal.Sengupta, Subodh and Bose, Anjali, p104. Revolt of indigo cultivators Indigo cultivation had been greatly increased from the 18th century. The cultivators were forced to undertake indigo cultivation for which they hardly got anything in return. The oppression gradually increased and when the cultivators could no longer bear it they revolted and refused to undertake indigo cultivation. It was then that the intelligentsia in Kolkata took up the matter. Harish Mukherjee played a vital pioneering role in that movement with his brilliant writing in the Hindu Patriot. His writing roused public opinion and finally Dinabandhu Mitra came out with his play Nil Darpan in 1860. The indigo planters wanted to throttle the Hindu Patriot first. The case fell through because Bhowanipur was outside the jurisdiction of the English Supreme Court then functioning in Kolkata. So great was the wrath of the indigo planters that even after his death, they wanted to punish his widow with court cases. Subsequently, James Long was jailed but the net benefit was the setting up of an Indigo Enquiry Commission by the government that went into the entire problem. It did not solve the problem but put in some checks on the untold misery. The fallout of overwork during the period killed Harish Mukherjee in 1861. He died aged 37.

The whole Jewish population was killed in a single day,(tzom-gedalia), after the entry of the Germans into the city. This is the town from which the Cauliflower Revolution originated. Names The names of the town as it is called or was formerly called in other languages spoken by non-Lithuanian ethnic groups which have lived or live in or around the town include: ; ; . Other spelling variants include Vilkavishkis and Wilkowyszki.Jewish Gen, ShtetLinks, \\"VILKOVISHK, Lithuania\\" History Roman Catholic Diocese of Vilkavi≈°kis German units in the town during World War II Old coat of arms The town was granted city rights in 1670 by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jan Kazimierz, which was one of the first times such privileges were granted to a place in Lithuania. The coat of arms of the town was most likely borrowed from the Pac family, as the owner of the village at the time, Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac, was also the Chancellor of Lithuania. It remained in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795 when, in the First Partition of Poland it became part of Kingdom of Prussia (the region in which the town is located was split between Prussia and Russia) until 1807. At this time the town was incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw and merged into the Bia≈Çystok region. After Napoleon's defeat in 1815 the region switched hands again and became part of Russia, and then Congress Poland, as part of the August√≥w, and later Suwa≈Çki, district. In 1856, the vast majority of the town's population was Jewish, with 4,417 Jews and 834 Christians. During World War I the town was captured by German forces and held until 1918, when the place became part of independent Lithuania. During the interwar period a rail line was constructed running through nearby Marijampolƒó which caused that town to become the regional center, replacing Vilkavi≈°kis in its traditional role. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II the control of the area fell to the Soviets, between 1940 and 1941, on the basis of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. In 1941 Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, invaded Lithuania, and occupied the town. Between June and September 1941, the Germans, along with Lithuanian collaborators, destroyed almost all the houses in the town and murdered more than 3000 people, most of them Jews. The city was the scene of a successful counter-attack by the German Panzer-Grenadier- Division Gro√üdeutschland in the autumn of 1944 and the aftermath of the fighting was the scene of several propaganda photographs in which the name of the town was prominently featured.Spaeter, Helmuth History of the Panzerkorps Gro√üdeutschland Volume 3 The town was captured by the Red Army in August 1944. After the war, it was part of the Lithuanian SSR within the Soviet Union.Joseph Rosin, English edited by Sarah and Mordechai Kopfstein, \\"Vilkovishk (Vilkaviskis)\\", When Lithuania regained its independence in 1991, the town became the capital of the newly established Vilkavi≈°kis district municipality.

It was a Roman Catholic missionary jurisdiction of a Vicar Apostolic in predominantly Protestant Northern Europe. On 7 August 1868, on the occasion of completing separate jurisdictions for all of Scandinavia, the vicariate only continued to comprise small areas in Northern Germany and was thus renamed. With the integration of these areas into other Roman Catholic dioceses the vicariate ceased to exist on 13 August 1930. History The Reformation in the 16th century caused the Roman Catholic Church to lose almost all of Northern Europe. In 1582 the stray Catholics of Denmark, Finland, Northern Germany, Norway, and Sweden were placed under the jurisdiction of an Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne. The Congregation de propaganda fide, on its establishment in 1622, took charge of the vast missionary field, which at its third session it divided among the nuncio of Brussels (for the Catholics in Denmark and Norway), the nuncio at Cologne (much of Northern Germany) and the nuncio of Poland (Finland, Mecklenburg, and Sweden). Following the organisational structure of the Church the apostolic vicariate included the diocesan areas of bishoprics, where Roman Catholic jurisdiction had effectively been abolished (see the list in section Dioceses comprised in the vicariate). This was partially due to (1) secular rulers or governments repressing Catholic faith and clergy in their territories, which comprised the diocesan areas, (2) due to the fact that incumbent bishops had converted to Lutheranism, or (3) because the cathedral capitular canons, responsible for electing new bishops, had adopted Lutheranism and thus chose fellow faithful candidates, who thus de facto ascended the sees (typical for prince-bishoprics in Northern Germany). So while the area under the jurisdiction of the vicar apostolic followed originally the diocesan boundaries of the de facto defunct bishoprics, the boundaries of new jurisdictions followed mostly the political borders relevant at the time of their establishment (See the list in the section States and territories covered by the vicariate below). The scattered Catholics in Northern Europe were placed under the pastoral care of the Jesuits, Franciscans and Dominicans. Catholics in many places had at their disposal only the chapels established in the houses of the diplomatic representatives of the Holy Roman (becoming ‚Äì as of 1806 ‚Äì the Austrian) Emperor and of other Catholic Powers, France and Spain. Sometimes admission even to these chapels was rendered difficult, or entirely prohibited to native Catholics. In some districts the conversion of the monarchs, e.g. Duke John Frederick of Brunswick and Lunenburg, Prince of Calenberg (1651) and Duke Christian I Louis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1663), brought Catholics some measure of freedom. The number of Catholics having increased in 1667, chiefly through the above-mentioned Prince of Calenberg, a vicariate Apostolic was established for Northern Germany. The first vicar was Valerio Maccioni, titular Bishop of Morocco, who resided at Hanover. He died in 1676, and was succeeded by the celebrated Danish convert Nicolaus Steno, who in 1680 was obliged to leave Hanover, was made Auxiliary Bishop of M√ºnster, and in 1683 returned to the Nordic Missions. He died at Schwerin in 1686, and was followed in the vicariate successively by Friedrich von H√∂rde, Auxiliary Bishop of Hildesheim and titular Bishop of Joppe (1686‚Äì96), Jobst Edmund von Brabeck, Bishop of Hildesheim (1697‚Äì1702) and Otto von Bronckhorst, Auxiliary Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. The Northern Missions, viewed in a wider sense, included also the Apostolic Prefectures of Schleswig-Holstein, coinciding with the Prussian province of that name, of Denmark and of Norway, which were placed under separate prelates in 1868. The vicariate and prefectures were under the permanent jurisdiction of the Bishop of Osnabr√ºck as administrator Apostolic. In the vicariate, corresponding mostly to the Prussian province of Schleswig- Holstein, Catholics numbered about 79,400 (with 1,925,000 members of other confessional denominations), under 47 secular priests having care of 17 parishes and 17 mission stations. The following religious congregations had houses in the vicariate: Sisters of Mercy of St. Charles Borromeo, 1; Sisters of St. Elizabeth (Grey Nuns), 5; Franciscan Sisters, 2; Ursulines, 2. The Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein had in 1909: 11 parishes, 31 mission stations, 34 secular priests, 35,900 Catholics, and 550,000 of other beliefs; 4 communities of Sisters of St. Elizabeth and 3 of Franciscan nuns. In summer the Catholic population in the vicariate of Northern Germany and prefecture of Schleswig-Holstein was increased by 17,000 to 20,000 labourers (chiefly Poles) from other parts of Germany, who returned to their homes at the beginning of the winter. The spiritual interests of the faithful were inadequately attended to owing to the extent of the parishes, the lack of priests, the poverty of the majority of the Catholics and in many places the hostility of the Protestant state or municipal governments. A more encouraging picture was presented by the numerous Catholic societies and by the maintenance of private Catholic schools, despite the fact that the Catholics were often obliged to contribute also to the support of the state and Protestant parish schools. A very fruitful activity has been developed in these missions by the Boniface Association. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic regime brought great relief to Catholics in many cities and states; but the equality granted them by law in some countries was often merely theoretical. At the reorganisation of Catholic affairs in Germany after the Napoleonic era (see Rheinbund), the greater part of the Northern Missions was added to adjacent bishoprics. The only districts remaining mission territory were the Kingdom of Saxony, the Principality of Anhalt, constituted separate vicariates Apostolic in 1816 and 1825 respectively, and the North, which in 1826 was placed temporarily under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Paderborn. In 1839 Pope Gregory XVI wished to entrust the vicariate to a bishop with his see at Hamburg. Johann Theodor Laurent was appointed vicar and consecrated bishop. Lutheran opposition prevented the realisation of the plan and Laurent was denied to enter Hamburg. The pope thereupon gave the administration of the vicariate to the Auxiliary Bishop of Osnabr√ºck, (d. 1855). The Bishop of Osnabr√ºck has since then been the regular Vicar Apostolic of the Northern Missions, and administrator of the Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein since its separation from the vicariate in 1868. In 1869 Denmark and Norway were erected into apostolic prefectures of their own, and in 1892 into apostolic vicariates. Defunct dioceses comprised in the vicariate On its establishment the Apostolic Vicariate comprised first only the Diocese of Minden. The other former Catholic dioceses followed at three later dates (given in the list). The date in the second column refers to the year, when last time a catholic bishop could effectively wield his pontificate, not an eventual later appointment or continued titulature in exile. Some last Catholic bishops (like in Minden and Verden) had already been preceded by Lutheran incumbents. The list below records the bishoprics whose diocesan areas fell under the jurisdiction of the Nordic Missions (renamed into Nordic Missions of Northern Germany on 7 August 1868 on the occasion of completing separate jurisdictions for all of Scandinavia). The list shows when the various diocesan areas left the (and eventually returned to the) jurisdiction of the Nordic Missions, to which Roman Catholic jurisdictions the areas used to belong afterwards, and to which jurisdictions they belong today. Today the areas of some defunct dioceses are partitioned among several modern dioceses. By clicking on the buttons the list can be ordered along the categories given in each column. The list does not claim to record the correct affiliations for every area of the former dioceses. { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" width=\\"100%\\" - class=\\"hintergrundfarbe5\\" ! width = \\"6%\\"  Diocese (D)/ Archdiocese (A) ! width = \\"2%\\"  Last Catholic episcopate ended in ! width = \\"10%\\"  Jurisdiction by Northern Missions ! width = \\"30%\\"  Later jurisdiction(s) (Apostolic Administration/ ~ Prefecture/ ~ Vicariate = AA/AP/AV; territorial prelature = TP) ! width = \\"30%\\"  Today's jurisdiction(s) ! width = \\"15\\"  Pre-Reformation ecclesiastical province; remarks -

So the table below tries to present those states and territories which were part of the vicariate before it was territorially reduced for the first time on 6 April 1709. Owing to its vast extent, Pope Clement XI divided the old Vicariate Apostolic into two vicariates: the Vicariate Apostolic of Upper and Lower Saxony, embracing the portions of the old vicariate situated in the Palatinate and in Lower Saxon Electoral Hanover and the Duchy of Bremen (with the Westphalian Principality of Verden), as well as in Upper Saxon Anhalt (in its then four princely subdivisions), Electoral Brandenburg (comprising the March of Brandenburg and Farther Pomerania), Swedish Hither Pomerania, and Electoral Saxony (still without the 1635-acquired Bohemian fief of Upper and Lower Lusatia). This new Apostolic Vicariate was seated in Hanover city (and thus also called Apostolic Vicariate of Hanover). It was placed in charge of Agostino Steffani, Bishop of Spiga and minister of the Elector Palatine, as vicar Apostolic. So the rest of the original vicariate, comprising all of Northern Europe north of the Elbe, and Bremen, remained with the Nordic Missions, which retained the title of Vicariate of the North. It was placed under the Auxiliary Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. Since 1743 the Roman Catholics in the Wettin-held imperial fief of Electorate of Saxony were subject to the Apostolic Vicariate of the Saxon Hereditary Lands, later also acceded by Reuss Elder Line, Reuss Younger Line, and Saxe- Altenburg. Saxon Hereditary Lands merged with the Apostolic Prefecture of Upper Lusatia (comprising the post-Napoleonic remainder of Wettin-held Upper Lusatia) into the new Diocese of Meissen on 24 June 1921. The division between the Nordic Missions and the Upper and Lower Saxon vicariate lasted until 1779/80, when Friedrich Wilhelm von Westphalen, Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim, reunited under his administration the vicariates. On 11 February 1780 the territorially lessened Vicariate of Upper and Lower Saxony remerged into the Nordic Missions. Three years later the Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden was established, then competent for Roman Catholics in the Swedish Empire with Finland and Sweden proper. The Swedish-held imperial fief in Hither Pomerania remained with the Nordic Missions, also after it became Prussian in 1815. With Pomerania and the March of Brandenburg having ceased to be parts of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, but become provinces of Prussia, the latter agreed with the Holy See to place the Prussian part of the Nordic Missions under the jurisdictions of neighbouring Prussian dioceses as of 16 August 1821. Thus the Prince-Bishop of Breslau took direct responsibility for the now Prussian-held part of Meissen's former diocesan areas in then Brandenburgian Lower Lusatia and then Silesian (eastern) Upper Lusatia. Breslau wielded its indirect jurisdiction in the remainder of Brandenburg (including Berlin) and most of Pomerania (except of Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land) by its new Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania (staffed in 1824). The diocesan areas of the defunct bishoprics in Prussian Saxony came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Paderborn, as was the case with the diocesan area of defunct Minden in Prussian Westphalia. Also in the Kingdom of Hanover the diocesan areas of defunct bishoprics (Bremen, Verden) were assigned to the neighbouring existing dioceses of Hildesheim and of Osnabr√ºck on 26 March 1824 (Bull \\"Impensa Romanorum Pontificum\\"). Also Brunswick (succeeding Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel) and meanwhile only tripartite Anhalt left the Nordic Missions in 1825, but without a persisting domestic Catholic diocese and only few domestic Catholics they formed an Apostolic Vicariate of their own, also acceded by Saxe-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. In 1834 Brunswick, leaving Anhalt apostolic vicariate, merged into the jurisdiction of neighbouring Hanoveran Hildesheim diocese and Norway, leaving the Nordic Missions, became part of the Swedish vicariate the same year. In 1855 northern Norway switched to the , while the rest of Norway remained with Sweden until 1868. At this time all of Northern Europe formed separate Roman Catholic jurisdictions and had left the Nordic Missions: * Apostolic Vicariate of Sweden (already est. on 23 September 1783) * Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mohilev (competent for Finland since the Russian takeover in 1809) * Apostolic Prefecture of Schleswig-Holstein (est. on 29 July 1868; however, yet without Saxe-Lauenburg, L√ºbeck free city and L√ºbeck principality), * Apostolic Prefecture of Denmark (est. on 7 August 1868; with Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland) * Apostolic Prefecture of Norway (est. on 7 August 1868) Simultaneously with the establishment of the Danish and Norwegian apostolic prefectures the Nordic Missions had been reduced to small member states in the North German Confederation (thus renamed to Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Germany on 7 August 1868), such as the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg (part of Prussia as of 1876), the Hanseatic free cities of Bremen (without Bremerhaven), Hamburg (still with Cuxhaven) and L√ºbeck, the Principalities of L√ºbeck (capital Eutin), and Schaumburg-Lippe, and the British Island of Helgoland (joined Germany in 1891). The table below shows the territories and states at the beginning of the 18th century and how new jurisdictions developed over the centuries.

An Australia national and New South Wales state representative front-row forward, he captained the national team in two Tests against New Zealand in 1963 and who captained-coached a number of his club sides during a record length career played at the top-grade for twenty seasons from 1948 to 1967. Much of his New South Wales Rugby League premiership career was spent with Sydney's St. George club where he was a pivotal member of that club in the first half of their 11-year consecutive premiership run from 1956 to 1966. Billy Wilson won six premierships with the Dragons. Early career Wilson was a St. George junior, growing up in Blakehurst in Sydney. He was graded for the St. George club in 1948 as a centre/lock. Regularly during his early career Wilson would take up the financial opportunities offered to lead (as captain/coach) Country first division sides. In 1950 he and his wife Norma moved to Picton for that purpose from where he represented for Southern Division against the touring 1950 Great Britain side. In 1951 he was captain-coach at Baradine's club in northern New South Wales. Playing career St. George Dragons He returned to St George in 1952 cementing a regular first grade position from 1953 and he soon earned a reputation as a rugged enforcer and fierce protector of his teammates. In the final decider of 1953 against South Sydney he was sent-off by referee Darcy Lawler for fighting with South's Martin Gallagher. In 1954 he featured in the Dragon's semi-final win against North Sydney playing out the match with a broken arm, gashed eye and three broken ribs. He was instrumental in the 1956 Grand final where the Dragons victorious, commenced their long run. St George centre Merv Lees cracked his collar bone early in that match and Wilson moved out from the pack to play in the centres in spite of being constrained himself with a knee injury. Wilson tormented his Balmain Tigers opposition three-quarters in both attack and defence and set up both his own wingers for a number of long dashes. He was later selected by his teammates as Man of the Match. Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, 1995. He captain-coached Wagga in the Riverina competition in 1957 then returned to the St. George Dragons for five more premiership victories from 1958 to 1962. Wilson made his state debut for New South Wales in 1959 aged 32 against a touring New Zealand side and then debuted for Australia in the first Test against that same side, going on to play in all three Tests. He was then selected on the 1959 Kangaroo tour and played in 5 Tests and 14 minor tour matches. Billy Wislon is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 345.ARL Annual Report, 2005. page 54 The 1962 NSWRFL season's Grand final was Wilson's last for St. George, his sixth Grand Final victory and his role was infamous. Dragons captain Norm Provan was knocked out by Wests Jim Cody five minutes before half time. Cody escaped any official punishment but Provan was carried from the field and didn't return again until well into the second half. Wilson came out as captain after the break and after having told his players to keep things calm he apparently squared things up in the first seconds after kick-off before the first tackle was even made. The order of proceedings was unclear, but Cody went down and referee Jack Bradley sent Wilson off. With no replacements allowed in those days, St George were reduced to 11 men until Provan returned to the field 15 minutes later. From an interview with Wilson's wife Norma conducted in 1994, Larry Writer Larry Writer: Never Before, Never Again. 1995. () reports that Wilson felt enormously guilty about putting the team in this position and promptly retired after the match. Larry Writer himself suggests that the send-off may have soured Wilson's relationship with club officials in spite of the victory. These views aside, at 35 years of age, the end of Wilson's playing career was looming from the club's perspective and his contract was not renewed.Writer p298 As of the 2007 NRL season no forward since Wilson has been sent off in a Grand Final and in that game Wilson became the only man to have been sent off in two grand finals following his dismissal in 1953. North Sydney Bears In the twilight of his career aged 36 in 1963, with his new club, North Sydney Bears showing sparkling early-season form, Wilson was selected as captain for New South Wales in the interstate series against Queensland and then was honoured with the national captaincy for the domestic Test series of 1963 against New Zealand following injury to Arthur Summons. He set the record for being the oldest Australian Test captain (36 years and 23 days). After five seasons with the North Sydney Bears, Bluey Wilson retired in 1967, age 40, having set the record for longest Australian first grade career of any player (20 seasons).

Filmed in CinemaScope with color by DeLuxe, it was directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. It is based on Mika Waltari's 1945 novel of the same name and the screenplay was adapted by Philip Dunne and Casey Robinson. Leading roles were played by Edmund Purdom, Bella Darvi, Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, Gene Tierney, Peter Ustinov, and Michael Wilding. Cinematographer Leon Shamroy was nominated for an Oscar in 1955. Plot Sinuhe (Edmund Purdom), a struggling physician in 18th dynasty Egypt (14th century BC), is thrown by chance into contact with the pharaoh Akhnaton (Michael Wilding). He rises to and falls from great prosperity, wanders the world, and becomes increasingly drawn towards a new religion spreading throughout Egypt. His companions throughout are his lover, a shy tavern maid named Merit (Jean Simmons); and his corrupt but likable servant, Kaptah (Peter Ustinov). While out lion hunting with his sturdy friend Horemheb (Victor Mature), Sinuhe discovers Egypt's newly ascendant pharaoh Akhnaton, who has sought the solitude of the desert in the midst of a religious epiphany. While praying, the ruler is stricken with an epileptic seizure, with which Sinuhe is able to help him. The grateful Akhnaton makes his savior court physician and gives Horemheb a post in the Royal Guard, a career previously denied to him by low birth. His new eminence gives Sinuhe an inside look at Akhnaton's reign, which is made extraordinary by the ruler's devotion to a new religion that he feels has been divinely revealed to him. This faith rejects Egypt's traditional gods in favor of monolatristic worship of the sun, referred to as Aten. Akhnaton intends to promote Atenism throughout Egypt, which earns him the hatred of the country's corrupt and politically active traditional priesthood. Life in court does not prove to be good for Sinuhe; it drags him away from his previous ambition of helping the poor while falling obsessively in love with a Babylonian courtesan named Nefer (Bella Darvi). He squanders all of his and his parents' property in order to buy her gifts, only to have her reject him nonetheless. Returning dejectedly home, Sinuhe learns that his parents have committed suicide over his shameful behavior. He has their bodies embalmed so that they can pass on to the afterlife, and, having no way to pay for the service, works off his debts in the embalming house. Lacking a tomb in which to put his parents' mummies, Sinuhe buries them in the sand amid the lavish funerary complexes of the Valley of the Kings. Merit finds him there and warns him that Akhnaton has condemned him to death; one of the pharaoh's daughters fell ill and died while Sinuhe was working as an embalmer, and the tragedy is being blamed on his desertion of the court. Merit urges Sinuhe to flee Egypt and rebuild his career elsewhere, and the two of them share one night of passion before he takes ship out of the country. Olympic discus thrower Fortune Gordien and Jean Simmons on set. For the next ten years Sinuhe and Kaptah wander the known world, where Sinuhe's superior Egyptian medical training gives him an excellent reputation as healer. Sinuhe finally saves enough money from his fees to return home; he buys his way back into the favor of the court with a precious piece of military intelligence he learned abroad, informing Horemheb (now commander of the Egyptian army) that the barbarian Hittites plan to attack the country with superior iron weapons. Akhnaton is in any case ready to forgive Sinuhe, according to his religion's doctrine of mercy and pacifism. These qualities have made Aten-worship extremely popular amid the common people, including Merit, with whom Sinuhe is reunited. He finds that she bore him a son named Thoth (Tommy Rettig), a result of their night together many years ago, who shares his father's interest in medicine. Meanwhile, the priests of the old gods have been fomenting hate crimes against the Aten's devotees, and now urge Sinuhe to help them kill Akhnaton and put Horemheb on the throne instead. The physician is privately given extra inducement by the princess Baketamun (Gene Tierney); she reveals that he is actually the son of the previous pharaoh by a concubine, discarded at birth because of the jealousy of the old queen and raised by foster parents. The princess now suggests that Sinuhe could poison both Akhnaton and Horemheb and rule Egypt himself (with her at his side). Sinuhe is still reluctant to perform this evil deed until the Egyptian army mounts a full attack on worshipers of the Aten. Kaptah manages to smuggle Thoth out the country, but Merit is killed while seeking refuge at the new god's altar. In his grief Sinuhe blames Akhnaton for the whole mess and administers poison to him at their next meeting. The pharaoh realizes what has been done, but accepts his fate. He still believes his faith is true, but that he has understood it imperfectly; future generations will be able to spread the same faith better than he. Enlightened by Akhnaton's dying words, Sinuhe warns Horemheb that his wine is also poisoned, thus allowing him to marry the Princess and become Pharaoh. Later, Sinuhe is brought before his old friend for preaching the same ideals Akhnaton believed in, and is sentenced to be exiled to the shores of the Red Sea, where he spends his remaining days writing down his life story, in the hope that it may be found by Thoth or his descendants. Ultimately it is revealed that \\"These things happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ\\". Cast * Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe * Victor Mature as Horemheb * Jean Simmons as Merit * Bella Darvi as Nefer * Gene Tierney as Baketamon * Michael Wilding as Akhenaten * Peter Ustinov as Kaptah * Judith Evelyn as Taia * Henry Daniell as Mekere * John Carradine as Grave robber * Carl Benton Reid as Senmut * Tommy Rettig as Thoth * Anitra Stevens as Queen Nefertiti * Michael Ansara as Hittite Commander * Peter Reynolds as Sinuhe, age 10 Original novel The script was based on the Waltari novel of the same name. It is elaborated in the book, but not the film, that Sinuhe was named by his mother from the Story of Sinuhe, which does include references to Aten but was written many centuries before the 18th dynasty. The use of the \\"Cross of Life\\" ankh to represent Akhnaton's \\"new\\" religion reflects a popular and esoteric belief in the 1950s that monolatristic Atenism was a sort of proto- Christianity. While the ankh has no known connection to the modern cross, the principal symbol of Aten was not an ankh but a solar disk emitting rays, though the rays usually ended with a hand holding out an ankh to the worshipers. The sun-disk is seen only twice; when we first meet Akhnaton in the desert, he has painted it on a rock, and Sinuhe says \\"Look! He worships the face of the sun.\\" It appears again as part of the wall painting above Akhnaton's throne. With that said, the ankh was used in the original novel. Likewise, Akhnaton's dying revelation that God is much more than the face of the sun is actually found among Waltari's best-known writings. The best selling novel was also well received critically, with the New York Times describing it as \\"fine and panoramic\\". Development Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox bought the film rights in 1952. He announced the film would be his only personal production in 1953. Marlon Brando was going to play the lead and Casey Robinson would write the script. Robinson finished his script by March 1953. In April, Fox announced the film would be shot in its new wide screen technology, CinemaScope. Zanuck borrowed Michael Curtiz from Paramount to direct. In November 1953 Victor Mature joined the cast along with Jean Peters and Kirk Douglas. In January 1954, Fox said the cast would also include Betta St. John, Peter Ustinov, and Bella Darvi. It was the film debut of Darvi, who was a protege of Zanuck and his wife Virginia (\\"Darvi\\" was a combination of \\"Darryl\\" and \\"Virginia\\"). She eventually became Darryl Zanuck's mistress. By January, Peters was out and replaced by Jean Simmons, so only the right half of publicity materials had to be changed. In October 1953, Philip Dunne signed a new three-year contract with Fox and joined the film. Dunne said Robinson had done \\"a pretty good script\\" which was ultimately done in by \\"casting\\". Dunne says he worked on the film as an \\"unofficial producer\\".McGilligan p 164 There were a number of Egyptian-themed films made around this time, including Valley of the Kings and Land of the Pharaohs. Marlon Brando quits In February 1954, a week before filming was to start, Brando took part in a reading of the script. Dunne says Brando read the part \\"absolutely beautifully\\" but then Curtiz said \\"How can I with all my genius make you play this man who is one minute hero the next moment villain?\\" Dunne says he went home to write a memo for Curtiz then got a call saying Brando had quit the film.=McGilligan p 164-65 Brando said he was unable to play his part due to mental strain and had his psychiatrist support him. As location filming in Egypt had already started, Fox sued Brando for $2 million. Filming was postponed. Fox tried to borrow Dirk Bogarde from J. Arthur Rank in Britain. Hedda Hopper suggested John Cassavetes. Cameron Mitchell, then a Fox contract star tested for the role of the Pharaoh. Farley Granger was the next choice and considered the role, but then decided he was not interested after having just moved to New York. Other contenders for the role had been John Derek and Cameron Mitchell, who were all screen tested. Eventually the role went to Edmund Purdom borrowed from MGM. MGM took $300,000 for Purdom's services although he was only paid $500 a week. Cassavetes later credited Hopper's public push for him as helping kick start his career in Hollywood. Philip Dunne later said he tried to get Zanuck to cast Cassavetes as the Pharaoh but Zanuck wanted an English actor to play it. \\"He thought all kings, emperors and nobility should be played by English actors\\", said Dunne.McGilligan p 164 Michael Wilding played the part. Dunne says he also wanted Dana Wynter to play Nefertiti ‚Äì he thought the actress just looked like the real queen ‚Äì but instead \\"Zanuck let Michael Curtiz cast some lumpish girlfriend who looked about as much like Nefertiti as you or I do.\\"Lee Server, Screenwriter: Words Become Pictures, 1987 p 107 Fox's lawsuit against Brando was resolved when the actor agreed to make D√©sir√©e (1954) for the studio. Production Filming began in May 1954. Some of the sets, costumes, and props from this film were bought and re-used by Cecil B. DeMille for The Ten Commandments (1956). As the events in that story take place seventy years after those in The Egyptian, this re-use creates an unintended sense of continuity. The commentary track on the Ten Commandments DVD points out many of these re-uses. Only three actors, Mimi Gibson, Michael Ansara and John Carradine, and a handful of extras, appeared in both pictures. The Prince Aly Khan was a consultant during filming; he was engaged to Gene Tierney. Dunne recalls during filming \\"Darryl was so besotten [with Darvi] he decided to go around to our film stills department and see how she looked in her costumes. He'd been running the lot for 25 years, but didn't know where it was and flew into a rage. It was right next door to his private dining room.\\" Music The Egyptian soundtrack cover. Owing to the short time available in post- production, the composing duties on the film score were divided between two of 20th Century-Fox's best-known composers: Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. Newman would later conduct the score in a re-recording for release on Decca Records. Musician John Morgan undertook a \\"restoration and reconstruction\\" of the score for a recording conducted by William T. Stromberg in 1998, on Marco Polo Records. The performance of the score recorded for the film was released by Film Score Monthly in 2001. Home video The film has been released on DVD and there are several Blu-rays, including bootlegs from Brazil and Spain. Legitimate HD releases have appeared in America (Twilight Time), France (Sidonis Calysta), Denmark (Soul Media) and Japan (Mermaid Films). The region 0 US disc's 2010 transfer has a drastically revised color scheme, which afflicted numerous Fox restorations carried out at the same time.

Origins Born about 1290, his father was Sir Richard Willoughby II, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas until his death in 1325. Career After legal training and before he came into his inheritance, he represented Nottinghamshire in the Parliament of February 1324. Later that year he was appointed a serjeant-at-law, becoming in 1328 a Justice of the Common Pleas and in 1330 was promoted to the Court of the King's Bench. In 1332, while serving on a judicial commission in the East Midlands, he was kidnapped by the infamous Folville gang and their Coterel allies, who wanted 1300 marks for his release. Willoughby was notoriously corrupt‚Äîthe royal yearbooks would later report Willoughby as selling the laws of the land \\"as if they were cattle or oxen\\"‚Äîand according to the near- contemporary Knighton's Chronicon, the Coterel associates had much to feel aggrieved about. He was able to raise the money and was compensated by the government with an annual payment of 100 marks. On three occasions he served briefly as Lord Chief Justice during the absence of Geoffrey Scrope. Controversy again surrounded him when on judicial business in 1340 he was besieged for two days at Thurcaston in Leicestershire by another criminal gang. Later that year, as part of King Edward III's purge of the administration, he was demoted to puisne rank, transferred back to the lower court of common pleas and then imprisoned in Corfe Castle in Dorset on charges of corruption. On trial the next year he eventually pleaded guilty and paid a 1200 mark fine, followed by a humiliating circuit round the county courts to answer any local accusations. Whatever faults caused his downfall, he seemed to be forgiven by 1343 when he was reappointed to the common pleas bench, where he served until his retirement in 1357. In parallel with his judicial career, he actively added to the not inadequate lands his father had left him, primarily in his native Nottinghamshire. In addition, he benefited from lands brought to him in his three marriages, particularly the last. By his death he had increased his annual income in rents, coming out of nineteen counties, from about 140 pounds in 1325 to over 500 pounds, a massive amount at the time. He died on 14 March 1362 and was buried in the church of Willoughby on the Wolds in Nottinghamshire, where his monument can still be seen. Family In 1310, when he was about 20, he married his first wife Isabel (died 1332), daughter of Sir Roger Mortein, of Dunsby in Lincolnshire, and his wife Isabel, daughter of William Touchet. After her death, in 1333 he married Joan (died 1342), widow of Sir Bertram Monboucher (died 1332) and daughter and sole heiress of Sir Guiscard Charron, of Beamish in County Durham (died 1314). His third wife was Elizabeth (died after 1363), widow of Sir Richard Champernowne (died 1338), of Modbury in Devon. His daughter and heiress was Lucy, who married first Sir Thomas Huscarle (died 1352), of Purley Magna in Berkshire, and secondly Nicholas Carew, of Beddington in Surrey. ReferencesFurther reading *M.

He regards John Banville as \\"the world's greatest living writer\\". In August 2020, it was noticed that Boyne's latest novel, A Traveller at the Gates of Wisdom, which takes place in the real world in the year 1 AD, contained a section in which a seamstress refers to the ingredients used to create dyes. However, the listed ingredients were entirely fictional, being taken from the 2017 videogame The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and included items such as the \\"silent princess\\" flower, \\"octorok eyeballs\\", and \\"the tail of the red lizalfos\\". The error was initially posted on Reddit, and after writer Dana Schwartz highlighted the segment on Twitter, theorizing that Boyne had done an Internet search for 'how to dye clothes red' and used the Zelda results without looking into the context, Boyne admitted his error, saying \\"I‚Äôll leave it as it is.

Early life Cameron was born in 1945 in Scotland, read law at Edinburgh University, and studied theology at Edinburgh and Cambridge before being ordained as a minister in the Church of Scotland. Career Cameron and his family moved to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia at the beginning of 1991, when he was appointed Principal of St Andrew's College at the University of Sydney, and thus became a minister in the Presbyterian Church of Australia. Conviction for heresy Cameron was charged with heresy in 1993 for challenging Christian beliefs, as Samuel Angus, a previous professor at St Andrew's College, had been in the 1930s. Whereas Angus was finally acquitted, Cameron was convicted by the Presbyterian Church of Australia of heresy for disagreeing with the first chapter of the Westminster Confession of Faith, which as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, he was required \\"firmly and constantly to adhere thereto and to the utmost of [his] power to maintain and defend\\", by questioning the writings of Paul in the New Testament. The charge related to a sermon that he preached on 2 March 1992 called \\"The Place of Women in the Church\\" to 300 members of a Dorcas Society Rally (a Presbyterian women's organisation) in the conservative Ashfield Presbyterian Church. In the sermon Cameron supported the ordination of women to the ministry, criticised the church's hard line on homosexuality, and attacked fundamentalist Christianity in general. According to Bruce Christian, a member of the Sydney Presbytery in the Presbyterian Church, Cameron was prosecuted for his attitude to Scripture in the lecture, stating: \\"The point he actually made at the public rally was that there was little value in arguing the hermeneutics of 1 Timothy 2:11-15 on the ordination of women, the simple fact is that Paul got it wrong.\\" In Australia, most congregations of the Presbyterian Church had left that body in 1977 to join the Uniting Church in Australia. The thirty-six percent of congregations that stayed tended to be more conservative than the majority that left. This meant that the Presbyterian Church in Australia was a far more conservative body than its 'parent' the Church of Scotland. Thus, Cameron's opinions were far more remarkable in the context of the Australian church than they would have been in the Scottish context. A church spokesman, Paul Cooper noted that: > \\"though the views that Dr Cameron is spouting would be acceptable in > Scotland, they are not acceptable in Australia. We are a different > church...an independent Church. Colonialism is dead. Dr Cameron wants the > Presbyterian Church to be like the Church of Scotland...but we make our own > decisions and our decision is that we don‚Äôt want to be that sort of church. > We stand under the authority of the Bible.\\" The ordination of women was a particularly 'live' issue at the time. Seven months after Dr Cameron's arrival, the General Assembly of Australia had decided to reverse a seventeen-year-old policy of ordaining women. Cameron's thoughts towards women in the Church has been also attributed to him having a daughter, with him stating in his controversial sermon: > \\"it was only recently that the full significance came home to me when I > suddenly realised that the effect of the decision to ban the ordination of > women is that my daughter cannot become a minister of the Presbyterian > Church of Australia. I don't mean that she was intending to. I mean that up > to that point it was only the absurdity of the position that had struck > me...after that I began to get angry. My daughter...goes to the PLC Croydon. > It occurs to me that these initials now stand for Presbyterian Ladies > Can't.\\" Cameron's conviction might have led to deposition (exclusion from the ministry) or excommunication (expulsion from the church). However he withdrew his last appeal and resigned from the ministry on 31 July 1994. Cameron returned to Scotland in January 1996, and left the Church of Scotland to be ordained in the Scottish Episcopal Church (an historic Church that is in communion with the Church of England within the Anglican Communion). Published works Cameron is the author several books, the most well-known of which, Heretic, , gives his account of the heresy trial.

This is accomplished using an indirect offset (gravure) printing process that involves an image being transferred from the clich√© via a silicone pad onto a substrate. Pad printing is used for printing on otherwise difficult to print on products in many industries including medical, automotive, promotional, apparel, and electronic objects, as well as appliances, sports equipment and toys. It can also be used to deposit functional materials such as conductive inks, adhesives, dyes and lubricants. Physical changes within the ink film both on the clich√© and on the pad allow it to leave the etched image area in favor of adhering to the pad, and to subsequently release from the pad in favor of adhering to the substrate. The unique properties of the silicone pad enable it to pick the image up from a flat plane and transfer it to a variety of surfaces, such as flat, cylindrical, spherical, compound angles, textures, concave, or convex surfaces. History While crude forms of pad printing have existed for centuries, it was not until the twentieth century that the technology became suitable for widespread use. First gaining a foothold in the watch-making industry following World War II, developments in the late 60s and early 70s, such as silicone pads and more advanced equipment, made the printing method far more practical. The ability to print on formerly unprintable surfaces caught the imaginations of engineers and designers, and as a result pad printing exploded into the mass production marketplace. Today, pad printing is a well established technology covering a wide spectrum of industries and applications.  Process =Cycle Cycles of pad printing on the plates # From the home position, the sealed ink cup (an inverted cup containing ink) sits over the etched artwork area of the printing plate, covering the image and filling it with ink. # The sealed ink cup moves away from the etched artwork area, taking all excess ink and exposing the etched image, which is filled with ink. The top layer of ink becomes tacky as soon as it is exposed to the air; that is how the ink adheres to the transfer pad and later to the substrate. # The transfer pad presses down onto the printing plate momentarily. As the pad is compressed, it pushes air outward and causes the ink to lift (transfer) from the etched artwork area onto the pad. # As the transfer pad lifts away, the tacky ink film inside the etched artwork area is picked up on the pad. A small amount of ink remains in the printing plate. # As the transfer pad moves forward, the ink cup also moves to cover the etched artwork area on the printing plate. The ink cup again fills the etched artwork image on the plate with ink in preparation for the next cycle. # The transfer pad compresses down onto the substrate, transferring the ink layer picked up from the printing plate to the substrate surface. Then, it lifts off the substrate and returns to the home position, thus completing one print cycle. Plate and ink interface technologiesOpen inkwell system= Open ink well systems, the older method of pad printing, used an ink trough for the ink supply, which was located behind the printing plate. A flood bar pushed a pool of ink over the plate, and a doctor blade removes the ink from the plate surface, leaving ink on the etched artwork area ready for the pad to pick up. =Sealed ink cup system= Sealed ink cup systems employ a sealed container which acts as the ink supply, flood bar and doctor blade all at the same time. A ceramic ring with a highly polished working edge provides the seal against the printing plate. Printing pad Pads are three-dimensional objects typically molded of silicone rubber. They function as a transfer vehicle, picking up ink from the printing plate, and transferring it to the part (substrate). They vary in shape and diameter depending on the application. There are two main shape groups: \\"round pads\\" and long narrow pads called \\"bar pads\\". Pads are also made in other shapes, called \\"loaf pads\\". Within each group there are three size categories: small, medium, and large size pads. It is also possible to engineer custom-shaped pads to meet special application requirements. Image plate Image plates (also called clich√©s or print plates) are used to contain the desired artwork \\"image\\" etched in its surface. Their function is to hold ink in this etched cavity, allowing the pad to pick up this ink as a film in the shape of the artwork, which is then transferred to the substrate. There are two main types of printing plate materials: photopolymer and steel. Photopolymer plates are the most popular, as they are easy to use. These are typically used in short to medium production runs. Steel plates come in two forms: thin steel for medium to long runs, and thick steel for very long runs. Both steel plate types are generally processed by the plate supplier as it involves the use of specialized equipment. Multicolor applications can be executed by the coordinated use of several clich√©s. One image can contain several contrast colors (monochrome) by applying different engraving depths and/or grid resolutions. Printing ink Ink is used to mark or decorate parts. It comes in different chemical families to match the type of material to be printed (please consult the substrate compatibility chart for selection). Pad printing inks are often \\"solvent-based\\" and require mixing with additives before use. They typically seem dry to the touch within seconds although complete drying (cure) might take a substantially longer period of time. There are FDA approved edible variants that have been developed for human consumption and more ecological variants to reduce the environmental impact. There are many more options. Inks that cure via the use of Ultra Violet light are convenient for certain applications. UV inks will not fully cure until UV light hits the ink. UV curable ink can be wiped off many substrates when mistakes are made. They can be cured with UV light in as fast as 1 second of light exposure. This depends on the ink, substrate and the light power and spectrum. UV inks can be reused as the pot life can be high as long as the ink stays clean, blocked from UV light and hasn't broken down from sitting. This same feature makes it easier to clean than some solvent and epoxy like two part component inks. Also there are heat curable inks, which work in much the same way as UV in the sense that there is a \\"trigger\\" that cures the ink when pulled. Two-component inks usually have a pot life of only a few hours or so. They must be disposed of when they cannot be revived (by means of retarders etc.) Climatic conditions will significantly affect the performance of any pad printing ink, especially the open ink well style printers. Too dry conditions can lead to faster evaporation of solvents causing the ink to thicken prematurely and too much moisture can lead to ink issues of \\"clumping\\" or something alike. Also the climate can affect other aspects of the printing process such as ink pick up and release from the plate to the pad to the substrate, as well as polymer plate to blade chattering or binding due to humidity.  Substrate  Substrate is the technical term used to address any parts or materials to be printed. Fixtures vary in materials and complexity depending on the application. Substrates need to be clean and free from surface contamination to allow proper ink adhesion. Making of printing plates There are two main techniques used to create a printing plate. The traditional technique requires a UV exposure unit and involves photo exposure with film positives and chemical etching. A second technique known as \\"computer to plate\\" requires a laser engraver and involves automated laser etching. The latter technique is more convenient for short production delays, high precision, stable quality control. Both techniques can be applied on a specialized polymer or steel plate. The standard cycle life that can be expected out of a polymer plate is quite low (50,000 impressions on the high end). By comparison, a hardened steel plate can easily last for over 1 million impressions. Printing application examples diecast models, such as this model Airbus A340, as the resultant printed decals are resistant to fading. Pad printing is typically used for applications where print quality, precision or a complex shape are involved. *Medical devices (syringes, surgical instruments, etc.) *Implantable & in body medical items (catheter tubes, contact lenses, etc.) *Pharmaceutics (pills) *Candy *Cosmetic packaging (eyeliner, perfume bottles, etc.) *Caps and closures (drink bottle caps, etc.) *Golf ball logos/graphics *Hockey pucks *Decorative designs/graphics appearing on toys (Hot Wheels or Matchbox toy cars, balls, etc.) *Automotive parts (turn signal indicators, panel controls, etc.) *Letters on computer keyboards and calculator keys *TV and computer monitors *Identification labels and serial numbers for many applications *Apparel industry for printing labels directly on clothing *Promotional gifts and give- aways *Shoe heels ReferencesExternal links Printing ","title":"Pad printing"},{"id":"6312059","text":"Tina Campbell (born 1971)Tina Campbell's profile on u.tv WebArchive.org; captured 18 November 2002, accessed 5 April 2009\\"New job, new baby\\" Belfast Telegraph, 8 February 2007, retrieved 10 January 2007 is a Northern Irish television presenter and journalist.

Unlike national citizenship, where individuals interact in such capacities with one sovereign state, transnational citizenship transcends pre-established territorial boundaries in order to create a modern meaning of \\"belonging\\" in an increasingly globalized society. Additionally, while preconceived notions of citizenship are often divided between national, social and individual forms of identity, all three categories serve to contribute to the meaning of transnational citizenship. State citizenship can be defined as an individual establishing their sense of belonging by espousing to the liberal-democratic values of the state in the public sphere. When applied to transnational citizenship, an individual would have the opportunity to be civically engaged in multiple societies. A Dominican politician who lives in Santo Domingo yet canvasses in a highly dense Dominican American population in Boston, Massachusetts for external votes is an example of a transnational citizens functioning politically between two states. In terms of the categories of social and individual forms of belonging, transnational citizens are marked by multiple identities and allegiances, and often travel between two or more countries, all in which they have created sizeable networks of differing functions. Similar to global or cosmopolitan citizenship, it is composed of cross-national and multi-layered memberships to certain societies. Transnational citizenship is based on the idea that a new global framework consistent of subgroups of national identities will eventually replace membership to one sole nation-state. In a hyper-realized version of transnational citizenship, \\"states become intermediaries between the local and the global.\\" Institutionalizing transnational citizenship would loosen ties between territories and citizenship and would ultimately result in a reconstruction of world order that forever changes the capacity in which individuals interact with government institutions. History and causes While some relate transnational citizenship to any historic shift or fusion of identities within nation-states, modern conceptions of the term have only surfaced in the past twenty years. Many attribute the evolution of the term to the rising situation of globalization. Globalization is defined by a heightened international access to the world capital market system and increased abilities to more rapid forms of communication. Due to the convenience and ease of modern international exchanges, globalization has become the process by which international economies as well as individuals interact with one another. Since post-Cold War 1989, the evolved \\"global political economy\\" has resulted in massive \\"reconfigurations of the world's arenas\\". Globalization transformed a confined geo-political system into one that relies heavily on multiple levels of local, national and global interactions. For example, China's industrialization from an agricultural society to a manufacturing society chronicled by excessive imports and exports contribute to a need to interconnect societies from all corners of the globe. The wealth that private institutions experienced from globalization resulted in \\"further extensions of corporations in search of faraway resources and markets\\". Beyond resulting in substantial political and economical shifts, globalization has also affected social and cultural practices between people. According to citizenship scholars like Andrew Vandenberg, such acts of globalization eventually \\"ended the constraints of space and time that conditioned all earlier human transactions, practices, and therefore identities. With the growth and distribution of technology, more people all over the world have come to establish personal relationships with one another. Former state-regulated formal encounters are now replaced by modern informal and all the more frequent interactions. Rapid world economic growth has consequently led to international migrations. In recent years, in conjunction with globalization, increased instances of uncontrolled and predominantly illegal international migrations contribute to opportunities for escalating transnational identities. Because obvious ties surface between immigrants, their home countries, and the receiving countries, the civic ramifications are widespread. Thus international immigration contributes to loosening individual state ties. Once in their host countries, immigrants form social networks while maintaining ties to their homeland. Some organizations function in both countries, which serves to further enhance the notion that international migrants act as transnational citizens in multiple lands. V. multiculturalism It is important to draw a distinction between transnational citizenship and multiculturalism among national citizens. While transnational citizens bring cultural and societal elements of their home countries to their host countries and vice versa, multiculturalism results from the fusion of differing ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples on a micro scale of a particular local environment. These interactions are described as \\"crosscutting and always mutually situational identifications.\\" Therefore, ethnic minorities and majorities alike intermingle in a mutually shared space. All different types of individuals function within the same system, and eventually collective national identities are formed. On the other hand, transnational citizens live within the context of two or more societies that differ in size, scope, populations, laws, morals, and cultural codes. While transnational citizens interact with those already present in each respective community, they are functioning within divergent spaces. They base their interactions more on the need to reconcile two completely diverse localities into a greater context that traverses international borders, politics, and ways of life. The European Union as a test case \\"The question for the future of citizenship is whether a 'global' citizenship can transcend citizenships defined by 'local' stages on the basis of blood and birth through an act of the state itself.\\" ‚Äî Henry Teune Some scholars consider the creation of the European Union as the pilot case for testing Teune's question about whether or not transnational citizenship can surpass national citizenship. Starting in the early 1980s, European national migration control officials met and established a consensus over the relationship between migration, asylum and crime. The control officials deemed migration as a security issue, and called for a \\"multi-level governance\\" in order to control migratory practices. Virginie Guiraudon generates the theory of \\"venue-shopping\\" in order to describe how cross-national policies prevailed. Venue-shopping is the process by which political members seek out specific governmental settings in order to establish their ideal policy outcomes. Political actors circumvented national levels of control in order to establish a \\"transnational cooperation\\" among nation-states. Starting in 1981, citizens with passports from European countries were able to move freely across borders into other European countries. Due to the increased ease of traversing borders, the \\"Europeanization\\" of individuals began to occur in which a new transnational identity could be conceived. The creation of the European Union only accelerated growing notions of transnational citizenship across the continent. The European Union came into being on November 1, 1993, when European nations signed the Treaty of Maastricht into law. The treaty established \\"community policy\\" in six new areas, one of which is termed \\"trans-European networks.\\" The treaty also discusses the specific effects of the merger on a new formation of European citizenship. The benefits of European citizenship include the ability for citizens to freely cross borders into and subsequently reside in other European countries, the right to vote in elections and run for office in both municipal and European elections in the state in which the citizen resides, the right to access any member country's diplomatic or consular services in a third-party country in which the citizen's birth nation is not represented, and the citizen's right to petition to the European parliament. The treaty thus instituted \\"European citizenship over and above national citizenship\\". This ultimately facilitates a new form of \\"European identity\\" that allows for members of the European Union to function as transnational actors beyond their countries' borders, establishing the entire continent as one cohesive entity. Finally, the creation of the euro serves as the pinnacle of Europe's newfound economic unification. On January 1, 1999, the euro replaced the pre-existing currency in 11 European countries. The Treaty of Maastricht also created the European System of Central Banks, which consists of the Central European Bank and national central banks working together to establish monetary policy across participating countries. Some scholars consider the act of unifying the currency as \\"culminating the progress toward economic and monetary union in Europe\\". While the aspect of monetary union is clear, the far-reaching effects of economic union between countries could be considered a cause for debate. Regardless, the euro allows for transnational citizens of the European Union to not only move freely across borders, but also to experience easier monetary exchanges through the ability to use a currency that is present in both the citizens' home and host countries. The political, economic, and social ramifications that result from the invention of the European Union help contribute to the construction of European citizens as the international model for transnational citizenship.

Meteor paths appear at random locations in the sky, but the apparent paths of two or more meteors from the same shower will converge at the radiant. The radiant is the vanishing point of the meteor paths, which are parallel lines in three-dimensional space, as seen from the perspective of the observer, who views a two-dimensional projection against the sky. The geometric effect is identical to crepuscular rays, where parallel sunbeams appear to converge. A meteor that does not point back to the known radiant for a given shower is known as a sporadic and is not considered part of that shower. Shower meteors may appear a short time before the radiant has risen in observer's eastern sky. The radiant in such cases is above the horizon at the meteor's altitude. During the active period of most showers, the radiant moves nearly one degree eastwards, parallel to the ecliptic, against the stellar background each day. This is called the radiant's diurnal drift, and is to a large degree due to the Earth's own orbital motion around the Sun, which also proceeds at nearly one degree a day. As the radiant is determined by the superposition of the motions of Earth and meteoroid, the changing orbital direction of the Earth towards the east causes the radiant to move to the east as well. Cause Geminid meteors, clearly showing the position of the radiant Meteor showers are mostly caused by the trails of dust and debris left in the wake of a comet. This dust continues to move along the comet's wake, and when the Earth moves through such debris, a meteor shower results. Because all of the debris is moving in roughly the same direction, the meteors which strike the atmosphere all \\"point\\" back to the direction of the comet's path. As an exception, the Geminids are a shower caused by the object 3200 Phaethon, which is thought to be a Palladian asteroid. Observation The radiant is an important factor in observation. If the radiant point is at or below the horizon, then few if any meteors will be observed. This is because the atmosphere shields the Earth from most of the debris, and only those meteors which happen to be travelling exactly (or very near) tangential to the Earth's surface will be viewable.

The H.323 standard addresses call signaling and control, multimedia transport and control, and bandwidth control for point-to-point and multi-point conferences. It is widely implementedH.323 Forum List of Products and Services by voice and videoconferencing equipment manufacturers, is used within various Internet real-time applications such as GnuGK and NetMeeting and is widely deployed worldwide by service providers and enterprises for both voice and video services over IP networks. It is a part of the ITU-T H.32x series of protocols, which also address multimedia communications over ISDN, the PSTN or SS7, and 3G mobile networks. H.323 call signaling is based on the ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 protocol and is suited for transmitting calls across networks using a mixture of IP, PSTN, ISDN, and QSIG over ISDN. A call model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP telephony into existing networks of ISDN-based PBX systems, including transitions to IP-based PBXs. Within the context of H.323, an IP-based PBX might be a gatekeeper or other call control element which provides service to telephones or videophones. Such a device may provide or facilitate both basic services and supplementary services, such as call transfer, park, pick-up, and hold.  History  The first version of H.323 was published by the ITU in November 1996ITU-T Recommendation H.323 (11/1996), first version of H.323. with an emphasis of enabling videoconferencing capabilities over a local area network (LAN), but was quickly adopted by the industry as a means of transmitting voice communication over a variety of IP networks, including WANs and the Internet (see VoIP). Over the years, H.323 has been revised and re-published with enhancements necessary to better enable both voice and video functionality over packet-switched networks, with each version being backward- compatible with the previous version.ITU-T Recommendation H.323, in force, superseded and withdrawn component. Recognizing that H.323 was being used for communication not only on LANs, but over WANs and within large carrier networks, the title of H.323 was changed when published in 1998.ITU-T Recommendation H.323 (02/1998), Packet-based multimedia communications systems. The title, which has since remained unchanged, is \\"Packet-Based Multimedia Communications Systems.\\" The current version of H.323 was approved in 2009.ITU-T Recommendation H.323 (12/2009), Packet-based multimedia communications systems. One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards not only defining the basic call model, but also the supplementary services needed to address business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to transport audio and video over IP networks.  Protocols  H.323 is a system specification that describes the use of several ITU-T and IETF protocols. The protocols that comprise the core of almost any H.323 system are:See ITU-T Recommendations of the H.323 System for a detailed list. *H.225.0 Registration, Admission and Status (RAS), which is used between an H.323 endpoint and a Gatekeeper to provide address resolution and admission control services. *H.225.0 Call Signaling, which is used between any two H.323 entities in order to establish communication. (Based on Q.931) *H.245 control protocol for multimedia communication, which describes the messages and procedures used for capability exchange, opening and closing logical channels for audio, video and data, control and indications. *Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), which is used for sending or receiving multimedia information (voice, video, or text) between any two entities. Many H.323 systems also implement other protocols that are defined in various ITU-T Recommendations to provide supplementary services support or deliver other functionality to the user. Some of those Recommendations are: * H.235 series describes security within H.323, including security for both signaling and media. * H.239 describes dual stream use in videoconferencing, usually one for live video, the other for still images. * H.450 series describes various supplementary services. * H.460 series defines optional extensions that might be implemented by an endpoint or a Gatekeeper, including ITU-T Recommendations H.460.17, H.460.18, and H.460.19 for Network address translation (NAT) / Firewall (FW) traversal. In addition to those ITU-T Recommendations, H.323 implements various IETF Request for Comments (RFCs) for media transport and media packetization, including the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  Codecs  H.323 utilizes both ITU-defined codecs and codecs defined outside the ITU. Codecs that are widely implemented by H.323 equipment include: * Audio codecs: G.711, G.729 (including G.729a), G.723.1, G.726, G.722, G.728, Speex, AAC-LD * Text codecs: T.140 * Video codecs: H.261, H.263, H.264, H.265 All H.323 terminals providing video communications shall be capable of encoding and decoding video according to H.261 QCIF. All H.323 terminals shall have an audio codec and shall be capable of encoding and decoding speech according to ITU-T Rec. G.711. All terminals shall be capable of transmitting and receiving A-law and Œº-law. Support for other audio and video codecs is optional.  Architecture  The H.323 system defines several network elements that work together in order to deliver rich multimedia communication capabilities. Those elements are Terminals, Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), Gateways, Gatekeepers, and Border Elements. Collectively, terminals, multipoint control units and gateways are often referred to as endpoints. H.323 uses TCP port number 1720. While not all elements are required, at least two terminals are required in order to enable communication between two people. In most H.323 deployments, a gatekeeper is employed in order to, among other things, facilitate address resolution.  H.323 network elements  Terminals = Figure 1 - A complete, sophisticated protocol stack Terminals in an H.323 network are the most fundamental elements in any H.323 system, as those are the devices that users would normally encounter. They might exist in the form of a simple IP phone or a powerful high-definition videoconferencing system. Inside an H.323 terminal is something referred to as a Protocol stack, which implements the functionality defined by the H.323 system. The protocol stack would include an implementation of the basic protocol defined in ITU-T Recommendation H.225.0 and H.245, as well as RTP or other protocols described above. The diagram, figure 1, depicts a complete, sophisticated stack that provides support for voice, video, and various forms of data communication. In reality, most H.323 systems do not implement such a wide array of capabilities, but the logical arrangement is useful in understanding the relationships. = Multipoint control units = A multipoint control unit (MCU) is responsible for managing multipoint conferences and is composed of two logical entities referred to as the Multipoint Controller (MC) and the Multipoint Processor (MP). In more practical terms, an MCU is a conference bridge not unlike the conference bridges used in the PSTN today. The most significant difference, however, is that H.323 MCUs might be capable of mixing or switching video, in addition to the normal audio mixing done by a traditional conference bridge. Some MCUs also provide multipoint data collaboration capabilities. What this means to the end user is that, by placing a video call into an H.323 MCU, the user might be able to see all of the other participants in the conference, not only hear their voices. = Gateways = Gateways are devices that enable communication between H.323 networks and other networks, such as PSTN or ISDN networks. If one party in a conversation is utilizing a terminal that is not an H.323 terminal, then the call must pass through a gateway in order to enable both parties to communicate. Gateways are widely used today in order to enable the legacy PSTN phones to interconnect with the large, international H.323 networks that are presently deployed by services providers. Gateways are also used within the enterprise in order to enable enterprise IP phones to communicate through the service provider to users on the PSTN. Gateways are also used in order to enable videoconferencing devices based on H.320 and H.324 to communicate with H.323 systems. Most of the third generation (3G) mobile networks deployed today utilize the H.324 protocol and are able to communicate with H.323-based terminals in corporate networks through such gateway devices. = Gatekeepers = A Gatekeeper is an optional component in the H.323 network that provides a number of services to terminals, gateways, and MCU devices. Those services include endpoint registration, address resolution, admission control, user authentication, and so forth. Of the various functions performed by the gatekeeper, address resolution is the most important as it enables two endpoints to contact each other without either endpoint having to know the IP address of the other endpoint. Gatekeepers may be designed to operate in one of two signaling modes, namely \\"direct routed\\" and \\"gatekeeper routed\\" mode. Direct routed mode is the most efficient and most widely deployed mode. In this mode, endpoints utilize the RAS protocol in order to learn the IP address of the remote endpoint and a call is established directly with the remote device. In the gatekeeper routed mode, call signaling always passes through the gatekeeper. While the latter requires the gatekeeper to have more processing power, it also gives the gatekeeper complete control over the call and the ability to provide supplementary services on behalf of the endpoints. H.323 endpoints use the RAS protocol to communicate with a gatekeeper. Likewise, gatekeepers use RAS to communicate with other gatekeepers. A collection of endpoints that are registered to a single Gatekeeper in H.323 is referred to as a ‚Äúzone‚Äù. This collection of devices does not necessarily have to have an associated physical topology. Rather, a zone may be entirely logical and is arbitrarily defined by the network administrator. Gatekeepers have the ability to neighbor together so that call resolution can happen between zones. Neighboring facilitates the use of dial plans such as the Global Dialing Scheme. Dial plans facilitate ‚Äúinter-zone‚Äù dialing so that two endpoints in separate zones can still communicate with each other. = Border elements and peer elements = Figure 2 - An illustration of an administrative domain with border elements, peer elements, and gatekeepers Border Elements and Peer Elements are optional entities similar to a Gatekeeper, but that do not manage endpoints directly and provide some services that are not described in the RAS protocol. The role of a border or peer element is understood via the definition of an \\"administrative domain\\". An administrative domain is the collection of all zones that are under the control of a single person or organization, such as a service provider. Within a service provider network there may be hundreds or thousands of gateway devices, telephones, video terminals, or other H.323 network elements. The service provider might arrange devices into \\"zones\\" that enable the service provider to best manage all of the devices under its control, such as logical arrangement by city. Taken together, all of the zones within the service provider network would appear to another service provider as an \\"administrative domain\\". The border element is a signaling entity that generally sits at the edge of the administrative domain and communicates with another administrative domain. This communication might include such things as access authorization information; call pricing information; or other important data necessary to enable communication between the two administrative domains. Peer elements are entities within the administrative domain that, more or less, help to propagate information learned from the border elements throughout the administrative domain. Such architecture is intended to enable large-scale deployments within carrier networks and to enable services such as clearinghouses. The diagram, figure 2, provides an illustration of an administrative domain with border elements, peer elements, and gatekeepers.  H.323 network signaling  H.323 is defined as a binary protocol, which allows for efficient message processing in network elements. The syntax of the protocol is defined in ASN.1 and uses the Packed Encoding Rules (PER) form of message encoding for efficient message encoding on the wire. Below is an overview of the various communication flows in H.323 systems. = H.225.0 call signaling = Figure 3 - Establishment of an H.323 call Once the address of the remote endpoint is resolved, the endpoint will use H.225.0 Call Signaling in order to establish communication with the remote entity. H.225.0 messages are: * Setup and Setup acknowledge * Call Proceeding * Connect * Alerting * Information * Release Complete * Facility * Progress * Status and Status Inquiry * Notify In the simplest form, an H.323 call may be established as follows (figure 3). In this example, the endpoint (EP) on the left initiated communication with the gateway on the right and the gateway connected the call with the called party. In reality, call flows are often more complex than the one shown, but most calls that utilize the Fast Connect procedures defined within H.323 can be established with as few as 2 or 3 messages. Endpoints must notify their gatekeeper (if gatekeepers are used) that they are in a call. Once a call has concluded, a device will send a Release Complete message. Endpoints are then required to notify their gatekeeper (if gatekeepers are used) that the call has ended. = RAS signaling = Figure 4 - A high-level communication exchange between two endpoints (EP) and two gatekeepers (GK) Endpoints use the RAS protocol in order to communicate with a gatekeeper. Likewise, gatekeepers use RAS to communicate with peer gatekeepers. RAS is a fairly simple protocol composed of just a few messages. Namely: * Gatekeeper request, reject and confirm messages (GRx) * Registration request, reject and confirm messages (RRx) * Unregister request, reject and confirm messages (URx) * Admission request, reject and confirm messages (ARx) * Bandwidth request, reject and confirm message (BRx) * Disengage request, reject and confirm (DRx) * Location request, reject and confirm messages (LRx) * Info request, ack, nack and response (IRx) * Nonstandard message * Unknown message response * Request in progress (RIP) * Resource availability indication and confirm (RAx) * Service control indication and response (SCx) When an endpoint is powered on, it will generally send a gatekeeper request (GRQ) message to \\"discover\\" gatekeepers that are willing to provide service. Gatekeepers will then respond with a gatekeeper confirm (GCF) and the endpoint will then select a gatekeeper to work with. Alternatively, it is possible that a gatekeeper has been predefined in the system‚Äôs administrative setup so there is no need for the endpoint to discover one. Once the endpoint determines the gatekeeper to work with, it will try to register with the gatekeeper by sending a registration request (RRQ), to which the gatekeeper responds with a registration confirm (RCF). At this point, the endpoint is known to the network and can make and place calls. When an endpoint wishes to place a call, it will send an admission request (ARQ) to the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper will then resolve the address (either locally, by consulting another gatekeeper, or by querying some other network service) and return the address of the remote endpoint in the admission confirm message (ACF). The endpoint can then place the call. Upon receiving a call, a remote endpoint will also send an ARQ and receive an ACF in order to get permission to accept the incoming call. This is necessary, for example, to authenticate the calling device or to ensure that there is available bandwidth for the call. Figure 4 depicts a high-level communication exchange between two endpoints (EP) and two gatekeepers (GK). = H.245 call control = Once a call has initiated (but not necessarily fully connected) endpoints may initiate H.245 call control signaling in order to provide more extensive control over the conference. H.245 is a rather voluminous specification with many procedures that fully enable multipoint communication, though in practice most implementations only implement the minimum necessary in order to enable point-to-point voice and video communication. H.245 provides capabilities such as capability negotiation, master/slave determination, opening and closing of \\"logical channels\\" (i.e., audio and video flows), flow control, and conference control. It has support for both unicast and multicast communication, allowing the size of a conference to theoretically grow without bound.  Capability negotiation  Of the functionality provided by H.245, capability negotiation is arguably the most important, as it enables devices to communicate without having prior knowledge of the capabilities of the remote entity. H.245 enables rich multimedia capabilities, including audio, video, text, and data communication. For transmission of audio, video, or text, H.323 devices utilize both ITU-defined codecs and codecs defined outside the ITU. Codecs that are widely implemented by H.323 equipment include: * Video codecs: H.261, H.263, H.264 * Audio codecs: G.711, G.729, G.729a, G.723.1, G.726 * Text codecs: T.140 H.245 also enables real-time data conferencing capability through protocols like T.120. T.120-based applications generally operate in parallel with the H.323 system, but are integrated to provide the user with a seamless multimedia experience. T.120 provides such capabilities as application sharing T.128, electronic whiteboard T.126, file transfer T.127, and text chat T.134 within the context of the conference. When an H.323 device initiates communication with a remote H.323 device and when H.245 communication is established between the two entities, the Terminal Capability Set (TCS) message is the first message transmitted to the other side.  Master/slave determination  After sending a TCS message, H.323 entities (through H.245 exchanges) will attempt to determine which device is the \\"master\\" and which is the \\"slave.\\" This process, referred to as Master/Slave Determination (MSD), is important, as the master in a call settles all \\"disputes\\" between the two devices. For example, if both endpoints attempt to open incompatible media flows, it is the master who takes the action to reject the incompatible flow.  Logical channel signaling  Once capabilities are exchanged and master/slave determination steps have completed, devices may then open \\"logical channels\\" or media flows. This is done by simply sending an Open Logical Channel (OLC) message and receiving an acknowledgement message. Upon receipt of the acknowledgement message, an endpoint may then transmit audio or video to the remote endpoint.  Fast connect  Figure 5 - A typical H.245 exchange A typical H.245 exchange looks similar to figure 5: After this exchange of messages, the two endpoints (EP) in this figure would be transmitting audio in each direction. The number of message exchanges is numerous, each has an important purpose, but nonetheless takes time. For this reason, H.323 version 2 (published in 1998) introduced a concept called Fast Connect, which enables a device to establish bi-directional media flows as part of the H.225.0 call establishment procedures. With Fast Connect, it is possible to establish a call with bi-directional media flowing with no more than two messages, like in figure 3. Fast Connect is widely supported in the industry. Even so, most devices still implement the complete H.245 exchange as shown above and perform that message exchange in parallel to other activities, so there is no noticeable delay to the calling or called party.  Use cases = H.323 and voice over IP services  Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) describes the transmission of voice using the Internet or other packet switched networks. ITU-T Recommendation H.323 is one of the standards used in VoIP. VoIP requires a connection to the Internet or another packet switched network, a subscription to a VoIP service provider and a client (an analogue telephone adapter (ATA), VoIP Phone or \\"soft phone\\"). The service provider offers the connection to other VoIP services or to the PSTN. Most service providers charge a monthly fee, then additional costs when calls are made. Using VoIP between two enterprise locations would not necessarily require a VoIP service provider, for example. H.323 has been widely deployed by companies who wish to interconnect remote locations over IP using a number of various wired and wireless technologies.  H.323 and videoconference services  A videoconference, or videoteleconference (VTC), is a set of telecommunication technologies allowing two or more locations to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously. There are basically two types of videoconferencing; dedicated VTC systems have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment while desktop VTC systems are add- ons to normal PC's, transforming them into VTC devices. Simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible by means of a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. Due to the price point and proliferation of the Internet, and broadband in particular, there has been a strong spurt of growth and use of H.323-based IP videoconferencing. H.323 is accessible to anyone with a high speed Internet connection, such as DSL. Videoconferencing is utilized in various situations, for example; distance education, telemedicine, Video Relay Service, and business.  Alternatives  * IAX2 - Inter-Asterisk eXchange, a binary protocol, designed to reduce overhead especially in regard to voice streams. Defined in RFC 5456. * The IETF produced a standard called the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that also enables voice and video communication over IP. * There are also other ITU-T recommendations used for videoconferencing and videophone services ‚Äì H.320 (using ISDN) and H.324 (using regular analog phone lines and 3G mobile phones). * Jingle (Jabber/XMPP extension) also enables video and voice over IP. * Some providers (such as Skype) also use their own closed, proprietary formats. * Access Grid provides broadly similar functionality, with more emphasis on open-source and utilizing multicast. * EVO also provides relatively open functionality via Java, and includes H.323 support.

It is a highly stable boat, suitable for beginners, and is normally sailed by two people, although three can be accommodated comfortably.  Design  The variants in the design of the coypu depend on the builder. The hull is normally glass-reinforced plastic construction, with buoyancy tanks on front, sides, and rear. The centreboard is metal, and the rudder is removable, either fixed (i.e. does not have a downhaul) or with a moveable blade. Most Coypu mainsails are normally raised by feeding the luff into the track on the mast, although some variants have gunter rig sails. The mainsheet is fixed to the stern of the boat. A jib is used for normal use and only one size is available. The boat is heavy in comparison with other dinghies, so traditionally they have proved popular at training centres where removing the boat from the water on a regular basis is not necessary.

It is the administrative center of Bohorodchany Raion. Population: . History It is not known when the town was established, but it was first mentioned in 1441 as a property of certain Jan of Buczacz, the starost of Trembowla (today Terebovlia). Since the second half of the 15th century the local estate belonged to the Potocki family. In 1691 Konstancja Potocka n√©e Truskolaska, widow of the owner of the village Dominik Potocki, established a Roman Catholic church and a parish there. In 1742 the wooden church was replaced with a more permanent construction, founded by Stanis≈Çaw Kossakowski and devoted to the cult of Holy Mary. In 1765 the new church was donated to the Dominican Order, whose friars established a convent there. Later in the 18th century the town's area acted as a base for a local band of outlaws led by Oleksa Dovbush, a semi-legendary Hutsul folk hero, who according to a local legend took the town by force in 1744. In 1786 the town had 314 permanent buildings and 1,134 inhabitants. Following the Partitions of Poland the town became part of the Habsburg Empire and then Austria-Hungary. In the 19th century the town was a scene of intense social and economic activities by all three major groups of inhabitants ‚Äì Jews, Ukrainians and Poles. Already in 1770 a Polish language grammar school was established, followed by a Jewish Hertz Homberg school in 1785 and a state- sponsored German language grammar school in 1789. In 1848 a local branch of a Russka Rada (Ruthenian Council) was established by 29 local Ukrainians. Around the same time numerous Jewish social and educational facilities were established, including a Hebrew School of the Union of Hebrew Teachers of Austria (1908‚Äì1914), a local branch of Ezrat Israel zionist union (1896), a Torat Haim yeshiva (1908) and a grammar school for girls (1909).Jewish history in Bohorodchany By the end of the 19th century the town grew to 4,597 inhabitants, including 2,009 Jews, 1,788 Greek Catholics and 800 Roman Catholics. The largest estates in the surrounding area belonged to Count Rudolf Stadion. In the aftermath of World War I the town briefly belonged to ZUNR, but in 1919 was taken over by reborn Poland. The local life continued to flourish until World War II. The town was made a seat of a commune. In 1929 a Gmilut Hasadim welfare association was founded in the town. Following the joint Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, the Germans occupied the town and murdered the local Jews. They were brought to a shooting site in groups of 10‚Äì20 people and executed.http://yahadmap.org/#village/bogorodchany-ivano- frankivsk-ukraine.634 After the war, the town was seized by the Soviet Union and soon afterwards attached to Ukrainian SSR.

It dates to the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the central cultural treasures of Miryang. The current structure was built in 1884 according to the design of then-magistrate Yi In-jae. During the Joseon period, this was known as one of the three great pavilions of Korea, together with the Chokseongnu in Jinju and the Puby≈èk pavilion in Pyongyang. The Yeongnamnu itself is actually one of a complex of historic buildings. Stone-carved calligraphy from the Joseon period abounds in the pavilion complex. Also near the Yeongnamnu stand the Aranggak pavilion and the Miryang City Museum. The first pavilion was probably constructed on this site in the Silla period, as part of the now-vanished temple of Yeongnamsa. That pavilion was torn down in the late Goryeo period and replaced by the precursor of the current structure. It became affiliated with the Miryang guesthouse, which thanks to Miryang's location on the Great Yeongnam Road often played host to officials traveling between Hanyang (Seoul) and Busan.

The standard view is that Troy is located near the Dardanelles in Turkey. Wilkens claims that Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, though products of ancient Greek culture, are originally orally transmitted epic poems from Western Europe. Wilkens disagrees with conventional ideas about the historicity of the Iliad and the location and participants of the Trojan War. His work has had little impact among professional scholars. Anthony Snodgrass, Emeritus Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge University, has named Wilkens as an example of an \\"infinitely less-serious\\" writer.Snodgrass, Anthony. \\"A Paradigm Shift in Classical Archaeology?\\" Cambridge Archaeological Journal 12 (2002), p. 190. The title of his book comes from the Roman poet Ovid: \\"Now there are fields where Troy once stood...\\" (Latin: Iam seges est, ubi Troia fuit‚Ä¶, Ovid, Heroides 1.1.53) Wilkens' arguments Wilkens argues that Troy was located in England on the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridgeshire. He believes that Celts living there were attacked around 1200 BC by fellow Celts from the continent to battle over access to the tin mines in Cornwall as tin was a very important component for the production of bronze. According to Wilkens, St Michael's Mount is the site of Scylla and Charybdis Wilkens further hypothesises that the Sea Peoples found in the Late Bronze Age Mediterranean were Celts, who settled in Greece and the Aegean Islands as the Achaeans and Pelasgians. They named new cities after the places they had come from and brought the oral poems that formed the basis of the Iliad and the Odyssey with them from western Europe. Wilkens writes that, after being orally transmitted for about four centuries, the poems were translated and written down in Greek around 750 BC. The Greeks, who had forgotten about the origins of the poems, located the stories in the Mediterranean, where many Homeric place names could be found, but the poems' descriptions of towns, islands, sailing directions and distances were not altered to fit the reality of the Greek setting. He also writes that \\"It also appears that Homer's Greek contains a large number of loan words from western European languages, more often from Dutch rather than English, French or German.\\"Trojan Kings of England These languages are considered by linguists to have not existed until at least 1000 years after Homer. Wilkens argues that the Atlantic Ocean was the theatre for the Odyssey instead of the Mediterranean. For example: he locates Scylla and Charybdis at present day St Michael's Mount. Evidence To support his hypothesis Wilkens uses archaeological evidence, for instance the Isleham Hoard in the battlefield, and etymological evidence, for instance the location of Ismaros in Brittany at Ys or the location of Homer's Sidon at Medina Sidonia in Spain. He also argues that Homer described locations around the Atlantic, with distinctive topographical features. He also believes that there are similarities in English river names and river names in near Troy in the Iliad and added a \\"reconstruction\\" of the Trojan battlefield in Cambridgeshire to his 2005 revised edition. C√°diz: Ithaca? C√°diz would match the description of Ithaca; There is in the land of Ithaca a certain harbour of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and at its mouth two projecting headlands sheer to seaward, but sloping down on the side toward the harbour...Odyssey 13, 96 Havana: Telepylos? Wilkens believes that Havana's topography greatly resembles the description of Telepylos:The harbour, about which on both sides a sheer cliff runs continuously, and projecting headlands opposite to one another stretch out at the mouth, and the entrance is narrow, ..., and the ships were moored within the hollow harbour, for therein no wave ever swelled, great or small, but all about was a bright calm......Odyssey 10, 77‚Äì96 Sources Wilkens mentions several sources for his ideas. Belgian lawyer Th√©ophile Cailleux wrote that Odysseus sailed the Atlantic Ocean, starting from Troy, which he situated near the Wash in England (1879). Karel Jozef de Graeve, member of the Flemish council, wrote that the historical and mythological background of Homer's work should be sought in Western Europe, around the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta (posthumously, 1806).Charles-Joseph de Grave, R√©publique des Champs √©lys√©es, ou, Monde ancien : ouvrage dans lequel on d√©montre principalement : que les Champs √©lys√©es et l'Enfer des anciens sont le nom d'une ancienne r√©publique d'hommes justes et religieux, situ√©e a l'extr√©mit√© septentrionale de la Gaule, et surtout dans les √Æles du Bas-Rhin : que cet Enfer a √©t√© le premier sanctuaire de l'initiation aux m·ª≥steres, et qu'Ulysse y a √©t√© initi√© ... : que les po√®tes Hom√®re et H√©siode sont originaires de la Belgique, &c.;, De l'imprimerie de P.-F. de Goesin- Verhaeghe, Gent, 1806; OCLC: 53145878 Reviews As a work of fringe history, Where Troy Once Stood was largely ignored by academics.

In The Independent's \\"Building a library\\" series Tom Holland recommended the work for those who \\"have had enough of scepticism\\" about the Trojan War legend and have \\"wondered why Ilium sounds a bit like Ilford\\".

Byrd Bridge, and west of Hal Greer Boulevard. Broad avenues and streets dominate the streetscape, creating for the most part an even grid pattern. Another business district is in Old Central City, known for its numerous antique shops and Heiner's Bakery. Several major industries line the river, from the Steel of West Virginia industrial complex next to Marshall University to Special Metals, located along the Guyandotte River in the Altizer neighborhood. The proximity of the Ohio River played an important role in the development of heavy industry in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Rust Belt deindustrialization era of the 1970s led to a decline in the industrial base and, subsequently, Huntington's population. The saving grace, in terms of employment, has been the steadily growing service sector. Two major hospitals, St. Mary's and Cabell-Huntington, have seen major expansion projects that have doubled their footprints during the past twenty years. The city's architecture contains a wealth of historic structures, most built during the boom of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Notable structures include the 12-story St. James Building (housing The First State Bank), with its huge Doric columns presenting a grand entrance to the ornate lobby. The West Virginia Building is a deep-red brick structure that looms over 4th Avenue. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest tower in the state, but it has since fallen to 18th, behind the office towers of Charleston. Numerous other notable buildings are scattered throughout the downtown, ranging from the beautifully restored Guaranty Bank and Trust Building to the high-rise Coal Exchange Building. Grand residential homes and mansions line Ritter Creek and the steep hills that loom behind it, many built by the railroad barons of the past.  Downtown  The West Virginia Building is one of the largest structures in Huntington.  Urban renewal  During the 1960s and 1970s, major urban renewal projects began in Huntington. Four square blocks between 3rd Avenue and what is now Veterans Memorial Boulevard were demolished. One block was utilized for the construction of the Huntington Civic Center, while another featured a Wendy's fast-food restaurant and an apartment building. Two square blocks remained a vast parking lot for the greater part of 30 years, bordered by 8th Street, Veterans Memorial Boulevard, 10th Street, and 3rd Avenue, and was nicknamed the Superblock. The inclusion of a Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant on a small corner parcel in the early 1990s was the only development along the Superblock. The urban renewal effort of the past also produced the Radisson Hotel complex along 3rd Avenue, a new Mack and Dave's storefront, and Heritage Station. It also spawned the pedestrian-only 9th Street Plaza. A new Holiday Inn hotel complex was constructed in 1998 between 8th and 9th streets. In 2004, construction began on Pullman Square, a lifestyle center, which consumed the remainder of the Superblock. It opened later that year. In July 2006, work began on the improved 9th Street Plaza, which features sidewalks, outdoor seating for restaurants, two travel lanes, and center angled parking. Brick pedestals were constructed that hold two spires from the former 6th Street Bridge, installed at the entrances to the plaza at 3rd and 5th avenues. The new 9th Street Plaza reopened on December 1, 2006, and creates a symbolic link between the Pullman Square district and the remainder of downtown. As a result of much needed downtown investment, numerous properties have been renovated or are in the process of renovations, and new storefronts and lofts are being constructed. One of the spin-offs from the construction of Pullman Square was the renovation of the 900 block of 3rd Avenue, which was nearly all vacant. The renovation of numerous facades elsewhere, such as the removal of metal sheathing over brickwork, have been ongoing. During the construction of Pullman Square, the renovations along the 900 block of 3rd Avenue commenced, with most storefronts now being rented out. On the Friday after Thanksgiving in 2007, Le Cook Store opened across from Pullman Square; the Marshall Community and Technical College's Culinary Institute, which offers cooking classes and sample food tastings, also opened. Another tenant, C.F. Reuschlein Jewelers, opened during the same month along the block. = New vision = On June 5, 1999, a study was unveiled for streetscape improvements, some of which was later incorporated as part of the Pullman Square and 9th Street Plaza projects. The study reported that the \\"old downtown of department stores\\" was gone and that successful downtowns of today need to attract \\"residential development in upper stories\\" in which retail stores would follow, and then offices and restaurants. Some of the recommendations included: * Revitalize downtown Huntington as a critical step in revitalizing the entire region's image and economy. * Increasing funding for the Huntington Main Street program. * Welcoming signs at 8th Street and 10th Street underpasses. * Develop the Superblock. * Encourage residential development in the upper floors of buildings. * Strengthen existing downtown retailers and add new retail, restaurant and entertainment venues. * Seek professional offices for the downtown. * Enhance the downtown's physical appearance. * \\"Improve vehicular and pedestrian access, flow and environments.\\" * Improve the perception of ample and convenient parking in the downtown. * Create a destination draw for the downtown based upon the combination of the area's \\"natural history, cultural history, museums, musical offerings and other special features.\\"  Heritage Station  During the height of the urban renewal projects of the 1960s and 1970s, community and local leaders became involved with the fund-raising efforts of the Cabell- Wayne Historical Society and the Collis P. Huntington Railroad Historical Society. The goal was to create a unique downtown shopping, dining, and entertainment complex with a mix of historical structures relocated from other sites in Huntington. Although it is now considered a \\"lifestyle center\\", it was at the time a rather novel idea in a push to get traffic into the downtown area. Heritage Village (now Heritage Station) was completed on September 2, 1977. It features the 1892 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad passenger station, a 1911 B&O; Railroad freight house, and the 1871 Bank of Huntington building. The railroad structures from the B&O; became obsolete in 1965 with the consolidation of its operations into the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in Huntington. The C&O; Railroad donated two boxcars, and the railroad historical society donated a steam engine and a Southern Railway sleeping car, also called a Pullman. Located at the corner of Veterans Memorial Blvd and 11th Street in Downtown Huntington, Heritage Station is now a well-attended lifestyle center, with lots eclectic, locally owned shops offering a variety of unique gifts including an artisan gift shop, a local market, a coffee shop and bakery, a wine bar, a fine cigar store, a beer and cheese shop, the first craft beer bar in town and a vintage clothing and jewelry shop, and others. Pullman Square, the centerpiece of Huntington's urban renewal efforts  Pullman Square  Pullman Square is a lifestyle center in downtown Huntington between 8th and 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard. It is located on what was known as the \\"Superblock\\", a large urban renewal project that saw the demolishing of four city-square blocks in 1970. The collection of one- and two-story structures includes the 16-screen movie theater, Marquee Cinemas. It also includes numerous retail establishments and restaurants. The Huntington Arcade is being renovated along Fourth Avenue.  Old Main  The Old Main Corridor project, envisioned originally as a streetscape redevelopment of 4th Avenue between Hal Greer Boulevard to 6th Street in downtown Huntington, was revamped and unveiled on October 31, 2006, at the Memorial Student Center of Marshall University. The goal is to connect the downtown and the university by \\"building off the success of Pullman Square.\\" The original plan, designed in 2003, entailed the construction of gardens and a public plaza along Hal Greer Boulevard at 4th and 5th avenues adjacent to Marshall University, along with the streetscape improvements. The gardens and public plazas were eliminated from the revamped plans due to cost. The new design is estimated to cost $2.5 million. Funding has been secured for the project between 9th and 10th streets along 4th Avenue with construction beginning in 2007. $350,000 has been requested in a federal transportation enhancement grant that would cover the cost of streetscape improvements between Hal Greer Boulevard and 12th Street; construction on that section could begin in 2008. The final result will include the repaving of 4th Avenue and the reduction of lanes from four to two‚Äîone lane in each direction with left-turn lanes at each intersection‚Äîand the addition of bike lanes from Hal Greer Boulevard to 6th Street; on-street parking will not be affected. New trees and street lights, similar to what was installed along 3rd Avenue near Pullman Square and along 9th Street, will be installed along 4th Avenue. Other safety improvement projects and traffic calming features, such as the replacing of sidewalks and curb extensions, will enhance pedestrian safety.  Kinetic Park  Kinetic Park is a technology park being developed along Interstate 64 in Huntington. There are two sections of Kenetic Park. The lower section of the park will be used for commercial businesses, and the upper section of the park will be used for technology startups and corporations. Currently, there are three commercial and eleven technology lots available.  Commercial outlots  The lower level of Kinetic Park has over available for commercial uses that will complement the Technology Park area. Intended uses include restaurants, lodging, banking, personal services and other retail businesses that can conveniently serve employees of the Technology Park and surrounding area. Currently only two tenants occupy the commercial level, a Bob Evans restaurant and a TownePlace Suites by Marriott.  Technology park  The upper level of Kinetic Park consists of nearly available for businesses that desire a signature location within a state-of-the-art high technology equipped office park. The first tenants, Huntington Dermatology and Sullivan Webb, were to move into a new structure in spring 2007.\\"New schools, businesses expected in Tri-State.\\" Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 1 Jan. 2007. 2 Jan. 2007 .

Lakes Zarasaitis and Grie≈ætas are connected by the River Laukesa. Zarasai holds the record for the highest recorded daytime temperature in Lithuania of 38.5 ¬∞C (2014). A few music festivals are held in Zarasai in summer. Such as: Mƒónuo Juodaragis, Roko naktys. Etymology The name of Zarasai is of Selonian origin. Lithuanian linguist Kazimieras B≈´ga explained its origins ‚Äì in Selonian language the word lake was pronounced as ezeras or ezaras, plural form ezerasai. During the time it was shortened to Zarasai. In Polish, the town was known since the first third of the 16th century as Jeziorosy, from jezioro meaning lake . In 1836, the town was renamed Novoalexandrovsk in honor of Tsar Nicholas I's son Alexander. This name was maintained until 1918. From 1919 to 1929, in the newly independent Lithuania, the town was called E≈æerƒónai, from e≈æeras, the Lithuanian word for lake. The Yiddish name Ezherene is derived from E≈æerƒónai. The current Lithuanian name Zarasai was adopted only in 1929. History Zarasai in 1864 Zarasai Park Dominykas Bukontas Monument The lands were inhabited by the Baltic tribe Selonians. The exact date of the city's foundation is unknown, but a date around the turn of the 15th/16th centuries is generally accepted and 1506 is the official date of foundation. At that time, a manor stood in the present town's territory, together with a monastery and church on Didzioji Island in Lake Zarasas. The settlement was located on one of the largest ancient trade-routes from Riga to Pskov. The settlement formed part of one of the domains of the diocese of Vilnius from the 14th century to the 18th century. Zarasai manor was mentioned in written sources at the end of the 15th century and in 1522 Zarasai was recorded as a small town. In 1598, Zarasai was termed a volost. In 1613, Zarasai was marked on a map of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, with the place-name written in Polish as Jeziorosa. By 1669, the town had a population of over 300. There were craftsmen's workshops and an inn, a network of streets and main roads to the nearby towns. However, further development was obstructed due to wars, diseases and fires. The Great Northern War and the plague at the beginning of the 18th century caused great damage to the small town and its citizens. According to an inventory of 1721, there were only 100 people living in the town, and the craftsmen did not develop their activities. The first Orthodox church of the Old Believers was built in Barauka, Zarasai, in 1735. Significant growth occurred during the second half of the 18th century, when a school and a customs agency were established; the agency issued permits to sell flax in Riga. In 1795 after the third partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Zarasai and nearby territories were taken over by the Russian Empire. Zarasai manor and the town were given to Vilnius Guberniya. Zarasai was on the road between St. Petersburg and Warsaw, construction of which began during the first half of the 19th century. The section from Zarasai to Kaunas was built in 1830‚Äì1836, which increased the commercial importance of the town. Monument to the completion of the Kaunas‚ÄìDaugavpils road Despite several confrontations between the Tsar's army and rebels near Zarasai, and a disastrous fire of 1834 that burned down practically the whole town centre, the population grew and the rebuilt town rapidly developed. In 1836, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia visited the town and was so impressed by the wonderful landscape that he decided to rename the town in the name of his son Alexander. As there were a few towns in the Empire named Aleksandrovsk, Zarasai was renamed Novo Aleksandrovsk and was so called from 1836 to 1918. At the same time, a coat of arms was granted and Zarasai County (Zarasai County covered an area of 7223 sq.m. in 1897), formed out of a part of Braslaw County, was attached to Kaunas Governorate. In 1837, the centre of Zarasai was rebuilt to a new plan, with a central horseshoe-shaped square bounded by a road, from which a network of streets radiated. The intention was to prevent major fires - Zarasai is the only town in Lithuania which has such a plan, which has remained to this day without any major changes. Zarasai was liberated from the Bolsheviks at the end of August 1919, and in that year a Lithuanian name, Ezerenai, was given to the town. Since linguists discovered this name to be of Selonian origin, the name was changed in 1929 to Zarasai. In 1924, the designation of Zarasai county was finally approved and public offices of the independent Lithuania were developed in the town. During the period of independence, Zarasai was an important summer resort for holidaymakers who came from all over Lithuania. During World War II, Zarasai was under German occupation from 25 June 1941 until 29 July 1944 and administered as part of the Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland. On August 26, 1941, 2,569 Jews from the Zarasai area were murdered near the village of Deguƒçiai by an Einsatzgruppe of Germans and Lithuanian collaborators.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search/vcntfr=1000.vcntto=5000/page/1/item/185/ In 2010, the Zarasai Region became one of the European Destinations of Excellence.

In addition to the central business district, the area also consists of the Brickell Financial District, Historic District, Government Center, Arts & Entertainment District and Park West. The neighborhood is divided by the Miami River and is bordered by Midtown (Edgewater and Wynwood) to the north, Biscayne Bay to the east, Civic Center and Overtown to the west, and Coconut Grove to the south. Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard are the main north‚Äìsouth roads, and Flagler Street is the main east‚Äìwest road. The neighborhood is defined by the Miami Downtown Development Authority (DDA) as the -area east of Interstate 95 between the Rickenbacker Causeway to the south and Julia Tuttle Causeway to the north. Locally known as Downtown, the area is a cultural, financial, and commercial center of South Florida, tracing its present-day history back to the 19th century. In recent years, Downtown Miami has grown and physically expanded to become the fastest-growing area in Miami, with rapid increase in population and the greatest concentration of high-rises in the region. Greater Downtown is home to many major museums, parks, education centers, banks, company headquarters, courthouses, government offices, theaters, shops and many of the oldest buildings in the city. History Downtown skyline circa 1930s, with the Florida East Coast Railway passenger train station and the Dade County Courthouse in the foreground Downtown Miami is the historic heart of Miami, and along with Coconut Grove, is the oldest settled area of Miami, with early pioneer settlement dating to the early 19th century. Urban development began in the 1890s with the construction of the Florida East Coast Railway by Standard Oil industrialist Henry Flagler down to Miami at the insistence of Julia Tuttle. Flagler, along with developers such as William Brickell and George E. Merrick helped bring developer interest to the city with the construction of hotels, resorts, homes, and the extension of Flagler's rail line. Flagler Street, originating in Downtown, is a major east‚Äìwest road in Miami named after the tycoon; the Julia Tuttle Causeway, crossing Biscayne Bay just north of Downtown in Edgewater, is named in honor of Tuttle. As of 2009, there are approximately 71,000 year-round residents in Greater Downtown (including Downtown's Brickell, Park West, and Arts & Entertainment District neighborhoods), with close to 200,000 populating the Downtown area during the daytime, making Downtown Miami one of the most populous downtowns in the U.S. after New York City and Chicago.

Transit Miami Tri-Rail expansion In the 2025 and 2030 long range transportation plans, Miami's commuter rail system, Tri-Rail, has envisioned moving to or adding service on the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) corridor, which runs along the region's densest neighborhoods, parallel to Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, and Federal Highway in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Tri-Rail service on the FEC line would bring Tri-Rail to Downtown's transit hub, Government Center Station, connecting Downtown directly to Midtown Miami/Miami Design District, Upper East Side/Miami Shores, North Miami, North Miami Beach/Aventura, Downtown Hollywood, and Downtown Fort Lauderdale. Currently, rail commuters must transfer onto the Metrorail in Hialeah to get to Downtown. Miami's Downtown Development Authority along with Miami-area politicians are actively lobbying to bring Tri-Rail to the city core.Miami Downtown Development Authority hashing out plans to bring Tri-Rail downtown Taxis Taxis are popular in Downtown, especially from Downtown to South Beach, Design District or to Coconut Grove.

Biography He was born in New York City, the son of Frederick Wheatley, once a favorite actor in Baltimore and Philadelphia. His mother was Sarah (Ross) Wheatley, who died in 1873. She was an admirable and a justly renowned actress. He inherited talent for acting, together with a predilection for the stage. His first public appearance was made when he was a child, on October 13, 1826, at the Park Theatre, as \\"Albert\\" in William Tell, during an engagement played by Macready, who expressed approbation of the boy, and encouraged expectation of his success. In 1833 he was at the Bowery Theatre, acting walking-gentlemen (subordinate parts requiring dress and deportment as the chief qualifications). In 1834 he returned to the Park Theatre and was assigned to such parts as Laertes, Henry Moreland, Charles Courtly, Sir Thomas Clifford, Alfred Evelyn, and Claude Melnotte. He first attracted unusual notice there in the drama of \\"Rienzi.\\" On September 22, 1842, Wheatley appeared at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, as Doricourt, in \\"The Belle's Stratagem\\" ‚Äî a character which always remained a favorite with him, and in which, as in Rover in \\"Wild Oats,\\" he delighted the public by his energetic vivacity and sun-bright merriment. His success in Philadelphia was brilliant and he became a popular favorite and long continued to be. On March 24, 1843, Wheatley took a farewell benefit at the Chestnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, and temporarily retired from the Stage. In 1847 he played a star engagement at the Park Theatre, New York, in conjunction with his brilliant sister Emma Wheatley, afterward Mrs. James Mason. At about that time he visited Nicaragua, and it is said that the first American flag flown there was raised by his hands, ‚Äî on the shore of Virgin Bay. In 1853 he became associated with John Drew in the direction of the Arch Street Theatre, Philadelphia, and there he continued to manage and act, ‚Äî at first with Drew, then alone, and then with John Sleeper Clarke, ‚Äî till the spring of 1861. In the spring of 1862, after acting at Niblo's Garden in the Wallack-Davenport Combination, he leased that theatre, and he continued to manage it until the autumn of 1868 (producing the record-breaking and historically important The Black Crook in 1866), when he sold his interest to Messrs. Jarrett & Palmer and finally retired from management and from the Stage. He died in New York City on November 3, 1876.

While not a major artist, he was an innovator, creating a new style of watercolor painting.  History  Ludwig Mestler was born in Vienna on August 25, 1891 to Joseph and Jenny Kuten Mestler. His father was a choir singer in the Imperial Opera House (now called the Vienna State Opera), where he sang under Gustav Mahler, and also in Vienna's oldest synagogue. As a child Ludwig became devoted to both art and music but, acceding to his parents' that he should receive professional training, after finishing Realschule in 1910, he proceeded to Technische Universit√§t Wien from which he graduated in 1916 an Engineer Architect, the equivalent of a Masters of Architecture. After three years of military service, during which he rose to the rank of first lieutenant engineer, he worked as a professional engineer for seven years, during which period his pay rose from $19.00 a week to $80.00 a week. He immigrated to the US on February 11, 1923, on the Steam Ship Hanover. In 1927, he became a registered architect in New York state. On August 14 of the same year he married Miss Wilma Allerhand. This marriage resulted in stress on both sides, and three years later Mestler left his wife to take a job outside New York City. They never reunited. In 1932 Mestler brought action for annulment of their marriage which was granted in 1934. The Depression following the stock market crash of 1929 made it difficult for Mestler to obtain employment, and this he took as a sign that the time had come for him to give up his architectural career, for which he never cared, and to do what he had always longed to do by exclusively devoting himself to art. After becoming a US citizen on March 16, 1931, he decide to return to his native Austria where the money he had saved during his years as an architect would last him longer. Back in his homeland, he applied himself industriously to the study of etching, drawing and painting. He studied under Arthur Paunzen and for three years at the Akademie der Bildenden Kunste in Vienna, where in his last year, 37-38, he worked successfully under Karl Sterrer in the Meisterschule fur Malerei. He also found time for travel and took a Mediterranean cruise in addition to seeing much of Austria and Italy. These were productive years producing many sketches, watercolors and etchings. An etching of this period, \\"A View of Sievering\\", gave him his first recognition in the United States as it was included in the 4th International Exhibition of Etching and Engraving at the Chicago Art Institute. It later toured the country in a museum exhibition of the nation's best etching. In Austria he acquired an avid collector in Dr. Fritz Eisenberger, an art historian, who bought some twenty watercolors and one or more copies of all the etching Mestler produced in Austria. He had a one-man show in Vienna in 1936. Judengasse Street, watercolor 1933 by Ludwig Mestler The advent of Hitler to Austria brought Mestler back to the United States on the . This time he settled in the Boston area, first in Brookline and later in Cambridge. Throwing himself wholeheartedly into the practice of art, this was a productive period for him. It was at this time that he developed his highly individualistic parallel stroke technique in watercolor. His work was represented in a number of art exhibits, and he had two one man shows: one at the Worcester Art Museum in 1939 and one at Boston's Symphony Hall in 1941. Etchings were purchased by several leading museums and many private collectors. Kirche im der Krim, etching by Ludwig Mestler Despite this success, Ludwig Mestler was unable to support himself at his art. Not only was he temperamentally unsuited to supplementing his income by teaching or lecturing, but he developed ideas about the value of his pictures which made it impossible to sell them. For instance, a friend relates that he indignantly turned down an offer by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts to buy one of his watercolors for $250.00. A temporary solution to his financial problem was provided by the WPA art project which employed him for two years. When that work ceased, illness ensued and he had his first experience as the recipient of charity ‚Äì first through a private and later a public organization. Friends pulled strings and got him a position with Stone and Webster. This proved one of the pivotal points in his life, comparing work at a job he disliked to receiving public relief, as he had done for the first time the year before, he gave up the latter and resigned from Stone and Webster after only three months. He never worked at another job or paid income tax again. It was at this time he began to feel an interest in music. He didn't know music theory at the time. He acquired a music library through friends and plunged into the study of harmony and counterpoint. He struggled alone with this for years only gradually gaining the attention and interest of local professors, top men in their field, who helped him over some of the more difficult hurdles in his musical education. Song cycles and various small pieces of chamber music began to emerge and he found student musician glad to perform them for him. The apathy regarding his music began to dissolve. He wrote in 1958, \\"Musicians start to take to my work ‚Äì resistance is diminishing visibly.\\" He began making mastersheets. In 1958 he had the satisfaction of having a student recital of his work at the Longy School in Cambridge devoted entirely to his work. However, in the opinion of many who knew him, Ludwig Mestler's talent as an artist was far greater than his talent as a composer. And while he continued to sketch, make pencil portraits and experiment with oils, he stopped producing watercolors. The Board of Welfare was willing to pay for his regular expenses but not for private vacations in the country. Private charitable organizations, on several occasions, made it possible for him to convalesce in the country after illness and several friends turned over cottages in the mountains or the seaside. But such experiences were infrequent and year sometimes followed year before he was able to get out of the city again. In 1958 he wrote, \\"I long to return to Nature, then I could paint again.\\" To Mestler, the freedom from non-artistic toil which relief money gave him was highly important and he would become furious with friends who tried to find him jobs. Yet he paid a high price for acceptance of public charity, for it placed him in a humble, often humiliating position which his sensitive nature often found intolerable. As years wore on, he became increasingly unhappy and embittered, and more and more governed by feelings of frustration, futility and failure, seeing slights and rebuffs where none existed. In June 1955 he wrote in his diary, a series of draft letters mostly never sent, \\"I am very depressed over my hopeless situation in life.\\" In November 1957 he confided,\\"‚Ä¶I feel‚Ä¶utterly lost and isolated. All my efforts in obeying the demands nature have been in vain and there is nowhere, even a trace of an indication that things will turn for the better. All I can hope, later on, my for will speak for me and explain me in the heart and brain of a very few people at a time when I will not know it any more.\\" In the winter of 1958-59 Ludwig Mestler fell on the ice, hitting his head. Late in February he was taken to Beth Israel Hospital, apparently suffering from brain injury. On March 20 he died there and through the offices of the Hebrew Free Burial Society was laid to rest in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in West Roxbury. He is buried in the section Shara Tfilo. Friends took up a collections to provide a headstone for this strange, gentle, persistent man of art and music.  From His Journals  Great Pleasure: \\"Matisse has great maturity, and the temper of the eternal pupil, he is always willing to learn anyhow, anywhere, and from anyone.\\" Leo Stein, Appreciation: Painting, Poetry and Prose. This sentence gives me great pleasure. To think that this was the attitude of one of the finest artist since the French Impressionist! I like it because it is my own attitude, only that I am no Matisse. Ludwig Mestler 17. X. 1957 Complicated Life: We have allowed our life to become exceedingly complicated. But even now it is still possible to find, here and there an individual that loves simplicity and tries, whenever he can to eliminate or reduce complicated and replace it with simple. This task in itself is complicated, or should I say, complex, and yet again simple, because it means as often to avoid things, or methods, as to use other things or other methods. Ludwig Mestler 15. IX. 1957  Critical Responses  An interview with Arthur Polonsky concerning the three man show he shared with Ludwig Mestler: \\"They had a three-man show, at that time, which must have been in the early fall of 1948, I was one of the three artists and a man named Ludwig Mestler, who was . . . an older European artist who had settled in the Boston area, not well known, and Panos Ghikas. But each one of us represented an obviously different approach in painting. Ghikas was in what was then considered to be a geometric or abstract style, and Mestler, representational, but very much personalized, somewhat close to Lyonel Feininger, Klee; kind of quiet, small format, beautifully drawn, and so on. . And my work which I suppose seemed to some to be at least characteristic, if not typical, of what was going on then among some of the people emerging, for example, from the Museum School, Boston artists of a younger age. A 3-man show. It was widely reported, the show. It got into Art News, for example, in New York, with serious and lengthy reviews.\\"  Legacy  When the garret room he occupied for the last three and a half years of his life was examined after his death, the walls were lined with stacks of fruit crates containing his extensive library and most of the floor was covered with packing crates full of most of a lifetime's artistic output. While there has been some discussion about his mental health, it seems to exist as a misguided approach to selling his work to an increasingly superficial and uneducated market. Commentary on his journals points to a highly educated person who just happened to be in an unfortunate situation for most of his life in the US. His work now hangs in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. and the Hirshhorn Gallery, which is an extension of the Smithsonian Institution. While not a member of any of the major movements of the 20th century, the fingerprints of his influence can be seen in the work of artists as diverse as R. Crumb and Alexis Covato. Like many people uprooted or destroyed by the Nazi Occupation of Europe, his life and memory were nearly lost.

It took its name from Leon Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution. The group dissolved itself on 28 March 2013.  History  The group was founded after a two-year dispute against the perspectives adopted by the L5I at its 2003 congress.Article #632 Weekly Worker It first organised as a tendency, then as a faction.A few words on the Workers Power split, July 6, 2006 KitNotes.co.uk The split followed a discussion of how to assess the impact, on class politics in general and the level of class struggle, of two changes: # The effect of the restoration of capitalism in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1990. # The defeats of the working class movement in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom. The group gathered together a minority which argued that almost without exception the international left had undertaken no serious reexamination of world perspectives and economy since a \\"stagnation phase\\" in the 1970s and 1980s.Revolution round the corner?; Workers' Liberty Home, 16 July 2006 It felt that as a result the international left had been unable to explain either the marginalisation of the left or the failure of important protest movements against capitalism (such as the anti-capitalist movement, anti-war movement and Social Forum movements) to sink significant roots into the world working-class.World economy, politics and the class struggle: the international perspectives of the International Permanent RevolutionMore on the Workers' Power split Tuesday, July 04, 2006] Permanent Revolution argued the L5I perspectives adopted at their Sixth Congress in 2003 that the engine of the world economy had \\"halted\\", that world capitalism was in a \\"period of stagnation\\" and as a result the world faced a \\"pre- revolutionary period\\" were fundamentally inaccurate and the refusal of the L5I to correct these perspectives in the light of experience proved they had decisively broken from the method of revolutionary Trotskyism. In contrast, Permanent Revolution argued that the integration of the former workers states into world capitalism, when combined with the defeats of the working class in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, had allowed capitalism to revive itself through globalisation.International /Globalisation Furthermore, it argued that while the working class movement was no longer in the counter revolutionary phase of the 1990s, the movement had still not fully recovered from those defeats and rather was in a transitional period, with uneven struggles, not yet usually generalised or sustained.2007: Prospects for the class struggle  Theory  Permanent Revolution claimed to stand in the tradition of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and for the revolutionary programme developed by the early Comintern and the early Fourth International. However, it differed from other Trotskyist organisations in three ways: # Permanent Revolution believed that Trotskyism requires a \\"perspective\\" as the most concrete assessment of the situation must be made in order to enable the application of revolutionary Marxist ideas to the real situation of the class struggle at any given moment. It emphasised Marx's view that it is necessary to understand the world in order to change it.Theses On Feuerbach Karl Marx, edited by Friedrich Engels # Permanent Revolution considered the League for the Fifth International (LRCI) to have been a healthy period within Trotskyism and saw itself as following on from the LCRI which also argued that the Fourth International had degenerated after the Second World War because of a refusal to fundamentally reassess its perspectives.The Fourth International fails to reassess Trotsky's post war perspectives Permanent Revolution It felt that through a similar refusal the L5I suffered a similar process of disorientation and degeneration which culminated in the L5I abandoning the Trotskyist programme as a method of intervention into the actual class struggle. # Permanent Revolution paid special interest to an analysis of how globalisation offsets the tendency of the rate of profit to decline and enables capitalism to escape the stagnation period which defined the world economy through the 1970s and 1980s.  Members  At its inauguration in London in July 2006, Permanent Revolution claimed to have had 33 members.Background on the Workers' Power split workersliberty.orgThe Split in the League for the Fifth International permanentrevolution.net Its founding meeting involved participants from Britain, Ireland, Chile, Czech Republic, Sweden, Australia, Austria and observers from Argentina.

M√≠misbrunnr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. The well is located beneath one of three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil, a root that passes into the land of the frost j√∂tnar where the primordial plane of Ginnungagap once existed. In addition, the Prose Edda relates that the water of the well contains much wisdom, and that Odin sacrificed one of his eyes to the well in exchange for a drink. Attestations=Poetic Edda \\"Odin at the Brook Mimir\\" (1893) by John Angell James Brindley In the Poetic Edda poem V√∂lusp√°, a v√∂lva recounts to Odin that she knows that Odin once placed one of his eyes in M√≠misbrunnr as a pledge, and that M√≠mir drinks from the well every morning: > {  :Benjamin Thorpe translation: :\\"Of what wouldst thou ask me? :Why > temptest thou me? :Odin! I know all, :where thou thine eye didst sink :in > the pure well of Mim.\\" :Mim drinks from mead each morn :from Valfather's > pledge.Thorpe (1866:6).  :Henry Adams Bellows translation: :I know where > Othin's eye is hidden, :Deep in the wide-famed well of Mimir; :Mead from the > pledge of Othin each morn :Does Mimir drink: would you know yet more?Bellows > (1936:13).  } The above stanza is absent from the Hauksb√≥k manuscript version of the poem. Elsewhere in the poem, the v√∂lva mentions a scenario involving the hearing or horn (depending on translation of the Old Norse noun hlj√≥√∞‚Äîbolded for the purpose of illustration) of the god Heimdallr: > {  :Benjamin Thorpe translation: :She knows that Heimdall's horn is hidden > :under the heaven-bright holy tree. :A river she sees flow, with foamy fall, > :from Valfather's pledge. :Understand ye yet, or what?Thorpe (1866:7).  > :Henry Adams Bellows translation: :I know of the horn of Heimdall, hidden > :Under the high-reaching holy tree; :On it there pours from Valfather's > pledge :A mighty stream: would you know yet more?Bellows (1932:12).  > :Carolyne Larrington translation: :She knows that Heimdall's hearing is > hidden :under the radiant, sacred tree; :she sees, pouring down, the muddy > torrent :from the wager of Father of the Slain; do you :understand yet, or > what more?Larrington (1999:7). } Scholar Paul Schach comments that the stanzas in this section of Voluspa are \\"all very mysterious and obscure, as it was perhaps meant to be\\". Schach details that \\"Heimdallar hlj√≥√∞ has aroused much speculation. Snorri seems to have confused this word with gjallarhorn, but there is otherwise no attestation of the use of hlj√≥√∞ in the sense of 'horn' in Icelandic. Various scholars have read this as \\"hearing\\" rather than \\"horn\\".Schach (1985:93). Scholar Carolyne Larrington comments that if \\"hearing\\" rather than \\"horn\\" is understood to appear in this stanza, the stanza indicates that Heimdall, like Odin, has left a body part in the well; his ear. Larrington says that \\"Odin exchanged one of his eyes for wisdom from Mimir, guardian of the well, while Heimdall seems to have forfeited his ear.\\"Larrington (1999:265). Prose Edda In chapter 15 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, the enthroned figure High tells Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) about Yggdrasil. High details that Yggdrasil has three roots. One of these roots reaches to where the primordial space of Ginnungagap once existed and where now the frost j√∂tnar live. High explains that, beneath this root is M√≠misbrunnr and that the well contains \\"wisdom and intelligence\\" and \\"the master of the well is called Mimir. He is full of learning because he drinks of the well from the horn Giallarhorn. All-father went there and asked for a single drink from the well, but he did not get one until he placed his eye as a pledge.\\" After his explanation, High quotes the stanza involving Odin and the well from V√∂lusp√°.Faulkes (1995:17).

Chua graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. She is the John M. Duff Jr. Professor of Law at Yale Law School. Her expertise is in international business transactions, law and development, ethnic conflict, and globalization and the law. She joined the Yale faculty in 2001 after teaching at Duke Law School for seven years. Prior to starting her teaching career, she was a corporate law associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. She is also known for her parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. In 2011, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people, one of The Atlantic Brave Thinkers, and one of Foreign Policy Global Thinkers.  Family background  Chua was born in Champaign, Illinois, to ethnic Chinese parents with Hoklo ancestry who emigrated from the Philippines. Her parents raised her speaking Hokkien. Her father, Leon O. Chua, is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.Chua, Leon O. (September 1971). \\"Memristor - The Missing Circuit Element\\". IEEE Transactions on Circuits Theory (IEEE) 18 (5): 507‚Äì519. His ancestral hometown is Quanzhou, Fujian. Chua's mother was born in China in 1936, before moving to the Philippines at the age of two. She subsequently converted to Catholicism in high school and graduated from the University of Santo Tomas, with a degree in Chemical Engineering, summa cum laude. Chua's parents lived in the Philippines during the Japanese occupation in World War II and were liberated by General Douglas MacArthur and his troops. Early life and education  Chua was raised Catholic and lived in West Lafayette, Indiana. When she was 8 years old, her family moved to Berkeley, California. Chua described herself as an \\"ugly kid\\" during her school days; she was bullied in school for her foreign accent (which she has since lost) and was the target of racial slurs from several classmates, even in California. She went to El Cerrito High School, where she graduated as valedictorian of her class. In college, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude with an A.B. in Economics in 1984 from Harvard College, where she was named an Elizabeth Cary Agassiz Scholar and a John Harvard Scholar. She obtained her J.D. cum laude in 1987 from Harvard Law School, where she was the first Asian American officer of the Harvard Law Review, serving as executive editor.Yale Law School  Faculty  Curriculum Vitae After law school, Chua clerked for Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Washington, D.C.  Books  Chua has written five books: two studies of international affairs, a parenting memoir, a book on ethnic- American culture and its correlation with socio-economic success within the United States, and a book about the role of tribal loyalties in American politics and its foreign policy. Her first book, World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability (2003), explores the ethnic conflict caused in many societies by disproportionate economic and political influence of \\"market dominant minorities\\" and the resulting resentment in the less affluent majority. World on Fire, which was a New York Times bestseller, selected by The Economist as one of the Best Books of 2003, and named by Tony Giddens in The Guardian as one of the \\"Top Political Reads of 2003\\", examines how globalization and democratization since 1989 have affected the relationship between market-dominant minorities and the wider population. Her second book, Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance ‚Äì and Why They Fall (2007), examines seven major empires and posits that their success depended on their tolerance of minorities. Chua's third book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, published in January 2011, is a memoir about her parenting journey using strict Confucianist child rearing techniques, which she describes as being typical for Chinese immigrant parents. Despite being sometimes interpreted as a how-to manual for parenting, the book has been critically viewed as an account \\"of how children can become rebellious and alienated when one-size-fits-all education philosophies are applied, regardless of their personality or aptitudes.\\" It was an international bestseller in the United States, South Korea, Poland, Israel, Germany, United Kingdom, and China, and has been translated into 30 languages. The book also received a huge backlash and media attention and ignited global debate about different parenting techniques and cultural attitudes that foster such techniques.Emily Rauhala (14 August 2014) 'Tiger Mother': Are Chinese Moms Really So Different? Time. Retrieved 8 March 2014 Furthermore, the book provoked uproar after the release where Chua received death threats, racial slurs, and calls for her arrest on child-abuse charges. Her fourth book, co- written with husband Jed Rubenfeld, is The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America (published in February 2014). The book received positive reviews from a number of sources. Lucy Kellaway, writing for Financial Times, called it \\"the best universal theory of success I've seen.\\" The Guardian commended the book for \\"draw[ing] on eye-opening studies of the influence of stereotypes and expectations on various ethnic and cultural groups ... The authors' willingness to pursue an intellectual inquiry that others wouldn't is bracing.\\" The book was also criticized because of what some described as cultural stereotyping. An empirical study by Joshua Hart and Christopher F. Chabris found that \\"There was little evidence for the Triple Package theory.\\" Chua also appears in author J. D. Vance's memoir and bestseller, Hillbilly Elegy. Chua's student at Yale, Vance wrote that she gave him \\"the best advice anyone has ever given me.\\" Vance wrote in his acknowledgments, \\"Besides Tina, the person who deserves the most credit for this book's existence is Amy Chua, my Yale contracts professor, who convinced me that both my life and the conclusions I drew from it were worth putting down on paper.\\" Vance credits Chua as the \\"authorial godmother\\" of Hillbilly Elegy. In February 2018, Chua's fifth book was published. Titled Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations, it covers the topic of how loyalty to groups often outweighs ideological considerations. She examines how a failure to realize this has played a role in both the failure of US foreign policy abroad and the rise of Donald Trump domestically. The book received overwhelming positive reviews from across the political spectrum. David Frum, writing for The New York Times, praised Chua for her willingness to approach \\"the no-go areas around which others usually tiptoe.\\" The Washington Post described the book as \\"compact, insightful, disquieting, yet ultimately hopeful,\\"Jonathan Rauch, \\"Have our tribes become more important than our country?\\", The Washington Post, Retrieved 2018-03-30. and Ezra Klein called the book \\"fascinating\\" on his Vox podcast.Ezra Klein, \\"The Ezra Klein Show\\", The Ezra Klein Show, 2018-02-26. The book received a few criticisms. The Guardian called it \\"a well-intentioned book that never quite comes together.\\" The Financial Times stated that it was \\"an important book,\\" and supported Chua's argument \\"that America's liberal elite has contributed to Trump's rise by failing to acknowledge its own sense of tribalism\\"; it did, however, also state that it left the \\"crucial question\\" of how to create a \\"non-tribal world\\" unanswered. J.D. Vance, a former student of Chua and author of Hillbilly Elegy, praised the book, saying that \\"Political Tribes is a beautifully written, eminently readable, and uniquely important challenge to conventional wisdom.\\" Kavanaugh clerkships Chua has recommended a large number of candidates that have gone on to clerk for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, previously a prominent federal judge on the D.C. Circuit. Controversy has arisen from allegations that Chua \\"groomed\\" potential clerks for the job by advising them to dress and act a certain way, so as to secure employment with Kavanaugh. On September 20, 2018, The Guardian reported that Chua and another prominent Yale law professor had advised female law students at Yale that their physical attractiveness and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Chua reportedly stated that female law students should exude a \\"model-like\\" femininity and \\"dress outgoing\\" in their job interview with him, and that it was \\"no coincidence\\" that Kavanaugh's female clerks all \\"looked like models.\\" Jed Rubenfeld, Amy Chua's husband, reportedly stated that Kavanaugh \\"hires women with a certain look.\\" Chua denied the allegations, pointing out that her own daughter was approved for such a position with him. Yale Law School Dean Heather K. Gerken stated that the allegations reported by the Guardian were \\"of enormous concern to me and the school,\\" which investigates all complaints concerning violations of Yale University rules. In a statement to The Guardian in response to the report, Chua denied the notion that Kavanaugh's hiring was impacted by the attractiveness of female clerks. She stated that, \\"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\\" Yale subsequently did not find cause to sanction Chua, and she resumed regular teaching in the 2019-20 school year. She later told The Guardian that her classes were \\"among the most popular at the law school, especially for women and minorities,\\" and that she was nominated for a Yale Law Women teaching award in 2019.  Personal life  Chua and her daughters at the 2011 Time 100 gala Chua lives in New Haven, Connecticut, and is married to Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld. She has two daughters, Sophia and Louisa (\\"Lulu\\"). The former appeared in the New Yorker as a Harvard member of Kappa Alpha Theta and the ROTC. She said she was unprepared for the spotlight when Tiger Mother was released, and her membership in the latter two groups were part of a way to find normalcy. She also said that she envisions being a military prosecutor, with a focus on sexual assault.Marantz, Andrew, \\"Ink: The Tiger Cub Speaks,\\" The New Yorker, Feb. 10, 2014, p.20, 22. Sophia graduated from Yale Law School in 2018; she majored in philosophy and South Asian Studies for her undergraduate studies. On June 10, 2019, the Associated Press reported that Sophia would clerk for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Lulu is a student at Harvard Law School, as well as a graduate of Harvard College, where she majored in history and was president of the Sab Club.

It was published in 2006 by Nation Books. The book is a liberal response to Bernard Goldberg's book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America, and includes criticism of Republican politicians including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Rick Santorum. The book received positive reception in Publishers Weekly and The Nation. Reference & Research Book News called the book \\"the liberal polemical riposte\\" of 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. The book includes quotes attributed to American radio host and conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh, without providing a date or details about the quotes. When Limbaugh was in dealings to purchase a portion of the American football team, the St. Louis Rams in 2009, the quotes were reported in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Limbaugh disputed the quotes. The author of the book and its publisher both declined to comment to Associated Press. Legal analysts told Fox News Channel that Limbaugh could have a case for a libel lawsuit. Author In June 2006, Jack Huberman resided in New York City. Prior to authoring 101 People Who Are Really Screwing America, Huberman wrote the book The Bush-Hater's Handbook: a Guide to the Most Appalling Presidency of the Past 100 Years. He is also the author of Bushit: An A-Z Guide to the Bush Attack on Truth, Justice, Equality, and the American Way. Huberman was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he spent his early life. Contents The book is a liberal response to Bernard Goldberg's 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. The top-listed individuals are typically Republican politicians, such as George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Rick Santorum, and conservative judges such as Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Cheney is ranked in first place, and Bush in second. Others criticized in the book include Ann Coulter, Laura Schlessinger, drivers of SUVs, editors of The Wall Street Journal, Fox News Channel, J.K. Rowling, Dan Brown, and Candace Bushnell. Bernard Goldberg is ranked number 73 in the book, as in the subtitle, itself a reference to the subtitle of Goldberg's original book: \\"And Al Franken is #37.\\" Reception A review in Publishers Weekly described the book as a \\"droll and acerbic refresher course on the issues confronting the 21st-century United States\\". The review concluded: \\"Though Huberman takes his readers' sympathies for granted, the unabashedly leftwing bias and sheer breadth of this frontal assault on Republican politics and culture are factually convincing. ... overall Huberman serves up a frothy indictment to warm liberal innards.\\" Reference & Research Book News characterized the book as a \\"the liberal polemical riposte\\" of 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America by Bernard Goldberg. The book was highlighted in the blog \\"Editor's Cut\\" published by The Nation. Writing for The Nation, Katrina Vanden Heuvel commented: \\"In this witty book, Huberman lays out in well-researched detail the interlocking relationships within the vast rightwing agenda to undermine our democratic institutions for profit and prophesy.\\" 2009 Rush Limbaugh quote controversy A quote on page 232 of the book is attributed to American radio host and conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh: \\"Let‚Äôs face it, we didn‚Äôt have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing. Quite the opposite: Slavery built the South. I‚Äôm not saying we should bring it back. I‚Äôm just saying it had its merits. For one thing, the streets were safer after dark.\\" Huberman's book does not provide a date for the quote or any other details about it. Another quote from page 232 of the book attributed to Limbaugh is \\"You know who deserves a posthumous Medal of Honor? James Earl Ray. We miss you, James. Godspeed.\\" Ray assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. In 2009, Limbaugh was in dealings to purchase a portion of the American football team, the St. Louis Rams. In the context of reporting on Limbaugh's attempts to purchase the St. Louis Rams, the quote attributed to Limbaugh in the book was printed in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in October 2009. The St. Louis Post- Dispatch did not attempt to verify the quote, beyond its attribution to Limbaugh in the book. The quote also appeared attributed to Limbaugh in other news publications, including the Detroit Free Press, and The Washington Post. The quote was repeated on CNN and MSNBC. In a program on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow attributed the quote involving James Earl Ray from the Huberman book to Limbaugh. Limbaugh initially stated he was unable to recall saying the statement in the quotes in question. After Limbaugh's staff researched the quotes and were unable to find reference to them other than the book, Limbaugh emailed the Associated Press a statement: \\"The totally made-up and fabricated quotes attributed to me in recent media reports are outrageous and slanderous.\\" Limbaugh stated on his radio program: \\"There's a quote out there that I first saw it in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last week that I somehow, some time ago, defended slavery and started cracking jokes about it. And, you know, you say a lot of things in the course of 15 hours a week, over the course of 21 years. We've gone back, we have looked at everything we have. There is not even an inkling that any words in this quote are accurate. It's outrageous, but it's totally predictable. It's being repeated by people who have never listened to this program, they certainly didn't hear it said themselves because it was never said.\\" The reporting of the quote and its attribution to Limbaugh hurt his attempts to purchase the St. Louis Rams, and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell stated he did not think the quotes attributed to Limbaugh \\"accurately reflect the league and its players\\". On October 14, 2009, Limbaugh was dropped from the group attempting to buy the St. Louis Rams, due to the controversy of his participation in the deal. According to chairman of the St. Louis Blues hockey team Dave Checketts, who was behind the group attempting to purchase the St. Louis Rams, Limbaugh's participation in the endeavor had become a \\"complication and a distraction\\". James Taranto of The Wall Street Journal reported that the quotes may have originated in September 2005 from a blogger who initially discovered them on a Wikipedia page. Toby Harnden of The Daily Telegraph reported that the quotes originated on Wikipedia and Wikiquote, prior to making it into Huberman's book. On October 15, 2009, the Associated Press contacted Huberman as well as the book's publisher, and asked for the source of the quotes. Huberman told the Associated Press he had no comment about the source of the quotes, and the book's publisher also declined to comment. The Huffington Post had previously published the quote in a blog post by Huberman where he excerpted a portion of his book on the website. The Huffington Post later deleted the offending quotes from Huberman's post, and posted an \\"Editor's Note\\", which stated that Huberman was not able to substantiate the quotes he had attributed to Limbaugh: \\"An earlier version of this post contained quotes attributed to Rush Limbaugh, which Limbaugh has since denied making. As is our policy when a fact in a blog post is called into question, we gave its author 24 hours to substantiate the quote. Since he has not been able to do so, the quotes have been deleted from the post.\\" The president of the conservative media watchdog organization Media Research Center, Brent Bozell, called for CNN and MSNBC to prove Limbaugh said the offending statement, or retract and apologize for repeating it. On October 16, 2009, both CNN and MSNBC issued statements regarding their restating the quotes attributed to Limbaugh. \\"We should not have reported it ‚Äì not have reported it ‚Äì without independent confirmation, and for that I apologize,\\" said CNN's Rick Sanchez. \\"MSNBC attributed that quote to a football player who was opposed to Limbaugh's NFL bid. However, we have been unable to verify that quote independently. So, just to clarify,\\" said David Shuster in a clarification on MSNBC. Fox News Channel reported on October 17, 2009 that multiple legal analysts stated Limbaugh could file a libel lawsuit in order to prove he did not say the words attributed to him.

Available modules comprise logging functionality, Blowfish encryption, user and channel management, away functionality, a partyline and more. A very popular module is webadmin: it provides a way to manage users and channels conveniently using only a web browser. ZNC also supports ident spoofing via oidentd. ZNC has been in development since July 2004, as an alternative to psyBNC which kept crashing for the ZNC author, and new releases are made regularly. It has received favorable reviews, especially in comparison to psyBNC, and has an active community on IRC. In mid-2009, ZNC's popularity among iPhone users increased after notification modules for Colloquy and Growl were published. Since 2012, IRC clients started to integrate with ZNC: while sending channel buffers to the client, ZNC uses a timestamp indicating when each message was received, and the client shows this instead of the time when the client received the buffer.

Minnesota had a 28-game winning streak when they went to Evanston for a Halloween Day game against Northwestern. The game was scoreless when Widseth tackled a Northwestern player, and the referee accused Widseth of \\"slugging\\" the Northwestern player. After a 15-yard penalty was assessed, the ball was placed at Minnesota's one-yard line, and Northwestern scored a touchdown for the only points of the game.

Geography Streatley is situated just to the west of the A6, and is the first village on the A6 north of Luton, being about north of central Luton. Nearby villages are Lower Sundon, further to the west, Sharpenhoe, 1.5 miles north, and Barton-le-Clay, a somewhat larger village about 1.5 miles north, on the eastern side of the A6. The parish covers the village of Streatley along with Sharpenhoe. In the south of the parish it covers both sides of the A6, bordering Luton to the south and North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire to the east. North of the village of Streatley, the parish is entirely to the west of the A6. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 1,707. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. History The parish is of ancient origin, and has sometimes been known as 'Streatley with Sharpenhoe'. It was expanded in 1928 by taking part of the abolished Limbury parish, which was mostly being annexed to Luton, and then again in 1933 by taking in part of Stopsley parish which suffered a similar fate. Public house Streatley contains only one public house, The Chequers, which serves a variety of beers and ales for all customers who visit the village. Food and accommodation is also available. St Margaret's Church The village is the site of an Anglican church dedicated to St Margaret.

He matriculated at St Andrews university in 1773 and was a Glasgow scholar of Balliol College, Oxford. He married Sarah Wye (1762‚Äì1849) in 1788. The Wye family had for some generations lived in Porto, Portugal where her father John Wye (1737‚Äì1807) worked at the British Factory Chaplaincy. The Wye family had in the past owned Lypiatt Park, near Stroud, Gloucestershire. It is said that James fell in love with Sarah Wye, but the Wye family did not approve and sent her off to her uncle at Beverley in Yorkshire. One night when the family were going out to a ball she pleaded ill health, and stayed at home, and James eloped with her. They went to St Andrews and were married there.\\"The Hadow Family\\", by Arthur Lovell Hadow of Kester, Kesming, Kent printed privately in 1953.

She is one of two surviving Pere Marquette 2-8-4 \\"Berkshire\\" type locomotives. No parts from 1223 were used to restore sister engine No. 1225 to operating condition, due to the objections of the Michigan Railroad Club, then unofficial custodians of the engine. The MSU Railroad Club did hold some successful fundraising events at the 1223 during the State Fair. That money was used in the restoration of the 1225. History Built in 1941 by the Lima Locomotive Works for $90,000 ($1.6 million in 2019 dollars), 1223 hauled freight between Toledo and Chicago in the years immediately before and after World War II. When Pere Marquette was absorbed by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, 1223 was assigned number 2657 but never had the new number applied. The locomotive was not paid off at the time and the merger agreement stated that equipment still under trust was to remain in Pere Marquette livery. 1223 was retired from service in 1951. After retirement, 1223 was moved to New Buffalo, Michigan to be scrapped. However she was repainted and moved in 1960 for display at the state fairgrounds in Detroit. The money for that was provided by the donations collected by school children around the Detroit Area. In 1980, Michigan state fair officials wanted to expand the grandstands but 1223 stood in the way. The city of Grand Haven won the bidding process. With the help of the Michigan National Guard as well as Grand Trunk Western and Chessie System railroads, 1223 was moved to Grand Haven on September 1, 1981. The 1223 was cosmetically restored in 1982. Considering the number of years that it has stood out in the elements, it would be an expensive and time-consuming project to restore it to operation. Such a restoration is unlikely since sister locomotive #1225 has been restored to operating condition. 1223 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2000. Unfortunately on February 28th, 2020 The locomotive was vandalized by vandals.https://www.woodtv.com/news/ottawa- county/historic-train-in-grand-haven-targeted-by- vandals/https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/02/28/locomotive- display-western-michigan-target-vandals/111378618/ References * 1223 2-8-4 locomotives Lima locomotives Individual locomotives of the United States National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Buildings and structures in Ottawa County, Michigan Railway locomotives on the National Register of Historic Places National Register of Historic Places in Ottawa County, Michigan Railway locomotives introduced in 1941 Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Standard gauge locomotives of the United States 1‚Ä≤D2‚Ä≤ h2 locomotives Grand Haven, Michigan ","title":"Pere Marquette 1223"},{"id":"6312651","text":"The Chimborazo The Cordillera Occidental range is one of two main mountain ranges in the Andes in Ecuador, the other being the Cordillera Central.

A year later, Gainsbourg, after the death of her sister Kate Barry, contacted him again and told him that she would like to express certain things and that she could only say them in French. Thus, they started working on Rest in New York. This album, which he produced and composed, was released on 17 November 2017.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 3 October 2005. Suzanne was introduced by series producer David Hanson as part of the Ashworth family. In February 2010, Suzanne was axed from the serial by new series producer Paul Marquess. Suzanne made her final appearance on 14 July 2010. Marquess stated in an interview that he was a big fan of Hall's work in the serial. In late 2010 it was revealed that Hall had returned to filming and Suzanne would be pregnant with twins. Suzanne's storylines have included trying to keep her family together, fathering a son Rhys Ashworth secretly with another man, other affairs and a feud with Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley). Suzanne returned to Hollyoaks on 14 January 2011 for a period of 2 months. In 2012 it was announced that Hall had reprised the role once again. Casting Suzanne was created in 2005 as part of the Ashworth family by David Hanson, actress Suzanne Hall was cast into the role. In early 2010, it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing the entire remaining Ashworth family apart from Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). The move was part of his reinvention of the serial and clearing out the \\"deadwood\\". Marquess later revealed he axed the Ashworths because he believed The Dog should have a lively family at the heart of it, that the Ashworths had become grim because of their hard hitting storyline, but added it was a shame because he is a \\"huge fan of Hall's work on Hollyoaks\\". In December 2010, it was confirmed that Suzanne would return to Hollyoaks in 2011. On 3 December 2012, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy announced that Suzanne would return to Hollyoaks in a guest capacity that month. Character development Suzanne has been described as always trying to hold her family together. In 2007 Hall stated that Suzanne was unhappy adding: \\"I have to look really miserable all the time at the moment. I hope soon she can have some happiness in her life, maybe even have an affair.\\" She also added that Suzanne is \\"downtrodden and bored\\". Suzanne has been seen struggling to cope with daughter Hannah Ashworth's (Emma Rigby) anorexia battle, of the filming Hall states: \\"The anorexia scenes with Hannah were so sad. We were crying for hours at a time and the tears were real. I think moreso for me because I have a daughter who is the same age.\\" In 2011 Suzanne returns and her storyline sees her pregnant with twins. Speaking Suzanne's return Ashley Taylor Dawson who plays Suzanne's old lover Darren Osborne stated: \\"she says, 'It's twins and they're yours'. At first, he doesn't believe her and he thinks it's a wind-up. The dates match up. It's a huge shock. But when she threatens to go back to Spain, he realises it's not what he wants and he stops her. He decides to man up and be a dad to his kids.\\" Storylines After her son Josh and nephew, Fletch (Sam Darbyshire) were involved in a car crash after a joy ride she treated Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and found out she was pregnant. She told Amy to tell one of her parents about the baby, but Amy was reluctant. When Amy started seeing her son Josh she warned her away from him, because she was worried Josh wouldn't be able to handle having to look after someone else's child. It was revealed during a stay of her brother-in-law, Noel Ashworth, that she has had an affair with him, and that in fact, Noel is her eldest son Rhys' father, not her husband, Neville. When the family find this out, they are shocked, and Hannah and Josh start to treat her like a stranger. After returning from a holiday in France, Suzanne began to worry about Hannah and her friendship with Melissa Hurst (Carla Chases) Suzanne thinks that Hannah is under the influence of drugs from Melissa because she doesn't know that Hannah is actually suffering from anorexia nervosa, and bans Melissa from the house. When Hannah accuses Gilly of sexually abusing her, Suzanne believes her at first, but beings to grow suspicious of her story when Gilly tries to explain what really is happening. Suzanne finally realised the truth about Hannah's anorexia when she broke into Hannah's room and found her hidden food, and her food diary. Suzanne felt guilty for not figuring it out quicker and tries to comfort an unwilling Hannah. When Hannah helps Melissa escape from hospital, it all goes wrong and things do not go quite as planned. They plan to run away together, miles from home. But when they go to the Ashworth's to retrieve Hannah's passport, they get caught out by a shocked Josh. Hannah tells Josh not to tell Suzanne, but he called for Suzanne. When he calls Suzanne, she tries to stop them both from running away. Although they nearly got away with it, Melissa suddenly has an unexpected heart attack and collapses on the floor. Suzanne tries to resuscitate Melissa, but she was too late. After Melissa's death, Suzanne was determined to see Hannah recover from her illness. When Hannah faints one day in her room, whilst Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) are having an argument about Craig Dean (Guy Burnett), Suzanne searches Hannah's room to find out where she has been hiding her food. She discovers a pile of rotting food under a floorboard in Hannah's room and feels helpless that she is unable to help her daughter and decides that Hannah must be admitted to hospital to receive professional help to recover from her illness, so she is sectioned. In late May 2009, Suzanne, Neville, Rhys and Josh assumed that Hannah had taken a relapse over her eating disorder. Ash Roy (Junade Khan), who was jealous after Hannah dumped him for Justin Burton (Chris Fountain), planted food in Hannah's room to make it look like she was hiding food and had in fact had a relapse, although he admitted to Hannah he had done it so her family would think Justin is not good for her and is causing the 'relapse'. The Ashworths attempted to stop Hannah seeing Justin. Hannah got Ash to come to her house and admit to Suzanne and Nev that he had put the food in the room, however he told them he never did it and he was worried for Hannah's mental well-being. After Justin left Hollyoaks, Hannah moved out of The Dog and moved in with Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), knowing she could not live with her family who thought she was ill and did not believe her. However things went from bad to worse, when the whole family discovers that Hannah had drunkenly married Darren. Suzanne tries to push Hannah into getting an annulment. However, this pushes her more towards Darren and the pair stay married. Nev and Suzanne's teenage godson Duncan Button (Dean Aspen) comes to stay with her the Ashworths. Hannah relapses and ends up back in hospital. She recovers and later leaves the village on her own with the Ashworths' support. Suzanne is horrified when Josh is involved in a car crash then arrested for drink driving after Rhys spiked his drink. She is angry with her son thinking he should know better even though he protests his innocence. Suzanne and Neville do not believe him. When Josh's life deteriorates, Suzanne begins to support her son although this causes arguments with Neville who has disowned him. Whilst having her birthday dinner, Suzanne is shocked in disbelief that Neville reports Josh to the police, after Josh punches him. Josh is sent to prison for a few weeks for a second drink driving offense. At Calvin (Ricky Whittle) and Carmel Valentine's (Gemma Merna) wedding, Suzanne sleeps with Darren. Suzanne later embarked on an affair with Darren, until Rhys catches them outside Darren's flat. Rhys tells Neville who then kicks Suzanne out of The Dog. She then moved in with Darren, temporarily, alongside Cindy and Holly. Neville forgives Suzanne and they reconcile and move to Spain. Suzanne returns in January and meets Nancy and Darren in the pub. She tells them that Neville is divorcing her because she is pregnant with Darren's twins. A few days later, Suzanne gives birth to twins Jack and Francine during the opening of Tony Hutchinson's (Nick Pickard) spa. Her and the twins then move in with Darren. Suzanne later gets roped into a failed money-making scheme by Darren and Duncan. Cindy Hutchinson (Stephanie Waring) returns and offers Suzanne ¬£100,000 to go back to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne offers to go if she doubles the money, which she does, and Suzanne leaves for Spain, taking Francine and Jack with her leaving Darren heartbroken. Suzanne returns in December 2012 to attend Rhys's funeral and informs Darren that the twins are doing fine and that they are beginning to talk. It is implied that she and Neville are still together in Spain. Suzanne returns to Spain after the funeral.

Location Bentiu is located in Rubkona County, Northern Liech state, in northern South Sudan, near the international border with the Republic of the Sudan. It lies approximately 654 kilometers (406 miles), by road, northwest of Juba, the capital and largest city in the country. Bentiu sits on the southern bank of the Bahr el Ghazal River that separates it from the town of Rubkona, which sits on the river's northern bank. The two towns are joined by the El Salaam Bridge that spans the river. This bridge, along with a market, was bombed and partially damaged by North Sudanese MiG-29 bomber airplanes on April 23, 2012, during the Heglig Crisis.http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501710_162-57418868/sudan-migs-bomb-market- in-south-sudan/ At least three people were killed in the raid.Hereward Holland, \\"Sudan bombs South Sudan border area, kills three: witnesses\\", Reuters, April 23, 2012. Retrieved October 16, 2018. Population , the population of Bentiu was estimated at about 9,700. Overview The town was the administrative, political and commercial center of Unity state before its reorganisation in 2015 into the three new states of Ruweng, Southern Liech, and Northern Liech, the latter of which is its current location. The state governor maintains the headquarters of the state in the town, however the county headquarters for Rubkona County are situated in the town of Rubkona, across the river. During the South Sudanese conflict that began in December 2013, the national government lost control of the town to a commander loyal to former vice president Riek Machar, although Machar denied this. Violence in the area continued, and on January 17, 2014, a United Nations official was quoted as saying that the town ‚Äúsimply did not exist anymore‚Äù, and that ‚Äúit was completely burnt down‚Äù. In April 2014, hundreds of Bentiu civilians were massacred by the ‚ÄúSudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement in Opposition Army‚Äù led by Machar.  United Nations Protection of Civilians Site Bentiu  In December 2014, between 40,000 and 50,000 people lived in Bentiu's refugee/IDP camp, located outside the ransacked town of Bentiu, and Doctors Without Borders had begun to provide medical services.VOA, Calm Amid Fear in Daily Life in S. Sudan‚Äôs Town of Bentiu, December 22, 2014. A 2015 survey indicated that Nuer was the preferred language for radio and news in the camp. By 2016, the camp was considered the largest refugee camp in South Sudan, and over 120,000 people had sought refuge there to escape fighting. Conditions in the camp were especially difficult in the dry season, when temperatures can reach 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional wells were drilled to increase the available water supply, with the assistance of the Groundwater Relief charitable organization. In 2018, a tree nursery pilot project was implemented for the camp, by the International Organization for Migration South Sudan, with support from the USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and the European Commission Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, using \\"local trees such as mango, guava, neem, dinkipesha, ban, keer, meth, lemon, bannes, powpow, dhuras, chokas, etc.\\" In November 2018, Doctors without Borders reported that a series of shocking attacks had occurred, against 125 women and girls who were walking to a food distribution center in Bentiu. On December 20, the Government of South Sudan said \\"claims of sexual attacks on more than 150 women and girls outside Bentiu in Northern Liech State are unfounded and baseless.\\" The United Nations Mission in South Sudan deployed a human rights team to the area to investigate allegations of 150 rapes, added patrols for additional protection, and began clearing brush and vegetation from roadsides to deter attackers. Economy * The former Unity state is the location of some of the largest oil deposits in South Sudan. The Heglig oil field, to the north of Bentiu, straddles the border between Sudan and South Sudan.

Poet, journalist, children's writer and author, Carnie Holdsworth was the first working-class woman in Britain to publish a novel and is a rare example of a female working-class novelist.The Socialist Novel In Britain, ed. by H. Gustav Klaus (Brighton: Harvester, 1982) 0-7108-0340-0 She published at least ten novels during her lifetime. Childhood The British writer Ethel Carnie Holdsworth was born on 1 January 1886 into a weaving family in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. When she was six her parents moved to the growing textile town of Great Harwood, near Blackburn. She started part-time work at Delph Road mill in Great Harwood at aged eleven and was in full-time employment at St. Lawrence mill from thirteen. In her later articles for the Woman Worker, she described her experience as \\"slavery\\". Education Holdsworth attended Great Harwood British School from 1892. According to Edmund and Ruth Frow, she showed promise in composition and often had her essays read out to the rest of the class, but otherwise showed no outstanding ability.Edmund and Ruth Frow, 'Ethel Carnie Holdsworth: Writer, Feminist and Socialist', in The Rise of Socialist Fiction 1880-1940, ed. by H. Gustav Klaus (Brighton: Harvester, 1987), 251-56 She studied at Owens College (University of Manchester) during the 1911/12 academic session and matriculated on 11 January 1912. Early writing Holdsworth started composing poetry while working as a winder at the St. Lawrence mill. Her first book of poems, Rhymes from the Factory, was published in 1907. When this was republished in an enlarged one shilling edition in 1908 she achieved national recognition.Keighley Snowden, 'A Book of the Hour. Factory Lass and Poetess', Woman Worker, 3 July 1908, 135. Robert Blatchford, proprietor of the Clarion, interviewed Ethel Carnie at 76 Windsor Road, Great Harwood, in the summer of 1908 for a feature in one of his newspapers, the Woman Worker. Carnie Holdsworth appeared in the newspaper's 'Portrait Gallery' under the title 'A Lancashire Fairy'.Robert Blatchford, 'A Lancashire Fairy, An Interview with Miss Ethel Carnie', Woman Worker, 10 July 1908, 155. Blatchford offered her a job writing articles and poems for the Woman Worker, in London, which she also edited between July and December 1909. Carnie was dismissed after six months for reasons which remain obscure. Edmund and Ruth Frow suggest that her increasingly political and feminist editorials may have caused Blatchford to reassess her input.Edmund and Ruth Frow, 'Ethel Carnie Holdsworth: Writer, Feminist and Socialist', in The Rise of Socialist Fiction 1880-1940, ed. by H. Gustav Klaus (Brighton: Harvester, 1987), 251-56 A second book of poems, Songs of a Factory Girl, was published in 1911, and her third and final collection of poems, Voices of Womanhood, followed three years later. Holdsworth taught creative writing at Bebel House Women's College and Socialist Education Centre in London in 1913, but returned to Great Harwood before the end of the year. Her first novel, Miss Nobody, was published in the same year. Political activities Holdsworth protested against the introduction of conscription in World War I and chaired local meetings of the British Citizen Party.Roger Smalley, 'The Life and Work of Ethel Carnie Holdsworth, with particular reference to the period 1907 to 1931' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Central Lancashire, 2006) During the 1920s she edited and produced The Clear Light, an anti-fascist journal, with her husband Alfred Holdsworth from their home in Slack Top, Hebden Bridge. In this period she also published a series of sonnets in the anarchist journal Freedom, protesting at the imprisonment of anarchists in Soviet jails. Literary significance Dr Kathleen Bell is one of the leading figures in the campaign to introduce the work of this long-forgotten writer to a new generation. She writes that > \\"at its best, Holdsworth's poetry illuminates the gap between working-class > people's desire for liberty, often evident in their imaginative capacity, > and the constraints and suffering of their lives\\". The children's story \\"The Blind Prince\\" (in The Lamp Girl and other stories, 1913) shows the influence of Oscar Wilde. This Slavery (1925) is Holdsworth's best-known work. Holdsworth wrote poems and short stories until 1936 but there is no record of her writing after this date. Holdsworth's daughter Margaret told an interviewer that her mother stopped writing because she was worn out and depressed about the imminent outbreak of World War II. This Slavery was republished by Trent Editions in November 2011, with a critical introduction by Dr Nicola Wilson. Since 2013, independent publisher Kennedy & Boyd have been bringing Ethel Carnie Holdsworth's writing back into the public domain, with republications of Miss Nobody (1913; 2013), Helen of Four Gates (1917; 2016) and General Belinda (1924; 2019). Personal life Ethel Carnie Holdsworth on her wedding day in 1915. The inset is Alfred Holdsworth Carnie married the poet Alfred Holdsworth in 1915. They had two daughters. She later separated from her husband. From the early 1930s onwards she lived in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. Miscellaneous The composer Ethel Smyth set two of Holdsworth's poems in the song cycle Three Songs (1913). Smyth dedicated \\"Possession\\" to Emmeline Pankhurst and \\"On the Road: a marching tune\\" to Christabel Pankhurst. The latter song was premiered in 1913 at the Queen's Hall, London. The novel Helen of Four Gates (1917) was filmed in 1920.

She was scrapped in 1984. History The ship was named after Thuban, the primary star in the constellation Draco, which was at one time the pole star and important in ancient Egyptian religion. USS Thuban served as a commissioned ship for 21 years and 3 months. Thuban was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 203) on 2 February 1943 at Kearny, N.J., by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.; launched on 26 April 1943; sponsored by Miss Madeleine Carroll; acquired by the Navy on 9 June 1943; and commissioned on 10 June 1943 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Comdr. James C. Campbell, USNR, in command. Aleutian and Gilbert Islands, 1943 On 23 June 1943, Thuban got underway from Gravesend Bay and anchored the next day in Hampton Roads. Following a week of tests and exercises, the new attack cargo ship, escorted by the destroyer , departed Norfolk and steamed southward conducting intensive drills and exercises en route to the Panama Canal Zone. After transiting the Panama Canal on 5 July and 6 July, Thuban continued on independently to the California coast and arrived at San Diego on the 13th. In the days that followed, she conducted landing craft exercises; and, on the 22nd, she arrived at Oakland to load cargo for the assault on Japanese- occupied islands in the Aleutian chain. On 5 August, she commenced exercises at Adak and on the 15th anchored off Quisling Cove, Kiska, to take part in what was expected to be an assault on a Japanese stronghold. However, the landing turned out to be unopposed. Thuban remained in the Aleutians until late in the month while American forces reoccupied the islands. She then steamed south, touched at San Francisco, and arrived at San Diego on 6 September. On the 16th, the ship set her course for the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 22nd. After loading cargo, she departed on 2 October, escorted by the destroyer and bound for the Ellice Islands. On the 8th, the attack cargo ship arrived at Funafuti to discharge her cargo; then continued on to anchor at Wellington Bay, New Zealand, on the 19th. There, she embarked elements of the 2nd Marine Division and participated in exercises in preparation for the coming assault on Tarawa. On 1 November, she got underway and on the 8th arrived at Efate, where, for two days, she conducted landing craft exercises in Meli Bay. On the 13th, she departed the New Hebrides to take part in \\"Operation Galvanic\\" ‚Äì the conquest of the Gilbert Islands. Before dawn on \\"D-Day,\\" 20 November 1943, Thuban arrived at her assigned position in the transport area off Betio Island and began lowering boats and \\"amph-tracs\\" for the initial assault on Tarawa. All of her boats were in the water by 0435, and Thuban prepared to unload cargo. At 0551, as she maneuvered to maintain her station in the transport area, enemy shore batteries found the range of the transports, and a shell landed between Thuban and attack transport . The transports quickly headed out to sea, beyond range of the shore batteries, but not before additional shells landed among them, providing many anxious moments. Nightly air raids on the island, a reported periscope sighting, and bomb explosions on Betio marked the tense days that followed. Thuban continued unloading cargo and supplied fuel and repairs for her own boats and those of other ships. Thuban lost three men to enemy action during this operation, and four of her landing craft were sunk as they moved toward the beach. Shore parties sent her a number of casualties which taxed her limited medical facilities. Discharging cargo on call, Thuban remained off Betio until 27 November, when she departed the Gilberts in company with Task Group (TG) 53.8 and headed for the Hawaiian Islands. After disembarking troops and equipment of the 2nd Marine Division at Hilo and Honolulu, Thuban embarked Army units. Then, operating out of Pearl Harbor, she conducted training exercises in Maalaea Bay, Maui, into the new year to prepare for the conquest of the Marshall Islands. Kwajalein, Saipan, and Leyte, 1944 Attached to the 5th Amphibious Force, she departed Pearl Harbor on 21 January 1944 and arrived off Kwajalein on 31 January. At 0410 on 1 February, she began lowering and dispatching her landing craft, 18 of which took part in the initial landings on the islands of the atoll that day. For four days, she unloaded powder, projectiles, tanks, and other items as her boats supported landings on the islands of the atoll. Then, on the 6th, she began reloading troops and cargo. During \\"Operation Flintlock\\", Thuban's boats were constantly busy; and, because of the nature of the seas and the beaches, the landing craft took a beating, often requiring repairs after only two trips. On the 7th, while receiving fuel from Thuban, destroyer tore a hole in the cargo ship's starboard plating. Thuban effected repairs, put to sea the next day, and headed for Hawaii with destroyer in tow. Off Oahu on the 19th, she transferred the destroyer to a tug and entered Pearl Harbor to discharge equipment, cargo, and troops. The next day, she delivered landing craft to the amphibious training base at Kauai and departed the Hawaiian Islands. She moored at San Diego on the morning of the 29th and, during March and April, participated in extensive training operations off the coast of southern California. On 1 May, she departed San Francisco to rejoin the 5th Amphibious Force, encountered foul weather and mountainous seas during the passage to Hawaii, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 6th. Through the remainder of May, she conducted rehearsals for coming amphibious operations. On the 18th, she loaded cargo and troops of the 4th Marine Division and, on the 29th, got underway with TG 52.15 bound via Eniwetok for the assault on the Marianas. Late on the 14th, she approached Saipan. In the dark predawn on the 15th, exploding star shells lighted the sky on Thuban's port beam. Ships of the screen reported the sinking of a submarine as Thuban steamed around the northern tip of the island and headed south, sighting Saipan for the first time at 0445. Before sunrise, she lay to in the transport area and began lowering her boats. As the first assault waves hit the beach in the faint light of early dawn, Thuban's crew enjoyed a grandstand view of \\"D-day\\" on Saipan, especially of the shoreline south of Charankanoa where her own landing craft were operating. Late that day, as the transports commenced night retirement, a group of seven Japanese dive bombers attacked. One plane dropped a bomb near a destroyer some off Thuban's starboard bow, but an eruption of anti-aircraft fire from Thuban and her sister ships of the transport group drove the attackers away. Numerous alarms sounded during the night, and Thuban helped to repel two additional raids. In the days that followed, Thuban continued to unload her vital cargo to supply the forces on shore, furnished ammunition for light cruiser , and took on casualties from Marine and Army units on the beach, occasionally approaching within less than a mile of the shore. Despite frequent air alerts, the attack cargo ship was soon remaining in the transport area unloading through the night. Toward midnight on the night of 22 June and 23 June, a shell from an enemy battery on Tinian passed low over the number three hatch and burst nearby on the port beam, but Thuban escaped damage. All hands remained at battle stations during the night as Thuban took on casualties, made smoke, and continued unloading. On the 26th, Thuban completed discharging her cargo. During air attacks that night, an enemy plane dropped a stick of bombs from Thuban, and a low-flying Japanese aircraft crashed the superstructure of the cargo ship off Thuban's port beam before plunging into the water. That same night, a surprise Japanese counterattack on shore left large numbers of wounded near Garapan requiring evacuation. Anchored off Susupe Point on the morning of the 27th, Thuban embarked 91 injured men filling sick bay, the main deck, and many quarters areas to overflowing with stretcher cases. The attack cargo ship's crew assisted in bathing, bandaging, and feeding the wounded while the ship's one doctor and his assistants aided the most severely injured. On this hectic day, Thuban also fueled, watered, and provisioned various ships. That evening, as the ship made smoke during a prolonged period of air raids, phosphorescent bombs hit the beach near Susupe Point, and a bomb narrowly missed one of her landing craft in the process of transporting a load of wounded. Action continued after midnight as five bombs hit the beach from the ship's position. Departing Saipan on the 28th, Thuban arrived at Eniwetok on 1 July and transferred her patients to ships better equipped to care for them. After fueling and loading ammunition urgently needed by American warships supporting the assault on the Marianas, Thuban departed the Marshalls on the 15th. Returning to Saipan on the 19th, she provided fuel, water, and ammunition to ships of the Marianas invasion force, took on empty brass, and repaired landing craft. Early on the morning of the 24th, seven of her tank lighters took part in the initial landings on Tinian. On the 28th, Thuban got underway and steamed in convoy via Eniwetok to the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 10 August. There, following amphibious exercises off Maui, she embarked Army troops; rendezvoused with TG 33.3; and headed via the Marshalls for the Admiralty Islands, arriving at Manus on 3 October. Assigned to Task Group 79.3 for the impending amphibious assault on Leyte, she departed Seeadler Harbor on 14 October in company with Transport Division 7 and rendezvoused with Attack Group Able. In the early hours of \\"A-day,\\" 20 October, the formation fought the strong currents of the Surigao Strait and drove off a Japanese dive bomber before arriving in the outer transport area. While the battleships delivered a pre-assault bombardment, Thuban began lowering her boats. Throughout the morning, she unloaded cargo; and her landing craft joined the assault waves which raced to the beach. Although interrupted by calls to general quarters and the necessity to make smoke when an air attack was imminent, for three days she discharged a steady stream of vital ammunition, engineering equipment, trucks, trailers, and rations for the troops on shore. On the morning of the 21st, two enemy planes came in low, evading detection, and dropped bombs near the attack transport , astern of Thuban. On the 23rd, she unloaded the last of her cargo; departed the Philippines; and steamed via Manus to arrive at Oro Bay, New Guinea, on 4 November. After loading personnel and equipment of the 11th Airborne Division, she departed New Guinea on the 11th and returned to Leyte Gulf a week later. Through the 22nd, she unloaded her cargo despite 37 calls to general quarters. During this period, a number of aerial dogfights occurred in her area and, although Thuban was not attacked directly, she helped to repel enemy raiders on four occasions. Her mission completed, she departed the Philippines on the 24th and anchored in Humboldt Bay on the 29th. On 13 December, she continued on to Aitape Roads, Tamara Island. During the next two weeks, hampered by rolling treacherous surf and 10- to swells, she loaded cargo and equipment of the Army's 43rd Division Artillery. Thuban then joined Transport Division 7 during rehearsals for the impending Lingayen Gulf landings, embarked troops of the 43rd Artillery, and on 29 December 1944 departed New Guinea with Task Group 78.1, bound for the Philippines. Lingayen and Iwo Jima, 1945 The passage was marked by the sighting of an enemy aerial snooper and the sinking of a Japanese midget submarine by destroyer south of Apo Island. Early on 9 January 1945, the attack cargo ship entered Lingayen Gulf. No enemy opposed her approach; and, by 0900, her landing craft were in the water, and Thuban had begun to discharge her cargo. During a twilight air alert that day, enemy attackers dropped bombs nearby, and Thuban fired on a Japanese fighter plane. During the predawn darkness on 10 January, enemy torpedo boat attacks in the area prompted Thuban to establish a boat patrol to defend the ship against surprise attack. As Thuban made smoke during the ensuing morning twilight, a low flying Japanese plane made a strafing run on the ship. Despite its advantage of surprise, the raider made no hits but escaped before Thuban could open fire. As the ship unloaded the last of her cargo on the night of 11 January and 12 January, a Japanese plane splashed away off her starboard beam; and, as dawn approached, she narrowly avoided damage when two bombs fell only off her port quarter. Later in the day, she got underway and set a course southward. As Thuban steamed toward Leyte Gulf on the morning of the 13th, a Japanese suicide plane attempted to glide-dive into the attack cargo ship. Despite heavy fire from Thuban, the kamikaze pressed the attack until the last possible moment, then banked to port and dove, crashing the bridge of the attack transport , away from Thuban. Thuban anchored in Leyte Gulf on the 15th but got underway three days later, bound for the Schoutens, and arrived at Biak Island on the 22nd. After loading elements of the Army's 41st Division, she departed New Guinea on 2 February, paused briefly in Leyte Gulf, and arrived off Mindoro Island on the morning of the 9th. There she lowered her boats and began unloading which continued through the night as Allied mop-up operations on Mindoro reached completion. Underway on the 10th, she proceeded via Leyte and Ulithi to the Volcanos. Arriving at a point southeast of Iwo Jima in company with TG 12.6 on 9 March, she remained there until the morning of the 17th when she proceeded to the hard-won island and embarked tired, battered, but victorious Marine units. She weighed anchor on the 27th and reached Saipan on the 29th, where she loaded cargo of the 5th Marine Division Air Transport Group. She departed the Marianas on 14 April and steamed to the Hawaiian Islands where she discharged her cargo before continuing on to moor in San Francisco Bay on the 27th. Following repairs, she loaded fleet issue stores at the Oakland Naval Supply depot and departed San Francisco Bay on 19 July 1945. She stopped at Ulithi on 4 August, rendezvoused with elements of Service Squadron 6 on the 8th, and throughout that month provisioned ships of the 3rd Fleet off the coast of Honsh≈´ as they awaited the occupation of Japan. After the formal surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay, she continued to supply American ships, visiting anchorages on the Korean and China coasts into the new year. Pacific, 1946-1950 Transferred to the Naval Transportation Service early in 1946, she operated between the west coast of the United States and various Pacific island groups, including the Marianas and Japan, participating in occupation duties until the outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950. Korea, 1950 After taking on Army cargo at Oakland, she departed the west coast early in August 1950 and arrived at Yokohama on the 29th to discharge her cargo and complete outfitting for her return to the role of attack cargo ship. After combat loading and embarking Army and Navy personnel, Thuban proceeded to Kobe and, on 11 September 1950, got underway with TG 90.2 bound for Operation \\"Chromite\\" ‚Äì the assault on Inchon. En route to its destination, the task group encountered heavy seas as it skirted a typhoon; and Thuban was forced to fall behind to repair a hydraulic line carried away by rough seas. Repairs completed, Thuban rejoined the task group and, on the 15th, approached the outer transport area at Inchon. That day, her boats joined in the first assault waves; and, in the days that followed, the veteran attack cargo ship discharged personnel, cargo, and equipment in support of the invasion. On the 20th, she departed Inchon to return to Yokohama. There, she loaded units of the 7th Division and on 29 September returned to Inchon. Early in October, she took on stores and troops at Yokosuka; then proceeded to Pusan for final staging for the scheduled Riwon landings. Underway on the 28th, she arrived at Iwon Ko on the following day. On the completion of her mission in this landing, she departed Riwon Ko on 6 November. Later that month, she carried elements of the Army's 3rd Division from Japan to Wonsan; then returned to Yokohama on the 21st. On the 23rd, she sailed for home and arrived at San Francisco on 7 December. Atlantic, Caribbean, Mediterranean, 1952-1967 Early in 1952, she returned to the east coast and took up her duties supplying the American Fleet in Atlantic and Caribbean waters. Throughout the 1950s, she continued the familiar round of east coast and Caribbean ports, varied by a voyage to Japan in 1953 and by participation in various fleet exercises in the Atlantic. While deployed in the Mediterranean in the fall of 1956, Thuban took part in extensive exercises. Increasing tension in the Middle East exploded into war on 30 October, and Thuban was called upon to evacuate American nationals from Egypt early in November. She embarked 1,500 evacuees at Alexandria and, on 5 November, departed that troubled port. After transferring her passengers at Suda Bay, she returned to exercises with the 6th Fleet. She participated in NATO exercises in the Mediterranean in 1957 and in November returned to the east coast and routine peacetime operations. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, she operated for two months in Caribbean waters supporting the American naval quarantine. Decommissioning, 1967-1979 Decommissioned in October 1967, Thuban was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and was berthed at Norfolk. On 1 January 1969, she was reclassified an amphibious cargo ship and redesignated LKA-19. She remained in the National Defense Reserve Fleet into October 1979. Thuban received seven battle stars for World War II service and three for Korean War action.

A. R. Newlands was born and raised, in West Square. The blue plaque on the house where Newlands was born and raised in West Square, installed by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The Imperial War Museum, next to West Square. West Square is a historic square in south London, England, just south from St George's Road. The square is within the London Borough of Southwark, but as it is located in postcode SE11, it is commonly said to be in Lambeth. Location Immediately to the west is the Imperial War Museum (formerly the Bethlem Royal Hospital). To the south is the Imperial War Museum Annex (which used to be an orphans' home) in Austral Street. The terraced houses in the square surround a communal garden that is open to the public during the day but locked at night. The square forms part of a larger conservation area. History West Square has the following entry in Volume XXV of the Survey of London, published in 1955 by the then London County Council. In the 1800s, the square was used to house some staff at the Bethlehem Royal Hospital (now the Imperial War Museum). In addition, there were Steward's Quarters in the north-east corner of the Hospital grounds. King Edward's Schools (closed and demolished in the 1930s) occupied the eastern side, together with an area of drying posts. The whole eastern side of the old Hospital grounds is now given over to sports facilities. J. A. R. Newlands (1837‚Äì1898), the Victorian chemist who discovered the Periodic Law for the chemical elements, was born and raised in No. 19. A blue plaque, installed by the Royal Society of Chemistry, commemorates Newlands on the front of the house. In 1884‚Äì5, the Charlotte Sharman School was built on the north-west side, named after its founder, a Christian philanthropist. Construction of the school ‚Äî which is still located there ‚Äî required the demolition of some thirty houses.Charlotte Sharman Primary School, UK. Part of the site is now occupied by the Siobhan Davies Dance Centre As a young child, Charlie Chaplin (1889‚Äì1977) lived at 39 West Square for a short period. He later recalled:Charlie Chaplin, Vauxhall and Kennington, UK. At the end of the 19th century, the garden in the square was threatened with building development, but there was a campaign to keep it. In 1909, the freehold was bought for some ¬£4000 by the London County Council and the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. They enlarged and restored the garden, which was then opened for public use in 1910. The square was scheduled to protect it under the 1931 London Squares Preservation Act. However, after the Second World War, it was proposed that the buildings should be demolished and the area added to Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park. This was blocked by the Civic Amenities Act and instead the square became a conservation area. The terrace of five houses in the north- west corner of the square were demolished c1970, and replaced by modern town houses designed to blend in with the original Georgian architecture (the corner house had at one point been converted into a pub, The City Arms). The west side of the square was also much-altered, with pairs of houses being run together to create four lateral flats in each property. In 1997‚Äì8, and with the exception of numbers 10 and 11, the terrace was reconverted to single houses. Overall, the square remains largely intact and of historic interest, a fact reflected in the 1972 Grade II listing of the east, south and wide sides.
