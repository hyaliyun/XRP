Robert T. Carter's (2007) theory of race-based traumatic stress implies that there are individuals of color who experience racially charged discrimination as traumatic, and often generate responses similar to post-traumatic stress. Race-based traumatic stress combines theories of stress, trauma and race-based discrimination to describe a particular response to negative racial encounters. Despite the limited research that examines race-based traumatic stress specifically, trauma research suggests that an individual's response to a stressor is highly dependent on that person's perception of the stressor; what one person may experience as traumatic, another person may not experience as such. These differing responses have been found to be strongly associated with each individual's ability to cope with the said stressor. According to Carter, a professor at Columbia University, race-based traumatic stress is an individual's response to racial discrimination as traumatic or outside of their ability to cope. Race-based traumatic stress can be experienced both directly and indirectly and can occur on an interpersonal level, institutional level, or cultural level. As such, research indicates that race-based traumatic stress can be demonstrated as a number of negative outcomes, including psychopathological symptoms, social inequities, and internalized racial oppression. Research has indicated that children, as well as adults, can experience and be impacted by the reaches of race-based traumatic stress. Through direct experience from peers and/or authority figures, as well as indirectly through media exposure and/or bearing witness to the racial discrimination of their parents, research suggests children of color are particularly vulnerable to race-based traumatic stress.  Effects  Despite the popular understanding that race is a socially-based construct, research indicates that it has critical social implications and plays a role in the way individuals navigate society. Race-based traumatic stress is viewed as a consequence of racially motivated discrimination, exclusion, and unjust treatment. Racial discrimination can be interpersonal, institutional/structural, and/or cultural. At the interpersonal level, race- based traumatic stress occurs when an individual directly experiences race- based prejudice from another person. Institutional racial discrimination occurs at the hands of trusted or imperative social structures of power in society that for example, may withhold services or resources from people of color. Lastly, on a cultural level, racial discrimination occurs when non- Eurocentric cultures are devalued or viewed as inferior. Additionally, research indicates that racial discrimination can be experienced both overtly and covertly. On an overt level, people of color are targeted in an intentionally blatant manner due to their racial identities. In contrast, covert racial discrimination, often termed microaggressions, often come in the form of subtle messages, whether intentional or not, and demonstrate malicious, invalidating, or disparaging meaning for people of color. With the frequency at which race-based discrimination is found to occur, on both overt and covert levels, some individuals may experience re-traumatization.  Models  The Race-Based Traumatic Stress Model (RBTSM) is a model which outlines the different emotional responses individuals have following race- based encounters. Despite being linked to a variety of outcomes including psychopathology, Carter (2007) believes this response is more of an emotional injury than a pathological one. The model emphasizes Carter's distinction between two forms of racism: discrimination and harassment. It follows that discrimination-based racism is linked to hyperarousal and hypervigilance while consequences of harassment-based racism, such as complex emotional reactions, tend to have a long-lasting impact.  Outcomes  Research indicates that different forms of racial discrimination, such as interpersonal, institutional, and cultural are often associated with specific types of outcomes in people of color. Interpersonal racial discrimination, for example, has been found to have more of an effect at the individual level, often demonstrated in mental health symptoms such as trauma, anxiety, depression, stress, and even physiological symptoms such as hypertension. Racial discrimination at the institutional level has been found to result in social inequities for people of color such as higher rates of incarceration, health disparities, and educational difficulties. Cultural racial discrimination has been found to be associated with internalized racism, often resulting in individuals devaluing their own culture in ways such as denouncing their cultural heritage and values and/or internalizing negative stereotypical beliefs associated with their own racial group. Additionally, research indicates that the internalization of racial oppression can lead to feelings of shame and malice. However, the experience of racial discrimination is complex and its various forms often overlap and lead to a number of psychological, social, and physiological outcomes.  Children  Children are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of race-based traumatic stress, as research indicates that oftentimes they lack the coping strategies needed to overcome these experiences. Research indicates that children can be affected by these stressors both indirectly and directly, through experiences with racially charged interactions or through intergenerational transmission. Racial victimization can result in cross-generational trauma; where children can witness their caregivers either experience race-based discrimination or children can experience the effects of the race-based discrimination for their caregivers. Caregiver's experience of race-based traumatic stress can be displayed in actions such as increased substance use, an increase in delinquency or violence which can lead to incarceration, and mental health difficulties which can impair attachment and parenting strategies. Research suggests that the stressors associated with racial discrimination are chronic and impact multiple areas of development for children such as cognitive, biological and psychosocial. Research implies that children can experience race-based stressors in the form of bullying through verbal comments about their racial identity, physically in the form of violence, or interpersonally, through acts against them such as being excluded from activities. Children can experience verbal attacks that can include teasing concerning distinct aspects of their identity such as physical appearance, beliefs, cultural aspects, accents, language barriers, and acculturation levels. In addition to experiences with peers, children can be targeted by negative interactions with authority figures such as teachers or school staff questioning their capabilities or making verbalizations discouraging their goals.  Outcomes  Given that children have limited coping strategies and cognitive resources to deal with race-based discrimination, research suggests that these experiences can be internalized as traumatic and associated with the development of mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, it is indicated that discrimination experienced in childhood may lead to low self-esteem, difficulties with academic performance, and increased externalizing behaviors such as acting out, defiance, anger, mistrust, and internalizing behaviors such as depression or anxiety. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that children who experience race-based discrimination from peers have increased difficulty with establishing a confident personality, as social interactions and social categories affect their self-esteem and overall self-view. Peer interactions and establishing a social self is an aspect of development that is significant during childhood, therefore experiences with peers can have a significant impact. Getting negative verbalization from either peers or authority figures can lead to internalization of the stereotypes and beliefs about their own race and can lead to difficulties with accepting oneself and adopting beliefs that they are not capable of accomplishing goals. Research suggests that these experiences can impact their self-esteem and overall worldview.  Assessment  The lack of research on race-based traumatic stress is in part due to the fact that it is difficult to recognize or assess because there is no clear link associated with experiencing racial discrimination and the development of psychological difficulties in response to the racial encounter. Currently, no diagnoses account for trauma associated with race-based interactions and experiences, and limited assessments accurately assess for experiences of racial discrimination. The Race-Based Traumatic Stress Symptom Scale (RBTSSS) is an assessment that has been developed in order to address this lack of appropriate assessments. The RBTSSS utilizes open-ended questions related to 3 experiences of racism that each individual has encountered. Individuals are then prompted to identify whether the experience was emotionally painful, sudden, and not in their control. Individuals choose one of these experiences and address questions related to feelings after the event, which fall within the following subscales; Anger, Depression, Intrusion, Hypervigilance, Physical, Low self-esteem, Avoidance. Use of tools such as the RBTSSS is recommended in order to address distress associated with race-based traumatic stress.  Treatment  The little research on race-based traumatic stress suggests that treatment can focus on the symptoms associated with the experiences such as hyperarousal, low self-esteem, hyper vigilance, substance use, and engagement in risky-behavior. Furthermore, highlighting protective factors, such as support from friends and family, positive outlook, and engagement in extracurricular activities can increase feelings of being included in the community. Research suggests that future goals for improved treatment of race-based traumatic stress can include specialized training for mental health professionals to increase the professional's capabilities of having discussions about race and discrimination and exploring the impact on each individual's life. Furthermore, research indicates that in addition to addressing the common symptoms associated with mental health disorders, clinicians can focus on exploring and addressing the direct impact of race- based traumatic stress.

The mall is owned by Rural King Realty. History Chahanie Development announced the shopping center in 1967 and began construction in 1969. The first announced tenants were J. C. Penney, G. C. Murphy variety store, Arlan's discount store, Walgreens, an IGA supermarket, and Kinney Shoes. Official opening ceremonies were held in October 1971, by which point many stores were already open. Both IGA and a branch of the Springfield, Illinois-based department store Myers Brothers opened on October 27. Sears joined the mall in 1972. After Arlan's declared bankruptcy in 1973, their store closed and was converted to Kmart the following year. According to mall developers, this made Cross County Mall the first shopping center in the nation to include J. C. Penney, Sears, and Kmart, then the nation's three largest retailers. G. C. Murphy closed in 1976 and work began that year to convert the space to Meis, a department store based out of Terre Haute, Indiana. The Meis store opened in 1978. The same year, Bergner's purchased the Myers Brothers chain and converted all stores to the Bergner's name. By 1981, the IGA space on the southeast end of the mall had been vacated, and it was converted into a new mall hallway. This venture proved unsuccessful and by 1988, the mall owners had attempted to turn the space into a food court. At the time, the only food options in the mall were a sandwich shop and a restaurant located inside Kmart, as Walgreens had removed its in-store diner around the same time. The food court was unable to attract restaurants, so the space was converted to an antique mall in 1990. Meis was bought out by Elder-Beerman in mid-1989. Bergner's closed at the mall after the Christmas 1989 shopping season, due to the space being too small for a full-line department store. Maurices and other stores repurposed the former Bergner's space. Kmart moved to a larger store outside the mall in 1993; one year later, Sears moved from its existing location to the former Kmart. Soon afterward, the original Sears building became Wolf Furniture. The space was later a medical training center, and became the offices for the city's newspaper. Walgreens moved out of the mall in 2003. In 2011, Elder-Beerman was rebranded as Carson's.In September 2011 Borders Group bookstore closed. Sears closed at the mall in late 2014. Major tenants in the mall as of 2014 included Jo-Ann Fabrics, Bath & Body Works, Maurices, Christopher & Banks, Claire's, rue21, GNC and Shoe Dept.On March 26, 2016, RadioShack closed its doors. In 2017, the farming supply retail chain Rural King acquired the mall and announced plans to move a store support center into the former Sears. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that Carson's would be closing on August 31, 2018 as parent company The Bon-Ton Stores went out of business. This left J. C. Penney as the only anchor until January 16, 2019 when Rural King opened in the former Sears. On July 2, 2018 a new 11 for $10 store opened in the former Hallmark space in the mall and would later close less than a year after being open, closing in June 2019. On July 12, 2018 Rural King announced they would move their Mattoon store into the former Sears location which opened on January 16, 2019. On August 31, 2018 Super Jumbo Buffet Chinese restaurant closed and was replaced by Scotty's Brewhouse which opened December 10, 2018.This space was briefly tenanted by Scotty‚Äôs Brewhouse for almost one year before its doors closed in late 2019. McQuarter's Pub now occupies the space. In the spring of 2019 Payless ShoeSource closed as the company announced it would close all of its locations. Marshalls moved in to the mall and opened November 24, 2019. On March 18th of 2020 Glik's returned to the mall and opened in the former 11 for $10 store location.

History Hans Just The company was founded by Hans Just on 17 June 1867, when he purchased a wine and spirits business on Store Kongensgade street, in Copenhagen, Denmark, from an old friend who wanted to emigrate to America. In the 1870s, Just constructed a summer residence near the coast in √òsterbro. In 1882, together with other investors, he established a distillery, Fortuna, on the neighbouring site. In 1885 they constructed a new road which connected the site to √òsterbrogade. It was given the name Fortunavej (Fortuna Road( after the distillery and was later renamed √Örhusgade. Poul Just's mansion at √òster All√© in Copenhagen Hans Just's son Poul Just inherited the company after his father's death in 1812. He demolished the √òsterbro buildings and constructed a large warehouse at the site in 1917. The site was conveniently located close to the Freeport of Copenhagen, and he expected Denmark to introduce an alcohol monopoly similar to the ones in Sweden and Norway. This did not happen, and much of the building was instead rented out. It was for a while used by Goodyear for storing car tires. The company was later passed on to his son Henning Just (norn 1905) and son-in-law Peter Christian Karberg (born 1909M married to Kirsten Ingeborg Just). Their son, Flemming Just Karberg, joined the family business at the age of 22 in 1859. He became co-owner in 1965 and its sole owner in 1879. His sons Peter, Thomas and Andreas each received 10 % of the shares in the 1980s. In 2017, Hans Just Group sold its share of Det Danske Spiritus Kompagni A/S to the Norwegian company Arcus Gruppen.

Minta gained custody of the dog as part of the couple's separation agreement and divorce settlement, although Roscoe did have visitation rights to see him. That arrangement may explain why the veteran stunt dog did not appear again on screen after his work with Keaton in The Scarecrow in 1920. A tragic scandal that rocked Arbuckle's personal and professional life in 1921 may have also affected Luke's career and be another reason for the dog's apparent retirement from performing.

History Pi Epsilon Delta was established at the University of Wisconsin on June 8, 1919. The first group contained 17 men and women including 4 faculty members. Key people included the first president Ray E. Holcolm, first vice president Lawrence W. Murphy and Frances Allen Tucker who designed the key which was the emblem of the organization. It was established as a purely honorary group. By 1922, additional chapters were present at Washington University of St. Louis, University of Minnesota and Northwestern University. In that year, Pi Epsilon Delta merged with Associated University Players to form National Collegiate Players . The ideals and scope of the new National Collegiate Players were identical to those of Pi Epsilon Delta. Associated University Players had been founded in 1913 at University of Illinois and had chapters at Ohio University, University of Washington and University of Oregon. All but University of Washington voted to join the merged organization. The name National Collegiate Players had been adopted due to resistance to greek letter organizations, being viewed as yet another secret order. The Key and Motto of Pi Epsilon Delta were maintained in the new organization. Jewelry and Symbols The Pi Epsilon Delta pin contained the two masks of drama and the letters Pi Epsilon Delta.

Granniss; July 11, 1824 ‚Äì March 21, 1904) was an American writer, activist, hymn writer, evangelist and missionary. She was Texas' first ordained woman Universalist minister. Billings, an ordained minister in the Universalist Church, did missionary work in Texas, and associated with her husband, of the same congregation, who was superintendent of its missions in the State. Though Billings largely gave her life to clerical work, she displayed great activity in other fields. She wrote two books, one a work of fiction, entitled Emma Clermert, and the other a holiday publication, known as The Wonderful Christmas Tree. Both were well received and were flatteringly commended by the press. While abroad, she wrote \\"Thitherside Sketches,\\" which were serially published in Ladies' Repository, a Boston monthly, running through two years of that publication. Billings was also a prolific writer for northern journals and periodicals, denominational and secular. These productions were both in prose and verse, and from each, certain works were compiled in book form for literary readers. Among these compilations may be mentioned \\"Poets and Poetry of Printerdom,\\" \\"Women in Sacred Song,\\" and \\"Our Women Workers\\". Billings was a member of The Texas Woman's Press Association, and of The Woman's State Council. Widowed three times, Billings had no children. Early years and education Mary Charlotte Ward was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, July 11, 1824. Her father was William Ward. William's grandfather, Rev. Solomon Palmer, a Presbyterian minister, was educated at Old Yale. Billings was not systematically educated. For the older children of the family, her parents were anxious that they should receive the best education, and encouraged them to work hard, until the health of several failed, and they died. With Billings, they took the other extreme; and she was allowed plenty of books, but freedom from all schoolroom restraints, and time to exercise in the open air. Her first published poem was written at the age of 12. Career Mary Granniss Emma Clermont In 1845, Billings married Frederick Granniss, also of Litchfield, who was a wealthy silk merchant. They moved to Hartford, Connecticut, and joined the Hartford Universalist congregation. The years 1859‚Äì60, she traveled abroad with him, and put the result of her experiences and observations into a series of letters called \\"Thither-Side Sketches\\" for Ladies' Repository. After returning from their foreign trip, they built a suburban home, known as \\"Lilfred's Rest.\\" Here, for several years, she led a happy, quiet, intellectual life, reading what she enjoyed, and writing when the spirit moved her. Her first book, Emma Clermont was published in 1849. The poor health of Frederick precipitated a move to Turpentine Camp in the pine forests of Alabama with the hope for an improvement in Frederick's health. Her letters from the forest of Alabama were instructive and entertaining. \\"Bear Ye One Another's Burdens\\" was a touching poem, containing a whole sermon. They eventually returned to Hartford where Frederick died in 1866. Mary Webster In 1869, the widow married the Universalist minister and publisher, Rev. Charles Henry Webster. She assisted her husband in his pulpit ministry as a lay preacher while Charles was performing missionary work. Though never ordained, she often back-filled for absent ministers. During this time, she was interested in every project for the welfare of women, including serving as Vice President of the Woman's Centenary Association for seven years, as well as writing prose and verse for the denominational periodical press. In 1877, Charles died. Rev. Mary Billings In 1885, in Waco, Texas, she married Rev. James Billings, another Universalist minister and publisher. They settled in Hico, Texas where she was licensed in 1886 and ordained as a Universalist minister on October 3, 1892. She was widowed again in 1898. Billings died March 21, 1904, in Hico, and is buried at Hico Cemetery. Selected works The Wonderful Christmas Tree ;As Mrs. M. C. Granniss * Emma Clermont; or, Life's changes.

Its first election contest was in the 2017 Bennelong by-election. The party's registration was announced to the public as an exclusive by News.com.au journalist Benedict Brook on 24 August 2017. The party's leader and lead Senate candidate for NSW is Andrew Potts, a former newspaper editor and opinion columnist and the executive and associate producer of two Australian feature films, The Dream Children (2015) and Mongolian Bling (2012). The party's president and second announced Senate candidate for NSW is Anthony Ziebell, a tenants rights activist and owner of the website DontRentMe.com - a service which allows renters to review bad landlords and property managers. Ziebell has appeared on several episodes of Channel 9's A Current Affair program and has been interviewed by a large range of other media. After the High Court ruled that the Nationals MP and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was ineligible to have been elected to the Australian Parliament, the New England byelection was called. The party announced that Potts would stand for the seat. He secured the number three spot on the ballot paper for the election in which seventeen candidates were running, outpolling six other candidates and finishing just 23 votes behind the Sustainable Australia candidate. The party announced on 16 November that Ziebell would contest the Bennelong byelection after sitting member John Alexander resigned his seat, fearing that the High Court might also find him ineligible. Twelve candidates contested the election and Ziebell outpolled four of those candidates. Registration It was registered with effect from 24 January 2017. The party had been refused registration by a delegate of the Electoral Commission, but this was overturned by the full Commission on 9 August 2017. The issue of concern had been whether the party had been able to satisfy the Electoral Commission that it had at least 500 electors in its membership. This was achieved following random sampling of the membership list submitted during March and April 2017.

The episode was written by showrunners Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, from a story by series co-creator Bryan Fuller, and was directed by Adam Kane. Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Michael Burnham, the First Officer of the . Series regular Doug Jones also appears in the episode, which serves as the second in the series' two-part premiere that act as a prologue to the rest of the series, setting up a season-long story arc for Burnham. Guest starring for the two-part premiere are Michelle Yeoh as Philippa Georgiou, captain of the Shenzhou, and Chris Obi as the Klingon leader T'Kuvma. \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\" was released on CBS All Access on September 24, 2017, along with the previous episode. The two-part premiere was believed to have caused record subscriptions for All Access, and received mostly positive reviews from critics, particularly for Martin-Green's performance. Plot After being raised as a Vulcan by Sarek, and becoming the first human to attend and graduate the Vulcan Learning Center and the Vulcan Science Academy, Michael Burnham is entrusted to Philippa Georgiou, captain of the , by Sarek. Seven years later, Burnham is the first officer of the Shenzhou, and has just disobeyed and attacked Georgiou in an attempt to fire, unprovoked, on a Klingon vessel, hoping to avoid an inevitable war. The Klingon outcast Voq, on behalf of his leader T'Kuvma, has just started a beacon that attracts 24 new Klingon vessels to the system, as Georgiou has Burnham imprisoned for mutiny. The leaders of the 24 great houses question T'Kuvma's use of the beacon, which was prophesied to be used to unite the Klingon Empire once again. T'Kuvma is of a disgraced house, and the House of Kor leader Kol refuses to listen to him, especially given his acceptance of outcasts like Voq. T'Kuvma pleads with the other leaders to join him in fighting the United Federation of Planets, who he says intends to destroy their species' individuality. He predicts that reinforcements for the Shenzhou will soon arrive, and that they will announce that they \\"come in peace\\", and when these come to pass, the other leaders agree to fight. The Starfleet ships take heavy fire, and the Shenzhou is almost destroyed, but is saved by the arrival of Admiral Brett Anderson and the USS Europa. T'Kuvma agrees to a ceasefire with Anderson, but then sends a large vessel, hidden with a cloaking device, to ram and destroy the Europa. The latter self-destructs, taking the large vessel with it. T'Kuvma proclaims himself Kahless, the ancient uniter, reborn, and allows the rest of Starfleet to escape as messengers of this. He sends the other Klingon leaders back to Qo'nos while he tends to their dead. In the damaged Shenzhou, Burnham escapes the brig after telepathic encouragement from Sarek, and convinces Georgiou to take T'Kuvma hostage. Using an explosive sent to T'Kuvma's ship with a Klingon corpse as a distraction, Burnham and Georgiou board the ship and attack. Burnham fights off Voq, but Georgiou is killed by T'Kuvma. Burnham fatally shoots T'Kuvma, before being transported back to the Shenzhou. Voq promises the dying T'Kuvma that he will be remembered. Burnham is later court-martialed and sentenced to life in prison by Starfleet for her mutiny. Production Development On November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, \\"on the heels\\" of the original series' 50th anniversary in 2016. In February 2016, Bryan Fuller was announced as the new series' showrunner, but was asked by CBS to step down at the end of October. Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts replaced him as showrunners. In June 2017, CBS announced that the series would now premiere on September 24, and on September 18, revealed that the second episode would be titled \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\". Writing The teleplay for the episode was written by Berg and Harberts, based on a story by Fuller. The episode serves as the second of the season's two-part prologue, exploring protagonist Michael Burnham's initial actions on board the and her relationship with Captain Philippa Georgiou. The writers structured the season this way to avoid having to reveal this information in flashbacks during later events. It was always intended for Georgiou to die in the episode due to Burnham's actions, to set up the latter's story arc for the season in which she must contemplate and come to understand the consequences of her actions. Martin-Green described Georgiou's death as \\"the epitome of devastation. She‚Äôs not just my captain. She‚Äôs not just my mentor. She‚Äôs not just my teacher or my leader‚Äîshe‚Äôs also my mother, in a sense. That‚Äôs one of those turning points. That‚Äôs one of those catastrophic events, one of those mortifying events, that changes the course of your life\\". Casting The series stars Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham, Doug Jones as Saru, Shazad Latif as Ash Tyler, Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets, Mary Wiseman as Sylvia Tilly, and Jason Isaacs as Gabriel Lorca; only Martin-Green and Jones appear in this episode. In November 2016, series' writer and consulting producer Nicholas Meyer mentioned that Michelle Yeoh had been cast in Discovery, and she was soon confirmed to be portraying Captain Georgiou of the USS Shenzhou. Three actors were cast as Klingons in December 2016: Latif as Kol, before he was recast to the role of Tyler; Chris Obi as T'Kuvma; and Mary Chieffo as L'Rell. Obi compared T'Kuvma to Moses, and said that the character was the \\"runt of the litter\\" who was transformed into a leader after believing that he had been tasked by the spirit of Kahless to unite the Klingon Empire. By January 2017, James Frain was cast as original series character Sarek, and the next month, several actors were cast as Starfleet officers, including Terry Serpico as Admiral Anderson and Sam Vartholomeos as Ensign Connor. Release \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\" was made available on CBS All Access on September 24, 2017. In Canada, it was broadcast on the specialty channels Space (English) and Z (French), also on September 24, before being streamed on CraveTV. In 188 other countries, the episode was released on Netflix within 24 hours of its U.S. debut. Marketing The CBS broadcast of the series' first episode featured advertisements from several technology companies, including Apple, Amazon, IBM, Motorola, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Samsung, with CBS charging a premium amount for advertisements during the \\"event\\". Several of the commercials focused on encouraging viewers to subscribe to All Access to see the next episode, and the rest of the series. These commercials focused on the different technologies through which All Access is available, such as Apple, Amazon or Roku. The first episode also ends with a cliffhanger, which CBS hoped would make viewers want to immediately start streaming this episode. Reception Ratings and viewership The episode's release on All Access lead to record subscriptions for All Access, with the service's biggest day, week, and month of signups coming with the premiere. In Canada, the Space release of the episode was watched by 1.2 million viewers. By September 26, the episode was also the 19th most pirated video listed on The Pirate Bay. Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 85% approval rating with an average rating of 7.49/10 based on 13 reviews. Darren Franich for Entertainment Weekly gave the two-part premiere a collective 'B' grade, praising Martin-Green's performance as the lead and the production design as well as commenting on the \\"undeniable appeal\\" of the \\"introduction of a new ship, the revelation that we're watching that ship's final voyage, the cliffhanger possibility that our new hero is a fallen angel.\\" Writing for TVLine, Dave Nemetz graded the two episodes a 'B+', saying, \\"the nail-bitingly tense premiere delivered a cracking good action story, eye-popping special effects and a number of gasp-worthy twists\\" that was worth the wait. Chris Harnick at E! News considered Martin-Green's performance to be the strongest element of the show, praising her acting as a human raised in a Vulcan world as \\"the most interesting part of the series [which] presents a fascinating window into the world of Star Trek: Discovery.\\" Maureen Ryan of Variety gave muted praise, saying the series \\"has yet to prove itself a worthy successor to The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine. But there are reasons to hope that Discovery will be a promising addition to the Trek canon\\". USA Todays Bill Keveney gave the premiere 2-and-a-half out of four stars, saying it \\"soars in ambition and devotion to Star Trek history and mythology, but stalls with certain plot details and stilted dialogue\\". Merrill Barr of Forbes felt the show was \\"not bad, but it‚Äôs off to a strange start... [it] has every chance from here to become something great, possibly even awards worthy.\\" Patrick Cooley of cleveland.com called the series \\"a bitter disappointment, plagued by bad dialogue, poor storytelling and wooden, bewilderingly stupid characters.\\" References Further reading * External links Streaming at CBS All Access Star Trek: Discovery episodes 2017 American television episodes Fictional battles ","title":"Battle at the Binary Stars"},{"id":"55282743","text":"\\"Context Is for Kings\\" is the third episode of the American television series Star Trek: Discovery, which is set roughly a decade before the events of the original Star Trek series and explores the war between the Federation and the Klingons. The episode was written by showrunners Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts, and Craig Sweeny, from a story by series co-creator Bryan Fuller, Berg, and Harberts. It was directed by producer Akiva Goldsman. Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Michael Burnham, the first Starfleet mutineer who began the war. Series regulars Doug Jones, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, and Jason Isaacs also appear in the episode. The series' writers consider this episode to be the show's equivalent of a pilot, introducing the majority of its main cast, the titular starship Discovery, and the beginning of the season-long story. The episode reused the series' starship sets for both the Discovery and its sister ship Glenn. \\"Context Is for Kings\\" was released on CBS All Access on October 1, 2017. The episode's release was believed to have caused record subscriptions for All Access, and received mostly positive reviews from critics for the new status quo established after the prologue of the previous two episodes. The new cast additions were also praised, particularly Isaacs. Plot Six months after the start of the Federation-Klingon War of 2256, Michael Burnham, having been imprisoned for half a year, is on an unexpected prisoner transfer when an emergency forces her shuttle to be rescued by the USS Discovery. Spending several days on the ship, Burnham is ordered by its captain, the mysterious Gabriel Lorca, to assist with a scientific assignment. Burnham spends hours poring over complex computer code in an attempt to find an error. She overhears Lieutenant Paul Stamets, an astromycologist who is leading the assignment, discuss an upcoming experiment with a colleague serving on another starship; Lorca is soon informed of an incident on the Discoverys sister ship, the USS Glenn, that killed its entire crew. Stamets leads a boarding party, including Burnham, to investigate and finds the dead crew hideously twisted and malformed, as well as a group of Klingons who were killed by an unknown creature. When it attacks the boarding party, Burnham devises a plan to outwit the creature, allowing the rest of the party to escape to the shuttle. Lorca later asks Burnham to work for him, despite her sentence, explaining that he organized the circumstances that led her to him, as he needs strong-minded people such as herself to help him win the war. Burnham challenges him by saying she will not help him develop a weapon that goes against Geneva Convention codes. Lorca says he admires her and wants her on his team because she knows how to think for herself: \\"Universal law is for lackeys; context is for kings\\". He shows her that they are not working on a weapon but on a revolutionary propulsion method. After their conversation, Lorca talks to his chief of security, Commander Ellen Landry, to ensure his \\"package\\" is safely onboard. Landry has secretly transported the creature aboard the Discovery. Production Development On November 2, 2015, CBS announced a new Star Trek television series to premiere in January 2017, \\"on the heels\\" of the original series' 50th anniversary in 2016. In February 2016, Bryan Fuller was announced as the new series' showrunner, but was asked by CBS to step down at the end of October. Gretchen J. Berg and Aaron Harberts replaced him as showrunners. In September 2017, CBS revealed that the series' third episode would be titled \\"Context Is for Kings\\". It was directed by producer Akiva Goldsman. Writing The teleplay for the episode was written by Berg, Harberts, and Craig Sweeny, based on a story by Fuller, Berg, and Harberts. The writers structured the season so that the first two episodes would act as a prologue, with the third episode beginning the series' actual story arc and being considered by them to be more equivalent to a traditional pilot than the show's first episode is. Actor Jason Isaacs noted that a series would not traditionally be able to use that structure, but that Discovery is able to do so because of its streaming format though CBS All Access. Harberts described the episode as one of \\"secrets and mysteries\\" and introducing a version of Starfleet that is at war. The episode also re-introduces protagonist Michael Burnham as resigned to her fate as a lifelong prisoner following her mutiny in the prologue. The story begins six months after the prologue, inspired by film sequels that begin with significant events having transpired since the previous installment such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Burnham's character arc for the episode takes her from not caring about her fate, to being willing to sign up for something new as part of the Discoverys mission. The writers were interested in exploring Burnham's upbringing as the foster child of Amanda Grayson and Sarek, exploring how the human Grayson would have wanted to counter some of Burnham's \\"logical\\" Vulcan teachings, and similarly would have wanted to expand the views of her son Spock by teaching him that \\"logic doesn't dictate everything\\". This led to the introduction of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a book that Grayson read to them as children and which Burnham now carries with her as a talisman to \\"center herself\\". The book also thematically connected to the series with its use of mushrooms, tying into the series' scientific exploration of fungi and spores. Grayson's interest in the works of Lewis Carroll and Spock's awareness of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland were both previously established in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"Once Upon a Planet\\". It was also important to the writers to justify the presence of Cadet Sylvia Tilly, whose optimistic outlook is at odds with the rest of the crew of the Discovery and the tone of the series, by having her prove herself during the character's first away mission. This came in the moment where Tilly spots, and calls out, a Klingon on the derelict starship Glenn, showing the character to be as capable as the other characters. The monstrous creature introduced on the Glenn was described by Harberts as \\"vital\\" to the series, stating that it would be reappearing in future episodes, and that it would serve as a metaphor for Burnham and her character journey in the show. Casting The series stars Sonequa Martin-Green as Burnham, Doug Jones as Saru, Shazad Latif as Ash Tyler, Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets, Mary Wiseman as Tilly, and Isaacs as Gabriel Lorca; Latif does not appear in this episode. Additionally, guest star Rekha Sharma was cast as Discoverys security officer Commander Landry at the end of April 2017. The creature introduced in the episode, referred to as a \\"tardigrade\\" after the real-life micro-animal of the same name, is portrayed in-part by a puppet. It was originally intended to be a full-time member of the Discoverys crew, named Ephraim for the zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze who discovered the real species. However, this was deemed to be impractical. Filming and design Executive producer Akiva Goldsman wanted to incorporate elements of horror when directing the episode. Filming for scenes set on the Glenn took place on the sets previously used for USS Shenzhou in the prologue episodes. Changes made to the sets for filming in this episode include the adding of \\"scratched walls, flickering lights, dangling wires, busted doors\\". The set was decorated with blood and ten corpses, including an actor in Klingon prosthetics portraying a dead member of that species. Another Klingon actor was connected to a pulley system with a special harness and pulled out of shot, to simulate being dragged away by the creature, something that was filmed multiple times to get \\"just right\\". To film the following chase sequence, the actors were followed through the set by a cameraman on a Segway. Those same sets were later redressed to portray the Discovery. The shuttle bay of the Discovery is completely computer-generated, and is the most expensive set in the series due to the visual effects requirements. Goldsman felt that each episode of the series has its \\"own tonal components that are driven by script\\", and that this episode is \\"mysterious and threatening because I felt Burnham‚Äôs circumstance was mysterious and threatening\\". Goldsman embraced this tone, and incorporated elements of the horror genre. He noted that the producers generally wanted the series to be watchable for families, but they also had the freedom to push boundaries with the streaming format of the series, and so some of the horror elements included in the episode would not be appropriate for young children, such as the corpses of the Glenns crew, which were described as \\"swirled up bodies\\" and were designed in Adobe Photoshop. They attempted to indicate this to parents who may be showing the series to children by giving it a \\"TV-MA\\" rating, even though the majority of the episode, and the series as a whole, was not intended to require that higher rating. Lorca is first introduced eating fortune cookies, part of his family backstory and one of the comforts that he is allowed in his ready room. Isaacs had to eat hundreds of fortune cookies in the course of filming the scene, and said he did not want to repeat that experience. Isaacs did note the symbolism of Lorca wanting Burnham to read her fortune, \\"but she doesn't want to do it. The point is that she's gonna create her own fortune by making the right decision by the end of the episode.\\" Saru offering blueberries to Burnham in the episode was a tribute to Fuller who \\"would walk through the offices of Star Trek, and he would offer you a blueberry.\\" Release \\"Context Is for Kings\\" was made available on CBS All Access on October 1, 2017. In Canada, it was broadcast on the specialty channels Space (English) and Z (French), before being streamed on CraveTV. In 188 other countries, the episode was released on Netflix within 24 hours of its U.S. debut. Reception Ratings and viewership The release of the episode led to a record week of subscriptions to All Access, besting the previous record week established by the series' premiere the week before. Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 89% approval rating with an average rating of 8.74/10 based on 19 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Context Is for Kings\\" is \\"a successful soft reboot‚Äîwith its namesake ship and new captain setting the series on a new, more confident course.\\" James Hunt of Den of Geek said, \\"If this is the quality of an average episode then I‚Äôm super-happy with the way this show is turning out.\\" He highlighted the introduction of the Discovery, and its difference from previous Star Trek starships, as well as Isaac's \\"subtlety\\" in portraying Lorca. He did criticize some of the dialogue and its use of exposition, but ended by saying, \\"What I like most about this show is that it hasn‚Äôt forgotten to inject moments of curiosity, wonder and philosophy into the story‚Äîand that makes it enough like Star Trek that I can cope with any other changes.\\" Megan Davies at Digital Spy called the episode \\"the pilot Star Trek: Discovery should have had all along.\\" She noted the expanded cast to support Martin-Green's lead performance, particularly the promoted Saru and introduced Stamets. Davies also noted that the episode \\"has fun with its genre. Here Star Trek plays with the makings of a mystery [and] nowhere does it excel more than when it devotes itself to pure, thrilling horror as it does during the boarding of the USS Glenn.\\" For IGN, Scott Collura scored the episode a \\"great\\" 8.4 out of 10, feeling that the wait for the introduction of the Discovery and its crew was worth it. Collura liked Lorca, felt Tilly was \\"a ton of fun\\", and called Saru \\"a highlight of the show\\". Alan Sepinwall, writing for Uproxx, felt the shift from the prologue for the episode was \\"jarring, and raises the question of why two episodes needed to be devoted to setting it up.\\" However, he was positive of the greater focus on the Starfleet characters, including the \\"quiet, suspicious version\\" of Burnham, as well as the featured science. Sepinwall concluded, \\"I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to spend a lot of time watching the show Discovery was in its first two hours, despite liking several performances and a lot of the production choices. The show it seems to be now is one I‚Äôm much more enthusiastic about.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode an 'A-', calling the change from the prologue disorienting, but feeling that the different nature of the Discovery and its crew was well established. Handlen particularly noted the action scene where Burnham quotes from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, finding it \\"utterly unexpected, and it hooked me good.\\" Reviewing for The New York Times, Sopan Deb found the episode to be convoluted and gloomy, and felt that many of the characters, especially Burnham, did not work because the audience had not been given time to become affectionate of them before they started making bold actions. Deb did say, \\"Whatever it is, it isn't boring. It has action and strong casting\\", specifically highlighting Isaacs as Lorca and Goldsman's direction of the horror scenes. In 2020, ScreenRant noted that this episode had a ranking of 7.7 on IMDB based on user rankings, placing it as the tenth best episode of Star Trek: Discovery including season one and two.

The character is the first black woman to lead a Star Trek television series, as well as the first leading character that has never been a Starfleet captain (though Burnham is the deceased captain of the ISS Shenzhou in the mirror universe). Bryan Fuller conceived the character based on the cultural impact of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura, Mae Jemison and Ruby Bridges. She is also revealed as the foster sister to Spock (Ethan Peck). Burnham is an orphan after her parents are killed by Klingons, until she is taken in by Sarek (James Frain). Controversy arose among fans from the decision to connect her history to Spock's family, with fans debating whether this is consistent with established continuity. Development of the character was largely praised by critics leading up to the debut for having a black woman lead for the first time in Star Trek history and reviews of Martin-Green's performance have been positive. Creation and development In December 2016, it was announced that Martin-Green would serve as the series lead of Star Trek: Discovery, with the character initially named \\"Rainsford\\". In previous iterations of Star Trek, Spock had never mentioned a sister. Executive producer Alex Kurtzman has explained that the specifics of Burnham's backstory would be revealed in a way that would not break the existing canon continuity. Unlike previous Star Trek leads, Burnham was not made a starship captain, \\"to see a character from a different perspective on the starship‚Äîone who has different dynamic relationships with a captain, with subordinates, it gave us richer context\\". The character was originally to be referred to only by the name Number One, to honor the character of that name portrayed by Majel Barrett in the original Star Trek pilot \\"The Cage.\\" With changes in the pre-production storyline, the character is found guilty of mutiny and no longer a First Officer by the end of the pilot episode. Thus, the Michael Burnham name was revealed during the first episode, quickly making \\"Number One\\" her informal name, the same as First Officer William Riker's informal name on the series Star Trek: The Next Generation. Series creator Bryan Fuller deliberately gave Martin-Green's character a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads (George, Jaye and Chuck) in three of his previous series. Martin-Green decided that the character was named after her father. Executive producer Aaron Harberts spoke to TV Guide and explained the reason for calling the character a traditionally male name, explaining, \\"We've worked on many shows with Bryan and it's a motif. It's his signature move to name his lead women with names that would typically be associated as male.\\" He felt the name was \\"cool and different\\" and pitched it himself explaining, \\"[I was] thinking of female columnist Michael Sneed, who writes for the Chicago Sun-Times, and The Bangles' bassist Michael Steele.\\" He added, \\"And, of course, an archangel is named Michael as well, and it just had a lot of potency for us.\\" Sonequa Martin-Green expressed enthusiasm about the name, liking the symbolism and anticipating a more gender-fluid and equal opportunity future. Of the name, she said, \\"I appreciated the statement it makes all on its own to have this woman with this male name, just speaking of the amelioration of how we see men and women in the future.\\" Bryan Fuller had numerous inspirations for conceiving the character of Michael Burnham. He cited the cultural impact of Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura saying, \\"I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship [as Lt. Uhura in The Original Series]\\". Another inspiration came from the legacy of Ruby Bridges, the first black child to attend an all-white elementary school in Louisiana, as well as Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel in space. Martin-Green referred to her character as being \\"the only human to have not just attended the Vulcan Science Academy but excelled as well, [which] speaks to Burnham's intellect and just sheer level of intelligence\\". She referred to her character as \\"highly disciplined, highly principled, and the Vulcan-Human dichotomy that lives within her is emblematic of her personality. It is the two realities living within me at all times.\\" Casting Auditioning process Martin-Green making a Vulcan hand sign in 2019. The casting process was difficult for producers. They searched long and hard to find an actor to pull off Burnham's divided nature between Vulcan and human. Harberts said, \\"We read a lot of people and they either went way too robotic and chilly or way too emotional. What's beautiful about Sonequa's performance is she's capable of playing two, three, four things at once. She's got such a great command of her craft, she's able to be aloof but warm; logical but able to surrender her emotional side to the audience.\\" Alex Kurtzman felt the character's portrayal needed to have \\"remarkable duality inside her\\" between being \\"highly emotional\\" while also being \\"contained\\". \\"Unlike Spock, who is half-human, half-Vulcan, she is all human, but she's been trained with the kind of Vulcan emotional-suppression ideology, and that is very challenging for her... you can see that wrestling match going on in every moment. That was the single most important thing to define the character, and I think we just had a sense that [Sonequa] intuitively understood it.\\" He went further to express the challenges in casting an actor for the part saying, \\"It's a tough thing to learn with actors. You either have the ability to roll that off your tongue, or you don't. And if you don't, everything kind of trips over itself... And when [Sonequa] read, we all breathed a massive sigh of relief, because she brought an instant authenticity to it. It was very clear that the language was not going to be difficult for her.\\" Sonequa Martin-Green first met with Discovery co-creator Bryan Fuller at New York Comic-Con in October 2016. Fuller talked to her about Burnham, a human orphan raised on planet Vulcan alongside Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from the original series, leading to a conflict with her two cultural identities. Knowing that her character Sasha would be killed off The Walking Dead, she shot a video audition. However, AMC refused to release her from her contract, leading CBS to look elsewhere. Fuller revealed that he had long set his sights on Martin-Green to star in Discovery, but CBS pushed back because AMC would not release her from her contract until Sasha's death was shown on-screen. CBS' second premiere date delay from May to September was due to the restrictions of Martin-Green's contract, though the first delay opened the door for her to land the role. She auditioned in person in December, and then began shooting in January. On getting the part, she expressed nervousness and excitement saying, \\"When I first got started, I had my freak-out phase. I had my almost catatonic moment where I thought, 'What is happening?' And I knew very quickly that I couldn't live there and that I couldn't create there. I owed it to the story and I owed it to the legacy to get it together. And I had to focus myself in gratitude. I had to focus myself on the passion for the vision for the story that we're doing.\\" Announcement The casting for Michael Burnham, under the pseudonym \\"Commander Rainsford\\" leaked in December 2016, with many speculating Martin-Green's previous role as Sasha on The Walking Dead would come to an end. Following the announcement, Nichelle Nichols tweeted \\"All my love @SonequaMG, I've been smiling since I heard. You're gonna knock em dead.\\" Charlie Jane Anders for Wired felt Martin-Green's casting fulfilled Gene Roddenberry's ultimate vision saying, \\"It's all too easy to see Star Trek's humanism as merely a matter of embracing science and rejecting barbarism‚Äîbut that's missing what makes Trek's version of humanism so powerful. Diversity was always a key part of Star Trek's vision of a better future for humanity. In the ideal world of the 24th century, every human being has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, either in the sciences or elsewhere; anything less doesn't represent real progress.\\" Showrunner of The Walking Dead admitted it was unfortunate that the casting leak happened, spoiling events to come, but that \\"The folks over at Star Trek got lucky with the timing\\". On the importance and impact of the role, Martin-Green said, \\"My casting says that the sky is the limit for all of us. I think what we're seeing now in our media is this push to diminish and to devalue and to make people feel that the sky is not the limit for them, that they are meant for the ground. So having me as the first black female lead of a Star Trek just blasts that into a million pieces. I am eternally grateful that the diverse casting of our show means that we are now a part of the conversation and hopefully a part of making the world a better place, as clich√© as this sounds. Because I really believe it and think its vital for us all right now\\". Nichols and Martin-Green both posed together on the red carpet at the Star Trek: Discovery premiere. Martin-Green shared on Instagram that Nichols whispered, \\"Enjoy this time. It's yours now.\\" Sonequa Martin-Green praised Nichols thereafter saying, \\"What a blessing, what a woman. I stand on your shoulders Nichelle Nichols\\". Diversity backlash Following the release of the first trailer for Discovery in May 2017, some fans characterised the series as a \\"white genocide in space\\", given what they perceived as a lack of white representation. The decision to create a diverse cast sparked debate online on the question of what had been referred to as 'forced diversity'. Media outlets, including The Chicago Tribune and The New Yorker referred to the impact of Uhura and the kiss between the character of Uhura and of Captain Kirk as being the first interracial kiss on American television, and its subsequent societal impact that Trek fans would be aware of. George Takei, the actor who played Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek: The Original Series offered his view on the issue of cast diversity in the Star Trek franchise. He said, \\"You know, when you go out into space, you're going to have even greater diversity. These so-called trolls haven't seen a single episode of the new series because it hasn't been aired. And they don't know the history of 'Star Trek,' that Gene Rodenberry created this with the idea of finding strength in our diversity.\\" Martin-Green spoke out on the criticism, saying she \\"would encourage [critics of the diverse cast] to key into the essence and spirit of Star Trek that has made it the legacy it is‚Äîand that's looking across the way to the person sitting in front of you and realizing you are the same, that they are not separate from you, and we are all one. That's something 'Star Trek' has always upheld and I completely believe that is why it's been a mainstay in society in the hearts of so many people for so many decades. [...] It's one of the foundational principles of Star Trek and I feel if you miss that then you miss the legacy itself. I'm incredibly proud to be the lead of this show and be at the forefront of an iteration of Star Trek that's from the eyes of a black woman that's never been done before, though obviously there's been other forms of diversity that have been innovated by Trek. I feel like we're taking another step forward, which I think all stories should do. We should go boldly where nobody has gone before and stay true to that.\\" Appearances Background Burnham was born to human parents, who were killed when she was a child during a Klingon raid on a Human-Vulcan research facility on Doctari Alpha, where the family lived. She was then adopted by the Vulcan ambassador Sarek (James Frain) and his human wife Amanda (Mia Kirshner), who are also the biological parents of Starfleet officer Spock, and moved to the Vulcan homeworld. She was the first human to attend both the Vulcan Learning Center and Vulcan Science Academy, training as a xenoanthropologist. After completing the academy she was brought by Sarek, who shared his Katra with Burnham, to the USS Shenzhou to rejoin her people. The decision to make Burnham related to the history of original series character Spock was controversial. Beth Elderkin for io9 decided that it \\"breaks canon\\" and that \\"It seems unlike Spock to completely ignore someone who seemed to be a major part of his life‚Äîespecially one who came into his life after such tragedy.\\" In contrast, Laurie Ulster of TrekMovie.com felt the decision was \\"not that big of a deal\\", clashing with Elderkin's point about Spock, citing the fact that Spock never mentioned his half-brother Sybok until he showed up, or revealed his parents were Sarek and Amanda, as well as the numerous \\"secret siblings\\" placed in Star Trek. Star Trek: Discovery =Mutiny= In the series premiere of Discovery, she has already served under Captain Georgiou on the USS Shenzhou for seven years. The series opens with Shenzhou encountering the Klingons, with Burnham committing an act of mutiny, breaking Starfleet regulations to give the order to fire first, avoiding a full-scale war, in an attempt to save her captain and ship against the Klingons. Her plan is unsuccessful and she is detained. In \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\", Burnham escapes the brig and convinces Georgiou to take T'Kuvma hostage. However, T'Kuvma kills Georgiou. In a moment of emotional weakness, Burnham kills T'Kuvma, making him a martyr. She is convicted of mutiny, stripped of rank, and sentenced to life in prison. This mutiny is the cornerstone of the entire setup for the series; however, it also became one of the first of many complaints about the show's apparent disregard for Star Trek canon and continuity. In the Star Trek episode \\"The Tholian Web\\", while investigating the loss of the U.S.S. Defiant, Captain Kirk and crew find that the entire crew of the Defiant was dead. The entire crew went wild and killed each other. In that episode Chekhov asks Spock specifically if there has ever been a mutiny on a starship before, to which Spock answers, \\"absolutely no record of such an occurrence\\", which is not possible, since some 10 years earlier Spock's own adopted sister became the first and most infamous mutineer in Starfleet history. At the end of Discovery season 2 they tried to rectify some of the canon issues by having Starfleet order Spock and the others never to reveal what happened to the USS Discovery, or even its existence, but the mutiny happened on the USS Shenzhou, and was well known to Starfleet personnel, as seen in \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\" and \\"The Tholian Web\\" =USS Discovery= In \\"Context Is for Kings\\", USS Discoverys Captain Gabriel Lorca brings Burnham back to duty with a temporary war-time assignment as a scientist on his crew, praising her risk-taking behaviour as valuable in the war. She is met with hostility among the Discovery crew, being viewed as responsible for starting the war with the Klingons. Burnham eventually befriends her roommate, Sylvia Tilly (Mary Wiseman). In \\"The Butcher's Knife Cares Not for the Lamb's Cry\\", Lorca orders Burnham and Landry (Rekha Sharma) to find a way to weaponize Ripper, a violent macroscopic Tardigrade found on the USS Glenn. Burnham hypothesizes that Ripper's behavior on the Glenn was defensive in nature and that he was not inherently dangerous, since biological analysis showed him to be herbivorous. But with the Klingons attacking Corvan II, Landry was desperate for results and fired a phaser at him, causing him to maul her to death. She also overcomes her fear of opening the last will of Georgiou through Tilly's coercion. She learns Georgiou left her with a telescope, a prized possession handed down through her family for hundreds of years, noting Burnham as a curious explorer and believing she has her own command at this point. In \\"Choose Your Pain\\", Burnham voices her concerns about the spore drive jumps used on Ripper as Saru is acting captain upon Lorca's abduction by Klingons. Saru is outraged at Burnham for turning the spore-drive offline without his knowledge, and searching for compatible DNA sequences to replace Ripper. Burnham suggests a human host replacement would be possible, but Saru disregards her point, calling her a predator. Later, Burnham asks if he is afraid of her, but he tells her he is jealous because he wanted to learn everything from Georgiou and she did instead, and rather than she become captain and teach him, her actions led him to be unprepared as acting captain for today. Burnham gives Saru the telescope Georgiou gave her, feeling she doesn't deserve it. Saru lets Burnham free Ripper back into space, and Stamets becomes the host replacement needed, injecting himself with tardigrade DNA. In \\"Lethe\\", Sarek is almost killed and Burnham is forced to save him. She discovers he chose his biological son Spock over her, as Sarek was only given the option of sending one child to the Vulcan Expeditionary Group, with the Vulcans considering both children \\"experiments\\" (half-human and full human indoctrinated in Vulcan culture). The decision is ultimately pointless as Spock chose Starfleet, after Burnham was forced to go. After retrieving Sarek, Burnham attempts to get Sarek to open up to her about their encounter. Sarek pretends to be unaware, but Burnham can tell he is lying, saying he can do better. She says they will have the conversation one day, and leaves calling him \\"father\\" to spite him after he said they were technically not family because they are not related. She also develops a friendship with Ash Tyler (Shazad Latif), who helps her through Sarek attempting to push her away. In \\"Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad\\", Harry Mudd (Rainn Wilson) takes over Discovery and keeps the ship in a time loop so he can complete his mission to sell the ship to the Klingons. Burnham appears uncomfortable as, during this time, a party is occurring and she struggles with her romantic feelings for Tyler. Stamets (Anthony Rapp), the only one aware of the time loop, warns Burnham while also helping her with her feelings for Tyler. Burnham and Tyler dance and kiss, before Mudd kills him. Burnham manipulates Mudd into turning back time again to save him, revealing who she is and how high a prize she is for the Klingons. She kills herself to convince Mudd to do so, although the next time around, Burnham successfully tricks Mudd and he is sent away. Burnham and Tyler are left to imagine their first kiss, which they only know of because Stamets has told them about it happening. In \\"Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum\\", Burnham and Tyler go with Saru to the planet Pahvo as part of a plan to overcome the Klingons' cloaking technology, where they kiss again and renew their romance. In \\"Into the Forest I Go\\", Burnham convinces Lorca to let her enter the Klingon Sarcophagus ship, where Burnham gets into a fight with Kol (Kenneth Mitchell), ultimately escaping and retrieving Philippa's badge. An attack is made on Kol's ship, blowing it up. Burnham notices Tyler's PTSD attack caused by seeing L'Rell (Mary Chieffo) and later learns that Tyler allowed her to sexually abuse him in order to stay alive. =Mirror Universe= In \\"Despite Yourself\\", the USS Discovery transports to the mirror universe. Burnham learns she earned the rank of captain on the ISS Shenzhou. During her career, she won medals for Valor, for being a Master of Poisons, and for 100 kills. While in command of the ISS Shenzhou, she was ordered to hunt down Gabriel Lorca, who was attempting a coup against the emperor. Her shuttlecraft was destroyed during this operation and she is presumed dead. Burnham is forced to disguise as her Terran counterpart on the ISS Shenzhou in order to retrieve the data files on the Constitution-class USS Defiant, to uncover how it crossed into the mirror universe's past. Burnham and Lorca play the part of their Terran selves. Ensign Connor, who is now Captain Connor, attempts to kill Burnham in an attempt to maintain his new position, but fails. The ISS Shenzhou applaud Burnham for her killing as she takes the captain's chair. Later, Burnham appears exhausted keeping up the act, and goes to her quarters where she and Tyler, who joined Burnham as her personal bodyguard, have sex. In \\"The Wolf Inside\\", Burnham becomes increasingly agitated with her facade as Mirror Burnham, and questions how long you can keep a facade up until you actually become something you initially weren't. She is alarmed by Mirror Saru, who is a nameless slave in this universe, and decides to name him Saru in honor of her friend. Mirror Saru is shocked by her friendly gesture. Burnham is tasked to destroy a rebel base on the planet Harlak. Instead, she and Tyler opt to form a secret alliance with the Vulcans, Klingons, Andorians and Tellarites who oppose the Terran Empire. Voq appears, the mirror universe counterpart of the Klingon she fought at the Binary Stars, and asks Mirror Sarek, known as The Prophet, to mind meld with Burnham to see if her intentions are pure. Mirror Sarek is taken aback by Burnham's memories, and concludes she is a compassionate person who means them no harm. Burnham becomes curious of Voq's ability to forge alliances with other alien races, in order to find the solution to the Klingon war in her universe. Voq's explanation triggers Tyler who speaks in Klingon and attacks Voq. Burnham convinces Mirror Voq to spare Tyler's life. When Burnham and Tyler return to the ISS Shenzhou, having faked the attack, she confronts Tyler. Tyler admits he doesn't think he is actually Ash Tyler. It becomes apparent Tyler is actually Voq and speaking with Mirror Voq set off his true nature, having been brought on the USS Discovery originally as a sleeper agent all along. Burnham is confused, but then realizes Tyler is the one she fought at the Binary Stars. Tyler, now mentally fully turned into Voq, attempts to kill her. Burnham is unable to defend herself, and Mirror Saru arrives and attacks Tyler, saving her. Burnham fakes Tyler's execution, actually transporting him to the Discovery ship together with the files from the where he is held captive. Later, Burnham is dismayed to learn her falsities at Harlak have been uncovered by the silent emperor, who turns out to be her former captain Philippa Georgiou's mirror version. In \\"Vaulting Ambition\\", Burnham and Lorca are transported to the ISS Charon, as the revelation that Georgiou is the emperor weighs down on her, making her feel the situation is a reckoning for her betrayal of her own Georgiou. Lorca refuses to bow to Georgiou, and is taken to an agony booth. Georgiou suspects Burnham of deception, and holding a knife to her neck asks why she has come here, revealing she is aware that she conspired to kill her and take her throne with Lorca. Burnham is left shocked by this revelation of her mirror counterpart's betrayal as well. When she refers to the emperor as \\"Philippa\\", she is outraged, as she would normally refer to her as \\"mother\\". Later, Burnham reveals prior to her execution that she is from another universe, using Prime Philippa's insignia as proof. Emperor Georgiou agrees to make a deal with Burnham to exchange the spore drive technology in exchange for her freedom to go home. Later, Burnham learns more about her mirror counterpart's history. In this universe, due to Terran supremacy, rather than Sarek and Amanda raising Michael after her parents were killed, Emperor Philippa Georgiou did instead. However, Mirror Burnham's quest to hunt down Lorca appears to be a ruse, as she was conspiring against her own adoptive mother to kill her and take her throne with Lorca, who Mirror Burnham once viewed as a father figure, until she grew up and it became romantic. Georgiou tells Burnham about Lorca planning to \\"cross time and space itself to take what was rightfully his\\" and Burnham puts the pieces together, along with Georgiou's sensitivity to light (the single biological difference between the Terrans and humans), that Lorca is from the mirror universe and their crossing over was not an accident. In \\"What's Past is Prologue\\", Burnham works out a plan to deliver Georgiou to Lorca in the same way she planned. Burnham tells Lorca she will stay in exchange for Discoverys safe passage home, but it is a ruse, as Georgiou and Burnham begin attacking and killing Lorca's men. Eventually, Burnham gets the upper hand on Lorca with a phaser, telling him that they would've helped him get home, because that's who Starfleet is, and that is who she is, which is why she won't kill him. Georgiou, however, kills him instead. She then allows Burnham to go back home, with her reign as emperor gone given Lorca's rebellion, deciding to die killing Lorca's men. However, Burnham saves Georgiou at the last minute, holding onto her, as they are transported back to the Discovery and into the prime universe. =Ending the Federation‚ÄìKlingon War= In \\"The War Without, The War Within\\", the Discovery jumps nine months ahead in 2257, with the Federation suffering significant losses in the war with the Klingons. Burnham reveals to Admiral Cornwell and Sarek about the arrival of their guest, Emperor Georgiou. Burnham asks Cornwell to give Emperor Georgiou political asylum, feeling sympathy for her, despite not being her Georgiou. Later, Tilly convinces Burnham to confront Ash, who is now fully recovered with dual memories, feeling deep remorse for Voq's actions. Sarek tells her not to regret loving someone, encouraging her further. Burnham ultimately ends their relationship. Ash begs her, saying he can't make it without her, but Burnham explains she was lost after the battle of the binary stars, and having to reclaim life is punishing and solitary. In the season one finale, \\"Will You Take My Hand?\\", Emperor Georgiou poses as Prime Georgiou, enlisted by Starfleet to end the war however she sees fit in exchange for her freedom. Burnham, Tilly and Tyler accompany her to Qo'nos. Ultimately, Burnham is forced to stop Georgiou's genocidal attack on the Klingon home planet, outraged at Cornwell and Starfleet for enabling the act. Burnham manipulates Georgiou to give her the explosive device, by telling her if she doesn't, she will have to watch her daughter die again. Georgiou reluctantly agrees and walks off to her freedom. Burnham offers L'Rell a peace treaty, to call off the Klingons' planned invasion on Earth in exchange for the device as a measure of peace and diplomacy in order to end the war. Ash reassures a reluctant L'Rell to take charge. After the incident, Burnham's act of diplomacy in finishing the war ends with her, and many of the Discovery crew, decorated by Starfleet with the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions. Burnham is fully reinstated as a Commander in Starfleet, her record is expunged, she is pardoned by the Federation President, and she becomes the Chief Science Officer for the Discovery. Burnham and Tyler decide to go their separate ways, Tyler planning to find a union between humans and Klingons with L'Rell, and Burnham back aboard Discovery. On their course to Vulcan to pick up the new Discovery captain, they receive a transmission from Captain Christopher Pike of the USS Enterprise. Novels Prior to the release of the television series, an original tie-in novel taking place in 2255, one year prior to the pilot, was announced. The novel titled Star Trek Discovery: Desperate Hours sees Burnham face the challenge needed in being a first officer upon recent promotion. The synopsis describes Burnham's journey as \\"To save thousands of innocent lives, Burnham must infiltrate the alien ship. But to do so she needs to face the truth of her troubled past, and seek the aid of a man she has tried to avoid her entire life‚Äîuntil now.\\" She also works with her foster brother Spock, who visits the Shenzhou along with Captain Pike. Reception Writing for E! News, Chris Harnick reviewed the first two episodes of Discovery‚Äî\\"The Vulcan Hello\\" and \\"Battle at the Binary Stars\\"‚Äîand considered Martin-Green's performance the strongest element of the show. He praised her acting as a human raised in a Vulcan world by saying, \\"[T]he emotional conflict between the two ideologies in Michael Burnham is perhaps the most interesting part of the series, and presents a fascinating window into the world of Star Trek: Discovery.\\" Writing for the episode \\"Context Is for Kings\\", Mallory Ortberg of Vulture referred to Martin-Green as \\"the standout\\" who is \\"given a lot more to work with and is, in turn, captivating, charming (I didn't know I wanted to see her scrabbling through a series of Jefferies tubes reciting Alice in Wonderland to herself until it happened), and heartbreakingly winsome.\\" Chaim Gartenberg for The Verge praised the uniqueness of Burnham in comparison to previous Trek protagonists saying, \\"[she] isn't like any protagonist we've seen in Star Trek so far, and not only because she doesn't command a starship or space station. She's a far more rounded, human character than any of the previous captains, with some serious trauma from a Klingon attack in her youth that's left her predisposed to hate the warrior race. And while Star Trek has plumbed the 'main character has demons' well in the past‚Äîmost notably with Sisko in Deep Space Nine, and Picard in the later films, when it comes to the Borg‚ÄîBurnham feels far more compelling for not being a flawless human being in other respects, as her series-protagonist predecessors were.\\" TV Guide listed Martin-Green in the ranking of \\"The 25 Best TV Performances of 2017\\" coming at 14. The article highlighted, \\"Martin-Green has delivered the sort of performance that lights up every moment she's on screen. This is how stars are born.\\" CultureFlys David Bedwell included Burnham in their list of \\"11 Best TV Characters of 2017\\" saying, \\"With their first ever black female lead and a character that's hardly straight-laced, Sonequa Martin-Green gets a lot to sink her teeth into. Variety added Martin-Green among the list of Top Breakout TV Stars of 2017 in the role of Burnham. Joe Otterson said, \\"Despite a lot of negative news coming out ahead of \\"Discovery's\\" premiere (including multiple premiere date delays), Martin-Green deftly took on the challenge of leading the new installment of the iconic sci-fi franchise. Her portrayal of convicted Starfleet mutineer Michael Burnham made the new show truly binge-worthy.\\" Martin-Green was chosen as TVLine performer of the week for the episode \\"The Wolf Inside\\", as she \\"conveyed the resulting shock in gut-wrenching fashion, her eyes welling up with tears as Burnham was forced to point a phaser at the man she thought she loved.\\" They went further saying, \\"Equally adept at big action scenes and quiet character moments, Martin-Green has been the glue holding Star Trek: Discovery together all season long‚Äîand all those weeks of repressed emotion just made this week's splendid showcase all the more impactful. Here's hoping Burnham lives long... and prospers.\\" In reviewing the full season, Marissa Martinelli of Slate felt that Martin-Green saved Discovery from \\"getting lost in a maze of plot twists [...] As a human raised by Vulcans, it would have been easy to make Burnham yet another Spock or Data, her humanity buried under layers and layers of logic. Instead, Martin-Green plays her with a fierce charisma and warmth, making Burnham not only a compass in the wilderness but a light in the darkness, too.\\" Although the reviewer also felt Burnham's arc wrapped up \\"too neatly\\". Some critics had a negative reaction to Burnham's arc. Andy Vandervell for Wired expressed disappointment in the conclusion of Burnham's first season arc saying, \\"I can see what they were trying to do with the finale in completing Michael Burnham's journey from mutineer to saviour of the Federation, both literally and figuratively, but the execution was so clumsy and anti-climactic it just undercut all the emotional weight of her story.\\" Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club commented, \\"I can sort of see how Burnham changed (the trip to the Mirror Universe taught her the consequences of brutal thinking), but the show has done such a terrible job at establishing the character and motivations of Starfleet and the Federation that the sudden decision to commit murder on such a massive, unprecedented scale is at once shocking and utterly weightless.\\" Liz Shannon Miller for IndieWire and James Luxford for Metro appreciated the conclusions of Burnham's arc. Miller said, \\"Burnham's lengthy speech to the council awarding her and her fellow crewmen with well-deserved honors had plenty of standout moments. But there's something interesting about her choice to invoke Voq's official title within the Klingon Empire, which speaks to how both civilizations are now struggling to sort out their place in the world\\", while Luxford commented, \\"It's great to see Burnham redeemed.\\" Scott Collura for IGN said, \\"There's a nice symmetry to Burnham and Voq/Tyler's journeys between the pilot episode and this finale, with Michael once again staging a sort of mutiny, only this time doing so for all the right reasons and with the support of her friends too.\\" In 2017, Screen Rant ranked the Michael Burnham the 6th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe, in between Worf and Spock. In 2019, Cinema Blend ranked Michael Burnham the sixth best Star Trek Starfleet character of all time. In 2019, Michael Burnham was ranked the number one sexiest Star Trek character by Syfy.

In the 19th century, it was referred to as the ‚ÄúArab War‚Äù, despite few actual Arabs being involved.Kalinga (1980), p. 209 Although these conflicts predate formal endorsement of a British Central Africa Protectorate west of Lake Malawi in 1891,Rotberg, p.15 European involvement, both by the African Lakes Company and by Germans attempting to prevent Swahili slave trading around Lake Tanganyika in German East Africa, had upset the previous balance between the Ngonde and their neighbours and created the conditions for this conflict.Kalinga (1980), p. 218 Situation before the conflict The area to the west of northern Lake Malawi was occupied by two established indigenous peoples, the Tumbuka and Ngonde, and the recently arrived Ngoni. Although the Tumbuka were already involved in the East African ivory trade, in the 1820s and 1830s Swahili traders from the Indian Ocean coast entered the area and displaced the earlier local merchants. These traders, who were backed by Indian financiers in Zanzibar, were as much interested in slaves as ivory. Finally, in the late 1870s, the African Lakes Company began trading in ivory along the shores of Lake Malawi, establishing its trading posts there in the early 1880s. Local peoples The Tumbuka probably entered the area between the Luangwa valley and northern Lake Malawi in the 15th century. At the start of the 18th century, they formed a number of groups, of which that known as the Henga was an important one, and they lived in small, independent communities without a central organisation, that were spread thinly over this area.Douglas, pp. 52-3 By the mid-18th century, traders dressed ‚Äúas Arabs‚Äù, although coming from the Unyamwezi region of what is now Tanzania, were involved in trading for ivory and to some extent slaves as far inland as the Luangwa valley. They formed alliances with groups of Henga, and their leader established a dynasty ruling a federation of small chiefdoms around the lakeshore. By the 1830s, this Chikulamayembe (also called Chikuramaybe) dynasty was in decline and the area reverted to a state of political and military disorganisation.McCracken (2012), pp. 22, 26 The Ngonde (as they are known in Malawi) occupy the north- western shore of Lake Malawi south of the Songwe River are an offshoot of the Nyakyusa people, who live north of that river in Tanzania. The Ngonde probably moved into Malawi around 1600 and densely settled the area between the Songwe and North Rukuru rivers. Their political organisation involved with relatively strong local chiefs, and a paramount chief or Kyungu from one of two princely lineages. The Kyungu was primarily a religious leader with limited power over the local chiefs.Douglas, pp. 72-4 Because the environment of the Karonga plain was favourable for their mixed farming practices, the Ngonde gradually extended the area they occupied, but were not involved in ivory trading networks before the late 19th century.McCracken (2012), p. 22 The Ngoni of Mbelwa (also known as M'mbelwa or Mombera) were a branch of Zwangendaba‚Äôs Ngoni, which began its migration from South Africa between 1819 and 1822, eventually reaching southern Tanzania and remained there until Zwangendaba‚Äôs death in the mid-1840s. After this, his followers split into several groups, one of which under his son Mbelwa settled permanently in what is now the Mzimba district of northern Malawi around 1855.Thompson, pp. 6-7, 12-13, 16 Mbelwa‚Äôs Ngoni treated the Henga as a subject population, exacting tribute and taking captives through raiding. These captives were rarely sold to the Swahili traders, but retained as unfree agricultural workers or enrolled in Ngoni regiments.Thompson, pp. 19-22 Some Henga soldiers fled back to their original homeland around 1879 but were attacked by the Ngoni in 1881 and forced to move north into Ngonde territory, where the Ngonde settled them as a buffer against their enemies.Thompson, pp. 26-7Lamba, pp. 20-1 Zwangendaba‚Äôs Ngoni had raided the Ngonde in the 1840s and Mbelwa‚Äôs Ngoni did so in the 1850s and 1870s. Each time, the Ngonde had been forced to surrender many cattle, so they feared further raids.Kalinga (1980), p. 211 Advent of the Swahili and Europeans Around 1880, a group of Swahili traders who were established in the elephant-rich Luangwa valley sent one of their number, Mlozi bin Kazbadema from Ujiji, now in Tanzania, to act as their agent in the area to the north-west of Lake Malawi. He headed a party which established a camp near Mbande Hill, the seat of the Ngonde paramount chief, about 15 miles inland from the lake, and a stockade at Chilumba on Lake Malawi, from where ivory and slaves could be shipped across the lake. This was followed by other stockades, from which Mlozi also carried out an active trade in ivory with the African Lakes Company‚Äôs depot at Karonga.Kalinga (1980), pp. 209McCracken (2012), pp. 27, 51 Contemporary Europeans in East Africa described these traders as Arabs, one writer dividing them into three classes: a few ‚ÄúWhite Arabs‚Äù from Oman, other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Iran or Balochistan and the majority, either Muslim ‚ÄúMswahili‚Äù from the east coast of Africa or Nyamwezi people from Unyamwezi, who imitated Arab dress and customs but were only rarely Muslim. Other Nyamwezi who had not adopted Arab ways and who acted as the traders‚Äô armed guards were known as Ruga-Ruga.Fotheringham, pp. 12-13, 39 The African Lakes Company, which cooperated closely with the Scottish missions, began its transport and trading concern that aimed to replace the slave trade by legitimate commerce and develop European influence in 1878.Pachai (1967), p. 57 Its local managers, the brothers John Moir and Frederick Moir concentrated on trading ivory rather than cash crops, facing stiff completion from established Swahili merchants. In 1883, the company set up a base in Karonga to exchange ivory for trade goods.McCraken (2012), p. 49 Growth of tensions Trading rivalries The popularity of the so-called Arab traders arose from the ready supply of a wide range of trade goods they brought, not only guns and ammunition, but also iron tools and utensils, and cloth. This varied supply, for which African chiefs were prepared to exchange slaves as well as ivory, could not be matched by the African Lakes Company's intermittent supplies of European goods.Lamba, pp. 15-16 The Swahili initially had good relations with the Ngonde, but as many of their stockades were built in the area where the Henga had been settled, the Ngonde began to distrust both the Henga and the Swahili. Initially, relations between Mlozi and Low Monteith Fotheringham, the African Lakes Company's local representative, were cordial, but their relationship later deteriorated, partly because of the company's delays in supplying goods in exchange for ivory, its unwillingness to provide guns or ammunition and its limited supply of other trade goods, and also because the Swahili traders turned more to slaving and began to attack the Ngonde communities that the company had promised to protect.McCracken (2012), pp. 51-2 The African Lakes Company's failure lay in part with its lack of sufficient finances to realise its ambitious plans, but also because it thought that trading in ivory and in slaves were intimately connected, as David Livingstone among others had observed recently enslaved Africans being forced to carry ivory to the coast. However, by the 1870s, most ivory porters were paid specialists, not slaves, and the relation between in ivory and slaves was an inverse one: the increasing European demand for ivory led to a depletion of the elephant herds in many areas, whose people were then forced to sell slaves in exchange for the trade goods they wanted, which they had formerly bartered ivory to acquire.Lamba, pp. 17-18 After spending several years trying unsuccessfully to undermine the Swahili trading networks, by 1884 the African Lakes Company was almost bankrupt. It blamed the Swahili for this, and tried to revive its fortunes by making treaties with Ngonde chiefs on the Karonga lakeshore, with a view to preventing them trading with the Swahili traders. These treaties were not only commercial but promised protection, which the Ngonde interpreted as protection against the Swahili and Henga and not only from the Ngoni, which is what the company had intended. Although the African Lakes Company was formed with the benevolent aims of cooperating with the Scottish missions and combating the slave trade, its local agents claimed to have made a series of treaties with local chiefs around its trading station at Karonga. There was little documentation for these, some of which may have been spurious, but several treaties offered protection and claimed to transfer sovereignty over the territory involved to the company, which may have had the ambition to become a Chartered company.Pachai (1978), pp. 36, 151-7, 171Kalinga (1980), pp. 216-7 This ambition was strongly opposed by missionaries based in Blantyre, south of Lake Malawi and Hawes, the Consul to the Lake Region, but initially supported by missionaries based further north in Livingstonia.McCracken (1977), pp. 199-200 Indigenous volatility The Ngonde were concerned both about Mbelwa's Ngoni, even though the latter were settled some distance to the south, and about the Nyakyusa people to the north. Although the Nyakyusa were closely related to the Ngonde, they nevertheless raided their more affluent relatives. To protect their northern border, the Ngonde resettled those Henga warriors who had been drafted into Ngoni regiments but had later revolted, and also hoped to use the Swahili traders and their well-armed guards to protect their southern flank. However, the Swahili preferred to remain on good terms with the Ngoni. The Henga, who were trained soldiers, could not adapt to life as farmers and remained unassimilated into Ngonde society, although they initially prevented Nyakyusa raids.Kalinga (1980), pp. 211-13 After the death of an unusually strong Ngonde Kyungu in 1878 or 1879, his successor was weak and unable to provide firm leadership. In 1885 several powerful men among the Ngonde signed treaties with the African Lakes Company which claimed to cede large areas of land to it without consulting the paramount chief, and one Ngonde faction planned to massacre the Henga without the Kyungu's knowledge. This faction wished to use the African Lakes Company to oppose and possibly replace their paramount chief, who consequently attempted to use the Swahili to strengthen his position. In addition to the internal conflict within the Ngonde state, the Henga leader died in 1887 and his following split into two groups, one led by his son, which represented the warriors, the other included those that had adapted to agricultural life.Kalinga (1980), p. 217 War Although conflict between the Swahili traders their guards and their Henga allies continued with greater or less intensity from mid 1887 to 1895, the accounts of Fotheringham and Lugard, which only record fighting which involved Europeans, identify four distinct periods: in October to December 1887, March 1888, May to August 1888 and February to March 1889. Minor incidents occurred at other times, and the war was formally ended by a treaty on 22 October 1889. Both Fotheringham and Lugard's accounts are written from the British perspective and give no clear indications of the size of the forces employed by the Swahili and their allies or the Ngonde.Kalinga (2012), pp. 7‚Äì8, 33Terry (Part II), pp. 39‚Äì41 Outbreak After the African Lakes Company set up its Karonga trading base, it brokered a settlement between the Ngonde and Nyakyusa, and as the threat of Ngoni raids also declined, the usefulness of Henga and Swahili as buffers was reduced. Both groups were aliens in the Ngonde state and were suspicious of cooperation between the company and the Ngonde, so they allied with each other.Kalinga (1980), pp. 215-6, 218 Fotheringham's own account admits that one of the main sources of the company's problems in 1887 was that it had bought a large quantity of ivory from the ‚ÄúArabs‚Äù on credit, more than could be paid for by a single boat-load of trade goods, and the creditors and their armed followers were forced to wait for several months for satisfaction, expecting the local Ngonde to supply food in the interim. Quarrels between the Swahili traders and the Ngonde people from whom they demanded supplies began in late 1886 and culminated in a violent assault on a trader in July 1887.Fotheringham, pp. 34‚Äì7 This assault was used by Mlozi as the pretext to strike at the Ngonde before they decided that the Swahili were superfluous to their needs. After the killing of a local chief in reprisal, the Swahili, their Ruga-Ruga guards and their Henga allies drove out the Ngonde villagers from the Karonga Plain to a depth of 12 miles from the lake over the next few months and, in October 1887, killed a paramount chief or king of the Ngonde.Fotheringham, pp. 36-7, 45 Although Mlozi was careful not to antagonise the Europeans directly, after this attack he proclaimed himself Sultan of Nkonde and demanded tribute from the African Lakes Company in October 1887, although did not attack when this was refused.Terry (Part I), p. 57 The Ngonde sought protection from the African Lakes Company, which was initially refused. However, after further fighting in which the Ngonde were defeated and their paramount chief's village was sacked, many fled to Karonga, where they were given shelter in the African Lakes Company's compound. Fotheringham claimed that the Swahili wished to drive the Ngonde from their homeland and replace them with the Henga mercenaries they had recruited, and that they also intended to attack Karonga, so he issued arms to company employees and strengthened Karonga's defences.Fotheringham, pp. 51, 61-3McCracken (2012), p. 52 Fotheringham also feared that the advance of the Swahili would jeopardize the company's independent position and reduce it to dependence on Mlozi. Although it was portrayed as a fight against slavery, it was as much a trade war.McCraken (1977), pp. 139 The first periods of fighting The small African Lakes Company presence at Karonga consisted of Fotheringham, his assistant and about 60 African company workers: they had had few firearms and little ammunition. Fotheringham appealed to the African Lakes Company headquarters in Blantyre for assistance, and the British Consul at Mozambique, O'Neill, who normal area of consular authority did not include the Karonga area but acting on behalf of Hawes, the absent Consul to the Lake Region, organised a relief expedition. On 4 November, O'Neill reached Karonga by lake- steamer with three other Europeans. After some weeks of stand-off, Mlozi's men made several armed attacks between 23 and 28 November but were beaten off and retired.Lugard, p. 55 However, O'Neill and Fotheringham abandoned Karonga as too difficult to defend, and sought shelter with a group of Nyakyusa north of the Songwe River, where they were later reinforced by a small group which Hawes, Consul to the Lake Region, back from leave, had brought by a steamer which also carried arms and ammunition. On 23 December 1887, the company force with its Nyakyusa and Ngonde allies attacked Mlozi's headquarters, resulting in an indecisive skirmish, after which the majority of Europeans returned to the south.Terry (Part I), pp. 58-60 There followed a dispute between the two consuls, Hawes wishing to discontinue the armed conflict while O'Neill wanted to attack Mlozi again. As a result, O'Neill returned to Mozambique, but Hawes also quarrelled with John Moir, the African Lakes Company's representative in Blantyre who was supported by most of the European settlers that settlement. O'Neill departed on leave after appointing John Buchanan as Acting Consul. Hawes was later reassigned to Zanzibar and Buchanan remained in post until Henry Hamilton Johnston arrived in March 1889Terry (Part I), pp. 61-3 Frederick Moir, John's brother took a small party of armed men north, arriving at the abandoned site of Karonga on 3 March 1888; Buchanan arrived a few days later, and met Mlozi and other Swahili leaders with the aim of negotiating a settlement on 20 March. The Swahili apparently agreed to evacuate the Ngonde country and destroy their stockades, but later declined to sign an agreement to that effect, so Buchanan left. Meanwhile, Frederick Moir and Fotheringham, manager of the Karonga depot, had recruited some 500 African fighters, 270 with firearms, and rebuilt the Karonga stockade, after which they launched an abortive attack on a Swahili-controlled village in which Moir was severely woundedTerry (Part I), pp. 63-5 Lugard‚Äôs arrival In May 1888, Captain Lugard of the Indian Army, later Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard arrived in Blantyre, having earlier met O‚ÄôNeill in Mozambique. O‚ÄôNeill had told him that the forces at Karonga needed a competent commander. When he reached Blantyre he told Buchanan that, in his opinion, immediate military action against Mlozi and his followers was necessary to protect the missions and the Ngonde people, and to prevent other Swahili traders who had not previously supported Mlozi from joining forces with him, However, Buchanan declined to give him official support in view of Hawes‚Äô opposition and the wish of the British government to avoid involvement.Lugard, pp. 48-9 Although Buchanan, and later the Foreign Office and War Office, gave Lugard no official support, they did not oppose his actions on the basis that they were ostensibly to protect the missions rather than the African Lakes Company.Terry (Part I), pp. 68-71 Lugard left Blantyre in mid-May 1888 and, with around 20 Europeans including John Moir and six other company employees, travelled up Lake Malawi by steamer, pausing at Bandawe to recruit 200 Tonga as soldiers, who were to march to KarongaLugard, pp. 66-7 His first aim was to attack Mlozi's stockade at Chilumba, where slaves and ivory were ferried across the lake. This was captured in a surprise attack and destroyed, after which the steamer continued to Karonga, arriving on 28 May, to reinforce the African Lakes Company employees and numerous Ngonde refugees in the company stockade, which Lugard strengthened and extended.Lugard, p. 66‚Äì67Terry (Part I), pp. 74‚Äì75 After the arrival of the Tonga troops, Lugard prepared to attack the Swahili stockades. His attack, on 16 June, failed after he was wounded, and most of the expedition withdrew in August, leaving a small party in Karonga.Lugard, p. 111‚Äì17Terry (Part II), pp. 20-3, 28 Although several of the missions with interests in the area around Lake Malawi petitioned the British government to declare a protectorate and send troops, Lord Salisbury declined to do so, but agreed that the African Lakes Company and the missions were entitled to defend themselves.Terry (Part II), p. 30 Lugard‚Äôs second expedition Lugard returned to Karonga in October and, on 28 November, he there met an envoy of Sultan of Zanzibar, Khalifa bin Said, who claimed suzerainty over Swahili communities in East and Central Africa. The envoy failed to convince Mlozi and his associates to reach a settlement and, in December, hostilities resumed with a Swahili attack on the Chilumba stockade, which Lugard had repaired and garrisoned the previous month.Terry (Part II), pp. 31-3 This attack failed and Lugard decided to ensure that Mlozi evacuated his strongholds or to force him out of them. On 16 January 1889, he took delivery of a 7-pounder gun and gave Mlozi an ultimatum to depart by 31 January.Lugard, p. 135‚Äì36 After the ultimatum expired, Lugard, with a force of nine Europeans armed with rifles, around 250 Africans, most armed with antiquated muskets, and the gun, attacked one Swahili stockade on 14 February and another on 13 March. Although the field gun caused casualties, its shells did not destroy either stockade. Shortly after the second failure, Lugard left Karonga for Blantyre, which he left on 9 April, arriving at Zanzibar on 3 May 1889 en route to Britain. Six European African Lakes Company employees and an unknown number of armed Africans remained in Karonga, and there was stalemate as neither the company nor the Swahili traders could expel the other.Terry (Part II), pp. 31‚Äì33 The company's failure to expel Mlozi and the other hostile traders put an end to its political claims to become a chartered company with a protectorate over this area. Treaty and aftermath Lugard never returned to Nyasaland but his activities put pressure on the British government to intervene and, in November 1888, it appointed Harry Johnston as Consul in Mozambique, with an area of consular authority covering Central Africa as well as the Portuguese controlled coast.Terry (Part II), p. 39 Johnston arrived at Blantyre in March 1889: at that time he had no significant military forces, and agreed a truce with Mlozi in October 1889 to avoid confrontation with him and other slave traders in the north.McCracken (2012), pp. 57-8 However, despite the provisions in the truce agreement for the Swahili to allow the Ngonde to return to their villages unmolested and to reduce the number of their stockades, Buchanan, who visited Karonga in March 1891 and met Mlozi, reported to Johnston that, rather than expelled Ngonde being allowed to return, others were still being forced out of their homes, and the Swahili traders were building more fortified villages and restricting the African Lakes Company's trading activities.Terry (Part II), pp. 41-3 Although on the formation of the British Central Africa Protectorate in 1891, Johnston was provided with a small force of Indian troops and trained more African soldiers over the next few years, he was fully engaged in the south of the protectorate until 1894. Between 1891 and 1894, Mlozi and his Henga allies had made further attacks on the Ngonde people and, the African Lakes Company claimed, threatened to attack Karonga again. Mlozi refused either to meet Johnston, who visited Karonga in June 1895, or curtail his raiding activities, so Johnston decided on military action.Terry (Part II), pp. 43-4 Johnston first secured the neutrality of the Swahili ruler of Nkhotakota by paying him a subsidy and prepared to attack the Mlozi and the so-called ‚Äúnorth end Arabs‚Äù. In November 1895, he embarked a force of over 400 Sikh and African riflemen, with artillery and machine guns on steamers at Mangochi, bound for Karonga. Without any prior warning, he assaulted two smaller stockades on 2 December and, on the same day, surrounded Mlozi's large, double-fenced stockaded town, bombarding it for two days and finally assaulting it on 4 December, facing stiff resistance. Mlozi was captured, given a cursory trial and hanged on 5 December. Between 200 and 300 of Mlozi's fighters were killed, many while attempting to surrender, and several hundred non-combatants were also killed in the bombardment. The other Swahili stockades did not resist and were destroyedJ McCracken (2012), pp. 61-3 The Karonga War was minor in terms of combatants and casualties compared to the First or Second Matabele War in Southern Rhodesia but it had major significance for the history of Malawi, particularly the north of the country, because it forced a change in British government policy. This had originally been to ensure that no other power controlled the area west and south of Lake Malawi, but without Britain assuming any sovereignty over that area. It changed to one where Britain felt it necessary to proclaim a protectorate.Kalinga (2012), p. 33 Like the roughly contemporaneous Abushiri revolt in German East Africa, the war represented the end of the political influence of Swahili traders acknowledging the Sultan of Zanzibar's authority in East and Central Africa, and the end of attempts of Chartered companies to assume or retain control in place of their home governments.Pouwels, pp. 130-2  References  Further reading *M.

The nobles divided territories between themselves but soon started fighting between themselves for supremacy. One noble invited the Mughal emperor Akbar to intervene in 1572 which resulted in the conquest of Gujarat by 1573 and Gujarat becoming the province of the Mughal Empire. Background The Battle of Sarnal, 1572, Akbarnama The last two Gujarat Sultans, Ahmad Shah III and Mahmud Shah III, were raised to the throne when they were young. So the nobles had decided to carry on the government under one noble as a regent of the Sultan and they further divided the country among themselves, each one undertaking to protect the frontiers and preserve the public peace. They protected the Sultanate from outside threats such as Mub√°rak Sh√°h, the ruler of Khandesh. But the nobles had their own aspirations so started looking for opportunity to expand their territories with intention of the supremacy. They continued to fight among themselves and occasionally invited neighbouring countries and powers in the conflict. During one such instance, Khandesh gained Dultanpur and Nandubar from nobles for not invading Gujarat. On another occasion, one noble Chang√≠z Kh√°n had attacked Surat to take vengeance for his father‚Äôs death and took help from the Portuguese who gained districts of Daman and Sanjan in return. One noble Itimad Khan, with view of becoming independent and supreme, continued to engage in power struggle with other nobles. When some nobles laid siege to Ahmedabad to drive out Itimad Khan, he turned for help to the powerful Mughal emperor Akbar ruling from Delhi. Akbar, glad of any pretext for driving the rebel M√≠rz√°s who had previously been driven out of India by Akbar, from their place of refuge in Southern Gujar√°t, was not slow in availing himself of √çtim√°d Kh√°n‚Äôs proposal. On 2 July 1572, he started for √Åhmed√°b√°d from his capital at Fatehpur Sikri. Conquest of Gujarat To the nobles thus fighting among themselves, news was brought that the emperor Akbar was at Disa. Ibr√°h√≠m Husain M√≠rza returned to Bharuch and the army of the noble Faul√°dis of Patan dispersed which resulted in end of the siege of Ahmedabad. From Disa, the Mughal troops advanced to P√°tan and then to Jot√°na, thirty miles south of P√°tan. Gujarat Sult√°n Muzaffar Shah III, who had separated from the Faul√°dis of Patan, fell into the hands of the emperor, who granted him his life but placed him under charge of one of his nobles named Karam √Åli. When the Mughal army reached Kadi, the nobles; √çtim√°d Kh√°n, Ikhtiy√°r Kh√°n, √Ålaf Kh√°n, and Jhujh√°r Kh√°n; met Akbar and another noble Sayad H√°mid also was honoured with an audience at H√°jipur. The emperor imprisoned opposing nobles, √Ålaf Kh√°n and Jhujh√°r Kh√°n Habshi, and encouraged the other Gujar√°t nobles. One noble Ikhtiy√°r-ul-Mulk now fled to Lunawada, and the emperor, fearing that others of the Gujar√°t nobles might follow his example, sent √çtim√°d Kh√°n to Khambhat and placed him under the charge of Shahb√°z Kh√°n Kambo. From √Åhmed√°b√°d, Akbar advanced to Khambhat. At this time Ibr√°h√≠m M√≠rza held Baroda, Muhammad Husain M√≠rza held Surat, and Sh√°h M√≠rza held Champaner. On leaving Khambaht to expel the M√≠rzas, Akbar appointed M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh his first viceroy of Gujar√°t. Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri was built by Akbar in 1575 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat At Baroda, Akbar heard that Ibr√°h√≠m M√≠rza had treacherously killed Rustam Kh√°n R√∫mi, who was Chang√≠z Kh√°n‚Äôs governor of Bharuch. The emperor recalled the detachment he had sent against Surat, and overtaking the M√≠rza at Sarn√°l or Th√°sra on the right bank of the Mahi river about twenty-three miles north-east of Nadiad, after a bloody conflict routed him. The M√≠rza fled by Ahmednagar to Sirohi, and Akbar rejoined his camp at Baroda. The emperor now sent a force under Sh√°h Kuli Kh√°n to invest the fort of Surat, and following in person pitched his camp at Gopi Talav, a suburb of that city. After an obstinate defence of one month and seventeen days, the garrison under Hamzab√°n, a slave of Hum√°y√∫n‚Äôs who had joined the M√≠rz√°s, surrendered. Hamzab√°n was in treaty with the Portuguese. Under his invitation a large party of Portuguese came to Surat during the siege, but seeing the strength of the Mughal army, represented themselves as ambassadors and besought the honour of an interview. While at Surat, the emperor received from Bih√°r or Vih√°rji the R√°ja of Baglan, Sharfudd√≠n Husain M√≠rza whom the R√°ja had captured. After the capture of Surat, the emperor ordered the great Sulaim√°ni cannon which had been brought by the Turks with the view of destroying the Portuguese forts and left by them in Surat, to be taken to Agra. Surat was placed in the charge of Kal√≠j Kh√°n. The emperor now advanced to √Åhmed√°b√°d, where the mother of Chang√≠z Kh√°n came and demanded justice on Jhujh√°r Kh√°n for having wantonly slain her son. As her complaint was just, the emperor ordered Jhujh√°r Kh√°n to be thrown under the feet of an elephant. Muhammad Kh√°n, son of Sher Kh√°n Faul√°di, who had fled to the Idar hills, now returned and took the city of P√°tan, besieging the Mughal governor, Sayad √Åhmed Kh√°n B√°rha, in the citadel. At this time M√≠rza Muhammad Husain was at Ranpur near Dhandhuka. When Sher Kh√°n Faul√°di, who had taken refuge in Sorath, heard of Muhammad Kh√°n‚Äôs return to P√°tan, he met M√≠rza Muhammad Husain, and uniting their forces they joined Muhammad Kh√°n at P√°tan. The viceroy M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh with other nobles marched against them, and after a hard-fought battle, in which several of the Mughal nobles were slain, M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh was victorious. Sher Kh√°n again took refuge in Sorath, and his son fled for safety to the √çdar hills, while the M√≠rza withdrew to the Kh√°ndesh frontier. As the conquest of Gujar√°t was completed in 1573, Akbar returned to Agra with the last Gujarat Sult√°n Muzaffar Shah III as a captive. Akbar built Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri in 1575 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat.Encyclopaedia Britannica. Fatehpur Sikri  Aftermath  Muzaffar Shah III escaped from the captivity and took asylum under Jam Sataji of Nawanagar in Kathiawar region. The battle to save him was fought in July 1591 (Vikram Samvat 1648). The Kathiawar army included the armies of Junagadh and Kundla who betrayed Nawanagar and joined the Mughal army at last. The battle led to large number of casualty on both sides. The battle resulted in the decisive victory of Mughal army and Gujarat finally and completely fell under Mughal empire.

In its first phase, IBL members are recording 100,000's of neurons across virtually all brain structures in mice performing the very same decision. IBL was officially launched in September 2017 thanks to a $10 million grant from Simons Foundation and a ¬£10 million grant from the Wellcome Trust. The first major scientific milestones for the project are the development of an open source data architecture for large scale neuroscience collaboration and the replication of the behavior across all experimental labs. In late 2019, the IBL released the behavioral data, containing close to 3 million mouse choices. The subsequent milestone involves the assembly of a brain-wide map of activity. This map of activity is being obtained with Neuropixels probes, which allow recording up to 300-1000 neurons simultaneously. Other recording technologies, such as calcium imaging, will be used in the second phase. These data will then be analyzed and integrated to produce the brain-wide model of decision making.  Origin  IBL was founded in 2016 by Zachary Mainen (Champalimaud Center of the Unknown), Michael Hausser (University College London), and Alexandre Pouget (University of Geneva). These scientists argued in a paper published the same year that, given the complexity of the questions in neuroscience and the scale of the technical challenge, it seems unlikely that the research performed by individual labs will be sufficient to understand how the brain works. Inspired by the remarkable success of large scale collaborations in physics such as CERN or LIGO, they proposed creating similar focused collaborations in neuroscience based on several core principles: # A shared ambitious, yet realistic, goal (e.g. a brain-wide model of decision making in a single species), # Tight coordination between theorists and experimentalists. # Standardization of the behavioral tasks, hardware and data analysis to ensure reproducibility and allowing pooling of data, # Open access to data and resources within and outside the collaboration, and # A relatively flat hierarchy and a collaborative decision- making process. These principles are at the heart of the IBL collaboration.

This has led to increased tensions in Hong Kong society, due to the interpretations of freedom of speech of certain content of the posters. This has also led to copycats incidents occurring in other universities in Hong Kong as well reigniting Hong Kong Independence debate within Hong Kong Kong society. The standoff, which has manifested in a series of protests and counterprotests on campuses, is reflective of the wider disconnect between mainlanders and Hongkongers, fanned by a host of reasons from politics and language barriers to state-fuelled propaganda and competition for scarce resources. Background Rise of Localism in Hong Kong Since the end of 2014 Hong Kong Protests and the failure of 2014‚Äì15 Hong Kong electoral reform, led to changes to new political changes within Hong Kong society. Public dissatisfaction (among Hong Kong Youth) with Pro-democracy camp for their lack of progress in introducing democracy and the Pro-Beijing camp for not looking out for Hong Kong's interests, led to new \\"localist\\" parties being formed to challenge the status quo. Localism has been gaining popularity within Hong Kong youth, some rejecting their identity as \\"Chinese\\", with many new political parties and organisations, with different interpretations, some Localist parties have promoted a \\"Hong Kong first\\" agenda, while others promote the notion of Hong Kong Independence, believing that only when Hong Kong is Independent from Mainland China, Hong Kong can reach its true potential. Student activism Universities in Hong Kong, have always had a strong pretense in Student activism, with involvement in many different causes as well responding to certain events and policies throughout the years, with Hong Kong Federation of Students being the main organisation. Examples include Cultural Revolution, Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands, 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Hong Kong 1 July marches, Moral and national education protests, 2013 Hong Kong dock strike, 2014 Hong Kong protests. There has been divide between Hong Kong students and Mainland students in Hong Kong, due differences in their cultural upbringing. There are two distinct types of Mainland students, undergraduates and postgraduates. Mainland students who are undergraduates in Hong Kong universities, tend to understand the context of such problems and be bit more sympathetic in their responses as they do mingle more with Hong Kong local students. Then there are Mainland students who are one-year postgraduates, have little time to gain deep knowledge and understanding of Hong Kong and few of them will become proficient in Cantonese as most of them fresh out of university in the mainland. Hence most will be patriotic and nationalistic and most of their friend groups will be fellow Mainlanders. Hong Kong-Mainland China Conflict Xinqi Su, writing for South China Morning Post explains that \\"Tainted baby milk formula imported from the mainland, mainland mothers flooding city hospitals in a bid to give their children residency rights, tax breaks for mainland traders, the so-called ‚Äúanti-locust‚Äù protests against mainland visitors, failed political reforms and, most recently, disqualification of pan-democratic lawmakers with Beijing's new interpretation of the Basic Law, have all worked to create a sense of mistrust.\\" Both sides have poor connections/bridges between the two as well different communication. For example differences can be seen on social media, where there are ‚Äútwo echo chambers‚Äù, Mainland students tend to use QQ, Weibo and WeChat, while Hong Kong students tend to use Facebook and Instagram, thus deepened the segregation as well languages use, Mandarin for Mainland students and Cantonese for local students. In an editorial, South China Morning Post explained \\"Pro-independence banners appeared across the city‚Äôs higher education institutes on the National Day in 2016. Provocative and unwise as they are, the gestures are unsurprising, though. They stem from the negative sentiments arising from what some see as an erosion of the city‚Äôs high degree of autonomy, the setback over political reform and the unlawful Occupy protests in 2014. The sentiments became even stronger after a court ruled in favour of the government‚Äôs bid to throw three former student activists behind bars.\\" Timeline Week 1 =September 4= A series of banners and posters displaying the messages related to \\"Hong Kong Independence\\" sprung up around the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Nobody claimed responsibility for the acts, it is believed that they put by some unknown CUHK students, the banners and posters were later taken down. As the posters were taken down, the CUHK student union condemned the act as \\"suppression of freedom of speech\\", however university argued that the banners were hung at several spots on campus without any prior permission, hence were removed. The chair of the university's student union, Justin Au, admitted that he and other some activists had wrapped a banner, covered with the names of Pro-democracy activists jailed or facing prosecution such as Joshua Wong Chi- fung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Alex Chow Yong-kang, around the Goddess of Democracy statue at the campus. =September 5 (First standoff)= On Tuesday, three more 'Hong Kong Independence' banners appeared around CUHK. The university responded by accusing the CUHK student union for not enforcing rules, issuing a letter the union stating \\"We have noted the posters and banners advocating Hong Kong independence. Such ideas have constituted a breach of relevant provisions of the law, and go against the university‚Äôs stance of absolute disagreement to independence\\". The union responded with encouraging students to stand up for the right to defend free speech, warning the university plans to remove the banners by force. Lee Chen-yung, vice chairperson of the Students Association, and 20 other students decided to protect the banner after being told that it was going to be removed later that day. Later that evening, a standoff (captured on video), occurred between a Mainland female student and representatives from CUSU at Democracy wall as the student attempted to take down Independence posters (‚ÄúFight for our homeland. Fight for Hong Kong independence‚Äù). She left after being told she could post messages expressing her disagreement, she could not remove existing signage. Similar pro-independence banners and solidarity messages for CUHK appeared in various places including the democracy wall in Hong Kong University (HKU) and Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK). EdUHKSU reported that the banner disappeared less than an hour after being put up. It also stopped a Putonghua- speaking woman from taking down and destroying the banner, but that she had subsequently left the scene. The union issued a statement \\"We denounce the woman‚Äôs actions. Students have the right to express their opinions, but even if they do not agree, to destroy others‚Äô property due to a difference in political opinion is barbaric\\". =September 6 (First joint statement)= More pro-independence and solidarity with CUSU banners and posters has spread and appeared in City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Shue Yan University. Some were put up by the student unions, while others were done anonymous students. The unions from City University, Hang Seng Management College, Lingnan University, Polytechnic University, Education University, Open University and Chinese University issued a joint open letter condemning the removal of such material by campus authorities as a 'serious erosion' of academic freedom. Independence posters in Chinese University, City University, Hong Kong Polytechnic and Education University were later removed at night. The Universities of Education and City cited 'advocating illegal action' and 'violation of the Basic Law' as reasons for the removal. The four respective student unions slammed the removal as 'intervening in the students right to freedom of speech'. =September 7 (Second Standoff/First offensive poster about 'congratulating' death/First public protest)= Despite the removal of Independence posters and banners, more reappeared, with messages also appearing in Hong Kong Baptist University and the rest of universities in Hong Kong. The mainland Chinese student captured on film on September 5 tearing down posters advocating Hong Kong independence has been called a hero by Communist Youth League. On social media, she was widely praised on Mainland China, while she widely condemned in Hong Kong. At 5pm, a group of middle-aged pro-Beijing protesters also showed up condemning the CUHK student union and urging the university management to remove all the offensive posters. At 6pm, another standoff occurred at CUHK's democracy wall between 100 Hong Kong students and Mainland students, with heated scattered quarrels broke out for completing space to put up posters and taking opposing ideological stands on freedom of speech. Posters declaring ‚ÄúCUSU is not CU‚Äù, ‚ÄúSorry we refuse to be represented‚Äù , ‚ÄúGet out of Chinese soil if supporting independence‚Äù, \\"We don't want the anthem law\\" and many others appeared. The standoff lasted for an hour, before both groups dispersed. CUSU leader, Au Tsz-Ho said ‚ÄúWe respect opposing opinions of students and will safeguard freedom of speech,‚Äù and the union agreed to clear three out of four boards of pro-independence posters, stating they would remove all such material without signatures as posters without signatures breached regulations. Shue Yan University also said posters could stay up on its democracy as long as space was also provided for other views. An offensive post was seen on the democracy wall of the Education University of Hong Kong, after news of the death of Poon Hong-yan, a son of Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin was reported. =September 8 (Second public protest)= Chinese University of Hong Kong said that it will investigate a student, who was later identified as former student union leader Ernie Chow for allegedly using derogatory language (the word ‚ÄúChee-na‚Äù), after receiving multiple internal and external complaints. The incident occurred during a standoff with mainland students over banners advocating independence at Democracy wall, on September 7. The university issued a statement: ‚ÄúThe university strongly condemns the student‚Äôs use of a derogatory slur against China to engage malicious personal attacks.\\" At around 2.30pm, about 30 members of the student unions of Chinese University, the University of Hong Kong, Baptist University and Shue Yan University held a protest outside the Chinese University's student affairs office demanding a dialogue. They demanded protection for freedom of speech, regardless of differing political stances and a promise that banners or posters would not be taken down. At around 8.30pm, the university vice-president Dennis Ng Kee-pui agreed not to take any posters or banners down without talking to the students. A poster \\"congratulating\\" Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin on her son, Peter Poon \\"going to heaven\\" appearing on Education University, received widespread condemnation. The Education University president, Stephen Cheung Yan-leung said he was angry and upset over the posters, and two people have been captured on surveillance cameras with the university trying to identify the perpetrators. A disciplinary committee will decide the seriousness of the offense if they are students. Education University council chairman Frederick Ma Si-hang remarked ‚ÄúI would like to ask everyone in Hong Kong to answer one question: if they were parents, would they want their children to be educated by the two young persons?‚Äù Carrie Lam issued a statement saying ‚ÄúI deeply regret and condemn such behaviour. The remarks are entirely disrespectful, against the moral values of society and cold-blooded. The whole community are shocked, grieved, and enraged by the appearance of such remarks in a tertiary institution in Hong Kong.‚Äù Activists from around 40 groups demonstrated outside a library at Education University to protest over a poster that appeared to mock the death of a government official's son. The protesters demanded that university officials punish those responsible for the poster if they are found to be students there. The Education University student union leader, Lala Lai Hiu-Ching said the poster was removed soon after as insults, personal attacks and libel are forbidden on the democracy wall. The union stated ‚ÄúThe student union will not condemn the remarks because freedom of speech and respect for others are both important.‚Äù Student union leaders from University of Hong Kong, Baptist University, Chinese University, Shue Yan University and City University made similar remarks. Lala Lai Hiu-Ching warned of serious consequences if the university tracks down and punishes the people who put up a controversial poster, as it creates 'white terror'. =September 9 (Second offensive poster about 'congratulating' death)= Posters mocking the death of the son of Choi appeared at City University of Hong Kong's democracy wall overnight. CityU's student union took down the posters as the wordings were deemed to insulting. An offensive poster mocking the death of mainland dissent, Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, and the detention of his wife appeared at the Education University of Hong Kong's Democracy wall. The latest poster, written in simplified Chinese characters, read: \\"Congratulate rebel Liu Xiaobo has died. Celebrate Liu Xia being under house arrest by our party forever.\\" It was later taken down by the student union. The university's management condemned the latest incident and said CCTV footage would be reviewed and the culprits identified, and if necessary seek police help. Rumours have surfaced that Education University students have lost their internships and potential graduate jobs due a banner \\"congratulating\\" the death of a top education official's son appearing at the campus. =September 10 (Second joint statement)= Prof. Henry Wong Nai-ching, who heads New Asia College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Senate Committee on Student Discipline have launched an investigation against Ernie Chow Shue-fung, a former head of the school's student union for using offensive languages against some mainlanders during a standoff on September 7. In response, the student union accused Wong of violating the university's rules on disciplinary probes, saying that he had openly declared Chow guilty even before a trial was held, thus threatening Chow's personal safety. Ernie Chow Shue-fung said that he is very disappointed at both the college and the university, saying he was the one who suffered open humiliation and some Mainlanders at the standoff also hurled insults CCTV footage showing two alleged suspects behind the poster against Choi and two people wearing caps and hoodie behind the poster against Liu Xiaobo were leaked to the public. A joint statement issued by the student unions of 13 tertiary education institutions accused the government of ‚Äúexerting pressure on university authorities to punish those whose speech may have intimidated the people in power. Universities are where thoughts and opinions are exchanged, and democracy walls are platforms for students to speak their minds. The regime is now making an explicit effort to limit our freedom of expression,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWhile such slogans are inappropriate, we also find them excusable.Student unions condemn the authorities of EdU for creating white terror and request the authorities give a proper response regarding the leak of the CCTV footage.‚Äù Week 2 =September 11 (Third joint statement)= The president of the Education University, Stephen Cheung said that even if the perpetrators behind offensive posters are found to be students at the institution, he will not report them to police, rather he will let the institution's disciplinary committee deal with them. The university has informed the Privacy Commissioner about the leakage of CCTV footage and will also look at whether better procedures can be adopted to prevent such leaks in the future. EdU council chair Frederick Ma Si-hang responded to backlash that EDU students have been blacklisted from potential employment opportunities, stating that these were isolated incidents and that should not implicate other students, the education sector shouldn't perceive that there are problems with all students at this university and promised to communicate with the education sector. He also urged lawmakers not to pressure school authorities over the issue of Hong Kong Independence banners and posters. Tsoi Pui- keung, a pro-independence advocate and Hong Kong National Party supporter had admitted putting up a notice at City University mocking Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin after she lost her son and challenging the authorities to arrest him. All 39 pro-Beijing Legislative Council members have submitted a joint petition to Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, urging the government and university authorities to implement policies to prevent similar incidents from occurring and to issue a ban on material advocating independence. They also issued a statement saying ‚ÄúIt is indisputable that Hong Kong independence violates the Basic Law. Opposing Hong Kong independence is the wish of the general public, and society is concerned that if this incident continues, there will be a negative effect on universities and even the whole of society.‚Äù A group of district councillors from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong filed a report at the police headquarters in Wan Chai urging the police to enforce the law for those who put up Independence banners on university campuses. A man was seen tearing down posters at Lingnan University of Hong Kong. The posters said that people should respect others‚Äô freedom of speech, even if they do not support Hong Kong independence. A student took photographs of the incident and reported it to the police. The police said they are handling the case as criminal damage and no-one yet been arrested. =September 12 (Third public protest)= Several groups, including the Hong Kong Youth Against Independence, have staged protests outside the High Court and the Police Headquarters, demanding the police take action against people putting up pro-independence banners on university campuses. They said the banners are a violation of the Basic Law and the Crimes Ordinance and separatism calls have crossed the line of academic freedom and freedom of speech The student union of Shue Yan University reported that pro- independence posters on its student noticeboard had been removed in the morning, nobody claimed responsibility. =September 13 (Fourth public protest)= Student union vice-president of Lingnan university Issac Chan Tsun-hin said anonymous posters bearing the words ‚ÄúHong Kong independence‚Äù appeared on the democracy wall last week but later mysteriously removed. Posters supporting 'Hunan Independence' were seen at Lingnan's Democracy wall with the late Communist leader Mao Zedong declaring his home province in mainland China, must become an independent state. At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a dozen student union members staged a protest demanding an open dialogue with the management, while holding a banner stating: \\"The management should stop hiding and offer us an explanation. Defend our campus against dictatorial rule.\\" They were unhappy with the removal of posters bearing the words ‚ÄúHong Kong independence‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo guilt to advocate Hong Kong independence‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSupport Chinese University students‚Äù. PolyU management replied, saying: ‚ÄúTo respect and observe the Basic Law, we do not support Hong Kong independence. Based on the same principle, the management of PolyU will remove all related slogans and publicity materials on campus. The removal of such items was meant to protect students from potentially breaking the law‚Äù. =September 14 (Third offensive poster about 'congratulating' death)= Tang Lipei, a Mainland student in Chinese University of Hong Kong, was accused of being a traitor and separatist by Mainland media and netizens after defending freedom of speech in Hong Kong and not praising the Mainland girl who was involved in a democracy wall standoff on September 5. He was forced to apologise publicly twice and pledge allegiance to People's Republic of China. He also contacted a lawyer over a possible lawsuit against those who called him a separatist or a treasonous person. Pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho announced he will organize a rally at Admiralty on September 17, to protest against independence advocacy & Professor Benny Tai as well as \\"cold-blooded\\" messages mocking the suicide of the eldest son of cation Christine Choi Yuk- lin appearing in universities. He expects around 2000 people will turn up to show their support. A poster \\"celebrating\\" the 16th anniversary of the September 11 attacks appeared at University of Hong Kong's Democracy wall. The HKU students' union, which said it did not agree with the poster's message, but would leave it alone to respect freedom of speech. =September 15 (Fourth joint statement)= Chinese University president Joseph Sung, demanded the student union to remove materials advocating Hong Kong independence and if the student union doesn't remove the materials from areas of the campus it manages, staff officials will tear down the banners and posters. The Student union president Justin Au Tsz-hoIf responded ‚Äúthe school tries to remove the banners by force, we will spare no effort to protect students‚Äô right of expression. We strongly condemn the university for refusing to communicate with students. Sung is conducting self-censorship in the school, reducing himself to a political pawn.‚Äù In a joint statement, the ten university heads in Hong Kong stated ‚ÄúWe treasure freedom of expression, but we condemn its recent abuses. Freedom of expression is not absolute, and like all freedoms it comes with responsibilities. All universities undersigned agree that we do not support Hong Kong independence, which contravenes the Basic Law.‚Äù Timothy O‚ÄôLeary, the head of the University of Hong Kong's School of Humanities and head of concern group HKU Vigilance, questioned the statement asking ‚ÄúIt would have been nice to know what argument they have for the banners being an ‚Äòabuse‚Äô of freedom of expression.‚Äù =September 16 (Fifth joint statement)= In response to the September 15th joint statement from 10 university heads, the student unions of 12 Hong Kong universities issued their own statement: ‚ÄúWe treasure freedom of expression, which is the right that we are born with. The universities do not support Hong Kong independence, but teachers and students still enjoy the freedom of speech to discuss Hong Kong independence. All students‚Äô unions undersigned agree that discussion on Hong Kong independence is protected under Article 27 of the Basic Law. We urge the universities to stop misleading the public.‚Äù =September 17 (Third Standoff/Fifth public protest)= Another standoff occurred at CUHK's democracy wall. Lee Man-yiu, external affairs secretary of the university‚Äôs student union, confronted a few people tearing down pro- independence posters around 1.30pm, they quickly left in a car, calling Lee a \\"British traitor\\" while Lee pasted the posters back up. About an hour later, around 10 middle aged to elderly members from pro-Beijing group Caring Hong Kong Power, led by Lee Ka-Ka, returned threatened to tear down independence- themed posters. Lee called more students and security guards to maintain order. Quarrels took place between the student union members and the pro- Beijing group, with scuffles between security and Caring Hong Kong Power members as the latter put up their \\"This place is China\\" posters on the democracy wall. Police were later called by CUHK management to assist in the standoff, they arrived at 5pm, but nobody was arrested. Both groups stood off against each other with pro and anti-Independence posters still on the democracy wall, with Caring Hong Kong Power chanting \\"Hong Kong is China\\" after few hours they left. Around 2100-4000 people turned up a protest rally in Tamar Park, organised by Junius Ho. He with other prominent Pro-Beijing figures such as Holden Chow, Tsang Shu-wo, Hau Chi-keung, Ben Chan, Peter Shiu and Chris Wat, and the protesters called HKU to fire Benny Tai, claiming he is responsible for growing calls for Hong Kong independence.Hau Chi-keung During the rally, Junius Ho publicly called for killing of people who support Hong Kong Independence. Week 3 =September 18 (Sixth joint statement)= The Lingnan University Student Union says it is ready to protect freedom of speech by assisting other universities if anyone forcefully removes Hong Kong independence banners. The 22 pro-democracy lawmakers issued a joint statement condemning Junius Ho‚Äôs remarks on September 17th. ‚ÄúHo, as a legislator and lawyer, expressed hate speech involving murder at a public event, crossing the bottom lines of free speech and morality and severely breaching professional conduct.‚Äù The statement also cited sections 17B and 26 of the Public Order Ordinance, which respectively criminalise causing disorder in public places and proposing violence at public gatherings, and urge the police and Department of Justice to take action. Ronny Tong also believes that Ho may broken the law citing Public Order Ordinance. Benny Tai said that publicly calling for other people's deaths had crossed the bottom line of freedom of speech. Secretary for Justice, Rimsky Yuen responded that they will look at Ho's call 'to kill' to see if it broke any law. Ho responded by saying \\"What is wrong with killing someone during a war?\\" =September 19= Both Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung and Chief Executive Carrie Lam expressed support for the anti-independence statement jointly issued by the heads of 10 universities on September 15. In response to Junius Ho's public remarks to 'kill', Executive Council member Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, in criticised Julius Ho stating \\"Loving our country does not mean acting or speaking in a stupid way, like Junius Ho yesterday. It will do our country no good to have stupid ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô, including possibly quite a few hired to become ‚Äòpatriots.‚Äô \\" Carrie Lam also criticised Junius Ho, indirectly, stating ‚ÄúHong Kong is a civilised society, we have moral bottom line in a civilised society. Any rude, insulting, threatening speeches cannot be accepted. I urge society to calm down, approve what is right and condemn what is wrong ‚Äì do not push Hong Kong to harm the country‚Äôs sovereign safety, challenge the power of the central government, the authority of the Hong Kong Basic Law, destroy the peacefulness of society, and bring us to boundary of a civilised society.‚Äù Ho responded by claiming that ‚Äúkill‚Äù has multiple meanings. The North District Parallel Imports Concern Group reported Ho's remarks to the Hong Kong Police. At Chinese University, student union representatives were around guarding the banners from the removal threat issued on September 15. The student union also hung a new black banner bearing the words ‚ÄúOppose Article 23 legislation‚Äù. At Lingnan University's Democracy wall, posters bearings the words ‚ÄúSupport Hong Kong Independent Media‚Äù were on display, but the word ‚Äúindependent‚Äù later ripped off. The union vice-president Issac Chan Tsun-hin said he did not think university staff did it. =September 20 (Sixth public protest)= The Privacy Commissioner said that the Education University of Hong Kong had violated data protection principles by enabling the release of CCTV camera footage of two people suspected of putting up an offensive posters on September 10. The university was slammed for failing to take steps to safeguard unauthorized access to personal data, which is a violation of a data security principle under the city's privacy laws, however as violating a data protection principle is not a punishable offence. EdUHK students‚Äô union president Lai Hiu-ching criticized school officials for failing to protect student rights and demanded an apology. Security chief, John Lee, said that the police are looking into threatening comments made by pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho Alex Lo , a columnist for the South China Morning Post, urged Junius Ho to issue a public apology. The Tuen Mun Community Network, has collected over 13,000 signatures demanding Ho resign from the Legislative Council and Tuen Mun District Council. Regina Ip further criticized Junius Ho by saying \\"Should you bite the dog that bites you? Then you also become a dog. People feel the Cultural Revolution is being revived in Hong Kong, Hongkongers dislike this most intensely.\\" Ho responded by saying \\"my purpose is correct\\". Around 40 protesters, including members from Demosisto, the League of Social Democrats and People Power marched from Legco to the Law Society demanding a disciplinary hearing into one of its members, Junius Ho. Prominent Pro- democracy figures Avery Ng, Tam Tak-chi, Claudia Mo, Raymond Chan Chi-chuen, Eddie Chu, Edward Yiu, Leung Kwok-hung, Tiff Yuen, Agnes Chow, and Derek Lam and protesters demanded Ho to publicly apologise and resign from his positions within the legislature, District Council and the governing board of Lingnan University. The protestors said if the authorities fail to take action against Ho for his remarks, the public will be left with the impression that the rich and powerful can get away with anything. Alan Wong Hok-ming, a member of the Progressive Lawyers Group said Ho's controversial remark has perhaps damaged the professional reputation of lawyers as a whole. A freedom of expression concern group, has been established by CUHK students in response to the standoff involving pro-independence banners on university campuses. =September 21= Chinese University's student union took down a controversial pro-independence banner. The union decided to take it down because people hanging the banner didn't used proper procedures for that space. But the union warned it would put up the same banner again if Chinese University failed to hold talks with teachers and students to set out clear rules regarding using the space at the Cultural Square, CUHK said it welcomed the student union's move to remove the banner and that it will continue communicating with the union on the rules regarding Cultural Square. Chinese University student union accused the university of having double standards as it had not called for banner saying ‚ÄòOppose Article 23‚Äô to be removed, while demanding the removal banner 'Hong Kong Independence'. It stated ‚ÄúClearly the school has a double standard ‚Äì everything is political censorship,‚Äù University management has become the regime's puppet ‚Äì freedom of expression will be destroyed.‚Äù It accused the university of creating ‚Äúwhite terror‚Äù by ‚Äúmisleading the public in saying that contravening the constitution is equal to violating criminal laws.‚Äù A pro-Beijing group, The Defend Hong Kong Campaign staged a rally in Wan Chai supporting Junius Ho. They also filed a police report saying Ho allegedly has been bullied online. Junius Ho also reported to the police about allegedly being bullied online. =September 22= Police confirmed they are looking into the case of Junius Ho allegedly being a victim of cyberbullying. Week 4 =September 25= The Hong Kong Polytechnic University admitted that it will continue to tear down pro- independence material on campus, even on the democracy wall (managed by the student union) \\"to prevent students from potentially violating the law.\\" The university's management held talks with members of the student organization, Poly U Pavilion, they discussed the recent removal of material from the \\"democracy wall\\" notice board. The student union accused the university of suppressing free speech. =September 26= In an interview with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, University of Hong Kong vice-chancellor Professor Peter Mathieson made a clarification about the joint statement made on September 15 by 10 local universities. He stated ‚ÄúI have at no time said that discussion of Hong Kong independence is an abuse of freedom of expression. the first part of the joint statement was directed at specific instances of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù, one of which referred to the death of the son of Undersecretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin, and another suggested the anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York should be celebrated. The second part of the statement restated a position that I and other universities have taken before, that as institutional leaders we do not support Hong Kong independence. Sometimes different political camps here exploit the same words or events to mean different things according to their own aims and wishes.‚Äù Aftermath Due to recent media coverage over the standoff at Democracy Wall and removal and reappearance of Independence banners and posters at Hong Kong Universities, students have been posting posters commenting on a range of topics, testing the limits of freedom of speech, some with resulting in harsh condemnations (see timeline above). Some of the other posters content include: Mockery of Liu Xiaobo‚Äôs death, Independence for Hunan, Mao Zedong teachings on democracy and patriotism, Vladivostok reunification and celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Albert Cheng, a political commentator accuses the Hong Kong government of Carrie Lam and her ministers of double standards, when dealing with people of different political views. He notes that they have come down hard on the democrats and independence advocates, however appear to delay or mildly/ indirectly condemn pro-Beijing lawmakers and activists for their 'rogue activities'. If Lam continues with this pro-Beijing tolerance and fails to address and fix the problem in a proper manner, her governance will be doomed. After publicly calling to 'kill' Hong Kong Independence advocates, reports surfaced that Junius Ho reportedly lied about having his legal qualifications in England and Wales and Singapore, as according to the Solicitors Regulation Authority stated that Ho's name does not exist in the authority's record. Kwok Cheuk- kin, known as 'king of judicial reviews' wants the court to disqualify the him from the Legislative Council. Kwok said there might be evidence of electoral fraud by claiming he was a solicitor in Singapore, and England and Wales, when campaigning in the latest Legco election. Junius Ho later admitted using \\"unfortunate choice of words\\" during his September 17 protest rally. The Hong Kong Social Workers General Union said that they would write to The Law Society of Singapore to protest about Ho's fraudulent behaviour and would consider a penalty for his misconduct. The Neo Democrats reported Junius Ho's alleged false statements about his qualifications to the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The ICAC says they are investigating the matter. The pro-democracy camp in Legco, are tabling a motion seeking to censure and impeach pro-Beijing legislator Junius Ho, over his call for the death of independence advocates, they argue that advocated killing and incites violence is already a crime and a breach of his oath of office. Carrie Lam's popularity rating and the level of public confidence in her were at a record low since she became Chief Executive, according to the latest edition of the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme, done from September 12 to 15. Her public confidence plunged 8 percentage points to 7 per cent compared at late August, with an approval rate of about 47 per cent and a disapproval rate of about 41 per cent. Her popularity also dropped by 2.6 marks, to 56.4 out of 100 due to the standoff. Impact The standoff has fuelled fears that freedoms are being squeezed by Beijing, with Hong Kong students accusing their universities of suppressing freedom of speech and that Pro-Beijing camp is expanding its influence in a range of areas, from politics to media and education. Pundits and commentators remarked that this one of Carrie Lam's first tests in dealing with a 'political affair', as she has to convince central leaders not to overreact to the independence banners, prevent large scale political stifle and assuring Hong Kong population that their freedom of speech is protected. SC Yeung writing for Eiinsight, remarks that Beijing loyalists appear to have an agenda against the pro-democracy camp and Independence advocates and are mobilizing their supporters to achieve their own political goals. The pro-Beijing camp is linking leaders of the Occupy Movement to those who support Hong Kong's breaking away from the mainland. This harms Carrie Lam's efforts to heal the divisions in society. Sociology academic Minnie Li Ming said local and mainland students were too emotional in the recent standoff and urged Hong Kong students and residents to consider their mainland counterparts‚Äô feelings during political campaigns, as isolating them could mean losing a large group of pro-democracy supporters. The provocative messages banners and posters have continued to fuel tension and distrust between the city and the mainland. Frang Cheng, writing for Ejinisight, advises \\"If Beijing really wants to kill talk of independence, all it has to do is to hold out hope of meaningful political reform in Hong Kong. Young people, and others, need to feel that they are masters of their own home. Once that happens, the idea of Hong Kong independence will lose attraction.\\" Reaction University officials The vice-chancellor of Hong Kong Baptist University, Roland Chin stated that he would allow students to discuss Hong Kong independence on campus, as long as they don't do anything illegal or dangerous. But as long they stay within the law and will bear the consequences if they violate it. Vice-chancellor Joseph Sung of the Chinese University said the university should not be turned into a political arena. ‚ÄúThe idea of an independent Hong Kong is not only in breach of the Basic Law of Hong Kong but also contrary to what I personally believe. Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China; this is beyond dispute. When discussing and debating political issues, our students should always do so peacefully and rationally, and conduct the discussion or debate in a respectful and patient manner.‚Äù Chan Chi-sum, a vice-chairman of the board of trustees of the New Asia College at Chinese University, believes students should have freedom to discuss different issues, including Hong Kong independence however putting up banners advocating it is a step too far. Lingnan University of Hong Kong President Leonard Cheng said that discussions on Hong Kong independence will be allowed on campus, even though the university is not in support of the idea itself. The democracy wall is managed by the University's students union and the university had nothing to do with the poster being torn down. Ho Lok Sang, the dean of business at Chu Hai College of Higher Education remarked \\"Challenging China‚Äôs sovereignty over Hong Kong challenges the Chinese Constitution. Hong Kong enjoys privileges explicitly spelled out in the Basic Law, but is otherwise is still governed by the Chinese Constitution. Advocating Hong Kong independence will jeopardise the basic interests of its people, who desire a stable society.\\" Professor Johannes Chan urged the acts such as posting banners and posters, without violence, were protected within the scope of free speech and advocacy of issues including same-sex marriage and legalising euthanasia were also against the Basic Law, yet city residents were free to discuss them. Arthur Li, The chairman of the University of Hong Kong's governing council, theorises the motivation of students supporting Hong Kong Independence: ‚ÄúWhy do people still want Hong Kong independence? It‚Äôs very simple. Our young people in the university cannot compete with our mainland students in terms of scholarships, in terms of prizes, mainland students are winning all the way. Instead of saying let‚Äôs lift our game, let‚Äôs compete, they are saying we don‚Äôt want to play with you any more, we want to run away, we want to be independent from you. It‚Äôs basically the mentality of losers.‚Äù University student unions representatives Lai Hiu-ching, chair of the EdUHK student union said \\"the democracy board on the campus should be a place where teachers and students could express their views freely. If they believe the students have broken the law, they should definitely call the police instead of removing the banners themselves.\\" New Asia College's students' union responded by stating the issue was not whether calls for independence should be supported, but whether its discussion should be permitted on campus and that peaceful acts such as putting up banners and posters should be allowed. Tommy Cheung, a former student union president has called for discussions and conciliation to resolve the standoff over controversial posters and banners on university campuses. Ryan Lee, the president of Lingnan University Students‚Äô Union remarked ‚ÄúI am worried that the heads of ten universities have become political puppets.‚Äù He also said that there was a widespread consensus among students that the governing bodies of universities were being controlled by pro-Beijing appointees, hence not looking out for students' interests, but the Hong Kong government's and the Central government's. Hong Kong Government Chief Executive of the Hong Kong, Carrie Lam condemned the \\"Hong Kong independence\\" slogans which were displayed in Hong Kong's universities, saying such remarks had \\"overstepped the bottom line of society\\" and were in violation of the country's sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests. The Police commissioner Stephen Lo stated ‚ÄúIf advocates of independence violate the laws of Hong Kong, police will take solemn and just law enforcement action for sure.‚Äù Chief Executive Carrie Lam stated ‚ÄúAll I want to say is that this is not a question of freedom of speech. It is a question of whether we are respecting ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô, and a constitutional question of whether we care if Hong Kong can continue to have our rights and freedoms protected under ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô, so that we can develop and our people can live in a stable and prosperous city. There is no question of curbing students‚Äô freedom of speech or universities‚Äô academic and institutional autonomy. There is no need to muddle things up. There is no room for any discussion on the independence of Hong Kong because that breaches \\"one country, two systems,‚Äù which underlines the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. That violates the Basic Law, and is absolutely not in the overall interest of Hong Kong. So that position is very clear.\\" Matthew Cheung, Chief Secretary described the joint statement (The heads of 10 Hong Kong universities condemning the ‚Äúabuses‚Äù of free speech) as explicit and correct. Freedom of speech has its limits and there is absolutely no room for discussing the city's independence and any advocacy of independence challenges national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and cannot be tolerated.ws.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1354416-20170916.htm Paul Chan Mo- po, the Financial Secretary expressed hope that the people of Hong Kong would stop the wrangling, as it leads to polarization. Chinese government Wang Zhimin, the new director of China Liaison Office said ‚ÄúAcross all of China‚Äôs 9.6 million square kilometres of land, around the whole globe, the whole world ‚Äì there is zero room for Hong Kong independence. There is zero tolerance among all Chinese nationals including the seven-odd million Hong Kong compatriots.‚Äù Mainland Media On September 8, the People's Daily lashed out at the student unions of Hong Kong universities for promoting the idea of Hong Kong independence. On September 9, an editorial in China Daily, denounces the Separatists in Hong Kong for launching a campaign of ‚Äúpro-independence‚Äù posters and banners across university campuses. It states that Hong Kong Independence forces are linking up with Taiwan Independence forces and encourages the SAR government and Hong Kong patriotic forces to exorcise those brainwashed youths possessed by evil forces. On September 11, the People Daily ran a commentary suggesting Hong Kong authorities must ‚Äútake legal action‚Äù to forbid residents from advocating Hong Kong Independence. Using Germany as an example, the promotion of Nazism is illegal and considered a criminal offense, Hong Kong should do the same for Hong Kong Independence. Executive Council of Hong Kong members Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that students at the Chinese University could have broken the law by putting up banners and posters advocating Hong Kong independence, as it infringes upon on section 9 of the Crimes Ordinance that any publication is published with seditious intent then it may well be an offence. He later called the city's laws should be amended to better address calls for independence. He said ‚ÄúIf people are simply hanging up banners or handing out leaflets about independence, without advocating for it through violence or by illegal means, then the offence of sedition shouldn‚Äôt apply. However, it doesn‚Äôt mean the law should have no control over the spreading of political beliefs which threaten national security.‚Äù Executive Council convener Bernard Charnwut Chan said the government should not interfere too much in affairs on campus and these should be handled by the universities' management themselves. The bottom line is that students should not break the law. He later said the issue of Hong Kong independence should be discussed not just between students and universities, but also in the wider community. But the purpose of the discussions would not be to advocate independence, but to clarify why it just can't be done and how it is against Hong Kong's best interests. Politicians Maggie Chan Man- ki, a former DAB member said \\"promotion of independence could be considered a 'seditious intention,' which is against the Crimes Ordinance.\\" Civic Party leader Alan Leong Kah-kit remarked that some of the laws and provisions are set during colonial times and are not suited in modern-day context. Ip Kin- yuen, the education sector Legislative Council member called for EdUHK to handle ‚Äòdemocracy wall‚Äô incident, because the incident will continue to snowball if some members of the public and outside organizations to continue get involved. He later called for universities to allow debates on Hong Kong independence, even if the idea is unconstitutional. Students should be allowed to discuss things that may be illegal so that they can understand why it's wrong. Regina Ip, leader of New People's Party, theorizes that Pro- independence posters on campuses are the most radical expression of widespread disaffection in retaliation for government's successful appeal in the Court of Appeal jailing three student leaders who stormed government headquarters in September 2014. She notes that \\"Beijing and the Hong Kong government have much work to do to win over young people‚Äôs hearts.\\" Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong lawmaker Edward Law Kwok-fun said discussing and promoting independence were two things. Tam Yiu-chung, DAB former chairman says the pro-independence banners that recently appeared on university campuses were the work of a small group of attention-seeking students, and that most people here don't support Hong Kong independence. Those students were just looking for an excuse to oppose the central government and were wasting their energy. Other organisations Kevin Yam Kin-fung, founder of the Progressive Lawyers Group, argued no law was broken as the flyers and posters had merely discussed the issues and did not insinuate or encourage others to cause harm, and found it strange that CUHK is setting limits on free speech. Alan Hoo, the chairman of the Basic Law Institute, called on the Hong Kong government to clear up ambiguity on whether such actions (displaying Hong Kong Independence banners) necessitated criminal prosecution. Chris Yeung, a journalist and founder of Voice of Hong Kong, remarked that \\"The Government has stepped up acts against advocacy for pro- independence, in both deeds and words. One major initiative was to kick out pan-democrat legislators who deviated from the oath-taking ordinance when they were sworn in. Pro-independence groups were given warnings that their activities might breach the law. Schools were cautioned by the education authorities not to hold discussion on independence in classrooms. It is against the background of a hard-hit approach by the mainland and Hong Kong governments to stifle public discussion on the issue of Hong Kong independence that those posters had been put on, presumably by students. It is obvious that their acts could also been seen as a show of defiance against the authorities‚Äô move to muzzle any talk about independence. To students, their universities campuses could perhaps be the last corner in the city where they can discuss anything freely without any restrictions. The row between students and the management of universities over the room for free debate in campuses when it comes to the issue of independence is a prelude to sharper conflicts in the months to come. The return of the issue of Hong Kong independence to public limelight has flared up fresh conflicts between mainlanders and Hongkongers. Universities have emerged as the battlefields of highly-sensitive political ideas and sharply-conflicting values. They have never been a quiet and peaceful days. But like our society, they will be getting more noisy and chaotic.\\" http://www.vohk.hk/2017/09/10/universities-now-battlefields-of- politics-not-ideas/ Tian Feilong, an associate professor at Beihang University‚Äôs Law School in Beijing, and a director of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, reflected \\"The radicalisation of student unions impedes rational discussion and the blooming of a true diversity of views, thus hindering the development of democracy on campus. The Hong Kong government must shoulder its constitutional responsibility and prosecute those who flout the sedition clauses in the Crimes Ordinance, to create court precedents that would plug the loopholes in the city‚Äôs national security law, before Article 23 legislation is enacted. Pro-independence students have broken the law to cause serious damage to Hong Kong and themselves as they misunderstand the legal boundaries of free speech. One logical solution is to clearly define the legal boundaries and liabilities of free speech.\\" Lau Ming- wai, the head of the government's Youth Commission has accused the public and the media of overreacting to the recent unfurling of Hong Kong independence banners at local universities, while calling the action both immature and frivolous. There's a need to respect freedom of speech and that right also comes with responsibilities. The recent standoff showed that young people have a weak civic and moral awareness and pro-independence banners shouldn't be encouraged. Winnie Tam, the former chairwoman of the Hong Kong Bar Association said people who put up materials advocating Hong Kong independence on university campuses are testing the limits of their freedoms and the law. It is acceptable to discuss Hong Kong independence in an academic way, debating the pros and cons, but Pro-independence banners that appeared at various universities may have constituted seditious intent and might have violated the crimes ordinance. Ho Hon-kuen, the chairman of Education Convergence, said that he will not defend the freedom to discuss independence because advocating independence is against Article One of the Basic Law which states that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China. Chi Wang, the president of the U.S. China Policy Foundation reflected ‚ÄúDissatisfaction with China‚Äôs government is understandable, but angrily calling for independence is not an actual solution. The most this movement can do is to grab media attention, anger Beijing and incite division. Hong Kong has maintained its unique identity even while the world around them changed. Instead of hanging signs and chanting empty slogans, the youth of Hong Kong should be learning from their city‚Äôs past. They should find ways to keep their city and identity strong and unique, regardless of what flag flies from their government buildings.‚Äù Lau Siu-kai, the vice chairman of the Chinese Association on Hong Kong and Macau Studies said to protect the institutional autonomy of local tertiary institutions, university chiefs must take steps to control the situation themselves or in future various \\"forces\\" could enter university campuses to counter calls for independence. Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers expressed their sadness witnessing the recent standoff at the universities and vowed to stand firm on what is right in teaching Hong Kong's next generation. Socialist Action stated it \\"stands firmly for the defence of the democratic rights and freedom of speech of students and all other groups. We say debating independence is a democratic right, not a crime. To resist new repressive restrictions students need to organise actively on campus ‚Äì a one-day strike of university students would be the most effective response as a way to launch mass resistance to the political crackdown.\\" Other University of Hong Kong principal law lecturer Eric Cheung Tat-ming remarked that some of the laws and provisions are outdated that they are not applicable in modern-day context. Michael Chugani, a Hong Kong-based commentator and journalist reflected that \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs politics have become so divisive that finding common ground on anything is impossible. A civilized society should know how to put politics aside when compassion is called for. Hong Kong‚Äôs young should also know civilized societies have moral lines. Crossing those lines come with a cost. If there are no consequences, free speech will have no limits.\\" Reverend Peter Koon Ho-ming, the Anglican Church‚Äôs provincial secretary general in Hong Kong, said the controversial topic of advocating Hong Kong‚Äôs Independence from China should not be discussed in schools without telling students about the bloodshed it would likely unleash. Also the issue might be too sensitive at the moment for university academics to research, without being accused of advocating it. Chris Patten, Hong Kong‚Äôs last colonial governor said ‚ÄúThey should start talking and not shouting at one another. So I very much hope the students will get into a dialogue with their vice chancellor and I hope the reverse is true as well. I made clear I was also very much against allowing the campaign for democracy to morph into a campaign for independence, which isn‚Äôt going to happen, which is provocative, and which dilutes support for democracy.‚Äù He also theories that ‚ÄúI think the calls for independence were a consequence of not talking to people about greater democratic reform‚Äù. Subsequent events Dozens of Lingnan University students staged a protest on September 27, calling for Junius Ho be banned from entering the institution's campus, in order to ensure people's safety. Ho is a member of the university's governing council and the students say the council should consider penalising him for the controversial comment. They also said the university should publicly condemn Ho's remark and make it clear that it doesn't share his view. Around 800 students and lecturers have submitted a petition of their demands to a university representative. The organiser of the rally, Chen Pui-hing, warned that if the institution fails properly, the protesters may organise a \\"campus occupation\\" or storm some of its buildings. On October 3, a group of 20 students staged an ‚Äúoccupy‚Äù campaign by camping on the campus and covered three of the university's emblems at the campus with black cloths and hung black banners bearing words blaming the management for staying silent and mocking Ho. The university responded by saying Junius Ho's comments were unrelated to Lingnan, as they were made in his own personal capacity. At the end of September 2017, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University president Timothy Tong Wai-cheung announced he will soon retire at the end of 2018. He declined to renew his contract for another five years. He has been the president since 2008. In October 2017, Junius Ho claims that there are one million Hong Kong residents who are Hong Kong Independence supporters as they don't have a Home Return Permit. On October 10, Republic of China (Taiwan) flags and other celebrating posters appeared on New Asia College campus at Chinese University of Hong Kong, to celebrate Double Ten Day, however the university management removed the flags, but not other promotional posters, including the areas managed by the Student union. The Student union did not put up such materials. The union issued the following statement ‚ÄúThe college‚Äôs attitude in ignoring students is unacceptable. The flags caused no safety issues, there were also no protest slogans ‚Äì the union cannot understand why the college removed them.‚Äù They demanded an apology as university did not communicate with the union beforehand and they may raise the flags again in protest. On October 28, The student discipline committee of New Asia College punished Ernie Chow Shue- fung, the former CUHK student union president. He received a removable demerit on his record and has to perform 40 hours of college service for using foul language (‚ÄúChee-na‚Äù) against others on campus during the September 7th standoff with Mainland students at CUHK's democracy wall.http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2117397/former-hong- kong-student-chief-punished-over-chee-na-tirade On January 18, 2018, the Pro- Beijing camp, in control of the Legislative Council, protected Junius Ho from being reprimand over his incitement to \\"kill without mercy\\" during a public rally in September 2017. Gary Chan representing the pro-Beijing camp, claims that the motion was meaningless as its outdated and silly. Ray Chan representing the Pro-democracy camp disagrees with the reasoning, and states that Gary Chan and his colleagues are diverting attention and indirectly supporting hate speech. In response to these events, Junius Ho challenged the public by saying \\"If you want to be my enemy, please come to Leung Tin Village, I will deal with you there\\" https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/18/legislature-rejects-move-censure-pro- beijing-lawmaker-junius-ho-killing-remarks/ In April 2018, the Hong Kong Police Force claimed there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to prosecute Junius Ho over his incitement to \\"kill without mercy\\" during a public rally in September 2017.https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/04/20/insufficient-proof-prosecute- lawmaker-junius-ho-remarks-killing-independence-advocates-police/ See also *Hong Kong‚ÄìMainland China conflict * List of higher education institutions in Hong Kong * Hong Kong Independence * Youth in Hong Kong References History of Hong Kong Anti-Chinese sentiment in Asia Localism in Hong Kong Politics of Hong Kong ","title":"CUHK democracy wall standoff"},{"id":"55283154","title":"Indoor athletics at the 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games"},{"id":"55283162","text":"Legacy is an album by pianist Ronnie Mathews which was recorded in 1978 and released on the Bee Hive label.Mosaic Records: The Complete Bee Hive Sessions - Track Listing, Personnel & Recording Dates, accessed September 19, 2017Jazzlists: Bee Hive Records discography, accessed September 19, 2017Jazzlists: Ronnie Mathews discography, accessed September 19, 2017Ronnie Mathews catalog, accessed September 19, 2017Ronnie Mathews Leader Entry, accessed September 19, 2017 Reception The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow stated, \\"Pianist Ronnie Mathews assembled an all-star group for this hard bop set.

The film stars Gippy Grewal and Aditi Sharma and is directed by Simerjit Singh who belongs to the same region of Moga where Joginder Singh was born. This movie was a high budget film. The film is authentic to that in the era of 1962. The movie was shot in Suratgarh or Rajasthan which is nearly 100 km from the Indo-Pakistan border, to give a look of pre-independence village of Punjab. Additional shooting of the movie took place in October 2017 at the Dras sector in Jammu and Kashmir to give real life experience of the Tawang valley during the 1962 war.  Plot  This movie is based upon the life, struggle and valor of a subedar in Indian Army who achieved his martyrdom while fighting the Chinese in the Sino-Indian War in 1962.

It stars Siwan Morris, Gareth David-Lloyd, Joanna Ignaczewska, and Cinzia Monreale. A radio DJ (Morris) and her engineer (David-Lloyd) invite a psychic (Monreale) on their last broadcast. At the same time, a listener (Ignaczewska) is haunted by the victim of a serial killer. It was shot in Wales in late 2014 and released in the UK in April 2016.  Plot  A serial killer stalks young women in Northern Wales. Known as the Wedlock Killer, he chops off a finger before brutally murdering his victims. Amid reports of a new victim, Laurie Wolf, a radio DJ, becomes bitter when her local radio program is cancelled and she has trouble finding a new job. On the last day of her show, she rants to her listeners about the disappearance of local radio programs and ignores the corporate playlist. Ben Evans, her engineer, suggests they have a psychic, Carla Zaza, as a guest. Laurie, a sceptic, reluctantly agrees when Ben says it will further annoy the owners. Before the broadcast begins, Kate Komisarczyk speaks with Ben over the internet, upsetting her boyfriend, Nick Keller. Though Kate has refused to meet Ben, Nick believes she is being naive by befriending people from the internet. Kate and Nick leave her disabled son, Marek, with a babysitter. Kate tells the babysitter she is visiting Ben to attend the radio broadcast, but she instead drives Nick to a house he intends to burgle. Although Kate is nervous, Nick reassures her that they are not truly stealing anything, as the money is from a client who has refused to repay his debt. Nick enters a nearby mansion and leaves Kate as lookout. As she listens to Laurie's broadcast, she fails to notice a bloody and battered ghost has momentarily appeared in her car. An old man surprises her when he approaches. When he complains she is on private property, Kate says her boyfriend has gone to find a petrol station and will return shortly. Dubious, the man insists on waiting with her. Kate listens to Laurie dismissively interview Carla. At the station, Carla becomes curious when she hears an anomaly in the broadcast, eventually convincing Ben and then Laurie that it is electronic voice phenomenon. When Nick calls Kate to check on her, she uses the opportunity to get rid of the old man by saying Nick found escaped farm animals, assuming he is a local farmer Nick said may appear. Before leaving to investigate her report, the man indicates that he lives in the mansion. Confused, Kate demands answers from Nick, who admits his story is untrue; before he can explain further, he is apparently murdered. As Kate investigates the mansion, Carla performs a live seance. The spirit, Sarah, says the Wedlock Killer murdered her on a farm. As Kate discovers Sarah's body in the mansion, the old man, revealed to be Nick's father, Alan, accuses her of killing his daughter. Before he can exact vengeance on her, the Wedlock Killer surprises and kills him. The Wedlock Killer expresses surprise that Kate is there, cripples her, and leaves to retrieve her son to kill in front of her. After Kate frees herself, she finds her dying boyfriend; Nick gives her the money and explains that he did not want her to know he was desperate enough to steal from his own family. Marek becomes possessed by Sarah while listening to the seance on the radio. Kate leaves for the radio station, where her babysitter has taken Marek. When she arrives, she finds everyone but Marek and Ben dead. Ben explains that the show was recorded last night and was broadcast from tape. He plays the last part of the tape for her, where Laurie discovers evidence he is the Wedlock Killer. After sabotaging any parts of the broadcast that could reveal his guilt, he killed Laurie and Carla. Kate stabs him and flees, guided by Sarah's ghost to a room where Ben has handcuffed Marek to the wall. Before she can free him, Ben knocks her unconscious. Kate revives as Ben is about to immolate her. She fights him off but is again overpowered. Before Ben can douse her in petrol, Sarah appears in front of him, momentarily frightening him and causing him to spill the petrol on himself. Kate grabs his lighter and sets him on fire, killing him. As she returns to the radio station to free Marek, Laurie's last words play, questioning whether there is an afterlife and repudiating her earlier sceptism about the paranormal.

The two had previously collaborated on several films, including Dog Soldiers, Marshall's debut. Shooting took place from 18 August to 13 September 2014 in Wales, mostly in Ruabon. Evers-Swindell said he wanted to explicitly set the film in Wales because the area was frequently seen in films but doubled for other locations.  Release  Dark Signal opened in the UK on 21 April 2016. It was theatrically released in the US on 2 June 2017 and on video on demand four days later.  Reception  Though he complimented the directing and cast, Paul Mount of Starburst said the film has a \\"sluggish and often unfocussed script\\", unlikable characters, and a villain without any apparent motivation. Mount rated it 6/10 stars, concluding that it is entertaining but not memorable. Kimber Myers of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"dull, poorly structured movie\\" that substitutes scenes of violent gore for atmosphere. Craig D. Lindsey of LA Weekly wrote that the film becomes incoherent because too many different ideas were combined.

Club career For almost a decade, Cluj-Napoca has been enchanted by the talent of the player with number 7 from Universitatea Cluj's team. Chroniclers of the day called him the last romantic of the pitch. His dribbling, his slopes and his speed of reaction have subjugated the supporters of Universitatea Cluj. Zoli's best friend, poet Irimie Negoi»õƒÉ, called him \\"Hamlet of the green pitch\\" and his former coach, Constantin Tea»ôcƒÉ, described him as \\"a very great footballer, who does not like football!\\". Zolt√°n Ivansuc, the legend of Universitatea Cluj born in the horseshoe on the banks of the Some»ô, fascinated the football of Cluj-Napoca. In the fall of 1959, at just 21 years old, Ivansuc was attracted by the student's bohemian mirage and transferred from Re»ôi»õa to Cluj-Napoca. Zoli always met in the national teams with Viorel Mateianu, Emil Petru and Felician Mure≈üan, the three Cluj people who told him about the atmosphere of the university team. He was attracted by vocal \\"U\\" like a magnet, he did not resist the temptation, like many others. This is how Ivansuc wanted to come to Cluj, and there was also the desire to attend the Faculty of Medicine, remembers Remus C√¢mpeanu, his former teammate. The two lived together for six years in a three-room house, provided by the university club. His physical qualities, his dribbling, that stunned his opponents made him the supporters idol. Zoli became a symbol in Cluj, and the people were crowding at the trainings only to see Ivansuc kicking or making an extra dribbling. On the street, he was recognized by all the people who greet him and at Conti was the master of the saloon, the place where he could eat his favorite schnitzel and could drink a glass of wine, C√¢mpeanu remembered. I never understood him. It was hard for me to talk to him, always after he had a big game he was closing in, he was lost and with bad thoughts. But he was perhaps the most talented player of Universitatea Cluj said Dr. Mircea Luca, one of the most respected former presidents of Universitatea Cluj. The goal scored by Zoli Ivansuc in the Romanian Cup final against Dinamo Pite»ôti (2-1), disputed in 1965 on the Republicii Stadium, brought the unique trophy in the showcase of Universitatea Cluj. Supporters waited the players with banners at Cluj airport. I will never forget this goal. Even now I remember the phase. I was at home in Sibiu and watching TV. I saw that the goalkeeper, Mogu»õ, kicked the ball, Zoli was with his back on the goal somewhere in the middle of the pitch. He picked up the ball, kicked it over and then shot, a shot like I've never seen before in my life! The stadium was standing. This was Zoli, the mark of inexplicable situations and angles, even impossible, remembered Sanda Popescu, his ex-wife. After winning the Romanian Cup in 1965, \\"U\\" Cluj played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup with Atl√©tico Madrid, being eliminated by the Spanish team. At the 2nd match, played in Madrid, Ivansuc was approached by Real Madrid's impresario, Wogl, who came in particular to persuade him to stay in Spain. He talked to him in the hotel lobby for about two hours, but he couldn't convince him. Zoli came to me and told me he was not going anywhere, for him were more important the Medicine and Cluj than anything else, I was stunned, C√¢mpeanu said. His ex-wife, Sanda Popescu, confirmed the interest of the Spanish club for him. When he came home, he told me that the Spanish club was interested in having him in the team, but there was also a club from Belgium, but he did not even want to hear about his departure, maybe he was alive now if he left remembers, with tears in her eyes, Mrs. Popescu. 1,000 spectators attended the Universitatea Cluj trainings just to track Zoli Ivansuc's movements, dribblings and shots. One match only lost Ivansuc. With King Bacchus, who overcame him at 44 years old, on a cold January day. His former wife, Sanda Popescu, whom he divorced in 1975, having a girl together, Barbara Ivansuc, claimed that Constantin Tea»ôcƒÉ's second reign on U's bench meant the end of Ivansuc's career. In 1963, when Tea≈ücƒÉ left Cluj, he could not win the war with the team players, including Zoli. Then, when he came back in 1967, one day he made it clear to Ivansuc: \\"Then , I left. Now, it's your turn to leave.\\" Zoli was extremely angry at home, I do not think he spoke all day, said Ms. Popescu, and the reason immediately came to Tea»ôcƒÉ. We were on our way to Astoria Hotel, where the camp was, in the car. A trolleybus did not notice us and came in behind us. Until the Police arrived and investigated, Zoli was late at the training. Tea≈ücƒÉ then kicked him out of the team. He suffered a lot because of that, claimed his ex-wife.Misteriosul domn Ivansuc. Povara numƒÉrului ‚Äú7‚Äù International career On 30 September 1962, he made his debut for the Romania in a match against Morocco. Personal life Always surrounded by friends from intellectual circles, writers, journalists, poets and actors, a complex personality, Ivansuc was a mystery in the locker room of \\"the students\\". At Zoli, when he came to the pitch, it was all a mood. If he was in the mood to play football, he was doing misunderstood things for his opponents. He never hurt anyone in the locker room, but he did not even like to get in front. It was a modestly rare encounter. The people came at his home for a spritz, for a story before the games. He did not refuse anyone, he sat in bed with a book in his hand, he listened to all of them and intervened in the discussion only when he had something to fill in, C√¢mpeanu remembered. Ivansuc was married with Sanda Popescu, who divorced in 1975, having a girl together, Barbara Ivansuc. After Tea»ôcƒÉ incident, he began practicing as a doctor at the C√¢mpia Turzii Factory, and then gave up. The sadness enveloped him and threw him into drink's arms. He died alone. As it was all his life, even when he was surrounded by a dozen buddies at a glass of wine.

History  Following World War I, Pozieres was one of the Pikedale soldier settlements established in the Granite Belt area of the Darling Downs. As part of this initiative, the Amiens branch railway of the Southern railway line was constructed west of Cottonvale. The line was not built to convey passengers but rather to transport fruit from the soldiers' orchards to markets in Brisbane and Sydney. The line was opened on 7 June 1920 and it closed on 28 February 1974. The name Pozieres comes from the railway station name assigned by the Queensland Railways Department in 1920, which in turn was suggested by surveyor George Grant and the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League of Australia, commemorating the famous World War I Battle of Pozi√®res. The grave accent in Pozi√®res is omitted as Queensland Government policy on place naming restricts names to the \\"standard alphabet\\". A postal receiving office was opened at Pozieres on 1 May 1921, upgraded to a post office about March 1924. Pozieres State School opened on 16 June 1921. In November 1921 an Anglican minister, Reverend Alan Thompson, was appointed to the soldier settlement towns but at June 1922, the parishioners were lobbying for a church as services were being held in private homes.

The normability criterion can be seen as a result in same vein as the Nagata‚ÄìSmirnov metrization theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable. The result was proved by the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolayevich Kolmogorov in 1934. (See Section 8.1.3) Statement of the theorem It may be helpful to first recall the following terms: * A topological vector space is a vector space X equipped with a topology mathcal{T} such that the vector space operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition are continuous. * A topological vector space (X, mathcal{T}) is called normable if there is a norm  cdot  colon X to mathbb{R} on X such that the open balls of the norm  cdot  generate the given topology mathcal{T}. (Note well that a given normable topological vector space might admit multiple such norms.) * A topological space (X, mathcal{T}) is called a T1 space if, for every two distinct points x, y in X, there is an open neighbourhood U_{x} of x that does not contain y. In a topological vector space, this is equivalent to requiring that, for every x eq 0, there is an open neighbourhood of the origin not containing x. Note that being T1 is weaker than being a Hausdorff space, in which every two distinct points x, y in X admit open neighbourhoods U_{x} of x and U_{y} of y with U_{x} cap U_{y} = varnothing; since normed and normable spaces are always Hausdorff, it is a \\"surprise\\" that the theorem only requires T1. * A subset A of a vector space X is a convex set if, for any two points x, y in A, the line segment joining them lies wholly within A, i.e., for all 0 leq t leq 1, (1 - t) x + t y in A. * A subset A of a topological vector space (X, mathcal{T}) is a bounded set if, for every open neighbourhood U of the origin, there exists a scalar lambda so that A subseteq lambda U. (One can think of U as being \\"small\\" and lambda as being \\"big enough\\" to inflate U to cover A.) Expressed in these terms, Kolmogorov's normability criterion is as follows: Theorem. A topological vector space (X, mathcal{T}) is normable if and only if it is a T1 space and admits a bounded convex neighbourhood of the origin.

Launched in 2015, the venture absorbed Turn First Artists which was Stennett's original artist management company. Since then, the activities of the company have evolved to include a record label (Access Records), publishing (First Access Publishing), Sports Management (First Access Sports) and a seed funding venture called \\"Fund by First Access Entertainment\\". The company is most known for managing recording artists Iggy Azalea, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J, Rita Ora and Zayn Malik. In 2019, American burlesque-come-recording group the Pussycat Dolls reformed and signed to Access Records as independent artists. Prior to his death in 2017, American rapper Lil Peep was also managed by FAE and his music was released posthumously through the company and Peep's estate. The rapper's death is subject to a wrongful death lawsuit by Peep's mother against FAE, the outcome of which was going through the US justice system in late 2019-early 2020. History First Access Entertainment began as Turn First Artists, an artist management and development agency based out of West London, founded by music manager, Sarah Stennett. Stennett has been responsible for launching the careers of artists including Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J. Stennett also co-founded law firm SSB, which represents Adele, alongside setting up the Grammy award-winning songwriting and production team The Invisible Men, which includes her husband George Astasio. In October 2015, it was announced Stennett and Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, a privately held industrial group with major holdings in the music, media and telecommunications sectors, would form of a new joint venture called First Access Entertainment. First Access Entertainment offers services across artist and model management, recorded music, music publishing, strategic brand partnerships, TV/film development and sports management. In 2017, Oscar Scivier joined Access Records as their President of A&R; from Ultra Records. Blavatnik would resign as a company director in October 2019 and was replaced with Stephen John Hendry. Access Records and artist management services Roster As of 2020, First Access Entertainment is home to a range of acts including, but not limited to: * Algee Smith (record deal) * Ashlee Simpson (record deal) * Bebe Rexha (management deal) * Brian D.

It was good for fan loyalty\\". Commenting on the venture, Benros noted that in the future fans would have to pay for such opportunities. Referencing the current COVID-19 pandemic he said \\"the economy has taken a big hit, and brands are trying to find creative and effective ways to reach their demographic. Brands also know that a main source of an independent artist‚Äôs revenue stream has been depleted. I think it‚Äôs a mutually beneficial partnership as long as it doesn‚Äôt compromise the integrity and aesthetic of the artist.\\" Other Ventures First Access Publishing Following its first 18 months in service, FAE signed a joint agreement with publishing companyWarner/Chappell to provide global support for FAE's \\"publishing roster for synchronization in film, TV, advertising, games and other media, as well as provide global copyright administration.\\" Warner/Chappell CEO Jon Platt said of the venture, \\"we're very pleased to partner with the terrific team at First Access Entertainment. This partnership maximizes the skills of our two companies, and together we look forward to building long, successful careers for diverse and accomplished songwriters, now and in the future.\\" Stennett also commented on the venture during a press release, saying \\"I'm very much looking forward to working hand-in-hand with the incredible team at Warner/Chappell on developing and maximising the full scope of our artist‚Äôs repertoire across a broad range of media and entertainment platforms.\\" First Access Sports In 2018, FAE launched a sports management agency to represent sports stars from all fields. During an interview with Music Week, Stennett said \\"We recognise the extraordinary talent of our athletes as unique, powerful individuals, youth culture stars with enormous cultural presence and influence. Our mission is to create the foundations for exemplary performance within the scope of their core discipline and to enhance their visibility and ancillary value.\\" Co-CEO Len Blavatnik added \\"First Access Entertainment has a proven track record in talent discovery and representation. We have a team in place that can push the boundaries of traditional sports management.\\" Fund by Access Entertainment Also in 2018, the company joined forces with Simon Tikhman to launch \\"Fund by Access Entertainment,\\" a seed funding initiative for youth entrepreneurs launching ventures centred around culture. Of the venture, Tikhman said, \\"This is a natural next step ‚Äì by seeding, incubating and giving aspiring companies access to the extensive global infrastructure of First Access Entertainment, they will have all the tools they need to take their ideas to the next level.\\" The Qube First Access was also a founding investor in \\"The Qube\\", a \\"first of its kind venue and community for music professionals to connect and collaborate. The flagship West London venue is a 22,000 square-foot premise designed by Munro Acoustics, featuring 30 state of the art soundproofed recording studios, breakout spaces and a tranquil garden terrace is due to open in January 2020.\\" Other partners in the venture include, Riz Ahmed, Krept & Konan, Rudimental's Amir Amor, Mixcloud co-founder Nikhil Shah, and Concord Music. Controversies Lil Peep was managed by First Access Entertainment as part of a joint venture agreement, prior to his death in 2017. Death of Lil Peep In 2017, American rapper Lil Peep died of an accidental drug overdose; the rapper was managed by First Access Entertainment. Peep's mother Liza Womack filed wrongful death charges against First Access in 2019, \\"accusing them of negligence and other breaches of contract which, the lawsuit alleges, contributed to the rapper‚Äôs death in 2017 of an accidental drugs overdose.\\" The lawsuit claims that the company had a role in providing access to drugs and \\"allowing a culture of drug-taking on Lil Peep's tour, despite being aware of his addictions, as well as supplying the rapper with illegal drugs and prescription medications, and at times actually encouraging him to take them.\\" In responding statements, First Access expressed disappointment in the lawsuit: First Access formally filed court documents at the Los Angeles Superior Court on 23 December 2019 to dispute all claims including claims of \\"negligence, breach of contract, and wrongful death.\\" Stennett told Rolling Stone that \\"[she] felt very protective of him from day one.\\" In later documents and court filings, First Access said that their work with Lil Peep was an \\"arm's length business arrangement\\", something disputed by the rapper's mother. Despite court filings, First Access supported the release of Peep's first posthumous album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2 (2019) which reached number four on the Billboard 200 albums chart, a career-best for the rapper. FAE has since released statements about their belief that had no contractual responsibility for Lil Peep's personal life and that a ruling to suggest so would damage management businesses, \\"Imposing a duty on FAE Ltd. or FAE LLC to prevent [Lil Peep's] drug overdose would extend the boundaries of legal obligations far beyond any precedent, and far beyond the contractual obligations and reasonable expectations of parties doing business. It would convert businesses engaged in the music and entertainment industries into full-time babysitters for artists. That clearly was not the parties' intent upon entering the JVA [(joint-venture agreement)]. Adam Lublin Adam Lublin, a former executive of AEG, worked for FAE as a consultant. In 2019, he was charged with \\"two counts of burglary and one count of sexual abuse\\" at the Manhattan Criminal Court, before being charged \\"on a second count of sexual abuse and burglary against the first victim's roommate\\". The company subsequently terminated all business with Lublin.

In the , Flying Fish Point had a population of 425 people.  Geography  Flying Fish Point is on the northern shore of the mouth of the Johnstone River as it enters the Coral Sea.  History  Enjoying the beach at Flying Fish Point, 1930 The town was originally called Musgrave, but on 1 December 1961 it was officially changed to Flying Fish Point. The town's name comes from the headland, which in turn was named by explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple on 4 October 1873, after the twelve ton cutter Flying Fish which was the principal vessel of his North East Coast Expedition. The southern shore of the mouth of the Johnstone River, Coquette Point, was named after another cutter in the expedition. C Thomas Henry Fitzgerald had successfully established sugarcane plantations in the Mackay area and in April 1880 came to Flying Fish Point and planted sugarcane there on 15 June 1880. The focus of his sugarcane interests shifted further up the Johnstone River resulting in the establishing of Geraldton (later Innisfail) as the major sugarcane growing area. Flying Fish Point with its sandy beach instead became a popular holiday town for the area. The first Catholic mass was celebrated in Flying Fish Point on 1 January 1940 in Edwin Shaw's hut. Flying Fish Point Provisional School opened on 23 January 1899. It closed on a number of occasions due to low student numbers. It also closed for a period in 1918 after the school building was destroyed in a cyclone in March 1918. The school also closed for a period in World War II from about February 1942 when people were evacuated from the district due to fears of a Japanese invasion but the school did not reopen until 1947. It is unclear when it became Flying Fish Point State School as it is today.  Education  Flying Fish Point State School is a government co-educational primary (P-6) school on Maud Street.

Amarteifo was a graduate of Ghana School of Survey who immigrated to Nigeria in 1910 and sought to be employed by the Nigerian Railway Corporation. Fatima's great grand father was a blacksmith as well as a warrior who gave birth to Mamman Dazu, their grand father. Mamman Dazu is said to have been a great warrior and widely consulted. Birth Isa Amartey Amarteifio was converted to Islam upon getting to Zaria and met with Fatima after some years whom he married. Fatima was a widow and already had 3 children with Mohammadu Alao her then deceased husband. Their marriage was consummated with 6 children of whom Sawaba was the 5th.

It is built on a round hill, known as the Mama Sul, next to a Geodesic landmark. The Mama Lighthouse is about 4 km inland, northwest of Bel√©m, and combines with the Esteiro and Gibalta lighthouses to indicate the alignment of the southern entrance to the Port of Lisbon. History The entrance to Lisbon's port has for long been made difficult by a sandy bar in the River Tagus estuary. Until the 19th Century fishermen with a detailed knowledge of the river would provide piloting services to commercial shipping, with assistance from beacons lit on the neighbouring hills, including the Mama Sul. The first known reference to its use for navigation was in 1607, by which time it is believed that a building to serve as a marker had already been constructed. However, it is likely that the hill, without a building, had been used as a point of reference for many years before, possibly since the time of Roman occupation. Mama Lighthouse in Portugal, known locally as The Rocket of Carnaxide The current lighthouse is located about 4 km north-west of Bel√©m. It consists of a metal tripod with a lower gallery, together with a turret with an upper gallery and lantern. An external spiral staircase leads to the lower gallery. The building is 15 m tall and stands at an altitude of 145 metres. It is painted white, the staircase is red and the upper turret carries two red horizontal bands. The lighthouse resembles a rocket on a launching pad and, in fact, is known locally as the ‚Äúrocket of Carnaxide‚Äù. A directional flashlight Tideland RL 355, at a focal height of 82 metres, was fitted in 1995: prior to that it had no light. The lighthouse was renovated in 2013 to increase the range of the light to 24 nautical miles. It now includes a module that allows GPS synchronization of Mama with Esteiro and Gibalta lights. A web monitoring system has also been installed that allows real-time access to relevant information on the operating state of the light. Recent work has also aimed to raise the lighthouse, whose visibility was being compromised by the construction of tall buildings nearby.

Concept  The MAEX is an express S-train, and is designed to be routed from Munich's main railway station through the second main tunnel, on the current S8 train route East of the city, the Munich East-Munich Airport railway, to the airport. In addition to the two stops in the second main tunnel route, at the main station and Marienplatz, there will be an additional two stops at the Leuchtenbergring as well as in Unterf√∂hring and Ismaning. For the realization of this route, the four-track expansion of the Munich North Ring in the Daglfing-Johanneskirchen area is required in addition to the changes in the second main tunnel. This is to be done in the tunnel, in order to completely separate road traffic from the increasing railway traffic by eliminating the railroad transitions in Daglfing and Englschalking and, to protect the residential areas from noise and to eliminate the separation effect of the railway line. The journey time of the MAEX, on the approx. 35 km long stretch between Munich main station and airport therefore would reduce the current travel time by about 15 minutes. The total cost of the project is estimated at ‚Ç¨860 million, which includes the costs of further measures going beyond the MAEX. The MAEX costs alone are stated at ‚Ç¨625 million (not including the second main tunnel). Shortly after the publication of the project idea, Deutsche Bahn secured the trademark rights to MAEX.

Background In the evening of 9 April 1945, only a few days before the town's liberation by the Canadians, the local department of the national resistance organisation Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten (BS) received the order to start \\"sabotaging road, rail and water\\" to prevent German troops from escaping to Germany. BS member Broer Dijkstra and his sabotage group decided to prepare a disruption of the Leeuwarden-Franeker train line. In the night of 9 to 10 April, they removed the screws of 75 metres of railroad track, causing a Wehrmacht locomotive carrying 26 wagons to derail the night after. Within hours, the Sicherheitsdienst and the Sicherheitspolizei learned about the sabotage by a message from the town hall in Menaldum, intercepted and noted by the resistance as follows: :\\"At 23.30, in the night of 10 to 11 April, a Wehrmacht train consisting of one locomotive and 26 wagons derailed near a railroad bridge across the Bolswardertrekvaart, South of Dronrijp. The train left Leeuwarden for Franeker. Over a distance of 75 metres, screws were removed and ties were taken from the track. The locomotive is off the rails with two wagons behind it, and two other wagons lay on their sides. The wagons that were not derailed have been taken back to Leeuwarden. No personal accidents. Large amount of material damage.\\" Reprisals Gerard de Jong, right, the only survivor, with Ynse Postma, one of his rescuers, in 1955 The Sicherheitsdienst was furious and demanded the execution of 20 prisoners in Dronrijp the following day. A secret BS group in Leeuwarden intercepted the order and immediately positioned men near the sabotaged rail line, as they expected the prisoners to arrive by train. However, 14 prisoners from Leeuwarden were transported to Dronrijp in the back of a truck. As soon as they arrived, several British fighters overflew the town, causing the Sicherheitsdienst members to panic. Then they discovered that the bridge across the Van Harinxmakanaal was opened by the resistance, which blocked the road leading to the rail line. Now the only option was to guide the prisoners down next to the bridge to have them shot right there. One of the men, Gerard de Jong from Leeuwarden, survived the execution by pretending to be dead until the Germans had disappeared. People from the town, including Ynse Postma, rushed to the site and rescued him. De Jong‚Äôs luck was helped by the specific instruction from the Sicherheitsdienst for its men not to remove the bodies from the scene. Memorial Ynse Postma, at the memorial in 1955 Of the 13 prisoners who died that day, 11 were members of the resistance. Their names which are listed below are honoured at a memorial of 11 stone blocks that was built in 1949 at the location of the execution.

The building houses a shopping mall, a five-star hotel and commercial offices, as well as a concourse for YHT high-speed trains. Situated next to the Ankara railway station, the ATG terminal was built on the southern half of land used by the Ankara station, on the former site of two platforms serving commuter trains along with storage tracks. The building officially opened on 29 October 2016, on the 93rd anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey, along with Ankara station's high-speed platforms located underneath the structure. The building is owned by the Turkish State Railways (TCDD) and operated by a private company known as Ankara Tren Gar ƒ∞≈ületmesi A.≈û.. TCDD Ta≈üƒ±macƒ±lƒ±k uses the building for its ticket and information booths, waiting area and its VIP/CIP lounge. The building itself is tall with eight floors. History When construction works of the Ankara-Istanbul high- speed railway line commenced in 2004, plans for a new railway station in Ankara were put forth as part of a large-scale modernization of the railways in Turkey. In August 2005, Turkish State Railways (TCDD) awarded a joint bid of 946,155 YTL from the Sudop Praha AS ‚Äì SDPAK consortium to construct the ATG terminal. According to the original plan, the new station was going to encompass the entire existing station area like the new Eski≈üehir station. Construction of the new station was approved on 11 July 2007 by the Ankara city council. Plans for the new station were met with criticism from many architects, due to the fact that it would be demolishing several historic buildings within the grounds of the Ankara station. However, in 2008, plans for the station were halted when the Ankara 16th District Court overruled the city council's decision, citing that the project would endanger the historic structures at the Ankara station. The State Railways revised their plans for the station, and the new terminal was designed to encompass only the two southernmost platforms and adjacent yard tracks. These platforms were used by commuter trains to Sincan and Kaya≈ü and would have been replaced anyway, by the Ba≈ükentray project. On 28 August 2012, the bid for the revised station was awarded to a consortium consisting of Limak Holding, Kolin and Cengiz ƒ∞n≈üaat within a time-frame of 24 months. Using the build-operate-transfer model, the consortium will own and operate the station for 19 years and 7 months, until 2036. Construction started on 9 December 2013 with the demolition of the Ankara suburban platforms. The station structure was completed by May 2016 and was officially opened to passenger traffic on 29 October 2016, with a large ceremony that President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m and Minister of Transport Ahmet Arslan attended. Overview The construction of the YHT station was completed in two years. It was opened to service on 29 October 2016, on the 93rd anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic.

Their struggle led to chaos in Qi and the intervention of several outside powers, until Duke Huan's intended heir, Prince Zhao (later known as Duke Xiao), emerged victorious. Nevertheless, four of Prince Zhao's rival brothers remained at large and continued to conspire for the throne, leading to a succession crisis that plagued Qi for decades. As result, the succession war and its consequences greatly weakened Qi, which lost its status as China's predominant state.  Background  The state of Qi was a regionally powerful polity during the Western Zhou period (1046‚Äì771 BC), and as the Zhou dynasty's authority collapsed at the Spring and Autumn period's beginning, Qi grew into the dominating power of eastern China. As result, Qi was in an ideal position to expand its influence when Zheng's short-lived dominance over China declined. Nevertheless, Qi's development into China's predominant state was not just because of this favorable situation, but due to the efforts of two highly capable individuals: Duke Huan and his chancellor and advisor Guan Zhong. Under their leadership, Qi was reformed and became primus inter pares among the Chinese states, with Duke Huan rising to Hegemon of China. Toward the end of Huan's long reign (685‚Äì643 BC), however, Qi's dominance began to crumble. A military alliance led by Qi failed to stop the growth of the expansionist state of Chu, and even suffered defeat against it during the Battle of Loulin. Duke Huan's authority over the other states declined, a development accelerated by Guan Zhong's death in 645 BC. Having grown ill, the elderly duke also proved to be no longer able to keep the various political factions in his own realm under control. These factions were led by six of his sons: Zhao, Wukui, Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong. Since all of them were the children of different concubines instead of Duke Huan's three main wives (who bore him no sons), each of these six considered himself entitled to the throne. The officially designated heir was Prince Zhao, and Duke Huan and Guan Zhong even charged the ruler of neighboring Song, Duke Xiang to ensure his succession. With Guan Zhong's death and the old duke of Qi's health worsening, however, Wukui, Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong increasingly voiced their opposition to Zhao's position as designated heir. Their pleas to make one of them the next ruler failed to sway Duke Huan, but he could not prevent them from plotting against each other. In consequence, the brothers gathered followers and prepared for the inevitable showdown between them.  Civil war   Wukui's ascendancy and chaos  Duke Huan finally died in late 643 BC. According to the Guanzi and some other texts from the Warring States period, he was starved to death by four conspiring officials. Other notable sources for these events, such as the Zuo Zhuan and the Records of the Grand Historian, do not mention this. With the duke dead, the situation at the court escalated. The factions of crown prince Zhao and his rival brothers all took up arms against each other, and the capital city of Linzi descended into violent chaos. Wukui, however, had two powerful allies at the court: Diao, chief of the eunuchs, and Wu (also called Yiya), the chief cook. The Guanzi claims these two were among the conspirators who murdered Duke Huan. A party led by Diao and Wu managed to take control of the palace and murdered all rival officials they could capture; the other princes fled for their lives. On 11 November 643 BC, Wukui was crowned the new duke of Qi. Only then was the late Duke Huan finally encoffined; according to different accounts his corpse had laid unattended in his bedchamber for between seven days and three months due to the prevailing chaos, and already began to rot. Despite his coronation, however, Wukui's rule proved far from secure. While Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong all remained at large, it was Zhao who presented the greatest threat as he had fled to Duke Xiang of Song and asked for assistance. The ruler of Song promptly assembled an alliance against Wukui, consisting of Song, Cao, Wey, and Zou. The armies of these states, led by Duke Xiang and Prince Zhao, proceeded to invade Qi in March 642 BC. Wukui, on the other side, had won the support of the state of Lu, which sent an expeditionary army in order to aid him against the invaders. In the end, however, Wukui was murdered before the conflict could be decided on the battlefield. Growing fearful upon hearing about the Song-led invasion, the people of Qi revolted and put the usurper to death so that they could to welcome Prince Zhao as new duke.  Battle of Yan  As the news about Wukui's death spread, it was assumed that Zhao's ascendancy to throne had become inevitable, whereupon Cao, Wey and Lu withdrew their armies from Qi. In truth, however, the crown prince's position was not yet secured: As he was about to be enthroned by the people in the capital, Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong returned with their adherents and attacked his party. Thus, Zhao was again forced to escape from Linzi as his rival brothers took control of the government and formed an alliance against him. The crown prince fled to Duke Xiang of Song who still remained in Qi with his army, and requested his help. Meanwhile, the united army of the four brothers sallied forth from Linzi in order to drive the troops of Song from Qi. The two forces met on the battlefield at Yan (modern-day Licheng District, Jinan), where the army of Song won a decisive victory. The four brothers fled from Qi, while Duke Xiang of Song enthroned Zhao at Linzi; from then on, Zhao became known as Duke Xiao of Qi. With the succession war seemingly concluded, the army of Song returned home. Pan, Shangren, Yuan, and Yong were still active, however, and continued to conspire against the newly crowned duke. Soon after their defeat at Yan, the Beidi invaded and ravaged Qi, probably in order to aid the four brothers. This was not enough to weaken Duke Xiao, however, and Qi was restabilized. Soon after the Beidi attack, the situation had become calm enough for late Duke Huan to be finally buried with a proper ceremony, months after his death.  Aftermath  After his ascendancy to the throne, Duke Xiao attempted to restore Qi's former predominance in China. This led to a rift in his relationship with Duke Xiang of Song, as he too wanted to become hegemon. Though the two former allies even went to war over this issue, both failed in their efforts and Duke Wen of Jin became the next hegemon. Duke Xiao's line would also not last on Qi's throne, as his son and heir was murdered. The succession crisis thus continued until Prince Yuan took the throne in 608 BC. His descendants would rule Qi until 386 BC, when they were toppled by the Tian clan.

Currently, private funding of research accounts for the majority of all research and development funding in the United States as of 2007 overall.https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/82xx/doc8221/06-18-research.pdf Overall, Federal and Industrial sources contribute similar amounts to research, while industry funds the vast majority of development work. While the majority of industry research is performed in-house, a major portion of this private research funding is directed to research in non-profit academic centers. As of 1999, industrial sources accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion of academic research funding in the US. However, there is little governmental oversight or tracking of industry funding on academic science and figures of the scale of industry research are often estimated by self- reporting and surveys which can be somewhat unreliable. Much of this industry funding of academic research is directed toward applied research. However, by some accounts, industry may even fund up to 40% of basic research in the United States, with Federal funding of basic research falling below 50%, although this figure does not consider where this research is conducted. The role for funding of academic research from industrial sources has received much attention both in a historical and contemporary perspective. The practice has received both extensive political praise and scholarly criticism. History Research in the US prior to World War II, heavily relied on funding from private sources without major organized federal research programs or either the scientists‚Äô or associates‚Äô personal funds. During World Wa ~~r~~ II, governmental investment in research was widely regarded as a major contributor to military success and support for research was politically favorable.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235736/ Following WW2, federal research funding in both Europe and the US increased in terms of relative percent of funding for research and absolute amount. Overall, the growth of industrial research funding has greatly outpaced public research funding growth, with US governmental research funding increasing by an average of 3.4% annually, while industrial research funding increased by an average of 5.4% annually from 1950 to 2004. Since WW2, industry funding of science has consistently represented the second largest source of funding for academic science. Industry funding of academic science did expand during the 1980s and 1990s following the passing of the Bayh-Dole Act and a variety of both State and Federal proposals to increase funding for joint industry academic partnerships. In the 2000s there has been a small retraction of industry funding for academic science while overall industry R&D; funding has expanded. ). However, industry funding may be broadening its scope as industry funding of basic science increasing dramatically over that same period, but much of this funding remains in-house. Culturally, attitudes towards the industrial funding of academic research have changed over time. Within universities, commercial activities and industry funding were often spurned in the 19th century. More recently, commercializing scientific activity is viewed more favorably with extensive political and university support of translating scientific discovery into economic output. However, within the research community and the public, industrial funding of research remains controversial. The universality of this tangled industry, academic, and governmental exchange of funding and research adventures has led researchers to term this model of R&D; the Triple Helix. Types of industrially funded academic research  University-industry partnerships can take on a variety of forms. On the smallest scale, individual research labs or researchers can partner with industry sources for funding. The details of such partnerships can differ substantially with any number of motives ranging from the academic lab testing of previously developed products, to performing early stage basic research related to industry research objectives, or even to individual researchers supporting their salary by consulting on related research problems in industry.https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3500 While many such partnerships exist, due to their informal nature and resulting lack of record, it is difficult to track how extensive and impactful such relationships are, with most relying on surveys and other self-reporting measures. By closest approximation, according to the Research Value Mapping Survey, 17% of academics at major US research universities report receive grants from industry sources supporting their research. Far more extensively, in many fields and countries, a narrow majority of academic scientists report having some soft industry relationships, primarily through consulting. Such informal industry academic relationships have a long-standing tradition as they served as a major source of funding for individual labs prior to WW2. In many cases, it was expected that researchers would pursue such relationships as this was expected to be a major source of funding for researcher‚Äôs salaries. Despite greatly expanded post-WW2 federal support for research, so called soft money salary support from industry remains a large and growing aspect of academic research salaries.  University Industry Research Centers (UIRCs)  On a larger scale, there have been numerous attempts to create collaborative University- Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) to jointly host academic and industry researchers to address industry problems with direct, large scale collaborative centers. Early forms of UIRCS started in the 1950s and 1960s with the formation of research parks with industry sponsors. In the 1970s, there were multiple proposals at the federal level in the US to help fund and expand early UIRCs. However, funding fell through at multiple points.https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9619.html The first UIRCs experienced difficulties in bridging the differences between academic and industrial culture. One such attempt occurred at Cal Tech where Cal Tech researchers partnered with Xerox and IBM through the Silicon Structures Project.https://archive.org/details/capsca_000202 Both industry and academic partners were concerned about the cultures of the other and found the structure ineffective. With such frustrations, it was difficult to secure partners to continue expanding UIRCs. In the late 1970s, RPI created two three new UIRCs: 1) the Center for Integrated Computer Graphics, which received both NSF and industry support 2) the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology Transfer, which was funded entirely by industry support and 3) the Center for Integrated Electronics, which received unprecedented industry support. These centers were generally regarded as highly successful and made expansion of governmental support for joint industry and academic ventures more favorable. In the early 1980s, states began contributing funding to UIRCs and other industry-academic partnerships to encourage local economic growth from innovation. By the mid-1980s, the federal government expanded financial support for UIRCs. With mixed governmental and industry support, the UIRCs were more likely to be successful. Over time successful governmentally funded UIRCs could become independent from government support once having demonstrable successes that could continue to incentivize industry to contribute funding more aggressively. UIRCs, coupled to early seeding from both state and federal government, continued to greatly expand during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually receiving nearly 70% of industry funding of academic research and incentivizing a tripling of industry funding of academic research during the 1980s.  Contract Research Organizations (CROs)  Contract research has also drawn increasing industry funding, particularly to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) from Biotech and Pharmaceutical corporations. Contract research is a popular form of outsourcing research in industry as industry has more influence over how the study is conducted than in either UIRCs or traditional academic grants. CROs, which are specifically designed for this function have drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away from academia and are growing rapidly. Influence and criticisms Much discussion has been placed on the effects of industrial research funding on the behavior of academic research scientists. Concerns center on whether researchers can remain impartial when they are being funded by a for-profit and potentially motivated industrial source, if this funding gives private sources an oversized impact on which research directions are pursued, and the potential negative effects of industrial funding on the openness of science. A multitude of studies have found that pharmaceutical studies funded by industry organizations are significantly more likely to publish results in favor of the product being supported. This could, in part, be due to the fact that usually when an academic accepts industry funding, particularly when working on an existing product, researchers have to sign non-disclosure agreements which often prevent the publication of negative results and inhibit the openness of science.https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public- universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/ This could serve to significantly bias scientific results and diminish public trust of science. There are additionally many scholars who have considered advantages of industrially funded academic research. Generally, increased industry funding may increase academic and industry interaction, prompting greater efficiency in translating and commercializing of science research. This increased commercialization activity from academics could serve as an economic and societal boost as the economy could be bolstered by new products hitting the market, while society could benefit directly from having increased access to the fruits of scientific production. Supporting this, academic science funded by industry sources does result in more patents per dollar, increased licensing of these patents, and even more citations per published paper than research supported by other sources, including federal at the University of California Berkeley. In Germany, it also appears that applied research funded by industry sources results in a significant increase in patent citations, which could correspond to a serious increase in translation of applied research. Such increase in commercialization and translation of research could provide social and economic benefits. However, it is difficult to determine whether this increase in apparent impact is due to the industry funding itself or is just a read out that industry funds target work that tends to produce more citations per publication as well as more patents.

Until recently, the building had operated as a specialty nursing home for patients with HIV/AIDS. The building featured in the media for the way city officials handled the sale of the property. In 2015, VillageCare and a small group of nursing home owners applied to lift the deed restriction on the building, allowing it to be transformed from an AIDS nursing home into a residential or commercial property. When the building was ultimately sold for $116 million, Mayor Bill de Blasio drew criticism for straying from his policy to increase affordable housing in the city. The building was eventually reclassified and sold to China Vanke Co., Adam America Real Estate, and Slate Property Group for residential development. Background Rivington House operated as a HIV/AIDS nursing home from 1995 until 2015. The lack of patients and the change in community care for people with HIV led VillageCare to announce in 2014 that they would be closing the facility in Manhattan. As local press reported at the time, ‚Äúthe need for a single-purpose skilled nursing facility like Rivington House that segregates AIDS patients is long past.\\" By 2015, Rivington House was non-performing and nearly vacant, and a nursing home operator in the region called The Allure Group purchased the building. Within the first year under new ownership, the building featured in the New York City press after an application was made to change the property's deed restrictions. Its restrictive deed prevented the property from being developed like many of the buildings in the same district, stating that the building had to be used for non-profit residential health care. Following the required payment to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, as determined by the city, the building's deed restriction was lifted, and The Allure Group sold the building for $116 million to a developer. While sales of this value are common in New York City, the media honed in on Mayor Bill de Blasio for moving away from his policy of providing affordable housing. Ricardo Morales, a deputy commissioner at the Citywide Department of Administrative Services was eventually relieved of his duties following the sale of Rivington House. More information about the deal entered the media in 2016, when Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested he didn't know about the land deal, prior to signing off on the lifting of the deed restriction. The statement made by Bill de Blasio was questioned following the release of a report by the New York City Department of Investigation. The report suggested that while many city officials denied knowing about the details of the deal, they were in fact fully aware of what was taking place. The NY Post reported that Bill de Blasio's administration offered millions of dollars the month prior, in February 2016, to effectively undo the deal as it would reflect badly on the administration. The report stated that both The Allure Group and the city wanted to reclassify the building, and both parties knew a $17 million fee was needed specifically to remove the deed restriction. The report also showed that the city understood any fees would result in the nursing home being flipped by The Allure Group, as the property was no longer viable in its current position. The New York Times and NY Post made similar remarks to the report, referring to a meeting on March 11, 2015. If a $16.15 million payment was required to lift the deed restriction it ‚Äúcould not afford to pay the cost to remove the deed restriction and retain the property as a nursing home,‚Äù and ‚Äúwould consider converting the property into a luxury apartment building and forgo the nursing home renovation.‚Äù The city of New York opened an investigation into what had gone wrong with their management of the situation. However, the probe found no illegal conduct. The city announced they could not sue The Allure Group, as legally they had not done anything wrong and determined instead that there was a need to revamp its own internal policies and procedures. Despite the controversy caused by the sale and removing the deed restriction from Rivington House, the state legislators decided to reject a bill aimed at preventing similar sales from taking place in the future.

As a two-year-old in 1983 he won a minor race on his debut and then recorded whis biggest win in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. He was unplaced in his only other start that season and made little impact in three subsequent races over the next two years. After his retirement he had some success as a sire of National Hunt horses. Background King Persian was a chestnut horse bred in Ireland by the Oldtown Stud. He was a very late foal, being born on 14 une, meaning that he was younger than the vast majority of horses of his generation. As a yearling he was put up for auction and sold or 29,000 guineas. During his racing career he was owned by Seamus McAleer and trained in Ireland by Liam Browne. His sire, Persian Bold was a successful racehorse who won the Richmond Stakes in 1977. He went on to be a \\"good\\" stallion, getting important winners such as Kooyonga, Bold Pilot, Persian Heights, Falcon Flight (Prix Hocquart) and Bold Russian (Celebration Mile). King Persian's dam Naiad Queen was a minor winner and a half-sister to the dam of Just A Game. She was distantly descended from the Irish broodmare Garganey, who was the female-line ancestor of Brown Jack, Cavan and Indiana. Racing career 1983: two-year-old season King Persian made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs of firm ground at Gowran Park in July and won easily. In the following month he was stepped up in class and started at odds of 8/1 in a thirteen-runner field for the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse. The favourite for the race was Gala Event, a filly who was unbeaten in two previous starts, but the rest of the field was undistinguished by Group 1 standards. Ridden by Michael Kinane, King Persian stumbled exiting the starting stalls and settled towards the rear of the field as Gala Event set a very fast pace. The colt produced a very strong finish, caught Grey Dream in the final strides and won by a short head. Racing on softer ground at the Curragh on 10 September King Persian started second favourite for the National Stakes but finished fifth of the eight runners behind El Gran Senor. At the end of the season, the independent Timeform organisation gave King Persian a rating of 104, making him 27 pounds inferior to El Gran Senor, who was their best two-year-old. In the Irish Free Handicap he was rated 17 pounds behind El Gran Senor, making him the sixth best Irish- trained colt of his generation. 1984 & 1985: three and four-year-old seasons In 1984 King Persian was off the course until August when he returned after an eleven-month absence in a handicap over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. Carrying a weight of 134 pounds he finished sixth behind the filly Late Sally. Later that month the colt was given a radically different assignment when he was sent to England to contest the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes over one and a half miles at York and finished fifth behind Rainbow Quest. He did not run again that year. Timeform gave him a rating of 107 ?, the \\"?\\" indicating that they felt there wa insufficient evidence for the rating to be considered accurate. King Persian remained in training as a four-year-old in 1985 but ran only once, finishing fourth to Kamakura in the Royal Whip Stakes. Stud record At the end of his racing career, King Persian was retired to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. He sired a few minor winners on the flat but was more successful as a National Hunt stallion, with the best of his offspring being the Topham Chase winner Cregg House.

Name Traditionally the people now called Dalabon had no collective name for themselves, and the term itself derives from the language which members of the community speak. Language The Dalabon language is classified among the far East Arnhem Land language group, and as belonging to the Gunwinyguan language family. It is under severe threat of extinction. One feature of its linguistic culture, the relative absence of nouns for emotions, combined with its rich repertoire (160 lexemes) of emotional verbs and adjectives has recently attracted the attention of scholars Country By the time of the advent of colonialism, the Dalabon's tribal territory is thought to have covered some , in south-western Arnhem Land. Norman Tindale placed their northern boundary at the upper Goyder River, and their heartland around the headwaters of the Phelp, Rose and Hart rivers. Ma√Øa Ponsonnet states that before the colonial period they were located in Central Arnhem Land with clan estates extending further north in the direction of the Arafura Sea. Their immediate tribal environment consisted of several peoples: the Jawoyn to their southwest, Kune and Mayali speakers of the Bininj Gun-Wok dialect chain on their west-north western boundaries, the Ngalakgan on their southern frontier and the Rembarrnga beyond their eastern limits. Lifestyle The Dalabon were semi-nomadic hunter gatherers, with access to abundant food resources culled throughout a mixed savannah and forest area which experienced three seasonal changes: a humid wet monsoonal period from December to April, followed by three cool dry months (May to July), and closing with the gradual onset of warming from August to November as a prelude to the return of the rainy summer season. Social organization Dalabon society had 8 subsections, each of which had a male and female name, and which can be analysed in terms of three dichotomies. The first taxonomy identifies people in terms of patrimoieties of the Dua/Yirritja type. A second division of descent is matrilineal; the intersection of these two forms 4 sections. A third system has subsections to elicit the ideal father-and-son pairs. The structure of these moieties and semi-moieties affects the ritual choreography of two major ceremonies, Gunabibi and Yabuduruwa, held on alternating years by the Dalabon and some contiguous tribes. Mythology In the earliest times, according to Dalabon cosmology, men passed the night-time under water, and had stumps for legs. The crocodile was master of the secret of fire. This changed when the kingfisher managed to filch a firebrand from the crocodile, and set fire to the landscape, and men were burnt, leading them to learn the art of cooking and also acquire the legs they now have. Two pairs of immemorial, ancestral people (Nayunghyungkig), the Yirritja men Bulanj and Kodjok, and the Duwa women Kalidjan and Kamanj, -collectively referred to as the Nakoorkko - wandered the earth, laying down the law (walu-no) inscribed in the nature of the Dalabon landscape and its reflex in Dalabon social customs. Modern times The Dalabon today mainly live in an area east of Katherine, in Wugularr (formerly Beswick), Barunga (formerly Bamyili), Bulman and Weemol. Customs Kenneth Maddock found the Dalabon still preserved a custom, which they called magard, which had been briefly noted earlier among the Yolgnu and the Burarra, and called Mirriri, according to which a man whose classificatory sister had been subject to obscene abuse implying she was engaged in sexual improprieties, was obliged to assault her, armed with a spear, boomerang or sticks. W. Lloyd Warner took the practice as a ritual expression of displeasure performed to allay the outbreak of hostilities between the respective clans of husband and wife; Lester Hiatt thought his material suggested rather a brother's disavowal of incestuous interest in his sister; Maddock took the Dalabon custom as a predictable ceremonial affirmation of a social relation forming part of a larger body of tribal etiquette. Ethnographic studies Kenneth Maddock did the first comprehensive studies of the Dalabon. Alternative names * Buan, Bu:wan, Boun * Ngalkbon Tindale's Dangbon Norman Tindale posited the existence of a 'tribe', the Dangbon whom he considered distinct from the Dalabon, but was unable to furnish an estimate for their tribal lands, other than locating these Dangbon to the east of the Liverpool River's headwaters and at those of the Cadell and Mann rivers. He also provided a list of alternative names for this group: * Gundangbon * Dangbun * Dangbar. (typo) * Gumauwurk Contemporary scholarship now regards Dangbon as an alternative name for the Dalabon.

M. Pei for the businessman Henry Keswick and his wife Tessa Keswick at Oare House in Oare, Wiltshire. It was completed in 2003 and is Pei's only building in the United Kingdom. The pavilion was the recipient of an award from the Georgian Society for a new building in a Georgian context. Pei was designing the Suzhou Museum in China at the time of his commission by the Keswicks for the Oare Pavilion. Keswick's ancestors had also been acquainted with Pei's father, a banker. The Keswicks wished for an \\"airy garden pavilion for family activities and guests\\" that would provide a focal point in the landscape surrounding Oare House. Pei subsequently received the RIBA Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2010. In a 2010 profile of Pei written by Paula Deitz for the Architects Journal, described the Oare Pavilion in the context of its surrounding landscape as \\"In lieu of an 18th-century folly, the Oare Pavilion is updated 21st-century chinoiserie, a raised octagonal glass structure with a two-tiered, pagoda-style roof on a white concrete foundation...\\". Deitz sees the pavilion as a \\"sister to the performance pavilion in the lotus pond at the Suzhou Museum. And, like the museum, light filters through thin wooden slats on the interior of the slanted glass walls\\" and concludes that the Oare Pavilion is \\"...one of his best ‚Äì a fulfillment of a lifetime aesthetic\\". The pavilion was featured in the 2008 book Follies of Europe: Architectural Extravaganzas where it was described as possessing \\"proud confidence and advanced technical capabilities\\". It is visible from the North Wessex Downs. Photographs of the pavilion by Morley von Sternberg are in the collection of the British Architectural Library. Von Sternberg described the pavilion as \\"...geometrically formal, but is in fact an incredibly relaxing place to be\\" in a 2014 interview. The cloakrooms, kitchen, and furniture in the pavilion was designed by John Stefanidis. References External links *Oare Tea House Pavilion at Perry Y. Chin *The Oare Pavilion at Leslie E.

Together with her younger sister Aurora, she was one of the earliest recognized female painters not only in Chile but in the whole of Latin America. She was also one of the earliest women to study art at the Santiago School of Painting. Biography Born in Santiago in 1859, Mira was the daughter of the painter Gregorio Mira I√±iguez and his wife Mercedes Mena Alviz. Raised in a well-to-do environment, she was introduced to painting by her father who had studied under the French painter Raymond Monvoisin, the first director of the Chilean School of Painting. She went on to study under the school's third director Juan Mochi and the sculptor Jos√© Miguel Blanco (1839‚Äì1897) at a time when it was quite unusual for women to undertake formal art studies. As a painter, she worked with oils, creating portraits, usually in profile, which were warmly depicted with a good understanding of her subjects. Often prepared for display in an oval frame, her portraits exhibit a fine appreciation of form and excellent technical execution. One of her finest works, La Viuda (The Widow), is enhanced by careful representation of the details surrounding the subject. At a time when it was unusual for women to paint professionally, Chilean society was taken aback when the two sisters began to exhibit in the salon of the Museum of Fine Arts in the 1880s under Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda's presidency. Competing with such established artists as Pedro Lira, Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez and Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma, Magdalena was awarded the Salon's Gold Medal in 1884. Magdalena Mira exhibited her paintings at the Sal√≥n Oficial from 1883 to 1897. A number of her works can be seen in the collections of Chile's Museo National de Bellas Artes.

During his reign, the Marathas under Shivaji raided Surat (1666) and their incursions in Gujarat started. Till then Gujarat prospered due to political stability, peace and growing international trade. During the next three emperors (1707‚Äì1719) who had brief reigns, the nobles became more and more powerful due to instability in the Delhi. The royals of Marwar were appointed viceroys frequently. During the reign of the emperor Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748), the struggle between the Mughal and Maratha nobles were heightened with frequent battles and incursions. The south Gujarat was lost to the Marathas and the towns in north and central Gujarat was attacked on several occasions with frequent demand of tributes. The Marathas continued to grow their hold and the frequent change of viceroys did not reverse the trend. The competing houses of Marathas, Gaikwars and Peshwas engaged between themselves which slow down their progress for a while. They later made peace between themselves. During the reign of the next emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1748‚Äì1754), there was nominal control over the nobles who acted on their own. There were frequent fights between themselves and with Marathas. Ahmedabad, the capital of province, finally fell to the Marathas in 1752. It was regained by noble Momin Khan for a short time but again lost to the Marathas in 1756 after a long siege. Finding opportunity, the British captured Surat in 1759. After a setback at Panipat in 1761, the Marathas strengthened their hold on Gujarat. During this fifty years, the power struggle between the Mughal nobles and Marathas caused disorder and the decline in prosperity. Background Gujarat under Humayun (1535‚Äì1536) About end of 1532, Gujarat Sultan Bahadur Shah had a quarrelled with Humayun, the Mughal emperor of Delhi. The original ground of quarrel was that Bah√°dur Sh√°h had sheltered Sult√°n Muhammad Zam√°n M√≠rza, the grandson of a daughter of the emperor Babar (1482‚Äì1530). Hum√°y√∫n‚Äôs anger was increased by an insolent answer from Bahadur Shah. Without considering that he had provoked a powerful enemy, Bah√°dur Sh√°h again laid siege to Chittor, and though he heard that Hum√°y√∫n had arrived at Gwalior, he would not desist from the siege. In March 1535, Chittor fell into the hands of the Bahadur Shah but near Mandas√∫r his army was shortly afterwards routed by Hum√°y√∫n. Bah√°dur Sh√°h fled to Mandu, which fortress was speedily taken by Hum√°y√∫n. From M√°ndu the king fled to Ch√°mp√°ner, and finally took refuge in Diu. Ch√°mp√°ner fell to Hum√°y√∫n, and the whole of Gujar√°t, except Sorath, came under his rule. At this time Sher Sh√°h S√∫r revolted, in Bihar and Jaunpur, and Hum√°y√∫n returned to Agra. As soon as Hum√°y√∫n departed, the country rose against the Mughals, and his old nobles requested the king to join them. Bah√°dur joined them, and, defeating the Mughals at Kan√≠j village near Mahm√∫d√°b√°d (now Mahemdavad), expelled them from Gujar√°t. As Gujarat fell to the Mughal Empire, Bahadur Shah was forced to court the Portuguese. On 23 December 1534 while on board the galleon St. Mattheus he signed the Treaty of Bassein. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the city of Bassein (Vasai), as well as its territories, islands, and seas which included Daman and Bombay islands too. He had granted them leave to erect a factory in Diu. Instead of a factory the Portuguese built a Diu Fort. When he recovered his kingdom, Bahadur, repenting of his alliance with the Portuguese, went to Sorath to persuade an army of Portuguese, whom he had asked to come to his assistance, to return to Goa. In February 1537, when the Portuguese arrived at Diu, five or six thousand strong, the Sult√°n hoping to get rid of them by stratagem, went to Diu and endeavored to get the viceroy into his power. The viceroy excused himself, and in return invited the king to visit his ship anchored off the coast of Gujarat. Bah√°dur agreed, and on his way back was attacked and killed the Portuguese and his body was dumped into the Arabian Sea.The Cambridge history of the British Empire, Volume 2 by Arthur Percival Newton p.14 After his death, Gujarat started facing pressure of Mughals in north and other kingdoms from east. They also faced growing economic competition in Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean from the Europeans. Under Mughal Empire (1573‚Äì1756) Under Akbar (1573‚Äì1605) In 1573, Mughal Emperor Akbar conquered Gujarat Sultanate (now Gujarat, India) taking advantage of young Gujarat Sultan Muzaffar Shah III and his quarrelling nobles. Muzaffar was held captive at Agra. He appointed his foster brother M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh as the first viceroy who faced an insurrection by the rebel nobles of the former Sultanate. Akbar quickly came to aid and ended the insurrection. He soon appointed Mirza Khan who managed to set revenue system and quelled attack by the Mirzas with help of Mughal minister Todar Mal. The next viceroy Shah√°b-ud-d√≠n strengthened the military. Soon Sultan Muzaffar escaped, returned to Gujarat and led an attack on Ahmedabad and recaptured it before his former noble and now viceroy Itimad Khan reached the city. Soon Mirza Khan was reappointed as the viceroy who defeated Muzaffar in the battle of Fatehwadi in 1584. Soon Kokalt√°sh returned as the viceroy and defeated Muzaffar and combined Kathiawad forces in battle of Bhuchar Mori. Later Muzaffar was captured but he committed suicide, putting an end to the Gujarat Sultanate. As Kokalt√°sh went to the Mecca on pilgrimage, Sultan Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy on whose death, Kokalt√°sh returned a third time as the viceroy. Akbar was succeeded by Jehangir. Under Jehangir (1605‚Äì1627) Jehangir continued M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh as the viceroy when he ascended to the throne in 1605. He continued to manage the province even though Khalij Khan was appointed as the new viceroy. He was succeeded by Sayad Murtaza who controlled the rebellions in north and south Gujarat. M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh again returned as the viceroy and successfully averted invasion of Malik Ambar from Daulatabad in south. The next viceroy Abdull√°h Kh√°n F√≠r√∫z Jang made expedition to south and subdued the Ahmednagar. During his time, in 1611, Jehangir permitted the British East India Company to establish factories in Surat and elsewhere in Gujarat. During reign of the next viceroy Mukarrab Kh√°n, Jehangir toured Gujarat and received several local rulers. In 1618, he appointed his son prince Shah Jahan as the next viceroy. He rebelled in 1622-23 and he was replaced by Sult√°n D√°war Baksh. Shah Jahan resisted but later he managed the Jehangir's new appointment, Kh√°n Jah√°n as his own. Saif Khan had managed the province instead as Khan Jahan was sent as Shah Jahan's ambassador to Jehangir. Jehangir died and Shah Jahan succeeded him as the emperor in 1627. Under Shah Jahan (1627‚Äì1658) On the death of the emperor Jehangir, his son Shah Jahan ascended to the throne in 1627. His Gujarat viceroy Sher Kh√°n T√∫ar worked for relief in 1631‚Äì31 famine in the province. Shah Jahan sent his men to expand its territories further south. Between 1632 and 1635, four viceroys were appointed due to their precious gift to the emperor and they could not manage the province well. Kolis of Kankrej in north Gujarat committed excesses and the Jam of Nawanagar did not pay the tribute. Soon Azam Khan was appointed who put the province in order by subdueing Kolis in north and Kathis in Kathiawad. He also made the Jam of Nawanagar surrender. The next viceroy √çsa Tarkh√°n carried out financial reforms. In 1644, the Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed as the viceroy who was engaged in religious disputes for destroying a Jain temple in Ahmedabad. Due to his disputes, he was replaced by Sh√°istah Kh√°n who failed to subdue Kolis. So the prince Murad Bakhsh was appointed as the viceroy in 1654. He restored the disorder soon. In 1657, hearing news of Shah Jahan's severe illness, Murad Bakhsh declared himself the emperor and rebelled with his brother Aurangzeb. They defeated the Jaswant Singh and K√°sam Kh√°n, whom Sh√°h Jah√°n had appointed viceroys of M√°lwa and Gujar√°t respectively in the battle of Dharmatpur. They further went to the capital, Agra but were confronted by Dara Shikoh. They defeated him in the Battle of Samugarh (1658). Soon Aurangzed dumped and imprisoned Murad Bakhsh, confined his father and declared himself the emperor in 1658. Under Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707) After defeating all his brothers, Aurangzeb ascended the Mughal throne in 1658. He rewarded people who had helped him in his succession war. He forgave Jaswant Singh with whom he had fought in the battle and appointed him as the viceroy of Gujarat. Mahabat Khan succeeded him who annexed Nawanagar under the Mughal control. During his time, Aurangzeb decreed some administrative reforms, ordered curbs on Hindu customs and festivals and enforced Islamic religious law. In 1664, Maratha leader Shivaji plundered Surat and emptied its riches. Under next viceroy Khan Jehan, Shivaji again attacked Surat and Janjira. Jaswant Singh was appointed the viceroy again and the Nawanagar was partially restored to its ruler. During the next viceroy Amin Khan, there was disorder in the province due to the imposition of jizya tax and other discrimination and Idar revolted in 1679 but soon contained. During next viceroy, Mukhtar Khan, Ahmedabad faced flood (1683) and the province faced the famine (1684). Sujaat Khan, the next viceroy, managed the province for nineteen years. he contained revolt of Shia Muslims in 1691 and disturbances in Kathiawad and Marwar. He made peace with Durgadas Rathod of Marwar. In 1698, Gujarat again faced scarcity. In 1703, Prince Muhammad Azam Shah was appointed as the viceroy. Durgadas was invited to Ahmedabad to be killed but he escaped. In south, the Marathas assembled and threatened to enter Gujarat. Soon they entered under Dhanaji Jadhav up to Bharuch during the rule of the next viceroy Ibrahim Khan. Under him, the Mughal forces were defeated at Ratanpur near Rajpipla and again at Baba Pyara and plundered the whole region. The emperor sent prince Muhammad Bidar Bakht with forces to help but the Marathas returned before he arrived. On the other hand, Durgadas again rebelled and sent forces but he was defeated. Ibrahim Khan soon reappointed as the viceroy just before death of Aurangzeb in 1707. Taking advantage of situation due to warring princes for succession, the Marathas under Balaji Vishwanath entered Gujarat and reached as far as Ahmedabad. Fearing heavy plunder, Ibrahim Khan negotiated and paid a heavy tribute of Rupees 210,000 to withdraw. Thus Marathas returned. Bahadur Shah I ascended the Mughal throne in Delhi. During Aurangzeb's rule, the Mughal Empire had weakened and started falling apart. Under Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712) =Gh√°zi-ud-d√≠n, Forty-third Viceroy, 1708‚Äì1710= In 1708, in consequence of last viceroy Ibr√°h√≠m Kh√°n‚Äôs resignation, Gh√°zi-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n Bah√°dur F√≠r√∫z Jang was appointed forty-third viceroy of Gujar√°t. The leaning of the new emperor towards Shia tenets and his order to insert in the Friday sermon the words the lawful successor of the Prophet after the name of Ali, the fourth Khal√≠fah, besides giving general dissatisfaction, caused a small disturbance in √Åhmed√°b√°d. On the first Friday on which the sermon was read the T√∫r√°ni or Turk soldiers publicly called on the preacher to desist on pain of death. The preacher disregarding their threats on the next Friday was pulled down from the pulpit by the T√∫r√°nis and brained with a mace. In the same year (1708), hearing that the representative of Sh√°hi √Ålam had a copy of a Quran written by the Im√°m √Åli Taki, son of M√∫sa Raz√° (810‚Äì829), the emperor expressed a wish to obtain a sight of it, and the viceroy sent it to him at M√°ndu in charge of Sayad √Çkil and Sal√°bat Kh√°n B√°bi. In 1709, Shari√¢t Kh√°n, brother of Abd√∫l Ham√≠d Kh√°n, was appointed minister in place of his brother, who obtained the office of chief K√°zi. Much treasure was sent to the imperial camp by order of the emperor. Aj√≠tsingh of M√°rw√°r now rebelled and recovered Jodhpur. As the emperor wished to visit Ajmer, the viceroy of Gujar√°t was directed to join him with his army. At this time the pay of a horseman is said to have been Rupees 34 and of a footman Rupees 4 a month. During his administration, F√≠r√∫z Jang introduced the practice, which his successors continued, of levying taxes on grain piece-goods and garden produce on his own account, the viceroy‚Äôs men by degrees getting into their hands the whole power of collecting. In 1710, when on tour exacting tribute, the viceroy fell ill at Danta and was brought to √Åhmed√°b√°d, where he died. As F√≠r√∫z Jang had not submitted satisfactory accounts, his property was confiscated, and in 1711 Am√°nat Kh√°n, governor of Surat, was appointed deputy viceroy with the title of Shah√°mat Kh√°n. When Shah√°mat Kh√°n was levying tribute from the Kadi and Vijapur districts, he heard that a Mar√°tha force had advanced to the B√°ba Pyara ford on the Narmada river. He at once marched to oppose them, summoning Sayad √Åhmed G√≠l√°ni, governor of Sorath, to his assistance. When he reached Ankleshwar, the Mar√°th√°s met him, and a battle was fought in which the Mar√°th√°s were defeated. Shah√°mat Kh√°n then proceeded to Surat, and, after providing for its safety returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In spite of their reverse at Ankleshwar, the Mar√°th√°s from this time began to make yearly raids into Gujar√°t.  Under Jahandar Shah (1712‚Äì1713) =√Åsif-ud-Daulah, Forty-fourth Viceroy, 1712‚Äì13= In 1712, the emperor died, and was succeeded by his son Jahandar Shah, and √Åsif-ud-daulah Asad Kh√°n Bah√°dur was appointed forty-fourth viceroy of Gujar√°t. As Muhammad Beg Kh√°n, who was then at Kharkol, was a favourite of the new viceroy and through his interest was appointed deputy, he went to √Åhmed√°b√°d, and Shah√°mat Kh√°n was transferred to M√°lwa as viceroy. In the meantime, Muhammad Beg Kh√°n was appointed governor of Surat, and Sarbuland Kh√°n Bah√°dur was sent to √Åhmed√°b√°d as deputy viceroy. On his way to Gujar√°t, Sarbuland Kh√°n was robbed in the S√°gb√°ra wilds to the east of R√°jp√≠pla. On his arrival he promptly marched against the rebellious Kolis of the Chunv√°l and subdued them. At the end of the year, as Farrukhsiyar, son of √Åz√≠m-us-Sh√°n, second son of the late emperor, was marching with a large army on the capital, Sarbuland Kh√°n returned to Delhi. Under Farrukhsiyar (1713‚Äì1719) This expedition of Farrukhsiyar was successful. He put Jahandar Shah to death and mounted the throne in 1713. As he had been raised to the throne mainly by the aid of Sayads Husain √Åli and Abdullah Kh√°n, the new emperor fell under the power of these nobles. He concluded treaty with Ajitsingh of Jodhpur. Daud Khan Panni, the powerful general, was appointed as the viceroy but there were riots in Ahmedabad in 1714. Ajitsingh was appointed as the next viceroy who had disputes with other noble Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n. After some reluctance, Ajitsingh let Kh√°n Daur√°n Nasrat Jang Bah√°dur to be appointed as the next viceroy. In 1719, the emperor Farrukhsiyar was deposed by influential Sayad brothers in 1719. Under Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748) Farrukhsiyar was succeeded by the short reigns of Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II. Finally Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne by them. To make peace with powerful vassal, he appointed Aj√≠tsingh of M√°rw√°r as a viceroy. The Maratha incursions continued and P√≠l√°ji G√°ikw√°r established himself at Songad near southern border of Gujarat. Ajit Singh had appointed Anopsingh Bhandari as his deputy. For helping to depose the influential Sayad brothers, Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n was appointed the next viceroy. People discontent with Anopsingh rejoiced his appointment but he tried to make himself free so he was recalled. Niz√°m-ul-Mulk took over who had to face the Maratha incursion again. The Marathas taking advantage of weakening Mughal Empire started extracting tribute from Gujarat regularly. The next viceroy Sarbuland Khan came in conflict with the Marathas whose generals were first defeated at Kapadvanj and again at Aras. The infighting in Marathas later stalled their advances. The imperial troops were sent by the emperor to help. Finally, the Marathas were defeated at Sojitra and Kapadvanj and pushed back from their inroads in Gujarat. In subsequent years, the Marathas attacked Vadnagar and later captured Baroda, Dabhoi and Champaner. The growing power of Marathas in southern Gujarat can not be contained. In 1730, Abheysingh was appointed as the viceroy who defeated Mub√°riz-ul-Mulk at Adalaj who has opposed his appointment. He soon allied with Maratha Peshwa and defeated another Maratha Gaikwar. He returned to Marwar placing Ratansingh Bhandari, his deputy, in charge. He recovered Baroda but his rivalry with other Mughal leaders Momin Khan and Sohrab Khan weaken him. Soon Momin Khan was appointed as the viceroy but he had to laid siege of Ahmedabad to be in power as Ratansingh had not complied with the order. Soon the emperor reappointed Abheysingh but Momin Khan continued siege. He took help of Damaji Gaikwar and finally captured Ahmedabad. He had to share revenues with Gaikwars but soon disagreements rose and they had fights. He tried to manage his control over Gujarat but the Marathas keep growing and expanding their power. After death of Momin Khan, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n managed the province foe a while. Abd√∫l √Åz√≠z Kh√°n, the commander of Junnar near Pune came to power due to forged order but later had to relinquish. Muftakhir Kh√°n, son of Momin Khan, appointed as the next viceroy. During his reign, the Marathas came to Ahmedabad and continued to attack towns in central Gujarat. Fakhr-ud-daulah succeeded him. He had some peace due to internal struggles between the different houses of the Marathas had slow down their advances in Gujarat. In 1748, the emperor Muhammad Shah died and was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Under Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1748‚Äì1754) The emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur appointed Vakhatsingh, brother of Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh of Marwar as a viceroy but he never took a charge. He was the last viceroy appointed by the Mughal emperor. Sensing opportunity in weakening Mughal power, the Marathas and the Mughal nobles started plotting to establish themselves in Gujarat. The Maratha houses, Gaikwar and Peshwa, engaged in a struggle and finally brokered a peace. Jawan Mard Khan, who was incharge of Ahmedabad, had to surrender to them after a long siege. Thus the Marathas established themselves firmly in Gujarat in 1752. In 1754, Ahmad Shah Bahadur was deposed and Alamgir II came to power on the Mughal throne. Under Alamgir II (1754‚Äì1756) The Marathas driven out the Mughal nobles under the emperor Alamgir II. One such noble, Momin Khan, had countered their advances and recovered Ahmedabad in 1756 lost to the Marathas few years ago. After a long siege, Ahmedabad fell again in hands of the Marathas. The Marathas levied tributes across Gujarat. In 1759, the English of the British East India Company captured Surat. Sadashiv Ramchandra was appointed as a viceroy by Peshwa in 1760 followed by Apa Ganesh in 1761. Following defeat of Marathas in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), the nobles briefly recovered towns from the Marathas but soon had to surrender. Thus the Marathas firmly established themselves in Gujarat. Administration The Gujarat subah covered an area of 302 kos (966.4 kilometres) between Burhanpur in the east and Jagat (Dwarka) in the west and 70 kos (224 kilometres) between Jalore in the north and Daman in the south. The twenty-five sarkars (administrative units) of Gujarat Sultanate were reorganised in 16 sarkars and the others areas were transferred back to its older provinces. Of this 16 sarkars; nine were under direct control of the Mughal Empire; Ahmadabad, Baroda, Bharuch, Champaner, Godhra, Nadaut, Patan, Sorath, and Surat. They were known as sarkarat-i kharaji where the Mughal fiscal system of revenue collection was applied. The other seven sarkars were under administration and fiscal jurisdictions of the local chiefs; Bansballa (Banswada), Dungarpur, Kutch, Nawanagar, Ramnagar, Sirohi and Sant. They were known as sarkarat-i peshkashi where annual tribute (peshkash) was collected by the Mughals. This local chiefs, zamindars, acknowledged the Mughal suzerainty and occasionally provided military support. Throughout the Mughal Empire, the single trimetallic currency was established but Gujarat continued to use a local silver coin known as Mahmudi alongside the Mughal currency.

The concept was first advanced by Arab thinker Ibn Khaldun (1332‚Äì1406), who compared an individual's decline after reaching the age of forty, with the sedentary decline that occurs in a dynasty.Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285. More recently, political scientist Joshua S Goldstein has used the concept in his 1988 book, Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age. A political midlife crisis occurs following a prolonged golden age of Expansionism, optimism, economic progress, conquest, or other success, and typically features attacks on, or threats toward, a rival power. The attacks are vigorously opposed, ending in stalemate or defeat. Political midlife crisis\\" is parallel to \\"midlife crisis\\" in a middle-aged person's identity and self- confidence, caused by the person's aging, mortality, and any perceived deficiencies in life attainments. Political midlife crisis applies the concepts of \\"social organism\\" and \\"body politic\\", which view an entire human society as a kind of single super-organism. History of the concept Ibn Khaldun, in the Muqaddimah (1377), set out a general theory of the rise and fall of regimes. A ruthless conqueror with a \\"desert attitude\\" establishes a new dynasty. Over some years, royal authority and asabiyyah (social cohesion) enable \\"expansion to the limit\\". Then, as in the life of an individual, a turning point is reached. According to Ibn Khaldun, when a man reaches forty he naturally stops growing, then begins to decline. The same is the case with a sedentary civilization's culture. The dynasty's new sedentary culture fosters a love of luxury and pomp. The people become over-taxed and acquire a \\"habit of subservience\\".Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 248. Their rulers subvert property rights and become weak, dishonest, and divided. Finally, after three generations‚Äîequivalent to a human lifespan‚Äîthe dynasty becomes \\"senile and coercive\\".Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, pp. 245, 255. There may follow a final \\"brightly burning show of power\\",Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 246. but collapse of the dynasty is inevitable. A new dynasty takes over, and the cycle continues. Ibn Khaldun says: \\"This senility is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, because it is something natural.\\"Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 245. In 1988, Joshua S Goldstein advanced the concept of the political midlife crisis in his book on \\"long cycle theory\\", Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age, which offers four examples of the process: *The British Empire and the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856): A century after Britain's successful launch of the Industrial Revolution, and following the subsequent British railway boom of 1815‚Äì1853, Britain, in the Crimean War, attacked the Russian Empire, which was perceived as a threat to British India and to eastern Mediterranean trade routes to India. The Crimean War highlighted the poor state of the British Army, which were then addressed, and Britain concentrated on colonial expansion and took no further part in European wars until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. *The German Empire (Second Reich) and World War I (1914‚Äì1918): Under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, Germany had been unified between 1864 and 1871, and then had seen 40 years' rapid industrial, military, and colonial expansion. In 1914 the Schlieffen Plan for conquering France in eight weeks was to have been followed by the subjugation of the Russian Empire, leaving Germany the master of Mitteleuropa (Central Europe). In the event, France, Britain, Russia, and the United States fought Germany to a standstill, to defeat, and to a humiliating peace settlement at Versailles (1919) and the establishment of Germany's unstable Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì33), in a prelude to World War II. *The Soviet Union and the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): The Soviet Union had industrialised rapidly under Joseph Stalin and, following World War II, had become a rival nuclear superpower to the United States. In 1962 Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, intent on securing strategic parity with the United States, covertly, with the support of Fidel Castro, shipped nuclear missiles to Castro's Cuba, 70 miles from the US state of Florida. US President John F. Kennedy blockaded (the term \\"quarantined\\" being used because a blockade is an act of war), the island of Cuba and negotiated the Soviet missiles' removal from Cuba (in exchange for the subsequent removal of US missiles from Turkey). *The United States and the Vietnam War (1955‚Äì1975): During World War II and the ensuing postwar period, the United States had greatly expanded its military capacities and industries. After France, supported financially by the US, had been defeated in Vietnam in 1954 and that country had been temporarily split into North and South Vietnam under the 1954 Geneva Accords; and when war had broken out between the North and South following South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem's refusal to permit all- Vietnam elections in 1956 as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the ideologically anti-communist United States supported South Vietnam with materiel in a Cold War proxy war and by degrees allowed itself to be drawn into South Vietnam's losing struggle against communist North Vietnam and the Viet Cong acting in South Vietnam. Ultimately, following the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States, the US's governing belief that South Vietnam's defeat would result in all of remaining Mainland Southeast Asia \\"going communist\\" (as proclaimed by the US's \\"domino theory\\"), proved erroneous. Following Al Qaeda's attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and the United States' subsequent inconclusive wars in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) and Iraq (2003‚Äì2011), initiated by US President George W. Bush, Professor Gary Weaver and his co-author Adam Mendelson, writing in 2008, cited a survey of 109 historians, 99% of whom rated Bush a \\"failure\\" as president, two-thirds rating him the \\"worst ever\\". Weaver and Mendelson wrote that the United States had been in its \\"childhood\\" before 1898; in its \\"adolescence\\", 1898‚Äì1945; in \\"young adulthood\\", 1945‚Äì1991; in \\"adulthood\\", 1991‚Äì2001. Weaver and Mendelson, from their 2008 perspective, anticipated that the traumas of the George W. Bush presidency would \\"season [the United States] with new strength, wisdom and maturity\\", enabling it to move forward from this political midlife crisis. The European debt crisis (2009‚Äìpresent) has been called the European Union's midlife crisis in articles by Gideon Rachman, Roland Benedikter, and Natalie Nougayr√®de. Other examples Leo Tolstoy, in War and Peace, asks about the 1812 French invasion of Russia: \\"What is the cause of this movement which took the French army all the way from Paris to Moscow, and then back to Paris? A system, a mysterious callous force ... the unconscious swarm-life of mankind.\\" The French decision to invade Russia in 1812 had been intended to secure a Franco-Russian alliance that would then conquer India, but it ended in a rout and in the exile of Bonaparte‚Äîprompting Stanley Michalak to write that \\"In 1812 Napoleon failed the supreme test of power politics‚Äîknowing when to stop.\\"Stanley Michalak, A Primer in Power Politics, SR Books, 2001, p. 6. The 1919 Amritsar massacre in India, a turning point for that country's British Raj, horrified world opinion and encouraged agitation for Indian independence. Similarly, the 1960 Sharpeville massacre in Apartheid South Africa brought on a state of emergency and drove the African National Congress underground and into armed struggle.[overcomingapartheid.msu.edu;]Michelle Miller, \\"Sharpeville Massacre Marked Turning Point in SA History\\", [cbsnews.com], 18 December 2013. Egypt's defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel was a political turning point for Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser and for the Arab cause. Nasser immediately offered his resignation and died three years later; the cause of Arab nationalism never recovered.Anonymous, \\"Six-day War Marked Political Turning Point in the Arab World\\", 2 June 2017. Mark Katz Mark Katz, Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves, St Martin's Press, 1997, p 83 describes the event as a \\"crisis of confidence from which [Egypt] never recovered\\". An Economist article was one of the first to recognize the nature of the 2007‚Äì08 credit crunch. Be√°ta Farkas sees the Euro crisis as another financial turning point. Nations at risk The Economist says it is a \\"question of when, not if, real trouble will hit China\\".Economist, \\"The Coming Debt Bust\\", The Economist, 7/5/2016. The country is approaching the limits of its potential power and growth, having in 2010 reached the Lewis turning point, an indicator of labour shortages.

He and the other assistant director, Benoit Godbout, worked underneath director Allan Macleod; Miller said that their work together ‚Äúmarked the beginning of a new approach to corrections and a reorientation of the parole system from clemency to rehabilitation.‚Äù In 1959, the government passed the Parole Act, which abolished the Remission Service, replacing it with the Parole Board of Canada ‚Äì a paroling authority independent from the Department of Corrections.

Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor is a nonfiction book by the British comedy writer Adam Kay, published in 2017 by Picador. It is a collection of diary entries written by Kay during his medical training from 2004 to 2010. Kay's book discusses political issues in the health care system of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and societal conflicts between the general population and neglected doctors. Kay accomplishes this by incorporating humour into his personal anecdotes that depict his life as he progresses through his medical training, and his eventual resignation from this career.  Background  This is Going to Hurt is mostly composed of diary entries Adam Kay wrote during his medical training under the National Health Service. It was recommended to Kay to write this diary as a \\"reflective practice\\" in which he could log any interesting clinical experiences he experienced throughout his training. Five years after his resignation, Kay was officially removed from the medical register which prompted him to dispose of all the medical files he had been storing, leading him to review his reflective journal. Around this time in 2015, junior doctors entered contract disputes with the NHS leading the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Jeremy Hunt, to accuse junior doctors of being greedy. This event motivated Kay to respond to this accusation by releasing This is Going to Hurt, which illustrates his own experiences as a junior doctor.  Outline  Adam Kay Kay began his medical training as a House Officer in 2004 with the United Kingdom's National Health Service after attending Dulwich College and Imperial College School of Medicine. In his comedic recollection of his time as a house officer, Kay describes four foreign objects he removed from patients' rectums, saving his first life, and long nights spent in the A&E.; Kay became a Senior House Officer by August 2005, a year after officially becoming a doctor. It is at this point in his career that he decided to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology, or \\"brats and twats\\" as Kay referred to it as. In August 2007, Kay was promoted to Registrar, the third highest ranking position after Consultant and Senior Registrar. His diary entries in his time as these positions describe multiple successful births, failed births, infertility problems, and sexually transmitted diseases/infections, along with a gruelling workload that included sleepless nights, unpaid overtime, minimal gratitude from co-workers, sleeping in the car park, and inability to have someone cover a shift leading to minimal holiday and sick time. Throughout these experiences, Kay recalls times in which he gets close to quitting due to the vast amount of stress the job inflicted on his life, harming his health and social relationships. What kept him going was the positive feeling that he would get after a shift in which he helps patients in multiple ways ranging from helping infertile couples become pregnant to delivering a multitude of babies a night. This feeling of being a \\"low-grade superhero\\" is what Kay claims helped him push through all the other inconveniences related to the job. On August 2010, Kay received his promotion to Senior Registrar. In the diary, Kay takes note of the increased responsibility that came with the promotion and how it added a new form of pressure since he now was supposed to be the person that got contacted in severe emergencies where the Senior House Officer and Registrar were unable to solve the problem. On 5 December, 2010, Kay unknowingly begins to perform a caesarean on a patient that had undiagnosed placenta praevia. Kay has to first deliver the placenta and then deliver the baby, which is dead and unable to be resuscitated. The detached placenta caused heavy haemorrhaging; Kay and the senior consultants called into theatre failed to stop the bleeding and, after 2 hours and 12 litres of blood loss, a hysterectomy was performed. The mother was transferred to the intensive care unit and Kay was told to expect the worst. After this event Kay became depressed. Whilst he had followed best practice, and the missed placenta praevia should have been found in previous scans, Kay obsessed that he might have prevented the death of the baby and endangerment of the mother's life by somehow diagnosing the placenta praevia prepartum. Several months after this event, Kay officially resigned from the job.  Themes  The most prevalent theme present in This is Going to Hurt is the mistreatment and neglect that doctors have to endure. Throughout his time working for the NHS, Adam Kay was deprived of multiple basic amenities that other occupations have. Kay was forced to stay hours after his shift would end with no pay, be unable to have a sick day or go on holiday because it was extremely difficult to find someone to cover his shift; while on shift, he would be unable to sleep even if he had free time; and, in general, junior doctors like Kay felt severely underpaid for their services. This sense of neglect was emphasised after Kay's career-ending event since he wasn't allowed to take any time off to emotionally recover. The next day he was forced to go back to work even though he wasn't in the right mindset to and had asked for a week off. No therapy was offered to Kay to possibly help him after the traumatic event, further debilitating his emotions and mind. The traumatic event emphasises another theme present which involves the humanising of doctors. In This is Going to Hurt Kay discusses how the general public expects doctors to be more than human. They expect doctors to be available at all times at their full efficiency, disregarding the fact that they are also humans. Kay claims that people forget doctors also have to spend time with their families and friends, they have to sleep, eat and take care of themselves, and more importantly they expect doctors to be error-free. Doctors' fallibility is unavoidable since they are human and are always prone to making mistakes. Not only did Kay make a mistake by missing the diagnosis of placenta praevia, but he had previously slightly cut the cheek of a newborn baby during a caesarean, mainly due to lack of sleep during his night shift. These main themes combine and form a response to Jeremy Hunt's comments concerning the true intentions of doctors. These themes in This is Going to Hurt justify that doctors like Kay are not greedy and don't pursue a career in medicine for the money. Through this book Kay demonstrates the many adversities junior doctors must face for the minimal pay they receive. By publishing the book, Kay sought to spread awareness of the difficulties doctors faced that justified them entering contract disputes with the NHS.  Critical reception  Upon its release in September 2017, This is Going to Hurt was widely lauded for the infusion of comedy it had while also spreading awareness of the lives of junior doctors. A large portion of the general population was surprised to learn the inside scoop of the life of a junior doctor, all the ups and downs they experience, and were pleased to find out that Adam Kay accomplished this task while still maintaining his typical humour throughout most of the book. This combination was applauded by The Scotsman by stating the book \\"will make your eyes water... and it may well make you choke on hot tea.\\" The social importance of the book is stressed later on in the review as being \\"vital and timely; it should be required reading for anyone who ever has any political or financial responsibility for [England's] health services.\\" The Daily Express called the book \\"hilarious, horrifying, and a heartbreaking insight into the life of a junior doctor.\\"  Recognition  Listed are all the recognitions This is Going to Hurt has received since its release: * 2017 Winner Blackwell's Debut of the Year * 2017 Winner Books are My Bag Non-fiction Book of the Year * 2017 Short-listed Blackwell's Book of the Year * 2017 Winner Books are My Bag Readers Awards Children's Award * 2018 Short-listed British Book Awards: Non-fiction Narrative Book of the Year * 2018 Short-listed Slightly Foxed Best First Biography Prize  Adaptations  Shortly after its release in September 2017, Naomi De Pear of Sister Pictures acquired the television rights to This is Going to Hurt. Sister Picture, an independent production company founded in 2015, acquired these rights in a 12-way auction between other interested producers. The television series based on This is Going to Hurt is being written by Adam Kay and developed by Katie Carpenter along with Naomi De Pear, who will also executive produce the series. On 6 July 2018, the BBC announced that the adaptation would be made by Sister Pictures and shown on BBC Two as an eight-part comedy-drama.

An eggplant run is a challenge playthrough of the 2012 roguelike-like platform video game Spelunky HD. Such a playthrough centers on carrying an eggplant item to the final boss of the game, King Yama, and tossing it into his face. This eggplant item was originally added to Spelunky as part of an easter egg pitched by the game's composer Eirik Suhrke, and Spelunkys lead designer Derek Yu decided to give it the additional function of turning King Yama into an inert eggplant monster. Though carrying out a full eggplant run in Spelunkys cooperative mode is fairly manageable, it is significantly harder to do a single-player eggplant run. Such a playthrough was first achieved by Twitch video game live streamer Bananasaurus Rex in November 2013, a month after Spelunky HDs PC release. This run was widely reported upon and described by Polygon as \\"an important, downright historic achievement.\\" Derek Yu went on to legitimize one of the exploits necessary to carry out such a solo eggplant run. Background Early on during development for Spelunky HD for Xbox 360, Eirik Suhrke was inspired by \\"Totaka's Song\\", a hidden music track Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka inserted in many of the video games he had worked on. Suhrke wanted to hide his own \\"Eirik's Song\\" in Spelunky and pitched the idea to Derek Yu. In his book about the game, Yu wrote that the idea of a secret music track \\"seemed like a no-brainer for a game ... laden with secrets and references,\\" but with other aspects of the game pressing, the idea was put on hold until a short time before the game's official release. Various ideas to access Suhrke's secret music track were considered and the team quickly settled on making the track play when a player places a \\"mystery box\\" item on a sacrificial altar dedicated to the goddess Kali. This was considered fairly obscure, as a player would usually open a mystery box immediately in order to reveal what is inside. Discussing what a player may get in return for sacrificing a mystery box in this way, Yu suggested an eggplant, as this fruit holds a \\"small but significant place\\" in video game history, having appeared in games such as Sam & Max Hit the Road, Ice Climber, Wrecking Crew, and Adventure Island. In his book, Yu wrote that he had always had an admiration for the type of absurdity video games can include without criticism, such as how Toru Osawa placed an Eggplant Wizard in the Greek mythological setting of Kid Icarus. Suhrke wanted the discovery of \\"Eirik's Song\\" to have no additional purpose, but Yu predicted that players would try to do something with the eggplant and decided to implement a purpose for it. The sprite sheet that carried the graphics for a few larger monsters in game still featured a blank area, and Yu quickly painted a five-frame animation of King Yama's face as a big, blinking eggplant. Yu added a few lines of code and superficially tested the behavior before moving on to other work he still had to do. The eggplant was first documented in October 2012, three months after Spelunky HD was released on the Xbox Live Arcade, and resulted in a large amount of speculation among the Spelunky community as to what purpose the eggplant may serve. It was not until the game's PC release in August 2013 that players were able to look into the game's source files and discover the sprites of King Yama's eggplant face. Using a cheat engine, Youtuber chaindead brought the eggplant to the final boss and demonstrated what happens when the item collides with King Yama's head. Several weeks later, a full \\"eggplant run\\" of Spelunky was completed in the game's cooperative mode. In this mode, mystery boxes are more abundant, and one player can hold on to the eggplant while the other advances through the levels. It was still unknown if an eggplant run would be possible in the game's single-player mode. Execution An eggplant run is very difficult to accomplish a single-player game. In order to get an eggplant in single-player mode, one needs to get a random seed in which a mystery box and one of Kali's sacrificial altars appear in the same level. Subsequently, the player needs to carry the fragile eggplant through each of the game's levels while simultaneously executing a sequence of actions that allows the player character to access the \\"hell\\" world of the game, where King Yama can be found. One of these actions is to kill the player character in the third world of the game so he resurrects inside of an otherwise indestructable Moai. However, a player loses whatever item they are holding in their hands while doing this, making it impossible to resurrect oneself with the eggplant. In late September, Spelunky streamers BaerTaffy and bisnap discovered a glitch that allows a player to destroy the blocks of which the Moai consists. To do this, the player needs a ball and chain, an item forced upon the player after two of Kali's altars are destroyed in a run. By exploiting this glitch, a player can take any item through the Moai, including the eggplant. In order to reach the Yama, a player needs to carry a sceptre from level 4‚Äì1 to level 4‚Äì2. As it is impossible to carry two items simultaneously, a player needs to bring a non-player character to these levels in order to carry the sceptre for them. However, such AI-controlled characters are difficult to manipulate and are prone to accidentally kill themselves, adding to the difficulty of solo eggplant runs. On November 10, 2013, Spelunky speedrunner and live streamer Bananasaurus Rex executed the first known successful solo eggplant run. This playthrough took him 76 minutes and 41 seconds of in-game time to complete and he did so with only one health point remaining. , Spelunky speedrun aggregator MossRanking has listed videos of successful solo eggplant runs by over 60 players, some of which impose additional restrictions (such as Maximum or No Gold). Legacy Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun reported on Bananasaurus Rex' solo eggplant run, appreciating the existence of \\"video game myths\\" and the positive effect they have on video game communities. Smith stated that \\"the eggplant video feels like a full stop on something,\\" and said that he \\"can't help but feel a little bit melancholic about that.\\" Eurogamer described the solo eggplant run as a \\"remarkable goal\\" and a \\"colossal feat\\", saying that watching Rex' \\"increasingly stressed mental state\\" resulted in a harrowing viewing experience. PC Gamer described this run as \\"an hour and 22 minutes of near misses, improbable saves, unbearable tension.\\" Douglas Wilson, writing for Polygon, described the first successful solo eggplant run as \\"an important, downright historic achievement,\\" calling it \\"2013's most fascinating video game moment.\\" According to Wilson, the first solo eggplant run was an example of how video game live streaming was changing video game culture, as Bananasaurus Rex' run was \\"indebted\\" to the live streaming community that gave players such as BaerTaffy and Rex \\"a reason to keep exploring and an audience to play for.\\" Wilson further emphasized the value of \\"secrets\\" in video games, quoting BaerTaffy saying that \\"the group of us rallying around this one big secret ending is one of the best things that can happen for a gaming community.\\" Lastly, Wilson suggested that the Spelunky community \\"[beat] Derek Yu and [programmer] Andy Hull at their own game,\\" subverting the designer's intentions by completing a run that was not intended to be possible. In an interview with GiantBomb in 2014, Derek Yu confirmed that the Moai being breakable by the ball and chain was indeed a glitch. Yu said that \\"it just so happened that the way we designed it, it was still possible to break it in this one way we didn't think of, ... but once people did break it and they're doing these really cool things with it ... then I think we're happy to just leave it in or tweak it a little bit to make it seem more official after the fact.\\" The team legitimized this exploit by changing the Moai sprite so it actually looks broken when it is destroyed.

He is one of the senior most person in India who was arrested and detained under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Political life Chakraborty worked in the Eastern Railway hawkers union led by Left politics. He was associated with the Communist Party of India before 1967 and later joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist). In the early 70s in West Bengal, he maintained his contacts with Naxal leaders but did not leave the CPI(M). Next three decades, he was attached with Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF) and various fractions of the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) as well as civil society movement in West Bengal. He became active in Singur and Nandigram movements at the time of Left Front (West Bengal) Government and played a crucial role in uniting urban support bases in favour of the tribal upsurge in Jangalmahal, the three Left wing extremism affected districts of Bankura, Purulia and Paschim Medinipur. In the time of Lalgarh movement, the CPI (Maoist) declared his name as outfit official spokesperson. Arrest On 23 June 2009 just immediately after the then Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's announcement to implement the ban on the CPI (Maoist) in the state of West Bengal, Kolkata Police arrested Chakraborty as he emerged from the office of a private TV channel in Kolkata after giving them an interview.

It was named in 2015 for Bruce Dougall, who undertook its construction during the 1960s. It is located in Orillia on Couchiching Point, a piece of land that separates Lake Couchiching from Lake Simcoe. The development of Couchiching Point was originally going to be a denser subdivision according to plans filed in 1890. The land remained undeveloped until Dougall began development in the 1960s, but the plans changed during development to be lower density and added the canal. The new development was known as Crescent Cove, and the canal was unnamed. The canal route generally follows the path of what was originally set aside for Cumberland Avenue. By cutting the canal, 55 lots had lake access instead of the original 25. The canal and small sections of land on either side of it were owned by the city, who had responsibility for keeping it operational. They failed to do so, and by the 2000s it was overgrown. The city agreed to give the land to the homeowners, many of whom had already build on the land. In exchange, the homeowners association took over maintanance of the cana. The canal is deep in the center, but reduces to at either end where it connects to the Trent-Severn Canal system. It is about long, running roughly north-south across the peninsula.

Early life Born in Colombo a son of Mr. A. B. Robinson, for many years commercial editor of the Melbourne Age. He was a grandson of William Barton, Australia's first stockbroker, by his daughter Harriet, and a nephew of Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia. He was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne and may have been destined for a law career, but found employment in the Melbourne stockbroking company of Donaldson & Co. This was the time of a great mining boom and Robinson discovered he had an aptitude for finances and at the comparatively early age of 22 was elected to the Melbourne Stock Exchange and went into partnership with William Clark (c. 1868 ‚Äì August 1948), also a member of the Melbourne Exchange, as Clark & Robinson. Clark & Robinson Robinson and Clark went into partnership in 1888 and developed a large and profitable business dealing in mining shares during the Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie mining booms. In 1895 Clark & Robinson moved their office to Adelaide, initially located at 27 Grenfell Street from April 1896 to October 1897, then Cowra Chambers, 23 Grenfell Street, then from March 1899 Brookman Building, 35 Grenfell Street. Robinson made substantial investments in the Hainault Goldmiming Company, which proved highly profitable. Robinson began an association with Kalgoorlie and its \\"Golden Mile\\" when the Great Boulder Proprietary opened up its 200 ft. level, and in the late '90s deputised Sydney J. Yeo to open the company's Kalgoorlie office. A large and lucrative business was developed with London, and Robinson moved there to handle this business in person. The rules of the London Stock Exchange not only demanded that he relinquish his membership of Australian Exchanges before he could join, but could not belong to an overseas partnership, so that with Clark was dissolved in May 1899 by mutual agreement. For a couple of years Robinson and Clark ran their respective offices independently, then decided to reunite in London. Clark and his accountant Guy Stanton left for England in May 1902. Clark, who had renounced membership of the Stock Exchanges of Melbourne and Adelaide, was elected a member of the London Stock Exchange as from 1 January 1905, and on the same day Clark joined Robinson as a partner of the firm of Lionel Robinson and Co., renamed Lionel Robinson, Clark & Co., with offices at 24 Throgmorton Street, London. Within two years it was the largest finance house dealing in Australian mining shares in London. Business was good and the company prospered even better than it had in Australia, and each became very wealthy. Robinson was ever on the lookout for business opportunities in Australia: in 1905 when the Broken Hill mines were struggling with a host of problems he organised a luxury private carriage on the \\"Barrier\\" train for an invited group of industrialists and investors, who invested thousands of pounds of British capital into the North and South mines, Zinc Corporation, and Amalgamated Zinc Companies. Robinson and Clark formed a company Broken Hill Syndicate Limited with W.L., E.L. and W. Baillieu and others. Although he made his fortune through mining stocks, Robinson was also interested in industrials: he was a major shareholder director of the London Motor Omnibus Company, and the London Underground Railways. As a director of the omnibus company he was concerned at the reputation motor 'buses had for unreliability, and insisted on a daily overhaul of each bus, whether giving problems or not, with immediate beneficial results. Robinson and Clark invested heavily in establishing woollen mills and associated factories in Victoria. From 1915 to 1921 Robinson was a committee member of the London Stock Exchange, and in 1916 became High Sheriff of Norfolk. When Robinson was alive the pair were known in the house as \\"the Siamese twins.\\" and were inseparable both in business and sport, but on the death of his partner Clark lost a great part of his enthusiasm for racing, and allowed his stable to become became a skeleton of its earlier self. Old Buckenham Robinson purchased the historic Hall at Old Buckenham in Norfolk in 1906, and seldom left for London unless on urgent business. A feature of the property was a fine cricket field, and a pitch second to none in England. Every distinguished visiting Australian sportsman and Australian XI was treated to the finest hospitality and given access to the best of facilities for the duration of their stay. One cricket commentator wrote: > There is hardly a more beautiful place in Norfolk than Mr. Lionel Robinson's > 'Buckenham Hall.' During the visit of the A.I.F. team to his home Mr. > Robinson had the favorite for the English Derby, and told us to have a > little on it, as it was very highly fancied.

In 1921 he fielded a team against Warwick Armstrong's Australian XI at Old Buckenham Hall, which attracted a large number of spectators. Windlesham Moor Robinson had the 50 acres laid out as a formal garden by noted landscape gardener Gomer Waterer. They sold the property to South African millionaire Philip Hill in 1942, and on his death passed to his wife, who became Mrs. Warwick Byant. Horseracing ;In Australia Clark and Robinson were partners as racehorse owners as well as in business. Clark engaged Richard Bradfield, who had recently lost a major client in Frederick W. Purches (c. 1852‚Äì1937), as their trainer in Australia, and that was the beginning of the long and fruitful connection of Clark and Robinson (dubbed \\"The Firm\\") with Bradfield's stable. Their Australian successes included: *SAJC Derby with Hainault (1898); with Rienzi (1902) *SAJC St Leger with The Victory (1898) *SAJC (Queen's) Birthday Cup with The Victory (1898) *VRC Standish Handicap with The Victory (1902) *Maribyrnong Plate with Niphetos (1901) *Melbourne Cup with The Victory (1902); Backwood (1924) Although Clark and Robinson were living in England they continued over a long period to keep a few horses with Bradfield. When racing was curtailed in England during The Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 they sent out Magpie, King Offa, Lanius, Lucknow, Elsdon, Shadowland, Coq d'Or and Escombe to Bradfield, who won races with most of them. *Futurity Stakes with Eudorus (1913); Flash of Steel (1915); Lucknow (1919) *Caulfield Cup with King Offa (1918); Lucknow (1919). This was a great one for Bradfield, who had trained the three placed horses: Lucknow, Night Watch, and Chrome. *The Metropolitan with St Spasa (1914) *Adelaide Cup with St Spasa (1916); Elsdon (1918) *Lanius was successful in some weight-for-age races *Magpie was successful in some weight-for-age races Their Australian racing manager was Isaac Earnshaw, and on his death in 1914 C. Leslie Macdonald took over. Macdonald retired three years later and the position was taken by S. Bloomfield. ;In England Unlike the principal Australian clubs, the English Jockey Club did not permit racing partnerships, and for that reason horses belonging to the Clark-Robinson partnership were raced in England in the name of one or other of the partners. At their Old Buckenham stud at Attleborough, Norfolk, they bred and trained dozens of top-flight thoroughbred racehorses. Gingal, Linacre, Merrylips, Demure and Sham Fight won 11 races in 1907. Other winners were All Black, Basil, The Whirlpool, and Linacre in 1908; Slipton, Basil, and Budorus in 1909; Prince Galahad in 1920. Some or all were trained by J. E. \\"Jack\\" Brewer, and their jockeys included Stanley Wootton. Death Robinson died of cancer at Old Buckenham Hall on 27 July 1922, having taken little part in financial affairs after the war. He left an estate valued at around ¬£240,000.Peter Richardson, 'Robinson, Lionel George (1866‚Äì1922)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/robinson-lionel-george-8549/text14441, published first in hardcopy 1988.

Founded in 1972, it operates as an executive club and corporate university for a diverse set of 20 global companies including L‚ÄôOr√©al, Aviva, Renault, Bekaert, Valeo, AXA, GDF Suez, and TATA Steel. CEDEP offers two types of programs: Open Enrollment, available to managers from all member companies, and Company Specific programs. Most programs are delivered on CEDEP's purpose-built, residential campus, but in recent years CEDEP has been delivering programs off-campus, notably in China, Brazil, and Canada.  History  CEDEP was created over 40 years ago by a group of European companies as an executive education club, and was among the first corporate- founded membership institutions in Europe dedicated to executive education.The nucleus of Europe's management education, The Times (of London) May 11, 1972 In its early days, CEDEP was essentially a sister organization to INSEAD, which at the time focused on MBA education.Former des cadres sur m√©sure by Jacques Malherbe, l'Aurore. November 19, 1971 Faculty teaching at CEDEP in its early years were drawn almost exclusively from INSEAD's more experienced faculty, notably Henri-Claude de Bettignies, Robin M. Hogarth, Claude Rameau, and Lee Remmers.INSEAD: d'une intuition a une institution by Jean-Louis Barsoux, INSEAD 2000, , p. 122 The initial impetus was led by L'Or√©al's head of Human Resources, Guy Landon, and Fran√ßois Dalle, its CEO. They were joined by and Jean-Leon Donnadieu (BSN, which later merged with Gervais-Danone), (Pricel and Rhone Progil, which would become part of the Rhone-Poulenc group), (Bekaert), and Ren√© Dunant (Sandoz).Cedep: une \\"vraie\\" formation permanente by Martine Borrelly, Les Informations No. 1384M Renaud Gillet: vice pr√©sident du Rhone Poulenc by A.V., Le Figaro, August 24, 1972 The three main objectives for the founders were to: (1) expose managers to a mix of nationalities and industry contexts; (2) provide participants with a contrast between the theories and practice of management; and (3) create a force for change within their companies by establishing a critical mass of managers who had shared a key educational experience.Assessing management education: A summary of the CEDEP project by R. M. Hogarth, Journal of European Industrial Training, 2, (Whole No. 2), pp. 3-4 The CEDEP campus was opened in 1971 by the then French Finance Minister, Valery Giscard d'Estaing,Inauguration √† Fontainebleau du centre europ√©en d'education permanente by G.S., Le Figaro November 19, 1971 (Section \\"Universit√©\\") who was to become France's President just three years later. Designed by a contemporary French architect, Bernard de la Tour d'Auvergne, who also helped design the original buildings on the INSEAD campus, the buildings combine brick and glass to reflect the colors of the surrounding Fontainebleau Forest.Architecture d'Aujourd'hui No. 160, Fevrier- Mars 1972 pp. 54-7 The buildings were extended in 2000 with additional wings that conserve the architectural style of the original buildings. The campus grounds also feature large sculptures by a number of celebrated European sculptors, including Francois-Xavier and Claude Lalanne, who designed the original campus,CEDEP: 40 Years of Adding Value (an official history of CEDEP),CEDEP 2012, , p. 91 and Francesco Marino di Teana. The campus interior houses a notable collection of contemporary wall carpets by the likes of Sonia Delaunay (co-founder of the Orphism movement), and Natalia Dumitresco. CEDEP's evolution was greatly influenced by two long-serving Directors. In 1971 Salvatore Teresi, an INSEAD Marketing professor who was also one of CEDEP's founders, became its first Director General. Over the following 20 years he oversaw an expansion in membership to 23 companies that resulted in more than 6,000 participants attending CEDEP's programs.CEDEP Twenty Years After And For A New Departure, Text of addresses given by Guy LANDON, Claude RAMEAU, and Salvatore TERESI to mark the retirement of Salvatore TERESI as Director of CEDEP, printed by HELIO SERVICE 1991, p. 3 Claude Michaud, Teresi's Deputy Director (and also an INSEAD professor), took over in 1991 and led CEDEP for the next 16 years. Under his leadership CEDEP extended its membership to 20 members, including companies from outside Europe, most notably Tata Steel. It was also under Michaud's tenure that CEDEP started offering off-campus programs, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. Under the tenure of Michaud's successor, Han van Dissel, CEDEP extended its overseas activities, offering off-campus programs in China, Brazil, Canada and South Korea. In 1979, an INSEAD decision-science professor, Robin M Hogarth, who also taught at CEDEP, undertook an in-depth study of CEDEP's General Management Program in order to assess whether executive education improved managerial decision-making. This project resulted in a book, Evaluating Management Education, published by John Wiley & Sons in 1979 ( ).

On September 22, 2017, following nomination by President Trump and unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Coleman was sworn-in as United States Attorney. Early life and career Coleman grew up in rural western Kentucky, having been raised in Graves, Graves and Logan Counties, and graduated from Logan County High School. He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kentucky. Coleman previously served as a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as legal counsel to United States Senator Mitch McConnell, and as the Briefing Coordinator to two U.S. Attorney's General at the U.S. Department of Justice. He practiced law in Louisville as a partner at Frost Brown Todd from 2015 to 2017 and served as an Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's 12th Judicial Circuit. Coleman currently serves as Vice Chair of the Law Enforcement Coordination & Relations Subcommittee of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee (AGAC) and a member of the AGAC's Heroin and Opiate Working Group. Coleman also serves on the Executive Board of the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). U.S. Attorney The Western District of Kentucky encompasses 53 counties with a population of more than 2.2 million, includes two military installations and federal courthouses in Louisville, Bowling Green, Paducah, and Owensboro. The Office is responsible for prosecuting violations of federal law, to include crimes related to firearms, narcotics, public corruption, child exploitation, wire and bank fraud, and terrorism. The office also defends the United States in civil cases. In February 2019, Coleman penned a guest column for The Courier-Journal reflecting on the opioid crisis and his firsthand experience viewing an autopsy of a suspected overdose victim. Coleman wrote \\"I recognize that we will not be able to arrest our way out of the drug crisis. But it is equally true that prevention and treatment alone cannot solve the crisis.\\" Coleman published a second guest column in The Courier-Journal in July 2019. As the homicide rate in Louisville began to increase, he declared Louisville had a violent crime problem. Coleman promised \\"a more muscular and visible response by federal law enforcement\\" but said \\"arresting our way out of this problem is not, alone, a long-term solution. He cited \\"historic racism that imposed shameful inequities and structural barriers to inherited wealth and opportunity\\" as issues to be addressed. Pegasus Institute co-founder Jordan Harris called Coleman \\"the best prosecutor in America,\\" writing that as U.S. Attorney Coleman has gained \\"unparalleled reverence among law enforcement officials and unparalleled fear among law breakers.\\" In late 2019, Coleman completed meetings with law enforcement and business leaders in all 53 counties of the Western District of Kentucky. The visits, a first for a sitting U.S. Attorney, culminated with guest columns in multiple Kentucky news outlets including the Courier-Journal and in Kentucky Today, declaring \\"all Kentucky families deserve protecting.\\" \\" Coleman was appointed to President Donald Trump's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice Law Enforcement Recruitment and Training Working Group in February of 2020. According to a press release from the Department of Justice, the Working Group will hear from experts and practitioners with firsthand experience within law enforcement about best practices, challenges, and innovative strategies to address and enhance law enforcement operations and processes, including the recruitment and training of law enforcement. WLKY-TV in Louisville covered Coleman's appointment to the commission and his promise that Kentucky voices will be heard. As protests, riots, and looting struck Louisville in early June of 2020, Coleman penned an op-ed promising a joint response from federal law enforcement in regards to looting. He promised to protect the rights of protestors and tackle the criminals who used the protests as an opportunity to destroy the community, saying \\"two groups have emerged: one group, the majority of protesters, are forcefully and peacefully demanding that their voices be heard. A second smaller group consists of criminals using the cover of the protests to burglarize drug stores for their controlled substances and gun shops, loot almost half a dozen ATMs, carjack vehicles and shoot at police. This is violence and mayhem, not constitutionally protected protest.\\" By mid-June multiple people were charged federally including multiple defendants who allegedly robbed a pharmacy, one for carjacking, and at least two others who were convicted felons with firearms.\\" References External links * Biography at Department of Justice Living people University of Kentucky alumni University of Kentucky College of Law alumni 21st-century American lawyers Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Kentucky lawyers United States Attorneys for the Western District of Kentucky Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Russell Coleman"},{"id":"55286427","text":"Definite Maybe may also refer to: * \\"Definite Maybe\\", track on 1983 album State of Confusion by The Kinks * \\"Definite Maybe\\", track on 2009 Welcome to My World (Jonathan Fagerlund album) * \\"A Definite Maybe\\", 2013 single by Indica (Finnish band) * \\"A Definite Maybe\\", 2005 single by Dean Tuftin *The Definite Maybe, renamed No Money Down, a 2005 feature film DVD from Mark Saint Juste * The Definite Maybe, a 1997 film with Roy Scheider See also *Definitely Maybe (disambiguation) ","title":"Definite Maybe"},{"id":"55286433","text":"Porfirio Fisac de Diego (born January 24, 1965) is a Spanish basketball coach who currently works for Gran Canaria of the Liga ACB.

Biography  Cozens was born in Edmonton, Middlesex in 1909, the son of James Henry Theodore Charles Cozens and Mary Margarite Cozens (n√©e Jones). He was a bank clerk by profession and his family came from the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire. He married Elizabeth Kindlberger in London in 1939. In 1935, Cozens' mother Mary died, leaving ¬£145 to Lewis and his brother David. In 1939, his father a civil servant also died, leaving Lewis ¬£150 in his will. The unusual declaration in the will was reported in the Birmingham Daily Post, it said the bequest was \\"in view of the fact that I paid no premium for his career and he was no charge to me from the age of eighteen\\". During his holidays in Wales before and after World War Two, he explored the many minor railways of mid Wales. As early as 1944, Cozens was actively researching the history of the Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway. In that year he began a correspondence with Selwyn Pearce Higgins about the discovery of historical records of the Tramway. This led to the publication of Cozens' 1955 book on the Plynlimon and Hafan. In 1949, he published the first of his histories on Welsh railways, about the Talyllyn Railway. These early books were self- published and were slim volumes, as printing paper was still rationed in the immediate post-war years. He soon followed with books on the Corris Railway, the Mawddwy Railway and other local lines. His books were the first serious attempt to publish histories of these railways and they introduced many early railway enthusiasts to them. Cozens was a friend of other notable early railway historians, including James Boyd, and R. W. Kidner. Cozens and Boyd have been described as the \\"eminent authors on the minor railways of North- and Mid-Wales\\". Several of Cozen's early books were later expanded and republished. While many of his books have been superseded by more detailed histories, his work was influential on later authors and provided important early coverage of the subject.

Along with Jon Tiven, he led the Memphis power pop group Prix before embarking on a solo career. He also provided backing vocals on Big Star's third album, Third/Sister Lovers, and collaborated with Big Star members Alex Chilton and Chris Bell as well as Memphis power pop group The Scruffs. Hoehn and Tiven formed Prix in 1975, not long after Hoehn had given Tiven a tape of his material. Enlisting Chris Bell as a co-producer, the group recorded numerous songs in Ardent Studios over a six-month period. While Prix garnered some major label interest, and performed at a Columbia/CBS Records showcase in New York in 1976, the group ultimately only released two contemporaneous singles, and broke up in early 1977. A compilation of eleven songs recorded by Prix, entitled Historix, would be released almost 40 years later. Following the break up of Prix, Hoehn pursued a solo career, releasing the regional hit single Blow Yourself Up in 1977 on Power Play Records, a local Memphis label. That same year, Power Play Records released Hoehn's first solo album Spacebreak, which contained two of the songs Hoehn had recorded with Prix as well as the Blow Yourself Up single. In 1978, London Records signed Hoehn and released Spacebreak and an additional song as the album Losing You to Sleep. The album was critically well received, with both Billboard and Cashbox giving it highly positive reviews. In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau described the album as a \\"romantically inclined sample\\" of \\"the concentrated energy of Memphis power pop.\\" Despite the favorable reviews, and despite promotional support, such as a full page ad in Rolling Stone, the album did not sell well. In 1981, Hoehn released the album I Do Love The Light, which he followed up in 1983 with the EP I'm So Afraid of Girls. Following more than a decade-long hiatus, Hoehn returned to the music business in the 1990s, releasing the albums Of Moons and Fools in 1996 and The Turning Dance in 1997. He then teamed up with fellow Memphis power pop artist Van Duren, releasing three albums in the period from 1999 to 2002: Hailstone Holiday,Cows on the Fence, and Blue Orange.

Description Dissotis rotundifolia can grow in a variety of ways, from straight up and erect to lying flat and prostrate to decumbent, meaning the branches lie flat on the ground but turn up at the ends. When the stems trail, they root where the leaf connects to the stem, called the \\"node\\". The stems are woody on lower parts of the plant and become hirsute, meaning hairy, towards the top of the plant. The branches tend to spread wide, and range from pink to a dark reddish in color. The leaves are oval shaped and three-ribbed, being long and wide.John Wilkes (1820) Encyclopaedia Londinensis, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature Volume 17 They are covered with short, appressed hairs on both sides. The stalks of the leaves are as long as , pilose, and pink. The flowers of Dissotis rotundifolia are solitary, and the stalks of the flowers, like the leaves, are covered with tiny appressed hairs. The petals of the flower are in length and range from pink to a pale purple in color.Alain H. Liogier (1982) Descriptive Flora of Puerto Rico and Adjacent Islands Habitat and ecology Dissotis rotundifolia is native to Africa, occurring naturally in central and western Africa from Sierra Leone to Zaire.

It was released on 14 August 2017 through Dirty Hit as the album's third single. Release and live performances \\"Beautifully Unconventional\\" premiered on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show on 14 August 2017, and subsequently released for digital download and streaming services. Rowsell said she wrote the song about one of her friends: \\"My feelings towards her reminded me of the film Heathers, where everyone is a Heather and you find your other non-Heather‚Ä¶ a 'you can be my partner in crime', sorta thing.\\" The band performed the song live for the first time on 26 July at the Echo in Los Angeles. It has since been part of their setlist on tour. The song was also part of the band's Live Lounge session on 19 September. On 17 October, they performed the song on Later... with Jools Holland. Composition \\"Beautifully Unconventional\\" is based around a \\"chunky guitar line.\\" Will Richards of DIY compared the song to American singer Beck, and noted the influence on the song from the song's producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen, who's best known for his work with the singer. Orignte classified the song as indie rock, while the Guardians Dave Simpson characterized it as pop-funk, later stating that it \\"might even have a faint melodic nod to Aretha Franklin's Respect.\\" NMEs Will Butler noted that the song \\"leans closer to the softer, warmer and catchy stylings of 'Don't Delete the Kisses' than it does the furious, punk sputter of 'Yuk Foo'.\\" Critical reception Drowned in Sounds Dom Gourlay said the song \\"finds the band traversing the world of pop at its most conventional. Once again highlighting Rowsell's gift for observational storytelling, it's a delightful spanner in the works that draws several hundred gasps of adulation from those present.\\" Robin Murry of Clash said the song is \\"a rallying cry, the choppy guitar lines proving to be overpowering without every venturing into the obvious,\\" continuing: \\"The stuttering vocal continually reaches outwards, and we can already see this becoming a live anthem.\\" Dork wrote, \\"it's a retro-cinematic delight. An earworm fed on other, lesser siblings, it has a confident, Diet Coke commercial strut. It knows it looks good, and it's not afraid to flaunt it.\\" Music video A 50s-inspired music video for the song was uploaded the band's Vevo channel on YouTube on 11 September 2017. Rowsell told the Fader regarding the video that the song is \\"a celebration of all your non-conforming friends; a celebration of individuality and the adventures that come with embracing that. For me personally, I imagined me and my mate Hannah as Christian Slater and Winona Rider in Heathers (albeit looking nothing like them).

She is best known for her documentation of lives in the conflict zones of the Caucasus. Biography Anush Babajanyan studied at the Caucasus Media institute. In 2005, Babajanyan graduated from a programme of photography courses was offered by World Press Photo organised by Ruben Mangasaryan. She graduated with a degree in mass communications from the American University in Bulgaria in 2006. Career After her graduation, Babajanyan worked as a contractor for the BBC Monitoring Service in Armenia, following which she became a freelance photojournalist. From 2008, Babajanyan began to photograph women on the streets of Yerevan who distinguished themselves with their bright and unrestrained clothing. This developed as a project she called Inlandish, a neologism she used in opposition to the word outlandish, in which she explored how the women's inner lives manifested in their exterior world. In 2009, Babajanyan began a project documenting the survivors of the Gyumri earthquake. Even twenty years after, nearly 4000 families were living in metal self-built shacks called domiks. These had no electricity or water supplies and were so ramshackle that another temblor would shatter them. Her pictures were exhibited in December 2009, in Yerevan. Babajanyan co-founded the women's photography collective 4Plus in 2013. A joint exhibition, mOther Armenia, with ten photographers was one of the first projects of 4Plus. Inspired by and in opposition to the Mother Armenia statue in Yerevan's Victory Park that symbolised reverence for women, each of the ten collections exposed different issues faced by women in the country. Babajanyan also began a long-term project documenting the migration of Armenian women to Turkey for work. In 2016, Babajanyan began a project to document the experiences of Syrian Armenians who fled the Syrian Civil War to Yerevan. While the Armenian government acted speedily to give citizenship to the refugees, their economic situation remained precarious, with both jobs and official housing in short supply. Babajanyan's photographs showed the domestic lives of the refugees. In particular, she showed the artefacts of significance that they brought with them to remember their previous lives. She, along with John Stanmeyer and Serra Akcan, started Bridging Stories, a photography training programme for Turks and Armenians to take and share pictures of their daily life on Instagram, in order to promote understanding between their peoples. In 2017, Babajanyan travelled in Ivory Coast, where she documented the people's belief in the mystical powers of twins. Identically dressed siblings would mill about near mosques, and passers-by would give them money in return for a blessing. A photo series was exhibited in Abidjan. She also appeared in Levison Wood's television programme From Russia to Iran, where she guided him into Nagorno-Karabakh.

Between 1915 and 1917, he served in the army, rising to sergeant major. In 1917, Matthews married Esme Elizabeth Hawke; they had a daughter and were divorced in the 1930s. After World War I, Matthews joined Wellington's daily newspaper, The Dominion, as a junior reporter. Interested in horticulture, he wrote a weekly newspaper column under the pseudonym ‚ÄòThe Hoe‚Äô. He also lectured on horticulture at Victoria University College, was a founding member of the Wellington Beautifying Society (which planted trees around the city), and gave frequent talks on gardening. Matthews rose to become the paper's first news editor in 1934, remaining in that position for eight years.

She acquired most of her knowledge of the classics, philosophy, modern languages, botany, astronomy, and chemistry through independent study. She was reputedly \\"one of the most learned women of the nineteenth century.\\"  Early life and education  Sarah Alden Bradford was born in Boston on July 31, 1793, the oldest of nine children of Gamaliel Bradford III and Elizabeth Hickling Bradford. Her mother had tuberculosis and her father was a sea captain who was often away on voyages, leaving Sarah to care for her younger siblings. The family lived in Boston but often spent time in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where her paternal grandfather lived. There she met Abba B. Allyn, who became a lifelong friend. Allyn's father, Dr. John Allyn, tutored both girls in Latin and Greek. Bradford also attended classes taught by Jacob Abbot Cummings in Boston, and read the books her father brought home from his travels. While in her teens she taught herself to read French and Italian, and studied chemistry, physics, and botany on her own initiative. According to one biographer, it took Bradford two weeks to work up the courage to ask her father for permission to study Latin. When she finally did, her father laughed and said, \\"A girl study Latin! Yes, study Latin if you want to. You may study anything you please.\\" In 1813 the family moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts, where Bradford's father became the warden of the Charlestown State Prison. There she tutored her younger siblings in a makeshift schoolroom above the kitchen. She acquired a college education by proxy when her brothers attended Harvard College and she read their books. She also read German biblical criticism and had many discussions of theology with her aunt and mentor, Mary Moody Emerson. One of her younger brothers, Gamaliel Bradford (1795-1839), went on to become a physician and a noted abolitionist.  The Ripley School  Her mother died in 1817, and soon afterwards she received a proposal of marriage from Samuel Ripley (1783-1847), a Harvard-educated Unitarian minister. Although she did not relish the thought of living in the country as a parson's wife, she accepted on the advice of her father. The couple were married on October 13, 1818, and moved into the parsonage in Waltham, Massachusetts, where Samuel Ripley was minister of the First Church. There they ran a small boarding school that accommodated about 14 boys, as well as four of Sarah's younger siblings. Sarah (now Sarah Ripley) was the \\"sole matron\\" of the school. Sarah and Samuel Ripley had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. In addition to raising the children, Sarah Ripley taught at the school with the occasional help of tutors, including the young Ralph Waldo Emerson. The school gained an excellent reputation largely due to Sarah Ripley's scholarship and skill as a teacher. Harvard President Edward Everett said that she could have filled in for any professor at Harvard. Harvard would sometimes send students to her who had been \\"rusticated\\" (suspended); according to one of her former students, George Frisbie Hoar, they would come away \\"better instructed than they would have been if they had stayed in Cambridge.\\" In her thirties, she struggled to reconcile her faith with her knowledge of science. She often discussed spiritual matters with Frederic Henry Hedge, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, George Ripley, Convers Francis, and Theodore Parker, as well as her friend and relative Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Later years  The Old Manse, Concord In the spring of 1846, the Ripleys retired to Concord, Massachusetts, where Samuel Ripley had inherited a house from his father, Ezra Ripley. Its prior occupant, Nathaniel Hawthorne, published Mosses from an Old Manse that same year, and the house became known as \\"The Old Manse.\\" Sarah Ripley continued tutoring students occasionally, including her grandchildren, and her husband continued preaching. Family friends in Concord included Franklin B. Sanborn, Ellery Channing, and Asa Gray. Samuel Ripley died of a heart attack in 1847, leaving Sarah Ripley to care for seven children, a grandchild, and a son-in-law. During the Civil War, one of her sons joined the Union army and was killed near Vicksburg in 1863. She died on July 26, 1867, at the home of her daughter, Mary Ripley Simmons. She was buried with her husband at the Emerson family plot in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord.  Tributes  Ripley's contemporaries typically followed their praise for her intellect with some praise for her housekeeping and parenting skills. In 1876, her biography was included in a book published by the directors of the Centennial Exposition, along with those of five others who were considered \\"the best examples of American womanhood.\\" In it, she is introduced as \\"one who combined rare and living knowledge of literature and science with the household skill and habits of personal labor needful to New England women of limited means.\\" Ralph Waldo Emerson called her \\"one of the best Greek scholars in the country,\\" then hastened to add that \\"her mind was purely receptive. She had no ambition to propound a theory, or to write her own name on any book, or plant, or opinion. Her delight in books was not tainted by any wish to shine...\\" Emerson took care to reassure readers that her housework never suffered as a result of her studies: > But this wide and successful study was, during all the hours of middle life, > only the work of hours stolen from sleep, or was combined with some > household task which occupied the hands and left the eyes free. She was > faithful to all the duties of wife and mother in a well-ordered and > eminently hospitable household. George Frisbie Hoar called her \\"one of the most wonderful scholars of her time, or indeed of any time,\\" and in the same paragraph described her as \\"simple as a child, an admirable wife and mother, performing perfectly all the commonest duties of the household.\\" Her friend Frederic Henry Hedge, observing in his eulogy that Ripley had never published a single piece of writing, praised her modesty and called her \\"a perfect woman.\\" References Citations Bibliography   Further reading * Samuel Ripley Papers, Houghton Library, Harvard University 1793 births 1867 deaths American women educators People from Boston Women scholars and academics ","title":"Sarah Bradford Ripley"},{"id":"55286984","text":"ortho-Methylphenylpiperazine (oMPP, oMePP), or 1-(2-methylphenyl)piperazine (2-MPP, 2-MePP), is a psychoactive and designer drug of the phenylpiperazine group.

Early life  Tim was born on January 5, 1985 in Kalispell, Montana and raised in Butte, Montana. Tim was given his first guitar at the age of six. Since his family's trailer had no electricity, Tim taught himself to play by candlelight. He later performed in school talent shows. After graduating from Butte High School in 2003, he moved to Los Angeles to study music.  Musical career  It was while living in Los Angeles that Tim met guitarist and producer Johnny Hiland. With Hiland's encouragement, he moved to Nashville and began playing country and southern rock. His debut album, Iron Horse, was produced by Hiland (who also played guitar and sang backup) and released on the CD Baby label on August 21, 2007. Earlier that same year, late-night talk show host David Letterman met Montana prior to Montana's Independence Day concert in Choteau, Montana. Months later, Letterman personally invited Montana to appear on The Late Show with David Letterman. Montana performed his song \\"Butte, America\\" on the show's October 17, 2008 broadcast. In 2013, Montana recruited guitarist Kyle Rife, drummer Brian Wolff, and bassist Bryce Paul to perform as Tim Montana and the Shrednecks. During a studio session on September 11, 2013, Montana was introduced to ZZ Top founder Billy Gibbons. Their meeting resulted in an impromptu songwriting collaboration, during which the two co-wrote and recorded the single \\"This Beard Came Here to Party.\\" The Boston Red Sox (known at the time for beards they'd grown during the playoffs) adopted the song as their anthem during the lead-up to the 2013 World Series. The Shrednecks and Gibbons recorded a custom version for the post-season (with lyrics referencing Red Sox highlights and Boston landmarks). Montana and the band later returned to sing The Star-Spangled Banner at Fenway Park at a May 28, 2013 ceremony honoring the winning 2004 World Series Red Sox team. Montana and Gibbons would go on to share credits on three other songs: \\"Fifty Fifty,\\" ‚ÄúWeed and Whiskey,\\" and \\"Rust and Red.\\" The last of these received its broadcast debut during the Fox News show The Five during an interview with Navy SEAL Team 6 member Robert J. O'Neill, subject of the Fox News documentary The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden. O‚ÄôNeill, a fellow native of Butte, had previously become acquainted with Montana through O‚ÄôNeill's brother Tom, a radio DJ and early supporter of Montana's music. Robert J. O'Neill later featured prominently in the 2017 music video for Montana's single \\"Hillbilly Rich\\". Following the release of \\"This Beard Came Here to Party,\\" Gibbons invited Tim Montana to open for ZZ Top on tour. Tim Montana and the Shrednecks have continued to appear with ZZ Top and opened for Kid Rock on various tour dates during the summer of 2016. On February 24, 2016, Tim Montana released the album Tim Montana and the Shrednecks, featuring Gibbons on four tracks. Tim Montana released the single \\"Hillbilly Rich\\" on September 8, 2017. He released a video for the song on Sep 19 which features friend Robert J. O'Neill and \\"Streetbike\\" Tommy Passemante from MTV's Nitro Circus. In their review of the video Rolling Stone wrote that its \\"aspirational swagger is perfectly on message for Montana's eclectic musical influences\\". Actor Charlie Sheen took an interest in the video stating on Twitter \\"this is a stone-cold masterpiece! my man is flat out KILLIN THE GAME\\" to his millions of followers. Montana wrote two songs which Kid Rock recorded for release as singles and are featured on the 2017 tour \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\". The song \\"Tennessee Mountain Top\\" is receiving airplay on Country radio stations.  Personal  Montana is a vocal supporter of U.S. military veterans. After watching the film American Sniper (which tells the story of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle), Montana became involved in the welfare of veterans suffering from Posttraumatic stress disorder. He approached Gibson guitars to create a custom Chris Kyle guitar, decorated with Kyle's skull-and-crosshairs logo.

The station is owned by Rincon Broadcasting and broadcasts a rhythmic oldies music format branded \\"Old School 94.1 and 1490 AM\\". KOSJ is rebroadcast on FM translator K231CR in Santa Barbara on 94.1 MHz. History Early years The station launched on the 720 kHz frequency as KFCR in April 1926; it moved to 1420 kHz the following year. KFCR was purchased in 1929 by George Barnes, owner of KGB in San Diego. Barnes changed the call letters to KDB in tribute to his wife, _D_ orothy _B_ arnes, and moved the station to 1500 kHz. In October of that year, KDB's license was canceled for failure to comply with regulations from the Federal Radio Commission (forerunner to the Federal Communications Commission or FCC). At issue were broadcasts featuring The Crusaders, an organization that promoted the repeal of Prohibition. The station's management fought vigorously to get the license back, and KDB returned to the air by the end of the year. Over the next couple of decades, KDB was bought and sold several times. In 1931, it became part of the Don Lee Network by virtue of being sold to Lee under the corporate name Santa Barbara Broadcasters. KDB relocated to the 1490 kHz frequency in 1941. In 1969, Len Menard, doing business as KDB Broadcasting Company, attempted to sell KDB and its FM counterpart to music publisher Hugh Heller in two separate transactions. The AM outlet was slated to sell for $500,000 on April 30, while KDB-FM was to yield $100,000 in a deal reached August 5. However, the FCC did not approve the transfer of either license to Heller. On November 27, 1970, Menard sold KDB-AM-FM to Pacific Broadcasting Company, owned by Richard E. Marsh, for $400,000; this deal was approved by the FCC. On September 1, 1990, KDB changed its call letters to KSPE. Two months later, in a reorganization effort, Pacific Broadcasting sold KSPE to Spectacular Broadcasting for $302,000. Around the same time, the station began airing a regional Mexican music format. The station's call sign changed once again on January 20, 1997 to KBKO to reflect its new branding, \\"Radio Bronco\\"; the format remained the same. In October 1998, Spectacular sold KBKO and its sister station, then known as KSPE-FM, to Jacor Communications for $4.6 million; Jacor merged with Clear Channel Communications the following year. Rincon era (2007‚Äìpresent) On January 11, 2007, Clear Channel Communications sold all of its radio stations in Santa Barbara, including KBKO, to Rincon Broadcasting for $17.3 million. Rincon switched KBKO‚Äôs format from regional Mexican to progressive talk. On October 28, 2008, KBKO changed its call sign to KIST. On July 19, 2010, KIST adopted the call letters KSPE, a change that preceded a flip on September 15 to a Spanish-language adult hits format with the branding \\"La Preciosa\\". In July 2017, KSPE adjusted its format to Spanish adult contemporary and adopted the branding \\"La Musical\\". On September 14, 2017, La Musical moved to KFYZ (94.5 FM); KSPE stunted with a looped announcement in Spanish notifying listeners to tune in at the new frequency.

The song has been the club's entrance music since 2009, having replaced the previous anthem \\"Heja Bl√•vitt\\". The song is a remake of \\"A Young Summer's Youth\\", off Alme's debut album, but with new lyrics. The melody had also previously been used in the song \\"Utan personlig insats\\" by H√§stpojken, a band Alme was a member of between 2007 and 2008. Background Before the start of the 2009 IFK G√∂teborg season, a debate among IFK supporters had started regarding a possible replacement of the then current anthem \\"Heja Bl√•vitt\\". Many different existing songs were proposed, from artists such as Maia Hirasawa, Nationalteatern and Troublemakers, until \\"Snart skiner Poseidon\\" was written by Joel Alme and posted on YouTube in mid-March 2009. His friend, bandmate (from H√§stpojken), and fellow IFK G√∂teborg supporter Pontus Tenggren had suggested he should write a new IFK song. Alme wrote the lyrics on a train home from Stockholm when he sat beside a woman crying as her husband had recently died. This inspired him to create a melancholic football anthem with more human character than the usual heroic and patriotic sports songs, stating in interviews that he \\"wanted to replace the clenched fist and testosterone with romance\\" and \\"at all costs [wanted to] avoid the feeling of Norwegian disco when it gets heroic, plastic and jaunty like that\\". The song name was proposed on the internet forum of Supporterklubben √Ñnglarna, and the supporters' association and IFK G√∂teborg soon decided to accept \\"Snart skiner Poseidon\\" as the new anthem. \\"Heja Bl√•vitt\\", the old anthem written in 1976, was replaced but lives on as the goal jingle of the club. Joel Alme performed the song live before IFK G√∂teborg's first match on the new Gamla Ullevi stadium on 11 April 2009. Release The song was released as a CD single on 7 April 2009, as digital download on iTunes on 6 December 2011 and on Spotify on 28 December 2011. Reception \\"Snart skiner Poseidon\\" reached number one position on the iTunes singles list after the digital release in late 2011, and the YouTube video had reached over one million views in June 2011, averaging more than 1,000 views per day since the original release. Sports journalist Erik Niva from Aftonbladet gave it a shared second place with a 4 out of 5 score in his ranking of the best Allsvenskan anthems at the start of the 2009 season, stating that writing a football anthem on command is difficult, but that Alme had \\"understood what this is about\\". Another journalist at Aftonbladet, music critic Markus Larsson, called it the by far best Allsvenskan anthem in 2012, writing that even people with no interest in sports would get chills from the song, and compared it to You'll Never Walk Alone. Musicologist Patrik Sandgren judged all Allsvenskan anthems in 2016, commenting that \\"Snart skiner Poseidon\\" is a somewhat awkward H√•kan Hellstr√∂m knock-off, while still rating it 4 out of 5, translating to a shared first place.

Before the Second World War  After having taught for some time at Pamiers, she relocated to Riom where she became a teacher at a secondary school for girls. On 28 August 1926 , Rodier married , a young ceramic engineer in Clermont-Ferrand. The couple had two sons, Jean (1927‚Äì2006) and Marc (1934‚Äì2008). In 1929, she and her husband started a ceramics business called () where she put to work her expertise in physics and chemistry.  During the Second World War  In 1939, United States embassy officials approached Rodier because of her background in atomic physics and offered her to immigrate to the USA. Confident in the future of France and concerned with the family business and her young children, she did not accept this offer. In 1940, after the available workforce diminished due to the large numbers of war prisoners detained in Germany, Rodier returned to teaching at the girls' school in Riom. = Arrest = Claude Rodier was arrested on February 8, 1944, with her husband, her two sons, and Pierre's father. Marc and his grandfather are released the same day. Rodier was held at the military prison of the 92nd Regiment of the French Infantry with the wife of General Andr√© Marteau and Marie Pfister, grandmother of the writer Patrick Raynal.

Upon a base of ceramic tile rests a slab of stone cut in the form of a menhir, containing a portrait of Claude Rodier in profile and topped with a bust of Pierre Virlogeux, both portraits being made by Virlogeux himself. The 19th century park along this avenue was also renamed square Virlogeux in their honor.

Family  *Jean Virlogeux (1927‚Äì2006) In 1940, as a French Scout, Jean participated in welcoming refugees into Riom. In 1943, he attempted, with a comrade, to join the maquis. Under the authority of his father, he participated in the Resistance in several capacities, including as a messenger and a receiver of airdrops. On the night of his arrest, February 8, 1944, Jean Virlogeux had just celebrated his seventeenth birthday. After his arrest, he was violently shaken, notably by Ursula Brandt. Transferred to the 92nd Regiment's barracks in Clermont-Ferrand, he began a journey which, as a deportee under the German Nacht und Nebel program, would take him to Compi√®gne-Royallieu (with a captivity in the Paris region to disarm bombs from the sorting station of La Chapelle), to the camp of Neuengamme, to the Kommando of Fallersleben, where he worked in Volkswagen factories as an electrical worker. 15 mois aux mains de la Gestapo et des SS.

It was founded by Al Ljutic and his wife Nadine in Reno, Nevada in 1959. History With his father, Al Ljutic ran the Ljutic Gun Company in the vicinity of Fresno. In 1955, AA Reil, a friend and Remington field rep, invited Al to go trap shooting the day after. Al realized after that he didn't own a trap gun. Instead of buying one Al designed and built one by the end of the day. This became the template for the Ljutic Space Gun. Ljutic Industries was founded in 1959 using a $500,000 settlement from Winchester Repeating Arms Company following Winchester's use of an Ljutic design. In 1960, the company changed its name from the \\"Ljutic Gun Company\\" to the current \\"Ljutic Industries.\\" In 1964, a fire in the Ljutic home/plant resulted in the company's relocation to Yakima. This led to a friendship with former Green Bay Packer end Dan Orlich who started trap shooting with Ljutic shotguns. This naturally resulted in increased interest in Ljutic shotguns. With 12-employees, Ljutic Industries production peaked at 340 shotguns a year in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, it quickly lost out to rivals such as Perazzi, Krieghoff, and Kolar Arms, shipping only 50 shot guns in 2007. By 2006, the company owed $1 million in taxes to the IRS, had discontent customers, and was close to shutting down. This led to its purchase from the IRS in September of that year by Jere Irwin of Irwin Research and Development for $250,000 and a small sum to the Ljutic family for company naming rights.

The emperor Jehangir continued M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh as the viceroy when he ascended to the throne in 1605. He continued to manage the province even though Khalij Khan was appointed as the new viceroy. He was succeeded by Sayad Murtaza who controlled the rebellions in north and south Gujarat. M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh again returned as the viceroy and successfully averted invasion of Malik Ambar from Daulatabad in south. The next viceroy Abdull√°h Kh√°n F√≠r√∫z Jang made expedition to south and subdued the Ahmednagar. During his time, in 1611, Jehangir permitted the British East India Company to establish factories in Surat and elsewhere in Gujarat. During the reign of the next viceroy Mukarrab Kh√°n, Jehangir toured Gujarat and received several local rulers. In 1618, he appointed his son prince Shah Jahan as the next viceroy. He rebelled in 1622‚Äì23 and he was replaced by Sult√°n D√°war Baksh. Shah Jahan resisted but later he managed the Jehangir's new appointment, Kh√°n Jah√°n as his own. Saif Khan had managed the province instead as Khan Jahan was sent as Shah Jahan's ambassador to Jehangir. Jehangir died and Shah Jahan succeeded him as the emperor in 1627. Viceroys under Jehangir (1605‚Äì1627) M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh, Ninth Viceroy, 1600‚Äì1606 In 1600, M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh was appointed the viceroy of Gujar√°t third time by Mughal emperor Akbar and Shams- ud-d√≠n Husain was appointed as his deputy to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In 1602, M√≠rza √Çz√≠z sent his eldest son Sh√°dm√°n as deputy; his second son Khurram as governor of Junagadh; and Sayad B√°yaz√≠d as minister. Khurram was afterward relieved of the charge of Sorath and Junaga·∏çh by his brother Abdull√°h. In 1605, Jehangir succeeded Akbar to the imperial throne. Shortly after his accession, Jehangir published a decree remitting certain taxes, and also in cases of robbery fixing the responsibility on the landowners of the place where the robbery was committed. The decree also renewed Akbar's decree forbidding soldiers billetting themselves forcibly in cultivators' houses. Finally, it directed that dispensaries and hospital wards should be opened in all large towns. In the early days of Jeh√°ng√≠r's reign disturbance was caused in the neighbourhood of √Åhmed√°b√°d by Bah√°dur a son of Muzaffar Sh√°h. Jeh√°ng√≠r despatched Patrd√°s R√°ja Vikram√°jit as viceroy of Gujar√°t to put down the rising. The R√°ja‚Äôs arrival at √Åhmed√°b√°d restored order. Some of the rebel officers submitting were reinstated in their commands: the rest fled to the hills. Kal√≠j Kh√°n, Tenth Viceroy, 1606 and Sayad Murtaza, Eleventh Viceroy, 1606‚Äì1609 On the R√°ja‚Äôs return, Jeh√°ng√≠r appointed Kal√≠j Kh√°n to be viceroy of Gujar√°t; but Kal√≠j Kh√°n never joined his charge, allowing M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh to act in his place. In 1606, on the transfer of M√≠rza √Çz√≠z to the Lahore viceroyalty, Sayad Murtaza Kh√°n Bukh√°ri, who had recently been ennobled in consequence of crushing the rebellion under Jeh√°ng√≠r‚Äôs son Khusrao, was entrusted with the charge of Gujar√°t, Sayad B√°yaz√≠d being continued as minister. Sayad Murtaza, who is said to have further ingratiated himself with the emperor by the present of a magnificent ruby, appears to have been more of a scholar than a governor. His only notable acts were the repair of the fort of Kadi and the populating of the Bukh√°ra quarter of Ahmedabad. During his tenure of power disturbances broke out, and R√°i Gopin√°th, son of R√°ja Todar Mal, with R√°ja Sursingh of Jodhpur, were sent to Gujar√°t by way of Malwa, Surat and Baroda. They overcame and imprisoned Kali√°n, chief of Belp√°r, but were defeated by the M√°ndwa chieftain, and withdrew to √Åhmed√°b√°d. R√°i Gopin√°th, obtaining reinforcements, returned to M√°ndwa and succeeded in capturing the chief. He then marched against the rebellious Kolis of the K√°nkrej, and took prisoner their leader, whom, on promising not to stir up future rebellions, he afterwards restored to liberty. The first connection of the English with Gujar√°t dates from Sayad Murtaza‚Äôs viceroyalty. In 1608, he allowed Captain Hawkins to sell goods in Surat. M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh, Twelfth Viceroy, 1609‚Äì1611 In 1609, the Kh√°n-i-√Åzam M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh was for the fourth time appointed viceroy of Gujar√°t. He was allowed to remain at court and send his son Jeh√°ng√≠r K√∫li Kh√°n as his deputy with Mohand√°s Div√°n and Mas√ªd Beg Hamad√°ni. This was the beginning of government by deputy, a custom which in later times proved problematic to the Mughal interests. ;Sack of Surat by Malik √Çmbar, 1609 In 1609 Malik √Çmbar, chief minister of Murtaza Nizam Shah II‚Äôs court and governor of Daulatabad, invaded Gujar√°t at the head of 50,000 horse, and after plundering both the Surat and Baroda districts retired as quickly as he came. To prevent such raids a body of 25,000 men was posted at R√°mnagar (near Dharampur) on the Dakhan (Deccan) frontier, and remained there for four years. This force included 4000 men from the Viceroy of √Åhmed√°b√°d, 5000 men from the Nobles of his Court, 3000 men from Baglan, 2500 men from the son of the chief of Cutch, 2500 men from Nawanagar, 2000 from Idar, 2000 from Dungarpur, 2000 from Banswada, 1000 from Ramnagar of Dharampur, 1000 from Rajpipla, 300 from Ali, 350 from Mohan (Chhota Udaipur. Abdull√°h Kh√°n F√≠r√∫z Jang, Thirteenth Viceroy, 1611‚Äì1616 In 1611, Abdull√°h Kh√°n Bah√°dur F√≠r√∫z Jang was appointed the thirteenth viceroy of Gujar√°t, with Ghi√°s-ud-d√≠n as his minister, under orders to proceed to the Dakhan (Deccan) to avenge the recent inroad. The viceroy marched to the Dakhan (Deccan) but returned without effecting anything. In 1616, he was again, in company with prince Shah Jahan, directed to move against Ahmednagar. This second expedition was successful. The country was humbled, and, except Malik Ambar, most of the nobles submitted to the emperor. During this viceroy‚Äôs term of office an imperial decree was issued forbidding nobles on the frontiers and in distant provinces to affix their seals to any communications addressed to Mughal servants. In 1611, the English East India Company sent vessels to trade with Surat. The Portuguese made an armed resistance, but were defeated. The Mughal commander, who was not sorry to see the Portuguese beaten, gave the English a warm reception. In 1612‚Äì13, a factory was opened in Surat by the English, and in 1614 a fleet was kept in the T√°pti river under Captain Downton to protect the factory. In 1615, Sir Thomas Roe came as ambassador to the emperor Jeh√°ng√≠r, and obtained permission to establish factories, not only at Surat but also at Bharuch, Cambay and Ghogha. The factory at Ghogha seems to have been established in 1613. The emperor Jeh√°ng√≠r notes in his memoirs that Mukarrab Kh√°n, viceroy from 1616‚Äì1618, regardless of cost had bought from the English at Ghogha a turkey, a lemur and other curiosities. On his return from Jeh√°ng√≠r‚Äôs camp at Ahmedabad in January 1618, Roe obtained valuable concessions from the viceroy. The governor of Surat was to lend ships to the English, the resident English might carry arms, build a house, practise their religion, and settle their disputes. The Dutch closely followed the English at Surat and were established there in 1618. Mukarrab Kh√°n, Fourteenth Viceroy, 1616 In 1616, on their return to Delhi, Mukarrab Kh√°n, a surgeon who had risen to notice by curing the emperor Akbar and was ennobled by Jeh√°ng√≠r, and who, since 1608, had been in charge of Surat or of Cambay, was appointed fourteenth viceroy of Gujar√°t, with Muhammad Safi as his minister. In the following year (1617), the emperor Jeh√°ng√≠r came to Gujar√°t to hunt wild elephants in the Dahod forests. But owing to the density of the forest only twelve were captured. Early in 1618, he visited Cambay which he notes only vessels of small draught could reach and where he ordered a gold and silver tanka twenty times heavier than the gold mohar to be minted. From Cambay, after a stay of ten days, he went to √Åhmed√°b√°d in hot season of March 1618 and received the R√°ja of √çdar. In his memoir, he contented himself with abusing its sandy streets, calling the city the ‚Äòabode of dust‚Äô (gard√°b√°d). After an attack of fever his dislike grew stronger, and he was uncertain whether the ‚Äòhome of the simoom‚Äô (samumist√°n), the ‚Äòplace of sickness‚Äô (b√≠m√°rist√°n), the ‚Äòthorn brake‚Äô (zakumd√°r), or ‚Äòhell‚Äô (jah√°nnam√°b√°d), was its most fitting name. Even the last title did not satisfy his dislike. In derision he adds the verse, \\"Oh essence of all goodnesses by what name shall I call thee.\\" Of the old buildings of √Åhmed√°b√°d, the emperor speaks of the Kankaria Lake and its island garden and of the royal palaces in the Bhadra. He notes that his Bakhshi had repaired the K√°nkaria lake and that the viceroy Mukarrab Kh√°n had partly restored the Bhadra palaces against his arrival. The emperor was disappointed with the capital. After the accounts he had heard it seemed rather poor with its narrow streets, its shops with ignoble fronts, and its dust, though to greet the emperor as he came on elephant-back scattering gold the city and its population had put on their holiday dress. The emperor speaks of having met some of the great men of Gujar√°t. Chief among these was Sayad Muhammad Bukh√°ri the representative of Sh√°h-i-√Ålam and the sons of Sh√°h Waj√≠h-ud-d√≠n of √Åhmed√°b√°d. They came as far as Cambay to meet the emperor. After his arrival in the capital Jeh√°ng√≠r with great kindness informally visited the house and garden of Sikandar Gujar√°ti the author of the MirƒÉt-i-Sikandari, to pick some of the author‚Äôs famous figs off the trees. Jeh√°ng√≠r speaks of the historian as a man of a refined literary style well versed in all matters of Gujar√°t history, who six or seven years since had entered the imperial service. On the occasion of celebrating Sh√°h Jeh√°n‚Äôs twenty-seventh birthday at √Åhmed√°b√°d, Jeh√°ng√≠r records having granted the territory from Mandu to Cambay as the estate of his son Shah Jahan (Prince Khurram). Before leaving Gujar√°t the emperor ordered the expulsion of the Sevadas or Jain priests, because of a prophecy unfavourable to him made by M√°n Sing Sewda. As the climate of √Åhmed√°b√°d disagreed with him, Jeh√°ng√≠r retired to the banks of the Mahi river. Here the J√°m of Nawanagar State came to pay homage, and presented fifty Kutch horses, a hundred gold mohars, and a hundred rupees, and received a dress of honour. The emperor now returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d, where he was visited by R√°i Bharmalji of Kutch, who presented 100 Kutchi horses, 100 ashrafis and 2000 rupees. The R√°i, who was ninety years of age, had never paid his respects to any emperor. Jeh√°ng√≠r, much pleased with the greatest of Gujar√°t Zam√≠nd√°rs, who, in spite of his ninety years was hale and in full possession of all his senses, gave him his own horse, a male and female elephant, a dagger, a sword with diamond-mounted hilt, and four rings of different coloured precious stones. As he still suffered from the climate, the emperor set out to return to Agra, and just at that time (1618‚Äì19) he heard of the birth of a grandson, Aurangzeb who was born at Dahod in Gujar√°t. In honour of this event Sh√°h Jeh√°n held a great festival at Ujjain. Prince Sh√°h Jah√°n, Fifteenth Viceroy, 1618‚Äì1622 Before the emperor started for √Ågra, he appointed prince Shah Jahan fifteenth viceroy of Gujar√°t in the place of Mukarrab Kh√°n. Muhammad Safi was continued as minister. As Sh√°h Jah√°n preferred remaining at Ujjain, he chose Rustam Kh√°n as his deputy; but the emperor, disapproving of this choice, selected R√°ja Vikram√°jit in Rustam Kh√°n‚Äôs stead. Shortly after, in 1622‚Äì23, Sh√°h Jah√°n rebelled, and in one of the battles which took place R√°ja Vikram√°jit was killed. Sh√°h Jah√°n, during his viceroyalty, built the Sh√°hi B√°gh and the royal baths in the Bhadra at √Åhmed√°b√°d. After the death of Vikram√°jit, his brother succeeded as deputy viceroy. Sult√°n D√°war Baksh, Sixteenth Viceroy, 1622‚Äì1624 While Sh√°h Jah√°n was still in rebellion, the emperor appointed Sult√°n D√°war Baksh, the son of prince Khusrau, sixteenth viceroy of Gujar√°t, Muhammad Safi being retained in his post of minister. Sh√°h Jah√°n, who was then at M√°ndu in Malwa, appointed on his part Abdull√°h Kh√°n Bah√°dur F√≠r√∫z Jang viceroy and a kh√°jahsara or eunuch of Abdull√°h Kh√°n his minister. Sult√°n D√°war Baksh, the emperor‚Äôs nominee, was accompanied by Kh√°n-i-√Åzam M√≠rza √Çz√≠z Kokalt√°sh to instruct him in the management of affairs. Prince Sh√°h Jah√°n had directed his minister to carry away all the treasure; but Muhammad Safi, who appears to have been a man of great ability, at once imprisoned the prince‚Äôs partisans in √Åhmed√°b√°d, and, among others, captured the eunuch of Abdull√°h Kh√°n. When this news reached the prince at M√°ndu, he sent Abdull√°h Kh√°n Bah√°dur with an army to Gujar√°t by way of Baroda. Muhammad Safi Kh√°n met and defeated him, and forced him to fly and rejoin the prince at M√°ndu. For his gallant conduct Muhammad Safi received the title of Saif Kh√°n, with an increase in his monthly pay from Rupees 700 to 3000 and the command of 3000 horse. Meanwhile, Sult√°n D√°war Baksh, with the Kh√°n-i-√Åzam, arrived and assumed the charge of the government, but the Kh√°n-i-√Åzam died soon after in 1624, and was buried at Sarkhej. Saif Kh√°n, Seventeenth Viceroy, 1624‚Äì1627 Sult√°n D√°war Baksh was re-called, and Kh√°n Jah√°n was appointed deputy viceroy with Y√∫suf Kh√°n as his minister. On his arrival at √Åhmed√°b√°d, prince Sh√°h Jah√°n employed Kh√°n Jah√°n in his own service, and sent him as his ambassador to the emperor. Saif Kh√°n, who acted for him, may be called the seventeenth viceroy, as indeed he had been the governing spirit for the last eight or ten years. He held the post of viceroy of Gujar√°t until the death of the Jahangir in 1627.

He founded the Konko-kyo Church of San Francisco in 1930 and was the head of the Konko Federation in North America. He was considered a Group A prisoner during World War II and was a vocal leader for Japanese prisoners during the internment of Japanese Americans.  Early life  Yoshiaki Fukuda was born in a village in Kitayama Village, Nara Prefecture, Japan, on July 22, 1898 to Kamejiro Fukuda and Kiwa Fusakabe.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 121. He served in the Japanese Army from 1918 to 1920, ranking as a second lieutenant. He attended Matsumoto College from 1921 to 1924 before enrolling at Japan's most prestigious college, Imperial University in Tokyo, which virtually guarantees success in business and government. Many of his classmates were successful businessman, government officials, and one was the Secretary of Defense. While at university, Fukuda had a relapse of tuberculosis he had contracted as a child and turned to the Konko Faith for guidance. He recovered and decided to forgo a career in the Japanese government, entering the Konko seminary after graduating in 1927. In 1930, Fukuda and his wife Shinko (n√©e Kimura), also a Konko minister, departed for the United States, settling in San Francisco and founding the Konko-kyo Church of San Francisco the same year.  Internment  Fukuda was arrested on December 7, 1941, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was classified as a Group A prisoner, who were, \\"Individuals believed to be the most dangerous and who in all probability should be interned in event of War.\\"Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 107. Thus, he was among the first Japanese to be arrested. Most other Japanese-Americans were not relocated until March 1942.  Missoula  Reverend Fukuda arrived at the Fort Missoula Internment Camp on December 29, 1941 with other Group A prisoners.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 9. Here, prisoners were interrogated by United States government officials regarding their \\"un- American\\" activities. At his hearing, Fukuda learned that the FBI had been tracking him for several years. They presented him with eight charges, including: close association with consul generals of Japanese Foreign Service; accommodating members of Japanese government, army, and navy; Meeting with the consul generals of Germany and Italy as well as presidents of both German and Italian Societies in San Francisco; being a reserve officer of Japanese army; holding receptions whenever Japanese navy ships visited San Francisco; sending food packages to Japanese army; visiting soldiers in Manchuria; being a member of Japanese Veterans Society.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 9-10. Fukuda repeatedly maintained that all of his communication was related to spreading the Konko faith to America. During his time in Missoula he went on a three week religious fast, losing 60 pounds.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 12.  Lordsburg  Fukuda was transferred to a camp near Lordsburg, New Mexico in May 1942.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 13. He led 5:30 morning services for Konko practitioners everyday, and regularly gave speeches to the camp, giving him considerable influence with both internees and soldiers. He quickly was appointed leader of his barrack.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 14. He was present at the Lordsburg killing of two internees, Toshiro Kobata and Hirota Isomura. They were shot at point blank range, and \\"the other internees in Lordsburg were forced to dig the graves of the two dead men\\". Fukuda wrote letters to the Spanish Consul and the Department of Justice, the branch controlling the Lordsburg Camp, demanding an investigation.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 154. . This eventually resulted in the guard's replacement from the camp.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 43. Fukuda routinely sent letters to these groups, along with the Red Cross and camp officials, when he saw mistreatment or other acts not in accordance with the Geneva Convention, which gave guidelines for prisoner of war treatment. Fukuda realized after this incident that many internees did not understand their rights under the Geneva Convention. Therefore he helped write and distribute copies to the approximate 1200 internees. According to his memoir, this helped the internees better understand and communicate with the camp guards.  Topaz  In February, 1943, Fukuda was granted special permission to be with his wife, who was in critical condition due to a heart condition, and his seven children at the Topaz relocation camp.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 49-50 This was the first time he saw them since his initial arrest in 1941. He continued to make speeches and conduct religious services regularly. He publicly stated that he thought issei (first generation Japanese immigrants) should stay loyal to Japan, while nisei (first generation Japanese-Americans) should be loyal to the United States, since they were United States citizens. This was a highly controversial statement, and it led to his expulsion from Topaz by July.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 163. . While at Topaz, Fukuda witnessed the stress on other families who were separated in different camps. Topaz was a relocation center run by the Department of the Interior in which Group B and C, or less \\"dangerous\\", Japanese-Americans were imprisoned.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. xi. Many families had members in the Department of Justice Camps such as Lordsburg, and the separation caused psychological harm to a good deal involved. Fukuda sent letters to many Japanese families urging them to apply for reunification at the Crystal City Internment Camp in Texas, the only Department of Justice Camp that housed families. While many had a stigma against these different types of camps, Fukuda argued that Crystal City had superior housing and education, given that it was the government's largest and \\"premier\\" camp.  Santa Fe  After being expelled from Topaz Fukuda was transferred to another camp in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 23, 1943.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 53. As before, he was seen as a person of influence and made the leader of his barrack. The internees in camp created a governing body which aimed at standing up for internees and for family reunification, of which Fukuda was a member. He also helped internee workers get wages from the Santa Fe camp authorities, and he set up a camp newspaper.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 15. Said William Kelly, assistant commissioner of the INS, \\"he (Fukuda) has shown himself in a number of ways to be a troublemaker. He was, without doubt, one of the leaders, if not the leader, of the element at Santa Fe which recently delivered several threatening ultimatums.\\"  Crystal City  Fukuda's request for family reunification was granted, and he was moved to Crystal City on February 10, 1944.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 164. . Upon his arrival, officer in charge Joseph O'Rourke immediately handed him a memo from the Department of Justice that said Reverend Fukuda was forbidden from giving public speeches and holding a position in the camp.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 156-157. . Even so, Fukuda still behaved in the same ways as he did in previous camps, holding mass for Konko believers and sticking up for internees. In Crystal City specifically, Fukuda requested to the government to supply a new tuberculosis drug to the camp hospital. This was granted, and resulted in almost all of the patients being cured.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 23. Due to his importance in the camp, as well as his influence feared by the US government, Fukuda was not released from imprisonment until September 29, 1947, over two years after the Japanese surrender of World War II.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 309. .  After the War  After the war ended, Fukuda stayed in Crystal City, serving as a minister, school principal, printer, and interpreter among other jobs. At this time, many issei, including himself, were issued deportation letters, and he wrote many petitions on behalf of these people to pardon them from deportation.Jarboe Russell, Jan (2015). The Train To Crystal City. New York, NY: Scribner. p. 306. . He served as an interpreter during a hearing on behalf of about 50 Japanese-Peruvians interned at Crystal City. The US wanted to deport them back to Peru, but Peru did not want them either. Fukuda offered to house them at his church in San Francisco until they found suitable employment, solving the matter.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 67. Once released, he once again focused on the growth of the Konko faith. Fukuda became a naturalized Unites States citizen in June 1955. He wrote a novel about his faith, entitled Live with Faith Being a Konko Believer, which was posthumously published in 1958.  Petition to President Eisenhower  Fukuda was still an important and active member in San Francisco's Japantown, and he witnessed the struggles that Japanese-Americans went through to reclaim lost properties, apply for or regain citizenship, and generally rebuild the lives they had before the war. He wrote a petition to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 10, 1957, in which he described these difficulties.Fukuda, Yoshiaki (1990). My Six Years of Internment: An Issei's Struggle For Justice. Konko Church of San Francisco. p. 31-74 He requested a change to the Evacuation Claims Act of 1948, which theoretically restored all lost property to Japanese-Americans, but was largely a failure. He requested compensation for those killed unjustly in the camps, which the government continued to hide. He included personal experiences, such as the loss of his fourth son Yoshiro, who died in 1946 at Crystal City after a battle with kidney disease. Fukuda believed that with medical attention available outside the camps, Yoshiro could have been saved. Fukuda never received a response from President Eisenhower. The United States government did not formally apologize and compensate former internees until 1988, 31 years after his petition.  Personal life  Reverend Fukuda and his wife, Shinko, had seven children. Fukada died suddenly of a heart attack on December 6, 1957. He was 59 years old. His family continues to be involved with the Konko Church.

These cells participate in innate defense mechanisms on mucous membranes. They are part of a heterogeneous group of cells that are divided into three groups - ILC 1, ILC 2 and ILC 3.Spits, Hergen, et al. \\"Innate lymphoid cells--a proposal for uniform nomenclature.\\" Nature reviews. Immunology 13.2 (2013): 145 Characterization of ILC 3 ILC 3 consists of two cell types - LTi cells (lymphoid tissue-inducing cells) that are important to produce secondary lymphoid organs in embryogenesis and cells designated as NCR+ ILC 3 and NCR‚àíILC 3 depending on whether they express NCR receptors of NK cells capable of recognizing pathogenic molecules. They produce cytokines typical for the population of Th17 helper lymphocytes. The characteristic feature of ILC 3 is the expression of the RORŒ≥t transcription factor, which is needed for its development and expression of the chemokine receptor CCR6. This group of ILC produces IL-17 (especially IL-17A) Takatori, Hiroaki, et al. \\"Lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells are an innate source of IL-17 and IL-22.\\" Journal of Experimental Medicine 206.1 (2009): 35-41. and IL-22.Cella, Marina, et al. \\"A human NK cell subset provides an innate source of IL-22 for mucosal immunity.\\" Nature 457.7230 (2009): 722. Both cytokines can be produced by ILC 3 simultaneously or separately, provided that when IL-22 is produced alone it is a matter of NCR+ ILC 3. ILC 3 express IL-23R and the production of IL-17 and IL-22 is stimulated by IL-23 and IL-1Œ≤.Cella, Marina, Karel Otero, and Marco Colonna. \\"Expansion of human NK-22 cells with IL-7, IL-2, and IL-1Œ≤ reveals intrinsic functional plasticity.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107.24 (2010): 10961-10966. For ILC 3, the expression of the transcription factor RORŒ≥t and partially also the Ahr (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) is typical since interactions of these two transcription factors cause the accumulation of ILC 3 and the production of IL-22 in the intestines.Qiu, Ju, et al. \\"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates gut immunity through modulation of innate lymphoid cells.\\" Immunity 36.1 (2012): 92-104. Function of ILC 3 ILC 3 represent a defense against extracellular parasites and are involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.Spits, Hergen, et al. \\"Innate lymphoid cells--a proposal for uniform nomenclature.\\" Nature reviews. Immunology 13.2 (2013): 145. They participate in effective antimicrobial defence through the production of IL-17 and IL-22. The role of IL-22 in humans and mice is somewhat different. In the murine model, IL-22 was found to play a role in improving the course of inflammatory bowel disease and epithelial restoration in the loss of the protective mucin barrier in the large intestine.Sugimoto, Ken, et al. \\"IL-22 ameliorates intestinal inflammation in a mouse model of ulcerative colitis.\\" The Journal of clinical investigation 118.2 (2008): 534.Sovran, Bruno, et al. \\"IL-22-STAT3 pathway plays a key role in the maintenance of ileal homeostasis in mice lacking secreted mucus barrier.\\" Inflammatory Bowel Diseases 21.3 (2015): 531-542. However, in humans with inflammatory bowel disease, IL-22 has an effect on the pathology of the disease.Andoh, Akira, et al. \\"Interleukin-22, a member of the IL-10 subfamily, induces inflammatory responses in colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts.\\" Gastroenterology 129.3 (2005): 969-984. IL-22 is an important cytokine for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The action of IL-22 helps enhance the defense of the surface of the intestinal mucosa by weakening the mucin layer and its ability to produce antimicrobial agents, such as Œ≤-defensins, is a powerful mechanism that helps maintain intestinal homeostasis.Liang, Spencer C., et al. \\"Interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-17 are coexpressed by Th17 cells and cooperatively enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides.\\" Journal of Experimental Medicine 203.10 (2006): 2271-2279. An increase in IL-22 levels together with increased Œ≤-defensin expression has been reported in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. IL-22, as well as IL-17, could thus be involved in the development of these skin diseases, since in humans without these problems IL-22 expression was not registered.Wolk, Kerstin, et al. \\"IL-22 increases the innate immunity of tissues.\\" Immunity 21.2 (2004): 241-254. The effects of IL-17 and IL-22 can complement each other and stimulate an increased amount of antimicrobial peptides at the site of action.Liang, Spencer C., et al. \\"Interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-17 are coexpressed by Th17 cells and cooperatively enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides.\\" Journal of Experimental Medicine 203.10 (2006): 2271-2279). Like ILC2, ILC 3 can express MHC II and be appropriating the function of antigen presenting cells.Hepworth, Matthew R., et al. \\"Innate lymphoid cells regulate CD4+ T cell responses to intestinal commensal bacteria.\\" Nature 498.7452 (2013): 113. However, ILCs lack the costimulatory receptors that are necessary for proper activation and initiation of the immune response. ILCs, on the contrary, may set the helper T lymphocytes in the state of anergy. In the case of ILC 3, the ability to express MHC II apparently serves to maintain tolerance to commensal bacteria in the intestine. They suppress the response of CD4 + T lymphocytes to harmless and beneficial intestinal bacteria. If this tolerance is not maintained, there can be a development of undesirable pathological conditions. On the other hand, the action of IL-23 or IL-17 is not always beneficial. It causes some autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosisMatusevicius, Dea, et al. \\"Interleukin-17 mRNA expression in blood and CSF mononuclear cells is augmented in multiple sclerosis.\\" Multiple Sclerosis Journal 5.2 (1999): 101-104. or rheumatoid arthritis.Ziolkowska, Maria, et al. \\"High levels of IL-17 in rheumatoid arthritis patients: IL-15 triggers in vitro IL-17 production via cyclosporin A-sensitive mechanism.\\" The Journal of Immunology 164.5 (2000): 2832-2838. IL-17A specifically targets keratinocytes and is the major cytokine causing pathogenesis of skin psoriasis.Lynde, Charles W., et al. \\"Interleukin 17A: toward a new understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis.\\" Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology 71.1 (2014): 141-150. In addition, IL-17A is also expressed to an increasing extent in patients with inflammatory bowel diseaseFujino, S., et al. \\"Increased expression of interleukin 17 in inflammatory bowel disease.\\" Gut 52.1 (2003): 65-70. ILC 3 may play a role already in the prenatal setting of the body's resistance to infections. LTi cells are important in the origin and development of secondary lymphoid organs. It has been found that differentiation and signalling of LTi cells are dependent on retinoic acid (a component of vitamin A). The uptake of retinoic acid in the diet by the mother directly affects the development of LTi cells and the size of the secondary lymphoid organs of the fetus, which may have an effect at its later agevan de Pavert, Serge A., et al. \\"Maternal retinoids control type 3 innate lymphoid cells and set the offspring immunity.\\" Nature 508.7494 (2014): 123.

The waterfall is known for a fish ladder that bypasses the waterfall to assist fish navigate the waterfall. Eagle Creek is known for being a point for fishing chinook salmon, bull trout, and steelhead trout. Upper Eagle Creek Falls is located upstream from the Eagle Creek National Fish Hatchery, a popular spot to start kayaking downstream Eagle Creek. Common waterfalls along the Eagle Creek Trail are listed below, including the popular Tunnel Falls.  Fires  On September 2, 2017, a wildfire started in Eagle Creek, affecting 45% of its forest, mainly the surface level. Before this there had never been a major fire affecting Eagle Creek land. Fortunately, the trails and campground were not disturbed. With the Eagle Creek fire on the news in September, the creek had more attention and exposure drawn to it, which may increase the number of visitors. The Eagle Creek Fire is an ongoing wildfire in the Columbia River Gorge in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington. The fire was started on September 2, 2017, reportedly caused by teenagers igniting fireworks during a burn ban. As of November 9, 2017, the fire had consumed 48,831 acres (19,761 ha) and was 50% contained. Fire growth was slowed by rain. In mid-September, highway closures and local evacuations were gradually being lifted. On November 30, 2017, the fire was declared fully contained but not yet completely out. With the fire closing I-84, for safety reasons loggers took down over 4,000, which ODOT (Oregon Department of Transportation) donated to the U.S. Forest Service to complete habitat and restoration projects. The fire affected private, state and national land.  Activities and general area  The Eagle Creek Park campground can hold 90 visitors and was made around 1930 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. From there, visitors can go kayaking in the creek, and hike to several falls such as Tunnel and Punch Bowl falls. From many points along the Eagle Creek Trail and the included waterfalls, the Cascade Mountain Range and the Columbia River Gorge are visible. The Eagle Creek trail-head is a busy place most weekends. Here sits the jump-off point for a half-dozen trails. In addition to Eagle Creek hikers, it accommodates PCT thru-hikers, locals who enjoy the day-use picnic area, site-seers enjoying the nearby fish hatcheries, and campers at nearby Eagle Creek Campground. The Eagle Creek trail-head has recently seen a great number of break-ins to cars. Thieves are known to frequent this area and work quickly. They tend to go for the obvious (valuables left in cars) but also for identity information left in glove compartments. It is an attractive area for thieves because of its proximity to the interstate on-ramp. In addition, hikers have even reported losing backpacks left at the trail-head momentarily while fetching their vehicle. Many hikers have taken to bringing all their valuables with them, leaving the doors to their car unlocked and the glove compartments open. There are signs posted that recommend you park at the lower parking area that you first pass by when you drive in from the freeway, next to the fish hatchery (where there are people 24/7, a window looks out onto the parking area) and during the summer there is a camp host. Parking here will add about a 1/2 mile to your hike.  History  The nonprofit Eagle Creek Park Foundation provides financial and volunteer assistance for the park, which was founded around 1910. Eagle Creek was created around 1930 by the Civilian Conservation Corps to be included in the Pacific Crest Trail. J.K. Lilly Jr. was the first to buy a piece of land that will be later called Eagle Creek Park in 1934. During the 1950s, she donated her Eagle Crest Estate, Eagle Valley Farms and East Crest Forest to Purdue University, which sold land to Marion County. Since Lilly was the first to buy, the park established a library in her honor within the Eagle Creek Park Nature Center in 1973. Five years later the Eagle Creek Park Foundation was established with a slim nine members. The Park Foundation provides park maps and daily and annual passes. It costs $1.50 to walk or bike through, and $5.00 to enter the park with a vehicle. To encourage seniors to enjoy the park, they don't need to pay for daily admission. The Foundation encourages outdoor learning and it monetarily supported the Ornithology Center with $4,500 and held an outdoor bird game for children.  Trail  The Eagle Creek trail was completed in 1983 and renovated in 1998. Currently, the trail is not able to be visited. Due to Eagle Creek Fire, most National Forest System lands in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area south of the Columbia River, east of Sandy River Delta, north of the National Scenic Area boundary, and west of Hood River have a legal closure in effect until further notice. More information can be found on the site USDA Forest Service Website. Eagle Creek is a creek in Hood River County, Oregon, United States. The creek drains into the Columbia River in Multnomah County, with its outlet on the Columbia River Gorge. It is in the Mount Hood National Forest. The Eagle Creek Trail ‚Äì the most popular trail in the Gorge ‚Äì follows the creek. Tunnel Falls and Punch Bowl Falls, located on Eagle Creek, are remote and scenic waterfalls along the creek. The Historic Columbia River Highway crosses the creek's outlet to the Columbia River. A substantial hike through some occasionally rough terrain is required to get to the creek's namesake waterfall. Eagle Creek Trail was built by the CCC and WPA in the 1930s for the Pacific Crest Trail, probably to cross the Columbia River at Bonneville Dam. The PCT was rerouted to its current route some 1.5 miles (2.4 km) further east sometime by the early 1970s to connect with the Bridge of the Gods across the Columbia River. Additional parking is available beside Cascade Fish Hatchery, located off exit 41 of eastbound Interstate 84 at the start of Eagle Creek Lane.

Its epicenter was about south of the city of Puebla. The earthquake caused damage in the Mexican states of Puebla and Morelos and in the Greater Mexico City area, including the collapse of more than 40 buildings. 370 people were killed by the earthquake and related building collapses, including 228 in Mexico City, and more than 6,000 were injured. The quake coincidentally occurred on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed around 10,000 people. The 1985 quake was commemorated, and a national earthquake drill was held, at 11 a.m. local time, just two hours before the 2017 earthquake. Twelve days earlier, the even larger 2017 Chiapas earthquake struck away, off the coast of the state of Chiapas. Background Tectonic plates of Mexico. Visible in the image is most of the North American continent, along with Central America. Mexico is located in the lower middle part of the picture, to the right of the Cocos plate. Mexico is one of the world's most seismically active regions, sitting atop several intersecting tectonic plates. The border between the Cocos Plate and North American Plate, along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, creates a subduction zone that generates large seismic events. Activity along the edges of the Rivera and Caribbean plates also generate seismic events. All together, these seismic forces cause an average of 40 earthquakes a day in Mexico. Mexico City is built on a dry lakebed with soft soil made up of sand and clay, which amplifies the destruction that major earthquakes cause. Loose sediments near the surface slow the shockwaves' speed from per second (8700 km/h) to roughly per second (160 km/h). This increases the shockwaves' amplitude, which causes more violent shaking. Deeper and denser soil layers increase amplified shockwaves' destructive duration. Less than two weeks before the Puebla earthquake, Mexico had been struck by an earthquake in Chiapas on 7 September, which killed almost 100 people. Despite its close timing, the Puebla earthquake was not an aftershock of the Chiapas event, as the epicenters were apart. The possibility of a link between the earthquakes was being investigated in the days after the second one. Big earthquakes can increase the long-term risk of seismic activity by transferring \\"static stress\\" to adjacent faults, but only at a distance of up to four times the length of the original rupture. In 19 September earthquake, static stress transfer was considered unlikely due to the distance between the earthquakes, in excess of the expected 400 km maximum. \\"Dynamic triggering\\", with seismic waves propagating from one quake affecting other faults, may operate at much longer distances, but usually happens within hours or a few days of the triggering quake; a 12-day gap is hard to explain. 19 September is designated as a day of remembrance for the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed approximately 10,000 civilians. Every year at 11 a.m., a national earthquake drill is conducted by the government through the use of public loudspeakers located throughout Mexico City. The 2017 drill took place as scheduled, at 11 a.m., around two hours before the central Mexico earthquake. Earthquake Video after the earthquake in Mexico City According to the National Seismological Service (SSN) of Mexico, the epicenter was located southeast of Axochiapan, Morelos, and from Mexico City. The earthquake was measured at a magnitude of 7.1, occurring at 13:14:40 Central Daylight Time, at a depth of . The United States Geological Survey (USGS) placed the epicenter ENE of San Juan Raboso and reported a measurement of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale; While there was a report of strong shaking for about one minute, which is a long time for an earthquake, Page added to frequently. acceleration/velocity/displacement seismograms at UNAM showed about 20 seconds of strong shaking with a period of ‚âà1 second. Frequently updated. SSN reported a peak ground acceleration of at the Popocat√©petl reporting station in Tlamacas, Estado de M√©xico. According to the USGS, the earthquake occurred on a moderately dipping normal fault. According to the bulletin of Mexico's SASMEX earthquake warning system, 20 seconds' advance warning was given in Mexico City; however the general experience in the capital was that the alarm and cellphone alerts started only a few seconds before, or during the quake. Some residents reportedly mistook the alert for a continuation of the earlier drill. 25 of the early-warning seismic sensors detected the earthquake, and alerts were also provided to Oaxaca, Acapulco, Chilpancingo, and Puebla, with lead times stated to range from 12 to 48 seconds.

At least 74 people were killed in the state of Morelos, 220 in Mexico City, 45 in Puebla, 13 in the State of Mexico, 6 in the state of Guerrero and one in the state of Oaxaca. In Mexico City, the bodies of 26 students and four instructors were pulled from the rubble of the Enrique C. R√©bsamen school; 30 students and 8 adults were still unaccounted for . The Mexico City campus of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education suffered damage, with at least 5 people killed and 40 injured. More than 6,000 people had been reported injured by the day after the earthquake, with more than 300 confirmed dead as Mexico earthquake rescue efforts continue. On 1 October the number of people known to have been killed was stated to be 361, with more than 4,500 injured. By place, 220 were killed in Mexico City, 74 in the state of Morelos, 45 in Puebla, 15 in Mexico State, six in Guerrero, and one in Oaxaca. An investigation published in October 2017 revealed that since 2012 there had been over 6,000 complaints about construction violations in Mexico City, with no public record of how many were followed up. Many of the buildings complained about collapsed in 19 September earthquake. After the earthquake the Urban Development and Housing Secretariat (Seduvi) did not respond to requests for information on responses to complaints. Local activists called the construction system totally corrupt, and said that some developers circumvent building regulations, and city authorities frequently ignore complaints. Article has many examples of violations of building codes, followed by buildings collapsing in the earthquake; for example a collapsed six-storey building that had been constructed on the foundations of a previous two-storey building. M√≥nica Garc√≠a Villegas, the owner of Colegio R√©bsamen in Mexico City where 26 people including 19 children died when the building collapsed, was found guilty on September 17, 2020 of \\"culpable homicide\\" for ignoring safety regulations. The Mexico City proscecutor (FGJ-CdMx) asked for 57 years of prison. The casualties included eight foreigners, including four Taiwanese women, a Korean man, a Spanish man, a Panamanian woman and an Argentine man. The actress Cecilia Su√°rez was injured while filming The House of Flowers in Condesa, Mexico City. Damage and aftermath In Puebla, church steeples had toppled in the city of Cholula, and a church on the slopes of Popocat√©petl in Atzitzihuacan collapsed during mass, killing 15 people. A second church, which was built in the 17th century, fell in Atzala during a baptism, killing 11 people including the baby. At least 44 buildings collapsed in Mexico City due to the earthquake, trapping people inside, creating large plumes of dust, and starting fires. At least 50 to 60 people were rescued by emergency workers and citizens. Several buildings caught fire. Condesa, Roma and del Valle neighbourhoods were among those most affected in the zone: a building located on √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n Avenue collapsed, and several buildings on √Åmsterdam Avenue suffered damage. The building housing the Philippine Embassy in Mexico City was badly damaged, requiring it to vacate the property. Gas leaks were reported, along with \\"piles\\" of rubble from collapsed buildings. Stock prices declined at the Mexico Stock Exchange but recovered before trading was suspended. Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad, the national electric utility, reported that 4.78 million customers lost power in Guerrero, Morelos, Puebla, State of Mexico, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala, and parts of Mexico City‚Äîroughly 35% of the company's customers in those states. However, none of the generating stations in the region sustained structural damage. Mexico City International Airport suspended operations while damage assessments took place, but reopened at 4:00 p.m. CDT (2100 UTC). 180 flights were cancelled or diverted during the closure. A plane carrying President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, returning from touring damage in Oaxaca from the earlier Chiapas earthquake, was diverted to Santa Luc√≠a Air Force Base. Mexico City Metro service was temporarily cancelled on several subway lines due to a power failure, but restored by 17:30, offering free service to stranded passengers. Building evacuations also caused delays to Metrob√∫s service in the city. The federal Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB) declared a state of emergency for all 33 municipalities of Morelos, for all 16 boroughs of Mexico City, and 112 of the 217 municipalities of Puebla. The declarations allow funds from the National Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN) to be used during the emergency response phase. The Mexican Army and Mexican Navy deployed 3,000 active-duty troops to Mexico City through the DN- III-E and Plan Marina emergency response plans. The troops were tasked with debris cleanup, search and rescue, and security missions. Additionally, the Secretariat of National Defence moved eight helicopters to Mexico City, and activated 3 shelters in the affected areas. A damage survey by American structural engineers revealed that a number of collapsed buildings had been erected in the 1960s and 1970s with unreinforced masonry walls confined by non-ductile concrete frames. All Round of 16 matches of the Copa MX, an association football cup competition, were suspended until further notice. The hashtag #FuerzaM√©xico (Be strong, Mexico) was used on social media outlets. Mexico's political parties offered to help victims in different ways, including the diverting some of the money they receive from the government for their campaigns. After months of debate and legal challenges, the donations were: PRI US$5,792,000, PAN US$2,479,000, PVEM US$524,000, Movimiento Ciudadano US$2,529,000, Encuentro Social US$506,000, PRD US$1,239,000, and Nueva Alianza US$2,081,000; Morena and PT did not specify how much they would donate. Although these amounts were not reported to the national election board Instituto Nacional Electoral. International response The fountain in Grand Park was lit up in Mexican flag in honour to the victims of the earthquake In response to the two major earthquakes in Mexico of September 2017, by the end of that month 501 rescue workers, 32 search dogs, equipment, and over 440 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been sent to Mexico from over 27 countries around the world. Among the countries that came to Mexico's aid were Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Germany, Honduras, Israel, Japan, Panama, Peru, Russia, Spain, South Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, the Vatican, and Venezuela, with aid coming from the United Nations and the European Union, as well. Russia delivered 35 tonnes of aid supplies to Mexico, including 24.5 tonnes of canned goods, as well as 64 community-sized tents. China shipped 3,000 tents along with more than 500 camp cots. Canada sent 1,500 family-sized tents. The Israel Defense Forces sent a group of 71 search and rescue soldiersIDF team heads home as Mexico quake rescue mission ends By STUART WINER and AP, 28 September 2017 including engineers, to help in the aftermath of the earthquake. The contingent had special dispensation to travel during the Rosh Hashanah holiday, normally forbidden under religious law. The Japan International Cooperation Agency sent a disaster relief team of 72 search-and- rescue personnel, four search dogs and five tons of equipment with personnel from the Japan Disaster Relief Team, Tokyo Fire Department and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police's SAR officers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country remarked that it was a show of thanks, as Mexico had sent a search team to help Japan during the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Turkish state aid agency Tƒ∞KA sent humanitarian aid ‚Äì including packages containing hygienic and medical supplies prepared in coordination with the Mexican Red Cross ‚Äì to Mexico City and Xochimilco. TIKA also provided tools and equipment to be used in search-and-rescue efforts. US President Donald Trump called Pe√±a Nieto to offer condolences, while the White House has offered search and rescue assistance. The U.S. Agency for International Development deployed an urban search and rescue team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department and experts from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to the affected regions. Celebrities who donated large sums include actress Salma Hayek ($100,000), Formula 1 driver Sergio Perez ($170.000), actress and singer Ana Brenda Contreras ($57,000), writer J. K. Rowling, singer Shawn Mendes ($100,000), Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg ($1,000,000), Apple CEO Tim Cook ($1,000,000), and others. Direct Relief, an emergency response organization, provided emergency response kits to a trauma hospital in southern Mexico City. They contained enough supplies to treat 1,000 people for a month. Direct Relief is also preparing shipments of medicines and medical supplies to improve its support to health care partners within the country.

This novel was published October 2, 2012 by New American Library, an imprint of Penguin Books USA.  Plot  The Hiding Place starts off at a park in the small town of Dove Point, Ohio where Janet Manning and her younger brother Justin Manning are sent to play alone. Janet loses track of her brother while playing with her own friend, she left him playing in the sandbox. When it's time to leave Justin has gone missing, no one is able to find him. Everyone has their own idea of how he went missing; he was chasing a dog and left the park in the direction of the forest. Or he was carried away by a man named Dante Rogers, an African American pedophile. 2 months after Justin Manning had gone missing, a boy's body was found in the forest outside of the park. They assumed this body belonged to 4 year old Justin, but they did not have the technology at the time to be completely sure. Dante Rogers went to jail for 20 years for the murder of Justin Manning. The police arrested and charged him as he had photos of children in his room. One of these children was of a blonde child, Justin Manning. Now, 25 years after Justin went missing, Janet is now 32 and she isn't sure what happened that day at the park.

It rolls, presses, and shapes dough into perfect circles.  History  In 1950, Daniel Thompson, son of Mickey Thompson, began designing an automatic bagel-making machine when he was 29. His father had been trying to make a working automatic bagel-making machine for most of his life to advance his baking business, and Daniel was following in his footsteps. In 1958, Daniel Thompson started construction of the first successful automatic bagel-making machine in his garage in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles. He called it ‚ÄúThe Thompson Bagel Machine‚Äù. A few years later, he patented his design. One year later, in 1961, he and his wife established the \\"Thompson Bagel Machine Manufacturing Corporation\\". Five years after he started construction of the bagel machine, he leased the successful and perfected design to Murray Lender, who owned a family-run bagel-making business. The first automated bagel-making machines were introduced to New Haven, Connecticut, Buffalo, New York, and St. Louis, Missouri in 1963, producing between 200 and 400 bagels per hour. The largest machines could produce as many as 5,000 bagels in an hour. Bagels had very quickly become extremely popular and were in an abundance supermarkets and restaurants because of Daniel Thompson‚Äôs bagel making machine. The price of the bagel has dropped significantly because they are now being mass produced everywhere in the world.  Impact  Before Thompson's automatic bagel-making machine was invented, making bagels was a slow process. Very few bakers actually made them. After the automatic bagel machine was invented, many more bagels were produced and the bagel became much more common. The automatic bagel-making machine popularized the bagel, leading to it being featured in many supermarkets and restaurants around the world. Today, far more bagels are being produced than ever before.  Use and features  The bagel machine automatically mass creates bagels by rolling the bagels, shaping the bagels, and pressing the bagels until they are a circular shape.

He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford on 8 April 1742, aged 17 and was awarded BA in 1745. In 1747, he joined the army and was an Ensign in the 3rd Foot Guards. He was then lieutenant and captain in 1753 and served in Germany during the Seven Years' War. Parliamentary career Molyneux succeeded his brother James as Member of Parliament for Haslemere being elected unopposed in a by-election in 1759.

Overview Impact craters on the surface of Venus (image reconstructed from radar data) If selected for development, VISAGE would have launched in December 2024 with a targeted flyby of Venus in May 2025, and Venus arrival in December 2025. A carrier spacecraft would deploy the lander five days before it flew by Venus. The atmosphere of Venus at the surface has an average temperature of 450 ¬∞C and is highly acidic and corrosive, which severely limits the time a lander can function. The VISAGE lander would function autonomously while descending (1 hour) and would operate on the surface for additional 3.5 hours, and it would transmit its acquired data to the nearby carrier module for relay to Earth.Venus In Situ Atmospheric and Geochemical Explorer (VISAGE): A Proposed New Frontiers Mission. (PDF) Esposito, L. W. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017) Science investigations During its parachute descent, the VISAGE lander would analyse atmospheric noble gases and light stable isotopes inventory, as well as reactive and trace gases, and measure the atmospheric structure profile. It would also image the surface starting from an altitude of and acquire panoramic images of the landing site. The VISAGE lander would drill on the shallow subsurface and samples would be brought on board to measure the mineralogy and elemental composition. Goals The proposed mission goals are: * to measure noble gases to test models of the origin and evolution of Venus, and measure sulfur compounds and trace gas profiles to constrain atmospheric cycles, surface-atmosphere interactions, and climate models. * to understand whether Venus was ever like Earth: VISAGE would measure surface and subsurface composition, determine surface rock type, mineralogy, and texture to understand geochemical processes, weathering, and aeolian processes. * to understand clues about exoplanets. Payload The proposed lander payload comprises five instruments: the Atmospheric Structure Investigation including Doppler Wind measurements, a Neutral Mass Spectrometer, an Imaging System, an X-ray Fluorescence experiment, and a Visible Near-Infrared Spectrometer. The total surface science data return is expected to be ~1.4 GBits.

It is most easily detected when the magnetic material is an insulator which eliminates other magnetically sensitive transport effects arising from conduction in the magnetic material.  Origins  Spin Hall magnetoresistance is one of many ways in which the electrical resistance of a material is influenced by the spin Hall effect. An electron moving through a conductor is scattered by the spin Hall effect in a direction determined by its spin orientation which induces a net accumulation of spin at the conductors edge. The spin polarized electrons at the conductors surface are able to interact with the magnetization of a magnetic material in close proximity through a spin- transfer torque. When the conduction electrons spin is aligned parallel to the magnetization direction the electron reflects from the conductor surface with no change in its spin, however, when there is a component of the magnetization that is normal to the spin orientation, the spin can be flipped to its opposite state transferring angular momentum into the magnetic material. This results in a spin current that travels at a normal to the direction of the charge current that can be altered by changing the direction of magnetization. This spin current is deflected through the inverse spin Hall effect which adds or subtracts from the electrons momentum in the direction of the charge current depending on the size and sign of the conductors spin Hall angle. This deflection provides an addition to the conductors resistivity allowing the spin current to be estimated by the change in the electrical resistivity.  Description  To construct a device that exhibits the spin Hall magnetoresistance, a multilayer of conductor and magnetic material is needed. Platinum is commonly used as a conductor due to its large spin Hall angle and YIG is used as a magnetic material with the conductor being deposited on top with a clean interface. The magnetization of the YIG can be rotated by an applied magnetic field strong enough to saturate it which results in a change in the conductors resistivity. The scale of the resistance change observed depends on the conductors spin Hall angle and the ratio of the spin diffusion length and the conducting materials thickness. As most spin diffusion lengths are short, the effect is only significant in materials that are only several nanometers thick.  Angular dependency  One of the signatures of the spin Hall magnetoresistance is that the change in resistance is observed when the magnetization of the insulator is rotated with respect to the spin axis and not to the direction of the charge current as is seen in anisotropic magnetoresistance. The change in resistivity follows a squared sine wave pattern when the magnetization vector is rotated about an axis that has a component normal to the spin axis. Platinum has been observed to have maximum resistivity changes of up to 0.12%.  Temperature dependence  In platinum the maximum resistance change is found to reach a maximum at approximately 120K for all thicknesses  Applications  Due to the spin-transfer torque at the interface of the conductor and magnet, a spin current can be injected from the metal into the insulator. This allows for new spintronics experiments to investigate the possibility of transmitting spin information through an insulator which would have the advantage of no power loss due to Joule heating.

History The development of Bofors first automatic weapons began in 1925 when the Navy requested the development of a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun. In 1928 the Navy requested a new 40 mm AA gun and a 25 mm AA gun which was produced in parallel and known as the M/32. Design A twin M/32 mount aboard HSwMS G√§vle The M/32 was designed with a barrel 64 calibers in length, fired a 25√ó205 mmR cartridge, at 160‚Äì180 rpm and with a muzzle velocity of 850 m/s. Later a shorter version firing a 25√ó187 mmR cartridge was produced in limited numbers. The M/32 looked similar to its larger 40 mm sibling and used the same long-recoil operating system and hydro-spring recoil mechanism. Its feed mechanism consisted of 6-round clips which were held in a vertical frame above the gun breech. Two clips were mounted side by side so that continuous fire could be maintained without the need to pause and change magazines. The clips were in two halves, which split and fell away as the cartridges entered the frames. The gun was available in fixed single mount, fixed twin mount or on a mobile four-wheeled carriage with twin collapsible outriggers. In addition to fixed pedestal mounts, a retractable gun mount was designed for submarine use. Although available in land mounts it was primarily a naval weapon.

It originated with the Clyde Workers Committee, the first shop stewards committee in Britain, which organised against the imprisonment of three of their members in 1915. Most of them were members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). In November 1916 the Sheffield Workers Committee was formed when members of the ASE there went on strike against the conscription of a local engineer. The government brought the strike to an end by exempting craft union members such as ASE engineers from military service. However when this policy was reversed in May 1917, this met by a strike involving 200,000 workers in 48 towns. The Shop Stewards Movement arose from organising this strike. In 1917, a National Administrative Committee was established for what was named the Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committees.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p.288 George Peet of the Manchester-based Joint Engineering Shop Stewards' Committee was elected as secretary, while Arthur MacManus of the Clyde Workers' Committee was chair, and J. T. Murphy from the Sheffield Workers' Committee was assistant secretary.Edmund Frow, Ruth Frow and John Saville, \\"Peet, George\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.170-173 Two months after the formation of the committee, it merged with a movement for the amalgamation of engineering unions, which had been founded in 1915 but had achieved little during the war. The organisation supported the October Revolution, and Peet represented it on the committee of the Hands Off Russia movement. The movement became gradually less active until 1920, when Willie Gallacher, David Ramsay, Ted Lismer and J. T. Murphy organised a national conference of the movement. The conference agreed to affiliate to the Communist International (Comintern).Graham Stevenson, \\"Lismer, Ted\\", Compendium of Communist Biography Gallacher, Murphy, Ramsay and Jack Tanner represented the group at the Second Congress of the Comintern, later in the year, but affiliation was not permitted, on the grounds that the organisation was not a political party.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p.133 Gallacher rejected suggestions that the movement should affiliate to the International Trade Union Council, a recently founded group of communist trade unions, arguing that it was necessary for members to remain active within mainstream trade unions. Instead, in September, a compromise was agreed: the movement would affiliate to the new Red International of Labour Unions, while individual members who also held membership of the new Communist Party of Great Britain would come under the discipline of that group.Reiner Tosstorff, The Red International of Labour Unions (RILU) 1920 - 1937, p.274 The Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committee became part of the National Workers' Committee in 1921, and it agitated unsuccessfully for a general strike on Black Friday. The National Workers' Committee in turn merged with the British Bureau in 1922, Peet remaining joint secretary for a year, after which the Comintern ordered that Gallacher and J. R. Campbell replace Peet and Lismer among the leaders of the movement.

Only one was built. Design and development The Pirata was designed by Antonio Ca√±ete and built in the workshops of the Spanish military base of Mar Chica at Melilla on the North African coast, construction starting in 1926. As Spain had no manufacturer of light alloys, Ca√±ete was forced to use galvanised iron in its structure. Its parasol wing was in three parts, with a span centre section and two outer panels. In plan, the complete wing was straight tapered with squared-off tips and had a thick section with a thickness-chord ratio of 16%. Its wooden structure was built around twin spars with ash flanges and pine webs and the wing was covered with plywood ahead and behind the spars and ply between them. A pair of parallel struts from the upper fuselage supported the wing spars at about mid-span. Ailerons spanned most of the outer panel's trailing edges. The Pirata was powered by a water- cooled Lorraine 12E Courlis W12 engine, with a choice between direct or geared-down drive, mounted in the wing centre section. Its oil tank, with radiators on its outer wall, was under the engine cowling between the spars but its two fuel tanks, each holding , were in the fuselage. The Pirata's hull had a single-step planing bottom and flat sides, built around galvanised-iron frames and covered with corrugated metal sheet thicker ahead of the step than behind. It was divided internally into five watertight compartments and stabilized on the water by a pair of long, unstepped floats placed apart. Each was mounted on a pair of struts from the top of the wing struts and another pair of struts from the upper fuselage. It had a crew of four in open cockpits. There was a gunner's position in the nose, equipped with a pair of Darne machine guns on a flexible mounting, with access to a hold containing of bombs. Pilot and flight engineer sat side by side in a second cockpit under the wing leading edge, from which the interior compartment of the hull holding the fuel tanks could be accessed via watertight doors. A dorsal gunner's post, similarly equipped to that in the nose, was under the trailing edge with a bomb store below. The Pirata's triangular profile fin was an integral part of the fuselage and carried a comma-shaped, balanced rudder. Its angular tailplane, mounted on the fin and braced from below on V-struts to the lower hull, carried split, balanced elevators. The fixed tail surfaces were, like the wing, wood-framed and ply-covered, but the control surfaces were steel- tube framed and fabric-covered. The date of the first flight of the Pirata is not known, but the aircraft and its designer were mentioned in 1927 and Les Ailes had an article on it planned almost a year before publication in September 1929. By then it had made many flights. Tests had shown that its handling was good and that performance was significantly improved when the engine was geared-down. Very little is known of its later history: there is no evidence of production and in Spain it would have been in competition with the Dornier Wal, which was being built locally from 1927.

It was announced at a press conference by Sony Interactive Entertainment prior to the 2017 Tokyo Game Show. Set in the Front Mission series, the story follows several individuals trying to survive amidst a surprise invasion of one country into another, along the way helping civilians to safety and to stop destruction and damage by mechanized war machines. Originally conceived as a strategy game, it gained more action elements as development proceeded, and ultimately became the first survival game in the Front Mission series. Some characters were conceived prior to the game's planning, and many changes to their appearances and ages occurred as the story was solidified. Left Alive received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. While many praised the graphics, story, and music, the game's controls were found to be stiff and unresponsive. The artificial intelligence of the enemies, physics, and voice acting were also criticised. Gameplay As an example of the game's poor physics, enemies exhibit a kind of jumping behavior as they are shot. Left Alive is a primarily stealth-based third-person shooter, with survival game elements as well. Players spend most of their time trying to evade enemies and create improvised weapons when stealth fails or is not an option. Activities include guiding survivors to safe houses, crafting weapons, and planning the takedown of wanzers. Other players who did not survive a game stage exist in a players play through and their bodies can be searched for equipment. Players occasionally have the opportunity to take control of Wanzers and do great damage to their enemies. During interactions with civilians and other NPCs, there will be dialogue choices that the player can choose.https://www.dualshockers.com/left-alive-review-ps4-pc/ Leonid in a dialog conversation sequence in the start of his level talking to Koshka. Players are guided by Koshka, a Rutherian command and control AI which warns players when enemies come close. Weapon crafting includes creating improvised explosive devices, traps, and different kinds of explosives from scrounged materials. Players guide survivors to the safe houses by issuing commands on the map screen. Plot The story takes place in the Front Mission series during a conflict between two countries, Ruthenia and Garmoniya, in what was formerly Ukraine. The game breaks the story into fourteen chapters and three characters individual stories. Players begin as Mikhail, who is a Ruthenian wanzer pilot who must survive the loss of his wanzer and fellow soldiers. The next character is Olga, a police captain and former soldier of the Garmoniyan Army before the city she lives in became part of Ruthenia. The last character is Leonid, a former Novo Slava rebel leader accused of murder. The plot begins with a surprise invasion by Garmoniya into the Ruthenian city of Novo Slava on the border between the two countries, the same city Olga works in. All 3 protagonists are supported by Koshka, the Ruthenia military's logistics and communications A.I. system. After the rest of his unit is killed, Mikhail meets Patrick Lemaire, an agent of the Unified Continental States (UCS) posing as a journalist, who recruits him into investigating a conspiracy involving an advanced prototype wanzer and a virus known as MODS, both of which were secretly being developed in Ruthenia by rogue officials. Patrick explains the true reason for the invasion is because Garmoniya is secretly acting on behalf of the Republic of Zaftra and its secret ruling body Semargl, who wish to obtain the virus and the wanzer. As the invasion begins, Olga encounters a young orphan named Julia, who she pursues in an attempt to save her from a human trafficking ring run by the Garmoniyan military. Olga discovers Julia is a survivor of a Semargl research project in which victims were infected with the MODS virus. Leonid, who was framed for the assassination of Novo Slava's liberator and national hero Ruslan Izmailov, escapes during the invasion. He learns that Ruslan is still alive and is actually a deep cover Semargl agent. Seeking revenge, Leonid pursues Ruslan and kills him. However, Olga later witnesses an inexplicably alive Ruslan appear and capture Julia on behalf of Semargl. The three protagonists meet up with each other and head downtown to reach a rescue helicopter sent by Patrick. Olga goes off to rescue Julia, while Mikhail hijacks a unattended Wanzer to create a distraction. On his way to the rescue helicopter, Leonid encounters Ruslan, who is revealed to be a cyborg. After a final confrontation, Ruslan is killed permanently and the three protagonists are picked up by Patrick's rescue helicopter, as an international peacekeeping force arrives to take control of Novo Slava. If all 30 civilians and 4 major supporting characters the protagonists encounter through the game survive, a secret ending will play in which Ruslan reveals to Leonid during their final confrontation that Semargl possesses a computer system called M3, which has the ability to predict the future. M3 predicted that human overpopulation caused by the prosperity it would create would lead to humanity's decline, so Semargl planned to use the MODS virus, which primarily kills the elderly, as a means of population control to avert this. An after-credits scene shows Koshka uploading all data acquired from the invasion of Novo Slava to M3, before \\"proceeding with the next phase\\". Development Left Alive was developed by Japanese developer Ilinx and produced by Square Enix. It was directed by Toshifumi Nabeshima, who previously directed some of the games in the Armored Core franchise. Shinji Hashimoto, who helped produce entries in both Front Mission and Square Enix's Final Fantasy series, served as producer for Left Alive. The game's promotional art was created by Yoji Shinkawa, known for his work on the Metal Gear series. In addition to overseeing the design of some of the models, Shinkawa did character designs of the three main protagonists, as well as one of the Wanzer mecha models. He drew concept art of some of the other characters. Artist Takayuki Yanase, who worked on Xenoblade Chronicles X, also contributed Wanzer designs. When development began, the development team initially conceived of the title as a strategy game, but it became more of an action title under Toshifumi Nabeshima's influence. Nabeshima originally thought that the game would revolve around mech robots fighting each other due to the title's Front Mission roots. However, when he learned that players would be controlling people, and fighting against wanzers, Front Missions term for mechs, he considered giving them some kind of power or guard suit. Later on in development, the game took a very different turn toward a survival mechanic. Artistically, Nabeshima had the design team review his artwork to make sure he was remaining faithful to the Front Mission aesthetic. He also created a character with inspiration he found through the artwork of the original Front Mission artist Yoshitaka Amano, who is also one of his favorite artists. Artist Yoji Shinkawa drew the three main characters based on a simple profile, and then began submitting rough sketches of the character Leonid for consideration since that was a character type he was very familiar with. He then proceeded to design the characters, always checking to see that he was maintaining a balance between them. He also did sketches for the game's other key characters, and also designed one of the wanzers. The mechs did not have to look like traditional \\"Zenith-type\\" wanzers from Front Mission, just \\"powerful/formidable\\", so Shinkawa designed purely from his own imagination. Shinkawa advised on the 3D graphics and how they looked in motion. Shinkawa notes that he adjusted designs with developer feedback for each character about three to four times. There was much discussion for the direction of the character Mikhail, with him first being conceived as middle aged, but then young and handsome, necessitating a redesign. His personality began as conceited, like one who had an affluent childhood, but as his dialogue made him a more \\"honest and earnest\\", his design changed again. Prior to story development, Yoji Shinkawa already had some characters who existed in the Front Mission series in development. In developing the game, the team discussed prioritizing a sense of reality for the story. This led them to make the setting the present world, but with all the countries names changed. The designers also decided that a very realistic plot that would still feel like Front Mission would involve several characters dealing with ‚Äúevil conspiracies‚Äù caused by nations plotting against each other. Composer Hidenori Iwasaki worked on the music, drawing from his experiences as the composer for some of the music in previous Front Mission games. Orchestrator Jordan Seigel and audio engineer Shinnosuke Miyazawa also helped work on the soundtrack, which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Release The game was announced in September 2017 at the Tokyo Game Show, with an intended release year of 2018. In September 2018, Square Enix announced a Japanese release date of February 28, 2019. The following month, Square Enix announced that the game would be released outside of Japan on March 5, 2019. People who pre-ordered the game received five desktop wallpapers, a downloadable content pack, and a sample soundtrack. A special edition called the \\"Mech Edition\\" was also released that included everything in the pre-ordered version, along with an action figure of a Wanzer designed by Yanase and an official artbook. As part of promotions, Square Enix collaborated with Japanese rock band Man with a Mission to release a song called \\"Left Alive\\" on the Japanese release date of February 28. On the day the game was released worldwide, Square Enix launched a free downloadable content pack for Left Alive. This \\"World of Tanks Collaboration\\" pack contained only in-game advertising for World of Tanks. Reception Left Alive received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, approximately 17,622 physical units for PlayStation 4 were sold during its launch week becoming the number five selling game of any format. IGN called the game a \\"failure on every level\\", with poor controls and game balances issues cited along with technical glitches. Game Revolution praised the setting and plot, but noted a wildly changing enemy intelligence what would either never miss or ignore the player completely. GameSpot praised the opening and some of the character dialogue, but explain that the lack of story setup at the beginning lead to large plot revelations having no emotional impact. Destructoid praises the game's soundtrack and art direction, but highlighted the low resolution graphical textures that gave the game a \\"drab\\" look. They also noted \\"laughable\\" enemy physics, where killed enemies' bodies would jump in the air however they died. They further describes voice acting as \\"varied\\", from decent, to sounding like the actors \\"gave up\\" after one take. Kotaku loved the idea of urban warfare, including searching for improvised weapons to take on war mechs, but the game's \\"stiff\\" and \\"sluggish\\" controls made the game impossibly hard to play. Heather Alexander of Kotaku did find some things to praise however, saying the game \\"drips with style and mood\\". Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation ranked it as the second worst game of 2019.

History in the United States Until the twentieth century, there were no prohibitions in the U.S. against growing and consuming cannabis. By the mid twentieth century, possession of marijuana was a crime in every U.S. state (and most other countries). In 1996, the passing of Proposition 215 by California voters restored limited rights for medical cannabis patients in the state. Other states and countries have since joined California in guarding rights of cannabis consumers. In the United States, much is unclear about cannabis rights because despite state laws, cannabis remains federally illegal. Consequently, cannabis consumers do not belong to a protected class. Courts will address the issues surrounding housing and employment law, and disability discrimination.  Medical use  In the United States, the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legal in 33 states, four (out of five) permanently inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.[11] An additional 14 states have more restrictive laws allowing the use of low-THC products.[11] Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level by way of the Controlled Substances Act, under which cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. In December 2014, however, the Rohrabacher‚ÄìFarr amendment was signed into law, prohibiting the Justice Department from prosecuting individuals acting in accordance with state medical cannabis laws. An international argument for medical usage includes the right to health, as guaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. However, what determines \\"health\\" or \\"healthy\\" is disputed between individuals and governmental bodies.  Legality  The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is prohibited in most countries; however, many have adopted a policy of decriminalization to make simple possession a non-criminal offense (often similar to a minor traffic violation). Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years.  State vs. federal  As of 2019 in the United States, eleven states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, with 25 more states decriminalizing the drug. However, fourteen states and federal law still classifies cannabis as illegal, placing cannabis as a \\"Schedule 1\\" drug. Being federally illegal, profits cannot be handled through federally-insured banks (including checks or deposits), so cannabis retailers are forced to use cash or remain vague about business practices.  Religious use  Different religions have varying stances on the use of cannabis, historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an entheogen, particularly in the Indian subcontinent where the tradition continues on a more limited basis. In the modern era Rastafari use cannabis as a sacred herb. Meanwhile, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of medicinal cannabis.  Social movement  The movement around cannabis laws and rights has been growing since as early as the 60‚Äôs. Multiple organizations both for and against cannabis usage have been created and merged over the past 60 years as the country has changed and perception of marijuana rights has changed. One pro-marijuana group is NORML (The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws). The conversation about cannabis rights has shifted from picket signs declaring \\"Pot is fun,\\" to being about health and social justice. It's been noted that African-American communities may be suffering the most from the continued prohibition of cannabis, although consumption rates are approximately the same as white citizens. Arrests for African-Americans are 3.73 times higher in comparison. Activists hope to see those numbers decrease with gained rights.  Indonesia  There were around two million cannabis user in Indonesia in 2014, reported by the National Anti-Narcotics Agency (Badan Narkotika Nasional - BNN). This makes cannabis the most popular drug in Indonesia followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) such as methamphetamine (shabu) and ecstasy. Most of the cannabis is distributed by the western province of Indonesia called Aceh. 37,923 people were imprisoned because of cannabis between 2009 and 2012. Twenty-six people were imprisoned, on average, each day. Because cannabis is the most common drug, consuming of cannabis goes up to 66 percent than other drugs in the country. The death penalty is given to the people who grow cannabis, or a minimum fine of $550,000, based on the National Anti-Narcoticts (BNN) law.

The British Royal Navy used her briefly that year. She is last listed in 1805. Capture Cambrian captured the French privateer schooner Mathilde on 3 July 1805, after a chase of 22 hours. Mathilde, of 200 tons, was armed with twenty 9-pounder guns and had a crew of 95 men. She surrendered in shoal water and if not for the efforts of Lieutenant Pigot in one of Cambrians boats, Mathildes entire crew might have been lost. Mathilde had earlier captured the letter of marque Clyde, which had been on her way to Liverpool. Prior to her capture by Cambrian, Mathilde had evaded capture by Heron. Action of 7 July Captain Beresford of Cambrian appointed Lieutenant Pigot commander of Matilda, and used her as a tender. On 7 July Lieutenant Pigot again distinguished himself. He arrived off the harbour of St. Marys, Georgia the day before and took Matilda twelve miles up the St Marys River to attack three vessels reported to be there. All long the way militia and riflemen fired on Matilda. Eventually the British reached the vessels, which were lashed in a line cross the river. They consisted of a Spanish privateer schooner and her two prizes, the ship and the British brig Ceres, which the Spanish privateer had captured some two months earlier. The Spaniards had armed Golden Grove with eight 6-pounder guns and six swivels, and given her a crew of 50 men. The brig too they had armed with swivels and small arms. The Spanish schooner carried six guns and a crew of 70 men. Pigot engaged the vessels for an hour, and after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and captured Golden Grove. The British then captured the other two vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired on a group of 100 militia and a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to his head and one to a leg. Spanish casualties were reportedly 25 men killed (including five Americans) and 22 men wounded. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle. Pigot was unable to extricate himself and his prizes from the river until 21 July, but during the entire period he remained in command except when he was getting his wounds dressed.

She studied the Grand Canyon, Walnut Canyon and then resided in Boulder, Colorado where she continued to study the Rocky Mountains.  Early life  Halka Chronic was born in Tucson, Arizona on February 26, 1923. She was born to Sidney F. and Marylka Modjeska Pattison as Helena Bainbridge Pattison. Halka spent her childhood summers in Corona Del Mar, California with her mother, an artist, and her brother, Karl. In her early life she took trips across the country to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. She developed her passion for traveling and sailing, as well as her skill as a watercolor painter, during these travels with her family. Halka attended the University of Arizona and Stanford University, and she received her Ph.D in Geology from Columbia University in 1949. Halka chose to focus on the fossils of Walnut Canyon, Arizona while earning her Ph.D. Halka spent a summer working with geologist Edwin McKee in the Grand Canyon during the 1940s, work that built the foundation of her future in geology. Halka Married John Chronic in 1948, and moved to Boulder, CO soon after her graduation and their wedding. Halka and John raised four daughters. Travels The couple was based in Boulder, Colorado, but Halka and her husband traveled frequently, spending a year at a time in Scotland, Ethiopia, Australia, and Puerto Rico. Although the couple eventually separated, Halka continued traveling on her own to Mexico, Norway, Poland, China, and Latin America. She also drove the Alaska Highway four times. While in Ethiopia, Halka taught at Haile Selassie University. While in Sydney, she began writing geology books. She also worked as a scientific editor for the Geological Society of America. During a cross country trip, she wrote the Roadside Geology Books for Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. Career and awards Halka began her career at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona. After this she taught at the University of Michigan- Summerfield Campus.

His grandfather had been MP for Hertfordshire and his father, a younger son, was a London merchant in the Hamburg trade. His father in 1739 had inherited the family estates on the death of his elder brother. Halsey himself joined his father in the business, and in or before 1759 he went to Hamburg as a member of the firm of Hanbury and Halsey. In 1760 while still out there, he was appointed a commissary of control to the army under Prince Ferdinand which involved examining the execution of contracts. In 1762 he succeeded to the family estates on the death of his brother, and in February 1763 returned to England where he settled down as a country gentleman. In 1768 he began the building of Gaddesden Place. It is a large Palladian villa, which is said to be the first work of the architect James Wyatt.

This amiable character, however, in private life, has so endeared him to his constituents, that notwithstanding several gentlemen of the first opulence in the country have attempted to supplant him, and have promised a stricter attention to the duties of so important a trust; their efforts have, hitherto, proved totally nugatory ...

Founded by three Benedictine nuns from St. Andrew's Abbey, Sarnen, Switzerland who immigrated in 1882, it was designated the motherhouse for the community in 1909. Its main building and chapel were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Gertrude's Convent and Chapel in 1979. History The community traces its history to Mother Johanna Zumsteinn and Sisters Magdalene Suter and Rosalia Ruebli, who left Sarnen on September 26, 1882, eventually reaching Gervais, Oregon. They established convents and schools in Uniontown and Colton, Washington, and staffed schools in Cottonwood and Genesee, Idaho, as well as conducting other missions in eastern Washington state and northern Idaho. In 1909, John Uhlenkott, whose two daughters had both joined the convent, invited the sisters to relocate to Cottonwood and start a school, donating 10 acres for the purpose on a promontory overlooking the town. Jakob Engelbert Gier of Mt. Angel, Oregon was commissioned to design the chapel and convent building. A German immigrant, Gier had designed St. Mary's Church in Mount Angel, and may have become known to the nuns during their time in Oregon. Construction began in 1919 and was completed in 1924. Given the labor shortage in the area following World War I, some of the resident nuns helped quarry and transport the stone to the building site. The community continued to operate schools throughout Idaho over the next half-century, including St. Gertrude's Academy in Cottonwood, which closed in 1970. The former campus is now home to Prairie Junior/Senior High School. The community celebrated its centennial in 2009. Architecture Chapel exterior The historic structure consists of a basilican chapel plus a convent wing. The chapel has two high corner towers capped by basilica roofs of red shingle tile and gold crosses. With . The towers house bells honoring the Sacred Heart and saints Joseph, Michael (archangel), and Gabriel. The statue in the niche between the towers depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The two-foot-thick walls of local blue porphyry are characteristic of the Romanesque Revival style. The structure rests on a three-quarter-story stone foundation, with a grand stairway leading to the balustraded front entry porch, presenting an imposing view. The chapel is divided along its length into seven bays supported by abbreviated buttresses, with a two-story arched window and oval window above in each bay, with surrounds of locally-made brick. The statue in the niche above the chapel's rear entry is of Saint Gertrude of Helfta, to whom the nunnery is dedicated. The chapel's interior is richly decorated with hand-carved pieces. The high altar, a gift from a brother of one of the founding sisters, was built in 1928 in Sigmaringen, Germany, \\"by a company whose master recently had been awarded the insignia \\"Pro Papa Et Ecclesta\\" (for the Pope and Church) for outstanding service to the cause of religious art. This distinction is rarely conferred and this man was, as far as is known, the only one so honored in Germany up to that time.\\" The side shrines were preserved from the original wooden building, purchased from the Philips Company of Dubuque, Iowa, in 1909.

Life Marion Chalmers was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 26 August 1911. From 1919 to 1939 she lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In August 1939, she, her husband (Guthrie Armour Patterson, born 29 January 1904 in Dundee, Scotland) and son (Douglas Patterson, born 8 October 1932 in Toronto), moved back to Aberdeen. After the Second World War broke out Patterson enlisted as an Ambulance Driver. In October 1942, she became a Senior Fire Guard for the Civil Defence Service in Aberdeen. She died on 14 August 1993 in TorontoOttawa War Museum Recognition for bravery On 7 August 1942, while on duty, Patterson was helping to extinguish a burning building when she heard cries for help coming from under some walls that had collapsed. She managed to get to the sailor who was trapped below and free him. He was too weak to help. A rope was lowered through the damaged walls and she was able to tie the rope around the sailor‚Äôs waist and with help got him out of the burning building. The building collapsed less than a minute later. On 4 December 1942, after the incident was written up in the London Gazette, she received an invitation to attend Buckingham Palace on 12 February 1943 to receive a presentation of the George Medal by King George VI. Patterson was the first street fire-guard to win a medal while engaged in fire duties. As part of the award, she was also selected for portraiture in a special section of the National Gallery of England set aside for heroes and heroines of the Blitz. Patterson was also invited to be a guest at Balmoral Castle for the remainder of her life. The Scottish artist Robert Sivell was commissioned by King George VI to paint Patterson‚Äôs portrait. Patterson attended Buckingham Place again for the presentation of the portrait. The original was hung in the National Gallery, London and was displayed in a special wing for Heroes and Heroines of the 1939-1945 War. Patterson also received two replicas of the portrait and a sketch in black and white. One replica is in the Ottawa Canadian War Museum and was on display as part of the Women At War exhibit at the museum in 1985.

It was constructed by the Jesuits during the settlement of Pernambuco and destroyed during the Dutch occupation of Brazil. The church was rebuilt late in the 16th century and sits adjacent to the Church of Saints Cosme and Dami√£o, the oldest functioning church in Brazil. It was designated a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1950. History Construction of the Church and Convent of Saint Antony began during the early period of Jesuit activity in Pernambuco in the mid-16th century. Igarassu became the second- most important city in Pernambuco before the Dutch occupation of Brazil. The church and convent were completely destroyed during the Dutch occupation. Reconstruction of the church and convent began in 1654 and concluded in 1693. The Church and Convent of Saint Antony no longer conducts religious services; it was converted into a sacred art museum. The church and convent are located in the Historic Center of Igarassu. Structure The Church and Convent of Saint Antony is built in the Baroque style common to the period. The fa√ßade dates to 1660 and was subsequently renovated. It has three arches at its first level with a single door into the nave. Three rectangular windows are at the choir level above the entrance with red shutters. A renovation in the mid-18th century resulted in the addition of richly designed interior design elements: engraved tiles, painted and carved furniture, a painted ceiling, a new sacristy, and curved wall segments, and architectural feature rare to the Northeast region of Brazil. The church also has a large washbasin made of stone imported from Portugal. The church now function as a museum of sacred art, commonly known as the Igarassu History Museum.

History In 1845, when studying phonography in Stephen Pearl Andrews' and Augustus F. Boyle's class, Boston, Carney was asked to give an impromptu exercise on the blackboard. Only ten minutes were allowed, and in that time, she wrote the first verse of \\"Little Things\\". It became a favorite of children in Sunday school exhibitions from that time on, and was recited and sung thousands of times. It was first published in a Sunday school paper, Gospel Teacher (renamed, Myrtle). Soon after her phonographic poem was published, it appeared in the Methodist Sunday-School Advocate, with an additional verse about missionary pennies, to which she laid no claim. This poem came to be published uncredited as a children's rhyme and hymn in many 19th century magazines and books, sometimes attributed to Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, Daniel Clement Colesworthy, or Frances S. Osgood, but the earliest publications of it clearly are those of Carney. A later final verse read: This was quoted in Hanson's Our Woman Workers: Biographical Sketches of Women Eminent in the Universalist Church for Literary, Philanthropic and Christian Work (1881) These were the final words of the poem in the original publication, but later versions published anonymously by other authors appended various additions to this.

They clarify the country's sex trafficking law to make it illegal to knowingly assist, facilitate, or support sex trafficking, and amend the Section 230 safe harbors of the Communications Decency Act (which make online services immune from civil liability for the actions of their users) to exclude enforcement of federal or state sex trafficking laws from its immunity. Senate sponsor Rob Portman had previously led an investigation into the online classifieds service Backpage (which had been accused of facilitating child sex trafficking), and argued that Section 230 was protecting its \\"unscrupulous business practices\\" and was not designed to provide immunity to websites that facilitate sex trafficking. SESTA received bipartisan support from U.S. senators, the Internet Association, as well as companies such as 21st Century Fox and Oracle, who supported the bill's goal to encourage proactive action against illegal sex trafficking. SESTA was criticized by pro-free speech groups for weakening section 230 safe harbors, alleging that it would make providers become liable for any usage of their platforms that facilitates sex trafficking, knowingly if they moderate for such content, and with reckless disregard if they do not proactively take steps to prevent such usage. SESTA was incorporated into the House version of the bill with the \\"Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act\\" (FOSTA) and the joint proposal was known as the \\"FOSTA-SESTA package\\". On February 27, 2018, the FOSTA-SESTA package was passed in the House of Representatives with a vote of 388‚Äì25. On March 21, 2018, the FOSTA-SESTA package bill passed the Senate with a vote of 97‚Äì2, with only senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul voting against it. The bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump on April 11, 2018.  Overview  The Section 230 safe harbor was established in 1996, making the providers of \\"interactive computer services\\" immune from liability under civil laws for the actions of their users if they publish objectionable content (such as defamatory and obscene content). Section 230 has been considered a key piece of internet legislation, as operators of online services that handle user- generated content are not liable for civil wrongs committed by their users, if the service was not directly involved in the offending content. These provisions do not apply to criminal or intellectual property law. The Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act made it illegal to advertise sex trafficking, knowingly benefit financially from participation in a venture that advertises sex trafficking, and to engage in activities related to sex trafficking besides advertising, knowingly or in reckless disregard of the fact that sex trafficking is involved. In an op-ed, Portman cited numbers from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which showed an 846% increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking to the organization from 2010 to 2015. He attributed this largely to Backpage, an online classifieds service that had been accused of knowingly accepting ads which facilitated child sex trafficking, and filtered specific keywords in order to obfuscate it. The site had faced legal disputes, and a government investigation spearheaded by Portman. Portman argued that Section 230 was being used to \\"protect its unscrupulous business practices\\", and that Section 230 protections \\"were never intended to apply ‚Äì and they should not apply ‚Äì to companies that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking.\\" Attempts to stop Backpage and similar sites via the court system failed, as the Courts affirmed these sites has protection via Section 230, and those seeking action failed to enjoin the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the matter. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act amends Section 1591 of Title 18 of the United States Code to add a definition of \\"participation in a venture\\", as knowingly assisting, facilitating, or supporting sex trafficking. It amends section 230 of Title 47 of the United States Code to state that it is policy to \\"ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal and civil law relating to sex trafficking\\", and that section 230 does not impair enforcement of \\"any State criminal prosecution or civil enforcement action targeting conduct that violates a Federal criminal law prohibiting [sex trafficking]\\", nor \\"impair the enforcement or limit the application of section 1595 of title 18, United States Code.\\"  Reaction   Support  = Congress = SESTA was co- sponsored by 27 Democratic and Republican senators; early supporters of the bill included members of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is chaired by Portman and led the aforementioned investigation into Backpage. Representative Mimi Walters stated that websites such as Backpage have become the \\"storefronts\\" for the modern-day slave trade and that the FOSTA-SESTA legislation will help prosecutors \\"crack down on websites that promote sex trafficking\\" as well as provide recourse for victims. Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) stated her support for the FOSTA-SESTA package, believing that \\"Congress must act to clarify that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was never meant to shield sex traffickers.\\" = Advocacy groups = The New Jersey Coalition Against Human Trafficking called the FOSTA-SESTA package a \\"groundbreaking bill\\" in the effort to bring justice to victims. The FOSTA- SESTA package is also supported by other members of advocacy groups such as ECPAT Executive Director Carol Smolenski, Operation Texas Shield founder John Clark, and Faith & Freedom Coalition Executive Director Timothy Head. = Corporations = 21st Century Fox and Oracle Corporation have pledged support for the bill; Oracle vice president Kenneth Glueck stated that it would \\"establish some measure of accountability for those that cynically sell advertising but are unprepared to help curtail sex trafficking\\". Fox stated that \\"everyone that does business in this medium has a civic responsibility to help stem illicit and illegal activity. While it is impossible to formulate laws to govern every possible situation, [the] legislation is a rational and measured effort to deal with a tragic and pernicious problem that is global in scope.\\"  Criticism  = U.S. Department of Justice = Writing on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice, Assistant-Attorney General Stephen Boyd addressed Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, expressing concerns that provisions of the bill would make it even harder to prosecute sex traffickers. Additionally they expressed concerns that certain provisions would violate the Constitution's ex post facto clause and thus be unconstitutional. = Congress = Opposition to the bill was voiced by members of Congress as well. In an official statement Senator Ron Wyden stated, \\"I continue to be deeply troubled that this bill‚Äôs approach will make it harder to catch dangerous criminals, that it will favor big tech companies at the expense of startups and that it will stifle innovation.\\" The only other Senator to oppose the bill was Rand Paul. = Advocacy groups = SESTA has been criticized by pro-free speech and pro-Internet groups including the Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, the ACLU, Engine Advocacy, the Sex Workers Outreach Project (which described SESTA as a \\"disguised internet censorship bill\\"), and the Wikimedia Foundation, who argue that the bill weakens the section 230 safe harbors, and places an unnecessary burden on internet companies and intermediaries that handle user-generated content or communications. EFF staff attorney Aaron Mackey told the Washington Examiner that under SESTA, service providers would be required to proactively take action against sex trafficking activities, and would need a \\"team of lawyers\\" to evaluate all possible scenarios under state and federal law (which may be financially unfeasible for smaller companies). Online sex workers argued that SESTA would harm their safety, as the platforms they utilize for offering and discussing sexual services (as an alternative to street prostitution) had begun to reduce their services or shut down entirely due to the threat of liability under SESTA. Others have demonstrated how the platforms that still facilitate sex work have increased their prices and engaged in more exploitative practices, leaving sex workers with limited bargaining power. Social media hashtag campaigns emerged to advocate against the bill for these reasons, such as #LetUsSurvive and #SurvivorsAgainstSESTA. In its original form, the bill defined \\"participation in a venture\\" as \\"knowing conduct by an individual or entity, by any means\\". The EFF and the Internet Association argued that any online service could theoretically be used to \\"facilitate\\" sex trafficking, and that the law would have a chilling effect on voluntary moderation of websites (as encouraged by the \\"Good Samaritan provision\\" of section 230, which states that providers are not liable on account of \\"any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be [objectionable]\\"), as even the mere discovery of sex trafficking content could constitute knowing conduct of participation in a venture, and that dismissing the risk could constitute reckless disregard. The Senate voted down a proposed amendment by Ron Wyden, which would have clarified the law to ensure that moderation does not contribute to liability. The Consumer Technology Association stated that SESTA was well-intentioned but could \\"create a trial lawyer bonanza of overly-broad civil lawsuits\\". The EFF further argued that websites which knowingly facilitate sex trafficking were already liable per Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, which ruled that section 230 immunity does not apply if an online service was directly involved in the creation of content that violates civil law. Exposure of websites to liability under state trafficking laws was also considered a contradiction of 230, as it was designed to help protect service providers from varying state civil laws. In late March 2018 and early April 2018, following the bill's passage but prior to its implementation, courts in Massachusetts and Florida made rulings affirming that Backpage was liable for facilitating sex trafficking, because its practice of intentionally removing keywords pertaining to minors made it a provider of content subject to liability, as opposed to an interactive computer service. The Internet Association stated that it would \\"support targeted amendments to the Communications Decency Act that would allow victims of sex trafficking crimes to seek justice against perpetrators\\", but initially criticized SESTA for using terms which were undefined or broadly-interpreted in case law, and argued that it would \\"introduce new legal risk not just for internet services that do not knowingly and intentionally facilitate illegal conduct, but also create risk for an incredibly broad number of innocent businesses by expanding the notion of contributory liability.\\" The Internet Association pledged support for SESTA on November 3, 2017 after an agreement to clarify portions of it; in particular, the definition of \\"participation in a venture\\" was amended to replace \\"knowing conduct by an individual or entity, by any means, that assists, supports, or facilitates a violation\\" with just \\"knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation\\". It has been suggested that SESTA could be used as a model for future exclusions from Section 230 immunity, such as copyright infringement (especially with its support from major film studios), and terrorism content. = Corporations = Initially The Internet Association (which represents Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other tech companies) voiced opposition to the bill. However, after coming to a compromise on the wording of one section, they withdrew their opposition. The proposed bill originally defined participation as ‚Äúknowing conduct, by an individual or entity, by any means, that assists, supports or facilitates a violation of sex trafficking laws\\" and was amended to ‚Äúknowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation.‚Äù  FOSTA-SESTA package  On February 21, 2018, representative Ann Wagner (R-MO) issued a press release stating that the bill she sponsored, H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), would be put on the House floor the week of February 26, 2018. According to Wagner, the bill was expected to be considered with an amendment from representative Mimi Walters (R-CA) that included victim-centered provisions from SESTA. Like SESTA, the FOSTA-SESTA package would clarify that section 230 of the CDA does not prevent states and victims of sex trafficking from pursuing a course of action against interactive computer service providers, such as Backpage. Wagner said she believed that \\"[o]nline trafficking is flourishing because there are no serious, legal consequences\\" for websites that profit from sex trafficking and that the \\"FOSTA-SESTA package will finally give prosecutors the tools they need to protect their communities and give victims a pathway to justice.\\"  Response  Craigslist ceased offering its \\"Personals\\" section within all US domains in response to the bill's passing, stating \\"Any tool or service can be misused. We can‚Äôt take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services.\\" Furry personals website Pounced.org voluntarily shut down, citing increased liability under the bill, and the difficulty of monitoring all the listings on the site for a small organization. The effectiveness of the bill has come into question as it has purportedly endangered sex workers and has been ineffective in catching and stopping sex traffickers. Opponents have claimed the law doesn't directly address issues that contribute to sex trafficking, but instead has drastically limited the tools available for law enforcement to seek surviving victims of sex trade. The sex worker community has also been severely affected by the law, with sex workers losing access to online safety resources, facing financial hardship, and even going missing or dying because of the law. Similar consequences of the law's enactment have been reported internationally. A number of policy changes enacted by the popular social networks Facebook and Tumblr (the latter having been well known for having liberal policies regarding adult content) to restrict the posting of sexual content on their respective platforms have also been cited as examples of proactive censorship in the wake of the law, and a wider pattern of increased targeted censorship towards LGBT communities.  Legal challenge  On the 28th of June 2018, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a Federal lawsuit challenging the law (Woodhull Freedom Foundation, et al. v. U.S.), representing the Internet Archive, Human Rights Watch, the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, Eric Koszyk, and Alex Andrews, seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional and seeking to have an injunction against it being enforced.https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4567280/Woodhull-Freedom- Foundation-v-United-States-Filed.pdf The lawsuit cites Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (where all but Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was invalidated) and the invalidation of the Child Online Protection Act as precedent, arguing that the combined FOSTA/SESTA law is too broad and poorly- worded and constitutionally defective in the same way those acts were. On September 24, 2018, Judge Richard J. Leon dismissed the EFF's constitutional challenge against SESTA for lack of standing.https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2813&context;=historical The EFF appealed the dismissal. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling on the matter of standing in January 2020, agreeing that the plaintiffs had shown a likely chance that FOSTA/SESTA's limitations may have impacted the plaintiff's rights to freedom of speech.

Upon settling in Constantinople, Anemas converted to Christianity and joined the Byzantine army as a member of the imperial bodyguard. When the emperor John I Tzimiskes campaigned against the Kievan Rus in 971, Anemas joined the expedition and went on to fight in a number of engagements during the Siege of Dorostolon.

Biography Dillon O'Brien, Butler's friend and father of Thomas D. O'Brien, gave Butler inspiration and advice in his colonization efforts Thomas Butler was born on March 21, 1837, in Dublin Ireland to a middle-class family. Growing up, he attended St. Paul's Parish in Dublin. He received secondary education through Schools of the Christian Brothers. Upon hearing of John Henry Newman's new school, Catholic University of Ireland, young Butler was the first to sign his name upon the roster. On October 19, 1854, Butler left the University and enrolled in the humanities class at St. Patrick's College, known at the time as Maynooth College. For the first three years of his priesthood, Butler remained in Ireland where he was appointed to a curacy in Wicklow County at St. Nicholas Parish in Dunlavin. In 1867, Butler immigrated to America and was assigned to Leavenworth, Kansas. Bishop John Baptiste Mi√®ge made Butler associate pastor of the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception. While here, Butler started analyzing the life of an average Irish immigrant in America as well as promoting the state of Kansas as a safe-haven for the Irish to start farms and communities. Although stationed in Leavenworth, Butler spent much of his 8 years traveling the state of Kansas, offering Mass, dispensing sacraments, and assessing the progress of Irish immigrants. From 1872 until about 1874, Butler was placed in charge of the parish in Hoge, Kansas.Butler later in life After his time in Leavenworth, Butler was assigned pastor of St. James Parish in St. Louis. While there, he interacted with many immigrants living in deplorable conditions and not fully finding root in their new home. In 1877, remembering the fertile lands back in Kansas, Butler won the support of wealthy Irish men to fund efforts to create a colony in Northeast Kansas. Soon, they purchased 12,000 acres of land in Pottawatamie County, Kansas from Union Pacific. On February 1, 1887 Butler organized a final meeting of the Colonization Board; the next day, a group of men headed west on the train to start the community. Eventually 600 people moved to this land and established a central community, Butler City; the center of the community being St. Columbkille's Church. At the same time Butler was organizing the Irish Colony, he founded St. Cronan parish in St. Louis. In April 1890, Butler made a visit to the former Butler City (the name of the town had since been changed to Blaine). He was met with a grand celebration with nearly all the surrounding residents attending. On September 6, 1897, while still pastor of St. Cronan's, Butler died. At Butler's Requiem Mass two days later, P. B. Cahill of Macon, Missouri gave a moving sermon: Writings Butler became well known for his writings and poetry, a trait that earned him the nickname \\"The Poet Priest of the West\\". He published two major works in his life, both concerning themselves with Irish immigration. The State of Kansas and Irish Immigration In 1871, Butler published The State of Kansas and Irish Immigration. In this pamphlet, Butler describes his experience in Kansas as a pastor at the Catholic cathedral in Leavenworth. Butler provides advice to people in Ireland who are thinking of immigrating to the United States. The Irish on the Prairies: and Other Poems While still at the Cathedral Of Leavenworth, Butler also published a book of his own poems and songs titled The Irish on the Prairies: and Other Poems. The works included were about the \\"Old Land\\", Immigration, and life on the prairies of Kansas.

Wasow (25 July 1909 ‚Äì 11 September 1993) was an American mathematician known for his work in asymptotic expansions and their applications in differential equations. Early life Wasow was born as Wolfgang Richard Thal in Vevey, Switzerland, to Jewish parents, Alma Thal and Max Richard Kleineibst, who had met in Paris. Alma Thal was from Jelgava in Latvia, a part of Czarist Russia at the time. Her family had sent her to Switzerland to put an end to her political activities. Richard Kleineibst was also a political activist and later gained prominence as a leftwing social democrat in the Weimar Republic. He became a founding member of Socialist Workers' Party of Germany in 1931 and was the first editor in chief of Sozialistische Arbeiter-Zeitung, its main organ. Alma Thal moved to Germany in 1910 and then several more times within Germany. And so Wolfgang grew up first in Munich, and then in Freiburg, Heidelberg and Berlin. When Alma Thal married the Munich photographer Eduard Wasow, Wolfgang took his name. In 1921, Wolfgang Wasow was sent to a boarding school in the Magdeburg district of Prussia. He passed the Abitur exam and graduated from the school in 1928. After studies at Humboldt and Sorbonne, he enrolled at G√∂ttingen and passed the Staatsexamen (a government licensing examination for future teachers) in mathematics, physics and geology in 1933. Emigration Wasow left Germany in 1933 and spent time in Paris and Cambridge before taking a job as a teacher at boarding schools for children of (predominantly Jewish) German emigrants in Italy, first in Florence (1935‚Äì37) and then in Lana in Alto Adige (1937‚Äì38). After the closure of the latter school in 1938 due to the passage of the Italian Racial Laws, Wasow emigrated to England and then to the United States in 1939. Academic career Wasow taught at Goddard College (1939‚Äì1941) and Connecticut College (1941‚Äì42) and was at the same time a PhD student in mathematics under the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs at New York University. He received his PhD in 1942 and stayed to work as an instructor for mathematics until 1946. He then held academic and research positions at Swarthmore, UCLA and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison 1946‚Äì1957, interrupted by a Fulbright Fellowship in Rome (1954‚Äì55). He was appointed full professor of mathematics in 1957 at Madison and Rudolf E. Langer Professor of Mathematics in 1973. He was department chair 1970‚Äì72. He retired in 1980. Wolfgang Wasow's main research area was singular perturbation theory. A classical application is the thin boundary layer that forms on a solid surface as a fluid flows over it. Above the boundary layer, the fluid behaves approximately like a perfect fluid. But within the boundary layer, the velocity of the flow changes rapidly from the high velocity above the boundary layer to a velocity of 0 at the solid surface. Many technical problems can be modeled this way, including the flow of a liquid through a pipe and the flow of air over an airplane wing. Boundary layer problems are instances of a more general class of problems that today is part of the field of singular perturbations. Starting with his 1941 PhD thesis, Wasow was one of the main contributors to developing a mathematical theory of the boundary layer problem and singular perturbations. The organizers of a symposium in his honor at the Mathematics Research Center at Madison write: Wasow was \\"a substantial contributor to the study of singular perturbations for over twenty years\\". His textbook \\"Asymptotic expansions for ordinary differential equations\\" was the first \\"authoritative treatment\\" OMalley, p. 365 of the subject. The Wolfgang Wasow Memorial Lecture, an annual lecture at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, was established in Wasow's honor by his children in 1993.

It was published on September 25, 2018, and is Green's debut novel. Announced on September 19, 2017, the novel is the first of a two-book deal. Plot summary Protagonist April May discovers a large robot sculpture in Midtown Manhattan. She and her friend Andy Skampt decide to film it and post the video online, which goes viral and makes April an overnight celebrity. All over the world identical structures‚Äîknown as \\"Carls\\"‚Äîhave appeared in major cities at exactly the same time. It turns out that there are 64 Carls distributed in cities across the globe, which have miraculously appeared at once. As well, gradually almost all of humanity find themselves entering an interactive Dream when they sleep, within an identical landscape filled with puzzles that provide clues when solved. Over the course of a few months April and her friends work to solve the codes and riddles of the Carls through the Dream. Several governments restrict access to Carls, leading April to become more politically active, which leads to April being interviewed on one news show alongside the conservative pundit Peter Petrawicki, who has written an already bestselling 20-page book called Invaded arguing that the Carls, representing a foreign invader, could be dangerous. For the following months, April cultivates a friendly persona, and writes her own book, saying that people should use the social internet in a positive way to work together at solving the sequences, some of which require specific knowledge and collaboration. April then tries to solve the final clue, a unique sequence only she has access to, which would complete the vector image. After she discloses to the public that the 767 sequence exists, Robin tells her that the Defenders have solved it. Miranda gives April the apparent solution: a nearby address and the words, \\"Only April. No One Else.\\" In her haste to beat the Defenders to the solution, April rushes to the address against Maya's advice, where she finds a large empty warehouse. She live-streams herself on Facebook, expecting to communicate with Carl. The warehouse is a trap, however, the product of tampered hex numbers. April is locked in the warehouse, which becomes engulfed in flames. Facebook commentators realize that the lyrics to a song playing in the warehouse‚ÄîDavid Bowie's \\"Golden Years\\"‚Äîhave been changed to say, \\"In every town around the world each of us must be touched with gold\\". In an epiphany, April tells her hundred-million-strong worldwide audience to touch a sample of gold to each of the Carls simultaneously. The police tell April to break a window and jump out, but after she does so, a burning wooden beam falls on, crushes, and presumably kills April. April, suddenly transported into the Dream, talks to Carl and learns that Carl indeed arrived to observe humanity. In addition, Carl specifically picked April to make First Contact. In the real world, New York Carl launches into the air, and every Carl in the world simultaneously vanishes. In the next few weeks, the world reacts to April's death, and The Defenders are completely discredited for their actions. Eventually, the world returns to normal. Months later, Andy hears a knock at his door and receives a text from April saying, \\"Knock Knock\\". Publication history Green had been working on An Absolutely Remarkable Thing since approximately 2013; he had initially planned it to be a graphic novel, but later decided to turn it into a novel. He wrote about 40,000 words of the novel during NaNoWriMo in 2015. While writing, he drew inspiration from Dune and Michael Connelly's series starring the character Harry Bosch. Green describes the book as a work of speculative fiction. Green revealed the working title of the novel was April May and New York Carl.

The spring is along Warm Spring Creek and there are about six waterfall-fed pools. Goldbug is listed as having a temperature of , but the temperature of the pools will vary depending on the time of year. The pools have a sand/gravel bottom and are dammed by boulders. Due to the hike and remoteness of the trailhead, it is not usually crowded. Water from Goldbug Hot Springs flows into Warm Springs Creek, which flows into the Salmon River. Recreation The trailhead for Goldbug Hot Springs can be accessed from a well maintained dirt road off US 93 near mile marker 282. The first of the trail is on private land that is part of a Bureau of Land Management easement. Hikers will experience in elevation gain along the hike. The trail is maintained with sturdy bridges, and there are sections where hikers will be climbing steps. The last of the hike is the steepest, and the trail continues beyond the hot spring itself. Camping is prohibited at the trailhead, on the easement and within of the hot spring itself. Along the trail, however, there are numerous primitive campgrounds. There is also a campground above the highest pool along Warm Spring Creek. Overnight campers will enjoy almost zero light pollution. The hot spring is free and open year- round. It is not unusual to find visitors skinny dipping. Weather While the hot spring is open year-round, heavy snow in the winter may cause difficulties in accessing it. Temperatures in the pools will be rather chilly in the winter. Summertime temperatures can get extremely hot, and it is suggested that hikers bring extra water and sunblock with them.

She is a former national organizer for the Transgender Law Center, the former executive editor of Out magazine, and currently serves as the Director of Communications for the Ms. Foundation for Women. In 2020, Willis won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Magazine Article. Early life and education Willis was born and raised in Augusta, Georgia. She grew up in a Catholic family that encouraged volunteerism, stewardship, and giving back to the community. Her parents were both Sunday school teachers, and she attended church every weekend. As a child, Willis \\"was very conflicted\\" over her gender and sexuality. She was bullied at school and by kids in the neighborhood. As a teenager, she came out as gay, and eventually found acceptance from her peers and parents. Willis attended college at the University of Georgia, where she encountered more harassment for being gender non-conforming. She came to realize that she was a trans woman, and decided to transition. She worked with other students to counter discrimination based on gender identity. Willis graduated in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. Activism and career After graduating from college, Willis moved to Atlanta and began getting involved in activism with fellow transgender and gender non-conforming people of color. She later came to live in Oakland and work as a communications associate, then national organizer, for the Transgender Law Center. Willis was one of the speakers at the 2017 Women's March in Washington, D.C. She later stated that though she was glad to be there, she felt that trans women were an \\"afterthought in the initial planning\\", and she was cut off by organizers when she tried to say this at the demonstration itself. Willis has spoken out strongly on behalf of trans women, criticizing comments by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie that differentiated transgender women from cisgender women, and calling for a boycott of The Breakfast Club radio show after comedian Lil Duval joked about killing trans women during an interview. Willis designed the Black Trans Flag, a variation on the Transgender Pride Flag with a black instead of white stripe across the middle. Willis' writings have appeared in publications including The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, and Autostraddle. She also hosted The BGD Podcast with Raquel Willis. In December 2018, Willis was appointed as executive editor of Out magazine, becoming the first trans woman to take on a leadership position at that publication. Willis, along with Neal Broverman, endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

Park Avenue Plaza was designed by the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and was constructed from 1979 to 1981.Francis Morrone, Architectural Guidebook to New York City (2009), p. 167. The building stands at 574 feet, with 44 floors above ground, making it the 438th tallest building in North America as of 2018, and has over one million square feet of space available. As of 2018, ownership of the building is divided between Fisher Brothers and Chinese real estate magnate Zhang Xin's SOHO China. Architecture The building shares a zoning lot with the Racquet and Tennis Club, and although that building technically sits between the Plaza and Park Avenue, under the city's zoning rules, the Plaza is on Park Avenue.Jerold S. Kayden, Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience (2000), p. 156. Architecturally, the building has been described as \\"[a] bulky glass prism\\". Unlike neighboring buildings that feature a large open plaza, Park Avenue Plaza \\"eschews the open plaza in favor of a large indoor public atrium space\\", featuring \\"a subtle waterfall\\" and restaurant space. Thus, it has been noted, Park Avenue Plaza is actually \\"not located on Park Avenue\\" and also \\"has no plaza\\". The atrium was \\"mandated by the zoning concessions obtained\\" to permit the construction of the building, and is described as \\"an elegant, two-story glass-enclosed space\\". Usage and tenants In 2011, Chinese real estate magnate Zhang Xin acquired a $600 million stake in Park Avenue Plaza. As of 2015, Zhang Xin's SOHO China owned a 49% stake in the building, with the balance being owned by Fisher Brothers. The atrium is \\"heavily used by an unusually wide spectrum of New Yorkers\\". The building also contains a retail shopping arcade that is \\"not legally part of the public space\\" which the building is required to maintain, but which is still open to the public. The largest tenants in the building have included investment management corporation BlackRock, consulting firm McKinsey & Company, and insurance firm Swiss Re. In 2018, two of the largest tenants moved out of the building, but another large tenant, investment bank Evercore, entered into an agreement to renew and expand its lease. In March, 2018, Fisher Brothers hosted design competition in the atrium, where entrants proposed fanciful new uses for underutilized spaces along Park Avenue.

Pratt ivories, Metropolitan Museum of Art The Pratt Ivories, also known as the Acemh√∂y√ºk Ivories, are a collection of furniture attachments produced in Anatolia in the early second millennium B.C. They were donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art between 1932 and 1937 by Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt. The group represents one of the most important assemblages of furniture fittings from the ancient Near East. In particular, a preserved set of four sphinxes, three lion legs, a falcon, and two recumbent gazelles, comprise the earliest and most complete evidence for a luxury chair or throne from the ancient world. Many of the other pieces in the group likely belonged to a number of small decorative objects.  Acquisition and interpretation  None of the items gifted in these donations were scientifically excavated. Rather, they were purchased on the art market for the Pratt's extensive personal art collection. Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt subsequently donated the ivory pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a series of four donations occurring between 1932 and 1937. The fittings were also accompanied by numerous clay sealings, terracotta objects, plates, and figurines. 400x400px Two of the ivory sphinxes and a plaque featuring a seated lion were given in the first donation in 1932. At the time, the sphinxes were interpreted as \\"little ivory stool legs\\" having been made by a Phoenician or Syrian craftsman for the Assyrian market. This assessment was largely based on their resemblance to pieces uncovered in excavations of the Assyrian capital, Nimrud. This comparison suggests a date of manufacture in the early first millennium B.C. From 1936 to 1937, following the death of her husband, Mrs. Pratt gave numerous other ivory pieces in three successive groups, eventually contributing sixty-six ivory objects, in addition to the three works donated in 1932. While these were immediately recognized as furniture attachments and fittings, scholars continued to debate the origin and date of their production. By 1936, M.S. Dimand, a curator in the Museum, challenged the initial assessment of the works, dating them to the end of the second millennium, around the 13th or 12th century B.C., and assigning their production to an \\"unknown Aramaean art center in Northern Syria.\\"  Acemh√∂y√ºk  Approximately three decades later, excavations at Acemh√∂y√ºk in Turkey provided a conclusive answer to the question of the ivories' date and origin. Led by Nimet √ñzg√º√ß, digging at the site began in 1962, revealing two monumental buildings dating to the early second millennium B.C. One of these structures, in the south-eastern region of the mound, was termed the Sarikaya palace. It had originally consisted of around fifty rooms before ultimately being destroyed by a large fire. Excavations of its rooms revealed numerous clay bullae, which had been baked by the conflagration. These sealings could be connected to known historical figures, which helped provide a date for the palace in the late 19th and 18th centuries B.C. In 1965, excavations revealed other important finds. In room NA-OA/46, located in the western area of the palace, a small group of luxury items were uncovered. This group included several ivory objects. One of these was a wing, which matched those seen on the Pratt falcon. It would come to be understood that one of the wings presented on the falcon was in fact a replica produced by the museum, and that the Acemh√∂y√ºk wing in fact belonged to the piece. Other items found were stylistically comparable to the Pratt ivories, including an ivory lion and panels bearing rosette and guilloche designs. Clay bullae matching those in the Pratt collection were also uncovered. Furthermore, later investigations by Machteld Mellink uncovered a photograph from an antiquities dealer in Antakya, which showed of two of the Pratt sphinxes. Reportedly these came from Aksaray, a town near Acemh√∂y√ºk where items looted from the site were often brought to be sold. All of this evidence effectively demonstrated that the assemblage originated at this site, having been removed illicitly for sale on the antiquities market. The date and origin of the pieces are now understood to be 19th-18th century B.C. and of Anatolian production.  Simpson's Ivory Chair Reconstruction  Reconstruction of the ivory chair from Acemh√∂y√ºk, Turkey, front view. Drawing by Elizabeth Simpson  Form  Although the Pratt ivories cannot be fully understood due to the loss of their archaeological context, Elizabeth Simpson, through in depth analysis of the sphinxes and lion legs determined that the pieces were originally part of what had been a low throne or chair. Her reconstruction of the work, based on close investigation of the ivories' construction, reveals a chair with legs formed from the sphinxes and lion legs. The sphinxes are the lowest element, touching the floor and supporting the weight of the chair. The lion legs rest on top these, facing forward. The front two sphinxes also face forward, while those forming the back legs face outwards to the sides. The rest of the chair, including the frame, seat, backs, and stretchers, would have been made from fine wood. Reconstruction of the ivory chair from Acemh√∂y√ºk, Turkey, side view. Drawing by Elizabeth Simpson It is likely that the falcon and gazelle panels, among others, decorated the back of the chair, in accordance with examples seen in Egypt from the 18th Dynasty. Other Pratt panels with rosettes and guilloche motifs may have originally been incorporated into the design of the chair, but unfortunately it is impossible to determine their exact arrangement. Sumptuous textile cushions on the seat would have completed the luxurious effect.  Color  Examination of the ivory pieces also revealed traces of gilding and inlay, indicating that the chair was further embellished with gold, silver, and precious or semi-precious stones. Based on this trace evidence, the sphinxes appear to have had dark, inlaid eyes and were decorated with applied gold and (perhaps) silver leaf. The platforms beneath the lion paws also appear to have been gilded. Traces of silver on the falcon suggest that it too was once covered. It is possible that even more extensive areas than those suggested by the remaining traces were once gilded, but that the fire reached temperatures high enough to burn off much the metal. 330x330px The color of the sphinxes and lion legs are also frequently commented upon in scholarship of the ivories. Variations in color occur among the pieces (gray, pink, orange, and red), resulting in pieces that match in form but not in color. These disparities are the result of varying conditions (i.e. the level of oxygen) in the fire that destroyed the palace. The ivories were covered with an iron-oxide rich clay slip, which reacted to these particular conditions, resulting in the color changes. Why the ivories were covered in this slip is another question. It is possible that the clay was applied to act as a bole, to assist in the application and burnishing of gold leaf. Simpson notes, however, that the slip occurs on the undersides and backs of the pieces, which would not have been gilded. Red ivory is also a decorative form attested to in texts of the period, which scholars have interpreted as meaning that ivory was often stained a reddish color. Perhaps in this case, the slip performed two functions, as a bole for applied gilding, and as a colorant for the exposed areas of ivory.

Early life Burden was born February 21, 1838 in Troy, New York, the second son of Helen (n√©e McOuat) (1802‚Äì1860) and Henry Burden (1791‚Äì1871), the founder of Burden Iron Works. His siblings included Peter Abercrombie Burden (1822‚Äì1866), Margaret Elizabeth Burden (1824‚Äì1915), Helen Burden (1826‚Äì1891), Henry James Burden (1828‚Äì1846), William Fletcher Burden (1830‚Äì1867), James Abercrombie Burden (1833‚Äì1906), and Jessie Burden (1840‚Äì1917). Burden received a public school education and completed studies at Russell's Academy, a private academy in New Haven, Connecticut. Career Following his studies, at age 19, he began working for his father's company, Burden Iron Works. His father was known as the \\"Ironmaster of Troy.\\" The company was reorganized in 1881, ten years after his father's death, and he became an almost 50% owner, with his brother James A. Burden, until his death in 1913. After his brother James's death in 1906, his nephew, James A. Burden II, became more heavily involved in the company. He also served as president of Port Huron Iron Company and was one of the organizers of the Knickerbocker Trust Co. of New York, of which he held a large ownership interest. He was also a trustee of the Lake Champlain and Moriah Railroad Company, and president of Bailey's Beach in Newport. Society life Newport, 1852. Burden and his wife were members of the infamous \\"Four Hundred\\" of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892. His wife was credited with introducing Harry Lehr to high society at their home in Newport. He was also a member of the Union Club, the Newport Casino, and was President of the Spouting Rock Beach Association of Newport. He purchased former Vice President of the United States and New York Governor Levi P. Morton's residence, designed by Seth C. Bradford and built in 1852-1853. The home was known as \\"Fairlawn\\" and was located on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1870, Morton had Richard Morris Hunt, designer of Ochre Court, add a ballroom to the house for a visit by Ulysses S. Grant shortly after he became President. In 1881, McKim, Mead and White designed family rooms on the second floor over the ballroom and added Tiffany stained glass windows to the Great Hall. When Burden bought the home from Morton in 1900, he commissioned Peabody and Stearns to add a curved porch. After his death, the home was passed to his children. Personal life On April 18, 1871, he was married to Evelyn Byrd Moale (1847‚Äì1916), the daughter of William Armistead Moale (1800‚Äì1880) of Baltimore, Maryland, who was a direct descendant of the Carter and Byrd families of Virginia. Her sister, Judith Carter Moale was married to Robert Livingston Cutting Jr., a prominent banker. Together, they were the parents of four children: * Evelyn Byrd Burden (1874‚Äì1968), who did not marry. * Isaiah Townsend Burden, Jr. (1875‚Äì1953), who married Florence Sheedy (1888‚Äì1949) of Denver in June 1911. * William Armistead Moale Burden (1877‚Äì1909), who married Florence Vanderbilt Twombly (1881‚Äì1969), daughter of Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly and Hamilton McKown Twombly, in 1904. * Gwendolyn Townsend Burden (1884‚Äì1935), who married David Dows (1885‚Äì1966) in December 1911. Burden died on April 23, 1913. Following his death, he was buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York. Descendants Through his son William, he was the grandfather of William Armistead Moale Burden, Jr. (1906‚Äì1984), a banker who served as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium from 1959 to 1961, and Shirley Carter Burden (1908‚Äì1989), a prominent photographer.

This intronless gene encodes a member of the DNAJ molecular chaperone homology domain-containing protein family. This gene is deleted in Williams syndrome, a multisystem developmental disorder caused by the deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11.23.  Structure  The DNAJC30 gene is an intronless gene composed of only one exon, with the chromosome location 7q11.23 in humans. Its open reading frame (ORF) consists of 681 bp in the human cDNA and 660 bp in the mouse cDNA, which encode proteins of 226 and 219 residues, respectively. They are members of the DNAJ molecular chaperone homology domain-containing protein family.  Function  DNAJC30 is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, stomach, and testis, though no transcripts were found in colon, small intestine, and muscle. This protein has been found to localize to the cytosol and mitochondria of cells. Though its exact biological function has yet to be elucidated, the centromeric location of DNAJC30 on the chromosome has led Merla et al. to postulate that it may contribute to functions such as subtle defects in cognition, transient hypercalcemia, and gastrointestinal problems experienced by Williams Beuren syndrome patients. A recent study found that DNAJC30 functionally links to the mitochondrial ATP synthase and influences brain development which proves the involvement in Williams Beuren syndrome.  Clinical Significance  This gene is one of several contiguous genes located at 7q11.23 deleted in Williams Beuren syndrome, the others including: elastin, FKBP6, FZD9 (FZD3), BAZ1B (WSTF, WBSCR9), BCL7B, TBL2 (WS-Œ≤TRP), WBSCR14 (WS- bHLH), STX1A, CLDN3 (CPETR2, RVP1), CLDN4 (CPETR1), LIMK1, EIF4H (WBSCR1), WBSCR15 (WBSCR5), RFC2, CYLN2 (CLIP-115, WBSCR4, WBSCR3), GTF2IRD1 (WBSCR11, GTF3), and GTF2I (BAP135, SPIN). Williams Beuren syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by congenital heart and vascular disease, hypertension, infantile hypercalcemia, dental abnormalities, dysmorphic facial features, mental retardation, premature aging of the skin, and unique cognitive and personality profiles. While haploinsufficiency of elastin is known to cause the cardiovascular deficiencies, the roles of the other 16 genes in the deleted region, including DNAJC30, have yet to be confirmed.

For example, in a diploid species, if there are two SNP loci and the first locus has alleles A and G, while the second locus has alleles T and C, the multilocus genotype can be represented as {A/G,T/C}. If the genome is not haploid then the multilocus genotype does not necessarily determine which alleles co-occur on chromosomes. In the example, if the two loci are located on the same chromosome the possibilities are either {A-T,G-C} or {A-C,G-T}. Where A-T represents a haplotype with alleles A and T together on one chromosome and G and C together on the other. If the haplotypes are determined the multilocus genotype is referred to as a phased genotype, otherwise it is referred to as unphased. Some authors suggest that the term multilocus genotype should only be applied to phased multilocus data while others apply it to unphased multilocus data as well. The combination of alleles at two or more loci on a single chromosome make up a haplotype and the two haplotypes in a diploid individual make up the diplotype (a synonym for a phased multilocus genotype).

His younger brother was the theoretical physicist Siegfried Fl√ºgge (1912‚Äì1997). After completing the gymnasium in Dresden in 1921, he obtained his Dipl.-Ing. in civil engineering in 1925 at the Technische Hochschule Dresden, now Dresden University of Technology. After his graduation Fl√ºgge started his academic career at the Technische Hochschule Dresden as assistant to Kurt Beyer, an specialist on calculations on reinforced concrete. Fl√ºgge obtaining his Doctor of Engineering under Beyer in 1927. Next from 1927 to 1930 he worked in the construction company Dyckerhoff & Widmann in Wiesbaden and Leipzig, involved \\"in the development of new ideas of thin-shell construction in reinforced concrete for factories, train stations and observatories.\\" In 1930 Fl√ºgge obtained an post-doctoral position at the University of G√∂ttingen, where in 1932 he submitted his habilitation thesis. In 1932 he was appointed privatdozent at the University of G√∂ttingen, but he came difficulties after being labelled \\"politically unreliable\\" according to the Nazi policies. In 1938 he married Irmgard Lotz, a researcher at the Aerodynamics Research Institute, and the both continued their research and development at the German Aerospace Center (DVL) in Berlin during World War II, until the beginning of 1944.  Further career and acknowledgement  With the ongoing destruction of Berlin the research facilities were moved in the spring of 1944 to Bad Saulgau in southern Germany, after the war in the French zone of occupation. In 1947 Fl√ºgge and his wife Irmgard Fl√ºgge-Lotz accepted positions at the new created Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches A√©rospatiales (ONERA) in Paris. With assistance of Stephen Timoshenko Fl√ºgge and his wife were both offered position at Stanford University in 1949. Fl√ºgge became appointed Professor of Applied Mechanics, and served at Stanford University until his retirement. In 1970 Fl√ºgge received both the Theodore von Karman Medal in Engineering Mechanics, and the Worcester Reed Warner Medal from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

It operates as a tourist attraction. The mill is located on the site of the northern terminus of the defunct Mawddwy Railway.  History   Slate warehouse  The large, slate-built building that Meirion Mill now occupies was originally built in 1867 to serve as a warehouse for the nearby Minllyn slate quarry. Slate products from the quarry were stored in the warehouse, waiting to be shipped by trains on the Mawddwy Railway to Cemmaes Road and beyond. During the First World War, the warehouse was converted into a sawmill for local timber production, and remained in use for timber into the 1920s.  Woollen Mill  After a period of disuse, the building was taken over in 1946 by a consortium of local farmers who converted it into a woollen mill. Their principal product was sheep's wool, and by joining together they could produce high-value woven products from the fleeces. They incorporated as The Wool Society Ltd. in 1947. This enterprise was initially successful, but by 1952 it was taken over by the Welsh Agricultural Organisation Society. They continued to run it, but by the early 1960s the business was failing, and the Society sought an operator for the mill. The Turner Brothers of Bridlington, a manufacturer of bedspreads, took over as the operator of the mill in 1963. They upgraded the machinery and sought to purchase the business outright, but the Society declined to sell it. Turner Brothers then abandoned their use of the mill. In 1966, Cheshire industrialist Raymond Street took over.  Meirion Mill  Street invested both time and money into the mill, further modernising its equipment, and expanding the business. He founded the Welsh Weavers Association and in 1973 ran the first Welsh Fair at Llandrindod Wells. He adopted the name Meirion Mill for his business. Street saw an opportunity to expand the operation at Dinas Mawddwy beyond weaving. He opened the Mill as a tourist attraction and sales venue. By 1974 the Mill was attracting 100,000 visitors annually. Looking to expand the attraction further, Street planned to open a railway museum on the station site. This plan rapidly expanded to include a narrow-gauge railway, which opened in 1975 as the Meirion Mill Railway. This only operated until Easter of 1977. Street also rented space to local craft workers who could sell their products at the Mill and demonstrate their crafts as additional tourist attractions, these included weaving and pottery. During the 1980s, sales of woven products became the primary business at the Mill, with the local crafts gradually being phased out, and active weaving stopping.. Today the tourist shop sells a range of woven items, crafts and homeware. In addition to the shop, the old Mawddwy Railway building now also contains a caf√©. At the site many relics of the old railway still remain.

Analogous NDAAs have been passed in previous and subsequent years. Background The Trump Administration released its fiscal year 2018 budget request on 23 May 2017, requesting $677.1 billion for the federal government's national defense-related activities. $667.6 billion of that amount was for discretionary funding to be provided by an annual appropriations bill. For fiscal year 2018, the cap set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 on discretionary defense spending was $549 billion. The Trump Administration budget request exceeded this cap by $46 billion. Legislative history House vote H.R. 2810, the version of the NDAA 2018 which was reported by the House Armed Services Committee, was passed by the House of Representatives on 14 July 2017 in a 344‚Äì81 vote. Senate vote The Senate Armed Services Committee reported its version of the NDAA 2018 bill, S. 1519, on 10 July. The text of S. 1519 was substituted for the House-passed text of H.R. 2810, and Senate passed an amended version of H.R. 2810 on 18 September in an 89‚Äì8 vote. Presidential signature President Donald Trump signed the NDAA 2018 on 12 December 2017. left left  Sections of the Act   Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2017  Florida congressmen Carlos Curbelo (R) and Patrick Murphy (D) proposed the Foreign Spill Protection bill in 2015 to change the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) to ensure the costs of foreign oil spills in American waters are incurred by the responsible party. The bill was passed with no opposition in the House in April 2016 but did not pass in the Senate. Curbelo brought back the bill in 2017 with Florida U.S. Representative Darren Soto (D) as the chief cosponsor. The Foreign Spill Protection Act was subsequently passed as a section of the NDAA bill for fiscal year 2018.  Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Preservation Act of 2017  The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) removes American and Russian ground-launched intermediate-range missiles. The NDAA 2018 includes a $25 million fund for developing a new road-mobile ground-launched cruise missile which would be prohibited by the INF Treaty. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Preservation Act of 2017 included within the NDAA 2018 explicitly calls for the establishment of an American missile program that violates the terms of the INF Treaty. Pentagon spokesman Thomas Crosson stated, \\"We are prepared to stop such research and development if Russia returns to verifiable compliance with the Treaty.\\"  Saving Federal Dollars Through Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act of 2017  The NDAA included a bill for the Saving Federal Dollars Through Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act, which was proposed by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Carper (D-Delaware), and Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the spending on travel and purchase cards by federal agencies.  Modernizing Government Technology Act  The 2018 NDAA included the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT Act), which would fund IT modernization projects in the federal government with $250 million each in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. The money is to be held by GSA in a category called the Technology Modernization Fund. The MGT act requires agency CIOs to evaluate applications from within their agencies, and if funding is received to report on the projects every six months. The MGT had evolved from proposals by Reps. Will Hurd and Steny Hoyer who had combined efforts in September 2016.

It is one of the most common macroinvertebrates in salt marshes in these states. It prefers areas of lower salinity than other fiddler crabs, and can be found in great numbers along the banks of tidal streams, even at distances greater than from the sea.  Description  Like other fiddler crabs, Uca minax males have one claw that is significantly larger than the other, while females have two equal-sized smaller claws. The joints on the claws are red, a noticeable feature that is the origin of the common name \\"red‚Äêjointed fiddler crab\\".  Reproduction  Uca minax breed for two weeks in the summer in a small round burrow dug by the male. The larvae are unable to survive in the lower-salinity brackish water preferred by adults, and the adults do not travel to the sea to release the larvae. As such, the larvae use ebb tides to travel to higher-salinity environments to develop before returning as adults.

The Steel Woods are an American country music group from Nashville, Tennessee exploring a variety of genres - stringing together lyrically strong songs, a big sound and well-put together harmonies, they have created a new sound that is being dubbed \\"Smart Southern Rock.\\" A quartet of Southern rock traditionalists from Nashville, The Steel Woods lay claim to the sound pioneered by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Like Skynyrd, The Steel Woods balance heavy blues-rock with Southern poetry, and they add a bit of plainspoken outlaw country to the mix, as evidenced on their 2017 debut, Straw in the Wind. Though their style is unapologetically Southern Rock and Rock, just pull back the layers to find lyrics that feature passionate storytelling and messages that resonate. At first glance, Nashville four-piece The Steel Woods may seem like a chip off the ol' Skynyrd block. But you're just as likely to hear hints of Ricky Skaggs in the outfits' rollicking bluegrass rock as Southern rock heroes like Skynyrd or The Allman Brothers Band. Lead singer Wes Bayliss' Southern fried vocal certainly fits among the long list of long-haired rebel rockers, but there's a certain subtlety to The Steel Woods you just don't hear in modern Southern rock. Much of that comes from the band's affinity for old country tunes. \\"I grew up on Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Led Zeppelin,\\" says co-founder and guitarist Jason \\"Rowdy\\" Cope. The themes reflected in their music range from perseverance and unity to hope and resilience. Inspired by conversations they had with people they met on the road, The Steel Woods strive to find common ground through shared life experiences and a musical connection. Over the last few years, the band has built a loyal and passionate fan base through their road warrior touring mentality and extraordinary live shows. Whether headlining or supporting artists such as Dwight Yoakam, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jamey Johnson, Cody Jinks, Miranda Lambert and Blackberry Smoke, among others, The Steel Woods consistently convert audiences with each performance. The band sounds like \\"drinking a bottle of bourbon and having inebriated hallucinations of Gregg Allman and Lucinda Williams standing hand in hand in powder-blue choir robes, as ‚ÄòMelissa‚Äô plays in the background,\\" the staff of Rolling Stone wrote in a May 2017 \\"10 New Country Artists to Know\\" list. With a pair of critically acclaimed Woods Music/Thirty Tigers releases under their belts in Straw in the Wind (2017) and Old News (2019), Nashville- based The Steel Woods have lived up to their name as a hybrid musical force both in the studio and live.  History  The Steel Woods were cofounded by Wes Bayliss and Jason \\"Rowdy\\" Cope. Bayliss is a multi-instrumentalist and lead singer with soulful pipes like Chris Stapleton, while lead guitarist Jason \\"Rowdy\\" Cope brings the outlaw spirit, having played in Jamey Johnson‚Äôs band for nine years. The band‚Äôs two original members are native sons of the south who both hale from small-town backgrounds. Cope, 42, and Bayliss, 28, lead Steel Woods together despite the 13-year difference in their ages. Cope‚Äôs experience and Bayliss‚Äô freshness are complementary, Cope said. Frontman Wes Bayliss grew up in Woodland, Alabama, playing music in his family's gospel band. By the age of 12, he was playing harmonica, mandolin and guitar. In 2007, he moved to Mobile, Alabama, where he experimented further, booking gigs on everything from drums and bass to keys. Jason \\"Rowdy\\" Cope picked up a guitar at the age of 11 and wrote his first song shortly thereafter. Now, he brings his highly technical, all-American talent as The Steel Woods‚Äô guitar lead and producer. After eight years working as a Los Angeles-based musician, he moved to Nashville in 2007 and quickly joined up with Jamey Johnson‚Äôs band. In his nine years with Johnson, Cope co-wrote \\"Can‚Äôt Cash My Checks,\\" and helped Johnson make the Grammy nominated and critically acclaimed albums \\"That Lonesome Song\\" (2008) and \\"The Guitar Song\\" (2010). The two met in Nashville playing for the same cover band in some out-of-town dive, and immediately discovered an affinity for each other. After first becoming friends, the two eventually wound up collaborating, adding bassist Johnny Stanton and original drummer Jay Tooke to round out the lineup. An eponymous EP came out in 2016, and the next year saw the release of Straw in the Wind on Thirty Tigers/Woods Music. In early 2020, Isaac Senty was named as drummer. Over the course of just over three years as a band, The Steel Woods have toured with fellow Southern rockers like Cody Johnson, Cody Jinks, Whiskey Myers and Blackberry Smoke as well as inspirations such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Miranda Lambert, performing in Europe for the first time last year. In between another hectic year of concert dates, The Steel Woods are also preparing to release their third studio album for Woods Music/Thirty Tigers. \\"We‚Äôre going to tour these two records and do everything in our power to do them justice and get our music out to our fans,\\" says Wes. Rolling Stone said The Steel Woods repurposed their cover of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers‚Äô \\"Southern Accent\\" into a \\"roaring... Southern rock power ballad,\\" while Saving Country Music raved, \\"Though there is not a shortage of Southern rock bands, few have the edge and darkness The Steel Woods bring to the table.\\" They recorded their second release, Old News, in Asheville at the site of an old church during a break in their busy touring schedule. The whole band played in a single room, cutting the tracks virtually live. Their album Straw in the Wind was released on May 19, 2017, with a guest vocal appearance by Lindi Ortega. Influences on the album range from Led Zeppelin and Metallica to Darrell Scott and Jason Isbell. It was the band's debut album. Brent Cobb also contributed as a songwriter. While it came out in the United Kingdom on May 18, it came out in the United States on May 19. On June 10, 2017, it was at 42 on the Independent Albums chart put out by Billboard. They released a music video for their track \\"Straw in the Wind\\" in July 2017. They released their second album, Old News, on January 18, 2019.

Matilda served in the West Indies until 1799, capturing six small privateers. In 1799 she sailed to Woolwich where she became a hospital ship. Between 1805 and 1807 she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Henry Stanhope. She was broken up in 1810. Origins Jacobine was originally named Bonheur, but received the name change before she was launched. She was built to a one-off design by Pierre Degay. Jacobine was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Dalbarde from 3 April 1794 until 13 September 1794. She initially was stationed at Nantes. She then sailed from Mindin (opposite Saint-Nazaire), to Brest. From there she made a patrol in the Atlantic, returning to Brest. Her next commander was lieutenant de vaisseau Dandicolle.Fonds Marine (1790-1804), p.98. Capture and captured Jacobine. She was armed with twenty-four 12-pounder guns, and had a crew of 220 men; she was nine days out of Brest and had taken nothing. The capture took place on 31 October 1794, about 30 leagues west of Cape Finisterre. Ganges and Montague were sailing to the West Indies and took Jacobine with them. Career The Royal Navy in July 1795 commissioned Matilda under Commander George Vaughan. (Because she was a sixth rate she would normally be a post captain's command, and Vaughan indeed received the requisite promotion in November.) In fact, Matilda was already in service by July. Vice-Admiral Benjamin Caldwell, the commander-in-chief of the Barbados and Leeward Islands station had stationed her off Basseterre, Guadeloupe. She joined up with him at Saint-Pierre, Martinique, on 29 June with the report that the day before she had seen a French squadron of nine ships, three of them large frigates. They had chased him off, and sailed into the port. She had also qualified to share in the proceeds of the capture of Saint Lucia in 25 May by the naval forces under Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian and troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. In December Captain Captain Robert Otway replaced Vaughan. In May 1796 Captain Henry Mitford replaced Otway. On 13 February 1797 Matilda captured a French navy schooner of two guns and 38 men. The capture took place off Barbados and Captain Mitford sent the schooner into port there. At some point between 25 July and 5 October, Matilda detained the sloop Mary, of 104 tons (bm) and ten men, of Saint Thomas. She was sailing from Saint Thomas to Suriname. She was carrying cash and dry goods, had a crew of Frenchmen, and had false invoices. On 14 January 1798, Mitford and Matilda arrived at English Harbour, Antigua. There Mitford arrested Thomas Pitt, Lieutenant Lord Camelford, of . He had shot and killed Lieutenant Charles Peterson, was in command of . Both vessels were in the harbour undergoing refit when they got into a dispute over who was the senior commander. Camelford accused Paterson of mutiny, and shot him. The two ships' companies came close to firing on each other. The subsequent court martial acquitted Camelford. On 19 January Matilda captured the French privateer ship Ceres off Antigua. Ceres was pierced for 14 guns but only carried two. She had a crew of 45 men, and was sailing from Saint Bartholomew's to Guadeloupe to complete her fitting-out. She was carrying a cargo of pitch and tar. Matilda was still north of Antigua when on 29 and 31 March she captured two privateers. On 29 March she captured the sloop Vautour, of 10 guns and 64 men. Then two days later, Matilda captured the brig Aigle, of 12 guns and 86 men. The waters off Antigua continued to be productive for Matilda. On 29 June she captured Annibale, of 14 guns and 97 men. Then on 23 June Matilda captured Etoile, of six guns 53 men. The arrival of an Admiralty Order dated 27 June 1798 confirmed the commissioning of Matilda, and the name change from Jacobine. Matildas last capture took place on 5 October, again off Antigua. The captured privateer was Intrepid, of 14 guns and 74 men. She was three days out of Guadeloupe and had not yet taken anything. Matilda sailed for England and arrived at Woolwich on 15 October 1799. There she was hulked and became a hospital ship under the command of a succession of lieutenants.

Born in Vermont in 1834, she began contributing poems to the Portland, Maine Transcript in 1846. She wrote prose and poetry for the Carpet-Bag, Ladies' Repository, and the Rose-Bud. For several years, she was a contributor to the publications of Maturin Murray Ballou. Some of her poetry, including \\"The Old Canoe\\", was occasionally attributed to other authors. That and \\"Haunted\\" were printed in Poets and Poetry of Vermont (Boston, 1860). \\"The Old Bridge,\\" \\"Mabel,\\" \\"My Angels,\\" and \\"Watching\\" were also well known. \\"Lily of the Valley\\" was issued in book-form (Boston, 1859). Page died in Massachusetts in 1862.Appletons, p. 624 Early life and education Emily Rebecca Page was born in Bradford Village, Vermont, May 5, 1834. Her father, Casper Page, by occupation a shoemaker, was formerly of Greensboro, Vermont. Her mother, Emily A. (Alger) Page, was daughter, by a former marriage, of Mrs. Eugene Baker, and died when this, her infant daughter and only child, was only two weeks of age. The dying young mother gave her child to Mrs. Baker, her own mother, to raise as her own. Page's father died of tuberculosis before Page was two years old. Eugene Baker, the step- grandfather, was toll-gatherer at Piermont Bridge, across Connecticut River. His toll house, in which Page was brought up, was at the west end of the bridge, and in Bradford, her native place. Her commemoration of the bridge in her poem, \\"The Old Bridge\\", was natural. Early teachers included her aunt, Maria R. Baker, and Miss Mary Belcher. When still young, Page attended a private school in Piermont, New Hampshire. When older, she attended the academy in Bradford and, for a term or two, that at St. Johnsbury, Vermont. The last time she appeared in the schoolroom, was at the close of the academic year. She was so frail that she was obliged to lean upon another student while she read her essay out loud. Page wrote verses while yet a child, and when about twelve years of age, some of her poetic effusions found their way into the local paper, much to her regret in later years. Career Page began contributing poems to the Portland \\"Transcript\\" in 1846. She wrote both prose and poetry for the \\"Carpet-Bag,\\" \\"Ladies' Repository,\\" and an annual called the \\"Rose-Bud\\" (Boston, 1854‚Äì55), as well as for Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber's publication. She was for several years a constant contributor to Ballou's publications and an assistant in the editorial work. Several of Page's poems appeared in the Gazetteer, and also in the volume of Vermont Poets. Abby Maria Hemenway, editor of the Vermont Historical Gazetteer, said that Page had the honor, while living, of being one of the only two in Vermont admitted by Charles Anderson Dana into his compilation of the Household Poets of the World. Her work was included in Lily of the Valley (Boston, 1859). \\"The Old Canoe\\" and some of her other poems were often mistakenly attributed to various distinguished authors. The first and revised edition of Poets and Poetry of Vermont (Boston, 1860), edited by Hemenway contains several of Page's poems, including \\"The Old Canoe\\" and \\"Haunted\\". \\"The Old Bridge,\\" \\"Mabel,\\" \\"My Angels,\\" and \\"Watching\\" were also well known. After the death of the step-grandfather, Page moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, near Boston, with her grandmother Baker and Aunt Maria. Here, she was connected for editorial work with one of the Boston weekly papers, and as poetical editor of Frederick Gleason's various publications. Always frail and delicate, she died at Chelsea, February 14, 1862, age 27. Her grave is in Woodlawn Cemetery, in Everett, Massachusetts, her epitaph being her own words, \\"Through the darkness into light.\\" References Citations Attribution External links * 1834 births 1862 deaths 19th-century American poets 19th-century American women writers People from Bradford, Vermont American women poets Writers from Vermont ","title":"Emily Rebecca Page"},{"id":"55290279","text":"Mark Warren (September 24, 1938 ‚ÄìJanuary 11, 1999) was an American television and film director.
