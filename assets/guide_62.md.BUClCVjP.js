He surveyed music schools to create UCLA's state-of-art music building and Schoenberg Hall. As a composer, Vincent's music is known for its rhythmic vitality and lyricism. Although his music is essentially classical in form it is distinctly individual. The free tonality of his work makes use of what he calls 'paratonality': the predominance of a diatonic element in a polytonal or atonal passage. Vincent wrote numerous orchestral works, chamber music pieces, art songs, and choral works. He also wrote one ballet, 3 Jacks (1942), a film score, Red Cross (1948), and an opera, Primeval Void (1969). In 1951 his book The Diatonic Modes in Modern Music was published. He also conducted orchestras throughout the US, and all South American countries sponsored by U.S.-State Dept, and he was a director of the Rustic Canyon art-colony Huntington Hartford Foundation from 1952 to 1965. He died in Santa Monica, California in 1977. Vincent was founding-director of Walt Disney's California Institute of the Arts. Personal life Vincent married Amelia Bartlett, violinist, in 1927. In 1928 he formed the Aeolian Trio with Amelia and Abbie Durkee. Together they performed recitals in the El Paso area . Amelia and John lived in Paris from 1935‚Äì1936 with their 7-year-old son, Nathaniel. In Paris, Vincent made arrangements to study privately with Boulanger at the Ecole Normale de Musique. Ruth Kimball, a classmate from Harvard, also attended classes in Paris. During this year, Vincent's marriage with Amelia suffered. Amelia and their son returned to the United States to live with Vincent's parents. Amelia and John divorced in 1937.

He died in 2002 from esophageal cancer. Early life Calvo spoke fluent Spanish, German, and English.IM Dr. Ricardo Calvo As a chess historian, Dr. Calvo set out to prove that Spain was central to the monumental changes that occurred in chess late in the fifteenth century. It is most widely believed that the increased powers of the queen and the bishop were introduced during the Renaissance in Italy; however, Calvo insisted that Spain played a major role. Politics Dr. Calvo was deeply involved in chess politics. In 1987, he was condemned by FIDE and declared \\"persona non grata\\" (Latin: \\"An unwelcome person\\") by a vote of 72-1, for writing a controversial article in New in Chess. The article, according to FIDE, was a \\"racial attack on Latin Americans\\".Chess games of Ricardo Calvo In response, Calvo wrote a letter to FIDE titled \\"On the Nature of FIDE Legitimacy\\" in which he disputed their decision: Notable Games Ricardo Calvo vs Viktor Korchnoi This game between Ricardo Calvo and GM Viktor Korchnoi is known as \\"Calvo's Salvo\\",Calvo's Salvo and was played at the Havana Olympiad 1966: 1. e4 c5 2.

In recent years a consensus has emerged that it is likely that the annalist was a woman. The annals are mostly dedicated to the history of the Holy Roman Empire; they also contain the first written mention of the name of Lithuania (\\"Litua\\"), dated to March, 1009. The original document has disappeared, surviving only as a 16th-century copy held in Dresden, but its contents endure as a scholarly resource. Background St. Servatius Church and the monastery The city of Quedlinburg, Germany, was first mentioned in writing in a document dated to 922. Saint Mathilda founded Quedlinburg Abbey, a religious community for women, there in 936, leading it until her death in 966. The abbey became a premier educational institution for the female nobles of Saxony, and maintained its mission for nearly 900 years.Felice Lifshitz. Die Annales Quedlinburgenses Series: Monument Germaniae Historica, Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum In Usum Scholarum Separatim Editi vol. 72, 2004. Retrieved on 2008-09-01 The city served as an imperial palatinate of the Saxon emperors, where Henry the Fowler, the founder of the Ottonian dynasty, was buried.Alfredas Bumblauskas. Senosios Lietuvos istorija 1009-1795. 2005, p. 16 Quedlinburg was situated not far from Magdeburg, the Royal Assembly of the empire, and its annalists could therefore rely on genuine information from the royal house and obtain eyewitness accounts. The city lost some stature under the rule of Henry II, who broke with the tradition of celebrating Easter there; the Annals portray him unfavorably, and demonstrate the extent to which a royal monastery was entitled to criticize its monarch. Annals The Annals open with a chronicle of world history from the time of Adam to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680-681, based on chronicles by Jerome, Isidore, and Bede. The narrative is largely borrowed from multiple older sources until the year 1002, although original reports from as early as 852 are present. Beginning in 993, the narrative begins including events which represent the annalist's own eyewitness testimony concerning events at and around Quedlinburg. The amount of detail increases significantly from 1008 onwards, leading some analysts to conclude that 1008 was the actual date that the Annals were first compiled, although Robert Holzman argues for a start date of 1000. It has been suggested that the annalist temporarily abandoned the project between 1016 and 1021. The exact reasons for this suspension of the work are unknown. Work on the project continued between 1021 and 1030, when its authors were able to report a military victory against Mieszko II. The primary task of the annalists was to record the heritage of the Ottonian dynasty and of Quedlinburg itself. The Annals incorporate the stories of a number of historic and legendary figures such as Attila the Hun, King Dietrich of the Goths, and others. The historian Felice Lifshitz has suggested that the amount of saga material integrated into its narrative is without parallel. The Annals of Quedlinburg became an important research source; during the 12th century they were used by at least five contemporary historians. Felice Lifshitz asserts that the Annals of Quedlinburg played a key role in shaping the ways in which influential Germans of the 19th and 20th centuries saw their medieval past. They continue to be analyzed in other contexts: by scholars of Beowulf discussing its use of the term Hugones to mean Franks, by climatologists, and in a book discussing fear of the millennium. Mention of Lithuania The first written occurrence of Lithuania's name has been traced to the Quedlinburg Annals and dated to 9 March 1009.Richard C. Frucht. Eastern Europe. 2004. p.169 The passage reads: From other sources that describe Bruno of Querfurt, it is clear that this missionary attempted to Christianize the pagan king Netimer and his subjects.Alfredas Bumblauskas. Lietuvos t≈´kstantmetis ‚Äì Millennium Lithuaniae. Retrieved on 2009-09-01 However, Netimer's brother, refusing to accept Christianity, killed Bruno and his followers. The historian Alfredas Bumblauskas has suggested that the story records the first baptismal attempt in the history of Lithuania.

Projects La Belle was one of Robert de La Salle's four ships when he explored the Gulf of Mexico with the ill-fated mission of starting a French colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River in 1685. La Belle was wrecked in present-day Matagorda Bay the following year, dooming La Salle's Texas colony to failure. For over three centuries the wreckage of La Belle lay forgotten until it was discovered by a team of state archaeologists in 1995. The discovery of La Salle's flagship in July 1995 was regarded as one of the most important archaeological finds of the century, and a major excavation was launched by the state of Texas that, over a period of about a year, recovered the entire shipwreck and over a million artifacts. All of the artifacts were removed from the hull by the start of March 1997. From that point on, the archaeologists concentrated on the remains of the ship itself. The entire ship was disassembled, each timber being carefully recorded before and after its removal from the hull remains. Fieldwork was completed by May 1997. The recovered timbers were eventually reassembled in a special cradle and vat designed at Texas A&M; University's Nautical Archaeology Program, the institution in charge of the conservation of all the artifacts recovered from the shipwreck site after 1995. The hull of the ship and many of the recovered artifacts, including a cannon, are now on display at the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in the state capital of Austin.KXAN News, \\"Historic LaBelle shipwreck ready for Bullock Museum\\": http://kxan.com/2014/10/22/historic-labelle-shipwreck-ready-for-bullock- museum/.

The shipwreck, whose real identity remains a mystery, lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). In May 2007, an expedition, led by Texas A&M; University and funded by OGGC under an agreement with the Minerals Management Service (now BOEM), was launched to undertake the deepest scientific archaeological excavation ever attempted at that time to study the site on the seafloor and recover artifacts for eventual public display in the Louisiana State Museum.

Of these, numbers 92 585‚Äì588, 92 606, 92 607, 92 910‚Äì913 were locomotives that originated in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways and 92 732‚Äì738 from the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine. In 1935, locomotives 92 919‚Äì950 were transferred from the Saar Railways to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1943 they were joined by a further five locomotives from the Zschipkau-Finsterwald Railway Company with numbers 92 991‚Äì995. During the Second World War, numbers 92 951‚Äì990 and 996 from Poland and 92 1101‚Äì1112 from Czechoslovakia were added. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany) took over in 1950 locomotives 92 6401 and 92 6501‚Äì6504 from private railways. Numbers 92 6502‚Äì6504 were T 13s that had been procured directly by the Brandenburg St√§dtebahn. The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired the last engine in 1965 at Kassel locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw); the Reichsbahn followed suit in 1968. Four representatives of the D-h2t Class 92.10 remained in Austria after the Second World War. These were numbers 92 1052, 1055, 1063 and 1068. The √ñBB retained their serial numbers but grouped them into √ñBB Class 792. All the engines in this class had been retired by 1962.  T 13.1  In the early 1920s, the newly founded Reichsbahn ordered 13 of the proven T 13 engines in a superheated variant, the T 13.1, for the Oldenburg division (the former Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways) and Altona division. They were goods train, tank locomotives with a 0-8-0T wheel arrangement and were subsequently incorporated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn's renumbering plan as DRG Class 92.4 with operating numbers 92 401‚Äì413. The Saar Railways, too, procured five T 13.1s in 1922 from Krauss in Munich, which were however somewhat different. Amongst other things, they had a differently designed driver's cab and additional equipment on top of the boilers. They were numbered by the Reichsbahn as 92 414‚Äì418. Other former private railway locomotives, that were numbered as 92 421, 92 431‚Äì437 and 92 441 and 442 by the Reichsbahn were not Prussian T 13.1s. The engines remaining in the western zones of occupation after the Second World War were sold by 1948 to private railways.  T 13 Hagans variant  The T 13 Hagans Variant built for the Prussian state railways was also a goods train, tank engine, with an 0-8-0T wheel arrangement, but had Hagans driving gear. The firm of Hagans in Erfurt developed this design with a split locomotive frame in order to achieve better curve running qualities. In the main frame were located the two front driving axles, whilst the rear two, were housed in a swivelling frame and driven via a specially developed arrangement of levers by the front axles. The Hagans T 13 was built as a smaller version of the Prussian T 15 by the firm of Henschel from 1899to 1902. It was delivered to the railway divisions of Erfurt, Saarbr√ºcken, Magdeburg and Frankfurt am Main. Unfortunately its complicated construction proved to be very maintenance- intensive, which had a negative impact on its economy. As a result, the locomotives were retired as early as 1923. Two similar engines had been supplied by Henschel to the Baden state railways as the Class VIII d. The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped five of these locomotives into its 1923 renumbering plan as 92 501‚Äì505, but in 1925 they were no longer in service.  T 13 Mallet variant Within the T 13 class of locomotives were also the five Mallet tank engines that were taken over on 1 January 1913 along with the Bergheimer Kreisbahn and M√∂drath-Liblar-Br√ºhler railway west of the Rhine. This handful of B'B n4vt engines was acquired by the Royal Prussian Railway Division of C√∂ln (Cologne) and they were numbered as C√∂ln 7946‚Äì7950. They were the only Mallet tank locomotives in Prussia. At the same time several locomotives of the Hohenzollern version were delivered to the Filderbahn and Moselbahn. The Cologne engines were retired in 1920/21.

It then works creatively with delivery agencies and others, offering models, tools and approaches to support them in challenging traditional approaches, so as to demonstrate equitable involvement. WISE combats gender stereotypes to get more girls and women involved in careers where female participation was once considered near impossible. WISE operates throughout the UK, with specialist committees in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

He had multiple nicknames including \\"'o rre\\" (the king) and \\"Lovigino\\", which is an amalgamation of Luigi and love. In 2002, he decided to collaborate with Italian law enforcement and became a pentito, a co-operating witness against organised crime. Early life Giuliano was born into the family of Pio Vittorio Giuliano, a well-known smuggler. Pio Vittorio Giuliano had 11 children. Six boys, Luigi \\"o re or the king\\", Guglielmo \\"o stuorto or the crooked one\\", Nunzio Giuliano, Carmine \\"o lione or the lion\\" (1952-2004 E' morto il boss Carmine Giuliano, Corriere della Sera, July 3, 2004), Salvatore \\"o montone or the ram\\", Raffaele \\"o zui\\", Neapolitan slang for being the youngest son. The other four girls, Erminia Giuliano, who was called Celeste, Patrizia, Silvana and Anna. Forcella, morto il re del contrabbando , Il Giornale di Napoli, September 29, 2009 Nunzio dissociated himself from the Camorra and, by extension, his own family in the 1980s, following the drug- related death of his son. In later years, he fought to keep young people away from the Camorra, and was about to publish a book containing numerous interviews and anti-Camorra appeals which were directed towards the people of Campania, before he was killed on March 21, 2005. Ucciso il fratello del boss Giuliano, Corriere della Sera, March 22, 2005 At the age of 14, Giuliano stole a car belonging to an American expatriate together with Giuseppe Misso, the future boss of the Misso clan. His father found a briefcase containing hundreds of US dollars in the car. Pio Vittorio Giuliano was a powerful member of the Giuliano clan, which had traditionally controlled the Forcella, or \\"Casbah\\" area in the centre of Naples. Luigi Giuliano replaced his father as head of the clan in the mid-1970s. War with the NCO The Giuliano clan was on such bad terms with rival mobster Michele Zaza that it launched an attack against his nephew Pasquale in December 1979. The Giuliano clan had been in good terms with the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, headed by Raffaele Cutolo until the first half of 1979, but the two clans then broke out into conflict. Cutolo demanded to receive a cut from the Giulianos' illegal gambling centres and lottery system in his power base of Portici. Following this, the Vollaro clan leader named Luigi Vollaro raised the idea of an anti-Cutolo alliance with Giuliano. A provisional death squad was set up, which contributed to the dozens of gangland deaths that year.Behan, The Camorra, pp. 56 The breaking point was reached when the NCO tried to move into the Giulianos' stronghold of Forcella, Piazza Mercato and Via Duomo, in the centre of Naples. A few days before Christmas 1980, two NCO members presented themselves at an unloading of contraband cigarettes at Santa Lucia and demanded immediate payment of $400,000 to their organization, as well as insisting on future payment of $25 for every crate of cigarettes brought ashore. They then proceeded to shoot and injure one of the Giuliano gang members unloading the cigarettes. On Christmas Eve, Luigi Giuliano himself was wounded in an attack. Nuova Famiglia The clash, which had occurred in a period of growing tension, led to the formation of the Nuova Famiglia (NF) to oppose Cutolo‚Äôs predominant NCO, consisting of Giuliano, Zaza, the Nuvolettas and Antonio Bardellino from Casal Di Principe (the Casalesi clan). After the defeat of Cutolo, the leaders of the NF achieved absolute dominance over all criminal rackets in the city of Naples. Luigi Giuliano relinquished control of the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish Quarters) to the Di Biase brothers, Luigi and Mario who ruled the area under the approval of Giuliano. He later became a founding member of the Secondigliano Alliance, a consortium of Camorra clans formed in Naples towards the end of the 1980s. Arrest Luigi Giuliano held the reins of his clan undisturbed for nearly thirty years. However, he was arrested in early 2000 and was succeeded by his sister, Erminia, who was ranked as one of Italy's 30 most dangerous criminals, and eventually arrested after being a fugitive for over 10 months.'Mob queen' found in cupboard, BBC News, December 24, 2000 She became the boss because the only direct male heir to the family business still unimprisoned, Giuliano's nephew Pio Vittorio Giuliano, was deemed inept. In January 2001, his wife Carmela Marzano was arrested and charged with threatening the widow of Giuseppe Ginosa, a rival Camorrista. She wanted to testify against Giuliano's son-in-law and two associates accused of murdering her husband in 1999. Their daughter, Marianna, was also arrested.Where Hit Men Better Mean It When They 'Yes, Ma'am' the Boss, New York Times, January 11, 2001 Pentito In September 2002, Giuliano decided to collaborate with the Italian authorities and became a government witness. He cited his willingness to change his life as a reason for his collaboration with the authorities. The former boss revealed many secrets and revealed details which opened several branches of investigation, some of which are still ongoing. The information divulged featured corrupt police officers, corrupt judges, rigged auction houses, and complacent courts. He even made several statements against his former ally, Giuseppe Misso, and revealed specific details regarding the murder of the Vatican's banker Roberto Calvi, who was found hanging from scaffolding beneath Blackfriars Bridge in the financial district of London in 1982. Luigi Giuliano's collaboration with the Italian authorities was preceded by that of his two brothers, Guglielmo and Raffaele.

He was known for his blunt suggestions, which eventually led to his removal as chancellor.  Background  It is not known when Zhang Gao was born, but it is known that his family was from Bo Prefecture (ÂçöÂ∑û, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). His great- grandfather Zhang Shanjian (ÂºµÂñÑË¶ã), grandfather Zhang Wuding (ÂºµÊ≠¶ÂÆö), and father Zhang Zhigu (ÂºµÁü•Âè§) all served as prefectural-level officials.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Zhang Gao himself was said to be handsome and ambitious, and he often conversed about the affairs of the military and statecraft. He was also said to have studied the Confucian classics, but was also devoted to fishing and hunting. In his youth, he studied under the Tang Dynasty scholar and official Wu Jing (Âê≥ÂÖ¢), and Wu respected him. Later, when Zhang Gao travelled to the Tang capital Chang'an, he lived in a solitary room and did not associate much with others. However, he liked to drink and played the Guqin. If honored men at court invited him to feasts, he would go for the sole purpose of getting drunk.Old Book of Tang, vol. 111.New Book of Tang, vol. 139. Toward the end of Tianbao era (742-756) of Emperor Xuanzong, the chancellor Yang Guozhong wanted to retain talented men on his staff. He summoned Zhang and, after meeting him, recommended Zhang to be Zuo Shiyi (Â∑¶ÊãæÈÅ∫), a low-level official at the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). After the general An Lushan rebelled in 755 and established his own state of Yan, Yang often consulted Zhang on military matters, and it was at the recommendation of Zhang and another consultant, Xiao Xin (Ëï≠Êòï), that Yang made another official, Lai Tian (‰æÜÁë±), a general, and Lai enjoyed some successes against Yan forces. In summer 756, Yan forces approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee toward Chengdu. Zhang followed Emperor Xuanzong on foot to Chengdu.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu but fled to Lingwu instead, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong of Tang). When the news reached Emperor Xuanzong, he recognized Emperor Suzong as emperor and took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor). He sent a number of officials, including Zhang Gao, to attend to Emperor Suzong, and in 757, Zhang reached Emperor Suzong's makeshift court at Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). As Emperor Suzong was impressed by Zhang's suggestions, he made Zhang Jianyi Daifu (Ë´´Ë≠∞Â§ßÂ§´), a consultant at the examination bureau. He soon further promoted Zhang to be Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. At that time, Emperor Suzong retained several hundred Buddhist monks to recite sutras day and night, hoping to draw divine favor, and their voices carried within and without the makeshift palace. Zhang, wanting to end the practice, spoke to Emperor Suzong:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 219. Emperor Suzong was said to agree with his words, but historical accounts did not indicate whether the practice stopped. Meanwhile, as Emperor Suzong believed Zhang to be capable in both civilian and military matters, he soon made Zhang the military governor (jiedushi) of Henan Circuit (Ê≤≥Âçó, roughly modern Henan and Shandong) and commander of the forces in the region, replacing Helan Jinming (Ë≥ÄËò≠ÈÄ≤Êòé). Zhang knew that, at that time, the general Zhang Xun and the city that he was defending, Suiyang, were under heavy siege, and he therefore tried to march his troops at twice the speed to try to save Suiyang. He also ordered the generals in the region to report to Suiyang to try to save it, but by the time that he arrived in the locale, Suiyang had already fallen, and Zhang Xun was killed by the Yan general Yin Ziqi (Â∞πÂ≠êÂ•á). In anger, Zhang Gao summoned one of the generals who had disobeyed his order and who had refused to try to save Suiyang, Luqiu Xiao (Èñ≠‰∏òÊõâ) and executed Luqiu by caning. Subsequently, after a joint Tang and Huige force recaptured the Tang eastern capital Luoyang (the force had recaptured Chang'an earlier), Zhang and five military governors under his command, Lu Jiong (È≠ØÁÇÖ), Lai Tian, Li Zhi (ÊùéÁ•á) the Prince of Wu, Li Siye, and Li Huan (ÊùéÂ•ê), recaptured the commanderies throughout the Henan and Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, i.e., modern Shanxi) region, except for two commanderies where the Yan generals Neng Yuanhao (ËÉΩÂÖÉÁöì) and Gao Xiuyan (È´òÁßÄÂ∑ñ) held out. He was created the Duke of Nanyang. Meanwhile, Tang forces were putting An Lushan's son and successor An Qingxu under siege at Yecheng, and with the siege proceeding and the last major remaining Yan general, Shi Siming, submitting his post of Fanyang (ËåÉÈôΩ, in modern Beijing) to Tang, it appeared that the realm would be soon peaceful. However, Zhang distrusted Shi, believing that Shi was merely buying time and would soon rebel himself; he thus advised Emperor Suzong to use extreme caution with regard to Shi. He also distrusted another Tang general, Xu Shuji (Ë®±ÂèîÂÜÄ) and suggested that Emperor Suzong recall Xu to the capital. However, Emperor Suzong trusted the reports of eunuchs he sent to meet with Shi and Xu, which stated that both Shi and Xu were trustworthy. In spring 758, Emperor Suzong thus removed Zhang from his posts as chancellor and military governor, instead sending him to Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei) to serve as its defender. (Zhang's warnings proved to be prescient, however, as Shi soon rebelled, and after Shi's forces had some preliminary victories over Xu, Xu surrendered to him.) Zhang was soon recalled to serve on the staff of Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Yu and Zuo Sanqi Changshi (Â∑¶Êï£È®éÂ∏∏‰æç), a high-level advisor at the examination bureau. In 761, however, after a plot to make Emperor Suzong's cousin Li Zhen (ÊùéÁèç) the Prince of Qi emperor was discovered, as Zhang had previously purchased a mansion from Li Zhen, he was considered Li Zhen's associate. Emperor Suzong thus exiled him to Chen Prefecture (Ëæ∞Â∑û, roughly modern Huaihua, Hunan) to serve as the census officer.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died in 762, and Li Yu succeeded him (as Emperor Daizong). Emperor Daizong pardoned many officials who had been punished during Emperor Suzong's reign, and he made Zhang Gao the prefect of Fu Prefecture (Êí´Â∑û, roughly modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). He soon made Zhang the prefect of Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, roughly modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) as well as the commander of the forces in the seven prefectures around Hong Prefecture. He also created Zhang the Duke of Pingyuan. Subsequently, when forces under the agrarian rebel Yuan Chao (Ë¢ÅÊôÅ) were disturbing the region, Zhang led his own forces at Shangrao (‰∏äÈ•í, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) and defeated Yuan's forces, killing several thousand. He also killed two other significant agrarian rebels, Yang Zhao (Ê•äÊò≠) and Shen Qianzai (Ê≤àÂçÉËºâ). Zhang was thereafter made the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Jiangnan West Circuit (Ê±üÂçóË•øÈÅì, roughly modern Jiangxi). He died in 764. It was said that, despite Zhang's meteoric rise‚Äîbecoming chancellor within three years of being a civilian‚Äîhe was respected for his honesty and humility, as well as his willingness to open himself to his subordinates and good insight. Therefore, despite his lack of seniority, he was respected as any other senior official.

Among his siblings was Barbara Field, who also married three times (to Anthony Addison Bliss, Robert Kenneth Boggs, and George Peter Joseph Benziger, grandson of James Joseph Brown). Through his father's second marriage to Ruth Pruyn (the first wife of Ogden Phipps), he was the elder half-brother to Fiona Field, who married Jean Eugene Paul Kay. His maternal grandfather was merchant Charles Henry Marshall Jr. (who served as Commissioner of Docks and Ferries of the City of New York) and his paternal grandfather was Marshall Field Jr., the son of Marshall Field, the founder of Marshall Field and Company, the Chicago-based department stores. His parents divorced and his mother remarried to Diego Suarez. His maternal uncle, Charles Henry Marshall III, was married to Brooke (n√©e Russell) Kuser, the daughter of John H. Russell Jr. (16th Commandant of the Marine Corps). After his uncle's death, Brooke remarried to Vincent Astor in 1953. He was educated at Harvard University, and the University of Virginia School of Law. Career Field was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy in June 1942. He served as a gunnery officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in a number of engagements in the Pacific and was wounded during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. His conduct in the engagement won him the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, and the Presidential Unit Citation. He was discharged with the rank of Lt. Commander in 1944. He learned the newspaper trade as a reporter for the Chicago Sun, owned by his father, from 1946 to 1948. He had a nervous breakdown and was briefly institutionalized following his father's death in 1956, then took up the reins as the owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and Field Enterprises. He also owned Parade magazine from 1956 to 1958 and purchased the Chicago Daily News in 1959. Personal life In 1938, Field was married to Joanne Bass (1915‚Äì2000), daughter of former New Hampshire Governor Robert P. Bass, in East Walpole, Massachusetts. Joanne was a graduate of the Ethel Walker School. The couple divorced in 1947 after having two children together: * Marshall Field V (b. 1941), who married Joan Best in 1964, and became the father of Marshall Field VI. * Joanne Field Langdon. His second marriage, which lasted from 1950 to 1963, was to Katherine Woodruff (later Fanning). She was a journalist who edited and published the Anchorage Daily News. They married in Joliet, Illinois, and before their divorce, they were the parents of three children:\\"Anchorage Daily News on the death of Kay Fanning\\" Peninsula Clarion (October 21, 2000).

His third marriage, to Julia Lynne Templeton, who previously worked in public relations, was in 1964, and ended with his death the following year. The couple had one child: * Corinne Field (b. 1965). Marshall Field IV died on September 18, 1965. While it was rumored that he had died of an accidental overdose, the Cook County coroner's office ruled his death as result of natural causes. His estate was valued at $25,500,000.

Photometric stereo is a technique in computer vision for estimating the surface normals of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions. It is based on the fact that the amount of light reflected by a surface is dependent on the orientation of the surface in relation to the light source and the observer. By measuring the amount of light reflected into a camera, the space of possible surface orientations is limited. Given enough light sources from different angles, the surface orientation may be constrained to a single orientation or even overconstrained. The technique was originally introduced by Woodham in 1980.Woodham, R.J. 1980. Photometric method for determining surface orientation from multiple images. Optical Engineerings 19, I, 139-144. The special case where the data is a single image is known as shape from shading, and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn in 1989.B. K. P. Horn, 1989. Obtaining shape from shading information. In B. K. P. Horn and M. J. Brooks, eds., Shape from Shading, pages 121‚Äì171. MIT Press. Photometric stereo has since been generalized to many other situations, including extended light sources and non-Lambertian surface finishes. Current research aims to make the method work in the presence of projected shadows, highlights, and non-uniform lighting. Basic Method Under Woodham's original assumptions ‚Äî Lambertian reflectance, known point-like distant light sources, and uniform albedo ‚Äî the problem can be solved by inverting the linear equation I = L cdot n, where I is a (known) vector of m observed intensities, n is the (unknown) surface normal, and L is a (known) 3 times m matrix of normalized light directions. This model can easily be extended to surfaces with non-uniform albedo, while keeping the problem linear.S. Barsky and Maria Petrou, 2003. The 4-source photometric stereo technique for 3-dimensional surfaces in the presence of highlights and shadows. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 25, issue 10, pages 1239-1252. IEEE. Taking an albedo reflectivity of k, the formula for the reflected light intensity becomes: :I = k (L cdot n) If L is square (there are exactly 3 lights) and non-singular, it can be inverted, giving: :L^{-1} I = k n Since the normal vector is known to have length 1, k must be the length of the vector k n, and n is the normalised direction of that vector. If L is not square (there are more than 3 lights), a generalisation of the inverse can be obtained using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, by simply multiplying both sides with L^T giving: :L^T I = L^T k (L cdot n) :(L^T L)^{-1} L^T I = k n After which the normal vector and albedo can be solved as described above. Non-Lambertian surfaces The classical photometric stereo problem concerns itself only with Lambertian surfaces, with perfectly diffuse reflection. This is unrealistic for many types of materials, especially metals, glass and smooth plastics, and will lead to aberrations in the resulting normal vectors. Many methods have been developed to lift this assumption. In this section, a few of these are listed. Specular reflections Historically, in computer graphics, the commonly used model to render surfaces started with Lambertian surfaces and progressed first to include simple specular reflections. Computer vision followed a similar course with photometric stereo. Specular reflections were among the first deviations from the Lambertian model. These are a few adaptations that have been developed. * Many techniques ultimately rely on modelling the reflectance function of the surface, that is, how much light is reflected in each direction.Hemant D. Tagare and Rui J.P. de Figueiredo, 1991. A Theory of Photometric Stereo for a Class of Diffuse Non-Lambertian Surfaces. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 13, no. 2. IEEE. This reflectance function has to be invertible. The reflected light intensities towards the camera is measured, and the inverse reflectance function is fit onto the measured intensities, resulting in a unique solution for the normal vector. General BRDFs and beyond According to the Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, a surface may distribute the amount of light it receives in any outward direction. This is the most general known model for opaque surfaces. Some techniques have been developed to model (almost) general BRDFs. In practice, all of these require many light sources to obtain reliable data. These are methods in which surfaces with general BRDFs can be measured. * Determine the explicit BRDF prior to scanning.Katsushi Ikeuchi, 1981. Determining Surface Orientations of Specular Surfaces by Using the Photometric Stereo Method. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. PAMI-3, issue 6, pages 661-669. IEEE. To do this, a different surface is required that has the same or a very similar BRDF, of which the actual geometry (or at least the normal vectors for many points on the surface) is already known.Aaron Hertzmann and Steven M. Seitz, 2005. Example-Based Photometric Stereo: Shape Reconstruction with General, Verying BRDFs. In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 27, no. 8. IEEE. The lights are then individually shone upon the known surface, and the amount of reflection into the camera is measured. Using this information, a look-up table can be created that maps reflected intensities for each light source to a list of possible normal vectors. This puts constraints on the possible normal vectors the surface may have, and reduces the photometric stereo problem to an interpolation between measurements. Typical known surfaces to calibrate the look-up table with are spheres for their wide variety of surface orientations. * Restricting the BRDF to be symmetrical.Michael Holroyd, Jason Lawrence, Greg Humphreys and Todd Zickler, 2008. A Photometric Approach for Estimating Normals and Tangents. In ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2008 Papers, pages 133:1-133:9. ACM. If the BRDF is symmetrical, the direction of the light can be restricted to a cone about the direction to the camera. Which cone this is depends on the BRDF itself, the normal vector of the surface, and the measured intensity. Given enough measured intensities and the resulting light directions, these cones can be approximated and therefore the normal vectors of the surface. Some progress has been made towards modelling an even more general surfaces, such as Spatially Varying Bidirectional Distribution Functions (SVBRDF), Bidirectional surface scattering reflectance distribution functions (BSSRDF), and accounting for interreflections.Shree K. Nayar, Katsushi Ikeuchi and Takeo Kanade, 1991. Shape from interreflections.

Interreflection Removal for Photometric Stereo by Using Spectrum-dependent Albedo. In 2011 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 689-696. IEEE. However, such methods are still fairly restrictive in photometric stereo. Better results have been achieved with structured light.Tongbo Chen, Hendrik Lensch, Christian Fuchs and H.P. Seidel, 2007.

She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Pacific Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line. Because of the closeness of the sound of names issued for radar picket ships at the time, Interrupter had her name changed by the Navy to Tracer so as not to confuse her with and Construction Tracer (AGR-15) was laid down on 24 December 1944, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 2340, as the Liberty Ship Dudley H. Thomas, by J.A. Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched 31 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Marion Harders; and delivered 21 February 1945, to the Moore McCormack Lines, Inc. Service history Merchant service William J. Riddle operated with Moore-McCormack Lines and the Waterman Steamship Corporation from 1945 to 1947. When hostilities ended in the Far East in mid- August 1945, she was steaming from Hawaii to the Philippines. Converted to a cattle carrier the following year, she operated as such through the end of 1946. Changed back to a dry cargo carrier by March 1947, she voyaged to European and Mediterranean ports until the summer of 1947, when she was laid up in MARCOM's James River Reserve Fleet, Lee Hall, Virginia. She remained there for 10 years. US Navy service The Navy selected William J. Riddle for conversion to a radar picket ship in May 1957. Towed to the Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina, conversion work began on 24 May 1957. Renamed Interrupter, and classified as AGR-15, she was commissioned at Charleston, 16 October 1958, Lieutenant Commander George Seymour Harrison, USN, in command. Following shakedown in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and post- shakedown availability at her conversion yard, Interrupter sailed for the Pacific Ocean. She transited the Panama Canal, on 26 January 1959, and arrived at her home port, San Francisco, California, on 12 February, the sixth AGR to join newly formed Radar Picket Squadron 1. Fitted out with the latest radar detection equipment, Interrupter and her seven sister ships were designed to serve as the seaborne eyes of the North American Air Defense Command (CONAD), the naval link in the chain of early-warning stations covering the Pacific approaches to the United States. Her mission was to \\"detect, report, and track enemy airborne threats approaching by overseas routes and to control the intercepts used to destroy such threats.\\" Before putting to sea for her first patrol, she conducted training evolutions with U.S. Air Force officers embarked on board for familiarization with the ship's mission. In addition, Interrupter's, officers and men familiarized themselves with the Air Force's part in this vital mission. On 6 March 1959, Interrupter sailed from San Francisco on her first barrier patrol. On 4 September 1959, Interrupter was renamed Tracer to eliminate confusion with some of her sister ships with similarly sounding names. Between 1959 and 1965, Tracer conducted patrols at sea, at various picket stations in the Western Contiguous Radar Line. The ship proved to be an efficient vessel and received awards for administrative and operational efficiency on several occasions. As more sophisticated early- warning systems came into operational use, the need for the AGRs diminished accordingly. Decommissioning Deactivated in 1965, Tracers name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1965. She was then transferred to the US Maritime Commission (MARCOM) and laid up at the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, California, where she remained until sold, 15 July 1974. Before being scrapped in China in 2000, Tracer, renamed Unisea, served as a fish processing plant in Unalaska, Alaska.

(1502‚Äì1571) was a Franciscan missionary in New Spain, and the first Bishop of Yucat√°n. (in Latin) Biography De Toral was ordained a priest in the Order of Friars Minor. On November 19, 1561, Francisco de Toral was appointed by Pope Pius IV the first bishop of the Diocese of Yucat√°n and consecrated bishop on May 24, 1562 by Sancho D√≠az de Trujillo, Auxiliary Bishop of Plasencia, with Fernando de Villag√≥mez, Bishop of Tlaxcala, and Juan de Vaca, Bishop of Panam√°, serving as co-consecrators. Portrait of Francisco de Toral As part of his effort to Christianize the Indians of New Spain, Toral learned to speak the Nahuatl and Popoloca languages, and compiled a dictionary and grammar of the latter. He also charged Bernardino de Sahag√∫n with the creation of the Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva Espa√±a. In Yucat√°n he led an investigation into the alleged abuses of the Maya by Diego de Landa, employing Gaspar Antonio Chi as his interpreter; Landa would eventually be acquitted, and follow Toral as Bishop of Yucat√°n. He claimed that crosses were being burned, and human sacrifices were made in church. In the end, Mayans were considered innocent, based on the lack of proof. Francisco de Toral requested his permission be terminated, but his request was denied. Following this denial, he moved to Mexico City and lived there until his death on April 20, 1571.  Experiences in Yucat√°n  Before Toral arrived in the Yucat√°n, Landa arrived in 1549 and ordered the destruction of more than 20,000 Mayan artifacts that were determined to be cult images over his time in the region. In addition to his overseeing of these artifacts‚Äô destruction, he actively tortured Mayans in order to produce confessions of idolatry. Mayans that confessed to idol worship faced severe penalties, ranging from flogging to ten years of forced labor for minor offenses. Toral arrived in 1562 to a province that was in a great state of unrest. There was a large controversy among Mayans and secular government officials with regards to Landa‚Äôs treatment of allegedly idolatrous Indians. Toral was shocked by the violent behavior of the Franciscan friars. He believed that the clergy had both a right and duty to physically punish Mayans resisting conversion, but Toral was skeptical that the confessions Landa elicited were legitimate and the resulting punishments were an overreaction to the situation. In Toral‚Äôs eyes, Landa was doing work outside of the position he had been designated. With this conflict began a period of distrust between Toral and the Franciscans of the Yucat√°n. In response to these events, Toral forced Landa‚Äôs return to Spain in 1563 in order to answer the accusations that were being drawn against him. As Toral began to exercise his authority, he freed hundreds of Mayans that Landa had imprisoned. Under his supervision only the most extreme cases of idolatry were investigated, and even those resulted in fairly light sentences. In addition to this, Toral began to cooperate more with local secular authorities in order for his religious order to be as effective as possible. He removed Franciscan missionary clergy from the administration of ecclesiastical justice, urging his secular clergy to use verbal persuasion to draw Mayans away from idolatry. Toral‚Äôs distrust of Franciscans and his inability to control the friars still holding authority resulted in a large amount of tension between himself, the Franciscan order, and local government authorities, namely Governor Luis de C√©spedes y Oviedo. Charges were brought against him by Governor C√©spedes for usurping royal jurisdiction as animosity towards him as a religious leader began to grow. Landa was eventually absolved of his charges in 1569. Following this and his ongoing dilemmas in Yucat√°n, Toral requested he be relocated to serve in Mexico City before ultimately abdicating his position in 1570 and dying in Mexico.

A social-climber from a minor branch of the Brienne family, Erard actually held no lands in Brienne and had little just cause to appropriate the name \\"of Brienne\\" for himself. His uncle Erard II of Brienne had indeed ruled as count of Brienne. Andre, the brother of Erard II, was the father of Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt. The younger Erard was actually lord of Ramerupt, which wasn't very impressive compared to the holdings of the more senior branches of the Brienne family. Within his own letters, the younger Erard thus tried to enhance his prestige by consistently referring to himself as \\"Erard of Brienne\\" and not even mentioning Ramerupt. The name \\"Erard of Brienne- Ramerupt\\" is retroactively applied by historians for the sake of clarity. Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt's uncle, the aforementioned Count Erard II of Brienne, was the father of the famous crusader knight John of Brienne (1170-1237), who in 1210 wed the heiress Maria of Jerusalem to become the nominal King of Jerusalem by marriage (albeit, the crusaders had lost control of the city of Jerusalem itself by this point). Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt, perhaps seeking to emulate the success of his cousin, who found great prestige traveling to the east and marrying a powerful heiress, therefore in June 1213 left Champagne for the Latin East with the stated intention of marrying Philippa of Champagne, the younger half-sister of Maria of Jerusalem. The War of Succession of Champagne The line of succession of the counts of Champagne had become complicated in the current generation. Before he left France to fight in the Third Crusade in 1190, Henry II had his barons swear that should he never return, his younger brother Theobald III was his designated heir. Henry II never returned from the Latin East, but instead married Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem and fathered two daughters, Alice and Philippa. Henry II died in 1197. Technically, Henry II's young daughters were his rightful heirs. However, their family made no attempt to press their claim, and Theobald III succeeded him. Theobald died of a sudden illness in May 1201, leaving behind his heavily pregnant wife, Blanche of Navarre, who secured the succession for a posthumous son, Theobald IV. Having successfully married Philippa, Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt returned to Champagne with his new bride in January 1216. Armed clashes soon broke out, and the War of Succession of Champagne began. King Philip II imposed a truce in April 1216 to put a stop to the fighting, and held a court at Melun in July 1216 to hear Erard and Philippa's case. Unfortunately for Erard, the court ruled that because Theobald III had already done homage for Champagne to the king for several years, yet Philippa and her family never challenged his succession in all that time, Henry II's daughters could no longer make a claim for the inheritance. Blanche again presented the signed agreements of Henry II's barons which swore that Theobald III was to be his heir if he never returned from the crusade. Unsatisfied, Erard returned to open rebellion in spring 1217. Erard gathered to himself a large number of barons from the fringes of Champagne or from old and powerful aristocratic families, who were not pleased with the increasing efforts of Theobald III and Blanche to bring them all under centralized control. Most of Erard and Philippa's supports came from the fringes of Champagne, along the southern and eastern borders, away from the core territories of \\"Champagne and Brie\\" in the west. One of Erard's major supporters was Simon of Joinville, hereditary seneschal of Champagne and leader of one of the most powerful noble families in the county. Further, Erard allied with Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine, significantly bolstering the rebel faction. By 1218, however, the tide had turned, as Blanche secured papal excommunications against the rebel lords, and gained the support of the neighboring duke of Burgundy and count of Bar. Further, Blanche allied with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II to counterbalance Duke Theobald I of Lorraine. By May 1218 Blanche and her army rode with Frederick II's forces to Lorraine's capital of Nancy and burned it to the ground. By June 1218, the rebellion had largely collapsed and individual lords began to make their own separate peaces. Erard and Philippa established a truce agreement in July 1218, which ultimately lasted the rest of Blanche's regency until 1222, during which time other rebel lords continued to haggle for better peace terms. Blanche offered peace on generous terms to Erard and Philippa, wanting to end the challenge to her son's rule as quickly as possible. Erard received a surprisingly large payment of 4,000 livres, with a lifetime rent of 1,200 livres. Only after the war ended, when hope of becoming count of Champagne was lost, did Erard stop the charade of presenting himself as \\"Erard of Brienne\\". Instead, after 1222, he would specify in his letters that he was \\"Erard of Brienne, lord of Ramerupt\\". Later life Despite losing the war, on the whole Erard did quite well for himself. He had started out as a grasper from a minor branch of the Brienne family, clinging to a name he didn't technically have the right to use because it enhanced his social prestige. The massive payoff that Blanche gave Erard in the peace agreement that ended the war, however, propelled him to a place alongside the highest level of regional barons. Erard used his newfound wealth to buy up lands surrounding his own, so that he was able to cobble together his own larger barony. By 1227, he even bought up the other half- share of Ramerupt - he had only owned a half-share of his own castle up to this point - uniting it under his sole possession. Erard did not intervene against Theobald IV during the difficult invasion of other northern barons of France in 1229, because anticipating that Erard might try to challenge him again, Theobald IV bought him off with a 200 livre fief, and in return had to swear to surrender his castles of Ramerupt and Venizy until the invasion was over. Erard died at roughly the age of sixty in 1243. All that he had striven to achieve for himself and his children, however, evaporated within only a few years. Both of his sons died on the Seventh Crusade in 1250, and his wife Philippa died that same year. Erard had six daughters, one of whom had predeceased him without issue and another who became a nun. Ramerupt was subsequently divided into quarters between the remaining four daughters, whose husbands absorbed the lands into their own separate lordships. Marriage and issue Erad married Philippa of Champagne, they had the following children: * Erard (d. 1250), married Mathilde by whom he had one daughter. * Henri (d. 1249), Seigneur of Ramerupt and de V√©nisy, married Marguerite de Salins by whom he had two sons. * Marie (1215- c.1251), married firstly Gaucher, Sire de Nanteuil-la Fosse, by whom she had three children; she married secondly Hughes II, Sire de Conflans, by whom she had one son. * Marguerite (died 1275), married Thierry of Boeurs. * Heloise * Isabeau (died 1274/1277), married firstly Henry V, Count of Grandpr√©, by whom she had three children; she married secondly Jean de Picquigny * Jeanne, Dame de S√©ans-en-Othe, married before 1250 Mathieu III, Sire de Montmorency, * Sibylle, Abbess of Ramerupt * Alix Philippa died on 20 December 1250, a little more than six years after her husband. She was aged about fifty-three.

He received his academic education in Freiburg/Brsg, Zurich, Bonn and Konstanz. After his PhD in Heidelberg and his Habilitation in the Konstanz School of Criticism, he moved from Konstanz to Yale; since 1989 he has taught as professor of English at New York University, where he also founded the Poetics and Theory Program. Since 1994 he has served as founding member of the newly established European University Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder, East of Berlin. In 2009, he was made an honorary professor of philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Haverkamp was a member and co-editor of the research group Poetik und Hermeneutik in its later phase, 1979-1996. Under the influence of the Yale School of deconstruction (Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida), he developed the Konstanz School's Rezeptions√§sthetik (Wolfgang Iser, Hans Robert Jau√ü, Wolfgang Preisendanz) from a theory of literary response (Reader-response criticism) to a theory of literary latency.Katrin Truestedt, ‚ÄûAnselm Haverkamp‚ÄîGeschichte und Latenz‚Äú, in: Kultur: Theorien der Gegenwart, ed.

Relevant parts of this theory are the theory of metaphor or metaphorology, including the history of rhetoric and historical epistemology, as well as the relationship of philosophy and literature. Main references of his work include the Poetics of Aristotle, the Rhetoric of Quintilian, the Aesthetics of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, as well as the work of Benjamin and Derrida, Hans Blumenberg and Stanley Cavell. Relevant literary authors include Ovid, Shakespeare and Keats, H√∂lderlin, Joyce and Beckett. More recently, Haverkamp has extended the theory of latency into the fields of historical epistemology, art theory and legal studies.

Andr√© of Brienne, in command of the rearguard, tried to stop the fleeing crusaders and send them back into battle, but he was thrown from his horse. Covered in injuries, his screams of despair did not move his companions, not even his brother Erard, as they fled, leaving him to die there. Seven thousand other crusaders were also killed in this battle, including Gerard of Ridefort, grandmaster of the Templars. Family, marriage and issue Around 1167 he married Alix of Venizy.

The object of the game is to have the most train fares remaining at the end of the game; train fares are distributed evenly among players, and are lost when a player cannot play from their hand and for each card left when a player empties their hand. Setup The game includes: * a deck of 58 cards: ** 48 number cards (1‚Äì12) in four colors: blue, green, magenta and orange ** Four \\"Station\\" cards, one of each color ** Two \\"Free Ride\\" cards ** Two \\"End of Line\\" cards ** Two \\"Transfer\\" cards (optional) * 100 blue coin-sized \\"Train Fare\\" tokens * Plastic tray for storage, and for holding extra cards and paid fares * Instruction pamphlet Players choose the dealer by some fair means. For the normal game, the Transfer cards are removed, but they can be left in for a more advanced variation. The dealer shuffles while the train fares are distributed evenly (any remainder is placed in the tray, known as the Conductor's Pot). The dealer then deals the cards face-down, one at a time; 13 cards each for 2 or 3 players, 8 for 4 or more. The remaining cards are placed face-down to form the draw pile, known as the Conductor's Hand. Play Starting on the dealer's left, a player checks to see if they have a Station card. If so, they play it to start the first line. If not, their turn passes (they do not need to pay a Fare at this time). If no player has a station, players draw in turn until one is found (again, not yet paying fares). Once the first Station has been played, that line is open. Players in clockwise fashion proceed to make one of the following plays per turn: # If a player has one or more cards of the same color as an open line that can be played in ascending (from 7 to 12) or descending (from 6 to 1) order to an open end of the line, he may do so. Multiple cards can be played, but the cards played must be played to one end of one line only, and the player must play in sequential order. # If a player has another Station card, he may play it along with a sequence of the same color descending from 6 or ascending from 7, if any, to open a new line. # If a player holds a specialty card (see below) that allows him to make a valid play, he may do so. # If a player cannot make any play, he must \\"Take the Train\\"; he pays one Fare to the Conductor's Pot, and draws a card from the Conductor's Hand if it has not been exhausted. If there are no further cards to draw, players must still pay the Fare. Ending the game The game is over when one player empties his hand of cards, or alternately if a player runs out of Fares. All other players pay one Fare to the pot for each card, and the player with the most Fares left wins. =Multi-round play= The game can be played in rounds, with score kept based on the number of Fares the winning player had left. Play can then be to 100 or 250, or the highest total after a number of rounds. Specialty cards =Free Ride= A Free Ride card is a wild card that can stand in for any one number card (it cannot be a specialty or Station card). As the number card it stands in for exists, a player may, on their turn, play the card for which the Free Ride is standing in, and take the Free Ride for their own use. This counts as the play for their turn. =End of Line= An End of Line card, when placed on one end of a line, prohibits players from adding to that side of the line. To play cards that would normally be played on that end, the players must instead \\"wrap around\\" the other end of the line. For instance, if the End of Line was played on the 8 of a line, the 9 of that color, which would normally be played on the 8, instead becomes the last card that can be played on that line; the descending side must \\"wrap around\\" from 1 to 12 to 11 etc. until the 9 can be played. =Transfer= A Transfer card, used in more advanced variants, allows a player to \\"split\\" a line by branching off a sequence of a differing color, beginning from a card of which the player holds a card of the same number in a different color. For instance, with the Magenta line open, a player may not have a playable Magenta card, but DOES have an Orange 5 and a Transfer card, and the Magenta 5 has been played. The player plays the Transfer card next to the Magenta 5, then plays the Orange 5 on the other side. Orange cards 4 to 1 can now be played off of the 5 heading away from the station. Any cards that would normally lie between the Station and the number at which the Transfer was played, as well as anything to the other side of the Station, cannot be played until the Station is played.

Two competitors play with a ball, in an arena which is split into two halves with breakable blocks on both sides. The aim is to get a higher score than your opponent by breaking more blocks on your side than your opponent does. Competitors are in the form of humanoids, robots and aliens, all of which have a 'gun' of some sort enabling them to take control of the ball. The range of arenas have several pinball-style flippers which make the ball bounce off at unpredictable angles. The game can be played as one player versus a computer player (controlled with good AI for its time), or as two players competing against one another. Players can suck the ball into their gun then fire it at their blocks for points, or deliberately shoot the ball into their opponent to make them lose points. When hit, players disintegrate but instantly re-spawn with control of the ball going to the opponent. There are six characters to choose from: Maxx, a humanoid armed with a magnetic gun to control the ball; Wobbly, an alien blob of slime with eyes on stalks who sucks in and fires the ball with his elephant-like trunk; Triffid, a tripedal robot with a magnet gun built into his head; Killer, a bipedal robot with a magnet gun for a head; Tojoi, a humanoid holding a magnet gun in a spacesuit with large 80s shoulder pads; Yuri, physically identical to Maxx but with different abilities. Critical reception Sinclair User gave the game 91%, praising especially the gameplay and replayability of the game. Crash gave the game 77% overall and, whilst praising the game for its addictiveness, also criticised the awkward control system and unrealistic bouncing of the ball. Your Sinclair gave the game 8/10, praising the playability of the game but saying that \\"frustration really sets in after a long session\\".

It was released in the U.S. on 5 July 2008, and on 7 August in the U.K. At 432 pages, it is the longest book in the series. In Colfer's video blogs, he mentioned the book, saying it may not be the last, but the last one for at least three years. It is followed by Artemis Fowl: The Atlantis Complex. __TOC__ Plot Angeline Fowl, Artemis Fowl's mother contracts a debilitating disease, which Artemis worsens by trying to use magic. Artemis desperately contacts Captain Holly Short and No. 1, in hopes that they will be able to shed some new light on his mother's condition. They determine Angeline is suffering from Spelltropy, a fairy disease that is spread through the use of magic, and can only be cured by the brain fluid of the silky sifaka lemur of Madagascar. Unfortunately, the lemur is extinct, due to a ruthless deal Artemis made almost 8 years ago with a group called the Extinctionists. Foaly tells him that his mother will die without the cure. Artemis pleads for No.1 to open up the time stream, allowing him to save the lemur, and thus his mother. Foaly argues against the idea, but due to Artemis' lying to Holly, saying that she infected Angeline with Spelltropy, Holly agrees to help Artemis immediately to make up for it, and Foaly had to give in. They arrive nearly eight years earlier in Artemis' study. The time stream causes Artemis to become much hairier while Holly is physically reduced to an adolescent. Artemis assures Holly that the past Butler will quietly slip the lemur into the room (to avoid Angeline seeing it) and that they will simply be able to leave. Butler however, does not act according to Artemis' predictions. He tranquillises the two, and locks them in the trunk of the Fowl Bentley. Artemis and Holly escape with the help of Mulch Diggums, a kleptomaniac dwarf who has partnered up with Artemis in the future. After following his younger self to an animal park to retrieve the lemur, Artemis breaks into the wrong cage and is attacked by a gorilla, and Holly is forced into action. She heals his wounds with magic, and in a giddy haze of relief after realising he almost died, she kisses him. After, they save the lemur from Rathdown Park, but are forced at gunpoint to release it to young Artemis. While hurrying to the shuttleport in Tara, a guilty Artemis confesses his lie to Holly, who is outraged. Artemis redeems himself by giving Holly a chance to talk with Commander Root, who is dead in their time. Holly becomes neutral to Artemis, then thanks him. They commandeer a shuttle and fly it to Fez, Morocco, where the younger Artemis will trade the lemur to the Extinctionists for a hundred thousand euros. The money will go to an Arctic expedition, to help Artemis find his missing father. Instead of capturing the lemur, Holly is captured herself, and sold by the younger Artemis to the Extinctionists, who plan to execute her by way of an execution pit lined with flamethrowers. Older Artemis races to the rescue, but falls in the execution pit himself. There he discovers that the \\"flames\\" are holograms, and meets his old nemesis Opal Koboi, who has put the mesmer on the leader of the Extinctionists to help her collect rare species for her research. Artemis escapes, Holly finds him, and they fly back to Fowl Manor to return to the future. However Opal follows them into the time stream, escaping into the future. She takes over Angeline's body and pretends that she was Artemis' mother, but reveals herself when Artemis is about to inject the Spelltropy cure into her system. She also reveals that she caused the resembling symptoms to Spelltropy and made the whole incident herself (she dropped out of the time stream 2 days early and took control). As Koboi gloats, Artemis reveals that he is in fact the Artemis from the past. The older Artemis, returned at the same time, sneaks up to Opal and tranquilizes her. This was a shot in a million as Butler had once told him that he couldn't shoot the backside of an elephant. Despite his mental resistance, Butler was mesmerised by Opal and takes out Holly and No.1. When Butler is ordered by Koboi to take out the younger Artemis, he fights Koboi's mesmer and has a heart attack, but is revived by Artemis with a defibrillator. Opal recovers quickly and flees; however, realizing that Artemis and his forces have been significantly weakened in the battle, she returns. Artemis takes \\"the lemur\\" and flies away from the Manor grounds in a plane, luring Opal away. In the ensuing chase, Opal exhibits the astonishing strength she has won in her research on endangered animals, pulverizing entire sections of the plane with her fists, and eventually forcing Artemis to crash land on the coastline, breaking his collarbone in the process. Artemis escapes from the wreckage of the plane and runs to the shore, ascending a rope bridge and crossing over two large boulders. Opal relentlessly pursues him, eventually obtaining the lemur, only to discover that it's not actually a lemur, but Artemis' little brother's play-thing, Professor Primate. Artemis shoots the boulder which Opal is standing on and reveals it to be the shell of a kraken that was unknown to anyone except Artemis himself. The shell explodes and Opal is buried beneath the rubble. When a Lower Elements Police team search for her, they find she has disappeared. Artemis debriefs the others and finds that his mother knows everything that happened to her. Although 16-year-old Artemis Fowl had originally promised not to, No. 1 proceeded to mind-wipe the 10-year- old Artemis because the young demon warlock did not know about the promise. The 10-year-old Artemis is then sent back in time by No. 1. Nonetheless, he retains an interest in fairies that will set the original events of the series' first book in motion. It is then revealed that in addition to the initial time 'paradox' that occurs when Artemis goes back in time to save the Lemur, another (second) paradox exists, because Artemis' interest in fairies sets off a series of events, which have originated from his initial interest in fairies. In this way, both these events are dependent on each other. The series of events that inspires his interest in fairies is also dependent on the second time paradox, from which the reader concludes that a time paradox is always dependent on another. When everyone is gone, Artemis tells his mother the truth about everything, because Opal forgot to wipe his mother's mind. Critical reception The Artemis Fowl series rose from ninth to second in the children's book section of the New York Times bestselling list, and remained there for some time after it achieved the place on the week of the US release. Stuart Kelly commented, \\"Why Harry Potter became a phenomenon while Artemis Fowl only remains a huge sensation is a conundrum for future ages to ponder... Colfer doesn't handle time-travel, he revels in it.\\" VOYA remarked, \\"Colfer delivers another great story filled with action, drama, and clever plot twists that will please new readers as well as series fans. What sets this series apart, however, is its ability to rise above predictability. The characters change and grow more complex with each book... This combination of ingenious plot and authentic characters who evolve over time is a pleasure to read and leaves readers begging for more.\\" There is also a special limited paperback edition including the short story \\"LEPrecon,\\" originally published in The Artemis Fowl Files.

Function The protein encoded by this gene may function as an endogenous suppressor of TGF-beta signaling and inhibits differentiation by blocking the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300, class I histone deacetylase, HDACs. The N-terminal portion of EID-2 was required for the binding to HDACs. This region was also involved in the transcriptional repression and nuclear localization, suggesting the importance of the involvement of HDACs in the EID-2 function. EID-2 inhibits TGF-beta/Smad transcriptional responses. EID-2 interacts constitutively with Smad proteins, and most strongly with Smad3. Stable expression of EID-2 in the TGF- beta1-responsive cell line inhibits endogenous Smad3-Smad4 complex formation and TGF-beta1-induced expression of p21 and p15. EID-2 displays developmentally regulated expression with high levels in adult heart and brain. Overexpression of EID-2 inhibits muscle-specific gene expression through inhibition of MyoD-dependent transcription. This inhibitory effect on gene expression can be explained by EID-2's ability to associate with and inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of p300.

He was best known for his 2007 book, Deer Hunting With Jesus: Dispatches From America's Class War. Early life As a child Bageant had lived in the insular, hardscrabble farming community of Unger, West Virginia and later just over the state line in the town of Winchester, Virginia and attended John Handley High School there. His teachers told him that he wasn‚Äôt cut out for college, and his parents pressured him to work from an early age. Bageant quit school, joined the navy, and got married. He was discharged in the 1960s. He bought an old school bus and headed for San Francisco. En route, the bus broke down in Boulder, Colorado. Bageant and his young family lived there, sometimes on the bus, for several years, before moving to an Indian reservation in Idaho. During that time, Bageant worked at blue collar jobs until, in the mid-1970s, he broke his back and had to lie flat for months while he recuperated. It was then that he started honing his writing skills, using his convalescence to perfect a prose style that would, over the years, acquire a cult following. In 2001, Bageant moved back to Winchester. Progressive author In Deer Hunting With Jesus, Bageant discusses how the Democratic Party lost the political support of poor rural whites and how the Republican Party has convinced them to \\"vote against their own economic self- interest.\\" The book is mainly centered on his hometown, Winchester. In 2010, Bageant published a similarly themed book, Rainbow Pie: A Redneck Memoir. Bageant used his extended family's experience after World War II to describe the social hierarchy in the United States. The book examines the postwar journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became, the author argues, the foundation of a permanent white underclass and comprise much of today's heartland red state voters. Bageant frequently appeared as a commentator on radio and television internationally and wrote a progressive online column distributed to hundreds of blogs and websites. He maintained his own blog joebageant.net, assisted by Ken Smith, who continued editing the blog after Bageant's death. Bageant also served as a senior (roving) editor for Cyrano's Journal Today and The Greanville Post, two sites devoted to progressive political and media analyses.The Greanville Post Later life During the last years of his life, Bageant lived in Ajijic, a small town on Lake Chapala in central Mexico. He had been living in Ajijic, where he wrote Rainbow Pie, when he learned that he had a fast-growing and inoperable cancer. On January 4, 2011, Bageant announced on his web site that he had been \\"struck down by an extremely serious form of cancer\\" that was inoperable and so he was unable to engage in correspondence or his usual work, but he hoped to be able to resume them in the future. On March 27, 2011, it was announced on his website that Bageant had died on March 26 following \\"a vibrant life\\" and a four-month struggle with cancer. Legacy After Bageant's death, his Australian publisher asked Bageant's literary executor, Ken Smith, to select and edit about 80,000 words of his essays. The book was published in November 2011 as Waltzing at the Doomsday Ball: The Best of Joe Bageant. This posthumous collection was available only in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa where, according to Smith, it sold reasonably well. According to Smith, \\"no American publisher is yet interested in a book by a redneck socialist‚Äîand that says a lot about American culture and the US book business.\\" Bageant's friends at The Greanville Post voted him as editor emeritus of the publication. In addition to being Bageant's literary executor, Ken Smith maintained Bageant's websites. Smith himself died in 2016 and with the continuation of the website being uncertain, a new website has been created at JoeBageant.org.

It was released by American publisher Platinum Studios in 2006. Publication history Platinum Studios founder & chairman Rosenberg came up with the Cowboys & Aliens concept in 1997. Rosenberg and European rights agent Ervin Rustemagiƒá had tried to sell the film rights to the Western comic Tex, but were not finding success. Instead, Rosenberg's employee Greg Noveck came up with a title: Cowboys and Aliens. Rosenberg had Noveck and another employee, Paul Benjamin, work up a film pitch, including character designs. Using their one-sheet, Rosenberg and Rustemagiƒá (represented by William Morris Agency) got film rights interest from such studios as Universal Pictures, DreamWorks Studios, Fox Family Films, Columbia Pictures, Walt Disney Entertainment, and Paramount Pictures.Johnston. Rich. \\"The Secret Story Behind Cowboys And Aliens,\\" Bleeding Cool (July 29, 2011). In May 1997, Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Studios acquired the rights to Cowboys & Aliens, which was described as a \\"graphic novel in development.\\"Fleming, Michael. \\"D'Works, U lasso 'Cowboys',\\" Variety (May 20, 1997). By the mid-2000s, with the project in turnaround, Rosenberg commissioned writers Fred Van Lente & Andrew Foley and artists Dennis Calero & Luciano Lima to create an Cowboys & Aliens original graphic novel, which was published in December 2006 by Platinum Studios Comics.  Controversy  In order to make the Cowboys & Aliens comic appear to be a big seller, Platinum Studios priced the 105-page book at the low cost of $4.99 (when most graphic novels were $10 and up). Platinum attempted to game the system in various other ways, including using a business arrangement with the popular publisher Top Cow Productions to list Cowboys & Aliens in Top Cow's section of the Diamond Comic Distributors catalogue. They also gave certain retailers huge bulk discounts on the book, all of which counted toward sales numbers. Based on these inflated numbers, Entertainment Weekly listed Cowboys & Aliens as a top seller for the month, which prompted Universal/DreamWorks to move the film project forward again. Plot synopsis In 1873, gunslingers Zeke Jackson and Verity Jones are hired to protect a caravan that is heading to Silver City, Arizona, to work at a silver mine. They are ambushed by Apache Indians in the desert and the two groups witness the crash-landing of an alien spaceship. Its inhabitants, led by Commander Rado Dar, exterminate some of the Indians, allowing Zeke and Verity to escape, as the aliens set out to conquer the planet Earth. While the aliens regroup and destroy a nearby fort, Zeke and Verity arrive at Silver City with the settlers, only to discover that, aside from a handyman named Alan Cross (the original founder and mayor of the city), most of the town's inhabitants left after it was discovered that the silver mines were empty. The cowboys are attacked by aliens riding in flying motorcycle-like vehicles and are chased to a cliff, where they are rescued by Apache Indians led by Chief Medicine Crow and the warrior Warhawk, who ambush the aliens. The two groups decide to join forces in order to defeat the aliens, and scavenge the fallen ones for weapons. Zeke steals a microwave- emitting pistol, Verity steals an energy whip, Warhawk steals X-Ray goggles and the other Indians steal explosives that they attach to their arrows. A blacksmith uses the scraps of the motorcycles to forge anti-gravity horseshoes that allow the Indians to ride on flying horses. The humans also receive the assistance of Commander Dar's assistant, Ra Chak Kai, who has switched sides and falls in love with Zeke. She reveals that the aliens (who call themselves The Caste) have taken over Silver City and are building a communication device that will allow them to call in troops from their homeworld to enslave the entire Earth. Verity and Warhawk also fall in love. Cross offers to lead a decoy group on a frontal attack against the aliens, allowing a second group led by Zeke to infiltrate the city through the empty silver mines and attack. Cross betrays them, in hopes of being spared by the aliens. The humans are captured, including Cross, who, despite his treachery, is thrown in with the other human prisoners and is killed by Verity. The captured humans are set for execution at dawn, just as the beacon is about to send its transmission, but the rest of the Indians arrive on their flying horses and defeat most of the aliens. Zeke and Kai kill Commander Dar while Verity and Warhawk deal with his second-in-command and destroy the aliens' communications tower. As the humans celebrate their victory, Kai is secretly revealed to be part of a race of shapeshifting aliens that have organized a resistance against the Caste warlords. For their bravery, the humans are added to the list of races with the strength needed to stand against the Caste.

He was the 22nd Governor of Reserve Bank of India, served under Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh. He lives in Singapore and is a distinguished visiting faculty at National University of Singapore.http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/former-india-central-bank- governor-dr-duvvuri-subbarao-appointed-distinguished-visiting-1903853.htm Subbarao is a 1972 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre. He was appointed the 22nd Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 5 September 2008, with an extension in 2011 till 4 September 2013.  Early life  Subbarao's hometown is Eluru in West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. He did his schooling from the Sainik School in Korukonda, Andhra Pradesh. He graduated in Physics B.Sc Hons. from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (class of 1969). He received a M.Sc degree also in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. Subbarao topped the Civil Services Examination in 1972 and was assigned the Andhra Pradesh cadre. In 1978, he did a master's degree in economics from Ohio State University, United States. After a few years, Subbarao joined the Humphrey Fellowship program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study Quantitative Economic Modelling. He became a Humphrey Fellow at MIT in 1982. He later received a Ph.D. in Economics from Andhra University. His doctoral thesis was titled \\"Fiscal reforms at the sub-national level\\" (1998)  Career  Subbarao, a well known economist is equally well studied in Physics. He had taken physics during his Masters at Indian Institute of Technology as well as for his Civil Services examination. He was the first person to have reviewed Stephen Hawkings's \\"Brief history of time\\" in Illustrated weekly, under the title \\"from here to eternity\\". Subbarao worked as the joint secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India between 1988 and 1993. Subsequently, he became the Finance Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh between 1993 and 1998. On completion of his term, he was deputed as lead economist in the World Bank from 1999 to 2004. On completion of his term, he was appointed to the Prime Ministers‚Äô Economic Advisory Council from 2005 to 2007 before he was elevated as the Finance Secretary in 2007. On 5 September 2008, he was appointed the twenty-second Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Arun Ramanathan was appointed as Finance Secretary on 21 September 2008 in his vacancy. His term was extended for two more years in 2011. Subbarao was involved in the initiation of fiscal reforms at the state level and had managed a flagship study on decentralisation across major countries of East Asia including China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and Cambodia.He is credited with financial turnaround of Andhra Pradesh in late nineties when the state had slipped into an unprecedented fiscal crisis  Achievements  During his tenure as Governor of RBI, Dr Subbarao took initiatives for demystification of the Central Bank, including lucid presentation of terse macro economic concepts in the RBI publications and grassroots level interaction with the masses through various financial inclusion, financial literacy and village outreach programmes. He was instrumental in ensuring 100% meaningful financial inclusion in Ernakulam district of Kerala. In February 2012, Subbarao expounded his world-famous theory on the New Trilemma of Central Bankers, which he named as the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of price stability, financial stability and sovereign debt sustainability as against Mundell's well known \\"Impossible Trinity\\" of fixed exchange rate, free capital flows and independent monetary policy. Subbarao's erudite exposition on holy trinity firmly established the Indian perspective in the scholastic debate on the global central banking trilemma. Dr Subbarao's taking charge as RBI Governor in 2008 was coincident with the outbreak of the Global Financial Crisis. Subbarao is generally credited as having safely stewarded Indian economy through the financial crisis. However, it was during Subbarao's tenure that the value of Indian Rupee tumbled spectacularly, with USD/INR exchange rate for the first time breaching the psychological barrier of 60, and even hitting a new low of 69.  Controversies  Subbarao is known to have a mind of his own and frequently vetoes / overrides the opinion of his fellow members in the Technical Advisory Group on Monetary Policy. He is criticized as lacking democratic spirit by regularly going against majority opinion of fellow experts in the apex level committee. During Subbarao's last days at the helm of RBI, the banking industry in India was rocked by the infamous Cobra Post expose of money laundering by leading Indian banks through violation of RBI's KYC guidelines, which pointed to the slackness and loopholes in the supervisory role of RBI. Dr Subbarao was also drawn into controversy when a whistleblowing complaint written to him in October 2012 by the noted activist Devidas Tuljapurkar against fraudulent activities of Bank of Maharashtra, was routinely and unthinkingly forwarded by the RBI Governor to the very organisation against which the complaint had been made. This led to alleged and massive harassment of Tuljapurkar (an ex-Director of Bank of Maharashtra) by the bank management, undermining the abject failure of whistle-blowing policy in both RBI and BoM.  Personal life  He is married to Urmila Subbarao. They have two sons, Mallik and Raghav, who are both IIT graduates like their father. Selected works Subbarao's book, \\"Who Moved My Interest Rate?: Leading the Reserve Bank of India Through Five Turbulent Years\\", was published in July 2016.https://www.amazon.in/Who-Moved-Interest-Rate- Turbulent/dp/0670088927http://www.business-standard.com/article/current- affairs/i-paid-the-price-for-asserting-rbi-s-autonomy- subbarao-116071500008_1.htmlhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a497adbc-53eb-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef.htmlhttp://www.livemint.com/Politics/8WUnYsNQMHPHBxaD5i6v9J/Governments- must-show-respect-for-RBI-autonomy-D-Subbarao.html  References  1949 births Indian Administrative Service officers Living people Governors of the Reserve Bank of India Sainik School alumni Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur alumni Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur alumni Andhra University alumni Ohio State University alumni People from Eluru Businesspeople from Andhra Pradesh Scientists from Andhra Pradesh 20th-century Indian economists 21st-century Indian economists ","title":"Duvvuri Subbarao"},{"id":"19133439","text":"Museo della Deportazione e Resistenza (Deportation and Resistance Museum) in Prato The Museo e Centro di Documentazione della Deportazione e Resistenza (\\"Museum and Centre of Documentation of Deportation and Italian Resistance\\") is a museum in Prato, central Italy, dedicated to the history of Fascism's occurrence and rise to power in Italy. The director of the foundation is Camilla Brunelli. It records the political, racial, and religious persecution and deportation of people in concentration and extermination camps and with resistance during World War II.  History  The institution is located in Figline di Prato, where on 6 September 1944, 29 partisans were killed by German armed Forces. It was one of hundreds of mass murders committed by German troops in the Tuscany Region. Today's museum and documentation centre are only a stone's throw away from the site of the massacre. However, the content of the exhibition is marked by another historical event: In March 1944, following a general strike in occupied northern and central Italy, hundreds of Tuscans and over one hundred Prateser were deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp and the majority then further to the Ebensee neighbouring camp. When choosing the location of the museum, a factory hall in the centre of the city was therefore also in consideration. In the end, however, Figline was chosen as an \\"authentic site of a Nazi massacre\\". The initiative to build a museum in memory of the events of that time came from a few survivors in Prates, including Roberto Castellani. The financing was provided by the municipality of Prato and the museum and the documentation centre were opened on 10 April 2002 in a solemn ceremony attended by the then Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Initially under the administration of the Municipality, since February 2008 it has been a foundation created by the Municipalities of the Province of Prato, the ANED (National Association of Former Political Deportees in Nazi Camps), the Associazione Nazionale Partigiani d'Italia (National Association of Italian Partisans) and the Jewish Community of Florence. Since 2008, the museum has also been the place of action for the Austrian Memorial Service.  Exhibition  Conference room of the Documentation Centre After a thematic introduction to the Nazi camp system, the Mauthausen concentration camp with its neighbouring camp Ebensee and an overview of the deportation from the Tuscany region, the main part of the exhibition, which extends over about 70 square metres, consists of objects from the tunnels of the Ebensee concentration camp. These were collected in the 1970s by Prateser survivors together with fellow citizens and finally donated to the Museum. The museum also houses the former bell of the Ebensee camp roll call square, on loan from the municipality of Ebensee and an expression of the Prato-Ebensee town partner agreement made in 1987. The contents of the museum are particularly aimed at pupils from the 8th grade onwards, but also at interested citizens of the region and from abroad. Admission is free of Charge.  The Documentation Center  The Documentation Centre is located on the first floor of the building. It has a conference hall with 70 seats, a library with about 3000 media items and three computer terminals. The research work is carried out not only in cooperation with local institutions and experts, but also within the framework of international projects and in cooperation with the partner institution, the Ebensee Museum of Contemporary History.

She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Pacific Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line. Construction Watchman (YAGR-16) was laid down on 17 January 1945, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 2343, as the Liberty Ship Vernon S. Hood, by J.A. Jones Construction, Panama City, Florida. She was launched 20 February 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Inez Bulifant; and delivered 7 March 1945, to MARCOM. Service history Merchant service Following a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, the freighter was turned over to the Overlakes Freight Corporation, to be operated by that firm under a contract with the MARCOM. During her brief period of active operations with MARCOM, 1945 to 1947, she also served under contract with the Moore-McCormack Lines. Later that year, she was placed out of service and was berthed with the James River Reserve Fleet, Lee Hall, Virginia. US Navy service The ship remained there until mid-1958 when she was taken over by the US Navy and converted to a radar picket ship at the Charleston Navy Yard, Charleston, South Carolina. During conversion, she was renamed Watchman and received the designation YAGR-16. However, that designation was changed to AGR-16 before she completed her conversion late in the year. On 5 January 1958, Watchman was placed in commission at Charleston, Lieutenant Commander Irvin Boaz in command. Watchman conducted shakedown training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area during February. Following post-shakedown availability at Charleston, from 5 to 18 March, she completed repairs and got underway for the US West Coast. After transiting the Panama Canal, and visiting Acapulco, Mexico, she arrived in her new home port, San Francisco, California, on 11 April. Assigned to the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), she served as one of several radar picket ships operating as seaborne extensions of the command's contiguous radar coverage system. She operated from her base at San Francisco, during her entire naval career, spending an average of 200 days per year actually at sea engaged in picket patrols. That routine continued until 1 September 1965, at which time she and the remaining AGRs were placed out of commission. Decommissioning Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 September 1965, and she was returned to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for lay up with the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, California. She remained there until 3 October 1974, when she was sold to American Ship Dismantlers for scrapping.

His work as a reviewer took him to Mostra di Venezia and festivals in Locarno, Karlovy Vary and others. In 1961, he began teaching English Literature in Italian high schools. In 1969, he took a Ph.degree in \\"Film history and criticism\\" and taught for several years in state and private universities. From 1963 to 1975, he was on the managing committee of the Incontri internazionali del Cinema in Sorrento, the Italian Centre of Filmology. Several of his essays have been translated into Danish, English, Russian, American and quoted in foreign books on cinema. He currently lives in Vomero, Naples.

Life The seventh child of Pierre- Fran√ßois Bultos and his wife Marie-Jos√®phe Lambert, wine merchants and hoteliers, Alexandre made his stage debut in December 1761 aged 12, in La Servante ma√Ætresse by Pierre Baurans, after the work by Pergolesi, beside his close contemporary Ang√©lique D'Hannetaire (like him, a student of Ignaz Vitzthumb, music-master of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie). When this play was reprised two months later, Fran√ßois-Antoine de Chevrier wrote: From 1767 to 1770 he was part of the Ghent troupe, acted at Strasbourg in 1770, and then acted at Maastricht in Charles Bernardy's troupe, before finally getting to Copenhagen under his own steam. Taken on at Brussels in 1772 as an ensemble member then as Laruette and his comic leads from 1773, he divided his duties with Dazincourt, which sometimes led to tension between Dazincourt and Bultos. Dazincourt left Brussels for Paris in 1776, leaving Bultos alone to fill the lead roles. In 1777 Bultos and his father obtained permission to open a Vauxhall in the Parc de Bruxelles and the same year Alexandre became co- director of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie alongside Louis-Jean Pin. Five years later, he made his brother Herman (1752-1801) his co-director. Around 1785 he tried to make a debut at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise but was dissuaded by his contemporaries.

Bussone's involvement in her adolescence in parish activities led her to Catholic Action as well as to other movements that she served as an active participant; she learnt the guitar and liked sports and music which she engaged in with her close friends. But those who knew her attested to her deep spiritual desires which she found sated in the Focolore Movement that she first came into contact with in the late 1960s. Bussone desired to act as a vessel for the goodness of God and desired that He would \\"... use me as He wants\\". Bussone died in an accident in 1970 and there were immediate calls to launch a process for beatification due to the impact she had made on local communities. The cause for her beatification - which saw her declared as a Servant of God - commenced in mid-1997 under Pope John Paul II. On 18 March 2015 Pope Francis declared her to be Venerable after confirming her life of heroic virtue. Life Maria Orsola Bussone was born on 2 October 1954 in Vallo Torinese in Turin in the home of her maternal grandmother at 10:30pm as the first of two children to Umberto and Luigina; her brother Giorgio (b. 7.5.1957) followed. Her father owned a car repair office and her mother was a basic tailor (a \\"sarta\\"). Father Giuseppe Michelotti baptized her on 10 October. Bussone attended kindergarten under the Cottolengo Sisters at Monasterolo Casotto and was at school in Vallo from 1 October 1960 until 21 June 1965. Bussone made her First Communion on 23 April 1961 and received her Confirmation on 11 July 1965. In this time she loved the pop music of the 1960s and served as an active participant in the Catholic Action movement and the Maria Goretti Youth Group at the San Secondo Martire parish; she was also interested in peaceful student protests and viewed them as a democratic tool. Her love for sports and nature (activities such as skiing and skating) was also noted and she and her friends often spent time doing various sporting activities. High school began in autumn 1965 and concluded in summer 1968 (at the Federico Albert Institute in Lanzo under the nuns) when she began school in another place (in October 1968 at the Galileo Ferraris State High School in Ciri√© travelling there via bus). In 1969 she won a national competition for an essay entitled \\"The European Community\\" and she was rewarded with a trip to Brussels as well as to Strasbourg and Luxembourg. In 1968 she began to learn the guitar and to sing at a music school in Turin. In 1966 she attended a retreat in Lanzo and the preacher Vincenzo Chiarle gave a sermon that affected Bussone and inspired her to attend similar retreats to broaden her spiritual horizons. Bussone attended a congress of the Focolare Movement for the first time from 3‚Äì5 June 1967 in Rocca di Papa and it had a profound effect on her to the point that she desired to join them as a means of strengthening her own faith and her own activism. En route home from that congress she and her friends stopped over in Loppiano in Florence. Since her childhood she attended with great participation to the activities in her parish and could be present to several meetings of children and adolescents in the Gen Movement which was the Youth Branch to the Focolare Movement. The first one she attended was in April 1968 at the invitation of Father Vincenzo Chiarle. The charism of that movement impressed her to the point that in a letter sent to Chiara Lubich - the founder - said that she wanted to inspire all her life unconditional love towards other people letting \\"God use me as He wants\\" as a tool to bring others closer to Him. Seven months into 1970 she - who liked to sing with other adolescents in her parish and liked the guitar - went on a trip near Venice as an animator in the parish school-camp located at Ca' Savio alongside her brother Giorgio. It was during her time there that a trivial accident caused her death; she died of an electrical discharge while she dried her hair with a defective hair-dryer as she prepared to attend Mass. Her cousin Marisa entered the room around 8:00pm to find Bussone on the ground and inert though artificial respiration and heart massage failed to prevent her death. Bishop Livio Maritano presided over her funeral on 13 July which saw 30 priests attend as well as more than 2000 people from 50 different parishes. Since 2 October 2004 her remains have been housed at the San Secondo Martire parish church. Beatification process The beatification process commenced under Pope John Paul II on 17 July 2017 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the edict of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against to the cause) and titled Bussone as a Servant of God. Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini inaugurated the diocesan process of investigation on 26 May 1996 while the process reached a successful conclusion under Severino Poletto on 17 December 2000. The C.C.S. received all the documents that came from the Turin process and validated it on 15 June 2001 prior to receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation officials in 2003 for further evaluation. Theologians advising the congregation met to examine the Positio's contents and voiced their approval to the cause on 17 September 2013 while the C.C.S. members themselves later approved the cause as well on 17 March 2015. Bussone was declared to be Venerable on 18 March 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. Failed miracle Bussone's beatification all depends on one miracle being confirmed which often is a healing that science cannot explain. Such a case had been investigated in the diocese of its origin and that process received C.C.S. validation on 27 January 2006. But the supposed miracle could not be investigated until Bussone had been declared as Venerable. The medical board investigated this miracle sometime in 2015 but did not issue a unanimous verdict as is required ruling the healing not to be a miracle. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Waldery Hilgeman.

It was first published in 1915 in the journal Rogue.Buttel, p. 129 Interpretation Eleanor Cook observes that \\"Tea\\" is one of two \\"seemingly (but far from) slight poems that close both editions of Harmonium,\\" adding that this \\"eight- line, one-sentence, free-verse virtuoso performance\\" offers a very effective implicit leave-taking.Cook, p. 85 (The other poem she is referring to is \\"To the Roaring Wind\\", quoted at the bottom of the main Harmonium essay.) Cook compares \\"Tea\\" to Domination of Black, as being representative of \\"all the troping of leaves through the collection\\".Cook, p. 85 She suggests that the reference to Java may be significant not only because it was a center of tea- trade, but also because its sophisticated court culture at one time, notable for its subtleties and appreciation of artists, \\"made it the kind of culture that Stevens especially liked\\".Cook, p. 86 She also suggests that the poem expresses \\"Stevens's delicately implicit trope of drinking tea as a metaphor for reading (ingesting a drink from leaves).\\"Cook, p. 85 She notes that Stevens was a tea-fancier.Cook, p. 85 Robert Buttel characterizes this poem as light, witty, and rococo, and as displaying compression, concentration, and precision. \\"The last four lines set the world of civilized order against the outdoor coldness,\\" he writes, \\"ending on a note of exotic beauty, color, and elegance....\\"Buttel, pp. 29‚Äì30 He suggests that the experience or feeling of being civilized is presented symbolically in \\"Tea\\". It is one of the two earliest Stevens poems to combine wit and elegance, according to Buttel, the other being \\"Cy est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et les Unze Mille Vierges\\", also published in 1915. The two poems are proofs that by 1915 Stevens had mastered the tools in the workshop of nineteenth-century poetry that he had set himself to learn, including imagism, impressionism, and symbolism. As mentioned in the main Harmonium essay (see the section \\"The Mind of China\\"), the poem shows the influence of orientalism on Stevens's work.  Media   Notes   References  * Buttel, Robert.

Early life and education  Dwight Stansel was born in Lake City, Columbia County, Florida to Bobby E. and Maudell J. Stansel, both of whom came from farming families. He grew up on the family farm in Wellborn, and graduated from Suwannee High School in 1964. Stansel was raised Southern Baptist, and is a member of Mt. Beulah Baptist Church, in Wellborn, Florida.  Career   Early career, and career outside politics  After high school, Stansel joined the Florida National Guard, where he served for 10 years. Prior to purchasing the family farm and taking over the operations in 1986, Dwight was an airport manager at the Suwannee County airport. His father had already decided that the farm would be divided up amongst the four children and they could do as they pleased with their share of the land. Dwight's siblings, however, really had no interest in farming, and conceded their share of the land, allowing Dwight to take majority ownership, keep the farm going, and ensure that the land would remain with the family. Thus it became the Dwight Stansel Farm and Nursery. After taking over the operation of the farm that was started in the 1880s in Wellborn, by his grandparents, John Vincent Stansel, and Kate Geneva (Stevens) Stansel, Dwight grew the farm into a very profitable business growing pine trees, tobacco, and peanuts, and raising chickens. Since 1986, the farm has more than doubled in size, and now covers several hundred acres of land. Today, Dwight is still general manager, mostly overseeing the tree farm. He stopped growing tobacco, son Erwin manages the peanut farm, and Dwight's wife, Glenda manages the poultry farm.  House of Representatives (1998‚Äì2006)  Dwight Stansel was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, District 11 seat in 1998. When he took office in 1998, his District included the following counties: Columbia, Hamilton, Lafayette, Madison, Suwannee and parts of Dixie and Gilchrist. In 2003, the area his district covered was then changed to include the following counties: Gilchrist, Lafayette, Suwannee, and parts of Alachua, Columbia, and Dixie. Today, the district still represents the same general area, excluding Dixie County. While in Legislature, Stansel became Vice Chairman of the State Agriculture Committee. He also served on the Agriculture and Environment Appropriations Committee, the Select Committee to Protect Private Property Rights, the State Infrastructure Council, State Resources Council, and the Transportation Committee. While in office, Stansel sponsored seven bills. All but two of them died. The University of Florida Men's Basketball Team Bill (HR 9089) that Stansel sponsored passed unanimously, and state of Florida honored the 2006 UF Men's Basketball Team for winning the championship. He co- sponsored several other bills which includes the Affordable Housing Bill (HB 1363), and the Land Acquisition Management Bill (HB 1347). Being a farmer, and avid hunter, Stansel sponsored many land ownership and property rights bills as well as gun laws, and hunting regulations bills. He retired from the House in 2006 due to term limits. Stansel is also known for cracking the whip during the Florida House's annual \\"Boot Day\\", and explaining how it was used much more commonly in the early days of Florida, for cattle drives- which is where the term \\"cracker\\", or \\"Florida Cracker\\" came from.

Muhammad's reign was briefly interrupted by his brother Abu Ja'far Ahmad, who, like his Abbasid contemporary Al-Wathiq, supported the Mu'tazili and persecuted their Sunni opponents, executing some and imprisoning others, most notably the Maliki scholar and jurist Sahnun. When Muhammad Abu'l-Abbas regained the throne in 847, he sent his brother into exile and rehabilitated the Sunnis, making Maliki Sahnun chief qadi of Ifriqiya. He had the reputation of being sympathetic to the Sunnis. For these, it was claimed that he left Shiism and adopted the Sunni doctrine. Death Muhammad I died in Palermo in 856.

She finished her college career with 23 goals and 43 assists. They retired her No. 8 jersey. Playing career International In 1997, Whalen began her career for the United States women's national soccer team as an outside defender. She earned her first cap against France, while still in college. The following year, 1998, Whalen had a very successful season scoring two goals and garnering three assists. Her role on the team was constantly redefined. She usually appeared as a late game substitute to add attacking speed from a wild midfield post. Because of her versatility, she could either increase the attacking pressure or function as a defensive midfielder as the game situation demands. In 1999, Whalen helped the US Women's National Team win the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. This group is famously dubbed the \\"99er's\\"; each player helped change the face of women's sports forever. The World Cup was hosted in the United States in various stadiums including the Rose Bowl, Soldier Field, and Sanford Stadium. In the final game against China, neither side had scored and the game moved from extra time to penalty kicks. Whalen played every minute of extra-time in the final against China. Although she did not take a penalty kick, Whalen was the first to run up to Brandi Chastain after she secured the victory for the United States. Both were featured on the cover of Time Magazine and today it is still one of the most iconic images in sports history.

On June 26, 2002, in a game against the Carolina Courage, Whalen tore her ACL and MCL in a collision with German international Birgit Prinz. This occurred just after recovering from a broken rib. Whalen had surgery, but noticed her knee was infected shortly thereafter. During her second surgery Whalen had a severe allergic reaction, nearly dying.\\"Sara Whalen Hess, a former Olympian, gives advice for raising athletic kids without ruining their lives‚Äîor yours (she's a psychologist too)\\" ‚Äî Quartz The doctors realized that the infection was in one of the screws, within the ligament of her knee, which had to be removed. Whalen had to go through seven surgeries, including moving ligaments from her right to left knee, to repair her injury. This marked the end of her professional soccer career. During this injury time, she descended into a very dark place and questioned if she wanted to continue living. She felt that she had to grieve a life that she was leaving behind. She felt so much pain she stated, \\"your body can only sustain so much pain. It was like, ‚ÄòJust f****** end it. I can‚Äôt deal with this anymore.‚Äô‚Äù Her husband, Jon stated, \\"It's more than just playing soccer. You lose that sense of purpose.\\" She was slowly able to piece back her life together and she used her education to sustain herself. It was a way for Whalen to occupy her time with something other than rehab on her knee. She was worrisome that she would not be good at a job in the psychology field because of all the trauma she endured. She was able to feel like she got some ownership back in her story and feels like her story helps her with her job. In 2004, after numerous leg surgeries she was able to run the New York Marathon in 4 hours 19 minutes and 38 seconds. After this event, she felt that she truly regained control of her narrative.

She is now a licensed psychologist and cognitive behavioral therapist. Looking back on her time at the World Cup and with the Women's National Team she says, \\"we have some piece of history that will never change and that we all feel really incredible about having in our back pocket. Whether we're playing soccer or coaching or aren't doing anything related to soccer, its still apart of our identity which is really, really special.\\" She continues, \\"because of how much media plays a role in everything now, it's actually very difficult to be very humble because you sort of have to be an image, and you have to market yourself. I think it was a more enjoyable time to play then, maybe because we didn't have that concern. We were just wanting to win. We didn't have to look a certain way or be a certain thing, which was very much a blessing.\\" Whalen was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Soccer Category with the Class of 2001.

Similarly, Finnish author Virpi Ruohom√§ki states that \\"a simulation game combines the features of a game (competition, cooperation, rules, participants, roles) with those of a simulation (incorporation of critical features of reality). A game is a simulation game if its rules refer to an empirical model of reality.\\" A properly built simulation game used to teach or learn economics would closely follow the assumptions and rules of the theoretical models within this discipline. __TOC__ In economics education Economics education studies recommend the adoption of more active and collaborative learning methodologies (Greenlaw, 1999). Simkins (1999) stated \\"‚Ä¶ teaching practices, which rely heavily on the lecture format, are not doing enough to develop students' cognitive learning skills, attract good students to economics, and motivate them to continue coursework in the discipline.\\" (p. 278). This is consistent with the results of a survey published in the American Economic Review by Allgood (2004) that shows that students \\"rarely take economics as a free elective ‚Äì especially beyond principles.\\" (p. 5). More is needed to be done in the classroom to excite students about economics education. Simulations supplement the standard lecture. Both computerized and non-computer based simulation and games show significant levels of growth in education (see Lean, Moizer, Towler, and Abbey, 2006; Dobbins, Boehlje, Erickson and Taylor, 1995; Gentry, 1990;. Example in monopolistic competition Through a simulation game, students may participate directly in a market by managing a simulated firm and making decisions on price and production to maximize profits. An excellent review of the use of a successful market simulation is given by Motahar (1994) in the Journal of Economics Education. A monopolistic competition simulation game can be used as an example in the standard economics classroom or for experimental economics. Economic experiments using monopolistic competition simulations can create real-world incentives that may be used in the teaching and learning of economics to help students better understand why markets and other exchange systems work the way they do. An explanation of experimental economics is given by Roth (1995). Assumptions of monopolistic competition A simulation game in monopolistic competition needs to incorporate the standard theoretical assumptions of this market structure, including: * Many buyers and sellers * Easy entry and exit * Some degree of product differentiation * Zero economic profits in the long-run In a simulation of monopolistic competition, each firm must be small in size, and should not be able to influence the direction of the overall market. Yet each firm has some control over price owing to product differentiation. To be consistent with economic theory, the simulation model should allow entry of new firms to occur as long as profits are greater than normal, and economic profits exist. The entry of new firms will decrease the market price, and eventually cause economic profits to return to zero (see Baye, 2009). Controllable decisions in monopolistic competition To simulate monopolistic competition, the controllable firm decisions of the participants (students) must include, at a minimum, those specified in the standard theoretical model, including (see Baye, 2009): * Firm price * Advertising * Firm production * Plant Size Simulation game experience From an educational point of view, students will have an \\"opportunity\\" to learn by their own observations and experience through participation in a simulation game (see Schmidt, 2003). Consistent with the theoretical model of monopolistic competition (see Baye, 2009), student participants would observe and experience that their pricing decisions are controlled by the market. They would \\"experience\\" that in the simulation they would have to lower their firm's price to be competitive as new firms entered the market. In the long- run, they would see the impact of changing plant size. They would observe that the successful firms would take advantage of economies of scale, but would also be careful not to incur diseconomies of scale in the long-run. Students would experience that economic profits cannot be maintained in the long-run. They would see, first hand, that their accounting profits will inevitably decline and move closer to normal profits. This experience provides students an opportunity to learn (as a supplement to the lecture and readings) the economic messages of monopolistic competition.  Examples in Macroeconomics  A simple baseline economy model has been proposed by M. Lengnick (2013). This model consists of two types of economic actors only: households playing the roles of workers/employees and consumers, and firms playing the roles of employers and producers/suppliers. All firms produce and sell the same abstract consumption good that is bought (and consumed) by households. The model has originally been implemented in Java, but is also available as a web- based simulation. In 2018, Harvard Business Publishing published \\"Macroeconomics Simulation: Econland\\". This 30-minute simulation brings economic policy making to life by allowing students to make monetary and fiscal policy decisions and consider their impact on the economy of a fictional country. Students manage the economy through a 7-year business cycle in an effort to maximize the approval rating from their population. Exploring the trade-offs of economic policy decision-making and the effects of the global economic environment on a country, students consolidate their understanding of core macroeconomic concepts, including GDP, unemployment, inflation, and budget deficit. At a deeper level, students develop critical thinking skills and learn about economic modeling and system dynamics. The simulation won a Silver Medal at the International Serious Play Awards.

Plot The Gargoyle follows two different time lines, one in the form of a story (or ‚Äòmemory‚Äô), and one in real time. In real time, an unnamed atheist and former hardcore porn star with a troubled childhood is driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Hallucinating that a volley of arrows is being shot at him from a forest, he swerves off the road and into a ravine. There his car sets alight, and he begins to burn. Just as he thinks he will die, the car tips into a creek and he survives, though badly burned. While recovering, the Burned Man becomes addicted to morphine and believes there is now a snake in his spine. Hatching a suicide plan, he gets to know a visitor named Marianne Engel, who is a sculptress suspected of having manic depression or schizophrenia. Humoring her at first as she believes she knew him several hundred years prior, they soon begin a friendship/ relationship, and he moves in with her. Throughout, Marianne reveals their ‚Äòpast‚Äô, and tells tales of love and hope, inspiring the Burned Man to live. Their ‚Äòpast‚Äô story begins in fourteenth-century Germany, at a monastery named Engelthal. A baby is found at the gates, and taken in and raised as a nun. The young sister Marianne is soon found to possess incredible language skills, understanding languages she has never been taught. One day, a man is brought to the monastery. He is severely burned, except for a small rectangle over his heart where there is an arrow wound, caused by a copy of Dante's Inferno, which he took from an Italian friend, blocking the burning arrow which struck him. The man is a member of a Condotta, a mercenary troop. The nuns believe the burned man is too injured to live. Marianne however looks after him, and he survives, and the two grow closer as she translates and reads to him Dante's Inferno. Finding love with each other, the Burned Man and Marianne flee the monastery and begin a new life together, getting married and conceiving a baby. One day while out shopping, they see the troop that the Burned Man was once a part of. If he is found alive, he will be put to death for being a deserter. Seeing an old friend of his, Brandeis, still with the Condotta, Marianne lures him back to their apartment where the two soldiers reunite like brothers. Brandeis too is eager to escape, so they hatch a plan. After a few months, Brandeis has escaped, and comes to live with Marianne and the Burned Man. But trouble follows as they are hunted down by the Condotta. Heavily pregnant, Marianne and the two men try to escape. Eventually they are caught. Brandeis is executed and the Burned Man is tied up and burned alive once more. In order to spare him pain, Marianne shoots an arrow through his heart, exactly through the first wound. However, the Condotta see her, and chase her over a frozen river. Falling through, Marianne encounters three ‚Äòpresences‚Äô, who claim they are now her three masters. As penance for the sins she had committed, she was told she now has a chest full of ‚Äòhearts‚Äô, that she must give away, which she does in the form of sculpting. She will have one heart left for her lover, who must ‚Äòaccept it, and then give it back‚Äô to set her free. As their love story unfolds past and present, Marianne also spins romantic tales from across the centuries and around the world that defy pain and suffering and bring hope and succor to her deeply damaged friend. Meanwhile, her own mental state begins to worsen, and she spends more time carving. When Marianne becomes aware of the narrator's continued morphine addiction she forces him to go cold turkey, during which he experiences a vivid hallucination in which he meets the protagonists of the stories Marianne has told him, and experiences their personal hell, all the while healing slowly until, ultimately, he looks exactly as he had before the car crash, and is told that he can choose to stay, maintaining his physical beauty, or jump off a cliff to be reunited with Marianne, which he does. Upon his awakening, Marianne resumes her carving, becoming more and more frenzied, neglecting to care for herself, the narrator, or her beloved dog, Bougatsa. After returning from hospital after an operation, the narrator discovers Marianne has carved his name into her chest, and has her committed to hospital to be treated for exhaustion. She returns and soon begins carving, but neither the narrator or Marianne's friend and agent, Jack, are able to convince her to stop nor have her legally committed for her own safety. They resign themselves, instead, to caring for her as she carves. Once she finishes the penultimate carving she reveals that her final carving isn't another gargoyle but a statue of the narrator, which he sits for and she carves at a much more leisurely pace. Once the statue is complete, Marianne and the narrator go to the beach at night, where she finishes the tale of their past love. She asks the narrator if he loves her and he confirms that he does, telling her that the car crash was the best thing that ever happened to him since it brought the two together. After this revelation, Marianne commits suicide by walking into the ocean while the narrator watches, understanding that while she would have come back had he asked, it would have meant her mission- as she saw it- was incomplete, since her last heart had never been returned to her. Due to the unusual circumstances of Marianne's death, the narrator initially comes under suspicion, but is soon cleared due to the testimonies of both Jack and witnesses at the beach. The narrator goes to a safety deposit box Marianne set up for him, in which he finds enough money to keep him going until she can be declared legally dead (due to the absence of a body) and two copies of The Inferno which seem to corroborate her claims; one is an early edition in the original Italian, singed around the edges and with a slit which seems to have been made by an arrow, while the other is a German edition which is later confirmed to both predate any known translation, but which holds the trademarks of an unknown scribe working at Engelthal monastery. The narrator takes up sculpting, and finds he has an unusual talent for it, but rather than carving statues he instead spends more time chipping away at the statue Marianne carved of him, resolving himself to asking a friend to kill him with a bow and arrow once his task is complete, thus reuniting with Marianne. Reception Janet Maslin of The New York Times reviewed the book, saying \\"So for all those who enter here, there is no need to abandon hope.

The rock art of the Djelfa region in the Ouled Na√Øl Range (Algeria) consists of prehistoric cave paintings and petroglyphs dating from the Neolithic age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the Saharan Atlas Mountains they follow on from those, to the west, of south Oran (the regions of Figuig, Ain Sefra, El Bayadh, Afalou and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable engravings have also been described further to the east, in the Constantine (Algeria) region.  Localities and descriptions  Some of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of Zaccar were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Da√Øet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesba√Øa and A√Øn Naga. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region. Henri Lhote referred to these engravings in his major work, Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais, which he published in 1970 in the series of the M√©moires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques pr√©historiques et ethnographiques (CRAPE).Edited at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri (Arts et M√©tiers graphiques, Paris, 210 pages and photographic reproductions). For him they could not \\"be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna\\"(p. 194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like \\"foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south Oran\\", (p. 193), a region which for the author was \\"the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions.\\" Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like \\"The Apollo of Ouled Na√Øl\\", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent. Regretting \\"the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art\\" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in Lybica (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on Les figurations rupestres de la r√©gion de Djelfa, Sud Alg√©rois. The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of Sidi Makhlouf and on the south- east by the town of Messaad. * The region of Djelfa on Wikimapia. left Around the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Da√Øet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons \\"Pigeon Rock\\"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesba√Øa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n¬∞ 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia). Around the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (A√Øn Mouilha), 5 (Da√Øet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan), 9 (Station de l'Autruche \\"Ostrich\\"), 8 (Da√Øet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (A√Øn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura). The engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, \\"stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the patina of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds.\\" They are \\"by-and-large arranged in little separate groups\\", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesba√Øa or A√Øn Naga being \\"exceptions\\". Recognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are \\"similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique\\", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif\\"(p. 67). According to these authors \\"The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with spheroids can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch\\" (p. 71). What is more \\"The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south Algerian.\\" Deducing that these evidences \\"show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient\\", Huard and Allard prefer to speak \\"of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep\\"(p. 71).  The \\"Hunters\\" Stage  Oued el Hesba√Øa. In the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient buffalo (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures. Of the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesba√Øa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), A√Øn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a \\"lengthened semi-circular attribute\\"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane. Large, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at A√Øn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, A√Øn Mouilha, Oued el Hesba√Øa (where the \\"elephant panel\\", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, Zaccar, Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin. Seven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, A√Øn Naga, and Oued el Hesba√Øa. Nine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Da√Øet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called the Tazina School, found in south-Oran. Eighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: \\"naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes\\" (Oued el Hesba√Øa, Zaccar, Da√Øet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), \\"fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile\\", \\"weaker in style and carving method\\", \\"late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes\\" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the \\"smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late\\", \\"of mediocre style and carving method\\"(pp. 81‚Äì85). The ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesba√Øa) \\"generally of a poor quality.\\" boars, in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir. The human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesba√Øa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, A√Øn Naga, Da√Øet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and Ben Hadid. Authors attribute to them the model of the \\"twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture\\" which they have identified \\"in the Nile area and in various Saharan regions\\" (p. 85). Thus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, \\"all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the spirale (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at Tassili in the Oued Djerat sector.\\"(p. 93).  Early stages of domestication  A√Øn Naga. Several antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching \\"through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication\\" (p. 97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures (A√Øn Naga, Da√Øet es Stel, Oued el Hesba√Øa, Saouiet). It is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of A√Øn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a loin-cloth with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the nape of his neck in three swathes. Of the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a ram, a ewe and a large bull denotes \\"a well established domestication\\" (p. 106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesba√Øa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and A√Øn Naga. The rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle (Zaccar) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others dating from the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb). The \\"pastoral scenes\\" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, A√Øn Mouilha (men with \\"bandes molleti√®res\\"), Morhoma, Da√Øet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, ithyphallic images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou, Mediouna II, and Da√Øet el Hamra. A√Øn Naga, engraving called \\"The timid lovers\\".At Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at A√Øn Naga that of the \\"timid lovers\\" in which the man carries an object like a haricot, shield or quiver surmounted by arrows, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at A√Øn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip. One also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various epochs. In addition, three sites with cave paintings are located at Djebel Doum, at the Zaccar south site (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma south. In 1968, elements of a lithic industry belonging to the Capsian were discovered in situ by D. Gr√©b√©nart at A√Øn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220. The probable ancient regional ecology North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a savanna type of ecosystem, with elephant, giraffe, and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the Sahel region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist Roland Oliver has described the scene as follows: > [In] the highlands of the central Sahara beyond the Libyan desert,... in the > great massifs of the Tibesti and the Hoggar, the mountaintops, today bare > rock, were covered at this period with forests of oak and walnut, lime, > alder and elm. The lower slopes, together with those of the supporting > bastions ‚Äî the Tassili and the Acacus to the north, Ennedi and Air to the > south ‚Äî carried olive, juniper and Aleppo pine. In the valleys, perennially > flowing rivers teemed with fish and were bordered by seed-bearing > grasslands.Oliver, Roland (1999), The African Experience: From Olduvai Gorge > to the 21st Century (Series: History of Civilization), London: Phoenix > Press, revised edition, pg 39.

By the mid-1860s, the company had started building locomotive boilers and other components; in 1872 the first locomotive followed, a narrow gauge engine for a rail gauge of 750 mm. As a result of shortages of space, Hagans often had to limit its operations. For example, the T 15 was built by Henschel because Hagans did not have the necessary capacity. In 1903 the factory site was moved to Ilversgehofen north of the city; only then was large-scale production possible. On 30 June 1915 the locomotive factory was sold, with effect from 1 April 1916, to the Maschinenbau R. Wolf Magdeburg-Buckau. In 1928, steam locomotive manufacture finally came to an end in Erfurt. By then Hagans had built 1,251 locomotives. The last Hagans engine was a DRG Class 64. Hagans locomotive A type of articulated steam locomotive is named after Hagans. It had two groups of coupled wheels that moved together and which were connected via swinging lever system (Schwinghebelsystem), so that the locomotive managed with one pair of cylinders.

He was one of the last of the old-style Camorra godfathers. Powerful Camorrista Originally from San Cipriano d'Aversa in the Italian province of Caserta, Bardellino was an important Cosa Nostra affiliate in the region of Campania. \\"Bardellino was the reference point of all Camorra clans, even the ones that could not stand him. With his charisma he managed to maintain a certain equilibrium in Campania\\", according to the pentito Pasquale Galasso. Audizione del collaboratore di giustizia Pasquale Galasso, Verbali della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia, presidenza Luciano Violante, July 13, 1993 He was the founder of the Casalesi clan, around which for almost a decade moved a united confederation of families (Schiavone, Bidognetti, Zagaria, Iovine, Venosa) rooted in a large territory which extended from southern Lazio through the agro aversano (countryside near Aversa), to Naples. Ties with Cosa Nostra Bardellino had close and powerful contacts within the Sicilian Mafia, initially with the Porta Nuova family of Pippo Cal√≤.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 135 He was one of the few Camorra bosses who were also initiated into Cosa Nostra. Together with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Michele Zaza, he was sworn in to seal a pact on cigarette smuggling in 1975.Sterling, Octopus, p. 269Behan, The Camorra, p. 51 In contrast to the Nuvoletta brothers, who were allied with the Corleonesi headed by Luciano Leggio and Salvatore Riina, Bardellino was allied with Rosario Riccobono, Stefano Bontade, Gaetano Badalamenti, and Tommaso Buscetta, all heads of fallen Palermo families which were defeated by the Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War and forced to flee. Underworld rackets It is believed that Bardellino was the initiator of the Casalesi clan in the area of Casal di Principe and San Cipriano d'Aversa, especially due to the transformation he implemented within the clan. The rituals of affiliation remained as well as the rate of murders, but the leap in quality was the continued infiltration of the legitimate economy with the proceeds of illicit drug trafficking. This was favoured by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the subsequent reconstruction, which prompted the families to create a consortium for their companies that performed the work of earth- moving and construction. Another factor was the great entrepreneurial ability of Bardellino himself. He owned an fish flour import-export business together with other clans, which in fact covered up a Brazilian cocaine smuggling operation. Besides trafficking cocaine, he was involved in the heroin trade with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Ciro Mazzarella, supplying the Sicilian Mafia.Jacquemet, Credibility in Court, p. 42 In the 1980s, Bardellino realized that cocaine, not heroin, would become the more profitable drug and organized a trafficking operation smuggling it from Latin America to Aversa via his front business. Heroin was smuggled as well, and shipments to the Gambino crime family were concealed inside espresso filters. When one shipment was intercepted by the authorities, Bardellino reportedly called John Gotti and told him; \\"Don't worry, now we're sending twice as much the other way\\".Saviano,Gomorrah, p. 189 Nuova Famiglia Bardellino was the main exponent of the Nuova Famiglia (NF), a confederation of clans that was formed to contrast the growing power of the predominant Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), led by Raffaele Cutolo. The NF consisted of Bardellino, Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with Cosa Nostra), the Gionta clan (from Torre Annunziata), the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, the Alfieri clan of Saviano led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino (led by Pasquale Galasso), the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella (led by Luigi Giuliano) and the Vollaro clan from Portici (led by Luigi Vollaro). Alfieri clan The resulting war between the NF and the NCO resulted in a large number of victims from both sides, and ended with the NCO's defeat and the victory of the NF. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated, with a war breaking out between the Bardellino and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983. War with the Nuvolettas While the Second Mafia War between the Corleonesi and the Bontade-Buscetta-Inzerillo- Badalamenti faction was being fought in Sicily, its effects were being felt on the Campanian underworld. The Corleonesi boss, Salvatore Riina, mandated Lorenzo Nuvoletta to order the murder of Tommaso Buscetta. Nuvoletta, in turn, passed the order to Bardellino. The order was not brought to an end, because Bardellino had been good friends with Buscetta in Sicily, and had once shared the same house with Buscetta in Brazil when the latter was absconding. He also deeply distrusted the Nuvolettas and was unwilling to accept the supremacy of the Nuvoletta brothers with the interference of the Corleonesi. Bardellino's attitude soon marked him for death, and he would spend the last years of life in hiding outside Italy, including Spain, Brazil and Santo Domingo. Towards the end of 1982, thanks to a tip off from the local police, Antonio Bardellino managed to evade capture in his Rio de Janeiro apartment. Despite this setback, a meeting was soon arranged between Bardellino and the Nuvolettas in Zurich, but Aniello Nuvoletta was arrested at the rendezvous. Many other leaders of the Nuvoletta clan would have been arrested had they not suffered a chance accident in northern Italy, near the Swiss border. Bardellino was arrested in Barcelona in Spain in November 1983, El italiano detenido en Barcelona, acusado de distribuir la droga latinoamericana en Europa, El Pa√≠s, November 4, 1983 but he was inexplicably released on bail and disappeared soon afterwards.Behan, The Camorra, p. 91 El 'caso Bardellino', El Pa√≠s, January 12, 1988 Victory The clash with the Nuvoletta clan resulted in Bardellino's victory. An attack was made at the Nuvoletta family's farm in Marano which resulted in the death of Ciro Nuvoletta, one of the brothers. Two months later, events culminated with an attack at Torre Annunziata, an area infamous for its illegal activities, which led to the massacre of eight members of the Gionta clan allied with the Nuvolettas at the Circolo dei Pescatori (fisherman's club). Another twenty four were wounded. This episode was known as the Torre Annunziata massacre in the local press, and is perhaps the worst gangland massacre to ever take place in Italy. This victory further allowed Antonio Bardellino to expand his sphere of control and influence to include almost the entire province of Caserta and Naples. In spite of being a fugitive sought by Interpol, Bardellino could exercise his power and coordinate criminal activities unhindered, but the disagreements came with the Casalesi itself. Assassination According to the official version of the story, on May 26, 1988, Antonio Bardellino was murdered by his right-hand man, Mario Iovine in his Brazilian home at B√∫zios, a beach side resort for the rich and famous in the State of Rio de Janeiro, as part of an internal feud within the Casalesi. Dopo un anno la conferma 'Bardellino e' stato ucciso', La Repubblica, July 25, 1989 However, this story has never been verified because his body was never found and the alleged assassin, Iovine, was himself murdered in Portugal in 1991 while using a phone booth. These circumstances have fuelled a legend that Bardellino is still alive, La grande beffa, Bardellino e' vivo..., La Repubblica, June 22, 1988 and has left power in the hands of the other families within the Casalesi clan in order to ensure the survival of his family. When his old friend, Tommaso Buscetta who later became a pentito was asked about the status of Bardellino during a testimony before the Antimafia Commission, he replied: \\"Is it already obvious that Bardellino died? I do not know, but I do not believe that he is dead.\\" Audizione del collaboratore della giustizia Tommaso Buscetta, Verbali della Commissione Parlamentare Antimafia, presidenza Luciano Violante, November 16, 1992 After the news of Bardellino's death spread, his family left their homes and native areas to take refuge in Formia where they still reside. After the disappearance of Antonio Bardellino, the five families (Schiavone, Iovine, Bidognetti, De Falco and Zagaria) took control, each with their own army.The Casalasi clan of the Camorra His former ally Umberto Ammaturo, who turned state witness (pentito), also said Bardellino was still alive when he gave a rare interview to La Repubblica newspaper in May 2010. \\"Tagliai io la testa a Semerari; aveva tradito un nostro accordo\\", La Repubblica, May 25, 2010 See also *List of people who disappeared Notes References * L‚Äôatteggiarsi delle associazioni mafiose sulla base delle esperienze processuali acquisite: la Camorra, Luigi Gay, Sostituto procuratore della Repubblica presso il Tribunale di Napoli *Behan, Tom (1996).

Deciding to make this his profession, he left Paris in secret for Brussels to study under D'Hannetaire, then at the peak of his reputation.

It was located in what is now a rectangle between 6 rue des Fontaines du Temple (where there are the remains of one of its walls), rue Volta and rue du Vertbois, and part of its site is now occupied by the lyc√©e Turgot. As the Madelonnettes Prison (prison des Madelonnettes) during the French Revolution, its prisoners included the writers the Marquis de Sade and Nicolas Chamfort, the politician Jean-Baptiste de Machault d'Arnouville and the actor Dazincourt. Convent Origins The Convent on Jacques Gomboust's 1652 map of Paris Its origins date back to 1618, when the wine merchant Robert de Montry - after being rebuffed by the local prostitutes in his attempts to reform them - finally decided to put them back to the right path whilst being accommodated in his own home. With the aid of M. Du Pont (cur√© of Saint-Nicolas des Champs), the Capuchin Father Athanase Mol√© and M. de Fresne (an officer of the Gardes du Corps du Roi and a friend of Saint Vincent de Paul among others), Montry worked to spread his charitable work to other prostitutes. Quickly overtaken by their success, at first they rented rooms in the faubourg Saint-Honor√©, before Robert de Montry lent them a house he owned in the quartier de la Croix-Rouge. A chapel for the house was improvised, served by Benedictines from Saint-Germain des Pr√©s. The idea of creating an actual convent was down to the patronage of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and the generosity of the Marquise de Maignelay (n√©e Claude-Marguerite de Gondi, sister of Jean-Fran√ßois de Gondi, archbishop of Paris), who, on 16 July 1620, acquired from sister Dubuisson a property in rue des Fontaines, between the Abbaye Saint-Martin des Champs and the Temple fortress enclosure, and left them 101,600 livres in her will. In 1625, Louis XIII granted them 3,000 livres in rents, and they were accorded a constitution by pope Urban VIII in 1630]. Most of the buildings were constructed in 1637, with the first chapel inaugurated by Anne of Austria on 22 March 1648 and a church built from 1680 onwards and consecrated on 2 September 1685. History The site today This large gathering of \\"sinners\\" freely choosing the way of redemption slowly evolved into a more classical convent establishment in which women or girls suspected of misconduct would be confined on the orders of the king, judges or even just at their family's request, the most famous example being the courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos, imprisoned there in 1657 at the request of Anne of Austria, now queen-mother (though according to G√©d√©on Tallemant des R√©aux, Ninon did not remain there long, so strong was the pressure of her gallants that gathered around the convent to demand her release). A number of them came from rich families who provided the convent with a large pension. It was thus necessary therefore to strengthen the supervision, which was confided in turn to four sisters of the Visitation of Saint-Antoine (1629‚Äì1677), the Ursulines (1677‚Äì1720) and finally to the nuns of Saint-Michel (1720 onwards), renowned for their severity. The convent at its peak housed 165 pensionnaires, organized in three orders, each with a separate building: * the actual sisters of Sainte Madeleine, after taking their solemn vows, white habit; * the sisters of Saint' Marthe, after taking their basic vows, grey habit - these could move up to the order of Sainte Madeleine after two years in the novitiate ; * the sisters of Saint Lazare, who had taken no vows and were generally held here against their will, in secular dress but with their face concealed by a black taffeta veil. Prison French Revolution After the decree of the National Assembly of 13 February 1790 abolishing convents, a last inventory of the convent's goods and income was carried out on 17 March that same year. Though the convent officially closed in 1790, the nuns were only dispersed by stages, since a new mother-superior and bursar were named on 21 March 1791. In the face of a new wave of imprisonments, in 1793 the convent buildings were converted into a prison for political prisoners and common criminals, with its first prisoners arriving on 4 April under the direction of the commissaire Marino and the concierge Vaubertrand. The tempo of arrests quickened from May 1793 (up to 47 a day) and this led to overcrowding, with a prison only originally meant for 200 people housing up to 319 by 27 Messidor, crammed into cells only each. Common criminals, nicknamed \\"les pailleux\\", were held on the ground floor, with people of varying origins referred to as \\"suspects\\". Despite the crowded conditions, the mood was good, with improvised poems, singing, music-making and gymnastics, all under the jailors' eyes, but despite this, the prison regime was hard and insanitary. Commissaire Marino forbade prisoners to go into the courtyard, under the pretext that their detention was only provisional whilst they were awaiting transfer to another location. Promiscuity favoured the spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox, which claimed several victims. At the end of December 1793, the political prisoners were moved to (among others) the Port-Libre, Picpus, and Saint-Lazare prisons, and the common criminals were sent to Bic√™tre. Little by little the Madelonnettes was emptied of prisoners after the events of Thermidor, and it reopened in 1795 as a women's prison for female criminals and debtors and young women shut up for correction by their fathers (as an annex to the prison Saint Lazare). An image of the prison can be seen in a painting by Louis L√©opold Boilly now at the Mus√©e Carnavalet. 19th century The prison remained a women's prison until April 1831, and also had the population of other prisons transferred to it, such as the public daughters of the Petite Force (1828) and the prisoners at the Prison Sainte- P√©lagie (1831). Finally all the prisoners from La Roquette Prisons were transferred to the Madelonnettes in 1836 and it became a maison d'arr√™t for men on their way to La Force. In the wake of the 1848 Revolution large numbers of politicians were imprisoned here, and in 1865-1866 the Madelonnettes was finally demolished by Haussmann to build the rue de Turbigo (in works which were photographed by Charles Marville) and replaced by the still existing Prison de la Sant√©. Famous prisoners Among the \\"suspects\\" held here were : * 13 actors (the actresses were imprisoned at Sainte P√©lagie) of the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais who remained faithful to the monarchy, arrested on the night of 2 September 1793 following the production of \\"Pamela\\", a play by Nicolas- Louis Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau which was judged to be seditious.

It uses an idiosyncratic method of historical genealogy derived from, among others, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Georges Bataille, and Michel Foucault, to show how the development of sanitation techniques in Western Europe affected the formation of modern notions of individuality. Laporte examines this influence through the historical processes of urbanization, the apotheosis of nationalism, practices of capitalist exchange, and linguistic reform.  Translation  In the English translation of the book by Nadia Benabid and Rodolphe el-Khoury in 1993, el-Khoury explains how for Laporte, \\"the history of shit becomes the history of subjectivity\\" and how his book becomes \\"a prehistory to modernity and the modern subject\\" (viii)Laporte, Dominique, HISTORY OF shit , trans. Nadia Benabid and Rodolphe el-Khoury, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 2000 El-Khoury identifies in the introduction of the book Laporte's scholarly strategy of joining the ridiculous and the profound as inherently political. Laporte's stated ambition is to \\"remove a few masks with the roar of our laughter, laugh them off the figures of power\\" (ix). The critic added these words to his ideas about the book: ‚ÄúAccording to Freud, the decline of the olfactory sense was an inevitable outgrowth of the civilizing process, set in motion when man adopted an erect posture. From that point, he argues, ‚Äúthe chain of events would have proceeded through the devaluation of the olfactory stimuli and the isolation of the menstrual period to the time when visual stimuli were paramount and the genitals became visible and thence to the continuity of sexual excitation, the founding of the family and so to the threshold of civilization.‚ÄùLaporte‚Äôs History of Shit is consistent with Freud‚Äôs general outline insofar as it recognizes the decline of the olfactory, exploits the tensions between the private nose and the public eye, and situates a historical turning point at the founding of the family.‚Äù  See also  * French writers * Psychoanalysts * Schools of psychoanalysis References 1978 non-fiction books Books about feces ","title":"History of Shit"},{"id":"19133944","text":"Colonel Henry Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell circa 1862 Colonel Henry Blundell- Hollinshead Blundell (24 January 1831 ‚Äì 28 September 1906) was a British army officer and Conservative politician.

However, he preferred to return to Brussels, in Durancy's troupe, in which he was entrusted \\"les r√¥les √† manteaux\\" and \\"les r√¥les de Crispin\\". In 1755 he took over from Durancy as head of this troupe, and stayed so until 1771, sometimes alone, sometimes in association with other actors. D'Hannetaire and his wife had 8 children, 2 of whom also became notable actors : * Eug√©nie (1746‚Äì1816), married the comic- actor Larive, it was to her that the prince de Ligne dedicated his Lettres √† Eug√©nie sur les spectacles (1774) * Ang√©lique (1749‚Äì1822), mistress of vicomte Desandrouins, then of the same prince de Ligne. In 1768, he renounced acting to become a notary, in the historic context of the excommunication of actors \\"in virtue of an old usage of comedy\\". Nevertheless, he continued to act at Brussels for several years, before having to retire until his death in Brussels.

Variations, especially the Sympathetic Coins also known as Coins-n-Cards, have been performed since the 1800s. Popular modern variations are Shadow Coins and Matrix. A variation using playing cards as the objects is known as Sympathetic Aces. Effect In the typical layout, the magician places four small objects on a table in a square, rectangular or diamond formation (although even a single straight line formation is possible). The objects are usually equidistant from each other. The magician then covers any two of the objects with his hands, performs a flourish, and then lifts his hands to reveal that one of the objects has somehow jumped from its original location to join one of the other three objects. The same effect is repeated until all of the objects are gathered together in a single location. Objects most commonly used for the trick are wine corks, dice, bottle caps, brass weights, and coins. A version using coins that are covered by cards is a variation on the same concept known as \\"Matrix\\", credited to the magician Al Schneider. History Sean McWeeney, the author of the first dedicated e-book on chink-a-chink, has demonstrated that the trick is a lot older than was previously thought, with a history stretching back to at least early/mid-19th-century Germany. The trick was famously covered in Edwin Sach's seminal book Sleight of Hand in 1877, utilizing four sugar cubes.Edwin Sachs, \\"Sleight of Hand\\", Courier Corporation, 1885, pp. 40-42. Yank Hoe is reputed to have performed it as early as 1891, and introduced the name \\"Sympathetic Coins\\".Thomas Nelson Downs, \\"The Art of Magic\\", pp. 251-255. Max Malini, who popularized the trick in the early 20th century, using cut-down wine corks, is generally credited with naming the trick. Although the name was probably meant to be onomatopoetic, it can be interpreted as a racial slur and as a result, has been given alternative names. Leo Horowitz perpetuated Malini's version while adding refinements of his own, using covered sugar cubes of a type popular in supper clubs and night spots in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Doug Henning performed chink-a-chink on television in the early 1970s, using seashells. Dutch magicians Fred Kaps and Tommy Wonder were also associated with the trick. A variation using cards was developed by Al Schneider in 1960. Fellow magician Karrell Fox suggested calling the trick \\"Al-ternating Coins\\", however Schneider decided on \\"Matrix\\" due to his math background. It was published with this name in November 1970 in Genii magazine. Close-up magician, Ryan Hayashi, created another version of he calls \\"Ultimate Matrix\\" in which part of the trick is performed with one hand. Pre-fabricated chink-a-chink sets are available on order from various magic-makers, including Auke van Dokkum of the Netherlands, Fran√ßois Danis of France and Jim Riser of the US. Professional magicians, however, generally prefer the traditional \\"found objects\\" (such as corks and bottle caps) to the artificial ones, reducing demand for the purpose-built sets. Description Chink-a-chink involves sleight of hand along with one extra object of whatever sort is being used. To start the trick, four of the objects are arranged on the table while the fifth is palmed. The magician places his hands over two of the objects on the table and performs some flourish to cover movement. During the flourish, the previously- palmed fifth object is dropped, while the object under the empty hand is palmed. This leaves the newly palmed object in the opposite hand of the original. The magician then switches his hands so the other hand, with the newly lifted object, is held over the pile, and the process is repeated. Sachs' gives a complete list of suggested moves to achieve this alternating motion. When the pile is completely constructed, one object is still in the magician's hand, which is then pocketed or simply dropped in his lap.Edwin Sachs, \\"Sleight of Hand\\", Courier Corporation, 1885, pp. 40-42. The Matrix variations on the basic trick use playing cards to cover the coins instead of the magician's hands. The trick is otherwise identical, although in some cases there is no fifth coin, and instead one of the coins is picked up during what appears to be a pre-trick explanation. The location of the missing coin is covered by dropping the other card on that location and leaving it there. A handkerchief is sometimes used to provide a temporary holding area for the extra coin. Alternation takes place by handing the playing card from hand to hand between drops, or alternating hands to lift the card covering the growing pile. Sympathetic Aces is a variation using four cards, the aces, in place of coins.Jean Hugard and Frederick Braue, \\"Expert Card Technique\\", Courier Corporation, 1974, p. 242.

Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart, New York: Penguin (Berkley/Putnam). The infant lived for only six hours. At a press conference afterwards, Kantrowitz emphasized that he considered the operation to have been a failure. Kantrowitz also invented the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), a left ventricular assist device (L-VAD), and an early version of the implantable pacemaker. In 1981, Kantrowitz became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Early life and education Kantrowitz was born in New York City on October 4, 1918. His mother was a costume designer and his father ran a clinic in the Bronx. Adrian told his mother as a three-year-old that he wanted to be a doctor, and as a child built an electrocardiograph from old radio parts, together with his brother Arthur. He graduated from New York University in 1940, having majored in mathematics. He attended the Long Island College of Medicine (now SUNY Downstate Medical Center) and was awarded his medical degree in 1943 as part of an effort to accelerate the availability of physicians during World War II. During an internship at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, he developed an interest in neurosurgery, and had a paper published in 1944, \\"A Method of Holding Galea Hemostats in Craniotomies\\", in which he proposed a new type of clamp to be used while performing a craniotomy during brain surgery. Early career He served for two years as a battalion surgeon in the United States Army Medical Corps and was discharged from the Army in 1946 with the rank of major. After his military service, he switched to specialize in cardiac surgery due to the paucity of positions in neurosurgery. In 1947, he was an Assistant Resident in Surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Montefiore Hospital He was on the surgical staff of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx from 1948 until 1955. He started at Montefiore as Assistant Resident in Surgery and Pathology, and progressed to Cardiovascular Research Fellow before becoming Chief Resident in Surgery. At the New York Academy of Medicine, on October 16, 1951, he screened the world's first movies taken inside a living heart, showing the sequential opening and closing of the mitral valve inside a beating heart. Using dogs and other animals as experimental subjects, Kantrowitz developed an artificial left heart, an early version of an oxygen generator for use as a component in a heart-lung machine and a treatment for coronary artery disease in which blood vessels would be rearranged during surgery.Finding Aid to the Adrian Kantrowitz Papers, 1944-2004 , United States National Library of Medicine. Accessed November 19, 2008. He also developed a device that allowed individuals who were paralyzed to have their bladders empty through a signal sent from a radio-controlled device. Maimonides Medical Center and early work on Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) From 1955 to 1970, he held surgical posts at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. In February 1958, a heart-lung machine Kantrowitz had developed was used during open heart surgery on a six-year-old boy while the surgeons repaired a one-inch hole between the chambers of the boy's heart that was present since birth. In an October 1959 lecture at the American College of Surgeons, Kantrowitz and colleague Dr. William M. P. McKinnon reported on a procedure in which a portion of muscle from the diaphragm was used to create a \\"booster\\" heart to help pump blood in a dog, taking over as much as 25% of the pumping burden of the natural heart. The booster heart functions by receiving a signal sent by a radio transmitter triggered by the pulse of the natural heart. Kantrowitz noted that the procedure was not ready to be performed on humans. Ruff, a \\"friendly dog of unknown ancestry\\" was honored by the New York Academy of Sciences as \\"research dog of the year\\" for his unwitting participation in the implantation of a booster heart 18 months earlier in a procedure performed by Kantrowitz. In the early 1960s, Kantrowitz developed an implantable artificial pacemaker together with General Electric. The first of these pacemakers was implanted in May 1961. The device included an external control unit that could adjust the pacing rate from 64 to 120 beats per minute to allow the patient to deal with physical or emotional stress.Kirk, Jeffrey. \\"Machines in Our Hearts: The Cardiac Pacemaker, the Implantable Defibrillator, and American Health Care\\", via Google Books. JHU Press, 2001. . Accessed November 19, 2008. Throughout the 1960s, he collaborated with a team that included his brother, engineer Arthur Kantrowitz, on the development of a left ventricular assist device. Building on his experiments with dogs, he performed the world's second permanent partial mechanical heart implantation in a human on February 4, 1966, which was successful, though the patient died 24 hours after surgery as a result of preexisting liver disease. His second implant of a partial mechanical heart on a 63-year-old woman, on May 18, 1966, lasted 13 days, until the patient died of a stroke. During these almost two weeks after the surgery, the patient was improving, and was able to sit up and eat well. This surgery used a valveless device developed with his brother Arthur in which the natural electrical impulses of the patient's heart controlled the action of the pump.Staff. \\"An Implanted Half Heart\\", Time (magazine), June 3, 1966. Accessed November 19, 2008. As part of Kantrowitz's research for this project, he conceived of ABO- incompatible heart transplantation, though it would be three decades before it would be put into practice.Klein, A. A., Lewis, C. J., & Madsen, J. C. (2011). Organ Transplantation: A Clinical Guide. p.116. Cambridge University Press. Worldwide context of heart transplantation Dr. James Hardy had performed the world's first heart transplant attempt and first heart xenograft at the University of Mississippi Medical Center on Jan. 24, 1964. Since there was no standard of brain death, Hardy had acquired four chimpanzees as potential back-up donors. A comatose Boyd Rush with a faint pulse had been brought to the hospital several days earlier and when he went into shock and was taken into surgery, Hardy polled the fellow doctors on his team, with three voting yes and one abstaining. Hardy and his team then proceeded with the transplant using a chimpanzee heart which beat in Rush's chest approximately 60 to 90 minutes (sources vary), and Rush died without regaining consciousness. The hospital's public relations department put out a guarded statement, with many of the early newspaper articles making the assumption that the donor was a human. In addition, when Hardy attended the Sixth International Transplantation Conference several weeks later, he was treated with \\"icy disdain.\\" Hardy withdrew from active pursuit of a successful heart transplant.Every Second Counts, McRae, in Ch. 7 \\"Mississippi Gambling,\\" pertaining to Hardy's 1964 xenograft transplant, pages bottom 122 through 127.Heart Transplantation in Man: Developmental Studies and Report of a Case, JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), James D.

In what turned out to be a four-way race between South African cardiac surgeon Dr. Christiaan Barnard and Americans Norman Shumway and Richard Lower, Kantrowitz prepared for a potential human heart transplant by transplanting hearts in 411 dogs over a five-year period together with members of his surgical team. On June 29, 1966, by which time Kantrowitz had completed the necessary technical research, one of his patients was an 18-day-old infant who very much needed a new heart. He and his team had located an anecephalic baby whose parents agreed to let her be the donor. Due to disagreements with senior staffers Howard Joos and Harry Weiss, Kantrowitz was forced to wait until cardiac death (instead of the more modern use of brain death) to retrieve the donor heart, which was found to be useless. According to the Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart (2006), Kantrowitz did not know at the time that the donor parents in Oregon both expected and wanted their baby's heart to be taken before it stopped beating (anecephalic babies typically live 24 to 48 hours).Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart, Donald McRae, Penguin Books, 2006, pages 140-54.

Kantrowitz's 1967 pediatric heart transplant attempt at Maimonides On December 6, 1967, at Maimonides Medical Center, Kantrowitz's team, including Bj√∏rnstad PG, Lindberg HL, Smevik B, Rian R, S√∏rland SJ, Tj√∏nneland S, performed the world's first pediatric heart transplant attempt as well as the first human-to-human heart transplant in the United States. The donor infant was David McIntire Bashaw who was anencephalic baby with a brain which was \\"grossly malformed\\" and who had a poor moro reflex (infant's startle response). However, this infant could move its extremities and had a feeble cry. According to Every Second Counts, both this infant and the recipient infant had their body temperatures cooled from 98.6 to 59 ¬∞F, at which time surgeons then waited for the donor baby's heart to stop beating.Every Second Counts, McRae, in Chapter 12 \\"The Man with the Golden Hands,\\" pages 215 to 220. The recipient infant was 19-day-old Jamie Scudero who had the heart conditions of tricuspid atresia and Ebstein's anomaly.Every Second Counts, McRae, 2006, page 179 \\"Ebstein's anomaly, which results in a severe malformation of the tricuspid valve and causes catastrophic damage to the right ventricle, ruined the baby's heart. . . \\" At 3:45 a.m., the cooling procedure began. At 4:25 a.m., the Bashaw baby flat-lined, and Jordan Haller removed his heart. He and Kantrowitz sutured the heart into Scudero's chest. This took 40 minutes. Kantrowitz was relying on hypothermia alone for Scudero which meant the entire operation needed to be completed in less than an hour. The team then warmed Scudero to 79 ¬∞F, at which point they administered an electrical shock to the heart and it began to beat. Scudero lived for a little more than six hours, and then his new heart stopped beating and could not be restarted.Staff. \\"The Ultimate Operation\\", Time (magazine), December 15, 1967.

Alex Faltine was the head technician and was responsible for re-warming Scudero. During the procedure, a connector between two hot water pipes came loose. Faltine simply held it in place with his thinly-gloved hands and didn't say anything to slow down the operation. Afterwards, Haller was astonished to see his blistered hands and asked Faltine how long he had had to hold the pipes together. Faltine, a man in his fifties who occasionally showed off by doing one-armed push-ups in the hallway, simply shrugged it off.Every Second Counts, McRae, 2006, pages 218 and 219. Pump to assist heart The intra-aortic balloon pump was invented by Kantrowitz, working in conjunction with his brother, Arthur Kantrowitz. Inserted through the patient's thigh, it was directed into the aorta, and alternately expanded and contracted in order to reduce strain on the heart. Based on Kantrowitz's theory of \\"counterpulsation\\", the device inflated the balloon with helium gas when the heart relaxed and deflated it when the heart pumped blood. The pump did not require surgery and could be inserted using local anesthetic in an emergency room or at a patient's bedside. The device was first used in August 1967 to save the life of a 45-year-old woman who was having a heart attack. The device could be used in the 15% of heart attack patients who went into severe shock, 80% of whom could not be helped by the protocols that existed before the balloon pump. Since the device went into widespread use in the 1980s, it had been used in some three million patients by the time of his death. Sinai Hospital He and his entire team of surgeons, researchers, biomedical engineers, and nurses relocated to Sinai Hospital (now Sinai-Grace Hospital) in Detroit in 1970, where he assumed the position of attending surgeon and Chairman of the Department of Surgery. At Sinai Hospital, Kantrowitz experimented further with heart transplants and continued development of the balloon pump, and partial mechanical hearts. In August 1971, he implanted an artificial heart booster in a 63-year-old man whose weakened heart could not pump sufficient oxygenated blood to his body.Staff. \\"Assist for an Ailing Heart\\", Time (magazine), August 23, 1971.

Personal life, heart failure, and death Kantrowitz married Jean Rosensaft on November 25, 1948. His wife was an administrator on the surgical research laboratories at Maimonides Medical Center while he was there.

It is also a civil parish in the Selby District. Historically the village is part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Geography Kirk Smeaton and its sister village Little Smeaton face each other across the River Went, the most southerly boundary of the Celtic Kingdom of Elmet. A footbridge links the two, providing both villages with walks to Brockadale Nature Reserve and Wentbridge. The Doncaster / North Yorkshire boundary lies close to the south of the village, and to the east it begins to follow the River Went all the way to the River Don. A railway from the Leeds - Doncaster line past Drax Power Station used to run close to the south of the village, with a railway station that opened in 1885 and part of the Hull and Barnsley Railway. The station was closed to passengers in 1932, and closed completely in 1959. Etymology The name Smeaton is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the form Smedetone. This derives from Old English words smi√æ (in its genitive plural form smi√æa) and t≈´n ('farm, estate'), and thus once meant 'smiths' farm'. The kirk element of the name is first attested in 1311 and is a northern English dialect word for 'church', coming from the Old Norse word for 'church', kirkja. This element was added to the name to distinguish the settlement from nearby Little Smeaton.A. H. Smith, The Place- Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Name Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), part 2, p. 51. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book (along with Little Smeaton), with the land being tenanted by Ilbert of Lacey. In 1840 Earl Fitzwilliam donated land for the foundation of Kirk Smeaton CE J&I; Primary School. It is a small school which is well regarded. A pre-school meet onsite in term-time, and there is a breakfast club and after-school club. The school has a mixture of new and old buildings, a sports hall and a community room which can be hired out. It is a Church school, and there are good links with the community and Church. The village pub is the Shoulder of Mutton on Main Street. Black Sheep Ale is usually served, amongst others. A harvest auction at the pub raises money for charity. There is a village post office. In the 2001 Census, the population was 344, which had risen to 405 by the 2011 Census. In 2015, North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population to be at 390.

It was founded by Penghulu Said bin Jaafar bin Enjang (1860‚Äì1960) circa 1900, when he opened up an early settlement on the Kedah side of the border.  Origin of name Kuala is essentially an estuary where a river meets the sea. According to Penghulu Said, the origin of the word Sanglang is Sarang Helang, which means \\"eagle nest\\". These nests ware said to be found along the coast and estuary of the area. Thus Kuala Sarang Helang is the original name, before later becoming Sanglang. Penghulu Said Penghulu Said was a punghulu (a sort of village or county chief) of Mukim Sanglang in 1900 until the Japanese occupation of Malaya. In Kampung Masjid, where the descendants of his followers settled, he donated two pieces of land; one for the mosque and the other for a Muslim cemetery. The rest of the land was used for housing. Penghulu Said's grandfather Enjang was probably from Perak as the name Enjang signifies a Perakian origin. While Jaafar was a seaman in Penang who later migrated to Kampung Sanglang where he got married and had 6 children. Penghulu Said was the eldest among his siblings, and he was later appointed as Panglima(a bodyguard and head of the local militia) to the Penghulu before being appointed as Penghulu himself, under the Sultan of Kedah. His military service was fighting in Penang during the War of Che Nyoya and arresting the infamous bandit Salleh Tui in Kampung Sanglang. His nephews who became Penghulu and Panglima were Penghulu Saari and Panglima Chin.  Economy The main economic activity in Kuala Sanglang is fishing. However, in the past, when the sea and rivers were the primary means of transportation, Kuala Sanglang played a major role as a port as well as a trade centre. With the hinterland planted with rice, rice processing too become an important industry. With the development of roads, Kuala Sanglang declined as a port and transport centre, but the recent activity of rearing prawns has become an important industry besides traditional fishing.

Early life Johann Theodor was a son of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria and of his wife Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska (daughter of King John III Sobieski of Poland). He was educated at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria and at the University of Siena.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Johann Theodor Ecclesiastical career Johann Theodor was elected bishop of Regensburg by its cathedral chapter on 29 July 1719, at age 15. The election received papal confirmation 14 October 1721. He was elected coadjutor bishop of Freising by its cathedral chapter on 5 November 1723. The election received papal confirmation on 12 April 1726, and he was permitted to retain the see of Regensburg. Johann Theodor was ordained subdeacon in 1724. He was ordained priest on 8 April 1730. After receiving a papal dispensation on 4 August 1730 to receive episcopal consecration before the canonically required age (he was only 27 years old), he was consecrated bishop on 1 October 1730, in the cathedral of M√ºnster, by his brother Clemens August of Bavaria, Archbishop and Elector of Cologne, assisted by Johann Adolf von Horde, titular bishop of Flaviopoli, and by Ferdinand Oesterhof, titular bishop of Agatonice. Johann Theodor playing the cello at Li√®ge On 9 September 1743 Johann Theodor was created a Cardinal-Priest by Pope Benedict XIV, but his name was reserved in pectore and was not announced until 17 January 1746. On 27 April 1746 he received the cardinalatial title of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. On 23 January 1744 Johann Theodor was elected Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge by the cathedral chapter. The election received papal confirmation 12 February 1744, and he was permitted to retain the sees of Regensburg and Freising. Johann Theodor did not participate in the conclave of 1758 following the death of Pope Benedict XIV. He was the last representative of the Wittelsbach family to occupy the bishopric of Li√®ge. In March 1761, shortly after the death of his elder brother Clemens August, Pope Clement XIII rejected his succession as Archbishop and Elector of Cologne because the pope entertained some doubt as to Johann Theodor's moral conduct. Johann Theodor was known as a great hunter, patron of music (he played the violoncello) and theatre, and held a splendid court at Li√®ge. He was said to have had affairs with several women despite his clerical status and was liked by the inhabitants of the bishopric. Asthmatic and tubercular, he gave into the advice of his doctor, a physician named Steppler (a German from Munich), who claimed that his sickness originated from coal vapours. He thus went for regular stays in Germany, though this did not improve his health. Death Johann Theodor died on 27 January 1763, in Li√®ge, Belgium. He was buried in Saint-Lambert Cathedral in Li√®ge while his heart was placed in the Chapel of Grace in the Shrine of Our Lady of Alt√∂tting.  References  Sources *A.

The soda was produced at the company's plant in College Point, Queens, New York. (Requires scrolldown) Initially it came only in ginger ale, sweetened with sodium cyclamate. Later, root beer and black cherry were added, the latter becoming the flagship flavor. Eventually they added Lemon, cola, coffee, and chocolate sodas. Eventually, the company started marketing the soda to \\"weight-conscious\\" housewives. It thus took off in popularity, until the company was worth millions. Ray Distributors, owned and operated by Arthur Raphael, was the sole distributor of No-Cal soda on Long Islang from the early 1950s till his death in 1967. Mr. Raphael, a salesman for Kirsch before Hyman and Morris Kirsch gave him the opportunity to bring No-Cal to Nassau and Suffolk Counties, was also instrumental in introducing No-Cal as a fountain drink.

She is the oldest daughter and second of five children of Todd and Sarah Palin. Palin competed in the fall 2010 season of Dancing with the Stars and reached the finals, finishing in third place. In summer 2011, Palin released a memoir, Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far. In summer 2012, she starred in the Lifetime show Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp. Her most recent television series was as a member of the fall celebrity cast of Dancing with the Starss 15th season in 2012, where she was eliminated in the fourth week of competition. Early life Palin was born on October 18, 1990, in Wasilla, Alaska, to parents Todd and Sarah (n√©e Heath) Palin. She was named \\"Bristol\\" for the Bristol Inn where her mother Sarah was employed; Bristol, Connecticut, the headquarters city of ESPN, where her mother Sarah hoped to work as a sportscaster; and the Bristol Bay area of Alaska, where her father Todd grew up. Her mother, Sarah, is of English, Irish, and German ancestry. Her father, Todd, has Yup'ik (from a great-grandmother), Dutch, and English ancestry. Bristol is a Native American as a lineal descendant of her father Todd, who is a native enrollee under the 1970 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, making her a member of the Yup'ik tribe. Palin was raised largely in Wasilla and attended Juneau-Douglas High School when her mother was governor of Alaska. During 2008, she briefly lived in Anchorage with her aunt and uncle where she attended West Anchorage High School. After returning to Wasilla, she attended and then graduated from Wasilla High School in May 2009. Career Candie's Foundation Palin first became the subject of media attention when her pregnancy was announced during her mother's unsuccessful run for vice president. In February 2009, she told Fox News that abstinence is \\"not realistic at all,\\" but that she would like it to become more accepted among people her age. At age 18 in May 2009, Palin appeared on the Today show and Good Morning America in recognition of the National Day to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. She called for all teens to abstain from sex. Such observance was started by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Palin was not employed by the Campaign, nor was she a spokesperson for the organization. Palin said that her abstinence quote of February had been \\"taken out of context\\". Also in May 2009, Palin was named a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Ambassador for the Candie's Foundation, a teen pregnancy prevention organization that is a division of the Candie's clothing brand. Her duties as a paid spokeswoman involved attending town hall meetings, talking about abstinence, public service announcements, and giving interviews on morning talk shows. In September 2009, Palin formed BSMP, a lobbying, public relations and political consulting services firm.Original documentation from State of Alaska: Articles of Organization LLC, page 1; page 1 continued; page 2 While the initial focus was to be work with Candie's Foundation, BSMP was planned to develop additional clients. In May 2009, on Good Morning America, Palin said, \\"Regardless of what I did personally, abstinence is the only 100% foolproof way you can prevent pregnancy.\\" In an interview on Good Morning America in April 2010, she said that \\"'Pause Before You Play' [a campaign of Candie's] hits a wider range of message, it can mean pause and go get a condom, it can be pause and think about your life, or it could be pause and wait until marriage.\\" Her role as a spokesperson drew some public criticism. Bonnie Fuller, former editor-in-chief of YM, questioned whether the net effect of Palin's public speaking had glamorized rather than discouraged teen pregnancy, noting that the \\"picture perfect\\" imagery of a People magazine spread seemed to make her \\"the poster girl for teen momhood\\". That same month, Meghan McCain stated her support for sex education, criticizing Palin's sexual abstinence campaign, saying it was \\"not realistic for this generation\\". In April 2011 the media reported that Palin was paid more than $262,000 by Candie's Foundation for her work in 2009. This level of compensation, which constituted 12% of the foundation's annual budget, was criticized by some commentators as excessive. In a July 10, 2011, interview with Drew Pinsky, Palin said she doesn't want to \\"be named as an abstinence preacher .... I'm not out there saying don't have sex. I hate that kind of stuff. Birth control needs to be used effectively each and every single time if you're gonna be having sex. ... I'm not advocating [abstinence] for everyone else.\\" On July 13, 2011, Palin had an interview with Christianity Today in which she reaffirmed her stance on abstinence. Discussing whether she still thought that abstinence was unrealistic, as she had said in 2009, she said \\"that quote was taken out of context. What I am trying to say is it's not realistic for everyone...but for me, my sisters, and my family, I believe that the right way.\\" Palin still feels that abstinence is the only choice for her and her family. In 2015, Bristol Palin took to her blog to correct the media regarding what the Candies Organization is and her role within it, stating, \\"Let's get another thing straight, because I can't tolerate all the talk on this subject. I have never been paid as an ‚Äúabstinence spokesperson.‚Äù I was employed by the great people at The Candies Foundation. They are a teen pregnancy prevention non-profit and I worked for them when I was 18 and 19 ‚Äî when I could share first hand the challenges of being a teen mother. I know you remember me most from when Mom ran for Vice President. However, I'm not 17 anymore, I am 24. I've been employed at the same doctor's office for over six years now; I own a home; I have a well-rounded, beautiful son. I am pregnant [with my second child.] This is not the ideal situation, but life is important even if it's not in the most absolute ideal circumstance. This is more confirmation on what I've always stood for. I've always been pro-life and I am standing for life now.\\" Paid speeches In May 2010, the media reported that Palin had signed with the company Single Source Speakers, asking between $15,000 and $30,000 for each appearance. She was listed on the company's website as available for conferences, fundraisers, special events and holidays, as well as women's, youth, abstinence, and pro-life programs. In January 2011, Palin was invited to speak by Washington University in St. Louis as the keynote speaker for \\"Abstinence in College\\" at Sexual Responsibility Week. Students protested both the high fee she was to be paid out of student- generated funds and her lack of expertise on abstinence in college. Her appearance was cancelled. Television =The Secret Life of the American Teenager= Palin appeared in an episode of the ABC Family network series The Secret Life of the American Teenager, playing a friend of the fictional character Amy, a 15-year-old who is dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. She filmed the scenes in Los Angeles in March 2010; the episode aired on July 5, 2010. \\"I like doing speaking engagements and stuff like that,\\" she said, adding, \\"I don't think I'll be doing any more acting in the future.\\" =Dancing with the Stars, season 11= Palin was a competitor on the fall 2010 season of Dancing with the Stars. She was partnered with professional Mark Ballas, a two-time champion on the show who won with Olympic figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi in Season 6, and with Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson in Season 8.\\"DWTS Women: Jennifer Grey, Florence Henderson, Bristol Palin, Brandy and More DWTS cast\\" , Brian Krassenstein, August 31, 2010, TheNewsofToday.com. The show was televised from September through November 2010. Despite getting the lowest scores from the judges for a number of weeks, Palin and Ballas avoided being eliminated during the season. That attracted media attention and speculation. Questions were raised about the integrity of the public voting process\\"Bristol Palin's Dancing Success\\", Roger Catlin, November 11, 2010, The Huffington Post. including allegations of fraudulent online voting using multiple e-mail addresses. Executives at ABC and the show's executive producer, Conrad Green, stated that \\"checks and balances\\" in the system, including IP address verification, prevent such voting practices, and that \\"[t]here's nothing in the voting that looks dissimilar to previous seasons\\". Nonetheless, Green speculated that Palin may have received votes from her mother's fans and other supporters, and from older viewers who had maternal feelings toward her due to her youth and lack of prior experience. Palin credited her success to the support of her fans who were tuning in each week to see her improvement. Palin's success on the show attracted other negative attention, including death threats against her. In one instance, suspicious white powder was received by the show. The powder turned out to be harmless, but security on the show was tightened. On the final show of the season, Palin and Ballas finished in third place. Prior to that show, Palin said that winning \\"would be like a big middle finger out there to all the people out there who hate my mom and hate me\\". Following the competition, she remarked that she was happy with her third-place finish, that prayer and faith had helped her, and that she had grown as a person. =Sarah Palin's Alaska= In November 2010, Bristol Palin made an appearance on the TLC travelogue- documentary Sarah Palin's Alaska. She helped the crew on a commercial halibut fishing boat. =Music video= In October 2010, while competing on Dancing With the Stars Season 11, Palin appeared in a music video for an Alaskan symphony rock band called Static Cycle.

It reached #21 on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction. Personal life 2008 Republican National Convention and pregnancy announcement When John McCain chose Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential running mate in late August 2008, his advisers had already been informed of her 17-year-old daughter Bristol's pregnancy, which they believed would be a political liability because the teen was unmarried. On September 1, the opening day of the 2008 Republican National Convention, it was publicly announced that Palin was pregnant and engaged to Levi Johnston, her baby's father. Palin's entire family, along with Johnston, appeared at the convention. McCain's advisers reportedly thought a wedding between Johnston and Palin would boost the waning popularity of the McCain-Palin ticket. Johnston denied claims that he was being pressured into a shotgun wedding, stating, \\"We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid. That was the plan from the start.\\" Relationships and children Two months after her 18th birthday, Palin gave birth to her and Johnston's son, Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston- Palin, on December 27, 2008. In response to the suggestion that it would have been more prudent to abort her pregnancy and that she only carried it to term because of her mother's views on the issue she responded: 'It doesn't matter what my mom's views are on it. It was my decision.' Palin and Johnston ended their engagement in March 2009. In November 2009, a custody and child support case was filed in a local Alaska court. Palin asked the court to use pseudonyms for herself and Johnston to keep the normally public proceedings private, arguing that the media attention would not be good for the child. Johnston argued for open proceedings, as the power of the Palin family was relevant to the case, which he claimed he wanted to be decided on the merits, and that he did \\"not feel protected against Sarah Palin in a closed proceeding.\\" On December 27, 2009--Tripp's first birthday--the judge ruled in favor of Johnston, and it was publicly announced that the pair had been battling for legal custody. Palin tried to win full custody rights and child support consistent with Johnston's income, made statements that Johnston had \\"exercised sporadic visitation rights\\", and tried to present him as a bad father by speculating without offering evidence that he \\"wants the rights for his own self-promotion\\". Johnston sought shared custody and lower child support payments. In February 2010, a judge ruled that Johnston had to pay back child support, with a hearing set to determine the amount of ongoing support payments. That month, Palin and her son began living in a condo she had purchased in Anchorage, where she was working at a dermatologist's office and taking business courses at a community college. In July 2010, Palin and Johnston announced that they had reunited and were again engaged, but less than three weeks later, they ended their second engagement.\\"Bristol Palin to Levi Johnston: 'It's Over'\\".

In December 2010, Palin purchased a five-bedroom house in Maricopa, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, for $172,000 in cash, according to Pinal County property records. The house was sold in May 2012 for $175,000, and Palin moved back to Alaska. On March 13, 2015, Palin announced she had become engaged to Dakota Meyer, a former Marine and Medal of Honor recipient. According to Bristol's blog, she first met Meyer in 2014 while filming Amazing America with her mother Sarah Palin in Alaska. On May 18, 2015, Palin's mother announced that the wedding planned for later in the week had been called off.

On August 1, 2018, Palin confirmed that her divorce from Meyer had been finalized. LGBT-related issues Palin has been in the headlines on numerous occasions for making anti-gay and anti-gay-marriage comments which have often drawn criticism from defenders of LGBT rights: In September 2011 she got into an argument in a bar with a man who criticized her mother; Palin accused him of being a homosexual.

It is the mother church of the Diocese of Pueblo. Its building, built in 1912-13, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It was deemed \\"an outstanding example of Gothic Revival architecture, includes an inspiring spire, pointed arch windows, and soaring interior vaulting\\". With History In October 1860, Fr. Projectus Machebeuf, and Fr. J.B. Raverdy began the 300-mile journey from Santa Fe, New Mexico, north into Colorado Territory. Months later they arrived at the Arkansas River, at the present site of the city of Pueblo. Initially, the priests celebrated mass in the homes of local Catholics, then they began to hold public services in the old Courthouse on 3rd and Santa Fe Avenue, until finally a proper church was established on 13th and West Streets. In 1873 it was the first parish in Pueblo, and it was called St. Ignatius. A fire destroyed St. Ignatius and its rectory in 1882. Under the direction of the Jesuit priests assigned to serve it, money was raised and second church was built. This time St. Ignatius was situated near the heart of the city, on Grand between 10th and 11th Streets. Eventually, it served as the parish hall when the present church was built under the pastorate of Msgr. Thomas Wolohan. In 1910, Msgr. Wolohan began planning for a new church to be dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. On May 5, 1912, the church cornerstone was laid, and within a year, Sacred Heart was dedicated by the Most Reverend Nicholas Matz, Archbishop of Denver. The construction costs of the church were $48,000 and was realized with the help of the congregation of 190 families. Msgr. Wolohan served as pastor of Sacred Heart for thirty-six years. He is buried in a crypt in the cathedral. On November 15, 1941, Sacred Heart was elevated to the status of a Cathedral with the establishment of the new Diocese of Pueblo. Since the establishment of Sacred Heart as a Cathedral, it has been served by eight rectors and administrators. In the past few years, the parish has grown from 930 families to well over 1,200. It truly has become a model of good liturgy and ministry for other parishes to emulate as the parish church of the Bishop. In 1997, the Cathedral celebrated its 125th anniversary with a year-long series of events. It adopted as its motto that year, Strong at Heart after 125 years. In 1989, the Cathedral was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 2008, the steeple of the cathedral was struck by lightning and was engulfed by flames and was damaged. Work has been completed to replace the steeple and install a lightning rod. Work was done by HW Houston Construction and Vision Mechanical and the new cross was dedicated. The Bishop of Pueblo was then Stephen Berg.

While this disease was first described in 1965, the identity of Brugia timori as the causative agent was not known until 1977. In that same year, Anopheles barbirostris was shown to be its primary vector. There is no known animal reservoir host. Signs and symptoms Like other human filariasis infections, Brugia timori filariasis causes acute fever and chronic lymphedema. The life cycle of Brugia timori is very similar to that of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, leading to nocturnal periodicity of the disease symptoms. Eosinophilia is common during acute stages of infection. So far Brugia timori has only been found in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia. It is locally confined to areas inhabited by its mosquito vector, which breeds in rice fields. One study of the prevalence of infection in Mainang village, Alor Island, found microfilariae in the blood of 157 of 586 individuals (27%), with 77 of them (13%) exhibiting lymphedema of the leg. Parasite The microfilariae of Brugia timori are longer and morphologically distinct from those of Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti, with a cephalic space length-to-width ratio of about 3:1. B. timori more closely resembles the symptoms caused by B. malayi and morphologically resembles B. malayi.\\"Lymphatic Filariasis Endemic Countries and Territories.\\" Lymphatic Filariasis Disease. May 2006. The Carter Center. 13 May 2006. Also, the sheath of B. timori does not stain pink with Giemsa stain as is observed with B. malayi and W. bancrofti.  Life cycle  The life cycle is: # During feeding, mosquitos ingest the infective filariform from an infected host # Inside the mosquito the microfilariae penetrate the midgut and migrate to muscle tissue to grow and undergo two molts into infective filariform larvae (no sexual reproduction occurs within the mosquito) # The filariform larvae will migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquito # Larvae enter the host's circulation and migrate to lymphatic vessels where they develop into microfilariae-producing adults. Here the adults can live for several years # The infective filariform enter the circulation of the host to repeat the life cycle  Morphology  B. timori microfilariae have nuclei that extend to the tip of the tail, which is also characteristic of B. malayi but not W. bancrofti. B. timori microfilariae are slightly larger than B. malayi microfilariae.  Endosymbiont  Aside from vectoring Brugia species, mosquitoes also maintain Wolbachia spp. which has been found to be an obligate intracellular bacterial endosymbiont of Brugia spp. Wolbachia supports essential biochemical pathways necessary for the survival of Brugia, especially processes such as embryogenesis and molting. Treatment Anthelmintics such as diethylcarbamazine and albendazole have shown promise in the treatment of Brugia timori filariasis. Some researchers are confident that Brugia timori filariasis may be an eradicable disease. Related filarial nematodes have been found highly sensitive to elimination of their endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria, and this may be a powerful attack route against Brugia timori as well.

She is always picked up in a car by a Secret Service agent. In Moscow, an agent in the Kremlin manages to get hold of a secret document identifying Donna Morton as a KGB agent sent to spy on the president. This document is passed back to Washington, where it comes into the possession of the CSA (a thinly disguised version of the CIA). They begin to put Donna Morton under surveillance. The same day, her brother Ben Morton ‚Äì a Washington businessman and occasional courier for the CSA ‚Äì arrived back in the city. On the plane he meets and romances Mugsy Evans. When Donna Morton suddenly turns up dead in her apartment moments before she was due to be picked up by her Secret Service driver, he begins to investigate. He discovers her affair with the president, and through his contacts with the Secret Service, he discovers a CSA agent was seen leaving her apartment building around the time of his death. The Secret Service agent who regularly drove Donna, informs him that the CSA were there, but before any more information can be passed on, she is killed. Realising now that the CSA had played a large role in her death, Ben Morton confronts the head of the CSA, who tells him it was the Soviets who killed her, and that she was a Soviet agent.

The protein encoded by this gene is an aminopeptidase which is most closely related in sequence to leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). APO is a member of the M1 metalloproteinase family. Structure The C9ORF3 aminopeptidase enzyme contains the following domains: * LTA4H-like N-terminal domain * gluzincin aminopeptidase domain * SH3-like motif * ARM C-terminal domain Function The C9ORF3 aminopeptidase cleaves the N-terminal amino acid from polypeptides and shows a strong preference for peptides in which the N-terminus is arginine and to a lesser extent asparagine. Furthermore, the activity of the enzyme is inhibited by o-phenanthroline, a metalloprotease inhibitor and by arphamenine A, a potent inhibitor of aminopeptidases such as LTA4H.

However, with the election of Shavkat Mirziyoyev as President of Uzbekistan Uzbek-Tajik relations, as well as relations between Uzbekistan and its neighbors in Central Asia, reached a new era of potential.http://tashkenttimes.uz/national/2134-uzbekistan-tajikistan- sign-27-accords Practical implementation of this potential is yet to be seen and by 2020 the Central Asian region remains one of the least integrated regions in the world.Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia‚Äù, in Fanny M. Cheung and Ying-yi Hong (eds) Regional Connection under the Belt and Road Initiative. The Prospects for Economic and Financial Cooperation. London: Routledge, p. 116. Before independence The Russian Empire (1721‚Äì1917) controlled Russian Turkestan as a singular unit; the creation of \\"nations\\" within Central Asia was not on the agenda of Russian policy makers. However, revolutionary fervor from the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923) spilled over from the former Ottoman Empire into Russian lands. Based on the ideology of Pan-Turkism, which seeks to unite all speakers of Turkic languages from Anatolia to China into a single state, the Young Turk leader Enver Pasha lead the Basmachi Revolt in Soviet Central Asia. However, pan-Turkist reformers and Jadids, even members of the anti-Basmachi Communist Party of Turkestan, were hostile to the claim of Tajiks and other non-Turkic peoples to a separate identity in Central Asia. The establishment of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (commonly known as Uzbekistan) in 1924 as part of national delimitation in the Soviet Union resulted in the Uzbekization of the Tajik cultural centers of Samarcand and Bukhara, as well as of all Tajiks in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, since Tajikistan was not afforded the status of its own Soviet Socialist Republic. The ethnogenesis of the \\"Uzbeks\\" involved the liquidation of certain other ethnicities like Sarts and Kuramas, who identified with other Iranian peoples like the Tajiks before assimilation into the Uzbek nation. Eventually, however, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (also known as Tajikistan in short) was created in 1929. Turkic, Caucasian, Cossack, and Crimean collaborationism with the Axis powers during World War II resulted in a reaction from Soviet authorities which included population transfers that brought Caucasians to Central Asia. Both republics participated in the referendum in March 1991 in an attempt to preserve the Soviet Union in a different form, but was soon hampered by the attempted coup in August of that year. As a consequence, both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan declared their independence in the months of 1991 and became members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in which officially gave way for the dismemberment of the Soviet Union at the end of the year. File:Flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.svgFlag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic File:Flag of Tajik SSR.svgFlag of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic 1992-1997 Tajikistani civil war After the Soviet Union fell in 1991, conflicts between both groups emerged when Tajiks attacked Uzbek goods in Tajikistan whilst Uzbeks banned Tajik goods in Uzbekistan. The Civil war in Tajikistan broke out when ethnic groups in Tajikistan began clashing, and they later engaged into a war with devastating casualties. During this war, Uzbek troops entered into Tajikistan prevent war, but their efforts were futile due to personal disagreements between leaders of both countries. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan received a flood of Uzbek and Tajik refugees from Tajikistan due to the ongoing war, most of whom remained in Uzbekistan after the war. Energy conflicts Rogun dam Tajikistan had long planned to build what would be the world's largest hydropower dam, the Rogun Dam, on the Vakhsh River. The project was initially proposed by Soviet engineers in the 1950s, but actual construction was postponed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The dam would bring energy independence to Tajikistan, but Uzbekistan argues it would damage its lucrative cotton industry by drying up rivers. In 2012, Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov warned, without naming Tajikistan, that certain dam projects may lead to a regional war in Central Asia. Gas export to Tajikistan Tajikistan depends mainly on gas imported from Uzbekistan, and has few other energy sources; as a result, it suffers from chronic electricity shortages. Uzbekistan uses the energy arm to curb Tajikistan in the Rogun Dam dispute. Analysts estimate Tajikistan‚Äôs gas requirements at 1.2 billion m¬≥/year while in 2012, the country only received one-tenth of this amount at a price of US $300/1000 m¬≥. This quantity has been enough to operate just one Tajik power plant. Kamchik Pass railway In 2013, Uzbekistan announced its plan to build a new railway through the Kamchik Pass, connecting the cities of Tashkent and Namangan. The new railway route will replace the old Soviet-era railway that cuts through northern Tajikistan. It would save Uzbekistan a reported $25 million per year in transit fees, and may become part of a long- planned rail route to China. Tajik experts have stated concern that this would potentially further isolate Tajikistan which is already the poorest country in the region. In February 2015, the World Bank announced it would loan $195 million towards the construction of the railway. Development in relations With the election of Shavkat Mirziyoyev as President of Uzbekistan Uzbek-Tajik relations, as well as relations between Uzbekistan and its neighbors in Central Asia, reached a new era of potential. Mirziyoyev and Emomali Rahmon have met several times since September 2016, and in March 2018, Mirziyoyev made an historic visit to Dushanbe, where 27 bilateral agreements were signed in the fields of trade, economy, investment, finance, transport and transit, agriculture, water and energy, taxes, customs, tourism, education and science, health, culture, interregional cooperation, in the field of security and countering crime.

Life The son of a grocer, he left his father's home to devote himself to the theatre and presented himself to Lekain in Paris for a job. Engaged in Madame Montansier's company, he played at Tours, then at Lyon, and came back to Paris where Mademoiselle Clairon took him under her protection. Larive made his debut at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on 3 December 1770 but was not well received.

It was here that he got to known his future wife, Eug√©nie D'Hannetaire, the director's eldest daughter, whom he married in Paris on 18 June 1776 (they divorced in 1794). He was a friend of Voltaire and interpreted many of his lead roles. On 29 April 1775, Larive made another first appearance at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and was admitted as a soci√©taire on the following 18 May. Three years later, the death of Lekain put him in first place among the soci√©taires. He regularly toured the provinces and appeared in his birthplace in 1780, as well as in Lille, Geneva and Bordeaux. He left the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 1788 but returned to it in 1790, after appearing in Lille.

Mainland China Late-Qing Dynasty Science fiction in China was initially popularized through translations of Western authors during the late- Qing dynasty by proponents of Western-style modernization such as Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei as a tool to spur technological innovation and scientific progress. With his translation of Jules Verne's A Two-Year Vacation into Classical Chinese (as Fifteen Little Heroes), Liang Qichao became one of the first and most influential advocates of science fiction in Chinese. In 1903, Lu Xun, who later became famous for his darkly satirical essays and short stories, translated Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and Journey to the Centre of the Earth from Japanese into Classical Chinese (rendering it in the traditional zhang wei ban style and adding expository notes) while studying medicine at the Kobun Institute (ÂºòÊñáÂ≠∏Èô¢ Kobun Gakuin) in Japan. He would continue to translate many of Verne's and H.G. Wells' classic stories, nationally popularizing these through periodical publication. The earliest work of original science fiction in Chinese is believed to be the unfinished novel Lunar Colony (ÊúàÁêÉÊÆñÊ∞ëÂú∞Â∞èË™™), published in 1904 by an unknown author under the pen name Old Fisherman of the Secluded River (ËçíÊ±üÈá£Âèü).http://news.sciencenet.cn/sbhtmlnews/2012/5/258520.shtm?id=258520‰∏≠ÂõΩÊó©ÊúüÁöÑÁßëÂπªÂàõ‰ΩúËØïÈ™å The story concerns Long Menghua, who flees China with his wife after killing a government official who was harassing his wife's family. The ship they escape on is accidentally sunk and Long's wife disappears. However, Long is rescued by Otoro Tama, the Japanese inventor of a dirigible who helps him travel to Southeast Asia searching for his wife. They join with a group of anti-Qing martial artists to rescue her from bandits. Deciding that the nations of the world are too corrupt, they all travel to the moon and establish a new colony. Republican Era Following the collapse of the Qing-dynasty in 1911, China went through a series of dramatic social and political changes which affected the genre of science fiction tremendously. Following the May Fourth Movement in 1919 written vernacular Chinese began to replace Classical Chinese as the written language of the Chinese mainland in addition to Chinese-speaking communities around the world. China's earliest purely literary periodical, Story Forest (Â∞èË™™Êûó), founded by Xu Nianci, not only published translated science fiction, but also original science fiction such as New Conch Shell Mr. Tan (Êñ∞Ê≥ïËû∫ÂÖàÁîüË≠ö). Meanwhile, Lao She employed science fiction for the purpose of social criticism in his science fiction novel Cat Country which was also published during this time period. People's Republic of China =1949‚Äì1966= Following the Chinese civil war (1945‚Äì49) and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, works with an ethos of socialist realism inspired by Soviet science fiction became more common while others works were suppressed. Still, many original works were created during this time, particularly ones with \\"popular science\\" approach aim to popularize science among younger readers and promote the country's \\"wonderful socialist future.\\" Zheng Wenguang in particular is known as the ‚Äòfather of Chinese science fiction‚Äô for his writings during this period up until the beginning of Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76) when the printing of non-revolutionary literature was suspended. =1978‚Äì1983= During the Cultural Revolution, very little literature was printed and science fiction essentially disappeared in mainland China. However, following the March 1978 National Science Congress convened by the Central Committee and the State Council and its proclamation that \\"science's spring has come,\\" a greater enthusiasm for popular science (and thus science fiction) followed, with the publication of the children's novel Ye Yonglie's Xiao Lingtong's Travels in the Future („ÄäÂ∞èÁÅµÈÄöÊº´Ê∏∏Êú™Êù•„Äã) in the same year as the 1978 National Science Congress marked a revival of science fiction literature in China.http://baike.baidu.com/view/742998.htmÂ∞èÁÅµÈÄöÊº´Ê∏∏Êú™Êù• In 1979, the newly founded magazine Scientific Literature („ÄäÁßëÂ≠¶ÊñáËâ∫„Äã) began publishing translations and original science fiction and Zheng Wenguang again devoted himself to writing science fiction during this period. Tong Enzheng wrote Death Ray on a Coral Island, which was later adapted into China's first science fiction movie. Other important writers from this time period include Liu Xingshi, Wang Xiaoda, and Hong Kong author Ni Kuang. In his monograph, Rudolf G. Wagner argues during this brief rebirth of science fiction in China scientists used the genre to symbolically describe the political and social standing to which the scientific community desired following its own rehabilitation.Rudolf G. Wagner, \\"Lobby Literature: The Archaeology and Present Functions of Science Fiction in the People's Republic of China\\", in J. Kinkley (ed.), After Mao: Chinese Literature and Society 1978-1981. Harvard East Asian Monographs 115. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985, pp. 17-62. This rehabilitation suffered a setback during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign (1983‚Äì1984), when Biao Qian labelled science fiction as \\"spiritual pollution.\\" This led to authors such as Ye Yonglie, Tong Enzheng, Liu Xingshi, and Xiao Jianheng being condemned for slander and the publication of science-fiction in mainland China once again being prohibited indefinitely. =1991‚Äìpresent= In 1991, Yang Xiao, then the director of the magazine Scientific Art and Literature which had survived the ban on science fiction during the 1980s by changing their name to Strange Tales and publishing non-fiction works, decided to run a science fiction convention in Chengdu, Sichuan. Not only was this the first- ever international science fiction convention to be held in mainland China,ÁßëÂπª‰∏ñÁïå it was also the first international event to be hosted in China since the student protests of 1989.Kun Kun: But Some of Us are Looking at the Stars Scientific Literature changed its name to Science Fiction World („ÄäÁßëÂπª‰∏ñÁïå„Äã), and by the mid-1990s, had reached a peak circulation of about 400,000. Authors who came to prominence during the 1990s include Liu Cixin, Han Song, Wang Jinkang, Xing He, Qian Lifang, and He Xi. In particular, Liu, Han and Wang became popularly known as the 'Three Generals of Chinese Sci-fi'. As a genre, science fiction came to the fore when the 1999 national college entrance exam included the science fiction question, ‚ÄúWhat if memories could be transplanted?‚Äù Wang Jinkang is the most prolific of the three, having published over 50 short stories and 10 novels. While working as a chassis engineer for oil rigs, he began writing short stories as a way to entertain his son and teach him scientific concepts, a focus he has maintained throughout his writing career. In an article published in the Commercial Press's bi-monthly magazine on Chinese culture, The World of Chinese, Echo Zhao (ËµµËïæ) describes his writing as being pervaded with \\"a sense of heroic morality\\" that avoids the \\"grim finality\\" of an apocalyptic future, citing examples of clones with bumps on their fingers to distinguish them from non- clones and robots whose hearts explode when they desire life. Liu Cixin's work has been especially well-received, with his Three Bodies (‰∏â‰Ωì) trilogy selling over 500,000 copies in China (as of the end of 2012). The books, which describe an alien civilization that invades earth over a vast span of time, have drawn comparisons to the works of Arthur C. Clarke by fellow science fiction author Fei Dao, while Echo Zhao describes Liu Cixin's writing as \\"lush and imaginative\\" with a particular interest in military technology. Han Song, a journalist, writes darkly satirical novels and short stories which lampoon modern social problems. His novel 2066: Red Star Over America which describes a Chinese invasion and takeover of the United States, and his short story collection Subway which features alien abductions and cannibalism on a never- ending train ride, have been lauded for their sense of social justice. He has been quoted as saying, \\"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy for foreigners to understand China and the Chinese. They need to develop a dialectical understanding, see all sides, just as we appreciate the ‚Äòyin‚Äô and the ‚Äòyang.‚Äô I hope to prevent tragedy in China, and in the world, with my writing. I don't think humans have rid themselves of their innate evil. It's just suppressed by technology. If there is a spark of chaos, the worst will happen. That goes for all people, whether Chinese or Western. We should keep thinking back to why terrible things have happened in history and not allow those things to happen again.‚Äù Hao Jingfang won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette for Folding Beijing in 2016. Meanwhile in the area of film and television, works such as the science fiction comedy Magic Cellphone (È≠îÂπªÊâãÊú∫) explored themes of time travel and advanced technology. On March 31, 2011, however the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) issued guidelines that supposedly strongly discouraged television storylines including \\"fantasy, time-travel, random compilations of mythical stories, bizarre plots, absurd techniques, even propagating feudal superstitions, fatalism and reincarnation, ambiguous moral lessons, and a lack of positive thinking\\". However, even with that numerous science fiction literature with those themes and elements have been published since, some of which have been compiled into an English-Language anthology by Ken Liu called Broken Stars: Contemporary Chinese Science Fiction in Translation. Taiwan Following the defeat of the Qing Dynasty in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895), the island of Taiwan came under the sovereign rule to the Empire of Japan who eventually instituted a policy of 'Japanization' that discouraged the use of Chinese language and scripts in Taiwan. When the island was ceded to the Republic of China after the end of World War II in 1945, the majority of Japanese colonialists were repatriated to Japan and the KMT, the ruling party of the RoC, quickly established control of the island. This was to prove key to the survival of the RoC government, who were forced to move their capital to the island after their defeat by the communists in the Chinese Civil War. The KMT pursued a policy of rapid sinification which, in combination with an influx of mainland intellectuals, spurred the development of Chinese-language literature in Taiwan and along with it, science fiction. Taiwanese science fiction authors include Wu Mingyi (Âê≥ÊòéÁõä), Zhang Xiaofeng (ÂºµÊõâÈ¢®), Zhang Ziguo (Âº†Á≥ªÂõΩ), Huang Hai (ÈªÉÊµ∑), Huang Fan (ÈªÉÂá°), Ye Yandou (ËëâË®ÄÈÉΩ), Lin Yaode (ÊûóÁáøÂæ∑), Zhang Dachun (ÂºµÂ§ßÊò•), Su Yiping (ËòáÈÄ∏Âπ≥), Chi Ta-wei (Á¥ÄÂ§ßÂÅâ), Hong Ling (Ê¥™Âáå), Ye Xuan (ËëâËªí), Mo Handu (Êº†ÂØíÊ∏°), Yu Wo (Âæ°Êàë), and Mo Ren (Ëé´‰ªÅ). Hong Kong In Chinese, Hong Kong's best known science fiction author is the prolific Ni Kuang, creator of the Wisely Series (Ë°õÊñØÁêÜ). More recently, Chan Koonchung's dystopian novel The Fat Years about a near future mainland China has been compared to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World. Huang Yi is another well known Wuxia and science fiction author whose time travel novel Xun Qin Ji () was adapted into a popular TV drama called A Step into the Past by TVB. Malaysia Zhang Cao (ÂºµËçâ) is a Malaysian-Chinese science fiction author who has published several novels in Chinese. Chinese language and culture in science fiction works from other countries * Cordwainer Smith's short stories and novel, Norstrilia, which is said to be based on the Chinese classic Journey to the West, feature a race of 'underpeople' bred out of animals to serve mankind whose struggle for independence has been argued to be an allegory of the civil rights movement. Alan C. Elms, Professor of Psychology Emeritus, University of California, Davis, however argues that underpeople are meant to represent the Han Chinese who had been oppressed by the conquering Manchus during the Qing dynasty, citing the author's experiences working with Sun Yat Sen as a young man. * An English translation of the Tao Te Ching plays an important role in Ursula K. Le Guin's 1967 post-apocalyptic novel City of Illusions. The novel also features a supposedly alien race called the Shing who suppress technological and social development on Earth, similar to the suppression of Western technology and ideas during the Qing dynasty following a period of relative openness during the Ming when Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci were allowed to live and teach in China. * Although not strictly science fiction in that it lacks significant aberrations from the historical record, James Clavell's historical fiction series The Asian Saga is intimately concerned with the role which modern technology played in the collision between the East and West in the 19th and 20th centuries. * David Wingrove's multivolume Chung Kuo series takes place in an alternate timeline where Imperial China has survived into modern era and eventually takes over the entire world, establishing a future society with a strict racial hierarchy. * Maureen F. McHugh's 1997 novel, China Mountain Zhang, takes place in an alternate future where America has gone through a socialist revolution while China has become the dominant world power. * The 2002 American television show Firefly features a future space-based society in the year 2517 where Mandarin Chinese has become a common language. * Cory Doctorow‚Äôs 2010 young adult science fiction novel For the Win features a gold farmer from Shenzhen, China who joins forces with Leonard Goldberg, a sinophile gamer who speaks Mandarin Chinese and uses the Chinese name ‚ÄòWei-Dong‚Äô, to take on the mainland authorities and gold farming bosses. * The 2012 American film Red Dawn, a re-imagining of the 1984 film by the same name, as originally filmed portrayed the invasion of the United States by the People's Liberation Army of the PRC due to a US default on Chinese-owned debt. In hopes of being able to market the film in mainland China, the country of origin for the invading army was later changed to North Korea using digital technology, and references to the storyline about debt were edited out of the final cut of the film. * The titular computer virus in American author Neal Stephenson‚Äôs 2011 technothriller Reamde was developed by a crew of mainland Chinese based gold farmers and a significant portion of the book takes place in Xiamen, Fujian. * The prolific short story writer Chinese- American Ken Liu has published numerous original English-language science fiction stories featuring Chinese characters and settings, exploring issues of tradition, modernity, development, and cultural differences between the East and West. Two of his stories have also been published in Chinese, and has translated short stories by Liu Cixin, Chen Qiufan, Xia Jia and Ma Boyong. English translations and academic studies Joel Martinsen, a translator who works for the website Danwei.org, has promoted Chinese science fiction in English for a number of years, both on his blog Twelve Hours Later: Literature from the other side of the globe ‚Äî Chinese SF, fantasy, and mainstream fiction and also on various websites around the Internet, often posting under the username 'zhwj'. Along with Ken Liu and Eric Abrahamsen, Martinesen translated Liu Cixin's \\"Three Body\\" trilogy for China Educational Publications Import & Export Corporation (CEPIT), with print and digital editions of the first two novels released in the first half of 2013 and the third in 2014.http://english.dbw.cn/system/2012/11/08/000587559.shtml The second issue of the literary monthly Chutzpah! edited by Ou Ning contains a in-depth history of Chinese fiction compiled by Kun Kun entitled Some of Us Are Looking at the Stars, and translations of Chinese science fiction authors Han Song, Fei Dao, Chen Qiufan, Yang Ping into English, in addition to translations of English-language science fiction authors such as William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Paolo Bagicalupi and Jeff Noon into Chinese.Chutzpah! Issue 2: Universal Narratives In 2012, the Hong Kong journal Renditions: A Chinese- English Translation Magazine issued a special double issue (Renditions No. 77 & 78) with a focus on science fiction, including works from both the early 20th century and the early 21st century. In March 2013, the peer-reviewed journal Science Fiction Studies released a special issue on Chinese Science Fiction, edited by Yan Wu and Veronica Hollinger. Tor Books publishes most of the English translated novels in the United States, including the entire Three Body series. Worthy of note are also the entries on Chinese science fiction mainly written by Jonathan Clements for The encyclopedia of science fiction, edited by J. Clute, D. Langford and P. Nicholls. In other European publishing markets, such as Italy, many translations are based on the English versions.

He played for the Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians  Playing career   Early years  Jim√©nez began his playing career with Puebla in 1974 at the age of 16. In 1975, he was signed as a free agent by the Chicago Cubs organization, where he played for the Key West Cubs. After batting just .215 as their regular shortstop, he returned to Pericos for two seasons. He had a brief trial with the Chicago White Sox organization in 1978, batting .220 in 13 games.  Twins  After two more seasons with Puebla, Jim√©nez signed with the Minnesota Twins before the 1981 season. At the end of spring training, he was purchased by the Broncos de Reynosa. After spending a season and a half with Reynosa, he was reacquired by the Twins, finishing the season with the Toledo Mud Hens. Jim√©nez started 1983 with the Mud Hens, but was called up to the majors in June. He spent the rest of the season splitting time at shortstop with Ron Washington. The following year, Jim√©nez became the Twins' starter, playing in 108 games. However, 1984 would prove to be the only full season he spent at the major league level. After batting just .201, he spent all of the 1985 season with Toledo, then was released just before the start of the 1986 season.  Pirates and Indians  After spending 1986 out of organized ball, Jim√©nez signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in December. He spent most of the 1987 season with the Vancouver Canadians, playing in just six games for the Pirates, for whom he went hitless in 7 at bats. He became a free agent after the season. In June 1988, Jim√©nez signed with the Cleveland Indians. His experience was similar to the previous year, as he spent most of the season in Triple-A with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. He appeared in eight games with the Indians, managing just one hit in 21 at-bats.  Back to Mexico  After spending several years playing winter ball, Jim√©nez returned to the Mexican League in 1993 with the Saraperos de Saltillo. He played there until his retirement in 2001.

His high-rise office buildings and hotels were instrumental in changing the face of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, his base of operations. Uniquely for his time, he formed business relationships across religious, ethnic and social lines and played a major role in reforming politics in Philadelphia as well as at the national level.Dan Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. xi-xiii. Early life and business activities Greenfield was born Avrum Moishe Grunfeld to a Jewish familyRottenberg, The Outsider, p. 13 in 1887 to trader Jacob Gruenfeld and wife Esther (n√©e Serody) in Lozovata, a village in what is now south-central Ukraine. After emigrating to New York City in 1892, he and his family (with names anglicized) moved in 1896 to Philadelphia, settling in South Philadelphia where Jacob Greenfield ironed shirts in a factory and operated a grocery in the family's home.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 17-21. Albert left high school at age 14 to become a clerk for a prominent local real estate lawyer.Rottenberg, The Outsider, 21-24. In this position, Greenfield found his calling as a real estate broker. In May 1905, Greenfield opened his own real estate firm at 218 South 4th Street, with $500 that his mother borrowed for him from her brother.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 27. Within seven years Greenfield was earning $60,000 a year; by 1917, his personal wealth had increased to $15 million.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p.28. During the 1920s he largely rebuilt the face of downtown Philadelphia, creating numerous landmark office buildings and hotels, including what was then the world's largest hotel, the Benjamin Franklin, in 1925.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 53. The alliances created through his growing real estate business led to investments in motion picture theaters, building and loan associations, and mortgage financing. By the early 1920s he controlled 27 building and loan associations. In 1924, Greenfield and his father-in-law Sol C. Kraus formed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company to handle first mortgages on real estate in Philadelphia. After expanding to the New York City market, the firm was renamed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company of America. By 1930 his real estate concern, known as Albert M. Greenfield & Co. since 1911, was the largest real estate company in the U.S.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p.28, 35. and Greenfield sought to become a commercial banker. In late 1926 he bought a controlling interest in a small West Philadelphia bank and, through a series of acquisitions, built it over the next four years into Bankers Trust Company, Philadelphia's tenth largest bank, with $50 million in deposits.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 4 In May 1928, Greenfield formed the Bankers Securities Corporation (BSC) for general investment banking and trading in securities, which eventually became the parent company for virtually all of Greenfield's financial interests. But a run on his bank forced the closing of Bankers Trust on December 22, 1930, and ended Greenfield's career as a banker, leaving him millions in debt. But in the depth of the Great Depression, he refused to seek bankruptcy protection and instead reinvented himself as a retailing magnate, gaining control of the insolvent City Stores Company, a chain that operated seven department stores in six states. The company expanded throughout the East Coast over the next 20 years.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 155-163. When asked much later about his negative experiences during the Depression, Greenfield replied, \\"It wasn't too bad. I've always treated both success and failure as imposters. I like making money, but I can get along without it. I never worried about having it because I knew I could always make more.\\" Politics In 1917, Greenfield was elected to a seat on the Philadelphia Common Council and served until 1920. Originally a Republican, he switched parties with the advent of the New Deal in 1933 and remained a strong Democratic supporter until his death. He enjoyed a close relationship with many Presidents from Herbert Hoover to Lyndon Johnson. In 1951 he played a major role in the defeat of Philadelphia's long-entrenched Republican machine. As chairman of Philadelphia's City Planning Commission under Mayor Richardson Dilworth (1956‚Äì58), he laid the foundation for the development of Society Hill as a unique upper-middle-class enclave capable of luring suburbanites back to downtown.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 235-248. Because of his political activism, in 1948 Philadelphia hosted both the Republican and the Democratic party conventions. Board memberships Greenfield's reputation for producing results placed him in high demand. He was involved or interested in almost everything, becoming known in his time as \\"Mr. Philadelphia\\". At one point in the 1940s, he sat on 43 boards. A few significant ones included the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company and successor Philadelphia Transportation Company (predecessors of SEPTA), Girard College, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Urban Land Institute, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the American Jewish Tercentenary Committee, the Sesquicentennial Exposition, Albert Einstein Medical Center, and the Federation of Jewish Charities. Philanthropy and legacy In the early 1950s, Greenfield donated $1 million to the University of Pennsylvania for creation of the Albert M. Greenfield Center for Human Relations, the nation's first institution specifically designed to train students to promote interfaith and interracial relations.Rottenberg, The Outsider, p. 212. In 1953, he established The Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to provide grants to a variety of local Philadelphia institutions. The Foundation has supported the Albert Monroe Greenfield Memorial Lecture in Human Relations, an annual event at the University of Pennsylvania held under the terms of the endowment of the Greenfield Professorship of Human Relations. The professorship was established in 1972.University of Pennsylvania, Jerry Lee Center of Criminology website (accessed Sep 1, 2008) . In 1992, the Foundation endowed The Albert M. Greenfield Student Competition, The Philadelphia Orchestra, to recognize extraordinary young musical talent in the Greater Delaware Valley region. The Foundation has also funded the Albert M. Greenfield Digital Imaging Center at The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and the digital and print Albert M. Greenfield Center for 20th-Century History at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Since 1984, the University of Pennsylvania has also hosted the Albert M. Greenfield Intercultural Center. Its original mission was \\"to provide support for student of color and to foster intercultural understanding on campus\\". Over the years the center has maintained this mission while expanding its programs. Sign installed by the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission, 2016, honoring Albert M. Greenfield; located on Walnut Street near the intersection with Juniper in Center City, Philadelphia His philanthropic endeavors transcended religious and racial lines. He was praised for his work by such organizations as the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the World Brotherhood Organization, the Urban League, and the Catholic Interracial Council. For his philanthropic work, he was bestowed with the rank of Commander of the Order of Pius IX by Pope Pius XI. He was the first Jew in America to receive such an honor. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission placed a marker honoring Greenfield near the corner of Walnut and Juniper Streets in Center City. The marker notes that Greenfield \\"supported equality for African Americans and received a papal award for promoting Catholic/Jewish harmony.\\" The Albert M. Greenfield Library is one of two libraries at The University of the Arts, on Broad Street in Center City Philadelphia. The Albert M. Greenfield Elementary School (part of the School District of Philadelphia), located at 22nd and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, is named in his honor. Greenfield died on January 5, 1967, at his estate, \\"Sugar Loaf\\", in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. He was survived by his third wife, the former Elizabeth Hallstrom, as well as five children (two sons and three daughters) from his first marriage, 21 grandchildren and two great- grandchildren. The Sugar Loaf estate remained in the hands of the Greenfield Foundation as its headquarters, and as the Albert M.

McAtee (July 8, 1928 ‚Äì April 8, 2005) was a Marine Corps officer, FBI agent, director of Kansas prisons, attorney, and Republican candidate for both Congress and Kansas Attorney General. Early life McAtee was born on July 8, 1928 to Lloyd M. McAtee and Grace V. Woodman. McAtee was raised two miles south of the Kansas-Nebraska border in Mahaska, a Washington County, Kansas town named by his grandfather. The Great Depression hit about a year after McAtee was born. Their lender foreclosed on the McAtee family farm. His family was able to save the farm by raising turkeys and sheep, selling butter, cottage cheese and produce. This experience seems to have shaped McAtee‚Äôs political views at an early age. McAtee graduated from Mahaska High School in 1946 and then enrolled at Washburn University. His parents helped him financially, but he earned cash by washing dishes in the school cafeteria and at the Kansas Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta, where he was a member. He also worked as a clerk at Helzberg's Jewelers and used some money he had saved from 4-H projects. In 2008, Phi Delta Theta announced a scholarship for Washburn students would bear his name.‚ÄúPhi Delta Theta Scholarship Honors Chuck McAtee‚Äù (Winter 2007). Washburn Alumni. Retrieved on August 30, 2007. McAtee graduated from Washburn with an undergraduate degree in political science and history on June 4, 1950. He also received a second lieutenant's commission in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. U.S. Marine Corps McAtee, who had been in the Platoon Leaders program at Washburn, said he joined the Marine reserves because he wanted to fight the spread of communism. Three weeks after he was commissioned, war broke out in Korea when the north attacked the south. McAtee, who was enrolled in law school, had to withdraw and went on active duty in October 1950. After receiving intensive training to become a combat lieutenant, he found himself in the Pusan Perimeter in South Korea, a tiny pocket of allied troops holding out against the North Koreans. At Pusan, he joined a line company in \\"G-3-7\\" ‚Äì George Company in the 3rd Battalion of the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. U.S. Marine Corps flag During one particularly intense engagement, McAtee earned the lifelong admiration of his fellow Marines. On April 23, 1951 McAtee and his 3rd platoon of 43 Marines fought and won against the Chinese and North Korean troops. The Marines had crossed the 38th Parallel to enter North Korea. His platoon was ordered to dig in on the reverse side of a ridge rather on than the crest, usually the preferred position. A regiment of Chinese troops came down on McAtee's platoon. The enemy came over the ridgeline and became disoriented because the Marines weren't where the Chinese thought they would be. McAtee coordinated fire and ran from place to place to keep the machine guns and the riflemen coordinated. Dr. Jim Nicholson, then a machine gunner in the platoon, later was quoted, ‚ÄúHe probably should have gotten a Navy Cross.\\" During that encounter, McAtee was wounded by mortar shrapnel in the left leg. After the Korean War, McAtee remained a committed supporter of his Marines. He was the legal officer for 1st Marine Division Association. He was also judge advocate for the General Lewis Walt Chapter of the Marine Corps League in Topeka and judge advocate of the Kansas Department of the Marine Corps League. McAtee was president of the Northeast Kansas Korean War Memorial, which was dedicated on July 4, 2003. McAtee was also a key supporter of the Topeka High School Junior ROTC program. He was also involved in the effort to clear the names and reinstate Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short who were demoted after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

In a Topeka Capital-Journal story years later when he was running for Kansas Attorney General, McAtee said he wanted to join the FBI because he fought in Korea to stop communism, and that war ended in a stalemate. \\"I wanted to continue the fight against international communism.\\" McAtee sought an assignment in New York to work in counterespionage, but instead was sent to Texas and later Montana. In 1957, McAtee told an FBI official he was unhappy with his assignments because he wasn't in counterespionage. Within two weeks, he got a letter of censure from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for his attitude and 30 days later received an honorable discharge as a captain from U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, which was arranged by the FBI against his will. McAtee remained in the FBI until December 31, 1959, when he resigned after being assigned to become a Polish-speaking FBI agent, which would have required him to stay in bureau for another four years. Legal career Following the FBI were stints as an assistant U.S. attorney in Kansas and the pardon and parole attorney and administrative assistant to Kansas Governor John Anderson. In the spring of 1961, McAtee was appointed the director of penal institutions (later renamed the secretary of corrections). As director, McAtee supervised the hanging executions of four men at Lansing State Penitentiary in April 1965. During his time as director of penal institutions, McAtee came to know Perry E. Smith and Richard E. Hickock, killers of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas who were slain on November 15, 1959. Smith and Hickock were immortalized in author Truman Capote's book In Cold Blood. McAtee left this position in 1969. After serving as director of penal institutions, McAtee worked a second stint in the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas starting in 1969, this time as the first assistant U.S. attorney. He entered private practice in 1970 and was a partner in Eidson, Lewis, Porter and Haynes, a Topeka law firm, until 1989 when it dissolved. He next served as an attorney of counsel in Schroer, Rice, Wisler & Morton. McAtee was one of two attorneys representing the Topeka school district when the Brown v. Board of Education case was reopened. After a six-week hearing in 1986 in U.S. District Court, District Judge Richard Rogers found the school district was substantially in compliance with the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended racial segregation in American schools. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision and sent the case back to Rogers, who monitored it for another 13 or 14 years. Rogers then ruled the school district was in compliance and that decision was accepted. During the course of his legal career, McAtee argued cases before the Kansas Court of Appeals, the Kansas Supreme Court and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was listed in Best Lawyers in America, under the category of business litigation, since it was first published in 1983 and was rated \\"AV,\\" the highest professional and ethical rating given, in the Martindale-Hubbell directory of attorneys in all states. Political Campaigns In the 1964 primary election, McAtee ran fourth among four Republican candidates seeking the party's nomination for the 2nd Congressional District. In the August 1968 primary election for the attorney general's office, McAtee ran fourth in a field of six Republicans. He took another stab at politics in 1972, when he again ran for the 2nd Congressional District seat. McAtee beat Joan Finney, then a Republican, in the primary election. In the general election, McAtee got 63,000 votes to Democrat Bill Roy's 101,000 votes. He ran for the Republican nomination for Kansas Attorney General in 2002 finishing third.

The prince is presented and invested with the insignia of his rank and dignity, in the manner of a coronation. An investiture is purely ceremonial, as the title is created via letters patent. Investitures fell into abeyance and the revival of investing the Prince of Wales in 1911 was largely due to David Lloyd George's instigation. A similar ceremony was also held in 1969 for Queen Elizabeth II's son and heir, Prince Charles. History Edward I and Edward II The tradition of investing the heir apparent of the English, and subsequently the British, monarch with the title of \\"Prince of Wales\\" began in 1301, when King Edward I of England, having completed the conquest of Wales, gave the title to his heir apparent, Prince Edward (later King Edward II of England). Form Investiture is not necessary for the official appointment Prince of Wales. Earlier, peers were also invested; however, the investitures for peers ceased in 1621, at a time when peerages were being created so frequently that the investiture ceremonies became cumbersome. Most investitures for Princes of Wales were held in parliament. Modern form In 1911, the future King Edward VIII was invested in Caernarfon Castle in Wales. The present Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, was also invested there in 1969. The ceremony in 1969 began with Prince Charles, led by the regalia bearers, entering the Chamberlain Tower, to await the arrival of Her Majesty. Once the royal family had arrived, the lesser members took their seats in the gallery, but the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, led by the Earl of Snowdon, the Lord Great Chamberlain, the Earl Marshal and the Gentleman Usher carrying the Great Sword of State, made their way to the stage where the investiture was to be conducted. After reaching the podium, where the Secretary of State for Wales, carrying the letters patent, was already standing, the Earl Marshal instructed Garter to conduct the Prince and his cort√®ge from the tower. As they came to the stage Prince Charles knelt before the three thrones on the stage. During the reading of the letters patent in Welsh, the Queen invested Charles with the girdle, sword, coronet, ring, rod and kingly mantle, in that order. Prince Charles then declared, \\"I, Charles, Prince of Wales, do become your liege man of life and limb and of earthly worship, and faith and truth I will bear unto thee, to live and die against all manner of folks.\\" Charles then customarily kissed the Queen's cheek and they embraced. Charles then took his place in the throne at his mother's right, before standing to give two speeches, one in Welsh and one in English. A brief religious service was then conducted and the Queen led the Prince of Wales to Queen Eleanor's Gate, to receive the homage of his adopted nation. The numerous banners and standards of the Prince of Wales were hung from the balcony. The letters patent stated that Charles Philip Arthur George would receive the title, style, honour and privilege of the Principality of Wales and Earldom of Chester. Regalia During the reading of the letters patent creating the Prince, the Honours of the Principality of Wales are delivered to the Prince. The coronet of the heir apparent bears four crosses patt√©es alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by a single arch (the Sovereign's crowns are of the same design, but use two arches). A gold rod is also used in the insignia; gold rods were formerly used in the investitures of dukes, but survive now in the investitures of Princes of Wales only. Also part of the insignia are a ring, a girdle, a sword and a robe. Coronets Llywelyn the Last wearing his coronet It is recorded that Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had deposited his coronet along with his other regalia with the monks at Cymer Abbey for safekeeping at the start of his final campaign in 1282. He was killed later that year. It was seized and presented to King Edward I of England as a token of the complete annihilation of the independent Welsh state. Frederick, Prince of Wales, later had the Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales, made at a cost of ¬£140 5s. in 1728. It is unknown whether Frederick ever wore the coronet himself, but it was used by both his son, George III, and his grandson, George IV, when each was Prince of Wales. Due to its age Frederick's coronet was replaced by the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales, made for the future King George V. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. When the former King Edward VIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 (following his abdication), he took with him the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales, a highly controversial ‚Äì and illegal ‚Äì act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, then Prince of Wales, and he wore it at his father's coronation in 1902. The traditional coronet being unavailable, and with the older Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales being viewed unusable due to age, a new Prince of Wales coronet was made to be used for the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales. The Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales, was produced by a committee under Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, then husband of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. Investiture of Prince Charles A large protest against the holding of the investiture in Caernarfon took place in March 1969 Prince Charles, 30 June 1969 Prince Charles was made the Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester by letters patent on 26 July 1958, but the official investiture was not held until 1 July 1969. The ceremony, at Caernarfon Castle, was well received by many Welsh people. Some nationalists, though, viewed it as being associated with the subjugation of Welsh people since the 13th century, when king Edward I of England deposed the last native Prince of Wales, . Previous investitures had taken place at various locations, including the Palace of Westminster, the seat of Parliament. The Welsh borough of Swansea was granted city status to mark the occasion. Taught by Welsh-nationalist politician Edward Millward, Prince Charles spent ten weeks leading up to his investiture learning about Welsh culture, history and language, and during the ceremony he gave his replies in both English and Welsh. The investiture was watched by millions on television, and attracted large and excited crowds in Caernarfon, but it also aroused considerable hostility among a minority of nationalist and republican Welsh people. The nationalist campaign against the investiture culminated with an attempted bombing by two members of the ('Movement for the Defence of Wales'). On the eve of the investiture two bombers were killed whilst placing a bomb outside government offices in Abergele. In recent years, it has been claimed that the KGB plotted to disrupt the proceedings by bombing a bridge in Porthmadog. In recent opinion polls, the majority of Welsh people (usually cited as over 60 per cent) have remained in favour of the monarchy, with a BBC Wales poll in 1999 finding that 73 per cent of Welsh speakers want the position of Prince of Wales to continue. A BBC poll, to mark the 40th anniversary of the investiture, showed that 38 per cent of the Welsh population was in favour of a similar public ceremony for Prince William after Prince Charles becomes king. A poll in July 2018 again found the majority of Welsh people in support of the title passing on when the current prince becomes king, but 47 percent objected to another investiture. On the evening of 28 June 2009‚Äîto commemorate the 40th anniversary of the investiture‚ÄîBBC Parliament broadcast a repeat of the original BBC TV colour outside broadcast from 1 July 1969, fronted by Cliff Michelmore and Richard Baker. This was preceded by an interview with Prince Charles recorded a few days before his investiture. The BBC repeated the broadcast on 1 July 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary.

Under the direction of Roy Hart, the Roy Hart Theatre evolved into a group of performers who devised and presented experimental performances noted for the way the members utilized extended vocal technique to create verbal and nonverbal drama and music, which had a substantial influence on the work of notable contemporaries of the European avant garde, including Peter Brook who subsequently incorporated extended vocal technique into his productions, Jerzy Grotowski, who made vocal expression a central feature to his rehearsal techniques and performances, Karlheinz Stockhausen who adapted works for Hart, and Peter Maxwell Davies who composed Eight Songs for a Mad King especially for Roy Hart's voice.

Roy Hart died in 1974, shortly after the Roy Hart Theatre moved permanently from London to Mal√©rargues, Southern France. However, the remaining members continued the work begun by Alfred Wolfsohn and extended by Hart, through teaching extended vocal technique and staging dramatic and musical performances that utilized a vocal range and flexibility greater than that commonly heard in speech and song.Newham, P.

Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre Alfred Wolfsohn was a Jewish German who suffered auditory hallucinations of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying whilst serving as a stretcher bearer in the trenches of World War I. He was subsequently diagnosed with shell shock, and after failing to benefit from psychiatry, hypnosis, and medication, cured himself by vocalizing the extreme sounds he had heard and later hallucinated, before developing an approach to singing lessons intended to be therapeutic for his students.G√ºnther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn', Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, 50: pp65‚Äì75, 1990.Wolfsohn, A., Die Br√ºcke.

Wolfsohn developed and taught techniques that were originally intended as psychotherapeutic, to a regular group of students, some of whom studied with him for almost twenty years, at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre in Berlin from 1935 to 1939 and in London from 1943 until 1962 when he died. Among these students was Roy Hart, who began studying with Wolfsohn in 1947.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2‚Äì7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985. Experimental music and theatre As a consequence of Wolfsohn's extended vocal technique, his students developed highly flexible and expressive voices, some of them in excess of five octaves.Luchsinger, R. and Dubois, C.L., 'Phonetische und stroboskopische Unters√ºchungen an einem Stimmph√§nomen', Folia Phoniatrica, 8: No. 4, pp201‚Äì210. Trans. Ian Halcrow. 1956. During the three years prior to Wolfsohn's death, this group of students began to demonstrate the artistic use of their vocal expressiveness in vocal music, poetry, and drama, to invited guests. After Alfred Wolfsohn died, Roy Hart expanded upon this tradition, acting as stage director and performer in theatre productions that used a range of vocal expression beyond that employed in most Western drama and music performances of that time.Roose-Evans J., Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook, 4th edn. London: Routledge, 1989.Newham, P., The Singing Cure: An Introduction to Voice Movement Therapy. London: Random House, 1993 and Boston: Shambhala, 1994. Background Roy Hart studied English and Psychology at the Witwatersrand University, Johannesburg before coming to England to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He records: > I came to England from South Africa‚Ä¶I won a scholarship to RADA and was told > I had a good voice and stage personality. Yet I had known for some time that > my voice was not rooted, not literally embodied... On leaving RADA I was > immediately offered a most promising opening in the Theatre‚Ä¶I made an > extraordinary choice. I turned down the proffered 'big chance' in order to > research into the nature and meaning of the human voice.Hart, R., How Voice > Gave me a Conscience.

Roy Hart began taking lessons with Alfred Wolfsohn in 1947. Upon his teacher's death in 1962 the long-standing attendants of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre divided with Hart taking leadership of one group who were joined by students of Hart's acting lessons whilst the other group continued their attempts to maintain the centre and its therapeutic focus.

The papers presented by Hart made two fundamental points. :* Firstly, they proposed that an extended vocal range could be used to produce a form of theatre that returned it to its alleged routes in religious ritual and spiritual practice.Innes, C. (1981) Holy Theatre: Ritual and the Avant Garde. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Innes, C. (1993) Avant Garde Theatre 1892‚Äì'. London: Routledge.Schechner, R. (1985) Between Theatre and Anthropology. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. The vision of reviving a primitive and provocative participatory theatre that would use a range of vocal sounds to portray mythical characters and deities, and express intense human emotion was synonymous with Jerzy Grotowski's vision of creating a theatre that made full use of the voice to embody archetypal themes. Furthermore, both Hart and Grotowski agreed that theatre should provoke and stir what Carl Jung called the collective unconscious through such portrayal.Flaszen, L.

London: Routledge. :* Secondly, Hart, citing Alfred Wolfsohn, suggested that the process of individuation at the heart of Analytical Psychology developed by Carl Jung could be achieved artistically and acoustically through singing, as much as through the speaking that remained central to the practice of psychotherapy, which commonly revolves around a verbal conversation, originally named the Talking Cure by Sigmund Freud.G√ºnther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn', Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture, 50: pp65‚Äì75, 1990.Hart, R., Context.

Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Mal√©rargues, France. This attracted the attention and recruited the support of psychologists, psychiatrists, and other clinicians, including Paul Moses, and contributed to the development of the therapeutic use of arts in clinical settings, including the expressive arts therapies, particularly drama therapy and music therapy.Mitchell, S., 'Therapeutic theatre: a para-theatrical model of dramatherapy.'

Levine (eds) Foundations of Expressive Therapy: Theoretical and Clinical Perspectives. London. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, pp 89 -112. For the first few years following Wolfsohn's death, Hart continued seeking to gain recognition of nonverbal vocalization, drama, and experimental vocal music as an efficacious form of psychotherapy,Sheppard, L., An Empirical Therapy Based on an Extension of Vocal Range and Expression in Singing and Drama. Paper read at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy, London, August 1964. and in 1965, members of the Roy Hart Theatre began working with patients at Shenley Psychiatric Hospital, St. Albans in Hertfordshire.G√ºnther, M., The Human Voice, Paper read at the National Conference on Drama Therapy, Antioch University, San Francisco, November 1986. However, during the ten years after Wolfsohn's death, the emphasis of the Roy Hart Theatre shifted substantially towards performing arts, and the potential therapeutic benefits of singing and vocalizing became subsidiary and secondary to the work and vision of Hart's company.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2‚Äì7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985. In 1985 Paul Newham began vocal training with Roy Hart Theatre member Enrique Pardo, learning techniques derived from Wolfsohn and Hart. Newham subsequently collaborated with Leslie Sheppard in analysing the written, phonographic, and photographic documentation that the archivist had curated at the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Newham later reformulated and expanded some of the techniques established by Alfred Wolfsohn and furthered by Hart, proposing the foundations for a form of expressive therapy based on the use of song, prayer, and other forms of vocal expression. Newham's expansion upon Wolfsohn's and Hart's work was to some degree appropriated into the expressive therapies,Hall S, An Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential of Song in Dramatherapy.

At the time of Wolfsohn's, Hart's and Newham's work, there was scant scientific research into the clinical use of singing, whist today there is some evidence to indicate the possible rehabilitative and therapeutic application of nonverbal musical vocalization with some populations.Wan CY, R√ºber T, Hohmann A, Schlaug G.

Nonetheless, this field of inquiry is in its infancy even now, and in the face of little opportunity to further Wolfsohn's original vision of 'singing as therapy', Hart steered the group towards artistic application of extended vocal technique. Performances When Hart began teaching acting classes in London, he appropriated adaptations of Wolfsohn's extended vocal technique and also introduced and developed his own physical exercises that involved extensive bodily movement. These exercises became part of the training and rehearsal process undertaken by Roy Hart's theatre company, leading to performances that were often described as an example of physical theatre.

Dartington Theatre Papers, Fifth Series, No. 14, ed. by David Williams. Series ed. by Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts In 1965 the Roy Hart Theatre company began rehearsing a performance of the Bacchae, and having met Philip Vellacott, used his translation. Initial presentations of the Bacchae were attended by Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, R.D. Laing, Irene Worth, Jean Louis Barrault, and Peter Maxwell Davies.Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65. Maxwell Davies subsequently composed a full length piece for Roy Hart called Eight Songs for a Mad King. The world premier of this piece was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 22 April 1969, with subsequent performances given internationally. In a review of Eight Songs for a Mad King in the newspaper Die Welt, Heinz Joachim said: > Roy Hart is an artist who commands not only all the voices of the human > register ‚Äì ranging from the deepest bass to the highest soprano, but also > (incredibly enough) the ability to produce several sounds simultaneously; > added to which he gives an acting performance which stretches from the most > tender allusiveness to the most macabre realism. All this is (as banal as > the formulation may sound) simply phenomenal, unique, sensational. Yet it > lay beyond all 'sensation'. It was so deeply stamped by immediate > experience; it was the art of presentation which, at every moment, uses the > means available in a conscious way, and yet never transgresses the > borderline that leads to trash...the solo part is specifically written for > Roy Hart. Probably no other artist could realise this part so > penetratingly.Joachim, H, (newspaper), Die Welt, 20 October 1969. Between 1969 and 1974, Roy Hart presented the world premier of a work composed especially for him by Hans Werner Henze entitled Versuch √ºber Schweine, performed with the English Chamber Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. He also performed a piece by Karlheinz Stockhausen called Spiral, which the composer adapted for Hart's voice.Pikes, N.

Reviewing a performance at the Round House, Herbert Kretzmer wrote in the Daily Express newspaper: > On an enormous poster on the walls of the Round House are painted the words: > 'Language is dead. Long live the voice.'

Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Mal√©rargues, France. In addition to London-based performances, Roy Hart performed pieces at festivals and venues in Spain, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Some were solo performances by Hart, others used the whole Roy Hart Theatre troupe, including Mariage de Lux by Serge B√©har, and Ich Bin by Paul P√∂rtner, both works especially written for the group. The Roy Hart Theatre also collaborated with some of the actors from Peter Brook's troupe in a devised performance.Roose-Evans J., Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavsky to Peter Brook, 4th edn. London: Routledge, 1989.Schechner, R. (1994) Performance Theory. London: Routledge. In Lettres Fran√ßaises under the title of \\"Voice and Madness ‚Äì Echo of the Origin of Man\\", Catherine Cl√©ment described her experience of witnessing a performance by the Roy Hart Theatre as like being in the presence of the unconscious. Back√®s-Cl√©ment, C., \\"Voice and Madness; Echo of the Origin of Man\\", Lettres Fran√ßaises (magazine), 1979. Move to France Le chateau de Mal√©rargues In the summer of 1974, the group of performers known as The Roy Hart Theatre, which included some who like Hart had worked with Alfred Wolfsohn for many years, as well as others who had studied acting with Hart, moved to the Chateau de Mal√©rargues, in Thoiras, near Saint-Jean-du-Gard, in southern France intending to establish a permanent rehearsal studio, theatre, and training school to explore further the artistic application of the extended vocal technique. A year later, Roy Hart, along with his wife and a third member of the troupe, died in a car accident. However, the group retained the name Roy Hart Theatre, and continued to perform locally, nationally, and internationally, as well as teaching extended vocal technique to actors and singers.Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65. The work continues today through successive generations of teachers and students at what is now called the Centre International Artistique Roy Hart.

With the creation and official opening of a new football field in 1933, VASK was disestablished, and in its place was created in October 1933 a new club, SK Bata. Between 1933 and 1939 the club competed in the regional league of Osijek. In 1939, after winning their provincial league they earned the first ever opportunity to play at national level.

Her tales, described as \\"reminiscent in their fantastic blend of realism, myth, and superstition of writers like Rulfo, Garcia Marquez, even Tutuola,\\" frequently take as their setting the small, remote village in southern Iran where she was born. Nahid Mozaffari, editor of Strange Times, My Dear: The International PEN Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature, wrote that Ravanipour \\"has been successful in the treatment of the complex subjects of tradition and modernity, juxtaposing elements of both, and exposing them in all their contradictions without idealizing either.\\" Ravanipour was among seventeen activists to face trial in Iran for their participation in the 2000 Berlin Conference, accused of taking part in anti-Iran propaganda. Copies of her current work were recently stripped from bookstore shelves in Iran in a countrywide police action. She is a former Brown University International Writers Project Fellow. Early life Moniro Ravanipour was born on 1952, in Bushehr, South of Iran. She lived in Bushehr till she was 17, and moved to Shiraz for Pahlavi Private High school. She joined Shiraz Pahlavi University in 1972 and studied Chemistry, and then changed major and took a degree in psychology. She started theatre in Bushehr and joined the Theater and Literary Society of Bushehr. Acting and theatre experience Moniro joined a theatre group in Bushehr called The Theatre and Literary Society of Bushehr. In 1967 Moniro acted in Mother, A play by Manouchehr Atashi. She then continued to act and participated in the production of several plays in Shiraz. Moniro worked with a group of college students for a play called Abazar Ghafari which was banned later. In 1975 she joined Shiraz Theatre Group for producing a play named Moalem, by Shapour Jowrkesh, and in 1976 participated in Tous Theatre Festival, and worked with Shapour Jowrkesh again, for a play named Khoubchehr. Post revolution In early post-revolution years she was involved in political activities and was banned from studying. During these years, her brother was executed, all her sister were banned from education in elementary and high school, one of her sisters and her husband were sentenced to death penalty and escaped Iran, one of her brothers-in-law got arrested several times. For a decade, she couldn't have a stable place of residence due to the mentioned situation, and she moved from one place to another. She wrote her first short story collection in 1977 named The Sparrow and Mr. President, which was immediately banned from publishing and collected from shelves. After their house was attacked and pillaged in Bushehr, her family moved to Shiraz, and then Moniro moved to Tehran and using a fake name, worked as a worker in Daroupakhsh Factory. After her true identity was revealed using another fake name she worked for another six months in Amidi Factory. Later she worked the grave yard shift nurse in a private hospital, again using a fake name. In 1983 Moniro went back to Shiraz to visit her parents, and she got arrested on the street, when the regime was doing the random arrest of the citizens. It was during the terrible prison days that she decided to become a writer of big fame and success when she is free again, so she would not get killed and forgotten like many others were. Writing career Moniro started writing again from 1965, and wrote children's books and screen plays. A year after Iran‚ÄìIraq War, she went to the City Khanaqin boundaries, for writing a novel about war using the identity of a martyr's mother. After 1988 Moniro published her works using her real name and in 1994 for the first time she was invited the Women's studies Organization of Vienna. Later she was invited for speeches to 21 countries, and then she was invited by: Khaneh Farhanghaye Jahan, Goethe-Institut, Literary Center of Gumusluk, Bodrum, Gothenburg expo in Sweden, Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, in Germany, France, and the U.S. Style She is famous for using magic realism, but the truth is that she uses the bitter reality she found in the happenings and real life in her homeland. Despite the bold use of surrealism and magical realism, she uses realism too. The settings of her stories are not just the rural world, but her work pictures life and culture in the urban life as well. In 2006 she moved to the U.S. getting a scholarship in Brown university and then at UNLV's Black Mountain Institute's City of Asylum as a visiting author for three years. During her stay in the U.S. she has gone to Sacramento, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Providence, for lectures and speeches. Her short stories have been translated into: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Kurdish, Polish (by Ivonna Nowicka), Swedish, Turkish.

History In 1935, the National Association of Free Will Baptists (NAFWB) selected Rev. Winford Davis of Missouri to become the first Sunday School Secretary. Only three years later, the NAFWB elected the first Sunday School Board, which developed the National Sunday School Convention (NSSC) in 1940. Since 1940, the work of the Sunday School Board has been promoted via the NSSC. In order to increase participation, the Sunday School Board brought back that work under the direct supervision of the Board in 1947. In 1950, the NSSC voted to dissolve as a separate entity.NAFWB Minutes, 1951, pg 45. The NAFWB launched their own Free Will Baptist-produced Sunday School literature program in 1958. It was shut down in 1959 due to financial difficulties and was reopened in 1962. In 1962, Roger Reeds became the first full-time General Director of the Sunday School Department (SS Department). In 1972 the SS Department adopted Randall House Publications as their trade name in honor of Benjamin Randall, the founder of the Northern line of Free Will Baptists. In 1994, Dr. Roger Reeds retired, and Dr. Alton Loveless became the new Executive Director. In 2002, Loveless retired, and Ron Hunter Jr. became the third Executive Director and CEO of Randall House Publications.

Life  He spent most of his life working in France. He moved to Paris in 1776, and entered the service of the Duke of Montmorency and then of the Count of Valentinois as a horn player. He composed a great number of orchestral and chamber works but is best remembered for his oratorio Jepht√©, performed at the Concert Spirituel in September 1781, and for his two operas. Although his music was received favourably, his works never became extremely popular because they were deemed as 'too complicated and baroque'. Vogel was an enthusiast for the operas of Gluck, and his first opera, La toison d'or, is dedicated to the composer as 'l√©gislateur de la musique'. In places it appears to be a faithful stylistic imitation of Gluck's two Iphigenia operas, Iphig√©nie en Tauride and Iphigenie auf Tauris , but with a fuller orchestration and a greater lyricism in the arias. The opera was written in 1781 but was not performed until 5 September 1786 at the Op√©ra National de Paris. It played for only 12 performances and was met with limited success since it seemed old-fashioned and contained no ballet. Philippe Desriaux, for many years the secretary of Baron von Tschudi, wrote the librettos for both La toison d'or and Vogel‚Äôs second opera, D√©mophon. Its posthumous premi√®re (at the Op√©ra on 22 September 1789) was given only after the premi√®re of Cherubini's opera on the same subject. Among the musical qualities of this work are the variety of recitative forms, the treatment of the woodwind as solo instruments and the harmonic colour of the choruses. The overture, composed in monothematic sonata form, remained popular into the early 19th century, and was incorporated into Pierre Gardel's ballet- pantomime Psych√© (1790), which had more than 1000 performances at the Op√©ra National de Paris between its premi√®re and 1829.

Lemnaru left Sportul Studen≈£esc to join Politehnica Timi»ôoara in 2001. In 2003, due to salary issues, he refused to play for Politehnica Timi»ôoara and he was suspended by the team owner, Claudio Zambon, for almost two years. During the suspension he worked at the A2 motorway (Romania). In 2005, with the help of Lehliu's mayor, who paid Zambon the player's transfer fee, Lemnaru returned to his home town team and he was soon transferred to DunƒÉrea CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi. In 2006 Lemnaru joined Dinamo Bucure≈üti. He played mostly for the reserves team of the club but he made one appearance at the first team with whom he won the 2006‚Äì07 Liga I title. In January 2009 he was loaned to Astra Ploie≈üti and later that year Lemnaru was transferred by the second league team Universitatea Cluj. He scored 16 goals for Universitatea Cluj in one and a half seasons and after the team promoted in Liga I, the striker was loaned to Pandurii T√¢rgu Jiu. Later he was definitively transferred to Pandurii T√¢rgu Jiu where he played until September 2013, scoring 15 goals in 71 matches. With Pandurii he managed to finish the 2012‚Äì13 Liga I season on the second place, thus leading to the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Europa League qualification. Lemnaru returned at Universitatea Cluj for whom he scored 13 goals in the 2013‚Äì14 Liga I season. He had a significant contribution to saving the team from relegation, being the top scorer of Universitatea Cluj and the second highest scorer of 2013‚Äì14 Liga I season. Roumors appeared that Lemnaru could be called to play for the Romania national football team, or the Moldova national football team but none were concretized. In July 2014, Lemnaru signed a contract for two years with the Romanian champions Steaua Bucure»ôti. He made his debut for Steaua in a UEFA Champions League game against FC Aktobe. But this remained his only game for Steaua, and in September 2014 he was sold back to Universitatea Cluj where he signed a two-year deal.

Background  It is not known when Wang Yu was born. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Wang Fangqing, who served as a chancellor during the reign of Wu Zetian. His intervening ancestors' names were recorded as Wang Jiao (), Wang Chong (), Wang Zhonglian (), and Wang Shao (), none of whom was recorded to have carried any official titles except for Wang Jiao who served as prefect of Lu Prefecture and Wang Zhonglian who served as a secretarial officer at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu).New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Wang Yu himself was said to be well-studied in the worshipping of gods and spirits and particularly paid attention to the proper times to offer sacrifices.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Toward the end of the Kaiyuan era (713-742) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong was paying great attention to Taoist doctrines and ceremonies. Wang Yu made a submission to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that an altar, to be called the Spring Altar (Êò•Â£á, Chun Tan), be built to the east of the capital Chang'an and dedicated to the Blue Emperor (ÈùíÂ∏ù, Qing Di). Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and he made Wang an official-scholar at the ministry of worship (Â§™Â∏∏ÂØ∫, Taichang Si) and an imperial censor (‰æçÂæ°Âè≤, Shiyushi), as well as a special emissary of worship (Á•†Á•≠‰Ωø, Ciji Shi). It was said that Wang drew favors from the emperor due to his dedication to worshipping gods on Emperor Xuanzong's behalf. It was further said that while previously, the common populace already had a custom of sacrificing joss paper to the spirits, it was Wang who brought this custom into official ceremonies.New Book of Tang, vol. 109.  During Emperor Suzong's and Emperor Daizong's reigns  After Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong became emperor in 756, Wang Yu was promoted to be the minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). Because his worship of the gods pleased Emperor Suzong, Emperor Suzong often gave him rewards. In 758, when Emperor Suzong removed the chancellors Cui Yuan and Li Lin from their posts, he made Wang Zhongshu Shilang () -- the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. It was said that even before this, Wang did not have a good reputation among the people, and after he was made chancellor, his reputation grew worse due to his incompetence. At Wang's suggestion, Emperor Suzong built an altar dedicated to the god Taiyi (Â§™‰∏Ä or Â§™‰πô) to the south of Chang'an. Around this time, Emperor Suzong was ill, and the fortunetellers told him that he was being cursed by a god of a mountain or a river. Wang thus suggested that a group of witches and eunuchs be commissioned to go to various mountains and rivers of the empire to pray for Emperor Suzong. The witches that Wang selected used this opportunity to extort bribes from the local officials. One of them, who was sent to Huang Prefecture (ÈªÉÂ∑û, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), took an entourage of several tens of young hoodlums with her and stayed at the station for imperial messengers with them. When the prefect of Huang Prefecture, Zuo Zhen (), visited in the morning, he found the station door locked. He became angry, and he ordered that his police officers break into the station and that the witch be dragged out to be decapitated. He also killed the hoodlums that she was with, and then confiscated the bribes that they were carrying. He submitted the funds to Emperor Suzong and requested that the funds be used to pay the taxes that the people of Huang Prefecture would otherwise be responsible for. Emperor Suzong accepted the funds but did not punish Wang. In 759, indeed, pursuant to Wang's suggestions, he personally offered sacrifices to the gods of the nine palaces (‰πùÂÆÆÁ•û, Jiugong Shen). Later that year, however, he made Wang the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu) and removed him from the chancellor position. In 760, Wang was made the prefect of Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), as well as the military governor (jiedushi) of the surrounding prefectures. In 761, Wang was made the secretary general at Yang Prefecture as well as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, i.e., the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River). After an occasion after Emperor Suzong offered sacrifices, he made Wang the governor of Yue Prefecture (Ë∂äÂ∑û, roughly modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) as well as the military governor of Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, i.e., the region east of the Qiantang River). Sometime thereafter, he was recalled to serve as Taizi Shaobao () and then Taizi Shaoshi () -- both positions advisorial positions to the crown prince.However, as the historical accounts did not give the timing for these movements -- or, for that matter, even under which emperor these movements occurred, it is not known whether Wang thus served as an advisor to Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Yu (the later Emperor Daizong) or Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo. Wang died in 768, during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong. He was buried with honors and given the posthumous name Jianhuai (Á∞°Êá∑, meaning \\"undiscriminating and just\\"). His great-grandson Wang Tuan later served as a chancellor near the end of Tang Dynasty, under Emperor Zhaozong.

The genus currently consists of 12 described species. They are best known for their dense toxic algal blooms and red tides that cause considerable ecological and economical damage; some Karenia species cause severe animal mortality. One species, Karenia brevis, is known to cause respiratory distress and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) in humans. Taxonomy The genus Karenia is named for Dr. Karen Steidinger for her exceptional contributions to dinoflagellate research. She has spent many decades researching Karenia brevis. 12 species have been described in the genus Karenia thus far: * Karenia asterichroma * Karenia bicuneiformis * Karenia brevis * Karenia brevisulcata * Karenia concordia * Karenia cristata * Karenia digitata * Karenia longicanalis * Karenia mikimotoi * Karenia papilionacea * Karenia selliformis * Karenia umbella History of knowledge Characteristic fish killings described by 15th and 16th century Spanish explorers were likely the earliest recorded sightings of Karenia. Other major fish killings were documented in 1844 off of the coast of Florida. Oda, in 1935, was the first to name any species in what is now the genus Karenia: Gymnodinium mikimotoi but was later renamed Karenia mikimotoi. Davis in 1948 was the first to document that the cause of the fish kills was the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium breve, which was renamed Ptychodiscus brevis and since 2001 is now known as Karenia brevis. Description Karenia are naked, flat, unicellular, photosynthetic cells that are quite pleomorphic: size tends to range from about 20‚Äì90 um. The cell contains a straight apical groove, and differences in apical grooves (acrobases) are often used to distinguish between species. Thecal plates are not present. The cell body can be divided into an episome and a hyposome like other dinoflagellates. Two dissimilar flagella that are involved in locomotion are present in the cingulum and sulcus. The cytoplasm contains many yellow-green chloroplasts. The plastid of Karenia is especially notable as it is the product of tertiary endosymbiosis, by uptake of a haptophyte. Therefore, they lack the typical dinoflagellate pigment peridinin and have a plastid with pigments chlorophylls a+c and 19‚Ä≤-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, typically haptophyte pigments. A nucleus is also found in the cell and its location and shape can distinguish between species. Habitat and ecology Karenia is found throughout the world in both oceanic and coastal waters. It is relatively sporadic in abundance, but it can form large blooms in the summer or fall which can have severe ecological and economical consequences. These blooms are generally referred to as harmful algal blooms (HABs), but are also sometimes referred to as red tides. Karenia is known to divide very slowly, but are able to form dense blooms probably due to their ability to swim quickly, which likely allows them access to higher concentrations of nutrients. Many of these blooms consist of more than one type of Karenia species. The cause of the blooms is still poorly understood. When a large bloom occurs, resources become limited, and this means greater competition for space and sunlight between several marine organisms‚Äîas the genus Karenia start dying they release their neurotoxins, which can kill fish and other organisms. The dense blooms can also cause animal mortalities through anoxia. Karenia brevis also causes distress in humans in the form of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) which gets biomagnified up the food chain. Karenia species produce a variety of toxins, with many probably producing more than one. Karenia are considered autotrophic organisms primarily, but some have been found to be mixotrophic as they can ingest microbes as well. Microbes have also been seen to be capable of attacking Karenia species, although their role in population dynamics is not well understood. Biology Life cycle Although the genus Karenia consists of 12 described species, most research on life cycles has been done on Karenia brevis which will be outlined here. Karenia follow the typical life cycle of a dinoflagellate with a motile, haploid, asexual cell with regular mitotic divisions. This binary fission reproduction occurs once about every 2‚Äì10 days, and division occurs primarily at night (Brand et al., 2012). They occasionally produce diploid planozygotes (mobile zygotes) implying they are capable of sexual reproduction. They have been observed to be in what appears to be the process of conjugation, a type of unicellular sexual reproduction. They can enter a hypnozygote cyst stage, which is an often thick walled, resting cyst that results from sexual fusion. This occurs when environmental conditions are adverse and allows it to be dormant and spread to grow algal blooms elsewhere. Genetics Karenia, like all organisms in the dinoflagellate group, are characteristic for their unique permanently condensed chromatin that lacks nucleosomes and histones. The less tightly packed loops of DNA consist of actively transcribed DNA. The haploid genome is large (about 30 times the size of humans), and usually contain a large quantity of repetitive, non-coding DNA. They also portray a unique mitosis where the nuclear envelope stays intact and the mitotic spindle has extra nuclear microtubules that go through the nucleus through cytoplasmic channels. The genome of Karenia brevis is estimated to be about 1 x 10^11 bp, although the genome has not been sequenced in any members of this genus. Toxicity Karenia are well known for their toxic blooms that kill fish, marine organisms, and other animals. These blooms, also called red tides, cause extensive ecological and economic damage. What causes these harmful algal blooms is still poorly understood. Karenia brevis is of particular importance to humans because it also can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) and respiratory distress through accumulation of toxins in tissue. These toxins are taken up by molluscs with no detrimental effects, but they distress the humans who ingest the molluscs. The distress is caused by neurotoxins called brevetoxins. Brevetoxins are lipid soluble and capable of biomagnification up the food chain. They work by activating voltage-sensitive sodium channels and causing them to remain open for excessive amounts of time, which leads to uncontrolled depolarization of the neural membrane. This results in persistent neuron firing. No deaths have been recorded in association with brevetoxin, but severe effects have been noted, such as nausea, vomiting, and slurred speech.

It currently operates as an apartment building known as Herald Towers. History The Hotel McAlpin was constructed in 1912 by General Edwin A. McAlpin, son of David Hunter McAlpin. When opened it was the largest hotel in the world. The hotel was designed by the noted architect Frank Mills Andrews (1867‚Äì1948). Andrews also was president of the Greeley Square Hotel Company which first operated the hotel. Construction of the Hotel McAlpin neared completion by the end of 1912 so that the hotel had an open house on 29 December. The largest hotel in the world at the time, The New York Times commented that it was so tall at 25 stories that it ‚Äúseems isolated from other buildings‚Äù Boasting a staff of 1,500, the hotel could accommodate 2,500 guests. It was built at a cost of $13.5 million ($ today). The top floor had a Turkish bath and there were two gender-specific floors; women checking into the hotel could reserve a room on the women's only floor and bypass the lobby and check in directly at their own floor. One floor, dubbed the ‚Äúsleepy 16th‚Äù was designed for night workers so that it was kept quiet during the day. It also hosted a travel agency. The hotel underwent an expansion half a decade later. The owners had purchased an additional 50 feet of frontage on 34th street two years early and proceeded to dismantle those properties. The new addition was the same height as the original 25-story building, and was expected to provide an additional 200 rooms, four more elevators, and a large ballroom. A major refurbishment costing $2.1 million was completed in 1928 refreshing the rooms, installing modern bathrooms and updating the elevators. The McAlpin family sold the hotel in 1938 to Jamlee Hotels, headed by Joseph Levy, president of Crawford Cloths, a prominent real estate investor in New York for $5,400,000. Jamlee reportedly invested an additional $1,760,000 in renovations. During the Jamlee ownership, the hotel was managed by the Knott Hotel Chain until 1952 when management was taken over by Tisch. On October 15, 1954, Jamlee sold the hotel to Sheraton Hotels for $9,000,000 and it was renamed the Sheraton-McAlpin. Sheraton completely renovated the hotel five years later and renamed it the Sheraton-Atlantic Hotel on October 8, 1959. Sheraton sold the hotel to the investing partnership of Sol Goldman and Alexander DiLorenzo on July 28, 1968 for $7.5 million and it reverted to the Hotel McAlpin name. Sheraton briefly reacquired the hotel in 1976, through a default by the buyers, and quickly sold it to developer William Zeckendorf, Jr. who converted the McAlpin to 700 rental apartments. During the housing bubble, the building attempted to convert to condominiums but ultimately failed. It is currently a rental building known as Herald Towers. Notable events On Christmas Eve 1916, Harry K. Thaw, former husband of Evelyn Nesbit and the murderer of Stanford White, attacked 19-year- old Fred Gump, Jr. in a large suite on the 18th Floor. Thaw had enticed Gump to New York with a promise of a job but instead sexually assaulted him and beat him repeatedly with a stocky whip until he was covered in blood. According to the New York Times, Thaw had rented two rooms on either side of his suite to muffle the screams. The next day, Thaw's bodyguard took Gump to the aquarium and zoo before the boy managed to escape. Gump's father sued Thaw for $650,000 for the \\"gross indignities\\" that his son suffered. It was eventually settled out of court. In 1920, The McAlpin hosted what may have been the first broadcast from a New York hotel. The Army Signal Corps arranged the broadcast by singer Luisa Tetrazzini from her room in the hotel. Tetrazzini (1871-1940) was an Italian lyric coloratura soprano who had an enormous popularity in America from the 1900s-1920s. Several dishes were named after her, the origin of the ‚ÄúTetrazzini‚Äù dish is unknown, but several newspaper articles attribute it to a famous chef (not named) in New York City. Luisa Tetrazzini supposedly gave her recipe for ‚ÄúSpaghetti Tetrazzini‚Äù to Louis Paquet, Executive Chef of the McAlpin Hotel on Herald Square in New York City. Luisa Tetrazzini would subsequently take cooking lessons from Chef Louis Paquet of the McAlpin Hotel on how to make his Spaghetti Tetrazzini before embarking on one of her concert tours. In 1922, the McAlpin became one of the first hotels to link ship-to-shore radios into their phone system. The hotel would later be the first home of, and give the call letters to, radio station WMCA in 1925. In 1947, Jackie Robinson, a resident living on the 11th floor, received the phone call here from the Brooklyn Dodgers that would change America forever by being the first African American player in Major League Baseball. From 1969 to 1975 (excepting 1973), the hotel hosted the U.S. National High School Chess Championship, organized by prolific chess promoter Bill Goichberg. Marine Grill The hotel's Marine Grill was considered one of the more unusual interiors in the city of New York due to \\"an expansive grotto of polychrome terra cotta designed by the artist Frederick Dana Marsh.\\" The building owner had closed the restaurant and historic preservationists were concerned with the future of the artwork. Their worst fears were realized when Susan Tunick, president of the non-profit group Friends of Terra Cotta, saw dumpsters outside the hotel filled with fragments from the murals. Rescue efforts were eventually successful when the murals were reassembled under the oversight of the MTA Arts for Transit Program at the William Street entrance to the Fulton Street subway station.

Usage Anti-scratch coating does not interfere with how the lens functions and does not affect vision, but creates a permanent bond with the lens that reduces the appearance of hairline scratches which is common to eyeglass lenses. Although an anti-scratch coating is not 100% scratch-proof, it helps to prevent minor scratches that can easily happen to a regular lens. These minor scratches can damage the surface of the lens and impair vision. An anti-scratch coating acts as a protective layer which makes the lenses both more durable and safer. In addition to lenses, anti-scratch coatings are often used on plastic products wherever optical clarity, weathering, and chemical resistance are required. Examples include optical discs, displays, injection-molded parts, gauges and other instruments, mirrors, signs, eye safety/protective goggles, and cosmetic packaging. These coatings are usually water-based or solvent-based. Anti-scratch coatings are generally applied via spray (hand or automated), dip, spin, roll or flow coating.

The original musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone. The British-Italian co-production was produced by Edmondo Amati for The Rank Organisation and Titanus, and is widely-considered a cash-in on the success of the similarly-themed The Omen released a year earlier. It received mixed reviews, but has become a cult classic. Plot Despite doomsday warnings from throngs of locals, wealthy industrialist Robert Caine makes the controversial decision to build a nuclear power plant near a sacred cave in the Middle East. But before Caine can reap the benefits of his latest bid for global domination, he discovers that his son, Angel, is the Antichrist, who is planning to use his father's project to trigger the end of the world. As Caine digs deeper, a string of suspicious accidents occur that kill off prominent figures who criticized the project. He also notes similarities between the design of the plant and features of a biblically-prophesied beast that will herald the apocalypse. During a dream, Caine envisions the plant rising from the sea, then sees its circle of towers take on the form of a multiheaded monster. The film was released with 2 endings. The European general release version of the film features an open ending, with Kirk Douglas in exile with his newborn child, and his adult son now successfully developing the plant intended to cause Armageddon. In the shortened version released in U.S. theaters, home video, and network television, a new ending was added where Douglas returns to the company and enters a board meeting having explosives hidden on him. In the final scene, Angel's face is overlaid with an image of an explosion, showing that Robert has successfully thwarted the apocalypse. The U.S. DVD from Lionsgate retains the original darker ending.

The place was too crowded for the livestock of three families, so Palomares and Vejar sought their own land. In 1837, Mexican Governor Alvarado granted Rancho San Jose to Palomares and Vejar.Rancho San Jose The Rancho was created from land from the secularized Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. The boundaries were laid out by Palomares and Vejar on March 19, 1837, the feast day of St. Joseph, thus leading the men to name the ranch after the saint. Father Jos√© Maria de Zalvidea accompanied the party from the San Gabriel Mission, performing the first Christian religious ceremony in the Pomona Valley when he performed a benediction for settlers of the rancho under an oak tree located at what is now 458 Kenoak Place in Pomona. Luis Arenas, Ygnacio Palomares' brother-in-law, joined up with Palomares and Vejar, and they petitioned Governor Alvarado for additional grazing lands. They were granted the one square league addition, which became known as the Rancho San Jose Addition, in 1840. In 1846, Arenas sold his one third share of Rancho San Jose to Henry Dalton of Rancho Azusa de Dalton. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho San Jose was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States.

Palomares and Vejar conducted sheep and cattle operations on Rancho San Jose, also growing crops for consumption by the residents of the rancho. In the early 1860s the west coast experienced an epic flood, followed by several years of severe drought which decimated the ranch's population of sheep and cattle. On top of which a smallpox epidemic claimed the lives of 3 of the Palomare's children. Ygancio Palomares died in 1864, and his widow began selling the ranch land in 1865 finally selling the Adobe in 1874 and moving in with her children. Vejar lost his share by foreclosure to two Los Angeles merchants, Isaac Schlesinger and Hyman Tischler, in 1864.

It was while training at this airfield in 1941 that John Gillespie Magee, Jr. wrote his famous poem, \\"High Flight.\\" History The major RAF unit based at Llandow throughout its existence was No. 38 Maintenance Unit RAF (38 MU) which was tasked with the reception, storage and despatch of RAF aircraft. 38 MU opened on 1 April 1940 and closed on 15 March 1957. Other wartime RAF units were based at Llandow between June 1941 and July 1944. The first was No. 53 Operational Training Unit RAF B Flight equipped with Supermarine Spitfires which arrived on 24 June 1941. A satellite station at RAF Rhoose (now Cardiff International Airport) was used by this unit. Three small transport flights were formed here during April 1944 with No. 1312 Flight RAF remaining based until 21 July 1944 with six Avro Anson I's for transporting urgent personnel to and from the Normandy Landings area. No. 614 (County of Glamorgan) Squadron had been formed at RAF Pengam Moors in June 1937 before moving away at the outbreak of Second World War. Post war equipment required a larger airfield as base and Llandow was chosen. The Squadron officially reformed here on 10 May 1946 and the first Spitfire Mk 16's were received in November, being replaced by Mk 22's in August 1948. Jet Equipment in the form of de Havilland Vampire fighters arrived in July 1950 and continued in use until disbandment of the squadron on 10 March 1957, with all Royal Auxiliary Air Force units. Another long-resident post-war flying unit based at Llandow was No. 663 Squadron RAFs No. 1952 AOP Flight, equipped with Auster AOP.6 aircraft for spotting for local Territorial Army artillery units. This flight was based here from 1 July 1949 until disbandment in March 1957.

He subsequently cured himself by vocalizing extreme sounds, bringing about what he described as a combination of catharsis and exorcism.Newham, P. The Prophet of Song: The Life and Work of Alfred Wolfsohn. London 1997. Tigers Eye Press. Inspired by the range and flexibility of his voice, which developed as a consequence of the exercises and experiments he pursued, Wolfsohn began teaching others to use his vocal techniques as a form of therapeutic expression, which were later incorporated into drama therapy and music therapy. Meanwhile, some pupils of Wolfsohn used the extraordinary vocal range they developed to create performing arts productions, which influenced avant-garde theatre and experimental music. After Wolfsohn died in 1962, many of his long-standing pupils formed a theatre company called the Roy Hart Theatre, under the direction of South African actor Roy Hart, who had studied with Wolfsohn for fifteen years, which continued to influence practices within expressive arts therapies and the performing arts.  Overview  Alfred Wolfsohn was conscripted to serve as a stretcher-bearer in the trenches of World War I in 1914, when he was eighteen years old. After his discharge, Wolfsohn suffered persistent auditory hallucination of screaming soldiers, whom he had witnessed dying of wounds during his service. After being subsequently diagnosed with Shell Shock, Wolfsohn failed to recover in response to hospitalization or psychiatric treatment, but cured himself by vocalizing extreme sounds, bringing about what he described as a combination of catharsis and exorcism. Inspired by the range and expressiveness of his voice, which resulted from the vocal exercises and techniques he developed in an attempt to heal the symptoms of trauma sustained during the war, Wolfsohn began teaching others, acting as both a singing teacher and psychotherapist, seeking to combine the principles of both disciplines.Newham, P. 'The psychology of voice and the founding of the Roy Hart Theatre'. New Theatre Quarterly IX No. 33. February 1993 pp59-65. Wolfsohn had no formal training in either field, but nonetheless became a critic of traditional vocal pedagogy and an advocate for the principles of Analytical Psychology developed by Carl Jung.G√ºnther, M., 'The Human Voice: On Alfred Wolfsohn'. Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture 50. 1990 pp65‚Äì75. Wolfsohn began his teaching in Berlin, whilst working with the opera singer Paula Salomon-Lindberg where he developed a close mentoring relationship with the painter Charlotte Salomon. Wolfsohn and his theories inspired Charlotte Salomon to create her artwork Leben? Oder Theater? Ein Singespiel, assigning to him the name Amadeus Daberlohn.L√∂wenthal Felstiner, M., To Paint her Life: Charlotte Salomon in the Nazi Mirror.

London: Allen Lane, Penguin, 1981. After escaping Nazi Germany, Wolfsohn came to London and established the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre in a large house in Golders Green, offering an approach to singing lessons and voice training based solely upon his self-devised techniques.Hart, R., et al, 'An Outline of the Work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre', subsequently published in 'The Roy Hart Theatre: Documentation and Interviews', Dartington Theatre Papers, ed. David Williams, Fifth Series, No. 14, pp2‚Äì7. Series ed. Peter Hulton. Dartington College of Arts, 1985. The aim of his lessons was to help students extend the range and expressiveness of their voice to include every possible vocal sound, which he believed both represented and precipitated the realization of increased human potential in other areas of life.Shepard, L., An Empirical Therapy Based on an Extension of Vocal Range and Expression in Singing and Drama. Paper read at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy, London, August 1964. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Leslie Shepard, Dublin, Ireland. Wolfsohn subscribed to the views of Carl Jung, who proposed that each human psyche comprises a composite of subpersonalities that appear most vividly in dreams. Wolfsohn sought to enable the expression of these subpersonalities through distinct vocal sounds. Stevens, A., On Jung. London and New York: Routledge, 1990.Newham, P. (1990) 'The voice and the shadow'. Performance 60, Spring 1990, pp. 37-47.Newham, P. (1992) 'Jung and Alfred Wolfsohn: analytical psychology and the singing voice.' Journal of Analytical Psychology, 37, pp.323-336. A number of notable authors, theatre directors, philosophers, and scientists took lessons with Wolfsohn, or observed demonstrations by his students, subsequently acknowledging his contribution to their work, including Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, R. D. Laing, Irene Worth, Jean-Louis Barrault, Aldous Huxley, and Julian Huxley.Wolfsohn, A., Letters to Aldous Huxley. April - July 1958. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Leslie Shepard, Dublin, Ireland.Huxley, J., Letter to Alfred Wolfsohn. 14 November 1958. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Leslie Shepard, Dublin, Ireland. When Wolfsohn died in 1962, the group of long-standing students divided. One group continued to train their voices under the leadership of Roy Hart, a South African actor and regular attendant of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre since 1947, who extended the vocal demonstrations for invited audiences, instigated by Wolfsohn, into full public performances, including Eight Songs for a Mad King, composed especially for Hart by Peter Maxwell Davies. This group left the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre in Golders Green in 1969, migrated to new premises in Hampstead, and formed a performing arts troupe, assuming the name the Roy Hart Theatre, which included some who like Hart had studied with Alfred Wolfsohn, and others who had never met the German teacher, but had been students in Hart's drama classes, which the South African actor began teaching at venues across London during the late 1950s. In 1974 the Roy Hart Theatre moved to the South of France to establish a permanent rehearsal studio, school, and drama troupe. Roy Hart died in a car accident a year later, but the French-based group of remaining members continued producing experimental theatre and music productions and teaching the approach to vocal expression initially established by Wolfsohn. The other group, including vocalist Jenny Johnson and film maker, author, and archivist Leslie Shepard, dispersed and sought to continue the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Alfred Wolfsohn was instrumental in precipitating and inspiring many types of extended vocal technique used by performing artists who incorporate into their performances sounds not usually used in speech or song. In addition, Wolfsohn was a major influence on the therapeutic and creative work of Paul Newham, Wolfsohn's official biographer who together with Leslie Shepard re-established the London base for the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre in 1990. Childhood Alfred Wolfsohn was born in Berlin into a German Jewish family. In his unpublished manuscripts, Wolfsohn repeatedly describes himself as an exceptionally detached child, an outsider, and an observer, and he attributes this experience to being one of few Jewish children at school.Wolfsohn, A., The Biography of an Idea. London 1943 - 1960. (Manuscript). Trans. Marita G√ºnther. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Mal√©rargues, France.Wolfsohn, A., The Problem of Limitations. London 1958 (Manuscript). Trans. Kaya Anderson. Repository: Roy Hart Theatre Archives, Mal√©rargues, France. When Wolfsohn was 10 years old, his father, who had been a rifleman in the Franco- Prussian War, died of tuberculosis. Prior to his father's death, Wolfsohn had been disturbed by the sounds of his mother screaming during sexual intercourse, which he could hear from his bedroom. After his father died, Wolfsohn developed a close relationship with his mother, who comforted him by singing, using a high voice to depict an angel and a low voice for St Peter. Wolfsohn asserted that hearing his mother express both unpleasant screams and beautiful singing contributed to his belief that the human voice should be able to express the complete spectrum of human emotion. World War I and Illness In 1914, Wolfsohn was conscripted to military service and served as a stretcher bearer in the trenches of World War I along both the Eastern and Western front. During this time, Wolfsohn became disturbed by the vocal sounds that wounded and dying soldiers made. Furthermore, he experienced intense guilt at having run for safety, leaving behind a badly wounded soldier, rather than risking his own life to save the dying man.G√ºnther, M., The Human Voice, Paper read at the National Conference on Drama Therapy, Antioch University, San Francisco, November 1986. Published on audio tape by Roy Hart Theatre, Mal√©rargues, France.Newham, P., The Singing Cure: An Introduction to Voice Movement Therapy. London: Random House, 1993 and Boston: Shambhala, 1994. After the war, Wolfsohn was admitted to psychiatric hospital in Berlin, where he was diagnosed with shell shock, prescribed medication, and underwent hypnosis. Wolfsohn complained that his treatment failed to alleviate the auditory hallucinations of the vocal screams he had heard whilst serving in the trenches. Wolfsohn later recorded that, after being discharged from hospital, he felt as though he was dead for many years, but came back to life when he started singing. Recovery and Initial Experimental Work After discharge from hospital, Wolfsohn worked in a variety of positions, including rent-collector, bank teller, piano player for silent films, and Hazzan at synagogue funerals. During this period, he also took singing lessons with a range of teachers. Although he attributed his recovery from shell shock to these lessons, he also criticized his teachers for their adherence to a classical Bel canto approach, which prohibited him from giving voice to the sounds he had heard in the trenches. He therefore supplemented and eventually replaced the singing lessons with his own experiments, seeking to push his voice to its limits in range and timbre.Salomon-Lindberg, P., interviewed by Mary L√∂wenthal Felstiner, Amsterdam, 23‚Äì26 March 1984; 15‚Äì20 April 1985; 6‚Äì8 July 1988; 14 July 1993.

Early Teaching In 1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and Wolfsohn began to experience the discrimination to which all German Jews were subjected at that time. With the rise of the Third Reich, Wolfsohn recognized that Jews with formal employment were in a better position to avoid Nazi harassment, and in 1935 went to Dr. Kurt Singer, founder of the J√ºdischer Kulturbund, a cultural association promoting Jewish art and culture. Singer, who was a conductor, musician, musicologist, neurologist, and director of the Berlin Municipal Opera, sought to combat Antisemitism by drawing attention to the Jewish arts. He convinced the Nazis to permit a safe haven for talented Jewish artists, so they could perform for an exclusively Jewish public in community centres, synagogues, and private homes.Freeden, H., 'A Jewish Theatre under the Swastika'.

It was then that Wolfsohn began to combine his understanding of firstly the psychoanalysis developed by Sigmund Freud, and later the Analytical Psychology evolved by Carl Jung, with his unconventional approach to vocal pedagogy, seeking to help others use the singing lesson as a means to assuage and alleviate emotional and psychological difficulties.Gerne, M., Probleml√∂sung im Traum am Beispiel der Trauerverarbeitung. Zurich, 1987. Doctoral thesis, University of Zurich, 1987. Wolfsohn also developed a close relationship with Paula Salomon-Lindberg's stepdaughter Charlotte Salomon, whom he mentored. Charlotte Salomon documented her relationship with Wolfsohn in a series of paintings, in which he appears as an elusive personal tutor called Amadeus Daberlohn.Salomon, C., A Diary in Pictures, ed. A.J. Peterson with introductions by Paul Tillich and Emil Strauss. First published in Tokyo: Zokeisha, 1963, then London: Collins, 1963. Escaping Nazi Germany In January 1939, Charlotte Salomon left Germany for the south of France, and a month later, Wolfsohn fled Berlin and went to London. He volunteered to the British Pioneer Corps but was later discharged, having been classified as an invalid. In October 1943 Charlotte Salomon was captured in Nice, and dispatched to Auschwitz, where she and her unborn child were killed by the Nazis.Adam C.

The Routledge Atlas of the Holocaust. Psychology Press. p. 10. In the same year, Wolfsohn was given permission by the British Government to teach singing lessons, which he began at a house in North London that he named the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. The research, experimentation and tutoring at the Centre first attracted public attention ten years later On 22 November 1953, when a journalist observed him working with two of his pupils, Jenny Johnson and Jill Johnson. The journalist's article said of them: \\"They can sing deeper than Paul Robeson and higher than Yma Sumac.

Scientific Analysis and Artistic Application In August 1955 the voice of Jenny Johnson was examined by Professor Luchsinger of the Zurich Otolaryngological Clinic, the results of which were presented in a lecture before the German Society for Speech and Voice Therapy in Hamburg and subsequently published in an article co-written with C.L. Dubois later that year.Luchsinger, R. and Dubois, C.L., 'Phonetische und stroboskopische Unters√ºchungen an einem Stimmph√§nomen', Folia Phoniatrica, 8: No. 4, pp201‚Äì210. Trans. Ian Halcrow. 1956. This was the first clinical examination of a voice trained in the extended vocal technique established by Wolfsohn and consisted of phonetic examination, laryngoscopy, stroboscopy, electro-acoustical analysis and a tomographical investigation. Luchsinger's examinations revealed that Johnson's larynx and pharynx showed no structural abnormality, but was small and symmetrical, corresponding to that of a coloratura soprano. The recordings verified what Luchsinger described as an extraordinarily large vocal range, from C (65 c.p.s.) to f4 sharp (2960 c.p.s.), or 5 octaves and 6 tones. Thirty seven years later, in 1992, consultant larynologist David Garfield-Davies recorded a video stroboscopic examination of Paul Newham demonstrating an extended vocal technique derivative of Wolfsohn's approach at the Ferens Institute Voice Clinic, part of the Middlesex Hospital which showed how extended vocal flexibility can be produced without damage to the vocal apparatus.Newham, P. (1992) 'Singing and psyche: towards voice movement therapy'. Voice: Journal of the British Voice Association. 1, pp.75-102. In 1956 Jenny Johnson performed in the Hoffnung Music Festival, receiving favourable reviews.Author unknown (initials L.S.), 'The Hoffnung Musical Festival', The Gramophone (newspaper), December 1956.

However, the kind of recognition that Wolfsohn sought was not forthcoming until 1959, when Paul Moses, clinical professor in charge of the Speech and Voice Section, Division of Otolaryngology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, San Francisco, proposed that the research of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre had contributed substantially to an understanding of psychogenic pain generally, and the emotional and psychological causes of voice disorders specifically.Moses, P.J., Letter to Alfred Wolfsohn, 16 April 1961.

Death and New Leader On 26 January 1962, Wolfsohn ceased teaching due to ill health and died after contracting a chest infection while in hospital. Subsequently, Roy Hart, a student who had begun working with Wolfsohn in 1947, formed a performing arts company comprising some of Wolfsohn's long-standing students, and others who had taken acting lessons with Hart at various venues across London. Meanwhile, a number of other students and associates of Wolfsohn, including Jenny Johnson and author, film maker and archivist Leslie Shepard sought to continue the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre. Therapy and Theatre Whilst Wolfsohn had viewed his approach to singing and vocal expression as primarily a potential adjunct to psychotherapy, Roy Hart sought to appropriate the extended vocal range of his pupils into artistic expression, by devising, rehearsing, and performing experimental theatre with a strong focus on verbal and nonverbal vocal expression. The group that joined Hart in this endeavour after Wolfsohn's death named themselves the Roy Hart Theatre. Performances by Roy Hart and the Roy Hart Theatre influenced a number of notable contributors to the avant garde, including Peter Brook and Jerzy Grotowski.Roose-Evans J., Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook, 4th edn. London: Routledge, 1989.Back√®s-Cl√©ment, C., 'Voice and Madness; Echo of the Origin of Man', Lettres Fran√ßaises (magazine), 1979. Repository: Alfred Wolfsohn Voice Research Centre Archives. Curated by Paul Newham, London. Nonetheless, it was Hart who succeeded in introducing the therapeutic benefits of Wolfsohn's techniques where his teacher had failed, presenting papers, primarily authored by Leslie Shepard and giving demonstrations in 1963 at the Jung Institute in London; in 1964 at the Sixth International Congress of Psychotherapy in London; in 1967 at the Seventh International Congress for Psychotherapy in Wiesbaden; in 1968 at the Third International Congress of Psychodrama in Vienna; in 1970 at the Sixth International Conference for Psychodrama in Zagreb; and in 1972 at the Seventh International Congress of Psychodrama in Tokyo.Hart, R., Lecture read at the Jung Institute in London, 1963.

In addition, in 1965 the Roy Hart Theatre began working with patients at Shenley Psychiatric Hospital, St. Albans in Hertfordshire.  Move to France  In the summer of 1974, the Roy Hart Theatre group, which comprised some members who had worked with Wolfsohn for 25 years, moved to the south of France where they began converting the buildings of an old ch√¢teau into studios for vocal and theatrical research. A year later, Roy Hart, his wife Dorothy Hart, and a third group member Vivienne Young ‚Äì died in a car accident while en route between performances in Austria and a tour of Spain. Legacy Wolfsohn subscribed to the views of Carl Jung, who proposed that each human psyche comprises a composite of subpersonalities that appear most vividly in dreams. Jung claimed to have witnessed what he variously called 'mini-personalities', 'splinter-psyches', and the 'little- people' expressed through vocal sound when he observed his cousin, a girl called Helly, manifest a range of distinct vocal timbres and dialects at s√©ances, during which she claimed to be speaking on behalf of dead persons.Jung, C.G. (1953) The Collected Works of C G Jung, vol. 8 (Bollingen Series XX). H. Read, M. Fordham, G. Adler and Wm McGuire (eds). Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press and London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, pp.97‚Äì8.10 Jung, C.G. (1953) The Collected Works of C G Jung, vol. 1 (Bollingen Series XX). H. Read, M. Fordham, G. Adler and Wm McGuire (eds). Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press and London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, p.47. This became the starting point for Jung's doctoral thesis, and precipitated his later work on what he described as the multiple nature of the psyche.Redfearn, J. My Self My many Selves. London. Karnac Books, 1994Samuels, A., (1985). Jung and the PostJungians. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. Jung paid little subsequent attention to vocal expression in his work, but sought to show the way in which literature, painting, and religious symbolism give expression to the mental images of the psyche.Newham, P. (1990) ‚ÄòThe voice and the shadow‚Äô. Performance 60, Spring 1990, pp. 37-47.Newham, P. (1992) ‚ÄòJung and Alfred Wolfsohn: analytical psychology and the singing voice.‚Äô Journal of Analytical Psychology, 37, pp.323-336. Wolfsohn believed that by extending the vocal range, it was possible to give this imagery a voice, including what Jung called mini-personalities, later referred to as subpersonalities thereby providing the vocalist with an opportunity to integrate disparate elements of their personality in accordance with the principle of individuation, which was a principal aim of Jung's approach to psychotherapy. However, Wolfsohn failed to secure a meeting with Jung, and the work of the Alfred Wolfsohn Research Centre had little impact on mainstream psychotherapy. Between 1990 and 2001, Paul Newham founded a form of expressive arts therapy, known as Voice Movement Therapy and Therapeutic Voicework, which was initially inspired by both Wolfsohn's research and Jung's notion of subpersonalities, and uses the act of vocalizing, particularly singing and praying, as the means by which to explore the psyche. Newham, P. (1993) ‚ÄòThe singing cure: how voice movement therapy has evolved‚Äô. Human Communication 2, no. 2, February 1993 pp.6-8.Newham, P. (1992) ‚ÄòSinging and psyche: towards voice movement therapy‚Äô. Voice: Journal of the British Voice Association. 1, pp.75-102.Newham, P. Therapeutic Voicework: Principles and Practice for the Use of Singing as a Therapy. London, Jessica Kingsley Publishers 1998. In addition, the work of Wolfsohn and Hart influenced a number of therapists, including Alexander Lowen.Newham, P. (1988) 'Voicework as Therapy: The Artistic use of Vocal Sound to Heal Mind and Body. In S. K. Levine and E. G. Levine (eds) Foundations of Expressive Therapy: Theoretical and Clinical Perspectives. London. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, pp 89 -112. However, the influence and legacy of Alfred Wolfsohn's work is more apparent in performing arts that use extended vocal technique than in any clinical discipline.

In 2019 her grand daughter, Smitha Rajan produced a movie, \\"Mother of Mohiniyattam\\" on the life and works of Kalyanikutty Amma which is directed by Dr. Vinod Mankara. Kalyanikutty Amma passed the art of Mohiniyattam beyond India. The first Russian dancer, Mohiniyattam, was Milana Severskaya. In 1997, Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma blessed her on the continuation of the Mohiniyattam tradition. Milana Severskaya created in St. Petersburg, Russia the first outside India school of education Mohiniattam. She founded the Natya Theater, where you can see the choreography Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma in the play, dedicated to her memory. Milana Siverskaya has released a film dedicated to the memory of the guru Kalyanikutty Amma in which one can see how the guru taught dance in deep old age.

In its day, no other company's operations matched North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company in size or expense. The company operated until 1910. In the years prior, its profits and procedures had been reduced due to the landmark ruling of Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company. The mine is located within Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park, east of Highway 49 on Tyler Foote's Crossing Road, and north of Nevada City, California. The company office is still standing. History The North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company was owned by 30 investors from San Francisco, led by railroad baron Lester I. Robinson, and William Ralston, a silver miner from Sun Mountain in Nevada. The company's water rights were the same watershed as Summit Water and Irrigation Company's but lower down on Canyon Creek. The principal reservoir was at Bowman Lake, while others included Crooked, Island, Middle, Round, English/Rudyard, Sawmill, and Shotgun Reservoirs. The company's main canal was the Bloomfield Ditch, but, according to Superintendent L.L. Meyers, only a small fraction of the ditch's water was used for irrigation and most was used for mine operations. The company had numerous operations in Nevada County, including Union Diggings at Columbia Hill, but those at Malakoff Mine were the most notable. Completed in 1874-11-15, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company carved a long drainage tunnel through solid bedrock at Malakoff Mine. After tunnel completion, the company reached its peak processing of 50,000 tons of gravel each day by operating seven giant monitors twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. In the company's 1879 year-end report, the company's president hailed a major improvement as \\"... electric light of 12,000 candle intensity ... to facilitate mining operations at night better than the pitch bonfires heretofore used.\\" Sawyer Decision The tailings, dumped into the Yuba River, destroyed farm land as far west as Sacramento, creating California's first major environmental controversy. in September 1882, Edwards Woodruff, a disgruntled New Yorker who owned farmland in Marysville, brought suit in Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company, an anti-debris lawsuit. By June 1883, the case was at trial. On 1884-01-07, Judge Lorenzo Sawyer handed down what became known as the Sawyer Decision, among the first environmental decisions in the United States. While North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company was notable for operating the world's largest hydraulic gold mine in 1884, the Sawyer Decision abruptly ended hydraulic mining in Gold Country soon after. The tailings can still be found on the river as the Yuba Goldfields.

It is a prequel to Henry James' 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw, which had already been adapted into the 1961 film The Innocents. The manor house in the film is Sawston Hall, a 16th-century Tudor manor house in Sawston, Cambridgeshire.  Plot  Recently orphaned, Flora and Miles are abandoned by their new guardian (Harry Andrews) and entrusted to the care of housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Thora Hird), governess Miss Jessel (Stephanie Beacham), and Peter Quint (Brando), the former valet and now gardener. With only these three adults for company, the children live an isolated life in the sprawling country manor estate. The children are particularly fascinated by Peter Quint due to his eclectic knowledge and engaging stories, and willingness to entertain them. With this captive audience, Quint doses out his strange philosophies on love and death. The governess, Miss Jessel, also falls under Peter's spell, and despite her repulsion the two embark on a sadomasochistic love affair. Flora and Miles become fascinated with this relationship, and help Quint and Jessel to escape the interference of disapproving Mrs. Grose. The children begin spying on Quint and Jessel's violent trysts and mimic what they see, including the bondage, culminating in Miles nearly pushing Flora off a building to her death. Mrs. Grose determines to write to the absent master of the house in order to get both Quint and Jessel sacked. The children are most distressed by this, and decide to take matters into their own hands to prevent the separation. Acting on Quint's assertions that love is hate and it is only in death that people can truly be united, the children murder Miss Jessel by knocking a hole in the boat she uses to wait for Quint (who never keeps the appointments), knowing that she cannot swim. Quint later finds Miss Jessel's rigid body in the water, but is given little time to mourn before Miles kills him with a bow and arrow. The film ends with the arrival of a new governess, presumably the one who features in The Turn of the Screw.  Cast  *Marlon Brando as Peter Quint *Stephanie Beacham as Miss Jessel *Thora Hird as Mrs. Grose *Harry Andrews as Master of the House *Verna Harvey as Flora *Christopher Ellis as Miles *Anna Palk as New Governess  Differences from the book  The children in the film are portrayed as being a few years older than in the Henry James novel, probably due to the sexual nature of the film and their roles in it (Verna Harvey was in fact 19 at the time).http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-nightcomers Production The film was based on an original script by Michael Hastings. He started with the beginning of the Turn of the Screw and plotted backwards. He says he wanted the two lead characters to be \\"plausible... based on their strange eroticism.\\" Brando's casting was announced in November 1970. Filming took place in February and March 1971. Release The film opened at the 32nd Venice International Film Festival on 30 August 1971.  Reception  Critical The film has received positive reviews. Brando's performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor BAFTA, but recent audiences have criticised his cartoonish Irish accent.http://www.britishhorrorfilms.co.uk/nightcomers.shtml The film has a 75% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nightcomers/ Some reviewers have objected to the film's premise of showing what happened before the novel, as this threatens the ambiguity the novel explores. Tom Milne took a very negative view of The Nightcomers, describing it as \\"a film crass enough to have the outraged ghost of Henry James haunting Wardour Street\\". Milne also criticised Hastings' script, stating his dialogue \\"sounds embarrassingly like a Cockney nanny doing her best to be genteel\\". Box office The film was a commercial disappointment at the box office. However Michael Winner claimed the film made its money back, adding \\"it was only the sex and violence that made it profitable. It was rather an intellectual piece, but without the violence it would have gone nowhere at all.\\" References External links English-language films Films directed by Michael Winner Films scored by Jerry Fielding Embassy Pictures films Films set in 1897 Films set in country houses Films shot in Cambridgeshire Films based on The Turn of the Screw ","title":"The Nightcomers"},{"id":"19134928","text":"Vuollerim () is a locality situated in Jokkmokk Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 732 inhabitants in 2010.

Bernstein. Description DNSCurve uses Curve25519 elliptic curve cryptography to establish keys used by Salsa20, paired with the message authentication code (MAC) function Poly1305, to encrypt and authenticate DNS packets between resolvers and authoritative servers. Public keys for remote authoritative servers are placed in NS records, so recursive resolvers know whether the server supports DNSCurve. Keys begin with the magic string \`uz5\` and are followed by a 51-byte Base32 encoding of the server's 255-bit public key. E.g., in BIND format: example.com. IN NS uz5bcx1nh80x1r17q653jf3guywz7cmyh5jv0qjz0unm56lq7rpj8l.example.com. The resolver then sends to the server a packet containing its DNSCurve public key, a 96-bit nonce, and a cryptographic box containing the query. The cryptographic box is created using the resolver's private key, the server's public key, and the nonce. The response from the server contains a different 96-bit nonce and its own cryptographic box containing the answer to the query. The cryptographic tools used in DNSCurve are the same used in CurveCP, a UDP- based protocol which is similar to TCP but uses elliptic-curve cryptography to encrypt and authenticate data. An analogy is that while DNSSEC is like signing a webpage with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), CurveCP and DNSCurve are like encrypting and authenticating the channel using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Just as PGP-signed webpages can be sent over an encrypted channel using SSL, DNSSEC data can be protected using DNSCurve. DNSCurve claims advantages over previous DNS services of: * Confidentiality‚Äîusual DNS requests and responses are not encrypted, and broadcast to any attacker. * Integrity‚Äîusual DNS has some protection, but with patience and sniffing attackers can forge DNS records; this is prevented by DNSCurve cryptographic authentication. *Availability‚Äîusual DNS has no protection against denial of service (DoS) by a sniffing attacker sending a few forged packets per second. DNSCurve recognizes and discards forged DNS packets, providing some protection, though SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, are also vulnerable to DoS. Security DNSCurve uses 256-bit elliptic-curve cryptography, which NIST estimates to be roughly equivalent to 3072-bit RSA. ECRYPT reports a similar equivalence. It uses per-query public- key crypto (like SSH and SSL), and 96-bit nonces to protect against replay attacks. Adam Langley, security officer at Google, says \\"With very high probability, no one will ever solve a single instance of Curve25519 without a large, quantum computer.\\" Speed Adam Langley has posted speed tests on his personal website showing Curve25519, used by DNSCurve, to be the fastest among elliptic curves tested. According to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), elliptic curve cryptography offers vastly superior performance over RSA and Diffie‚ÄìHellman at a geometric rate as key sizes increase. Implementations DNSCurve first gained recursive support in dnscache via a patch by Matthew Dempsky. Dempsky also has a GitHub repository which includes Python DNS lookup tools and a forwarder in C. Adam Langley has a GitHub repository as well. There is an authoritative forwarder called CurveDNS which allows DNS administrators to protect existing installations without patching. OpenDNS has released DNSCrypt to protect the channel between OpenDNS's users and its recursive resolvers. Jan Moj≈æ√≠≈° has released curveprotect, a software suite which implements DNSCurve and CurveCP protection for common services like DNS, SSH, HTTP, and SMTP. Deployment OpenDNS, which has 50 million users, announced support for DNSCurve on its recursive resolvers on February 23, 2010. Then on December 6, 2011, OpenDNS announced a new tool, called DNSCrypt. DNSCrypt protects the channel between OpenDNS and its users. No equally large authoritative DNS providers have yet deployed DNSCurve.  See also  DNSCurve is intended to secure communication between a resolver and an authoritative server. For securing communication between DNS clients and resolvers, there are several options: * DNS over TLS, defined by two standards-track RFCs, RFC 7858 and RFC 8310 * DNS over HTTPS, standardized in RFC 8484 * DNSCrypt Notes External links *Official website *DNSCurve.io: a community for DNSCurve users *High-speed cryptography and DNSCurve, a June 2009 presentation by the author *DNSCurve: Usable security for DNS, an August 2008 presentation by the author *draft-dempsky-dnscurve-01 Proposed standard \\"DNSCurve: Link-Level Security for the Domain Name System\\", sent by M.

Dyce persuades Beckett it will be in his interests to bump off Dyce's wealthy aunt for her money. Beckett travels to the old lady's house on the South coast, and prepares to murder her but loses his nerve and in a struggle, accidentally pushes her down a flight of stairs, killing her anyway.

The job of directing eventually went to Michael Winner, who had made a number of low budget movies including Play It Cool. Winner said the film \\"had been turned down by a lot of people\\" and producer Danny Angel had \\"just sacked Joseph Losey because he was going to turn it into a film that Mr. Angel didn‚Äôt like.

Critical reception The Radio Times wrote, \\"Michael Winner's skirmish with British social realism shows what life was like in the bedsits of Notting Hill, years before Julia Roberts showed up. The script is mostly a series of loosely connected sketches, though the film's sole virtue nowadays is the location camerawork of Otto Heller that captures the then peeling and shabbily converted Regency houses that were riddled with dry rot and Rachmanism, which exchanged squalor for extortionate rents. Stanley Black and Acker Bilk's music adds a cloying note to a movie that rarely rises above basement level\\"; but Variety noted, \\"it has its merits.

Often comprising a place converted from another use, such as a store front, warehouse, or factory loft, it is then made into a display or performance space for use by an individual or group of artists. According to art advisor Allan Schwartzman \\"alternative spaces were the center of American artistic life in the '70s.\\"Quoted by Brian Wallis, Public Funding and Alternative Spaces in Julie Ault, Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p165. 1970s USA A prominent wave of alternative spaces in the United States occurred in the 1970s,Robert Atkins, edge: alternative spaces today, Art in America, Nov, 1998, p2. with the first spaces established in 1969, including Billy Apple's APPLE and Robert Newman's Gain Ground where Vito Acconci produced many important early works and Philadelphia's Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia.

The Kitchen was established in New York in 1971. A.I.R. Gallery opened in September 1972 as an alternative space women's co-op gallery. About this time And/Or Gallery opened in Seattle, Washington, the first alternative space of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. It was founded by Anne Focke. Bonnie Sherk's Crossroads Community (The Farm), another early alternative space, was established in San Francisco in 1974.Peter Selz, Art of Engagement, University of California Press, 2006, pp229-230. Real Art Ways, in Hartford, Connecticut, was founded in 1975.Robert Atkins, edge: alternative spaces today, Art in America, Nov, 1998 The wave of alternative spaces that emerged in the US through the mid-1970s were typically organized by collectives of artists whose interests were focused on conceptual art, mixed media, electronic media, diversity and performance art. For instance, Franklin Furnace Archive in New York was established in 1976 by Martha Wilson to exhibit performance work.Kristine Stiles, Peter Howard Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 1996, p693. LACE in Los Angeles and Washington Project for the Arts showed performance and video work. One of the most enduring alternative spaces in New York, P.S 1, was founded in 1976. Exit Art in Manhattan opened in 1982. In 1981 the New Museum staged the exhibition \\"Alternatives in Retrospect: An Historical Overview 1969-1975\\", guest curated by Jacki Apple. This exhibition looked at early New York alternative galleries, Gain Ground, Apple, 98 Greene Street, 112 Greene Street Workshop, 10 Blecker Street, Idea Warehouse and 3 Mercer. The exhibition was documented with a publication and video. Macdonald argues that such spaces emerged in the wake of art practices in the 1960s and 1970s that reacted against the presumed neutrality of the \\"white cube\\" gallery space.Sharon Macdonald, A Companion to Museum Studies, Blackwell publishing, 2006, p234. Alternative Spaces exhibition In Chicago, the exhibition Alternative Spaces curated by Lynne Warren at the Museum of Contemporary Art catalogued the scores of artists and artists' spaces to emerge during that period, including Artemisia Gallery (1973-2003), ARC Gallery (1973-), Gallery Bugs Bunny (1968-1972), N.A.M.E.

Demise in USA Among the factors contributing to the demise of alternative spaces in the late 1980s in the USA was the reduction of public funding for artists and for the arts. With the election of Ronald Reagan as President came a restructuring of federal supports, such as an end to the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program, through which some artists found employment, and restrictions placed upon the National Endowment for the Arts.McLellan, Joseph (26 September 1985). \\"NEA: The First 20 Years; Looking Back On the Up-and-Down Union of Government and Art\\". Washington Post. The net result of the rightward ideological movement in government ‚Äì with its open hostility to non- traditional art ‚Äì was that 'alternative artists' were not only de-funded, they and the galleries that featured them were prominently criminalized.c.f. National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley et al. 524 U.S. 569 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500, 1998 U.S. 'Mapplethorpe battle changed art world'. Cincinnati Enquirer. 21 May 2000. By the 1990s, NEA funding was significantly reduced, and so was the number of non-profit galleries.Brian Wallis, Public Funding and Alternative Spaces in Julie Ault, Alternative Art, New York, 1965-1985, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p164. Europe In Europe the culture of alternative exhibition spaces differs somewhat from the situation in the United States and has a strong root in the squatting counterculture, which is not illegal in every European country. Also many countries have governmental art funding structures that support many off spaces. In the Netherlands there is OT301, W139 and ADM (evicted) (all in Amsterdam), Roodkapje (Rotterdam), Nest (The Hague), Sign (Groningen). In the UK there is the MK Gallery in Milton Keynes and formerly projects such as 491 Gallery and 121 Centre. Belgium has Het Bos in Antwerp. Liebig 12 is an alternative exhibition space in Berlin. In Vienna there is Mo√´. Ljubljana has Metelkova with many alternative art spaces, and Copenhagen has alternative spaces in Freetown Christiania.

Muraine gained international attention when he gave a lengthy audition to the instrumental of the obscure tune \\"It's Me Bitches\\" by Swizz Beats for Season 4 of the television program So You Think You Can Dance, during which executive producer and judge Nigel Lythgoe declared that Muraine was his favorite dancer of 2008 and then handed him the ticket in a mock slow motion fashion. Many So You Think You Can Dance viewers uploaded the audition to their YouTube accounts moments after the show aired, making the audition clip one of So You Think You Can Dance's most successful viral videos, earning around 26,000,000 accumulated views only a week after the video surfaced. Muraine later quit the show during contestant selection due to the difficult choreography, but appeared later in the season for a guest performance, after which Lythgoe suggested a dance-off with Phillip \\"PacMan\\" Chbeeb. The dance-off aired in August 2008 during the season finaleReality TV Calendar - So You Think You Can Dance: The Finale - Performance and Results and the judges selected Muraine as the winner. Muraine also represented the US in Superstars of Dance on NBC later in fall of 2008, specifically winning the bronze medal in the solo category, which helped lead the US to take the top prize for the season. He was referred to as the \\"popping soloist\\" of the team. In the same year Muraine starred in a television commercial for IKEA in 2008 called \\"What Goes Where?\\" in which he arranges IKEA products alongside Shugamai Johnson performing with robot dance and liquid dancing.The Making Of The Ikea Commercial (Feat Robert Muraine), YouTube video Muraine also starred in various other commercials and viral videos in 2008 including adverts for Pringles, BlackBerry, Strike Bowling & Uvestment. Robert also collaborated with Laurent Bremond, a French filmmaker in 2008 to make a short viral documentary about Muraine's unique dance and way of life. From 2009 to early 2011 Muraine was involved in the Cirque Dreams: Illumination 2009-2010 tour of the US. He was majorly featured in segments \\"An Urban Beat with Robert Muraine\\" a short number constructed with help of choreographer Ruddy Betancourt [New Century Dance Company] and \\"Detour\\" a number in which Muraine and the Mongolian contortion group Contortion Sisters put together a 'twisted & funky' mix of his dancing and the troupe's traditional contortion. Between the shows and seasons of his tour with Illumination, Robert would be asked to perform in various parts of the World of Dance Tour \\"the largest urban dance competition in the United States focusing on the art of street dance and choreography, taking place in 14 cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom\\" Several video clips of his freestyle performances at World of Dance shows have been uploaded and posted by audiences all over the US to have gained millions of international views to this day. In Summer and Fall of 2011, Muraine was contracted for his first time abroad in the German circus show called Magnifico directed by Andr√© Heller. Shortly after the tour launched the company filed for bankruptcy, leaving Muraine as a free agent in Europe. In 2012 and 2013 Robert earned medals for his 'Eccentric Dance' piece in the Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in France and The Nikulin Circus Festival in Moscow, in which he also earned 'the most creative act of 2012' award. Robert now travels the world performing his act in all different types of live shows all over the world and currently works with Crazy Horse in Paris and is working on his 'new contortion number' and putting together 'a few comedy acts for future festivals'.

Diablo school district board and the Contra Costa County Office of Education both denied the petition. In 2016, a group named Northgate CAPS (Community Advocacy for our Public Schools) began a new campaign to separate Northgate High and its feeder elementary and middle schools into a new, separate school district. On May 2‚Äì3, 2017, the Contra Costa County Board of Education held public meetings on the petition. The county board recommended against the proposal; the state board of education could still take up the proposal but has not done so as of July 2018.  Academics  Northgate High School was named a distinguished school in 2007. The school employs 60 certified teachers. 21 Advanced Placement courses are offered in fields including science, math, English, foreign language, social science, and art. Approximately 97% of graduates attend four-year or two-year colleges and universities. The school had a 94% graduation rate in 2010‚Äì2011. Unlike some other schools in the Mt. Diablo district, Northgate does not have any formal academies. However, for freshmen it does offer a Global Perspectives \\"pathway\\". A fixed cadre of students takes three \\"threaded‚Äù classes (English 1, World History, and Art Design) that build connections between the content in all three. Project-based learning is designed to strengthen concepts taught in the classes. The course catalog also offers several sets of suggested courses for students with a specific interest, but these are not planned collaboratively; they include sequences in communications, environmental studies, animation, and engineering. Every senior must participate in a Mock Congress during the fall and must present a Senior Project at the end of the school year.  Extracurricular activities   Athletics  The Northgate High School Athletic Department oversees 2 competitive varsity athletic teams that compete in the Diablo Valley Athletic League (in the North Coast Section of the California Interscholastic Federation). Northgate's sports include football, cheerleading, basketball, baseball, soccer, volleyball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, swimming, tennis, track and field, softball, water polo, and wrestling. During the 2013-14 year, the school broke ground on a new center to provide a pool for the aquatics teams and facilities for the school's sports medicine program. The aquatics facilities were completed in 2015 and are now used for water polo and swim team practices and meets, as well as an aquatics unit in freshmen PE. The annual football game between Northgate and its cross-town rival Las Lomas High School is nicknamed \\"The Battle of the Creek\\" after Walnut Creek, California.  Performing arts  All Northgate performing arts programs operate chiefly out of the Jack De Rieux Little Theatre, which was remodeled and enlarged in 2006. The instrumental music program consists of a Concert Band, Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, two Jazz Bands, Orchestra, and Marching band (all are regular courses except the extracurricular marching band). Concert band is the entry- level band consisting of only 9th grade students. Symphonic Band is the largest instrumental music group, typically consisting of 10th, 11th, and 12th grade members. Orchestra is a string orchestra that consists of students from all grades; the prerequisite is previous experience with private teachers or Orchestra in middle school. The audition process for Wind Ensemble, Jazz Band I, and Jazz Band II, the three most advanced bands, is competitive in nature due to a high number of talented students vying for a small number of spaces. In addition to concerts on campus, each spring the jazz ensembles usually hold a concert at Yoshi's nightclub in Oakland. All the other groups perform together at the Dean Lesher Regional Center for the Arts in downtown Walnut Creek. Jazz I won the \\"Next Generation Jazz Festival\\" portion of the Monterey Jazz Festival in five consecutive years (2014‚Äì2018), a record for that competition. The choir program consists of several groups: the entry-level Concert Choir, which does not require an audition, Cantiamo (Level 2 Women's Choir), Il Coro (Level 2 Men's Choir), Bella Voce (Level 3 Women's Choir) and Madrigals (Level 3 Co-ed Choir). In order to be a part of Cantiamo or Il Coro, students must choose a song to audition with. To get into Bella Voce or Madrigals, any prospective member must have first spent at least one year in Il Coro or Cantiamo (some exceptions have been made in the past), and audition with a song of their choice and a selected choir piece. Cantiamo members trying out will decide whether they are trying out for Madrigals, Bella Voce, or both. Madrigals have a heavy winter schedule, as they do holiday gigs for restaurants and families that hire them. This fundraising activity has been in place since the late 1970s and occupies most of December for the members. Bella Voce performs a variety of gigs throughout the year as well. The funds from these activities support the students' spring tour. Bella Voce, Madrigals, Cantiamo, Il Coro and the Instrumental Music program all go to Disneyland in the spring to perform and participate in the musical programs that are held for high schools and other performing arts groups. This event is called \\"Disney Performing Arts\\" (formerly known as \\"Magic Music Days\\"). The drama program consists of four levels, the last being Production Workshop which produces at least one play per semester. Students have the opportunity to try working with all aspects of theater, including stage lighting, sound design, promotions, scenic design, props (theatrical property), and stage management. Northgate also participates in the Devil Mountain Improv League, a completely student-created and student-run coalition of competitive high school improvisational theater students that has been around since 1996.  Student groups  In 2013, Northgate hosted approximately 43 clubs and organizations. Some notable student organizations include the Northgate Mock Trial team, Quiz Bowl team, and VEX Robotics team. These include school chapters of Junior State of America, National Honor Society and the California Scholarship Federation, Model United Nations, the Filipino Cultural Club, Northgate Robotics Group, Key Club, Bowling Club, and Podcast Club.  Architecture  Northgate High School has received both acclaim and criticism for its brutalist architecture. The school is built into the side of a hill on Castle Rock Road, at the foothills of Mt. Diablo. The school is sometimes referred to as a prison by its students, because of its concrete exterior and a lack of windows in all classrooms (see Gallery below). When the school was originally constructed, none of the classrooms had permanent walls; rather, they had half-high walls that could be moved to make more room if needed. Classrooms were later retrofitted with walls because the concept was considered a fire hazard. Movable walls in classrooms were replaced by full- height walls. The school closed for many months after the Loma Prieta Earthquake due to the discovery of asbestos. During the 1990‚Äì91 school year, portable classrooms were used on the school grounds and the former Castle Rock Elementary grounds. The library sits in the main forum of the school and remains one of the only areas with five-foot walls, making the library very open, and is in clear view of the office on the second floor. In the center of the school is a small atrium, which has been variously used as a lounge area or as a native-plant garden with plants, a small pond, and even turtles. Northgate High School \\"atrium\\"  In popular culture  The movie The Principal was partially filmed at Northgate High School. Northgate was chosen as a location for its partial-wall \\"open environment\\" classroom design, representing an easy teaching job at a \\"nice school\\" for the character Rick Latimer (James Belushi). After getting into trouble he is transferred to a tough school in Oakland, California.

The modern Cook County Circuit Court was created through a 1964 amendment to the Illinois Constitution which reorganized the courts of Illinois. The amendment effectively merged the often confusing and overlapping jurisdictions of Cook County's 161 courts, which were organized as municipal courts and specialized courts, into one uniform and cohesive court of general jurisdiction, organized into divisions, under the administration of one chief judge. More than 2.4 million cases are filed every year. To accommodate its vast caseload, the Circuit Court of Cook County is organized into three functional departments: County, Municipal, and Juvenile Justice and Child Protection. As of December 2014, the court has 402 judges.http://www.cookcountycourt.org/ABOUTTHECOURT/JudgesInformation.aspx Among them, 257 of the judges are circuit judges, who are elected for six-year terms either at-large from across the entire county, or from one of the court's 15 residential subcircuits. Circuit judges must be retained by voters every six years. The Illinois Supreme Court can fill circuit judge vacancies between elections. Any court-appointed judges must go before voters at the next available primary and general election in even-numbered year. As of December 2014, seven judges currently elected as circuit judges are instead serving as justices on the Illinois Appellate Court's First District through Supreme Court appointments. Should their term on the appellate court expire before their elected circuit court terms, they will revert to their old positions. Another 145 judges are associate judges, elected by secret ballot among the court's circuit judges. The circuit judges also elect among themselves a chief judge for the court, who holds the power to assign judges to various calls throughout the court. Circuit Judge Timothy C. Evans has served as chief judge since September 2001. Dorothy Brown is the current Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County ‚Äî a county-wide popularly elected position charged with managing the court's vast amounts of documents and related matters. County Department The County Department is divided into the following divisions: Law, Chancery, Domestic Relations, County, Probate, Criminal, Domestic Violence, and Elder Law and Miscellaneous Remedies. Each division is headed by a presiding judge. The types of cases heard in each division depend on the nature of the controversy. Law Division The Law Division hears civil suits for recovery of monetary damages in excess of $30,000 in the city of Chicago, and in excess of $100,000 in the suburban districts, as well as many types of administrative reviews. Cases heard include: personal injury and wrongful death, motor vehicle injury, medical malpractice, legal malpractice, product liability, intentional tort, construction injuries, commercial litigation, fraud, breach of contract, breach of warranty, employment security, property damage, premises liability, and miscellaneous remedies. As of January 2018, The Honorable Judge James P. Flannery Jr., is the presiding judge of Cook County's law division, and oversees all other judges within that division. The vast majority of cases filed, litigated, and tried in Cook County's law division take place in the Daley Center, which sits in Chicago. The Daley Center is also known as the first municipal district. In 2016, it usually took an average law division case three years to run its course from the original complaint being filed to jury verdict. Also, because of the sheer number of cases filed within the Daley Center's law division, it is broken up into two sections: The motion section and the trial section. As of 2018, ten judges preside over the Law Division's motion section, which are all located on the Daley Center's 22nd floor. As of 2018, the Honorable Judge Kathy Flanagan is the supervising judge over the other judges presiding over cases within the Law Division's motion section.http://www.cookcountycourt.org/JudgesPages/FlanaganKathyM.aspx Simply distilled, the job of the judges presiding over cases within the Law Division's motion section is to oversee the attorneys handling the case to ensure that they are preparing the case for trial in a timely fashion. Another equally important duty the judges in the motion section have is to hear dispositive motions, oversee discovery disputes, and adjudicate critical questions of law that only arise before a case is transferred to the a different judge in the law division's trial section. Those uninitiated and unfamiliar with practicing law in Cook County should be aware that almost all litigation concerning any given case predominantly takes place before the judge presiding over the case in the Law Division's motion section. To put this in perspective, an ordinary case will usually spend two years and 11 months being presided over by a motion section judge, before being transferred to a separate judge in the Law Division's trial section where a two-week trial before a jury will ensue.http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/SupremeCourt/AnnualReport/2016/2016_Statistical_Summary.pdf As of 2018, twenty-six judges preside over the Law Division's trial section. While Judge James P. Flannery Jr. presides over all law division cases filed in Cook County, he is also the supervising judge overseeing all judges within the Law Division's trial section at the Daley Center.http://www.cookcountycourt.org/JudgesPages/FlanneryJrJamesP.aspx The job of judges presiding over a case transferred to that judge in the Law Division's trial section is to oversee the trial in the case. This includes adjudicating motions in limine, voir dire, the trial itself, and post-trial motions filed after the jury in the case has returned a verdict, if at all. The Law Division includes Commercial Calendars, with eight assigned Commercial Calendar judges, one of whom acts as Supervising Judge (the Hon. Margaret A. Brennan as of March 2019). The Commercial Calendars have specialized jurisdiction over commercial disputes, and function as a Business Court. The Commercial Calendars represent one of the oldest specialized business courts in the United States. Outside of the Daley Center, cases filed in Cook County's Law Division which takes place at any of the other five municipal court houses in Cook County are usually presided over by a single judge who presides over the case's motions and the corresponding trial. Chancery Division The Chancery Division hears actions and proceedings, regardless of the amount of the claim, concerning a variety of matters. The division consists two sections: General Chancery Section and the Mortgage Foreclosure/Mechanics Lien Section. The General Chancery Section hears the following types of actions: injunctions, class actions, declaratory judgments, contract matters, creditors' rights, construction of wills and trusts, trusteeships, receiverships, dissolution of partnerships and corporations, statutory and administrative reviews, and vehicle impoundments, among others. The Mortgage Foreclosure/Mechanics Lien Section hears actions concerning the Mechanics Lien Act, liens on chattels for labor or storage, other lien remedies, and all actions and related proceedings initiated under the Illinois Mortgage Foreclosure Law.  Domestic Relations Division  The Domestic Relations Division hears matters concerning the family, including: dissolution of marriage, legal separation, invalidity of marriage, civil orders of protection, child support, child custody and visitation, parentage, and enforcement and modification of previously entered judgments in these matters. This division does not hear adoption or guardianship cases, which are heard in the County Division and Probate Division, respectively. County Division The County Division hears the following types of actions: adoption, marriage of minors, annexation and deannexation of land to a tax body, elections, inheritance taxes, mental health proceedings, real estate taxes, municipal organizations, and actions involving the forfeiture of seized property, name changes, and other matters the Circuit Court of Cook County has jurisdiction over but are not otherwise provided for. Probate Division The Probate Division hears matters concerning wills and administration of estates. Cases heard include: probate and contest of wills and testamentary instruments; claims against an estate arising in contract, tort or otherwise; administration of estates of decedents, disabled persons, minors and wards; contracts to make a will; construction of wills, and actions arising under the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. Criminal Division The Criminal Division hears cases in which the State of Illinois alleges the commission of a serious criminal act (other than those heard by the Domestic Violence Division) such as armed robbery, assault, burglary, criminal sexual assault, murder, among others. This division also hears actions regarding habeas corpus and extradition in criminal matters, and petitions to expunge records of arrest. The George N. Leighton Criminal Courts Building on the southwest side, in South Lawndale houses the Criminal Division. Domestic Violence Division The Domestic Violence Division hears both civil and criminal actions involving issues of domestic violence. Some of the types of actions this division hears are: civil orders of protection, civil no contact orders, stalking no contact orders, and criminal actions involving relationships defined by the Illinois Domestic Violence Act. Elder Law and Miscellaneous Remedies Division The Elder Law and Miscellaneous Remedies Division hears actions and proceedings involving elderly persons. Some examples of the types of cases this division hears are: powers of attorney, cases arising under the Adult Protective Services Act, domestic violence cases involving elderly persons, and certain criminal matters in which an elderly person is the victim. Municipal Department \\"The Municipal Department is divided into six geographic districts. Each district is supervised by a presiding judge. The First Municipal District encompasses the City of Chicago. Municipal Districts Two through Six encompass the communities in suburban Cook County. The Municipal Department hears civil suits for damages up to $30,000 in the First Municipal District & up to $100,000 in Municipal Districts Two through Six, and less serious criminal matters. This Department hears the following types of cases: housing, eviction proceedings, small claims, licenses, misdemeanor criminal proceedings and felony preliminary hearings other than domestic violence matters, ordinance and traffic enforcement, contract cases decided by alternative dispute resolution process, and cases subject to mandatory arbitration, among others. Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Department Cook County Juvenile Detention Facility and Courthouse The Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Department is the Circuit Court of Cook County's newest department. Prior to its creation as a full-status department by then Chief Judge Donald P. O'Connell in January 1995, the Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Department was originally known as the Juvenile Justice Division and functioned as a part of the County Department. The establishment of the Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Department marked the first restructuring of the Circuit Court of Cook County in its thirty-year history. The department is divided into two divisions: Juvenile Justice and Child Protection. Each division is headed by a presiding judge. The Juvenile Justice Division hears cases involving delinquent minors under 17 years of age. The Juvenile Justice Division also orders programs and services to rehabilitate these minors and monitors their progress through probation officers. Cases heard include: minors addicted to alcohol or other drugs, minors requiring authoritative intervention (runaways or those beyond the control of a parent, guardian or custodian), among others. The Child Protection Division hears cases involving child abuse, child neglect, child dependency, private guardianship, and termination of parental rights. The Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Resource Section serves as liaison to the academic, business and religious communities to identify and develop services and resources that will augment programs vital to juvenile justice. The section is supervised by an administrative presiding judge and is located in the Richard J. Daley Center. The Cook County Juvenile Court was the first juvenile court established in the U.S., in 1899. During its first quarter century, its most important person was Mary Bartelme, whose official titles were Cook County Public Guardian and then (after 1913) assistant to the judge. Bartelme devoted much of her life to child welfare and the reform of juvenile laws, and became an associate justice in 1923 and presiding judge in 1927.  Analysis and criticism  Accusations have been made of corruption in the Probate Division, resulting in a three-year suspension recommendation against the accusing attorney by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.

They are trial courts of original jurisdiction. There are 24 judicial circuits in the state, each comprising one or more of Illinois' 102 counties. The jurisdiction of six of these circuits courts are solely within the confines of a single county; these are Cook, Kane, Will, DuPage, Lake, and McHenry (all Chicago metropolitan area counties). The other 18 circuits each contain between two and 12 counties. The circuit court has general jurisdiction and can decide, with few exceptions, any kind of case. (The exceptions are redistricting of the Illinois General Assembly and the ability of the governor of Illinois to serve or resume office.) The circuit court also shares jurisdiction with the Supreme Court of Illinois (the state supreme court) to hear cases relating to revenue, mandamus, prohibition, and habeas corpus. However, if the supreme court chooses to exercise its jurisdiction over these cases, the circuit court may not decide them. The circuit court also reviews administrative decisions of certain state agencies. There are two kinds of judges in the circuit court: circuit judges and associate judges. Circuit judges are elected for six years, may be retained by voters for additional six-year terms, and can hear any kind of case. Circuit judges are elected on a circuit-wide basis or from the county where they reside. In the Circuit Court of Cook County, which contains Chicago and is the largest of the 24 circuits in Illinois, circuit judges are elected from the entire county or as resident judges from each of the fifteen subcircuits within the county. Associate judges are appointed by circuit judges, under Supreme Court rules, for four-year terms. An associate judge can hear any case, except criminal cases punishable by a prison term of one year or more, unless the associate judge has received approval from the Supreme Court to hear other criminal cases. Circuit judges in a circuit elect one of their members to serve as chief judge of the circuit court. Cases may be assigned to general or specialized divisions by the chief judge who has general administrative authority in the circuit, subject to the overall administrative authority of the Supreme Court.

It is located in the Dongcheng District of the city at 74 Wangfujing Street. The construction of the church was finished in 1655 by Jesuit missionaries. Due to renovations and reconstruction, the current structure dates back to 1904. The church is the second oldest in Beijing after the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. '  History   Original structures (1653‚Äì1900)  The congregation was first established in 1653 by Father Lodovico Buglio, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and theologian who worked as a missionary to China. The land the first church building was constructed on was donated to the religious order by the Shunzhi Emperor. At the time, the Jesuits were the only group of people from Europe given permission to reside in the capital city, on account of their insight into astronomy. As a result, the church also served as the residence of Buglio and another fellow Jesuit priest. The church underwent an extremely turbulent history. An earthquake which struck Beijing in 1720 damaged the building. Approximately ninety years later, the church building was obliterated by fire and the remnants that survived were destroyed as a result of the government's anti-Western sentiments and policies. The site remained barren until 1860, when British and French forces invaded Beijing as part of the Second Opium War. Thereafter, foreign missionaries, who were once again allowed into the capital, rebuilt St. Joseph's. However, anti-foreign sentiment never faded away and arose once again at the turn of the century, culminating in the Boxer Rebellion. At the height of the uprising in 1900, the church building was \\"burned to the ground\\".  Present-day cathedral  St. Joseph's was rebuilt in 1904 utilizing Romanesque Revival architecture, featuring pilasters and three bell towers. In 1949, Communist forces under Mao Zedong emerged victorious in the Chinese Civil War. The new atheistic regime broke off all diplomatic relations with the Holy See two years later, and attempted to eliminate all forms of religion by either seizing or destroying churches and other places of worship. St. Joseph's suffered the same fate and, in the 1950s, it was expropriated to the government, who then turned it into an elementary school. The communist government further tightened their control on the Catholic Church in China by establishing the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA) in 1957. As a result, the church of St. Joseph's has been under the administration of the CPCA since that year and its parish priests are not recognized by the Vatican. ' The church was closed down altogether in 1966‚Äîthe first year of the Cultural Revolution‚Äîand suffered further damage during this period of time until the end of the revolution in 1976.  Location  How to get there: take Beijing metro line no. 1 to Wangfujing station. Walk north along Wangfujing Street for 10 minutes: church is on your right.  Restoration  right The Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. At the Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee in September 1979, a key document was tabled that evaluated the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution \\"an appalling catastrophe\\" and \\"the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949].\\" The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It stated that \\"Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the \\"cultural revolution\\", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary.\\" Furthermore, Deng briefly allowed free speech to flourish, thus permitting open and public criticism of the government to take place. Known as the Beijing Spring, this led to a universal condemnation of the Cultural Revolution throughout the country. The change in prevailing political views was favorable to St. Joseph's Church; the Beijing municipal government funded the church's restoration efforts. The refurbished building reopened in 1980 for Catholic services. Another significant renovation on the church was completed in September 2000. On July 16, 2007, Fr. Joseph Li Shan‚Äîthe then- parish priest of St. Joseph's‚Äîwas elected as the new Archbishop of Beijing by the CPCA. Although no official Vatican statement was issued, Pope Benedict XVI expressed his approval of the appointment, making Li one of the few bishops in China to have the support of both the government and the Holy See.  Architecture  320px The church of St. Joseph was built in a Romanesque Revival style and is noted for its mixture of European and local Chinese features in its design. A plaque attached to the outside wall details the history of the church. Surrounding outside the church is a large square and park that is 1.2 hectares. It contains a statue of the Madonna and Child.  In popular culture  The Church of St. Joseph's appears in Cixin Liu's novel The Three Body Problem, where the three Romanesque vaults mirror the nature of the physics conundrum.

The cave is designated as a Registered Natural Landmark by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. History The cave was discovered in June 1872 by two boys named Peter Rutan and Henry Homer while they were hunting rabbits with their dog. The dog chased a rabbit into a brush pile, where they then disappeared. While searching through the brush pile, the two boys found an opening, fell through it, and landed in the first level of the cave, where they found their dog. The boys returned home and told everyone about their discovery. The cave became known as Good's Cave, named for Emmanuel Good, the owner of the farm on which the cave was located.History of Seneca Caverns In 1931, Don Bell, a lawyer from Bellevue, discovered a series of passageways and rooms in the cave which led to an underground river, called Ole' Mist'ry River, which is part of the vast groundwater system that underlies the surrounding region.

The group was formed by MC Kermit La Freak (later simply Kermit - real name Paul Leveridge) and brothers Dangerous Hinds (real name Anderson Hinds) and Dangerous C (real name Carson Hinds). History Kermit grew up in Moss Side, Manchester - where he learnt to play violin at the age of 6 - and was briefly a DJ under the name of 'DJ la Freak', whilst doing a psychology degree at Manchester Polytechnic. He joined the breakdance crew Broken Glass, who moved into making records with \\"Style of the Street\\" following a meeting with Manchester DJ and producer Greg Wilson. The song was recorded for the Street Sounds Electro UK (Street Sounds, 1984) album, but the label owner Morgan Khan was impressed with their work and persuaded them to record more tunes for the album. In order to give the impression of a thriving British hip hop scene, the songs were recorded under a variety of aliases: in truth, of the seven tracks on the album, only one was not recorded by Broken Glass. Kermit met the Hinds brothers - at the time calling themselves the Dangerous 2 - and together they decided to form the Assassins, with Greg Wilson staying with them as a producer. Their first release was the single \\"We Don't Kare\\" (Murdertone, 1987), which had as a B-side a song by Kiss AMC - an all-female Manchester rap group that featured Christine \\"Kiss\\" Leveridge, Kermit's sister. They followed this with two singles entirely of their own, \\"The Meltdown Session\\" (Murdertone, 1988) and \\"The Drone Session EP\\" (Murdertone, 1989) - in between which, Dangerous C performed a rap for a B-side remix of Kym Mazelle's \\"Useless (I Don't Need You Now)\\" (Syncopate, 1988). Following this, the group released Killer Album (Murdertone/EMI, 1990). The album was a mixture of social commentary (\\"Justice (Just Us)\\") and more comical tunes (\\"Jealous MC\\" or a high-octane cover of The Coaster's \\"Yakety Yak\\"). It yielded two minor hit singles in \\"Just Mellow\\" and \\"And It Wasn't A Dream\\" (a duet with Tracey Carmen). The album received critical praise - UK hip hop magazine Hip Hop Connection (February 1991, No. 25) called it \\"the best rap album the UK had ever produced\\" - and even managed to get the single \\"And It Wasn't A Dream\\" (Murdertone/EMI, 1990) terrestrial television airplay. But despite making an impact within the scene, and getting crucial support from John Peel at BBC Radio 1 the album failed to translate this into sales. This album was reissued with extra tracks by Original Dope/Cherry Red in October 2010. Trying again, the group went back to the studio to record their second album Th!nk, It Ain't Illegal Yet, introducing live percussion from Ged Lynch to their usual mix of social commentary (\\"No Tale, No Twist\\" told the story of life growing up in Manchester's urban slums, whilst \\"Down and Dirty\\" was a sex rhyme featuring \\"guest vocals\\" from Jealous MC). Again, the album was liked by the critics and the industry - BBC Television had Dangerous C on an edition of Blue Peter to demonstrate the techniques of sampling and plug the album - but again, this good reception was not reflected in sales. The group split up shortly afterwards. Soon after the Assassins' split, Kermit and Ged joined Shaun Ryder to form the group Black Grape and earned pop success with them, before leaving the band after suffering from sepsis and being replaced by Psycho. Since then, Kermit has released records as Manmade and made guest appearances on other artists' songs, such as Bentley Rhythm Ace. His more recent project was Big Dog with Ged from Black Grape. Anderson Hinds left the music industry and worked as a teacher - although in a 2000 interview Kermit mentioned that the two of them were considering making more tunes together. Ged Lynch became a session musician.

Guidelines for the Safe Use of Sodium Fluoroacetate (Occupational Safety & Health Service, 2002 ‚Äì ): http://www.pce.parliament.nz/assets/Uploads/PCE-1080.pdf Usage West Coast of New Zealand The largest users of 1080 in New Zealand are the Animal Health Board and the Department of Conservation (DOC). It is also used on a smaller scale for pest control by Regional Councils and private landowners. The first trials were carried out in New Zealand in 1954, and by 1957 its use had become widespread. 1080 baits are used through ground-based and aerial application. 1080 is considered to be suitable for use as a mammalian pest control in New Zealand because the country has only two native land mammals (bats). It should also be noted that 1080 is commonly used in Western Australia to kill feral carnivores, as the compound is naturally occurring in Western Australian flora and the native herbivores and their native predators are immune. Controlling conservation pests New Zealand's flora and fauna evolved for 80 million years with moa being the primary browsing animals and no predatory mammals. Consequently, the native birds, insects, and flora have developed no natural defence mechanisms against introduced animals such as possums, rats, mustelids and feral cats. These exotic species have become ecological pests, and their presence has had a disastrous effect on the populations of many endemic species, including the national symbol, the kiwi bird. Populations of the reptile tuatara have also been severely impacted. An estimated 30 million possums inhabit New Zealand,How Many Possums Are Now in New Zealand Following Control and How Many Would There Be Without It? (Warburton et al., 2009): http://www.envirolink.govt.nz/PageFiles/159/720-NLRC104%20Possum%20numbers%20inNZ.pdf and they are found in 98% of vegetated areas on mainland New Zealand. When correctly applied, 1080 is very effective at controlling conservation pests. One aerial application can kill 98% of possums and more than 90% of ratsForest & Bird website: http://www.forestandbird.org.nz/saving-our-environment/native- plants-and-animals-/protecting-native-forests-1080/1080-frequently-ask in the targeted area. These successful knock-down rates provide vulnerable native birds with a crucial breeding window to raise chicks through to fledging, increasing their survival rate. The DOC uses aerially applied 1080 poison across about 440,000 ha of conservation land each year. This equates to 5% of the total conservation estate. DOC's pest control programme is governed by residual trap catch rates, the percentage of nights in which a trap catches a pest. Targets are usually set to less than 5%, though rates below 2% can be achieved by 1080. Controlling agricultural pests In New Zealand, The common brushtail possum was the main vector for the spread of bovine tuberculosis‚Äîa highly contagious disease affecting farmed cattle and deer. The disease was endemic in possums across about 38% of New Zealand (known as 'vector risk areas') but industry sources acknowledge the incidence of Bovine Tuberculosis has now fallen to less than 0.05% in the areas where it is monitored. The organisation responsible for managing bovine TB in New Zealand‚Äîthe Animal Health Board‚Äîuses 1080 poison as one of a rangePossum control methods (Animal Health Board website‚Äîretrieved August 2011): http://www.ahb.org.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=124 of pesticides to kill possums and control the spread of disease to both livestock and unaffected areas of the country. Aerial application of 1080 poison is only used in places where ground control methods are impractical or unable to knock possum numbers down to a low enough level to break the disease cycle. In 2011, this was less than 10% of the total area receiving possum control.Dr Paul Livingstone, Animal Health Board TB eradication and research manager (Gisbourne Herald, 26 May 2011): http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article/?id=22957 Both aerial and ground-based application of 1080 poison are also used to control rabbits‚Äîan introduced grazing pest.1080 needed for Mackenzie rabbits (Timaru Herald, 3 May 2008): http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/399532/1080-needed-for- Mackenzie-rabbitsIf we lose 1080, we're shot: Butcher (Otago Daily Times, 30 January 2010): http://www.odt.co.nz/the-regions/central-otago/91130/if-we- lose-1080-we039re-shot-butcher By 1960, it had become the main poison used in rabbit control.

In general, the majority of conservationists and livestock farmers support the continued use of 1080 for pest control, while the hunting community, animal rights groups and antifluoride campaigners support a ban, although there are exceptions on both sides.Example include: Organised opposition is usually small-scale and localised to areas where aerial 1080 operations are carried out.Protest action promised (Greymouth Star, 2010): http://greystar.co.nz/node/198Protesters stop Coromandel 1080 drop (Waikato Times, 19 September 2009): http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato- times/news/2881440/Protesters-stop-Coromandel-1080-drop Protest is generally peaceful, but there have been occasions where opponents have resorted to violenceAnti-1080 protesters arrested on West Coast (Marlborough Express, 15 June 2010): http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/national- news/3814197/Anti-1080-protesters-arrested-on-West-CoastArrest over attack on conservation board chairman (New Zealand Herald, 27 July 2011)http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid;=10741222 or sabotage.In 1995, 1080 protestor Chris Short hijacked a helicopter and took two hostages (Radio New Zealand story): http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/55928/long-time-1080-protester-chris- short-diesIn 2010, anti-1080 activists placed a fake bomb at the headquarters of a Taupo 1080 poison contractor (The Dominion Post, 19 June 2010): http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3830385/1080-bomb-hoax-a-terrorist-act In August 2007, the Environmental Risk Management Authority released a review that gave new guidelines for the use of 1080 in New Zealand, and concluded the beneficial effects of pest eradication outweighed the risks. 1080 decomposes in natural water and soil into harmless compounds. In June 2011, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) released a report in favour of 1080 to control possums, rats, and stoats, especially in large and remote areas. It is seen as an effective poison for aerial spreading. The PCE came to a number of conclusions, including not having a moratorium on 1080 use, and setting up a Game Animal Council. In June 2011, New Zealand's four largest daily newspapers all ran editorial pieces questioning the need for continued debate in light of the PCE's report.Examples include:  In 2004, anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned. An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public. He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap. Sign at a supermarket after someone had threatened to poison infant milk with 1080 In 2015, the New Zealand Police revealed that anonymous blackmail threats were sent to Fonterra and Federated Farmers saying that infant formula in supermarkets would be poisoned unless the use of 1080 was halted by the end of the month. Fonterra responded by working with the Ministry for Primary Industries to develop two high-throughput, validated test methods and then testing every tanker of milk and every batch of infant formula for 1080. The ensuing police response Operation Concord led to charges laid against 60-year-old businessman Jeremy Hamish Kerr, who pleaded guilty to two charges of blackmail and was sentenced to 8 years 6 months imprisonment. Kerr had developed a rival brand of poison called Feratox and made the threats for financial gain. The court heard that Kerr received around $100,000 a year in royalties from Feratox, but sales were dwindling. Support The following agencies, organisations and political parties support the use of 1080 in New Zealand: * The Animal Health Board, New Zealand's largest user of 1080 poison, strongly advocates for the continued use of 1080 to control the main TB vector ‚Äî the common brushtail possum. * The Department of Conservation, New Zealand's second-largest user of 1080 poison, strongly advocates for the continued use of 1080 poison to control ecological pests. * Federated Farmers, New Zealand's biggest farmers' advocacy organisation, strongly supports the continued use of 1080 to control agricultural pests. * Forest & Bird, New Zealand's biggest conservation charity, strongly advocates for the continued use of 1080 poison to control ecological pests. * The Labour Party, one of New Zealand's two biggest parties, expressed strong support for the recommendations in the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report into 1080 * The National Party, one of New Zealand's two biggest parties, welcomed the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment on the use of 1080 as the most effective tool available for pest management in New Zealand.(National Party media release, 8 June 2011): http://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=36209 * ACT, New Zealand's classical liberal party, does not support a ban on the use of 1080. * Local Government New Zealand, the organisation that represents the national interests of all 85 regional councils, unitary authorities, district councils, and city councils of New Zealand, stated in a submission to the 2007 ERMA reassessment that \\"1080 is an important tool in New Zealand for pest animal control and TB control, as well as helping to maintain and protect our unique native flora and fauna.\\" * The Environmental Risk Management Authority concluded, in its 2007 reassessment of 1080, that the benefits of using it clearly outweighed the risks. * The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (Te Kaitiaki Taiao a Te Whare PƒÅremata), whose role it is to review and provide advice on environmental issues and the system of agencies and processes established by the government to manage the environment, concluded in their 2011 report on the poison that if we want to keep our forests for future generations we simply cannot afford to stop using 1080. * The New Zealand Veterinary Association recognises that, in the absence of effective alternatives, the continued use of 1080 as a means of pest control (possums and some other introduced species) is necessary to assist the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and the conservation of New Zealand's unique native flora and fauna. Opposition These organisations and political parties have opposed the use of 1080 in New Zealand: * The Royal New Zealand SPCA has called for a move away from 1080, stating that its use: \\"inflicts terrible, prolonged suffering on the animals that it poisons\\" but it recognises there is currently no alternative: \\"SPCA would like to see New Zealand move away from a reliance on poisons, including 1080, with the ultimate goal of being able to stop their use. We are realistic and pragmatic and we understand humane alternative solutions take time to develop and implement.\\" * The New Zealand Deerstalkers Association, which promotes the interests of hunters in New Zealand, have reiterated their national policy of opposing 1080 poisoning in the face of the Parliamentary Commission report advocating its increased use. *The United Future political party, dissolved in 2017, supported fur recovery and trapping methods over aerial 1080, and labelled the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's report on 1080 a \\"kick in the guts for many of our provincial communities\\".1080 report 'kick in guts for communities' (United Future media release, 8 June 2011): http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/dunne-1080-report-kick-in-guts-for-communities/ *The Kiwi Party, dissolved in 2011, said, \\"the government-funded science for 1080 was not credible as government owned the 1080 factory and government- funded agencies spread the poison.\\"Pro 1080 line flawed (Kiwi Party media release, June 2011): http://www.thekiwiparty.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=210&Itemid;=59 *SAFE, an animal rights group, considers the use of 1080 poisoning an extremely cruel practice.1080 (SAFE website): http://safe.org.nz/issue/1080 *Ban 1080 Party, a single-issue party dissolved in 2018, was founded by Bill Wallace and opposed the use of 1080 poison. The party's co-leaders were Bill Wallace and Mike Downard.Party website: https://ban1080.co.nz/ Neutral stance These organisations and political parties have a neutral stance on the use of 1080 poison in New Zealand: * The MƒÅori Party welcomed the report on 1080 by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment,Maori Party reviewing its bill to ban the import, manufacture and use of 1080 in Aotearoa (MƒÅori Party media release, 8 June 2011): http://maoriparty.org/index.php?pag=nw&id;=1688&p;=maori-party-reviewing-its- bill-to-ban-the-import-manufacture-and-use-of-1080-in-aotearoa-rahui- katene.html As a result of the report, it has dropped a call to ban 1080. In the run up to the 2011 general election, its party line was that \\"(1080 is) all we have at the moment and it's really good for the things like the rats and the stoats\\" but says more research is needed.Rahui Katene, quoted in the Election soapbox: 1080 http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/readers- reporter/5969642/Election-soapbox-1080 Alternatives Biodegradable 1080 poison is the only pesticide currently registered for use on mainland New Zealand as suitable for aerial targeting of possums. While many research teams are actively seeking new and supplemental approaches to current technologies, no method has yet gained widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to 1080. Research New Zealand currently spends at least $8 million annually on improving existing pest control technology and developing new methods.http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal- pests/methods-of-control/1080-pest-control/1080-questions-and- answers/#alternatives According to the EPA's Annual Report on the Aerial Use of 1080,Environmental Protection Authority's Annual Report on the Aerial Use of 1080 For the year ended 31 December 2010 (TABLE 4) http://www.epa.govt.nz/Publications/EPA%201080%20AR%202010%20web.pdf as of October 2011 there are currently over 50 research projects underway industry- wide to find improvements in the use of 1080, alternatives to 1080 and other related topics. Comparing pest control methods In the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's June 2011 re-evaluation of 1080, these questions were used for assessing the effectiveness and safety of 1080, as well as current and prospective alternatives #Can the method decrease populations of possums, rats and stoats? #Can the method increase populations of native species? #Can the method rapidly knock down erupting populations of pests? #Can the method be used on a large scale in remote areas? #Is the method sufficiently cost-effective? #Does the method leave residues in the environment? #Can by-kill from the method be minimised? #Does the method endanger people? #Does the method kill humanely? The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's conclusion with regards to 1080 was, \\"It is not perfect, but given how controversial it remains, I for one expected that it would not be as effective and safe as it is\\". The Parliamentary Commissioner reached the following conclusions regarding the possible alternatives to 1080 poison currently available in New Zealand. Pindone, diphacinone, and coumatetralyl Pindone, diphacinone, and coumatetralyl are the first-generation anticoagulants most commonly used for pest control. They are generally very effective at controlling rats to keep their numbers low, but cannot effectively deal with sudden population surges. Anticoagulants break down very slowly in water and soil. They also accumulate in the liver tissue of live animals that have been exposed to the poison (either by eating bait or feeding on an animal that has eaten bait) and in carcasses. They are also the most inhumane of the poisons currently used.Beausoleil, N.J., Fisher, P., Warburton, B. and Mellor D.J. 2010. How humane are our pest control tools? Part 1. Vertebrate toxic agents and kill traps in mammal species. Unpublished report prepared for Biosecurity New Zealand, Project No. 11326. 86 p. By-kill of native species is a significant risk from the use of first-generation anticoagulants.Fairweather, A. and Fisher, P. 2010. Pindone. A review of current knowledge. Pesticide information reviews series, Part 10 (Version 2010/1 updated August 2010). Different types of anticoagulants need to be rotated to avoid populations becoming bait-shy or building up resistance. Brodifacoum Brodifacoum is a second-generation anticoagulant. It is licensed for killing possums and rats. Like 1080, it will kill stoats that feed on poisoned animals. It has been successfully used in aerial operations to completely eradicate possums, rats, and stoats on several offshore islands and fenced 'mainland islands' that are now sanctuaries for endangered animals, but it is not currently registered in New Zealand for general aerial use on the mainland. Brodifacoum takes a very long time to break down in soil and water and accumulates in the tissue of exposed animals for years. Consequently, there is a very high risk of by-kill ‚Äì it is known to have killed at least 21 species of native birds, including kiwi, kaka, kakariki and tui.Fisher, P. and Fairweather, A. 2010. Brodifacoum. A review of current knowledge. Version 2.6. Department of Conservation Pesticide Information Reviews series. Department of Conservation, Hamilton. It is also widely considered a very inhumane poison.Littin, K.E., O‚ÄôConnor, C.E., Gregory, N.G., Mellor, D.J. and Eason, C.T. 2002. Behaviour, coagulopathy and pathology of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) poisoned with brodifacoum. Wildlife Research 29: 259‚Äì267. Cyanide Cyanide has been used in New Zealand since the 1940s, and is licensed for killing possums and wallabies. It is a highly lethal, broad-spectrum poison that depletes cells of energy, quickly resulting in respiratory arrest and death.Eason, C.T. and Wickstrom, M. 2001. Vertebrate pesticide toxicology manual (poisons). Department of Conservation Technical Series 23. Ground-laid cyanide has killed native species and other animals in the past (including kiwi, kea, weka, and bats) and it takes only a tiny amount of cyanide to kill a human. While there are antidotes to cyanide poisoning, their effectiveness is controversial and the rapid action of the poison limits the time in which they can be used.Fisher, P. and Fairweather, A. 2009. Cyanide. A review of current knowledge. Pesticide information reviews series. Part 1 (Version 1.5 updated June 2011). Its effectiveness varies because of bait shyness.Fisher, P. and Fairweather, A. 2009. Cyanide. A review of current knowledge. Version 1.5, Department of Conservation, DOCDM-25420. Cholecalciferol Cholecalciferol naturally occurs as vitamin D3 in many foods, including fish. It was developed as a poison to control rats and mice in the 1980s. It works by leaching calcium from the bones of the poisoned animal into its bloodstream, leading to organ failure. Cholecalciferol will reduce populations of possums and rats, but not stoats, since it does not bioaccumulate in animals. It breaks down readily in the environment and the risk of by-kill is considered to be low. Cholecalciferol is more expensive to produce than 1080. Some promising results have been obtained by combining cholecalciferol with other substances, such as aspirin, to make it more cost- effective and faster acting.Eason, C., Murphy, E., Ogilvie, S., Blackie, H., Ross, J., Kaveramann, M., Sam, S., Statham, M., Statham, H., Lapidge, S., Humphrys, S., Henderson, R., MacMorran, D., Gibson, T., Gregory, N., Harrison, J., Giles, G., Sammut, I., Jansen, P., Conole, D., Rennison, D. and Brimble, M. 2010. Trends in vertebrate pesticide use and new developments: New Zealand initiatives and international implications. Proc. 24th Vertebrate Pest Conference (R.M. Timm and K.A. Fagerstone, eds.). Cholecalciferol is very inhumane.Beausoleil, N.J., Fisher, P., Warburton, B. and Mellor D.J. 2010. How humane are our pest control tools? Part 1. Vertebrate toxic agents and kill traps in mammal species. Unpublished report prepared for Biosecurity New Zealand, Project No. 11326 Para-aminopropiophenone Para- aminopropiophenone (PAPP) was developed to control stoats, weasels, and feral cats, and registered for use in New Zealand in 2011.Shapiro, L., Eason, C.T., Murphy, E., Dilks, P., Hix, S., Ogilvie, S.C. and MacMorran, D. 2010. Para- aminopropiophenone (PAPP) research, development, registration, and application for humane predator control in New Zealand. Proc. 24th Vertebrate Pest Conference. (R.M. Timm and K.A. Fagerstone, eds.) pp. 108‚Äì114. It kills by preventing red blood cells from carrying oxygen. PAPP kills stoats directly, but not possums and rats. It is approved for use in paste form or in fresh minced meat, so will only provide effective stoat control as part of intensive ground control. The risk of by-kill is likely to be low since it does not leave residues in the environment. Zinc phosphide Zinc phosphide (microencapsulated zinc phosphide paste) has been widely used overseas for decades, predominantly to control rats and mice on agricultural land. It causes death by heart or respiratory failure.Beausoleil, N.J., Fisher, P., Warburton, B. and Mellor D.J. 2010. How humane are our pest control tools? Part 1. Vertebrate toxic agents and kill traps in mammal species. Unpublished report prepared for Biosecurity New Zealand, Project No. 11326. In August 2011, the New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority approved the import and manufacture of microencapsulated zinc phosphide (MZP paste) as an alternative to 1080 for the ground control of possums. The application was made by Pest Tech Limited, with support from Connovation Ltd, Lincoln University, and the Animal Health Board. It will be used as an additional vertebrate poison in certain situations. Unlike 1080, it cannot be used for aerial application. Sodium nitrite Sodium nitrite is a naturally occurring substance commonly used as a meat preservative, but toxic at higher doses. It kills in a similar way as PAPP, by reducing the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen (methemoglobinemia). Sodium nitrite is expected to be registered for use in for killing possums, but not rats. It will not control stoats because it will not knock down rat populations or bioaccumulate in poisoned animals. It does not leave residues in the environment and the risk of by-kill is expected to be low. It is much more humane than 1080. Trapping Ground operations of which trapping is an important component have been shown to help populations of native birds. Possums, rats, and stoats can all be killed with traps. However, an intensive ground operation will typically involve trapping possums and stoats, but poisoning rats because there are so many more of them and they reproduce quickly. In a mass event, populations of rodents rapidly increase as much as ten-fold, and traps simply cannot be deployed rapidly enough or in sufficient numbers to knock them down. Some terrain is too rugged or dangerous for trapping, and trapping is not practical on a large scale. In one day, a single trapper can check traps on tens of hectares, whereas an aerial 1080 drop can cover tens of thousands of hectares. Once a trap has 'snapped', it will not catch another animal unless it is reset. Traps need to be checked and reset regularly, which makes them labour-intensive. Self-resetting traps, such as the Goodnature trap, are being developed and trialled, and could in the future significantly reduce labour costs and increase the cost-effectiveness of ground control operations. Twenty three species of native birds have been reported as having been killed by leg- hold traps,Spurr, E. 2000. Impacts of possum control on non-target species. In: T. Montague (ed.). The brushtail possum: biology, impact and management of an introduced marsupial. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln. and many kiwi have suffered leg or beak damage.Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. 1994. Possum management in New Zealand. Wellington. These traps are now required to be set up off the ground on conservation land where kiwi or weka (which are ground-dwelling birds) live. Biological control Biological control has been likened to the 'Holy Grail' of pest control by a number of sources,The ecological challenge of immunocontraception (Barlow, N.D.), Journal of Applied Ecology 2000, 37, 897¬±902Norris, A et al. Review of the management of feral animals and their impact on biodiversity in the rangelands. Pest Animal Control CRC Report, June 2005 and was a major focus for research funding during the 1990s and 2000s in both New Zealand and Australia. Most of the methods proposed involved some form of genetic engineering, and if developed further would attract a great deal of public opposition. No biological control method has therefore yet gained widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to 1080.

Formation Joe Jones grew up in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and received a classical musical education at Hartnett Music School in New York City. In the late 1950s he began a short career as a jazz drummer. In 1960 Jones began to study avant-garde experimental composition first briefly with John Cage and then Earle Brown. Through these associations he formed an artistic alliance with Dick Higgins, Alison Knowles and La Monte Young. Fluxus Jones first started experimenting with mechanical instruments in 1962, creating objects like musical boats, solar music umbrellas and a pedaled vehicle that pulled handmade instruments on wheels called \\"The Longest Pull Toy in the World\\".Obituaries, New York Times, 2/18/1993 \\"Joe Jones, an Artist With a Musical Bent and an Inventor, 58\\" The following year his works were exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York City. Beginning in 1963 Jones participated in the Fluxus art movement, taking part in a number of Fluxus performance art activities with his automaton-like music machines - made from found ready-made instruments. Interview with Joe Jones by Nakagawa Shin (1992) In 1963 he performed his machinic noise music at the Yam festival Owen Smith (1998) Fluxus: The History of an Attitude, San Diego State University Press, pp. 118 in New Brunswick and a year later he performed again at the Avantgarde music festival in New York City. He created many machine drum exhibitions and art actions in New York City and Nice, France during this period. In 1969 he opened his own \\"Music- Store\\" at 18 N. Moore Street in New York City. There he presented his repetitive drone music machines in the window so that anyone could press the numerous door buttons to play the machine noise music in the window. He also gave small musical installation performances by himself and musicians such as Yoko Ono and John Lennon,Owen Smith (1998) Fluxus: The History of an Attitude, San Diego State University Press, pp. 206-209 among others. After moving out of 18 N. Moore his store-loft space became the art studio of Fluxus archivist and digital artist Joseph Nechvatal, then the once Theatre of Eternal Music member Jon Hassell and finally video artist Bill Viola before being merged into Walkers Restaurant. In 1971 Jones produced the album Fly together with Lennon and Ono and founded the 'Fluxus-Airline' with George Maciunas.Owen Smith (1998) Fluxus: The History of an Attitude, San Diego State University Press, pp. 117-119 Jones made automated instruments for Ono's recordings \\"Don't Count The Waves\\", \\"You\\", and \\"Airmale\\" that appear on Fly and the Onobox. Photos of these automated instruments can be seen in the gatefold of Fly. Soon after Jones left New York for Europe; living in Amsterdam, Asolo, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf and finally Wiesbaden and continued to exhibit worldwide in galleries and museums. Since the mid-1980s Jones produced short digital art films on computer that he called \\"Fluxus-Home-Movies\\". He also devised larger orchestra-like installations with his music machines called \\"solar orchestras\\" mp3s of music by Joe Jones at UbuWeb that would be performed from when the sun comes up to the sun goes down by solar power. In 1988 his works could be seen at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne and in 1992-93 there was a big touring exhibition with stops in Helsinki, Nuremberg, Rotterdam and Wuppertal.

They specialized in very small finely detailed prints, some no larger than a postage stamp. The leading members were Hans Sebald Beham, his brother Barthel, and George Pencz, all from Nuremberg, and Heinrich Aldegrever and Albrecht Altdorfer.Antony Griffiths, Prints and Printmaking, p. 46, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd edn, 1996 Many of the Little Masters' subjects were mythological or Old Testament stories, often treated erotically, or genre scenes of peasant life.Mayor, p. 315, and Russell, p. 11 and passim throughout The size and subject matter of the prints shows that they were designed for a market of collectors who would keep them in albums, of which a number have survived. The term Kleinmeister was used of the Nuremberg Little Masters as early as 1679, by Joachim von Sandrart, and has been applied to other groups of artists, from the genre masters of the Dutch Golden Age to a group of 6th- century BC Ancient Greek vase-painters. Artists The earliest artist to make very small intricate engravings was Altdorfer in 1506‚Äì7, probably following the example of Italian niello prints,Mayor, p. 315 although their size was in fact no smaller than the bottom end of the very cheap devotional woodcuts made throughout the 15th century. However Altdorfer's printmaking developed in different directions, though he continued to produce some small engravings until the 1520s, by which time the style had been taken up by the Nuremberg artists, the Beham brothers and their close friend Pencz.Bartrum, pp. 12 and 115 Hans Sebald Beham and Pencz continued to produce engravings until shortly before their deaths in 1550, which effectively ended the style; Barthel Beham had died in 1540. Barthel is generally considered the most inventive of the Nuremberg trio, but his brother Sebald was much more productive, with perhaps the finest technique, and also copied some of Barthel's prints after his death. Aldegrever was a convinced Lutheran who developed Anabaptist leanings, which perhaps led to him spending much of his time producing ornament prints with no human figures. One of a series of tiny (about 5.1 x 7.9 cm) prints of the Labours of Hercules by Hans Sebald Beham;The full set with catalogue details the Little Masters did not let small size deter them from tackling the largest subjects of history painting. The influence of the friezes of Polidoro di Caravaggio is seen here. Their engraving style was based on the work of Nuremberg master printmaker Albrecht D√ºrer, who was still living in the city until 1527, and in whose workshop Pencz at least may have trained,If he is the \\"Knecht\\" (boy) \\"J√∂rg\\" recorded as marrying D√ºrer's maid. Hind, p. 85 and the Italian Marcantonio Raimondi, with whom Barthel Beham is supposed to have worked in Rome. Raimondi, and the exterior fresco friezes of Polidoro di Caravaggio, influenced their choice of subjects and compositional style,Mayor, pp. 315‚Äì17 to which Northern themes of death (Death appears personified in many prints, as above) and humour are added. The prints of Hans Baldung Grien contain similar treatments of sexual themes. Compared to their contemporaries, devotional subjects are notably absent in the work of the Nuremberg artists, who were all expelled from the city for their religious views in 1525 ‚Äì an episode that still remains rather unclear. Their prints were very widely disseminated, and both drawn copies and examples of the originals have been found in albums from Mughal India,Bartrum, p. 12 and their figurative compositions were copied in Limoges enamel and various other decorative media, from bronze plaques to stoneware pottery.An example of a stoneware jug is at Bartrum, pp. 112‚Äì13 In addition many of their prints were \\"ornament prints\\", consisting entirely of ornament in the Renaissance style, which as well as being collected were designed to be used as patterns for craftsmen in various media. Ornament print by Jacob Binck, 2.4 √ó 8.4 cm. Minor members of the group were Jacob Binck and Hans Brosamer, and there are some prints by a \\"Master IB\\", named after his monogram, who may be either Pencz, Sebald Beham, or a separate artist.Hind, p. 85 Other artists who did some work on a similar small scale, but are not usually classified as part of the \\"Little Masters\\" group, include: Virgil Solis, Matthias Zundt, Jost Amman, and Conrad Sald√∂rfer in Germany, Hans Holbein the Younger in Switzerland and England, and Dirk Vellert (in etching) and \\"Master S\\" in the Netherlands.Landau & Parshall, pp. 332 and 356 The etched work of the Hopfer family is often similar in size and must have appealed to a similar market, as did the rather later work of the French printmaker Etienne Delaune.

History Settlement by non-natives began in 1861 with homesteading by a James Codville, who built a store and hotel and provided wintering quarters for animals belonging to miners of the Cariboo Gold Rush. In 1895 a large 300-acre farm was established by Sam MacDonald, which provided beef for communities downriver; that farm is still by his heirs today. His son donated an acre of his lands for the island's first school in 1890; the school was used as a community gathering-place, with the local chapter of the Odd Fellows Association meeting there from 1893 onwards, and Methodist circuit services were held there.

Loosely organised and biased towards the obscure and avant-garde, it was described by The Guardian in 1997 as \\"one of the emblematic institutions of the 1960s\\". The Arts Lab was originally based in a run-down youth centre run by The Birmingham Settlement on Tower Street in Newtown on the northern edge of Birmingham City Centre, and was accessible from the street only via a metal fire escape. It moved to a former brewery on Holt Street in Gosta Green in 1977, before financial problems and pressure from the arts establishment forced it to amalgamate with and take over Aston University's Centre for the Arts on Gosta Green to form the more conventional Triangle Arts Centre in 1982. The Birmingham Arts Lab had a wide influence across numerous art forms. Figures involved with the Arts Lab, often early in their careers, included cartoonists Hunt Emerson, Edward Barker, Kevin O'Neill, Bryan Talbot, Steve Bell and Suzy Varty; playwrights David Edgar and David Hare; film director Mike Figgis; writer and poet Gareth Owen; comedian and performance artist John Dowie; photographer and journalist Derek Bishton; the psychedelic group Bachdenkel; novelist Jim Crace; singer Ruby Turner, film maker and photographer Pogus Caesar and composer and sonic artist Trevor Wishart. History Origins The genesis of the Birmingham Arts Laboratory can be traced to a meeting on 8 September 1968, of five figures (Mark Williams, Fred Smith, Dave Cassidy, Tony Jones and Bob Sheldon) from the Midlands Arts Centre, who had been promoting avant garde music performances at the centre's outdoor auditorium and had been involved in Mike Leigh's experiments in improvised theatre, but had become frustrated at what they saw as the bureaucracy and obstructionism of the centre's management. The group resolved to start a breakaway venue to \\"provide a centre for experimenting in the Arts; be a community of creative people, self-aware and self-supporting; participate creatively in the life of the City; and present work of both its members and visiting groups and individuals\\" There followed five months of fund-raising events around the city called Strange Days and featuring bands such as Fleetwood Mac, Colosseum and DJ John Peel (whose fundraising efforts saw him became the Arts Lab's first life member), during which a local charity offered the group the use of a first floor room in its Newtown Youth Centre as a venue. The Arts Lab opened in January 1969, initially only at weekends. Terry Grimley, later arts correspondent of the Birmingham Post, recalled \\"When I first found my way to the Arts Lab, it did not resemble an arts centre so much as a night club with a rather different ambience to other places in town. Nothing happened except at weekends, and not much happened then either, except that music was played, coloured lights were projected and people ate vegetables and brown rice and drank instant coffee.\\" Tower Street The Arts Lab was open full-time from April 1969. Initially occupying only a single room on the top floor of the building but quickly expanding to occupy the whole first floor (with the gymnasium becoming the main theatre and performance space), and eventually to occupy the entire building with the ground floor providing artist studios. Within its first year it established a cinema programme organised by Tony Jones and Pete Walsh, and theatre programme organised by Pete Stark, and two experimental arts festivals ‚Äì Cybervironment Plus organised by Simon Chapman and Gathering Number Oneorganised by Pete Stark. Funding from the Arts Council from 1971 secured its future and saw it begin to employ those working there. The Arts Lab was initially run along the lines of a club for members and guests. Although it never had a drinks licence (due to constant friction with the local licensing authorities) it had a coffee bar, beneath which was a void between the floors in which several members intermittently lived. Jim Crace later recalled that \\"it was no surprise to discover a badly-smelling playwright or drink-wrecked mime artist emerging between your legs from a priest hole below the floorboards\\". The Arts Lab started with no formal organisation, but with Peter Stark as unofficial administrator. Stark left in 1970 and was replaced by Simon Chapman, who left in 1972 to become the Director of the Ikon Gallery and was replaced by Ted Little. Little was to be artistic director through to 1982, apart from a two- year spell as head of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, during which he transformed it \\"from a club for the self-absorbed of Kensington to a roaring popular venue\\" and paved the way for its important role in the early years of British punk. Holt Street The Arts Lab's earlier chaotic, co- operative organisation was increasingly challenged by funders from 1975 onwards, with a formal Board of Management being established in 1976. August 1977 saw the Arts Lab move completely from Tower Street to new, much larger premises in a former brewery on the campus of Aston University, with a bookshop, studios and exhibition spaces. Shortage of funds meant that not all of the planned facilities were finished, however, and the new more orderly surroundings were felt by some to have compromised the Arts Lab's uniquely liberating culture. The first signs of problems became apparent in 1980 when two members of the music staff were made redundant and Ted Little left to pursue freelance work. The Arts Lab's programme began to focus increasingly on film to the exclusion of other media. In 1982 West Midlands Arts sponsored a move to combine the Arts Lab with Aston University's own Centre for the Arts (with the resultant demise of the Centre for the Arts, which had previously been a popular, thriving, live performance arts venue) as a venue focussing primarily on cinema and photography, and in 1983 the Arts Lab's premises reopened as a new Arts Centre called the Triangle Media and Arts Centre. Funding for this was removed in 1987, however, and the cinema finally closed in 1994. Activities and influence Theatre and performance The Arts Lab's theatre programme was controversial from its start in 1969, with a nude open-air performance on the Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the Birmingham Post. By 1971 there was a regular programme of visiting theatre companies - mainly radical performance art groups such as the People Show, Pip Simmons Theatre Group and John Bull Puncture Repair Kit - together with performances by the Arts Lab's own theatre company Zoo. A regular Theatre Workshop was established from 1973, and the following years saw a series of plays written specifically for the Arts Lab including John Dowie's Stillsmith, Gareth Owen's Confession of Jon-Jak Crusoe and his rock operetta Rupert, Bruce Lacey and Jill Bruce's Stella Superstar and Her Amazing Intergalactic Adventures and most notably David Edgar's Summer Sports, later revived as Blood Sports and still widely performed. Between 1972 and 1976 the Performance Group - based at the Arts Lab but touring internationally - produced a range of shows that combined dance, film, text, poetry, electronics and ambient music; declaring \\"Total Theatre, Mixed or Multimedia, Compound Theatre are all terms we use in this connection\\", and from 1976 the Writers' Theatre Company provided an outlet for the professional production of work by young local writers. The Arts Lab was also notable as a comedy venue, with Stewart Lee crediting Victoria Wood and John Dowie's work at the Arts Lab as being one of the earliest roots of the later alternative comedy movement. Janice Connolly, who later became comedy character Mrs Barbara Nice, performed at Tower Street in a piece directed by John Dowie from a Hunt Emerson cartoon \\"Dog Man\\". Cinema The Arts Lab's cinema programme was established by Tony Jones ‚Äì the first film shown being Medium Cool by Haskell Wexler, which had never before seen in the UK ‚Äì and it continued after the programmes in most other media went into decline from 1980 onwards. The reputation of the Arts Lab's Tower Street venue as \\"the world's most uncomfortable cinema, the silence only broken by the accompaniment of some thrasher on the piano and the timpani of scurrying rats\\" was partly explained by the fact that the seating had been bought second-hand from a local cinema. In addition to its regular programme the Arts Lab held an annual Film Festival from 1972, focussing on particular themes including film makers such as Kenneth Anger, Josef von Sternberg or F. W. Murnau, or 1976's focus on Polish Cinema. Jones left the Arts Lab in 1978 to join the Cambridge Film Theatre. Music The Arts Lab's music programme was defiantly aimed at \\"presenting contemporary music in Birmingham on a regular basis, regardless of the support it may or may not receive\\", starting off with a then-unusual all-Bart√≥k concert by the Lindsay String Quartet. 1970 saw the foundation of the Arts Lab Sound Workshop by Jolyon Laycock, which produced a series of experimental sound performances throughout the 1970s involving improvisation, electronic music, amplification effects and liquid light shows, in regular collaboration with artists such as Cornelius Cardew, David Panton, Trevor Wishart and various ensembles associated with the University of Birmingham, often touring through Europe and North America. Notable premieres included Wishart's Menagerie and Audio Movies. The Arts Lab also developed a reputation as a centre of improvised rock, running from the psychedelia of Bachdenkel in the late 1960s, through the Arts Lab's own Amphioxus jazz-rock ensemble of the mid-seventies, to later collaborative performances at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery. Art, comics and poster art The Arts Lab had a printing operation from its establishment in 1969, set up by Bryan Brown and Simon Chapman whose work was influenced by the psychedelic imagery of the West Coast of America. It initially used silkscreen printing to produce posters for Arts Lab events, and raising funds by producing posters for local Student Unions and music promoters. The posters operation was later taken over by Bob Linney and Ken Meharg for the Arts Lab ‚Äì emphasising simultaneous colour contrasts and the dynamic integration of hand-painted text with manipulated photographic imagery ‚Äì were especially notable, being the subject of an international touring exhibition by the British Council between 1981 and 1985, and an exhibition by Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in 1998. Ernie Hudson was particularly renown for his revolutionary multiple colour silk screen prints produced during this time, notably posters for John Peel at Aston University, and various bands at the time. Although few remain, those that do are archived in Birmingham Museum and Art gallery. In 1970 the Arts Lab obtained an offset litho press on loan from a local cash and carry operation (in return for printing the company's price list for free) and in 1972 bought a second hand press of its own. Initially intended to print flyers and price lists on a commercial basis, the take-over of the printing operation by Hunt Emerson in 1974 saw the Arts Lab move into comic art, producing a series of publications under its own Ar:Zak imprint. Starting with Emerson's own Large Cow Comix ‚Äì which also featured work by Kevin O'Neill and Bryan Talbot ‚Äì and eventually branching out such varied publications as Steve Bell's Big Foot; David Edgar's anti-Nazi Committed Comix and Suzy Varty's Heroine (the first British women's comic), Ar:Zak was to become an important part of the history of underground British comics, a position reinforced when the Arts Lab held KAK ‚Äì the first Konvention of Alternative Komix in 1976.

It was released on January 25, 2008. Production The band recorded the album in Berlin in 2007. It was their first \\"real\\" studio album after recording and releasing a number of songs from Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera in 2006. The band described recording those songs as essential for the existence of StillNo1 as they incorporated many things they learned during their time performing at theaters. Cover art The cover of the album is a version of a painting by Berlin artist Sigurd Wendland. The band planned to find a cover art by visiting art galleries in Berlin Mitte while recording the album but found nothing there that they liked. They discovered Wendland's art by browsing through an arts catalogue afterwards and decided that Wendland's art fits their music style. Wendland was supportive of the band and even asked them whether they would play at his vernissage at Lisbon. Lead singer Chris Neuburger described it as great way to depict the music on StillNo1. Reception German music review site \\"Plattentest\\" gave it 9 out of 10 points and praised the album's departure from the loud, screaming songs on the band's previous 2004 studio album All We Need Is Silence. The review also highlighted positively that the band diversified their usage of musical instruments, departing from their style of using mainly guitar sound which they established on Lookbook (2000) and compares the sound of the album to a variety of different artists, amongst them Radiohead, Depeche Mode, The Divine Comedy, Sigur R√≥s and The Beatles. German music magazine \\"World of Music\\" also praised the album and named it their \\"CD of the month\\" in February 2008. Track list Lyrics Unlike in previous albums, StillNo1 contains lyrics that are addressing a variety of political and sociological topics. Lead singer Chris Neuburger said in an interview that while the band previously had such thoughts, it was the first time they put them into musical form. He went on to say that the music and titles were designed to \\"trick\\" the listener into expecting lyrics that fit the music in a romantic way but instead often contain elements of criticism of the current political and sociological system.

Started in 1931 by Sir Alister Hardy and Sir Cyril Lucas,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1386001/Sir-Cyril-Lucas.html the Survey has provided marine scientists with their only measure of plankton communities on a pan-oceanic scale. Today the CPR Survey is operated by the Marine Biological Association(MBA), located in Plymouth, UK. Uniquely, the CPR Survey‚Äôs methods of sampling and plankton analysis remain unchanged since 1948, providing a spatio-temporally comprehensive > 70 year record of marine plankton dynamics. Sampling and analysis Diagram showing a cutaway view of the CPR, the plankton filtering mechanism, and a photograph of the instrument The CPR is a plankton sampling instrument designed to be towed from merchant ships, or ships of opportunity, on their normal sailings. As of December 31, 2007, CPRs have been towed a total of by 278 ships since the survey‚Äôs inception. Recorders have been towed in all oceans of the world, the Mediterranean, Baltic and North Seas and in freshwater lakes. However, MBA CPR sampling primarily focuses on the northwest European shelf and the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic, with these regions undergoing monthly sampling; regular sampling is also now carried out in the North Pacific. Additionally, sister CPR surveys, not conducted by the MBA but using similar methodology, are operated from the United States, Australia, India, Cyprus, Brazil, South Africa, France and Japan, as part of the Global Alliance of Continuous Plankton Recorder Surveys (www.globalcpr.org) The CPR is towed at a depth of approximately 10 metres. Water passes through the CPR and plankton are filtered onto a slow-moving band of silk (270 micrometre mesh size) and covered by a second silk. The silks and plankton are then spooled into a storage tank containing formalin. On return to the laboratory, the silk is removed from the mechanism and divided into samples representing of tow. CPR samples are analyzed in two ways. Firstly, the Phytoplankton Colour Index (PCI) is determined for each sample. The colour of the silk is evaluated against a standard colour chart and given a 'green-ness' value based on the visual discoloration of the CPR silk produced by green chlorophyll pigments; the PCI is a semi-quantitative estimate of phytoplankton biomass. In this way the PCI takes into account the chloroplasts of broken cells and small phytoplankton which cannot be counted during the microscopic analysis stage. After determination of the PCI, microscopic analysis is undertaken for each sample, and individual phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa are identified and counted. Nearly 500 phyto- and zooplankton taxa have been identified on CPR samples since 1948. Ecological research Due to its long time-series, comprehensive spatial coverage and methodological consistency, the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey is a unique ecological dataset which has provided invaluable insights into numerous aspects of plankton dynamics and ecology. Key areas of research include: *Climate change *Biodiversity and biogeography *Eutrophication *Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) *Fisheries investigations *Plankton ecology *Taxonomy *Regime shifts *Non-indigenous species Their research results show that warmer water species of plankton are moving northwards towards the colder North Atlantic at a rate of about per year and that some plankton species have moved north over the course of 50 years due to regional climate warming. But they are not replacing the cold water species in similar abundance. The open oceans are not yet subject to eutrophication or changes due to acidification though the number of microplastics collected on CPR samples is increasing. It has detected a new species in the North Atlantic which may be the first evidence of Trans-Arctic species migration in modern times.

It was first published in 1956. It chronicles the perspective of a teenage girl entering her first romantic relationship. The book captures the innocent spirit of life in the 1950s, both through the playfully light storyline and the casual references to convertibles, sweaters, \\"meeting boys\\", and soda shops. Regardless, the book remains in print today because its overall theme of difficult adolescent feelings still connects with young readers. Plot Jane Purdy is a 15-year-old student at Woodmont High School in California. She dreams of having a boyfriend like blonde, popular, and sophisticated 16-year- old Marcy Stokes has. Jane feels somewhat left out of social circles at her high school, and envies the more popular girls who go out on dates, seem more confident and wear more expensive clothes. One day while babysitting, Jane meets 16-year-old Stan Crandall, who is a delivery boy for a pet-food store. Jane is immediately attracted to Stan, although she does not believe that he will be attracted to her, because she is ordinary. However, Stan calls her later and asks her out on a date to the movies. After school begins, Jane learns that Stan has another date named Bitsy for the first school dance. Jane is extremely upset, but it turns out that Stan asked Bitsy to the dance before he met Jane and he feels he can't break the date. After the dance, Stan tells Jane about his time with Bitsy, saying that she made fun of his job. Stan turned pale before saying goodbye to Jane. Later, Julie calls Jane on the phone to tell her Stan was rushed to the hospital and had his appendix out. In the end, Stan reassures Jane that she's his girlfriend, and gives her his ID bracelet as a symbol that they are going steady.

The game was developed and published by Tokuma Shoten. Eternal Filena was released late into the Super Famicom's life, but despite this it had somewhat dated graphics that were reminiscent of Final Fantasy V and a battle system similar to Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. The game's story begins with Filena, a girl raised as a boy by her grandfather Zenna. Filena is raised as a boy because the Empire ruling the country forces girls into prostitution and turns boys into gladiators. After turning sixteen, Filena prepares to make her debut in the imperial coliseum, however before the battle she and her fellow gladiators are assigned concubines. Filena ignores her assigned bedmate, Lila, but Lila forces her way into Filena's room and learns the truth about her gender. Filena later fights through the gladiator ranks and discovers that their battles to the death are all scripted by behind-the-scenes writers. Filena then sets off with Lila on a quest to bring down an empire and reclaim her rightful place in a lost kingdom. The gameplay is typical of role-playing video games of its time, using a turn-based battle system with random encounters with monsters to gain experience and level up. Characters can equip up to three weapons and switch between them. Weapons have different abilities and a character can perform a technique at the cost of ability points. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the game a 23 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: Ê∞∏ÈÅ†„ÅÆ„Éï„Ç£„É¨„Éº„Éä. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.324. Pg.44. 3 March 1995.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, Toronto Blue Jays, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Baseball career College Coke attended San Joaquin Delta College. He was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 49th round (1450th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. Minor leagues He was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 26th round (786th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, and did sign. He began his baseball career with the GCL Yankees in 2003. By 2007, Coke had also pitched for the short season Staten Island Yankees, Class-A Charleston RiverDogs, and Class-A Advanced Tampa Yankees. He made his Double-A debut with the Trenton Thunder in 2008, going 9‚Äì4 with a 2.54 earned run average (ERA) in 23 games (20 starts). Later that year in Triple-A with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, he pitched in 13 games (starting one) and went 2‚Äì2 with a 4.67 ERA. New York Yankees He made his major league debut on September 1, 2008, for the Yankees against the Detroit Tigers with a scoreless inning and strikeouts of Curtis Granderson and Miguel Cabrera. In 2009, Coke got his first World Series title after the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. Detroit Tigers On December 9, 2009, Coke was traded to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade that sent Curtis Granderson to the Yankees. Coke's first season in Detroit proved to be successful, as he finished 2010 with a 3.76 ERA (his career best to date) with 17 holds and 2 saves in 21 hold/save situations. The Tigers signed Coke to a new contract on February 7, 2011. After spending all of his previous time in the major leagues as a relief pitcher, Coke was moved from the bullpen to the fifth spot in the starting rotation to start the 2011 season. On June 30, after accumulating a 1‚Äì8 record, Coke was moved back to the bullpen. He would finish 2011 with a 3‚Äì9 record and a 4.47 ERA. On January 16, 2012, Coke signed a one-year, $1.1 million deal with the Tigers to avoid arbitration. He was eligible to earn an additional $50,000 based on appearances in the 2012 season. Despite a season in which he posted a 4.00 ERA and a 1.65 WHIP, Coke was the Tiger's most reliable reliever in the 2012 postseason. Pressed into duty as the team's closer on October 14, 2012 after regular season closer Jos√© Valverde surrendered seven runs in his previous two appearances, Phil pitched two shutout innings in Game 2 of the 2012 ALCS against the Yankees to earn a save, then saved Game 3 by striking out Ra√∫l Iba√±ez on a 3‚Äì2 slider to preserve a 2‚Äì1 victory after allowing back-to-back two-out singles. In Game 4, Coke pitched two perfect innings to finish off the Tigers' 8‚Äì1 win over his former team and send Detroit to the World Series for the first time in six years. In the 2012 World Series, Coke pitched innings, allowing one run, but that run came in the top of the 10th inning of Game 4 and was the game and series winner for the Champion San Francisco Giants. This came after Coke had struck out the side in the top of the 9th inning which, coupled with his appearances in Games 2 and 3 of the series, gave him a World Series record seven consecutive strikeouts. Coke finished the 2012 postseason allowing one run in innings (0.84 ERA) and striking out 13 batters. Coke struggled throughout the 2013 season, failing to thrive as either a setup man or a lefty specialist. Tossing only innings on the year, Phil's ERA ballooned to a career-high 5.40. On August 20, 2013, after an outing against the Minnesota Twins that typified Coke's ineffectiveness this season, the Tigers demoted him to their Triple-A farm club in Toledo, subsequently promoting left-handed pitcher Jos√© √Ålvarez to the major league roster. In 2014, his final season with the Tigers, Coke posted a 5‚Äì2 record with 41 strikeouts and a 3.88 ERA in 58 innings pitched. Chicago Cubs In March 2015, Coke signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs, receiving a non-roster invitation to spring training. Coke earned a $2.25 million salary upon making the team. Coke had a 6.30 ERA in 16 appearances, allowing left-handed batters to hit .304 (7-for-23) against him. He was designated for assignment by the Cubs on May 18, and released by the club on May 26. Toronto Blue Jays On May 30, 2015, Coke signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays, and was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.

It was owned by former NASCAR driver Phil Parsons, and most recently fielded the No. 98 Ford for Josh Wise. The team was formerly owned by Phil's wife Marcia as well as Randy and Stacey Humphrey (hence the original name MSRP: Marcia, Stacey, Randy, Phil). For the first few years of its Nationwide Series and Sprint Cup operations, the team was infamous for being a start and park organization, meaning that the team qualified a car for races, but eventually parked it after just a few laps to avoid the costs of running a full race, even though the car is perfectly able to continue on.Rob Zeller, \\"The Quitting Game\\", Car and Driver, Feb. 2009, pp. 96‚Äì100. The bad publicity generated by the practice led Phil Parsons to refuse to answer questions about MSRP in 2008, but subsequently Parsons justified the practice by saying that \\"we furnished a living for some families, so there was some good that came out of it.\\" In 2009, MSRP continued with two Nationwide Series teams and finally finished a race, while it also added a Sprint Cup team under the Prism Motorsports name that qualified for 30 races but only finished two. After the season, the entire team became known as Prism Motorsports. In 2010, the team had two Sprint Cup teams, No. 55 and No. 66, led by drivers Michael McDowell and Dave Blaney, which fielded Toyota Camrys under a technical alliance with MWR. Three drivers rotated among the two Nationwide Series cars (90 and 91) in 2010: Danny O'Quinn Jr., David Gilliland, and Chase Miller. Car No. 55 crew chief Zach McGowan tweeted on November 18 that the team would be shutting down after the 2010 season-ending race at Homestead,PRISM might be gone? - Rubbin's Racin' Nov. 18th, 2010: \\"Our team will be shutting down after this week. I hate it for our guys. I have enjoyed working everyone. We all made the best out of bad situation. Good luck to everyone.\\" - Zach McGowan. but this was denied by team owner Randy Humphrey.Prism Motorsports to shut down operations; maybe not? Jayski, Nov. 20, 2010. No information is available regarding PRISM's Nationwide teams. The team returned in 2011 as HP Racing with McDowell behind the wheel of the No. 66 Toyota with Gene Nead as crew chief. Unlike 2009, the team intended to run a limited schedule, running only a few full races but ended up running the full schedule. The team ran with Ford for 2012 and 2013 before switching to Chevrolet for the 2014 season. The team and driver Josh Wise gained popularity in 2014 after an internet campaign with Dogecoin and Reddit, leading the 98 to be voted into the 2014 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race. Sprint Cup Series Car No. 55 history Michael McDowell in the No. 55 during the 2010 Coca-Cola 600 For 2010, Prism Motorsports added a second car provided by Michael Waltrip Racing, the No. 55, driven by former team driver Michael McDowell. The car number had previously been used by Michael Waltrip from 2007 to 2009. Randy Humphrey was listed as the car's official owner. At the start of the season, Prism had no sponsorship for this car. McDowell succeeded in qualifying the No. 55 into the starting field for the 2010 Daytona 500. After qualifying, McDowell said that this was the \\"biggest race of the season\\" for Prism, as the guaranteed winnings would enable the team to stay on the track for several weeks. McDowell qualified 29th, picked up sponsorship from South Carolina-based Firefly Vodka, and finished 33rd after a drive shaft issue. McDowell and teammate Dave Blaney swapped rides at Phoenix and Texas in an effort to get the team higher in owner points. Michael Waltrip drove the No. 55 at Talladega with Aaron's sponsorship to a poor finish after getting caught up in a wreck, but was running up front and was at one point leading the race. Mike Bliss drove the car after McDowell left the team. When Terry Labonte's car failed to qualify at Richmond, he took over as the driver of the No. 55, taking sponsor Gander Mountain with him. Terry Cook later attempted to qualify the car at Martinsville, but failed to do so. Waltrip would later return, along with sponsor Aaron's to the No. 55 at the fall Talladega race. The No. 55 car did not enter the fall Texas race, possibly because of the large number of entries attempting to qualify. It was also absent on the entry list for Homestead. Car No. 98 history =2009‚Äì2010: Prism Motorsports= The No. 66 at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 2009 The No. 98 car was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team that debuted in 2009 as the No. 66 under a technical alliance with MWR, which supplied the team's Toyota Camry, engines and technical support.\\"Waltrip says alliance with Prism Motorsports helpful\\", NASCAR, 4 February 2009. Terry Labonte ran the No. 66 for the 2009 Daytona 500, where he finished 24th. Dave Blaney ran the rest of the season, except for the Aarons 499 at Talladega as he was away with his family. Michael McDowell attempted to qualify for the event but failed to do so. According to Blaney, Prism had anticipated attempting to run all of the laps in \\"six or eight\\" Sprint Cup races in which the team was able to secure full sponsorship, which included Window World for the Daytona 500 and Aaron's for the Coca-Cola 600. The Denny Hamlin Foundation was on the car at Lowes Motor Speedway, Talladega and Texas, with Blaney only making the race at Talladega. Ultimately, the team qualified for 31 of the 36 Sprint Cup races in the 2009 season ‚Äì 30 by Blaney and 1 by Labonte‚Äîbut only ran two complete races (the Daytona 500 and the Coca-Cola 600). For the remainder of 2009, the No. 66 car was a start and park team, much like their Nationwide Series counterparts. Blaney returned to the No. 66 in 2010. Again, Prism struggled with sponsorship, as it was unable to find a sponsor for the team for even the 2010 Daytona 500, and Blaney subsequently failed to qualify for it. Blaney made the team's first race of the year in the 2010 Auto Club 500, qualifying fifth, leading four laps before finishing 41st. The 66 was later impounded by NASCAR. The team was able to rebound from the impound, and ran the whole entire race, finishing 29th at the Shelby American. Blaney left the team after Watkins Glen, and Scott Riggs took over the No. 66 for the next four races, qualifying only once at Bristol Motor Speedway, Likewise, Jason Leffler drove the No. 66 for four races, only qualifying at Auto Club Speedway. Johnny Sauter failed to make each of the three races he attempted with the team, and Mike Bliss drove the car at Texas and Homestead. While the 66 team frequently start-and-parked, it occasionally showed competitive speed. Blaney qualified 8th, 4th, and 3rd at the 2009 Food City 500, the 2009 Sharpie 500, and the 2010 Food City 500, respectively (all at Bristol), as well as a 5th place start spot at the 2009 Auto Club 500, though the team finished 41st or worst in all four races. =2011: HP Racing= For 2011, McDowell returned to the team, now renamed HP Racing. The team missed the 2011 Daytona 500, but started and parked the next three races. HP ran its first full race at Martinsville, where the team finished 32nd after a late wreck. KLOVE sponsored the team at Richmond and Darlington. Todd Bodine drove at both Pocono and Michigan in August, while Josh Wise took over the 66 at Texas while McDowell filled in for Kyle Busch, who was suspended for intentionally wrecking another driver during the Truck Series race. =2012‚Äì2015: PPR with Mike Curb= Josh Wise in the No. 98 at Sonoma Raceway in 2014 For 2012, McDowell returned to the team, renamed Phil Parsons Racing. The team also merged with Whitney Motorsports and partnered with entertainment icon Mike Curb. The team ran Fords with Roush Yates Engines and used the number 98 to honor the memory of Benny Parsons. Phil Parsons Racing planned to run the first 5 races in their entirety with the hope of cracking the top 35. The 98 raced their way into the Daytona 500, with sponsorship from Curb Records and Christian radio station KLOVE. McDowell finished 30th after starting 11th in the 2012 Daytona 500. McDowell ran all but six races during the season, failing to qualify for three of them. The team opened the 2013 season with a ninth-place finish at the Daytona 500, the first top ten finish for the team and for McDowell. Phil Parsons Racing withdrew from Phoenix after the team could not prepare the Generation 6 cars in time. They would later skip the road courses as well. Mike Curb is listed as the owner of the 98. McDowell left after the 2013 season and Josh Wise took over as the team switched to Chevrolet for all but the superspeedway events, where they used Fords. In March 2014, Reddit users started a fundraiser to raise Dogecoin to sponsor the No. 98 at the Aaron's 499. On March 25, Reddit user Reddit_Racing announced that the fundraiser was a success, having met their $50,000 goal by accumulating 67 million Dogecoin. Florida gubernatorial candidate and Democrat Charlie Crist was to sponsor the No. 98 for the July 5 Coke Zero 400 at Daytona, the sponsorship provided by former owner James Finch, but was withdrawn by Parsons to respect his business partner Mike Curb, a Republican. Wise returned to PPR for the 2015 season. Finch would once again provide sponsorship to the team in the Daytona 500, this time through his company Phoenix Construction. However, the car suffered a terminal mechanical failure before the green flag flew on their Budweiser Duel, and PPR ultimately missed the Daytona 500 for the first time since 2011. However, the team has been able to qualify for every race since then. Wise scored a top 10 in the 2015 GEICO 500 at Talladega. Before the 2015 Coca-Cola 600, Parsons and Curb sold the team's assets and Wise's contract to Premium Motorsports and the team shut down. Nationwide Series Car No. 90 history The No. 90 first raced in the season-opening Daytona 300 in 2008 with former Nationwide Series champion Steve Grissom driving. Grissom did not qualify in on time, but fell back on his Champion's Provisional. At Auto Club Speedway, Scott Lynch drove the No. 90. At Las Vegas, 2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Champion Todd Bodine drove. Finally, at Atlanta the team found a full-time driver in Johnny Chapman. Chapman has run every race since Atlanta aside from the road courses, where both driving school instructor Chris Cook and NASCAR Canadian Tire Series driver Don Thomson, Jr. have been in the seat. The team's best finish was 36th, with a best qualifying effort of 29th by Chris Cook at Watkins Glen. At Lowe's Motor Speedway the team failed to qualify when Chapman crashed during qualifying. Chapman again started and parked the No. 90 for most of the races in 2009. In 2010, MSRP has teamed up with D'Hondt Motorsports with Danny O'Quinn Jr. as the driver (they are still start and park), however they ran the race at Road America with Patrick Long racing. Long led two laps and finished 14th. The team has since suspended operations. Car No. 91 history The No. 91 team of MSRP Motorsports had its share of drivers since its debut at Daytona in 2008. Larry Gunselman failed to qualify at Daytona, but made the next nine races with a best finish of 38th at Las Vegas. He was released after destroying the team's only Superspeedway car in a wreck that broke IRL champion Dario Franchitti's ankle. After Gunselman's departure, Kenny Hendrick drove the car at Richmond and Lowe's. Truck Series veteran Terry Cook took over running four races beginning with Darlington and ending with Indianapolis. Cook's best finish was 41st on three occasions, but his best qualifying effort was 16th at the famed Milwaukee Mile. He was replaced by Justin Hobgood, who ran six races with a best finish of 38th and failed to qualify three times, including at Loudon, where he wrecked the car. On the two road courses, veterans Scott Steckly and Michael McDowell drove the car. In 2009, Terry Cook was the main driver for the No. 91, which was occasionally sponsored by Cajun Industries, LLC. Although the team under Cook had been leading practices and qualifying in the top 15 many times, its lack of funding meant that it had to continue to start and park. At Watkins Glen, Dave Blaney qualified for the race in 20th place and finished the race in the 13th position with sponsorship from SFP (the sponsor for Peyton Sellers' No. 77 Chevy who failed to make the race), marking the first time MSRP finished a race in the Nationwide Series. In 2010, MSRP teamed up with D'Hondt Motorsports (who ran a race in 2008 with Kyle Busch as the driver) and Stephen Leicht is the driver. The team has since suspended operations.

Based on an eponymous 1978 science fiction novel by Jeffrey Caine, the film stars George Segal, Amanda Pays (in her film debut), Anthony Higgins, Ren√©e Soutendijk, and Warren Clarke. The original film score is by Michael Nyman. It was a production of MCEG/Sterling Entertainment and released on VHS by Charter Entertainment. Plot Carla Martin (Amanda Pays) is leaving an English parochial boarding school for the summer to live with her estranged father at an inn in East Berlin. The headmistress (Ursula Howells), a nun, gives her a 1936 guide to Berlin, telling Carla that she may find it useful, even though Berlin has surely changed as much as she has. Her best friend, Sophie (Lucy Hornack), gives her a bag of marijuana. Hugh Martin (George Segal), her father, who lives on Central Park West, greets her at the Berlin Airport, surprised at how grown she looks. Carla is a bit embarrassed that he has given her a teddy bear, as she is nearly seventeen years old. She addresses him on a first name basis, and a camera pan reveals that he just bought the teddy bear at the airport. As they cross through the Berlin Wall, Carla is terrified that she will be personally searched and caught with drugs. Hugh has a thirty-year- old girlfriend named Lili (Ren√©e Soutendijk), who recommends Frau Hoffman's (Elizabeth Spriggs) inn because of the local character being significant to Hugh's historical research. Carla is convinced that there are rats behind the wall and wants to leave. Hugh has Frau Hoffman humour her and show her that there is merely a broom closet next door, though that room is not deep enough to convince her. Hugh insists it's probably just part of the next room. Carla sees flashes of another girl in the wardrobe mirror, starts tapping the wall behind it and gets taps back, and tearing away at the wallpaper, she opens the wall to find a disused cold room, for the hotel was once a butcher's shop and home, and a Jewish dissident named Erich (Anthony Higgins) hiding inside. She begins sneaking him food from the hotel kitchen, along with utensils and her father's razor, to help him. Carla is experiencing two realities, one in the 1980s when she is Carla Martin and another in 1936, when she is Christa Bruckner. Christa is the daughter of butcher Wilhelm Bruckner (Warren Clarke), a member of the Nazi Party who calls her a \\"little slut\\" and rapes her in the night. Christa also has lines of cuts in both of her palms. Carla is ashamed by the rape and scrubs herself thoroughly in the bathtub. Hugh is concerned that Carla may be going insane like her mother did and finally makes good on his insistence at having her seen by a doctor (George Pravda). When the doctor comes, she has stripped the sheets on her bed for their dirtiness and is not wearing anything under the bed covers, so her father steps out for the examination. The doctor cannot find anything wrong, and when she tells him that her father raped her the night before and asks him to examine her, he sees only inflammation from the scrub brush and identifies her as virgo intacta‚Äîshe was not raped. Christa and Erich begin lovemaking, as Christa fears she is pregnant by her father and psychologically needs to have the possibility that any baby born is Erich's. She carves their names into a cross centred on the letter I on the wall of the cold room. Soon after, Hugh finds her huddled in a nightgown inside the wardrobe, which is filled with rotten food. Hugh and Lili get her dressed and take her out of the hotel. As they are getting into the car, Herr Bruckner drags her back into the butcher shop and insists he needs her for deliveries. In reality, this is to give Frau Hoffman time to reveal Erich to the Gestapo. When they return, Moltke (Clifford Rose), who had previously interrogated her about a visit to a Jewish man referred to her by Erich (something Carla was not able to accomplish in her own experience), is waiting in her bedroom. Erich shot one of Moltke's men, and Moltke killed him. Hugh and Lili carry Carla back to the room with Frau Hoffman's assistance. When Carla regains consciousness, she begins accusing Frau Hoffman of having killed Erich. Not being able to tell Hugh from Herr Bruckner, she stabs him in the chest near the shoulder with a knife she has hidden. Coming to her senses, she and Lili ride with him in the ambulance. Hugh now with his arm in a sling, the police are called to open the wall behind the wardrobe, which Carla had never actually opened. The planks Herr Bruckner had sealed it up with are removed, and Carla investigates it, filled with rats as she initially suspected, discovering the place where Christa and Erich's names are carved into the wall. Frau Hoffman is unable to hide her shame. Hugh takes Carla back to the airport to live with her aunt, with whom she lived prior to boarding school.

The locality is about south-east of the town of Beaconsfield. The 2016 census has a population of 6472 for the state suburb of Riverside. It is a residential suburb 5 kilometres (2.5 mi) north-west of the central business district of Launceston, Tasmania's second largest city. The West Tamar Highway runs through the suburb, adjoining Riverside to the West Tamar, which includes small towns: Beaconsfield, George Town and Beauty Point. Riverside is part of the West Tamar Council local government area. The suburb is now Launceston's largest by population, narrowly ahead of Kings Meadows. The main shopping centre opened in the 1960s and includes: a Woolworths supermarket, a Banjos bakery, a pharmacist and several retail shops. History Riverside was gazetted as a locality in 1958. Geography The Tamar River forms the north- eastern boundary and part of the south-eastern. The South Esk River also forms part of the south-eastern. Road infrastructure The West Tamar Highway (A7) passes through from south-east to north-east. Route C734 (Ecclestone Road) starts at an intersection with A7 and runs south-west and west until it exits.  Facilities  Launceston Football club, Windsor ParkThere are several schools (Riverside Primary School, Riverside High School, Launceston Christian School and St Anthony's) as well as an Aussie rules football ground named Windsor Park which is home to the Launceston Football Club, a soccer ground which is home to Riverside Olympic, the park also includes a cricket ground for senior players and also a junior ground used mainly by under 12 and under 14 sides, all along the course of the highway. Less than a 1 km (0.6 mi) further north there is a small complex containing a few shops including Joes IGA supermarket and St David's Church. Over the road is a restaurant, pub and bottle shop, as well as the 3.5 star Best Western Riverside motel. Though mostly built in the 1960s, Riverside contains a wide range of buildings, with older brick and weatherboard style homes prominent along the West Tamar Highway and area's closer to the city, many of which being either Edwardian or Art Deco in style, while more modern homes are located in the western and northern areas. Few buildings in Riverside date from the 1800s, though the notable exception being Cormiston House, a former estate house from the mid-1800s, located on a large property at the northern extremity of Riverside. The western half of Riverside, accessed by Pomona Road, was built in the 1950s as the hydro-electric village of Marrawaylee to serve the construction of the Trevallyn Power Station. Now known as West Riverside, this minor suburb contains a single shop, the St Francis Church as well as the old hydro lodge, now modified into a private residence. The northwestern region of West Riverside has recently been the site of Riverside's most rapid urban growth, with new suburbs now connected onto Pomona Road North, Guildford Road, Tamar Rise and Balmoral Avenue.

Bellefield Boiler Plant, also known as \\"The Cloud Factory\\" from its nickname's use in Michael Chabon's 1988 debut novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, is a boiler plant located in Junction Hollow (referred to as \\"The Lost Neighborhood\\" in Chabon's book) between the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University in the Oakland district of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Built in 1907 to provide steam heat for Carnegie Museum, it was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by the architectural firm Longfellow, Alden & Harlow. The 1907 smoke stack measured 150 feet (removed in 2010), and the newer stack (unknown built year) is more than 200 feet. The plant has burned both coal and natural gas but stopped burning coal on July 1, 2009. Its steam system expanded in the 1930s to service the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning. Today it pumps heat to most of the major buildings in Oakland. It is owned by a consortium made up of the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Carnegie Mellon University, the Carnegie Museum, the City of Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Public Schools. During its coal burning years, the plant could consume up to a 70-ton hopper car of coal per day, delivered by the Pittsburgh Junction Railroad (now in the P&W; Subdivision of CSX) that ran through Junction Hollow next to the plant.

The standard is intended for defining user interfaces that can gracefully scale on a variety of screen sizes and geometries, including those of mobile devices to high definition television sets. CE-HTML is part of the CEA-2014 standard (also referred to as \\"Web4CE\\" which is short for Web for Consumer Electronics), defined within the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). Features CE-HTML consists of the following internet languages: * ECMAScript 262, 3rd edition * XHTML 1.0 transitional/stricthttp://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xhtml1-20020801/ XHTML 1.0 transitional/strict * CSS TV Profile 1.0 * XMLHttpRequest object * DOM level 2.0 (Core, Style, Events, HTML) * a number of specific extensions for CE devices. CE-HTML can both be used in-home through UPnP as via the Internet. It allows the content creator to use the common and known languages in the web to define a user interface that can be controlled on a CE device. A CE-HTML client typically consists of a web browser adapted for the CE-HTML standard running on a consumer electronics device. CE-HTML offers specific extensions for these browsers such as : * Multi-tap or other CE-specific alpha-numeric input support, by making use of the CSS3 input-format tag. * Media (audio/video) playout through the use of an audio/video scripting object. * Operation via remote control (spatial navigation) using the up, down, left, right and OK keys * Client capability matching ‚Äì to match the client capabilities to the user interfaces that the server offers. For this purpose, each CE-HTML compliant client is making use of a capability profile. This profile, placed in the user-agent string of the client, lets the server know what part of CE-HTML is supported by the client. The server in turn transmits its capabilities in a so-called \\"XML UI Listing\\" so the client can choose between the various CE-HTML user interfaces the server offers. * User interface profiles for usage on CE devices such as a television. These are predefined capability profiles on which a CE-HTML client can base its capabilities. They define e.g. the fonts supported, screen-size of the device and the media that is supported by the a/v scripting object in the device. All profiles are based on a 10-foot user interface. * Third-party notifications which allow a client to poll for messages from an external server, and display these to the user regardless of the currently displayed user interface. * A specific new MIME-type for CE-HTML content: \\"application/ce-html+xml\\".

Use  CE-HTML is increasingly used within other standards, such as the Open IPTV Forum, the Digital Living Network Alliance (as of version 2) and HbbTV. Some research suggests that CEA-2014 (of which CE-HTML is an important part) will be one of the key technologies in the living room internet experience.World Wide Web ensnaring the living room There are currently a number of browser vendors and solution providers that claim to have a CE-HTML capable browser, such as Oregan developed by Oregan Networks Ltd and the Wedison projecthttp://www.wedison.org Wedison project information which is based on Webkit.

History Ravenswood was first settled in the early nineteenth century as a small farming area. The first official valuation of properties in the district took place in 1858. For some years after the arrival of the pioneers, there was only one road to Launceston across a ford at St. Leonards. There were no bridges. The farmers went by horseback to Launceston to sell their fruit, butter, eggs and vegetables. There is very little about the area indexed at the Archives Office in Tasmania, but what information there is supports the claim that the Ravenswood district took its name from the property owned by David McGown on Distillery Creek. As well as already obtaining grants of land from the Government, Mr McGown purchased 2000 acres and another 30 acres at Distillery Creek from Henry Prialux, the original grantee, in February, 1836, for the sum of two thousand pounds. He called his property at Distillery Creek \\"Ravenswood\\". Later he named the area near his home \\"Roslyn\\". His first home on the property was, unfortunately, burnt. Ultimately the district became known as Ravenswood. In 1838, Mr. McGown stated evidence to the Distillation Committee that he had carried on business as a Distiller for 14 years in Scotland and for 6 years in the colony at the site, Distillery Creek. On 19 May 1838, the Cornwall Chronicle carried a warning to trespassers not to allow cattle on the property of \\"Ravenswood\\", the property of D. McGown (known as Priaulx's grant). It was in 1840, according to the Cornwall Chronicle that he offered \\"Ravenswood\\" and the \\"Caledonian Will\\" for sale. In 1858 and 1868 the assessment rolls showed John Faulkner as occupier of the house with garden and land owned by D. McGown's trustees, agent - James Scott. \\"Distillery Creek\\" received its name for an obvious reason. The Caledonian Distillery, sometimes known as Towers' Distillery, was built on Mr. McGown's property and was conducted by his brother - in - law, James Towers, whose brother, Robert, operated the semaphore station at Windmill Hill. Nearby settlers used to bring their grain to the mill. They received in return bottles of whiskey which were passed to them through spaces between horizontal bars firmly set in wall openings. The water used for distilling was piped from a spring in the hills above. On the opposite side of Distillery Creek near the site of the home of Mr and Mrs D. Brooks, there was once a flour mill called Harden Mill, built in 1857 to the order of James Scott, the surveyor and son-in-law of D. McGown. He lived in \\"Bowhill\\", Glen Dhu, behind Coats Patons' Mill. In 1868 Gaunt and Co. were occupiers and James Scott was still owner. By 1892 James Marshall was the operator. An illustration of \\"Marshall's Mill\\" may be found in records in the local history room at the Northern Regional Library. Later it was sold to Robert Hogarth. Finally, in 1932, it was demolished because there were large cracks in the walls and it was considered unsafe. An early map shows four adjoining properties owned by Jame McNally, Francis Bourke, Richard Dry and Dalrymple Keating. These properties were purchased on 31 July 1883, by Ameia Dean, wife of George B. Dean owner of the Phoenix Bakery, St John Street, Launceston. The farm \\"Hiawatha Farm\\", was first used as a run for horses which drew the bread delivery carts. The farm extended to what we now know as Ravenswood Road. Gradually, small sections have been sold to make way for Launceston City Council initiated developments, e.g. flood prevention, a section of Bell Bay railway, housing and the present school. In December, 1914, an agreement was drawn up between Amelia Dean and a solicitor, Louis Page, to have a bridge built across the North Esk River at Henry Street. Louise Page was to have the bridge built in return for 20 acres of land from Amelia Dean. The conditions were that the bridge had to be above the level of the highest flood, (it withstood the flood of 1929), that it be completed in nine months and that it be substantial enough to bear the weight of traction engines and other machinery. Roads approaching it were to be completed in twelve months. The bridge was replaced by the Launceston City Council in 1968. Another bridge, the first, was built by George Hobler, who had land at South Ravenswood, bound by the North Esk. He obtained permission from the Government to build a bridge over the river at his own expense. This was the first Hobler's bridge. George's property was known as \\"Killafaddy\\". Since then, two more bridges of the same name have been built and each has been in a different place. According to one source, two of the best known early settlers were the Towse brothers, who emigrated from England. It has been suggested that their property was named \\"Ravenswood\\", after their property in their homeland but Archives did not reveal any evidence to substantiate this. Their first home was built of stone. A small church was built on the corner of Wildor Crescent and Henry Street (now demolished). The Towse brothers were buried in the cemetery nearby. Other tombstones bear the names of Faulkner, Gipton, Elmore and Hodgson. Timber split in the bush and hauled by bullocks was used to build a small hall on Mr. Gipton's property. The renovated building, now the Ravenswood Gospel Chapel is in front of the original Gipton house. Quite a few of the early homes, like Mr. Gipton's, were made of large blocks of stone. At one time there were six such homes facing Launceston. Mr Bird and Mr Tattersall both lived in stone houses near the recreation ground and Mr S. Leslie lived in another near the reservoir. Names of other early settlers not mentioned elsewhere are Boag, Luck, Lawrence, Goodyer, Rankin, Olding, Bradshaw, Chandler. Land holders shown on an early map were Kealing, Dry, Burke, McNalley, Stonehouse, Mackey, E. Wench, Snell, whose holdings were \\"located\\". D. McGown, C. Swan, H. Chapman, T. Learmonth and H. Jennings were \\"granted\\" land. The first school was built on land given by Robert Gipton, who migrated from Ireland, he married Miss Towse. The building of the first school consisted of one school room with an attached residence of four rooms and a sun room. The structure was at the rear of Mr Spataro's house in Henry Street. Children came from as far as Rocherlea, Mowbray, Vermont, Prosser's Forest and Russell's Plains, Waverley and Newstead. The enrolment at one time reached 60. The school was closed in 1940 because of diminishing numbers. Mr R. K. Jones was the last principal. The building itself was re-erected at Ogilvie Park where it serves as a caretakers residence. The flag which was used at the first school in Ravenswood was donated to the present primary school by Mrs R. K. Jones. Facilities Ravenswood has the following facilities: *Two shopping centres *Police station *Volunteer Fire Station *Skate park *Hotel *Over 50's club *Community health centre *Community centre *Pharmacy *Library *Bakery *Neighbourhood house *Newsagent *Church *IGA Supermarket *Bowls club *Op Shop *Bike Museum *Mamas CAF Education Ravenswood's population expanded rapidly in the 1970s and in 1976 a high school opened under the Principal Peter Brooker. The school population peaked in 1979 - 1984 when around 700 students from grades 7 to 10 attended the first open plan high school in Tasmania. Over the years the school population declined and by the early 1990s the High School was considered for amalgamation. Ravenswood now has two schools, including Ravenswood Heights which formed at the end of the 1996 school year after the amalgamation of the three local schools Ravenswood High, Ravenswood Primary and East Ravenswood Primary. After the amalgamation Ravenswood Primary was closed and later re-opened as a special school. While Ravenswood High became the senior campus for grades 6-10 with East Ravenswood becoming the junior campus for grades 1-5 as well as having a kindergarten. The senior campus closed at the end of 1999 after many years of low enrolments, leaving remaining students to choose between nearby Brooks High School at Rocherlea or Queechy High School at Norwood.

The programme was terminated during 1987 without any production aircraft having been produced.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/germany-reveals- secret-stealth-fighter-research-22117/ As early as 1975, West Germany is known to have conducted research into the field of stealth aircraft. During 1981, work commenced at MBB on developing a design for a viable stealth aircraft; the effort was supported by a contract that had been issued by the German Air Force. Also known as the Medium Range Missile Fighter (MRMF), it had been conceived that a fighter could be both lighter and cheaper if it was so superior at mid-range combat as to allow it to discard the requirement to perform close-range combat. Having been developed independently of other stealth aircraft, such as the American Lockheed Corporation's Have Blue technical demonstrator and its follow-up F-117 Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft, the Lampyridae nonetheless used a similar approach to achieving its low-observable characteristics. After determining the Lampyridae's design to be viable, development activity proceeded to the construction of a single three-quarter scale piloted aircraft. During 1985, wind tunnel testing of the design, including at transonic speeds commenced; two years later, a number of manned 'flights' inside the wind tunnel were performed, during which the favourable high-quality aerodynamic properties of the design were documented. During 1987, the existence of the Lampyridae project and its design was revealed to the United States in the form of a group of United States Air Force (USAF) officers, who were shown the piloted model, which was kept in a closed-off section of MBB's manufacturing facility at Ottobrunn, Bavaria, Germany. That same year, the Lampyridae project was terminated for unspecified reasons; diplomatic pressure on the part of the US has been attributed. Development Background During the 1970s and 1980s, several nations, having recognised the potential strategic value of low-observably, commenced research into the application of such technologies with the aim of developing viable stealth aircraft for military purposes. During this time, American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Corporation was developing such aircraft in the form of the Have Blue technical demonstrator along with a subsequent production type in the form of the F-117 Nighthawk, a stealthy strike aircraft. Amongst the other nations working on such matters was West Germany; as early as 1975, the country had commenced its own independent research efforts into the field.Hasik 2008, p. 47.

This programme, which has been mainly known by the name Lampyridae (Latin for Fireflies), or alternatively as the Medium Range Missile Fighter (MRMF), was conducted by MBB under the terms of a contract issued by the German Air Force.Hasik 2008, pp. 47-48. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the MRMF programme had been motivated by the concept that a future fighter could be both lighter and cheaper if it could be so superior at mid-range combat that it could completely eliminate the need to perform any close-range dogfighting-style combat. As such, MBB was required to develop an airframe which possessed a suitable configuration to achieve a forward-facing radar cross-section that would be between 20-30dB (in the X band frequencies) below that of what a conventional fighter would typically achieve. Similar to Lockheed's own approach adopted during its development of the Have Blue demonstrated and production F-117 Nighthawk, MBB's design team harnesses the dimensional principles of an airframe externally covered by polyhedral shapes for the Lampyridae. These shapes deliberately avoid both conventional right angles and curved surfaces, alternatively, lift was generated via a system of vortices produced by its sharp leading edges. This multi-faceted exterior formed the basis of the envisaged stealth fighter; according to claims by Dr Gerhard Lobert, a former project leader at MBB, the Lampyridae was highly likely to have possessed superior low-observability (in terms of radar visibility) characteristics than the competing F-117 Nighthawk, despite the latter's exterior featuring more than double the number of radar-scattering facets in comparison to MBB's design. Testing Having developed a suitable design for such an aircraft, development activity on the Lampyridae programme proceeded to the construction of a single three-quarter scale piloted model of the aircraft. This model was initially used for a series of wind tunnel tests. Commenced during 1985, these tests are known to have involved at least two models, a 1:3.5-scale low-speed model and a 1:20-scale transonic model. According to Lobert, the results produced by the wind tunnel tests demonstrated the Lampyridae's design to have possessed favourable high-quality aerodynamic properties, despite the initial disadvantages presented by the polyhedral airframe design. In parallel to the ongoing design work, the company also developed its own computational method for calculating an aircraft's radar cross-section. These in-house calculations have been known to have been used to compare the design of the Lampyridae with the information that was available on the American F-117 Nighthawk. Further evaluation of the aircraft's radar cross-section was performed using a full-scale model, totalling 16 meters in length. Following the completion of preparatory work using a flight simulator, it is known that the manned 3/4-scale model performed at least 15 individual 'flights' inside the German-Dutch wind tunnel at Emmeloord, Flevoland, the Netherlands, during 1987. In the course of these test, complete flight cycles were simulated within the tunnel's 9.5 m2 test section; the Lampyridae was recorded as having flown at speeds of up to 120 kt (220 km/h) and having performing various small-amplitude movements across all axes. Termination and aftermath The Lampyridae programme was conducted between 1981 and 1987. The reasoning behind the programme's unceremonious cancellation during 1987 is unknown, there having been no announcement on the subject made by either by MBB nor the government of West Germany at the time. Aircraft publication Aviation Week attributed alleged closed-room pressure tactics on the part of the United States, who had recently been made aware of the programme's existence and not wanting a competing stealth aircraft to their own efforts to come to fruition, as having played a key role in its termination.Seligman, Lara and James Drew. \\"F-35As Still Grounded At Luke AFB After Hypoxia Reports.\\" Aviation Week, 12 June 2017. During early 1995, aerospace company Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA), the successor to MBB, decided to release some details of the previously top-secret Lampyridae programme. Many of the specifics of the aircraft and the overall programme have remained concealed. While detailed information in regards to the Lampyridae's radar signature and its testing are considered to be classified information, however, it is known that the targets for the airframe's radar cross-section were considered to have been achieved. Since the Lampyridae's cancellation, the German Air Force has retained interest in eventually deploying aircraft that take advantage of low-observability characteristics. In particular, it is known that the envisaged successor to the Panavia Tornado fighter-bomber is to be a yet-to-be-developed stealth aircraft (New Generation Fighter), however, it would be very likely to be developed under a multinational programme, similar to the Tornado or the Eurofighter Typhoon multirole combat aircraft.Majumdar, Dave. \\"Revealed: New Stealth Bomber Plans From Germany.\\" The National Interest, 29 December 2015.\\"France and Germany Have High Hopes for New Fighter Jet.\\" Stratfor, 15 August 2017.  Follow-on  Using the results from the Lampyridae program, DASA decided to research on a more mature and practical stealth design called TDEFS (Technology Demonstrator for Enhancement and Future Systems).https://www.aviationsmilitaires.net/v2/base/view/Model/2367.html A small scale high speed wind tunnel model called FTT (Fliegender Technologie ‚Äì Tr√§ger, English Flying Technology Platform) and an unmanned version FTTU. The aircraft was to have combined the faceted stealth technology of the Lampyridae with newly developed radar absorbent materials, but also fly-by-wire and thrust vectoring from the X-31. Some of these technologies were originally intended to be included in an upgrade of the Eurofighter Typhoon. However, the simple faceted stealth technology it made use of started to become obsolete in the 1990s, supposedly contributing to the decision to terminate the program.https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1997/1997%20-%201652.pdf The EADS MAKO, a cancelled high-performance jet trainer/light attack aircraft used some of the faceted stealth technology developed in the programs.

Ludi were held in conjunction with, or sometimes as the major feature of, Roman religious festivals, and were also presented as part of the cult of state. The earliest ludi were horse races in the circus (ludi circenses).Not all chariot races were part of religious festivals. Animal exhibitions with mock hunts (venationes) and theatrical performances (ludi scaenici) also became part of the festivals.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 66. Days on which ludi were held were public holidays, and no business could be conducted‚Äî\\"remarkably,\\" it has been noted, \\"considering that in the Imperial era more than 135 days might be spent at these entertainments\\" during the year.Matthew Bunson, A Dictionary of the Roman Empire (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246. In the late Roman Republic, 57 days were spent at ludi on fixed dates, with many of the additional game days added by Augustus. Although their entertainment value may have overshadowed religious sentiment at any given moment, even in late antiquity the ludi were understood as part of the worship of the traditional gods, and the Church Fathers thus advised Christians not to participate in the festivities.Beard, Religions of Rome, p. 262. The singular form ludus, \\"game, sport\\" or \\"play\\" has several meanings in Latin.Ludus, for instance, may refer to child's play, erotic game-playing, an elementary school, and a training camp for gladiators: Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprint), pp. 1048‚Äì1049. The plural is used for \\"games\\" in a sense analogous to the Greek festivals of games, such as the Panhellenic Games.Helen Lovatt, Statius and Epic Games: Sport, Politics, and Poetics in the Thebaid (Cambridge University Press, 2005), pp. 5‚Äì6. The late-antique scholar Isidore of Seville, however, classifies the forms of ludus as gymnicus (\\"athletic\\"), circensis (\\"held in the circus,\\" mainly the chariot races), gladiatorius (\\"gladiatorial\\") and scaenicus (\\"theatrical\\").Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 18.16.3. The relation of gladiatorial games to the ludi is complex; see Gladiator. Politics and religion Terracotta plaque (1st century) depicting a venatio, or human- animal blood sport Originally, all ludi seem to have been votive offerings (ludi votivi), staged as the fulfillment of a vow to a deity whose favor had been sought and evidenced. In 366 BC, the Ludi Romani became the first games to be placed on the religious calendar as an annual event sponsored by the state as a whole.Alison Futrell, The Roman Games: A Sourcebook (Blackwell, 2006), p. 2. Games in the circus were preceded by a parade (pompa circensis) featuring the competitors, mounted youths of the Roman nobility, armed dancers, musicians, a satyr chorus, and images of the gods. As the product of military victory, ludi were often connected to triumphs. The first recorded venatio (staged beast hunt) was presented in 186 BC by M. Fulvius Nobilior as part of his ludi votivi, for which he paid with booty displayed at his triumph.Ida √ñstenberg, Staging the World: Spoils, Captives, and Representations in the Roman Triumphal Procession (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 169. As religious ceremonies, ludi were organized at first by various colleges of priests; during the Republic, they were later presented by consuls, but became most associated with the responsibilities of the aediles. Although public money was allocated for the staging of ludi, the presiding official increasingly came to augment the splendor of his games from personal funds as a form of public relations.Lovat, Statius and Epic Games, p. 10. The sponsor was able to advertise his wealth, while declaring that he intended to share it for public benefit. Although some men with an eye on the consulship skipped the office of aedile for the very reason that massive expenditures were expected, those with sufficient resources spent lavishly to cultivate the favor of the people. The religious festivals to which the ludi were attached also occasioned public banquets, and often public works such as the refurbishing or building of temples.Overview based on Sumi, Ceremony and Power (see below). For an example, see discussion of Clodius Pulcher's aedileship in W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), pp. 198‚Äì199 online. Octavian crowned as Augustus Following the assassination of Julius Caesar at the Ides of March in 44 BC, Marcus Brutus realized that a significant segment of the populus regarded him not as a liberator, but as the murderer of a beloved champion, and among other gestures of goodwill toward the people, he arranged to sponsor the Ludi Apollinares, held annually July 6‚Äì13. Caesar's heir Octavian at once upstaged him with Ludi Victoriae Caesaris, \\"games in honor of Caesar's victory,\\" which ran July 20‚Äì28 in conjunction with a festival to honor Venus Genetrix, Caesar's patron deity and divine matriarch of the Julian gens. It was during these ludi, which also served as funeral games, that the comet famously appeared to \\"announce\\" Caesar's newly divine status. Octavian recognized the value of the festivals in unifying the people, and as Augustus instituted new ludi within his program of religious reform; public spectacles and entertainments were thus subsumed by Imperial cult.Geoffrey S. Sumi, Ceremony and Power: Performing Politics in Rome between Republic and Empire (University of Michigan Press, 2005), p. 15. Brutus's Ludi Apollinares is discussed at length, pp. 143‚Äì150, followed by discussion of Octavian's counter-efforts. See also John T. Ramsey and A. Lewis Licht, The Comet of 44 B.C. and Caesar's Funeral Games (American Philological Association, 1997), and Ittai Gradel, Emperor worship and Roman religion (Oxford University Press, 2002). Ludi compitalicii The ludi compitalicii (\\"crossroads games\\") were entertainments staged by the neighborhoods or community associations of Rome (vici)The Latin word vicus may refer to either the neighborhood itself, or to the neighborhood association. For a modern equivalent, see Neighborhood association. in conjunction with the Compitalia, the new year festival held on movable dates between the Saturnalia and January 5In 67 BC, the Compitalia was held on December 31; in 60 and 58, on January 1; and in 50, January 2 (Cicero, Ad Atticum 2.3.4 and 7.7.3; In Pisonem 8). The calendar of Philocalus (4th century AD) and that of Polemius Silvius (5th century AD) place ludi compitales on January 3‚Äì5. in honor of the crossroads Lares. In the late Republic, performances were held at the main intersections of neighborhoods throughout the city on the same day.T.P. Wiseman, Catullus and His World: A Reappraisal (Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 46. During the civil wars of the 80s, these ludi gave rise to often unruly plebeian political expression by the neighborhood organizations. Freedmen played a leading role, and even slaves participated in the festivities. In 67 BC, the Compitalia had been disrupted by a riot at the ludi,Asconius 45C. which were also the scene of disturbances in 66‚Äì65 BC. This unrest on the first occasion was a response to the trial of Manilius, who had backed reforms pertaining to the voting rights of freedmen, and on the second is attached to the murky events later referred to misleadingly as the First Catilinarian Conspiracy.Andrew Lintott, Violence in Republican Rome (Oxford University Press, 1968), p. 80. Along with some forms of occupational guilds (collegia) and neighborhood associations, the ludi compitalicii were consequently banned by the senate in 64 BC.Nicholas Purcell, \\"The City of Rome and the plebs urbana in the late Republic,\\" The Cambridge Ancient History (Cambridge University Press, 1994, 2003, 2nd ed.) vol. 9, p. 674. For a discussion of the problematic relationship of the vici and the collegia, see W. Jeffrey Tatum, The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), p. 117. John Bert Lott, The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 177, makes a distinction between the Compitalia proper, which was a state holiday, and the localized celebrations that were \\"discouraged at times.\\" An unnamed tribune of the plebs supported efforts to stage the ludi for 61 BC, but the consul-designate Metellus Celer squelched the attempt.Cicero, In Pisonem 7.25‚Äì26; Tatum, Patrician Tribune p. 118. In 58 BC, Clodius Pulcher, who had given up his patrician status to become one of the people's tribunes, restored the right of association, but even before his law was enacted, his aide Sextus Cloelius had prepared the way by organizing new-year ludi. The consul Calpurnius Piso, father-in-law of Caesar, permitted the games, even though the organizations that ran them were still outlawed.Cynthia Damon, \\"Sex. Cloelius, Scriba,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 94 (1992), pp. 228 and 232. Caesar banned the collegia and ludi again in 46 BC. In 7 BC, Augustus reorganized Rome for administrative purposes into 265 districts which replaced but which were still called vici.Asconius 6‚Äì7; Suetonius, Divus Julius 42.3 and Augustus 30.2 and 31.4; William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), pp. 279‚Äì280. Costas Panayotakis, Decimus Laberius: The Fragments (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 208, is not convinced that ludi scaenici, or theatrical performances, were part of the crossroads events. An image of the Genius of Augustus now stood between the Lares at the crossroads shrines, and the ludi once considered dangerously subversive became expressions of Imperial piety.Anthony James Boyle, An Introduction to Roman Tragedy (Routledge, 2006), p. 174. Ludi circenses Ludi circenses were games presented in the circus. The Circus Maximus was primarily a venue for chariot races, but other athletic events, races, and beast hunts might be offered as well.Lawrence Richardson, of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 82. The games were preceded by an opening parade, the pompa circensis. Ludi circenses were regularly featured in celebrating a triumph or dedicating a major building. They were part of the most important holidays and festivals, such as the Floralia, Ludi Romani (\\"Roman Games\\"), and Ludi Plebeii (\\"Plebeian Games\\").Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary, pp. 82, 87; Michele Renee Salzman, On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity (University of California Press, 1990), p. 120. During the Imperial era, circus games were often added to festivals for which they were not traditionally celebrated in the Republic.Salzman, On Roman Time, p. 126 et passim. Circus games were held in various provinces throughout the empire, as indicated by archaeological remains of tracks and supporting structures, although many areas would have lacked costly permanent facilities and instead erected temporary stands around suitable grounds.Duncan Fishwick, The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire (Brill, 2004), vol. 3, pp. 337‚Äì343; A.T.

He was one of 33 men rescued by the McCann Rescue Chamber when the submarine sank in 240 feet of water during routine sea trials in the Atlantic Ocean off Portsmouth, New Hampshire on May 23, 1939, and was rescued in a two-day rescue operation. USS Squalus disaster Twenty-six men (one officer, Ensign Joseph H. Patterson; 23 enlisted men; and two civilian technicians, Donald M. Smith and Charles M. Wood) were trapped in a flooded aft compartment and died. The remaining 32 naval personnel and a third civilian, naval architect Harold C. Preble, spent up to 39 hours in the sunken vessel before they were brought to the surface by the McCann Rescue Chamber which was used for the first time. Survivors of the USS Squalus were brought up in four trips as the diving bell rode a cable attached to the forward escape hatch of the submarine. A naval board of inquiry concluded that ‚Äúa mechanical failure in the operating gear of the engine induction valve,‚Äù had caused flooding of the aft compartment. The USS Squalus was later salvaged, repaired and returned to sea as the renamed , receiving credit for sinking seven enemy vessels in World War II. World War II Naquin also was a survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor while aboard the battleship , which sank in shallow water after being struck a bomb and two torpedoes in the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. During World War II, he served as navigator of the heavy cruiser in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. At the Battle of Tassafaronga on November 30, 1942 the cruiser was struck by a Japanese torpedo, which detonated the ship's forward magazines and gasoline tanks and the ensuing explosion severed 150 ft of her bow forward of turret #2. The severed bow, including turret #1, swung around the port side and crushed several holes in the New Orleans' hull before it sank at the stern and damaged the port inboard propeller. Naquin guided the ship to Tulagi Harbor, which was reached near daybreak on December 1, 1942 for repairs and was awarded a Bronze Star for his role in saving the vessel. Naquin played two roles in the sinking of the . His first role as Port Director at Guam was to not inform Capt. Charles Butler McVay III of enemy submarine activity along the route from Guam to Leyte and to refuse a request for escort, making this the first time a cruiser had traveled the Philippine Sea unescorted. The trip was approximately 1,500 miles; when the USS Indianapolis sunk it was 300 miles from land. The second role Naquin played was to not follow through on being notified of a distress call from a ship in the approximate area where the USS Indianapolis would be, even once he was made aware that the USS Indianapolis was seriously overdue. His justification was that it was Navy policy to confirm a distress call and his Office sent out a reply message but did not get a return message. The reason for this policy was that the Navy wanted to be sure that the call was not an enemy trap. There were many high-ranking officers who had knowledge of the route and schedule of the USS Indianapolis voyage from Tinian to Guam to Leyte and were anticipating word of the ship's arrival in Leyte. There are many scenarios where, under proper Navy procedure the survivors could have been found at least approximately 24 hours before they were, and as soon as twenty-four hours after the sinking of the ship, which would have been forty-eight hours earlier. They were not found until a pilot on routine patrol spotted them by accident approximately seventy-one hours after the incident. It took another two days for everybody to be rescued. The crew consisted of 1,196 young men in their late teens and early twenties. Approximately 300 went down with the ship and 317 survived, with approximately 550‚Äì600 lost at sea. The twenty-four- or forty-eight-hour difference would have saved hundreds of lives, and, of course, if there had been an escort with submarine detection capability, perhaps, all could have been saved.

He ran in the preliminary heats, however a groin injury prevented him from running in the final race which was won by Robert Esmie, Glenroy Gilbert, Bruny Surin, and Donovan Bailey. He had a personal best of 10.19 in the 100 metres. Early career Chambers first started track when he entered grade nine at Malton's Ascension of our Lord Catholic Secondary School in September 1990. Born in June 1975, he was 15 years old as of Sept 1 of that year and competed as a junior, where most 15-year-olds compete in the younger midget boy category. With little coaching or training Chambers ran to a 10.84 and a silver medal in the 100m at the O.F.S.A.A. (Ontario Federation of Schools Athletic Association) in June of '91. The race finished with the first five junior boys within 0.02 seconds of each other. That year Mark Guthrie of the Brampton Track Club approached the 5'6\\" sprinter and suggested that he join the club. Chambers didn't show up to most of the practices until May of the following year - 1992. That year going into O.F.S.A.A., Chambers relied on his natural ability rather than his training preparation. He won the junior boys 100m in 10.99 and Guthrie knew he has a star on his hands. From then on Chambers trained more regularly and enjoyed quite a lot of success at O.T.F.A. (Ontario Track and Field Association) meets. At the beginning of the '93 high school track season Chambers was preparing himself with Guthrie for the first of three possible senior boys 100's, as he was only in grade 11 at this time. But the Catholic separate school board had a \\"work to rule\\" strike and as a result Chambers' school did not send athletes to O.F.S.A.A. The following indoor season Chambers trained intently and won a 60m Gold medal at the York University high school Track and Field invitational. Chambers ran a hand-timed 10.2 at the city track meet (ROPSSAA) and he went to the O.F.S.A.A. ranked #1 in the province. There the 100m record had once been set at 10.55 by Yorkdale S.S.'s Ben Johnson and was later broken by Sudbury LaSalle's Robert Esmie when he ran 10.50 in 1991. In the qualifying heat, Carlton ran to a legal, non wind-aided, time of 10.41 seconds. In the final, Eric Frempong of Martingrove C.I. ran a wind-aided 10.36 to win Bronze, and Dave Tomlin of Grand River ran 10.30 for Silver. Carlton Chambers then claimed the O.F.S.A.A. Gold with his 10.27w time. NCAA After his time in the O.F.S.A.A. Chambers signed on at Clemson University with a full track scholarship. The summer of 1994 saw Chambers win a Silver medal at the Canadian Juniors behind defending champion Frempong. This qualified him for the World Juniors in Portugal. There he ran a new Canadian Junior record, breaking Desai Williams' 16-year-old 10.32 with a 10.30, 5th-place finish. Chambers got his first international relay experience as the Canadian Junior 4 √ó 100 m team of Chambers, Frempong, Dave Tomlin and Chris Robinson won Bronze in 39.90. That same summer he was selected to run the third leg of the Commonwealth 4 √ó 100 m relay where he handed the baton off to Bruny Surin who ran it in for Gold. After two years at Clemson, Carlton went to the 1996 NCAA championships and ran to a fourth place in the 100m with a time of 10.19. Ato Boldon of UCLA won the race and later went to the 1996 Olympic Games and ran a 9.90 100m in Atlanta to win bronze. 1996 Olympics In Atlanta, Chambers ran the heats in the 4 √ó 100 m relay. In the final Chambers was replaced by Robert Esmie, who lead off the relay. Canada won the gold medal in 37.69 seconds, defeating the United States and establishing a national record in the event. Chambers had suffered a groin injury running the 200m, and the switch with Esmie was made.Sprinter gets his place in history In 2008, Carlton Chambers, along with his 4 √ó 100 m relay teammates from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics were inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.

A best- selling novelist in both the United States and Europe, his books have been translated into more than a dozen languages. He is best known for Secret Agenda, perhaps the first investigative work to question the orthodox narrative of the Watergate scandal as propounded by The Washington Post.Secret Agenda: Watergate, Deep Throat and the CIA, Random House, New York, 1984.\\"A New Explanation of Watergate,\\" by J. Anthony Lukas, The New York Times, 11/11/84. Born James Richard Edwards in Brooklyn, N.Y., he graduated from William Horlick High School in Racine, Wisconsin (1960). In 1966, he earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Soon afterwards, he wed Carolyn A. Johnson and began work as a newspaper reporter and photographer for the Prince George's Sentinel in suburban Maryland. After winning awards from the Maryland-Delaware Press Association, he joined the Capitol Times newspaper in Madison, Wisconsin. In 1971, while working at the Cap Times and as a stringer for The New York Times, he was named an Alicia Patterson and Rockefeller Foundation fellow. Reporting from Mexico City, Amsterdam, Ibiza, Athens, and London, his articles for the two foundations about \\"contemporary Western youth movements\\" were published in an array of national newspapers and magazines.Alicia Patterson Foundation\\"President's Ten- Year Review & Annual Report 1971 The Rockefeller Foundation\\" Rockefellerfoundation.org During this time, while covering counter-cultural movements in the West, he reported as well on the massacre of student dissidents in Mexico City's Tlatelolco Square and on the violent repression of their Greek counterparts by the military junta in Athens.\\"Hard Times at the Athens News,\\" Harper's Magazine, April, 1974. Both assignments were considered dangerous. Hougan is also an award-winning investigative journalist and broadcaster. He lives in Afton, Virginia. Works Hougan's first book, Decadence, was published soon after his return from Europe.Decadence: Radical Nostalgia, Narcissism and Decline, William Morrow, New York, 1975. His second book, Spooks, reported on the \\"metastasis\\" of the American intelligence community and the emerging \\"cryptocracy.\\"Spooks: the Haunting of America ‚Äì the Private Use of Secret Agents, William Morrow, New York, 1978. In its review, the Los Angeles Times declared Spooks \\"one of the best non-fiction books of the year, a monument of fourth-level research and fact-searching.\\" Howard Hughes, Robert Maheu, Robert Vesco, Aristotle Onassis, and Yoshio Kodama were among the book's more infamous subjects, but its most important contribution to the investigative canon may have been its reportage about lesser known intelligence agents such as Bernard Spindel, Lou Russell, Mitch WerBell, John Frank, Joseph Shimon and others.Spooks, index. Aa Washington Editor of Harper's Magazine (1979‚Äì84), Hougan wrote extensively about the U.S. intelligence community, and the CIA in particular. His investigation of the Watergate break-in uncovered links between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in the Watergate office building and a call-girl ring at a nearby apartment complex. This liaison arrangement, coupled with evidence implicating the CIA in the operation, led to the publication of Secret Agenda: Watergate, Deep Throat and the CIA.Random House, New York, 1984 A Book of the Month Club selection, Secret Agenda was chosen by the New York Times as \\"one of the year's most noteworthy books.\\" Throughout this period, Hougan made numerous radio and television appearances on such programs as NPR's All Things Considered, The Today Show, Good Morning America, and programs hosted by Larry King, Tom Snyder, and Regis Philbin. In the mid-1980s, Hougan joined author Sally Denton in forming a Washington-based company ‚Äì Hougan & Denton ‚Äì which undertook investigative research for law firms and labor unions. Clients included the AFL-CIO, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the United Mine Workers of America, and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). During this same period, Hougan joined with Norman Mailer and Edward Jay Epstein in forming what Hougan characterized as \\"an invisible salon,\\" but which The New York Times called \\"a small coterie of intelligence buffs, conspiracy theorists and meta-political speculators, who, with all proper self-mockery, call themselves 'the Dynamite Club.'\\" The group met irregularly at the Manhattan apartment of Edward Jay Epstein and at the Washington manse of Bernard \\"Bud\\" Fensterwald (founder of the Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington, D.C.). Attendees included Dick Russell (author of The Man Who Knew Too Much), Don DeLillo (Libra and Underworld), Kevin Coogan (Dreamer of the Day), G. Gordon Liddy (Will) and others. At the time, Hougan was helping Mailer in his research for what became Mailer's CIA novel, Harlot's Ghost. And while Mailer referred to these informal gatherings ‚Äì drinks and dinner ‚Äì as \\"meetings,\\" the affairs had more in common with those of a salon than of an actual \\"club.\\"\\"The Old Man and the Novel\\" by Scott Spencer, The New York Times, Sept. 22, 1991 In early 1991, Hougan was retained as a private investigator by AFL-CIO's Industrial Union Department (IUD) and by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA). At stake were the jobs of more than 1,700 workers at the Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation (RAC) in Ravenswood, West Virginia ‚Äì a demographic that constituted the majority of the town's workforce. Hougan discovered that the plant from which the workers had been locked-out was secretly controlled by Marc Rich, a fugitive billionaire and commodities broker then resident in Zug, Switzerland. For the next two years, Hougan led the investigative component of an international campaign marked by demonstrations in Switzerland and England, and by congressional hearings in Washington and parliamentary speeches in Bern. In the summer of 1992, Rich finally capitulated and the Steelworkers returned to their jobs. The Ravenswood campaign has since been called \\"one of the most innovative and sophisticated contract campaigns ever waged by an American union. What happened in this small West Virginia town serves as a beacon of hope for American workers...\\"Ravenswood: The Steelworkers' Victory and the Revival of American Labor, by Tom Juravich & Kate Bronfenbrenner, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, N.Y., 1999. With the successful closure of the Ravenswood campaign, Hougan returned to investigative reporting, documentaries and books. In 1993, he became one of the first ‚Äì if not the first ‚Äì American journalist to return to Beirut after years of internecine warfare, kidnappings and bombings. On assignment for the television documentary program, 60 Minutes, Hougan and Lowell Bergman paved the way for Mike Wallace to interview three of Hezbollah's most powerful figures: its spiritual leader, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah; its former Secretary- General, Sheik Subhi al-Tufayli; and Hussein Mussawi, an Iranian agent and head of Islamic Amal. Both Musawi and Tufayli have been implicated in Lebanon's torturous Hostage Crisis. The segment - \\"Three Days in Beirut\\" - aired in 1994.Paleycenter.org Hougan continued to work for 60 Minutes over the next two years, after which he returned to writing books. These were thrillers, all but one written with his wife, the novelist Carolyn Hougan, using the pseudonym, \\"John Case.\\"Random House The first of these of was The Genesis Code, a New York Times best-seller.Ballantine Books, New York, 1997 The First Horseman followed a year later.Ballantine Books, New York, 1998.

The language is notable for its retroflex consonants (Aklilu Yilma 1988), a striking feature shared with closely related Dizi, Sheko and nearby (but not closely related) Bench. The language has 5 vowels that can be long or short. The question of the status of a short mid central vowel is still unresolved. There are three phonemic tones and syllabic nasal consonants. There are ejective stops and affricates, but no implosives (Aklilu 2002:6,7).

She had been built as SS West Apaum for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as part of the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States. West Apaum sailed on three voyages for the US Navy, two after the Armistice, before she was decommissioned in July 1919. Though little is available regarding West Apaums civilian career, it is known that she was sailing on a New York ‚Äì Rotterdam route in early 1927. By early 1929, West Apaum had been laid up by the USSB, which abandoned her in 1933. The cargo ship was scrapped in the second quarter of that same year.  Design and construction  The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West, like West Apaum,Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358‚Äì59. one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle, Washington.Skinner & Eddy was an emergency shipyard that only operated from 1916 until about 1920. West Apaum (Skinner & Eddy No. 23, USSB No. 88) was laid down on 19 March 1918, launched on 23 May, and delivered to the Navy upon completion on 19 June. West Apaum was built in a total of 78 working days, 92 calendar days,Hurley, pp. 92‚Äì93. and was tied with three other ships for tenth place on a list of the ten fastest constructed ocean-going vessels compiled in 1920.The other three ships tied for tenth-fastest were and ‚Äîboth also constructed by Skinner & Eddy, and Lake Gardner. See: Hurley, p. 93. Skinner & Eddy received a $25,000 bonus for completing the ship early.United States House of Representatives, Select Committee on U. S. Shipping Board Operations, p. 624. The ship was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. West Apaum had a steel hull and a mean draft of . She displaced 12,226 t, and had a deadweight tonnage of . The ship had a single triple-expansion steam engine powered by three coal-fired boilers that drove her single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a pace.  Military career  USS West Apaum (ID-3221) was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) on 20 June 1918 with Lieutenant Commander J. S. Gibson, USNRF, in command. West Apaum departed Bremerton, Washington, on 27 June for Arica, Chile, to take on a cargo of nitrates for the United States. Sailing from there via the Panama Canal, West Apaum arrived at Savannah, Georgia, on 9 September. From there she sailed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived on 10 October. Eight days later, loaded with rolling stock, steel rails, and other general cargo for the United States Army, the cargo ship sailed for France. Delayed at Halifax for repairs to her damaged propeller, West Apaum finally entered the harbor at La Pallice on 22 November, 11 days after the Armistice. West Apaum unloaded her railroad goods, loaded of Army cargo, and headed for the United States on 13 December. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 3 January 1919. West Apaum made two more voyages to France under Navy control. On her final voyage, she carried airplane materials to France and returned of Army ordnance to New York on 11 July. On 25 July, West Apaum was decommissioned and returned to the USSB.  Civilian career  Little is known about West Apaums subsequent civilian career. In the first quarter of 1927, it is known that West Apaum was sailing on a New York ‚Äì Rotterdam route. While in this service, The New York Times, in one of just a few mentions the ship received in contemporary news coverage, reported on the transfer of one of West Apaums crew members to the United States Lines ocean liner at sea. The crewman had fallen into an open hatchway and had fractured his skull. The two ships, located some west of New York, came within of each other and the injured man was loaded onto a boat from Republic in the heavy seas. The crewman, though successfully transferred to Republic, died several hours later. By early 1929, West Apaum had been laid up, and was under consideration by the USSB for the installation of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes, but lost out on the honor to . No further information on West Apaums career is available, but it is known that she was abandoned by the USSB in 1933, and scrapped in the second quarter of that year.

They regulate the gene expression at transcription level. Alarmones are produced in high concentrations when harsh environmental factors occur in bacteria and plants, such as lack of amino acids, to produce proteins. Stringent factors take uncharged tRNA and convert it to an alarmone. Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) is then converted to 5¬¥-diphosphate 3¬¥-diphosphate guanosine (ppGpp), the archetypical alarmone. ppGpp will bind to RNA polymerase Œ≤ and Œ≤¬¥ subunits, changing promoter preference.

Friederike became the Duchess of Anhalt-Bernburg upon her marriage to Alexander Karl, Duke of Anhalt- Bernburg, the last Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg. She served as Regent of the Duchy from 1855 to 1863. Early life Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, from 1825 Duke of Gl√ºcksburg. Friederike was born on 9 October 1811 at Gottorp Castle near Schleswig in the Duchy of Schleswig as Princess Friederike of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, the second- eldest daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Beck, and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel. Friederike's father was the head of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, a junior male branch of the House of Oldenburg which had occupied the throne of Denmark since 1448. Through her father, Friederike was thus a direct male-line descendant of King Christian III of Denmark. Friederike's mother was a daughter of Landgrave Charles of Hesse, a Danish Field Marshal and Royal Governor of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and his wife Princess Louise of Denmark, a daughter of Frederick V of Denmark. On 6 June 1825, Duke Friedrich Wilhelm was appointed Duke of Gl√ºcksburg by his brother-in-law Frederick VI of Denmark, as the elder Gl√ºcksburg line had become extinct in 1779. He subsequently changed his title to Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg and founded the younger Gl√ºcksburg line. Duchess of Anhalt-Bernburg Friederike's husband, Alexander Charles, Duke of Anhalt- Bernburg.Friederike married Alexander Karl, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg, son of Alexis Friedrich Christian, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg and Princess Marie Friederike of Hesse-Kassel, on 30 October 1834 at Schloss Louisenlund, near Schleswig. The union was childless. By November 1855 the Duke was confined to Schloss Hoym due to a progressive mental illness (some sources state that he suffered from schizophrenia). There, Alexander Karl spend the rest of his life under medical care in the company of his chamberlain, the painter Wilhelm von K√ºgelgen. Due to his incapacity, Friederike acted as regent. Later life Alexander Karl died at Hoym on 19 August 1863 at age 58. Because the marriage produced no issue, the Duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg was inherited by his kinsman Leopold IV, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau-K√∂then who merged the duchy with his own to form a united Duchy of Anhalt.

Simultaneously, he has continued to interpret the classical and romantic repertoire as well as many surprising and varied pieces from the 20th and 21st centuries. Different productions have since enabled Spinosi to enjoy musical friendships with artists such as Cecilia Bartoli, Marie-Nicole Lemieux and Philippe Jaroussky, with whom he recorded the album Heroes for EMI-Virgin Classics, a disc whose sales achieved triple-gold status. From 2007, Spinosi conducted every season new opera productions with the Ensemble Matheus at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet and he still regularly performs at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es, the Theater an der Wien or the Wiener Staatsoper. For several years he has worked with stage-directors including Pierrick Sorin (for Rossini's La Pietra del Paragone in 2007 and 2014), Oleg Kulik (for Monteverdi's Vespers for the Blessed Virgin in 2009), or again Claus Guth (for Handel's Messiah at the Theater an der Wien, 2009), Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser (for Rossini‚Äôs Otello at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-Elys√©es and Salzburg Festival in 2014). Spinosi has worked regularly with numerous orchestras including the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestra of Wiener Staatsoper, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo, the hr-Sinfonieorchester Frankfurt, the Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, the Rundfunk- Sinfonieorchester Berlin, the Wiener Symphoniker, the ORF Radio Symphonieorchester Wien, the Orquesta de Castilla y Leon, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the NDR Radiophilharmonie Hannover, the Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg, the Orchestre du Festival de Verbier, the Handel and Haydn Society from Boston, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Osaka Philharmonic Orchestra, the Konzerthausorchester Berlin, the Orchestra of Staatsoper Hamburg. Spinosi and Cecilia Bartoli continued their close collaboration with two more Rossini operas, Otello at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs- Elys√©es and at the Salzburg Festival and La Cenerentola at the Salzburg Festival. His last two recordings for Deutsche Grammophon ‚Äì Miroirs with the Ensemble Matheus and Lucifer with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo ‚Äì received the ‚ÄúChoc‚Äù distinction from Classica magazine.

It is the sequel to Space Battleship Yamato and an adaptation of the movie Arrivederci Yamato created by Yoshinobu Nishizaki and Leiji Matsumoto. It aired on Yomiuri TV in Japan from October 14, 1978 to April 4, 1979. It later got a remake in 2017 under the name Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2202. Overview As the popularity of the Space Battleship Yamato franchise became clear (largely because of the outcry from fans who saw the movie), a second season of the television series was produced, retconning the movie to present a different plot in which the Yamato and its primary characters were not killed off. Expanding the story to 26 episodes, the second season featured additional plot lines, such as a love story between Teresa (Trelaina) and Yamato crew member Daisuke Shima (Mark Venture), and an antagonism between Kodai and Saito (Knox), leader of a group of space marines. This season is considered the best by many fans on account of the strategic space fleet battles, the imaginative spaceship designs created by Studio Nue, and the character development of Gamilas leader Desler. Footage from Arrivederci Yamato was reused in the second season, particularly in the opening titles; the sequence of the Yamato launching from water was also reused in two of the subsequent movies. Plot The Year is 2201, 2 years after the defeat of the Gamillas Empire and the restoration of Earth, the planet is entering a new age of Militarization with the completion of the new Intergalactic Ship, the Andromeda. However, the Gatlantis Empire (White Comet Empire), a new and even greater threat than the Gamilas, attacks Earth after crew of the Yamato investigates an SOS signal from the mysterious Teresa of planet Telezart. At the same time Desler, leader of the Gamilas Empire, also seeks revenge for his defeat at the hands of the Yamato.

He was the eldest son of And≈ç Nobuyori and his mother was a daughter of Matsudaira Nobuakira of Yoshida Domain. His childhood names were Kinnoshin and Kinnosuke and he was known most of his life as And≈ç Nobuyuki, taking the name of Nobumasa only after he became a r≈çj≈´. Biography Nobumasa was born at the domain's Edo residence, and was received in formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienari in 1835. He became daimy≈ç in 1847 on the death of his father. In 1848, he was promoted to the post of s≈çshaban within the shogunal administration. In 1858, he rose to the post of jisha-bugy≈ç, and subsequently was appointed a wakadoshiyori under the Tair≈ç Ii Naosuke. In 1860 he was appointed a r≈çj≈´, and placed in charge of foreign affairs. Ii Naosuke was assassinated in the Sakuradamon Incident in 1860 and And≈ç Nobumasa became a leading councilor of state together with Kuze Hirochika.Harootunian, Toward Restoration, p. 276. Among the many problems he faced in foreign affairs during this Bakumatsu period, was them the conclusion of a commercial treaty with Prussia, the assassination of Henry Heusken, and the appearance of a Russian warship claiming Tsushima Island for the Russian Empire. And≈ç was also a supporter of the kobu-gattai policy to strengthen relations between the imperial court and the shogunate. He was instrumental in arranging for Kazunomiya, the younger sister of Emperor K≈çmei, to marry Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemochi. All of these actions aroused the enmity of pro-Sonn≈ç j≈çi samurai, and And≈ç himself was the target of an assassination attempt in 1862 by six former Mito Domain samurai outside the Sakashita Gate of Edo Castle.also called Sakashita Gate Incident. British counsul-general Rutherford Alcock remarked on meeting the heavily-bandaged And≈ç shortly afterwards and was favourably impressed with his fortitude, stating that his injuries lent credence to claims by the shogunate that the opening of the country to foreign trade had to proceed slowly due to strong domestic opposition. However, And≈ç was forced from office soon afterwards by his political enemies, who accused him of improper conduct in arranging for an heir to succeed Ii Naosuke and due to non-founded allegations that he had accepted bribes from American consul Townsend Harris. The kokudaka of Iwakitaira Domain was also reduced by 20,000 koku. He officially retired in 1863; however as his son and heir And≈ç Nobutami was still underage, he continued to rule the domain from behind-the-scenes. And≈ç Nobutami died in 1863 and was replaced by an adopted heir, And≈ç Nobutake. In 1868, during the Boshin War, Nobumasa took the domain into the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei over the objections of Nobutake. The domain was overrun and Iwakitaira Castle was burned during the Battle of Iwakitaira, and the victorious Meiji government placed Nobumasa under permanent house arrest in 1868. He was released in 1869 and died in 1871.He was 52 years old.  References  *Papinot, Edmond. (1948). Historical and Geographical Dictionary of Japan. New York: Overbeck Co. * Harootunian, Harry D.

General information Problem No girl who has completed her secondary education in the Muhuru Bay school district has ever qualified for college entrance, while a significant number of boys qualify every year. The Muhuru Bay region of Nyanza has some of the highest HIV and malaria infection rates in the country, as well as extreme poverty. Due to its isolation, Nyanza has not participated in the economic development that has occurred in other regions of Kenya. The area remains without electricity, potable water, and governmental commitment to development. As is common around the world, girls suffer the most in impoverished communities. Of the girls who enter secondary school, many engage in transactional sex with their male teachers, the fishermen from Lake Victoria or other men, leading to early pregnancies, HIV infection, and high dropout rates. There is an undeniable need to provide safe and effective education to the girls of Muhuru Bay to break the cycle of early marriage, HIV, and poverty. Mission The Women‚Äôs Institute for Secondary Education and Research (WISER), a Kenyan NGO in partnership with Duke University, is a model for girls‚Äô education and community development in post-conflict, rural Kenya. We established the first girls‚Äô secondary boarding school and community center dedicated to expanding the social and economic capital of women in the southern Lake Victoria region. WISER focuses on academic excellence and fostering an entrepreneurial spirit of inquiry and intellectual independence, as well as providing programs to build leadership capacity in community health, technology and economic development. WISER provides the first potable water, wind and solar power, and computer technology in the region. WISER also works with community members who desire adult education, and provide special programs to young men who wish to become gender allies. History Relationship with Egerton University For the last five years, Duke University has been developing and deepening its relationship with Egerton University in Kenya. The relationship is a collaboration between Dr. Sherryl Broverman, Associate Professor of the Practice in Biology at Duke and Dr. Rose Odhiambo at Egerton University. Dr. Broverman initially consulted with the Institute for Women, Gender and Development Studies (IWGDS), which Dr. Odhiambo directs, on the development and assessment of a course on HIV/AIDS for a general audience. Egerton is one of the few universities in Kenya that mandates a course on HIV/AIDS for all undergraduates, and has been a national leader in infusing gender issues into the dialog about HIV/AIDS. Duke students in Kenya For five years, Dr. Broverman has traveled to Kenya with students to do a needs assessment of WISER's Kenyan peers and develop a community-based research project for students at Duke. In subsequent years, Duke students have worked with Egerton students to develop an HIV/AIDS peer education manual; a manual on the interaction between gender, health, and development; and a documentary of Kenyans living openly and 'positively' with AIDS. Egerton graduates who have participated in its HIV/AIDS education and training programs are now being selectively recruited by the Ministry of Education. In 2005 the National Science Foundation awarded a grant to Dr. Broverman to develop an international collaborative learning program that linked students at Duke and Egerton throughout the semester via an email dialog and joint homework assignments. Duke University also provided funds to install a satellite system for enhanced Internet connection at the IWGDS. Dr. Broverman's award from the Division of Undergraduate Education at NSF is the first international education program funded by that agency. The NSF has recently made the development of research and education programs‚Äîsuch as the one between Duke and Egerton‚Äîa high priority that increase the ability of future leaders to work in a global society. Introduction to Muhuru Bay Dr. Odhiambo was the first girl from the Muhuru District to ever go to college, and in the 25 years since she left the school district no other girl has gone on to university. In contrast, male students from Muhuru routinely graduate with good grades and matriculate to college. Throughout their visits to Muhuru Bay, Drs. Odhiambo and Broverman always met with girls at Rabwao Secondary School, the only mixed gender secondary school in the district, to support girls' education. During the summer of 2005, Mr. Richard Okinyi, the headmaster of Rabwao, asked Dr. Broverman to develop a project that would both determine the causes of the gender gap in academic performance at Rabwao and develop interventions that could be implemented. Mr. Okinyi and other local education officials also raised the need for a 'girls only' boarding school in the area that could provide a better educational environment. Boarding schools are the norm for secondary school in Kenya; the ones for girls routinely produce higher achieving students than mixed schools. The Birth of WISER In the summer of 2006, Dr. Broverman and a team of seven undergraduate students lived for one month on the Rabwao Secondary School campus to research obstacles to girls' educational success. Interviews and focus groups were held with all 250 students, all teachers and administrators, local primary school teachers from the nine local schools, parents, the area chiefs, representatives from the Ministry of Education, and Provincial government officials. At the same time, town hall meetings were held in three languages in order to determine the needs of the community. It became clear that the citizens of Muhuru Bay believed that a private boarding school for girls would be an essential step towards improving the educational performance of local girls and their opportunities in the future. To reflect the strong community support and commitment to the WISER project, the Chief of Muhuru Bay donated of land to be used as the site for the school. WISER is currently working with an eight person in-country advisory team to open WISER in Muhuru Bay within the next few years. Signature Programs WISER's Core Co-Curriculum WISER will utilize a holistic approach to developing tomorrow's female leaders. Coupled with academic rigor, WISER scholars will also be given the opportunity to learn three professional skills in community health work, Chinese language, or computer literacy to be prepared for multiple post-graduation plans. Co- Founder Andy Cunningham in Kenya Green Community Resources WISER will be a green school and bring the first source of potable drinking water to the area by a solar pump. WISER will also create the first solarpowered campus and computer lab in the region while providing community members and students with new green collar job opportunities. CampWISER & WISERBridge CampWISER will provide health, gender, computer, and leadership summer programming led by Duke students for boys and girls in the Muhuru Bay community. The WISERBridge program will establish a yearlong academic enrichment program for the nine primary schools to improve high school exam scores and the quality of WISER feeder schools. WISER Partner Schools WISER has partnered with high schools and middle schools across the USA who have committed to raising funds for one girl's scholarship for four years. The model is simple: students are empowering students through a global issue with a personal connection.

Mahatma Gandhi chose him to be his principal advisor in his campaign against untouchability. Joshi was equally a pragmatist, endorsing Nehru's investments in higher education and heavy industry.  Early life and family  Lakshman Shastri was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family in 1901 to Balaji and Chandrabhaga Joshi, in the village of Pimpalner, tahsil sakri,Dhule district in the present-day state of Maharashtra. He left home at age 14 after studying to be a priest. He finally settled in Wai, a historic temple town on the banks of the Krishna river. In Wai, he studied Sanskrit, Hindu dharma and Indian philosophy at the Pradnya pathshala, a renowned Vedic school. Later in 1923 he earned the degree \\"Tarkateertha\\", or literally, \\"Master of logic\\" at the Government Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya of Calcutta. In 1927, he married Satyawati Mulherkar. They had two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, Madhukar had a distinguished career at IBM in research and management. Career Joshi spent all his life in Wai. He was closely associated with Pradnya pathshala all his life. Although a Brahmin, he spent his life going against tradition. In 1932, at the age of 29, he was jailed by the British for his role in the freedom movement. However while in prison, he quickly gained a reputation as a Hindu dharma scholar. Under the tutelage of Vinobha Bhave, he learned English when Vinoba- Ji came to Wai to study under Kewalananda Saraswati. It was during one of those internments that Mahatma Gandhi, troubled by respectable Brahmin priests shying away from officiating at the intercaste marriage of his son Devdas, a Vania, or merchant class boy, to Lakshmi, the daughter of C. Rajagopalachari, a Brahmin, and later the second Governor General of independent India approached the young Joshi for his opinion on whether such a marriage was against Hindu dharma. With his thorough knowledge of the Shastras, Joshi not only judged the marriage acceptable but also performed the wedding ceremony.Marathi Vishwakosha, Vol.14, p. 698, 1989, ed. L.S.JoshiBombay Chronicle, June 1933; see also \\"Tarkateertha- Ek Pradnyapravaha\\", a biography in Marathi, SriVidya Prakashan, 1995 In the 1930s, Joshi came under the influence of radical humanist M. N. Roy* and quickly assimilated and embraced western philosophical systems. He questioned whether those that had the knowledge had the wisdom to lead, and recognized those that followed had inadequate knowledge. He was the member of Roy's Radical Democratic party until its dissolution 1948. He wrote a Marathi treatise called Vaidik Sankriti-cha Vikas (Development of Vedic Civilization) in 1951. This treatise was based on six lectures he delivered at the University of Pune, where he traced the evolution of \\"Vedic\\" culture and its influence on modern India. He wrote a critique arguing that modern Indians became conflicted between meeting material needs and attaining spiritual enlightenment, thus fostering a collective weakness, disharmony and allowing caste differences to prevail.See a recent English translation of this book, \\"Development of Indian Culture ‚ÄìVedas to Gandhi\\", Published by Lokvangmaya Griha, 2001; and In 1954, he presided over Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, which was held in New Delhi. In 1955, he received a Sahitya Akademi Award for his work Waidik Sanskruticha Wikas (‡§µ‡•à‡§¶‡§ø‡§ï ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡•Ä‡§ö‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∏).Sahitya Akademi awards in Marathi Official Site for Sahitya Akademi Award He served as the first president of Maharashtra State Board of Literature and Culture when it was established in 1960, and starting from that year, served for a large number of years as the president of the project of compiling Vishwakosh, a 20-volume Marathi encyclopedia under the sponsorship of the above Board. He also spearheaded compilation of Dharmakosha, a Marathi transliteration of the ancient Vedic/Hindu Sanskritic hymns. In Wai, he also opened a hostel for students of the Dalit castes, a factory for making hand-made paper and a printing press.  Literature  His first book, Shuddhisarvasvam, is a treatise in Sanskrit on the philosophical basis of religious conversion, published in 1934. In that same year, he edited the Dharmakosha, which encompassed twenty-six volumes and 18,000 pages, encoding the basic texts and commentaries on the varied aspects of dharma and dharma-shastras from 1500 BC to the 18th century. In 1938, he wrote Anand- Mimamsa, a critical commentary on the theory or Ras and aesthetics in Marathi literature. Later in 1973, he wrote Adhunik Marathi Sahityachi Samiksha, a study of the tenets of modern Marathi literary criticism. He also wrote Hindu Dharmachi Samiksha, in 1940, critically examining the concepts and foundation of Hinduism, and Jadawad, in 1941, a survey of the history and development of materialism in Indian and Western philosophical traditions. He wrote Vaidik Sanskriticha Vikas in 1958 to much acclaim. Amongst other works are Upanishadanche Marathi Bhashantar, a translation of the 18 principal Upanishads into Marathi. Other works include: * Waidik Sanskruticha Wikas * Wichara-Shilpa * Samiksha Ani Rasa-Siddhant * Critique of Hinduism and other Religions * Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts  Recognition and death  For his outstanding contribution, he received the Sahitya Akademi award from India's National Academy of Letters in 1955. In 1973, he received the National Sanskrit Pandit Award, and in 1976, the government of India conferred on him the Padma Bhushan title, India's third highest honour, for excellence in Literature and Education. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature from Bombay University in 1975. In 1989, Joshi received a Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, the highest award for lifetime achievement given by the Akademi, which is India's National Academy of Letters. In 1992 he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian honor, in recognition of a lifetime of exceptional and distinguished service to India. He died at the age of 94, near the birth spring of the Krishna river.

They are not slugs but are a kind of sawfly of the family Tenthredinidae. The pear slug is an important pest that eats leaves of cherry, pear, and plum trees, leaving behind a skeleton of veins. The larvae cover themselves in green slime, making themselves unpalatable to predators. When the larvae are fully grown, they drop off the tree on the ground and pupate underground. The adult sawfly emerges from the pupal case and climbs from the soil to mate and lays eggs on the leaves of the host plant, completing the lifecycle. Other sources dispute the notion that the females climb the tree to lay their eggs, claiming instead that they fly to the tree. This is an important detail in regard to their control in horticultural circumstances where glues are used to control climbing pests.

Episode 4.1: A New Beginning Having ended her business relationship with Peter Hamm, Peter is replaced by Jason Otto (Otto Models) a more accommodating partner and divided up the models between them. Janice holds an open casting call, she hires several new models, including a deaf man named Martin Ritchie. Janice decides to open a \\"model house\\" and move several of her models in, allowing her to work with them intensively. Her business manager advises her that she can't afford both the house and her office, so she decides to close the office and re-open the agency in the house. She also decides to move in. Finding the master suite hideous, she calls on her friend, designer Christopher Ciccone, to redecorate it. His makeover includes installing spy cameras throughout the house wired into Janice's bedroom. Swimwear designer Nicolita Sainz is looking for one male and one female model to be the \\"face of Nicolita\\". She selects CC, Traci and new model Polina for photo tests and hires new model Chandler Maness for the male role. Janice summons the existing models to the house and they start choosing bedrooms and taking advantage of the amenities. Janice arrives with the new models in tow and the existing models learn to their consternation that the new models will be living at the house. Episode 4.2: Out With the Old...In With the New After trying to mollify the existing models over her selection of the new models, Janice begins \\"Model 101\\" with the new models. A review of the new models' bodies leads her to conclude that everyone needs work. She sets up Xian and Chandler to go running together, which pleases them because they are attracted to each other. She then adds Hazuki to the exercise team. Traci and Polina join Chandler at the Nicolita shoot, but CC arrives late. CC's tardiness puts the shoot about two hours behind, but she interviews that it was unavoidable. She got her period the morning of the shoot and after going home to change got stuck in traffic. Traci raises Janice's ire by bringing her acting agent to the shoot. Janice interviews about all of the problems she's had with Traci, then tells Traci that they need to talk. Despite being late, CC books the shoot and becomes the \\"Face of Nicolita\\". Janice recognizes that her existing models are still resentful over not being invited to live in the house so she throws a party for all of the models. At the party, Janice congratulates CC but warns her not to be late to another shoot. She takes each of the Nicolita girl finalists aside to speak privately. She advises Traci that she must choose between being a model and an actress and gives her two weeks to get into shape. She congratulates Polina on her confidence and tells CC that she is going to be pushing her hard. Janice invites Crystal Truehart and Maurice Townsell to move into the house, Crystal because Janice believes her to be a high fashion model and Maurice because she believes his macho attitude will help the \\"effeminate\\" male models become more masculine. Kehoe pulls her aside and asks her to live in the house because he is between places (no mention is made of his season 3 roommate, Grant). She expresses reservations about his behaviour. Meanwhile, Maurice and Polina find themselves attracted to each other. While Janice does a shoot for Orbit, Nathan runs a casting call for Kentucky Denim jeans. The client selects Christian, Kehoe, Dominic, Martin, and Chandler from among the men and Dominique and Polina to serve as \\"background\\". To break the ice between the models, Janice decrees that they will all dress in drag. Everyone participates except Chandler, who clashes with Kehoe over Chandler's refusal. Eventually, Chandler decides to slip into a bra and panties. Kehoe, jealous of the attention Chandler is getting, tries to move in on Xian. Kehoe and Chandler each interview how annoying each finds the other. Episode 4.3: A Menace In the House Janice invites Traci to move into the house so she can monitor her weight. Traci, noting the number of jobs she has booked, considers Janice's concerns about her weight to be a joke. At the Kentucky Denim shoot, Martin is initially apprehensive that his hearing impairment will cause difficulties. The client, however, is very happy with his performance. Janice invites cosmetic dentist Bill Dorfman to the house to examine the models' smiles. Polina is especially excited at the thought of having her teeth fixed. Following the exams, Janice is surprised with a special dinner prepared by Xian. After dinner, Janice has Hazuki cut her long hair short. Several of the models interview that Kehoe is disruptive. The final straw comes when he makes a joke about using cocaine that Janice overhears. Janice ejects him from the house. Episode 4.4: Men in Tights Kehoe is ejected from the house, and worries he may have to sleep in his car. J. P. (with whom he joined the agency) asks him where the Kehoe he used to know has gone. He tells him if he wants to continue being a model with the agency he needs to find the old Kehoe. Janice wakes the models up early the next morning to exercise before a client, Tinte Cosmetics, arrives for a casting. While talking to Maurice, she finds empty carrot cake boxes and throat spray under Polina's bed. Worried that she could be developing an eating disorder she has a chat with Polina who says she can eat what she likes and never puts on weight and that she has a bad throat due to smoking. Still worried, but trusting Polina, Janice lets it go but tells her that she is always there if she needs to talk. The Tinte Cosmetics representatives arrive and ask to see the girls with no makeup, then set them a makeup challenge, Xian, Crystal and Dominique are chosen for the campaign, however Dominique is double booked. Janice fires her from the agency, then re-hires her after she apologizes for not letting Janice know the situation. Nadia replaces Dominique for the Tinte job. Janice wants the male models to work on their movement so she orders them into dance belts and tights for a ballet lesson. Martin is initially frustrated because he can't read the instructor's lips from his position, but soon moves to the front and has greater success. J. P. is deemed the best dancer and Payton the worst. Janice moves them, along with Danny, into the house. Payton clashes with Gabe and Janice, overhearing part of the exchange, orders Payton out. She relents upon learning that Gabe was also engaging in name-calling and Gabe is shocked that Janice would take Payton's side against him. At the shoot the girls are getting ready when Kehoe walks onto the set. Episode 4.5: Love is a Four- Letter Word Kehoe invades the Tinte shoot to try to make his case to Janet, who rejects him again. Janice convinces the client to do some test shots with Hazuki, although they do not commit to using her in the ad campaign. The client selects Xian to be the \\"face of Tinte\\" Janice's daughter Savannah arrives at the model house and, supposedly needing help with her homework, questions the models on United States history. Following the questioning, a love note from one model to another is slipped under Janice's door. The client has Traci pose topless and she is concerned because of Janice's repeated suggestions that she is fat. Janice brings in her yoga instructor to help the models with their flexibility but many of the models struggle with the postures. Ed Hardy representatives call upon Janice again and book Payton to be the spokesmodel for the company's new underwear line. At the shoot they also book Gavyn, Traci and Paul to serve as \\"background models\\" in the shoot. Through her hidden camera array, Janice discovers that Chandler and Xian are romantically involved. Janice meets with Xian to advise her against becoming involved with fellow models. Maurice also expresses his interest in Polina; he cooks her dinner but Polina is uninterested in a relationship because she already has a boyfriend. Kehoe returns yet again and Janice refuses to see him. Sorin and Crystal exchange back massages and Janice catches them on her hidden camera. The next morning, she angrily confronts Sorin and orders him to stay away from the models. Episode 4.6: Designer Cracks the Whip Couturier Merlin Castell to cast girls for a Barbarella-themed fashion show. Janice interviews about her excitement at the potential of landing a high-fashion client. Merlin is dissatisfied with the models, saying they are too large and do not walk well, but he agrees to give the agency another chance. Chandler disparages Traci and Janice catches him on hidden camera. Janice confronts him and he promises not to make such comments again. Merlin returns to fit his outfits to the models. He sees a little potential in some of them but thinks they would require a lot of work. He shocks Crystal, the one model Janice considers high-fashion, by calling her too commercial, but agrees to give her another chance. Finally he hires her. He also hires Pierce, CC, Polina, Nadia, Erika, Selina, Mia, and Hazuki. Janice brings in performance coach Cindera Che to teach the female models how to move. Janice interviews that she remains concerned with Traci's attitude. Merlin drops in unexpectedly and Janice invites him to watch the lesson. Then the men return and Cindera incorporates them into the lesson. Crystal chooses to partner with Chandler, to Sorin and Xian's displeasure. Xian retaliates by choosing Danny over Chandler. Maurice is excited that Polina chose him. Cindera selects Xian as the best student. After the class, Sorin finds out that Chandler and Crystal slept together in the back yard. With his limited English, he does not understand that they slept next to each other, not that they had sex. Sorin creates a scene and embarrasses Crystal, Xian and Chandler. Sorin apologizes to Crystal and Crystal and Chandler and Xian and Chandler talk things out. Meanwhile, Paul expresses his feelings for Traci, who based on past instructions from Janice, turns him down. At the rehearsal for his show, Merlin remains worried that the models will not be able to deliver what he wants. He paints their faces chalk white and demonstrates a series of moves he expects them to make on the runway, including deep back bends. Several of the models have difficulty with the bend. Nevertheless, they all perform well at the show and the client interviews that he will definitely hire them again. Episode 4.7: Livin' Large Seven 'til Midnight, a new client specializing in costume-type lingerie, attend a casting for their new line. They cast Dominic, Xian and Selina. The client then shocks Janice by asking to see some plus-size models. With the client threatening to go elsewhere, Nathan scrambles to locate three models, Amber, Alana and Ivory. The client books Ivory. At the Seven 'til Midnight shoot, the client is very impressed with Ivory, less so with Dominic. Janice interviews that she is adamantly opposed to plus-size models because she has worked her entire career to remain thin. Nathan takes Janice aside and explains to her that plus-size models are needed to keep the agency afloat. Janice lets Ivory know how pleased the client is with her and then has to leave. The plus-size models spark a spirited discussion among several of the existing models about diet, body type and weight issues. Xian in particular mentions that she is happy with her body and will not make herself unhealthy for the sake of modeling. Returning client Andrew Christian wants two men and one woman to model a new product inspired by Danny's previous photo shoot. The product is a boxer brief with built-in support for the wearer's backside. During the casting, Janice surprises Xian by dismissing her for not being toned. Andrew selects Nadia, Dominic and Christian. At the shoot, Andrew asks Janice if Nadia will pose topless. Nadia agrees as long as the set is closed. Andrew interviews that he is very pleased again with all of Janice's models and would definitely continue to work with the agency. Nathan invites the plus-size models to move into the house. He interviews that he wants to make them feel they are part of the agency and have access to everything the agency offers. He moves them into a room, but without enough beds in the house, Paul is displaced. Several of the existing models check out the situation and Chandler and Alana immediately clash. Episode 4.8: Size Does Matter While Chandler and Alana continue to clash and Janice agonizes about the plus-size division, Martin tells the plus models that he empathizes with their struggle, comparing their struggles with his own struggles as a deaf model. Representatives of PLUS Model magazine arrive at the house for a casting. Janice initially bolts from the casting but, to support Nathan, returns. However, she continues to argue against the idea of plus-size modeling with her models in front of the client. Despite the conflict, creative director Mia Amber hires Ivory and Alana. Janice arrives at the shoot during Alana's final look and criticizes Alana. Publicist Lizzie Grubman arrives at the shoot and tries to mediate between Janice and Mia, but Janice remains resistant. Lizzie returns to the house with Janice and tries to convince her to relocate to New York City. Danny and Chandler clash over the affections of Xian. Danny acts aggressively but Chandler interviews that he has no intention of jeopardizing his place with the agency by fighting. Xian interviews that she is simply a flirt. Janice and models Dominique, Gavyn and Kehoe are hired for a book by photographer Justin Monroe called \\"Down the Rabbit Hole\\". Before the shoot, Janice advises Kehoe that she is not prepared to work with him and orders him off the shoot. Danny replaces him and Kehoe tries to figure out how to get back to Los Angeles. The shoot, despite being named for an Alice in Wonderland concept, has a Wizard of Oz theme. Swimwear designers Parke & Ronen arrive at the house for a casting and hire Michael, Christian, Peyton and Maurice. The shoot is the day after the exhausting Justin Monroe shoot and Janice, feeling ill, declines to attend the shoot. Ronen becomes very agitated by Janice's absence. They argue by phone and Janice hangs up on him. Episode 4.9: Everything is About to Change J. P. expresses his desire to take a new step in his career and Janice promotes him to become an agent. Janice confronts the models about their behaviour in the house, revealing her hidden camera setup. Janice meets with Todd Michael Krim of Reality Cares, a charity organization composed of reality television stars, to book about 14 models for a \\"green\\" fashion show. All of the clothes are made of recycled materials. Janice fires Traci, stating that she's more interested in being an actress than a model. She also fires Alana and Ivory for not fitting her dream of being high fashion. Amber quits in support of her fellow plus size models. Janice gathers the models and announces that she is moving to New York City to further her vision of creating a high fashion boutique agency. She tells Crystal that she is taking her to New York and tells J. P. that he will be the head of the New York men's division. Nathan remains behind, although the future of the Los Angeles agency remains unclear. Episode 4.10: Reunited and it Feels so Good Janice and the models reunite. Janice airs footage from the series and from her hidden cameras and several of the models are abashed at the revelations. Janice subjects Brian Kehoe to a lie detector test to determine if he is straight or gay. The results indicate that he is straight, but has previously kissed another man.

Research Environmental DNA During his MSc project Willerslev and colleagues were the first to obtain ancient DNA directly from ice cores. Later, Willerslev and his team expanded on this approach and was the first to show that DNA from plants, mammals and birds can be obtained directly from environmental samples (environmental DNA) ancient as well as modern. He later showed that environmental DNA can also be obtained from a variety of settings including basal ice and revealed a forested Greenland some 400,000 years ago questioning if southern Greenland was ice free during the last interglacial. His team has also used environmental DNA to reveal forested refugia in Scandinavia during the last interglacial, and that forbs rather than grasses were dominating the steppe environments of the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene and was an important food source for the megafauna. Using environmental DNA, Willerslev and collaborators estimated that woolly mammoth in mainland Alaska survived more than 3,500 years earlier than previously thought, thereby dismissing the Blitzkrieg and Impact hypotheses for megafauna extinction. They also clarified the importance of climate change as a driver of megafauna population dynamics, and the decline of protein rich forbs during the Pleistocene extinctions. In 2017 Willerslev's team was the first to apply a metagenomic approach to environmental DNA, reconstructing the biological succession of North America's interior Ice-Free Corridor. Environmental DNA analyses showed the Ice-Free Corridor's transition from being a steppe environment with mammoth and bison, to an open populous-dominated forest inhabited by elk, and ending as the conifer forest with species like moose we see today. They also claim the interior Ice-Free Corridor is not the first route for early Americans moving south to lower North America from Alaska, given that it first became viable for human occupation at 12.6 thousand years ago, i.e., after Clovis and pre- Clovis occupation was seen in the lower 48 states. Ice Age megafaunal extinctions Willerslev lead the team that published in 2011 a large-scale genetic study on the population dynamics of six Late Pleistocene megafaunal species across the northern hemisphere: woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, muskox, and reindeer, coupling their genetic data with climate nice modelling and the archaeological record. They found that climate has been a major driver of population change over the past 50 thousand years. However, each species responded differently to the effects of climatic change and human contact. Climate change can explain the extinction the Eurasian musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, while it is more likely that a combination of climate and humans was responsible for the extinction of Eurasian steppe bison and wild horse. The causes behind the extinction of the woolly mammoth were ambiguous. They did not find any genetic signature or any distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct (woolly mammoth and rhino) from surviving species (horse, musk ox, and reindeer), revealing the challenges associated with predicting future responses of extant mammals to climate and human- derived change to their habitats. First sequencing of an ancient human genome In 2010, a team led by Willerslev sequenced the genome of a 4,000-year-old man from the Saqqaq culture of Greenland from his hair. This was the first ancient human genome to be sequenced. The DNA obtained from the hair was fragmented into an average size of 55 base pairs. They revealed that the Saqqaq peoples represent a migration from Siberia to the Americas that is separate from that of Native American and Inuit ancestors. In 2014 his team showed that all paleoeskimos in the New World representing several distinct cultures all belonged to the same population as the Saqqaq man and that they lived in genetic isolation from Native Americans for almost 5,000 years before they died out some 700 years ago. This was the first genetic evidence for cultural change happening in isolation through the spread of ideas within a population rather than through meetings between different groups of peoples as seen e.g. during the European Neolithisation. Early peopling of the Americas In 2008 Willerslev led the DNA study on coprolites from the Paisley Caves in Oregon showing human presence in North America more than 14,000 years ago and some 1000 years prior to Clovis. In 2013 his team discovered a genetic link between western Eurasians and Native Americans by sequencing the genome of the 24,000-year-old Mal¬¥ta boy from central Siberia, showing that all contemporary Native Americans carry approximately 1/3 of their genome from the Mal‚Äôta population. In 2014 his team sequenced the Clovis-age genome from the 12,600-year-old Anzick boy from Montana and found it to be ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans thereby rejecting the Solutrean theory for early peopling of the Americas. The skeleton of the boy was later reburied by the support of Willerslev and this event facilitated his adoption into the Crow tribe.\\"For Crow-indianerne er han ¬ªWell-known Wolf¬´\\". www.b.dk. Retrieved 7 October 2014 In 2015 Willerslev's team sequenced the genome of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 8,500 year old skeleton whose origin have been heavily debated. The DNA analyses showed Kennewick to be closer related to Native Americans than to any other contemporary groups and rejecting claims of Kennewick Man being closely related to Japanese Ainu or Europeans. It has been discussed how the first people migrated into the Americas from Siberia. Two theories dominated: 1) People migrated through an ice-free corridor between the ice masses which around the end of the last ice age covered large areas of North America. 2) People migrated along the Pacific coast. In a paper in the scientific journal Nature in 2016 Willerslev and co-authors showed that this ice-free corridor could not sustain humans until much later thereby making it most likely that the early Americans migrated along the Pacific coast. In 2018, the Willerslev team found a new group of peoples in the Americas that they termed ‚ÄúAncient Beringians‚Äù ‚Äì the earliest group of Native Americans to have diversified. This was done through sequencing the genome of an 11.5-thousand-year-old skeleton from Upward Sun River (USR) in Alaska. From this genome they could infer that: # the initial split between East Asians and Native Americans happened around 36 thousand years ago, with gene flow persisting until around 25 thousand years ago, likely when this group entered the Americas from Siberia. # Gene flow from the Malt√°-like ancestor in Siberia into all Native Americans took place 25‚Äì20 thousand years ago, i.e., just around the time of entrance into the Americas. # That Ancient Beringians diversified from other Native Americans some 22‚Äì18.1 thousand years ago and are thus basal to the northern and southern Native American branches that diversified around 17.5‚Äì14.6-11.5 thousand years and to which all other Native Americans belong. # That after 11.5 thousand years, some of the northern Native American populations received gene flow from a Siberian population more closely related to Koryaks than to Palaeo-Eskimos, Inuit, or Kets as has previously been suggested. # That Native American gene flow into Inuit was through northern and not southern Native American groups as previously argued by the Reich group. Their findings finally suggest that the far-northern North American presence of northern Native Americans is from a back migration that replaced or absorbed the initial founding population of ‚ÄùAncient Beringians‚Äù. Peopling of Australia In 2011 Willerslev's team sequenced the first Aboriginal Australian genome from an historically ancient tuft of hair. The study revealed that Aboriginal Australians diversified from the Africans some 20-30 thousand years prior to the evolutionary split between Europeans and Asians. Secondary gene flow has resulted in Aboriginal Australians being closer related to Asians than to Europeans. This study was followed up with a new study in 2016 in the journal Nature about the genetic history of the Australian Aboriginals. Early peopling of Europe Willerslev's team sequenced the genome of one of the earliest anatomically modern humans from Europe, Kostinki 14 from Russia dated to be between 36-38,000 years old. The results show that most of the major genetic components present in Europeans today was present in Europe from early on. In 2014 his team undertook the first large scale past population genomic study reporting more than 100 ancient genomes from Bronze Age Europe and Asia. They found that lactose tolerance that is common in northern Europe today was not common even as late as 2,000 years ago. They also found evidence for major populations movements and replacements in both Europe and Asia during the Bronze Age time and that significant parts of contemporary European and Asian genetic diversity was created during this period. They later showed that plague was a likely driver of Bronze Age population dynamics, which as of 2015 is the oldest genomes of Yersinia pestis (the etiological agent of plague) reported. Early peopling of Central and South Asia In 2018, Willerslev and colleges published 2 papers in Nature and Science the same day addressing the population history of Central and Southern Asia. The Science paper deals with the spread of the Bronze Age pastoralists, such as Yamnaya and the peoples they met in Asia. They could show that descendants of the 24-thousand-year-old Malt√° boy from Siberia survived in Central Asia until at least 5 thousand years ago and were the occupants of Botai ‚Äì an archaeological site in Kazakhstan holding the oldest evidence of horse domestication some 5-6 thousand years ago. They further showed that in contrast to Europe, early Bronze Age expansion of Yamnaya into Asia had limited genetic and linguistic impact in either Central Asia or in South Asia, opposite to earlier claims by the Reich group from Harvard. The paper thereby challenges the so-called ‚ÄúSteppe Hypothesis‚Äù for early spread of the Indo-European languages that seem to explain the early expansion of Indo-European languages into Europe but not Asia. The latter is argued to have happened by later Bronze groups, such as the Sintashta, and reaching all the way to India and Pakistan. The accompanying Nature paper is based on 137 ancient human genomes of the Eurasian steppe mainly from the time following the Bronze Age. They find the genetics of the mounted Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppes throughout the Iron Age were highly diverse, consisting of several ethnicities of European and Asian origins despite its highly uniform culture. Later, Scythians admixed and were replaced by steppe nomads from the east coming out of the Xiongnu confederations of Mongolia and China, including the westward-expanding Huns (fourth‚Äìfifth century AD). These were later admixed and replaced by expanding East Asian groups including Genghis Khan in the Medieval period. Accordingly, the events transformed the Eurasian steppes from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely West Eurasian ancestry to the mostly Turkic-speaking groups of the present day, who are primarily of East Asian ancestry. According to Willerslev, this was all due to the long-distance traveling enabled by domestication of the horse.https://magazin.spiegel.de/SP/2018/20/157298262/ Peopling of Southeast Asia In 2018 Willerslev lead an international research team sequencing 26 ancient human genome sequences from across Southeast Asia, some dating back 8 thousand years, 4 thousand years earlier than previous sequences from the region.https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/index.php/ancient-dna-testing- solves-100-year-old-controversy-southeast-asian-prehistory This was made possible by a modified whole genome capture approach. They used this data to test two hypotheses on southeast Asian population history: One theory argues that the indigenous H√≤ab√¨nhian hunter-gatherers who populated Southeast Asia from 44,000 years ago adopted agricultural practices independently, without the input from early farmers from East Asia. A second theory, referred to as the ‚Äòtwo-layer model‚Äô favours the view that migrating rice farmers from what is now China replaced the indigenous H√≤ab√¨nhian hunter-gatherers. They determined that neither interpretation fits the complexity of Southeast Asian history and that contemporary Southeast Asians have been influenced by at least four migration waves. The first wave is represented by H√≤ab√¨nhian hunter-gatherers who were closely genetically related to traditional hunter- gatherers in Malaysia, the Philippines, and the Andaman Islands (so-called ‚Äúnegritos‚Äù). The second wave derived from mainland China and brought with them farming economies such as rice 4000 years ago and mixed with the H√≤ab√¨nhians. These were followed by two additional migration waves; by 2 thousand years ago, Southeast Asian individuals carried additional East Asian ancestry components. One component likely represents the introduction of ancestral Kradai languages in Mainland southeast Asia, and another the Austronesian expansion reaching Indonesia by 2.1 thousand years ago and the Philippines by 1.8 thousand years ago. Among their genomes was also an ancient J≈çmon genome from Japan that showed shared genetic history with the H√≤ab√¨nhians. Past disease genetics Willerslevs team has been the first to conduct large scale genome sequencing of ancient pathogens. In 2015 they showed that plague was a likely driver of Bronze Age population dynamics, which as of 2015 represents the oldest genomes of Yersinia pestis (the etiological agent of plague) reported. Later they showed that westward-expanding Huns carried with them plague that was basal to the Justinian plague, and are thus the likely source of this plaque entering into Europe with the devastating consequence of killing millions as a result. In 2018 they published a large-scale study on ancient genomes of Hepatitis B (HBV). They found evidence of a long-term association of modern HBV genotypes with humans dating back at least 4,5 thousand years, which includes genotypes that are now extinct. They also found that in several cases, the geographical locations of the ancient genotypes do not match present-day distributions. Genotypes that today are typical of Africa and Asia, as well as a subgenotype from India, are shown to have an early Eurasian presence with humans, revealing a complexity of HBV evolution that is not evident when considering modern sequences alone. Other research Willerslev also led a study showing that living bacteria can take up ancient DNA by natural transformation allowing for genomic recycling of ancient genetic traits, and another study showing the survival of bacteria cells in permafrost for about 1/2 million years. Willerslev and collaborators have sequenced the genome of a 700,000-year-old horse from Yukon in Canada, which as of 2016 is the oldest genome ever sequenced. Outreach Willerslev appears regularly in media such as magazines, newspapers, radio and TV when discussions turn to human evolution, migration, and the role of science in society. He and his staff at the Centre for GeoGenetics have participated in feature films like First Peoples (PBS), the Great Human Odyssey and Code Breakers (both Clearwater) and Search for the Head of John the Baptist and How to Build and Ancient Man (both National Geographic). In 2016 he was featured in a profile article in The New York Times. Personal life His father's education of him and his brother was rather authoritarian, and included frequent physical challenges, such as obstacle paths and swimming in ice water, already at the age of six. His father thought this would help them to become hardy later in life. Willerslev's father was fiercely atheist. However, influenced by numerous experiences living with native people, Willerslev came to respect, and to some extent believe, in supernatural powers unknown to science. Such experiences included encounters with descendants of Sitting Bull and trapper tribes in Siberia: > \\"Something similar happened to me when I shot a bear in Siberia. The > tradition there is that you pin the bear's head high up in a tree, > overlooking where the bear had its hunting grounds. I refused and instead > took the bear's head with me home as a trophy. Back home, everything started > to go wrong for me, and I suffered terrible nightmares. In Siberia the > trappers had told me, if I didn't hang up the head as required, all the > bears in the world would know about it and hate me for it. I then took a > trip to our summer house in Sweden and pinned up the bear's head in a tree > there, and the nightmares stopped.\\" At the age of 32, he became baptized as Christian, although he declares himself as \\"religious, but not Christian\\". Willerslev married Ulrikke Ji Mee Willerslev in 2007. They have the sons Rasken Willerslev and Bror Willerslev. The family lives in Kongens Lyngby.

Photogravure published in Camera Work, No 9, 1905 Life Watson-Sch√ºtze, n√©e Eva Lawrence Watson, was born in Jersey City, New Jersey on September 16, 1867. Her parents were Dr. John and Mary Lawrence Watson, whose family had come from Scotland. She was the youngest of four children, but little else is known about her family or early childhood. In 1883, when she was sixteen, she enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she studied under well-known painter and photographer Thomas Eakins. Her interests at that time were watercolor and oil painting, and it‚Äôs unknown if she took any interests in Eakins‚Äô photography. Around the 1890s Watson began to develop a passion for photography, and soon she decided to make it her career. Between 1894 and 1896 she shared a photographic studio with Amelia Van Buren another Academy alumna in Philadelphia, and the following year she opened her own portrait studio. She quickly became known for her pictorialist style, and soon her studio was known as a gathering place for photographers who championed this aesthetic vision. In 1897 she wrote to photographer Frances Benjamin Johnston about her belief in women‚Äôs future in photography: \\"There will be a new era, and women will fly into photography.\\" In 1898 six of her photographs were chosen to be exhibited at the first Philadelphia Photographic Salon, where she exhibited under the name Eva Lawrence Watson. It was through this exhibition that she became acquainted with Alfred Stieglitz, who was one of the judges for the exhibit. In 1899 she was elected as a member of the Photographic Society of Philadelphia. Photographer and critic Joseph Keiley praised the work she exhibited that year, saying she showed \\"delicate taste and artistic originality\\". \\"A Study Head\\", by Eva Watson-Sch√ºtze. Photogravure published in left The following year she was a member of the jury for the Philadelphia Photographic Salon. A sign of her stature as a photographer at that time may be seen by looking at the other members of the jury, who were Alfred Stieglitz, Gertrude Kasebier, Frank Eugene and Clarence H. White. In 1900 Johnston asked her to submit work for a groundbreaking exhibition of American women photographers in Paris. Watson objected at first, saying \\"It has been one of my special hobbies ‚Äì and one I have been very emphatic about, not to have my work represented as ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs work‚Äô. I want [my work] judged by only one standard irrespective of sex.\\" Johnston persisted, however, and Watson had twelve prints ‚Äì the largest number of any photographer ‚Äì in the show that took place in 1901. In 1901 she married Professor Martin Sch√ºtze, a German-born and -trained lawyer who had received his Ph.D. in German literature from the University of Pennsylvania in 1899. He took a teaching position in Chicago, where the couple soon moved. That same year she was elected a member of The Linked Ring. She found the ability to correspond with some of the most progressive photographers of the day very invigorating, and she began to look for similar connections in the U.S. In 1902 she suggested the idea of forming an association of independent and like-minded photographers to Alfred Stieglitz. They corresponded several times about this idea, and by the end of the year she joined Stieglitz as one of the founding members of the famous Photo-Secession. About 1903 Watson-Sch√ºtze began to spend summers in Woodstock at the Byrdcliffe Colony in the Catskill Mountains of New York. She and her husband later bought land nearby and built a home they called \\"Hohenwiesen\\" (High Meadows) where she would spend most of her summer and autumn months from about 1910 until about 1925. In 1905 Joseph Keiley wrote a lengthy article about her in Camera Work saying she was \\"one of the staunchest and sincerest upholders of the pictorial movement in America.\\" As she began to spend more time at Byrdcliffe her interests in painting were reawakened, and within a few years she was spending more time in front of a canvas than behind a camera. She became a student of William Emile Schumacher, an American painter who exhibited at the famous Armory Show of 1913. After 1910 she made fewer and fewer photographs, and by 1920 she had ceased photography except for family photos. 272x272px In 1929 Watson-Sch√ºtze became the director of The Renaissance Society, a non-collecting museum founded in 1915 at the University of Chicago. Under Watson-Sch√ºtze's direction from 1929 to 1935, the society presented groundbreaking exhibitions of early modernists such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Jean Arp, Joan Mir√≥, and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. It was said of her tenure there, \\"In those six years she transformed the group from a largely amateurish, unfocused organization into an internationally recognized, truly vanguard institution advancing a rigorous modernist agenda.\\" Watson-Sch√ºtze died in Chicago in 1935. Later that year the Renaissance Society held a memorial exhibition of her work. It included 32 paintings and 2 drawings but none of her photographs. Since Watson-Sch√ºtze's death there have been two retrospective exhibitions of her photographs: Eva Watson-Sch√ºtze, Chicago Photo-Secessionist, () at the University of Chicago Library in 1985, and Eva Watson-Sch√ºtze, Photographer, at the Samuel Dorsky Museum Art at the State University of New York at New Paltz in 2009.

The story begins at an undisclosed date, but was traditionally believed to have taken place in the year 2205 due to statements made in several of the publications devoted to Yamato III (such as its 'Roman Album'A Roman(ce) Album is a Japanese book containing artwork, cinematic digests, character and mechanical designs, and production notes, for a Japanese animation production. It is usually published with some degree of assistance from the production studio, and is designed to be read by fans.). However, the sequel film, Final Yamato, explicitly took place in late 2203, so after the film was released, the date of Yamato III was assumed to be early 2203. Plot The plot centers about the drama which ensues when a stray proton missile, from a battle between the Galman Empire and the Bolar Federation, crashes into the Sun causing nuclear fusion to accelerate to unsafe levels. The Yamato and crew must then set out on a mission to look for a new world for the human race. They must do so in less than one year. The English adaptation was known as Star Blazers: The Bolar Wars. There were plans for a fourth season, an American-produced sequel, but it never materialised. A planned web comic series based on Space Battleship Yamato III was scheduled to be released for October 2009. Over the course of the story, the Yamato and crew must complete their mission of finding a new home for Earthlings amidst the strife caused by the Galman-Bolar conflict. The Galmans, we learn, are the ancestral race from which the Gamilas came. After the battle with the Dark Nebula Empire ended, a battle which destroyed the planet Gamilas, Desler and his remaining forces set out to search for this ancestral homeland. They found Galman, enslaved by the cruel grey-skinned aliens known as the Bolars. They promptly liberated Galman, and a galaxy-wide war ensued. The Yamato and crew eventually catch up with Desler, who is deeply remorseful that Earth has been dragged into this conflict. Desler dispatches a team of Gamilas-Galman scientists to attempt to restore the Sun. This effort ultimately fails. During the course of the mission, the Yamato rescues Ruda, the exiled queen of the mysterious and hidden planet, Shalbart. It turns out that she is worshipped by peace-seeking factions within both the Galman and Bolar empires, and is wanted (preferably dead) by both governments which fear her influence. This puts a strain on the fragile alliance between Earth and the Galmans, and causes the Bolars to declare outright war against Earth. Earth is finally saved when the Yamato brings Ruda to Shalbart, and she decides to give the Earthlings a device (the Hydro-Cosmogen Gun) that can restore the Sun's natural fusion balance. But even this only succeeds after some ultimate sacrifices on the part of some of Yamato's crew.

Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning contract law and arbitration. The case arose from a class action filed in Florida against a payday lender alleging the loan agreements the plaintiffs had signed were unenforceable because they essentially charged a higher interest rate than that permitted under Florida law. The lending agreements called for all disputes between the borrower and lender to be settled in arbitration. The original plaintiffs argued that the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, was invalid because it violated the law. When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a majority of seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and voidable contracts, requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the arbitration clause was itself challenged.. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law. Background of the case In 1978, the court's Marquette Bank decision, which held that under the National Banking Act of 1863 states could not enforce their anti-usury laws against nationally chartered banks based in other states, opened the door to increased credit card spending by Americans. Other forms of consumer credit, such as title and payday loans, became available for those who could not get even the most restrictive credit cards available. Social activists criticized the banks and companies that engaged in those practices, calling them predatory lenders who targeted the poor with promises of no credit check and easy money that only came at extremely high interest rates, profiting when the loans were extended long beyond the original short term.King, Uriah, Parrish, Leslie and Tanik, Ozlem; ; November 30, 2006; retrieved September 29, 2008. Most such lenders had their customers sign credit agreements that included arbitration clauses specifying that all disputes were to be resolved through that process rather than litigation. Arbitration in turn was criticized as a business-friendly forum which furthered the exploitation of consumers most in need of money.Public Citizen, , September 2007, retrieved October 13, 2008., Lawsuits over these contracts, however, were increasingly dismissed by lower courts that followed the Supreme Court's Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co.Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., . case, which created the separability doctrine, under which all issues in contracts with arbitration clauses, save the clause itself, were to be decided by the arbitrator and not a court, under the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In Southland Corp. v. Keating,Southland Corp. v. Keating, . the Court held the FAA, and thus the separability doctrine, applicable to contracts executed under state law as well. Litigation history In 1999, John Cardegna, a Palm Beach County 9-1-1 operator, took out a $337.50 payday loan from a local branch of The Check Cashing Store, a subsidiary of Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., a Dublin, Ohio-based company (now Checksmart). Later he took out another loan, for $150. Unable to repay either from his paychecks, he kept rolling over his loan by paying the fee to do so. Eventually these came to over $1,000, and with the help of an activist lawyers' group, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), he filed a class action alleging that the fees he was charged were effectively interest payments at a 1,300% annual rate, well over Florida's legal limit of 45%. The class would eventually be certified to include all the store's customers prior to September 30, 2001, reflecting a change in Florida law which allowed the fees. The company moved to have the case dismissed and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed on the grounds that the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA. Buckeye petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, and it was granted in 2005. Since several of the appeals circuits had ruled in favor of arbitration in similar cases, but the Alabama Supreme Court had agreed with its Florida counterpart, the case was closely watched by the arbitration industry and consumer advocates. Before the Court Briefs Christopher Landau of the Washington firm Kirkland & Ellis, a former clerk to justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, argued for Buckeye Check; Paul Bland of TLPJ represented Cardegna. Many banking and business groups filed amici briefs on the company's behalf. Landau's brief reiterated much of the argument Florida's Justice Cantero had made in his dissent: that it did not matter whether the claim was that the contract had been fraudulently induced as in Prima Paint or that it was illegal on its face, as it was here. \\"Whether the underlying contract is good, bad or indifferent is of no legitimate concern to the court,\\" he wrote. \\"If the parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute, and do not challenge either the arbitration agreement itself or their assent to the underlying contract, that is the end of the matter as far as the court is concerned.\\" Otherwise, arbitration clauses were pointless as anyone could avoid them by filing a suit challenging the contract.Landau, Christopher; , 18, retrieved September 2, 2008. Bland argued that an illegal contract cannot exist, much less be enforced in any way: He also reminded the justices of the heavy presumption against pre-empting state law,Bland, 9-12. particularly in the area of contract formation, and that Prima Paint did not apply to the sections of the FAA under issue.Bland, 13-19. In a reply brief Landau insisted again that the court's previous jurisprudence made it quite clear that the arbitration clause could only be negated if separately challenged. He accused the respondents of having a covert agenda to overturn the controlling cases. \\"The reason that Prima Paint and Southland have stood the test of time is no mystery: those decisions are eminently sensible.\\", he concluded.Landau, , 2, retrieved September 3, 2008. Another amicus brief was filed by Theis Research, a California company with a certiorari petition then before the Court in a similar caseTheis Research Inc. v. Brown & Bain, 240 F.3d 795 (9th Cir. 2001). it had brought against a law firm that had failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest prior to patent litigation in which it represented Theis. While differing on some procedural points with Bland's brief, Theis lawyer Paul Johnson likewise urged the court to rule in Cardegna's favor lest the Arbitration Act become \\"a Trojan Horse to assault the citadel of police powers vested in the states\\".Johnson, Paul; , 1, Retrieved September 3, 2008. Oral argument At oral argument, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor (one of two dissenters in Southland) and John Roberts seemed receptive to Bland's argument that no clause of a contract illegal under state law, including an arbitration clause, can be enforced. \\"The state itself makes a decision that certain contracts can't be entered into\\", O'Connor said. Ruth Bader Ginsburg likewise was not convinced that Prima Paint, which had arisen from a suit filed in federal court, applied to states as well. Roberts and John Paul Stevens also saw the potential for conflict of interest in an arbitrator ruling on the legality of the contract. \\"The arbitrator always has an interest in finding that the contract is valid and arbitrable because that's his source of business ‚Äî arbitrating disputes\\", said the latter. On the other side, Anthony Kennedy felt that Prima Paint and subsequent decisions had \\"certainly displaced the states and state law from this area [to] a very substantial extent\\". It was up to the Court to resolve confusion similar to that created in the instant case, he added. Antonin Scalia worried that ruling in Cardegna's favor would open the floodgates of litigation. \\"All you have to do is open the door and you will have litigation in court,\\" Ginsburg agreed, \\"and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would otherwise decide.\\" Decision Antonin Scalia Less than two months after oral argument, the justices ruled 7-1 for Buckeye. O'Connor had retired and been replaced by Samuel Alito, who as he had not seated for oral argument took no part in the decision. Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. The Florida Supreme Court's distinction between void and voidable contracts was, as Cantero had said, irrelevant under Prima Paint and Southland. The relevant section of the FAA was indeed applicable to the case, he said, since it required that contracts with arbitration clauses be treated like all others, and that its definition of \\"contract\\" included those that would or could later be voided since it explicitly mentioned such contracts that might later be revoked.Buckeye Check Cashing, 546 U.S. at 443. Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter. He wrote a single paragraph citing his three earlier dissents in similar cases and restated his belief that the FAA does not pre-empt state law.Buckeye Check Cashing, 546 U.S. at 447 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Aftermath After the case was remanded to the Florida courts in which it had originated, the parties eventually settled. In 2008 the company agreed to pay $7 million into a fund. Of that amount, $2.1 million went to pay the plaintiffs' lawyers. The members of the class, potentially 70,000 in number, divided the rest. Legacy The case established a precedent and was seen as expanding the scope of earlier court rulings applying the FAA to the states. The Court itself relied on it in a later opinion, and legal scholars have discussed its impact and implications. Subsequent jurisprudence Two years later, the Court heard Preston v. Ferrer,. the case brought by the former manager of Alex Ferrer (television's Judge Alex) against him. Ferrer had moved to bypass arbitration, arguing both that Preston was not licensed by California to work as a talent agent and thus could not legally contract with him for such services, and that that state's Talent Agencies Act required that all such disputes be considered by the state labor commissioner's office first. He argued that this distinguished the case from Buckeye Check. This time it was Justice Ginsburg who wrote for the 8-1 majority that the FAA compelled arbitration even when state law vested dispute resolution authority in a specific state regulatory body. Again, Thomas wrote a short dissent reiterating his position and this time including Buckeye Check among his prior opinions to this effect. Criticism and commentary Proponents of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution have seen in the decision a reassuring reaffirmation of the separability principle that cleared up whether it covered a challenge to the legality of the underlying contract. \\"While seemingly a mere reiteration of Prima Paint's holding,\\" the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (IICPR) wrote, \\"the Buckeye decision both clarifies and expands an arbitrator's jurisdiction by adding potentially void contracts to an arbitrator‚Äôs domain and by unequivocally extending the severability and validity principles into state court.\\"McLaughlin, Joseph T.; Scanlon, Kathleen M. and Clare, James; , retrieved September 4, 2008 The decision left open the question of whether it was still for the courts to decide if a contract had been properly formed, however, and some lower courts had denied motions to compel arbitration when that was the issue. Lawyers from the international arbitration department at White & Case praised the decision for making U.S. law \\"consistent with current international arbitration case law and doctrine\\", under which separability has a stronger foundation than it does in the U.S. \\"[It] avoids damage to the reputation of the United States as a 'safe' host of international arbitration.\\"McDougall, Andrew de Lotbini√©re and Ioannou, Leon; , Mealey's International Arbitration Report; March 2006; retrieved September 4, 2008. Those who approached from a consumer-rights standpoint were not as solicitous. Texas arbitration expert Alan Scott Rau called Scalia's phrasing \\"sloppy and unguarded\\", noting it failed to recognize that some challenges to a contract that the law reserves for courts, such as capacity and forgery, necessarily include the arbitration clause.Rau, Alan Scott; Alan Scott \\"Separability\\" in the United States Supreme Court, 2006 Stockholm Int'l Arb. Rev. 1, cited at Ware, Stephen; , 8 Nevada Law Journal 107, 117, 2007. Stephen Ware of Kansas calls on Congress to repeal the separability doctrine and require that courts be permitted to compel arbitration only after they have heard and rejected any challenges to the validity of the contract itself: \\"The separability doctrine separates arbitration law from an important part of contract law ‚Äî the defenses to enforcement ‚Äî and thus fails to provide the right to litigate with the protection of those defenses.\\"Ware, 121., \\"[T]he Buckeye decision forces the lower courts to either continue the search for a workable rule or accept the undermining of the moral foundations of contract law,\\" says Timothy Hall of the University of Louisville's Louis D. Brandeis School of Law.Hall, Timothy S.; , draft; February 15, 2007; 6. \\"Scalia‚Äôs opinion in Buckeye is an astonishing attempt to ... [institute] ... an explicit federal policy imposing arbitration and rejecting judicial resolution of many legal issues.\\"Hall, 17. He, too, notes the fundamental contradiction posed by allowing defenses to contract formation to remain adjudicable by courts. Before and after the decision, most state court cases he looked at challenging contracts on those defenses have been very receptive to arguments, particular unconscionability. He suggests ways both legislative and judicial bodies could remedy this situation.

Background An extensive list of archaic words for medieval crossbowmen is given by Payne-Gallwey. Richardson, in his 1839 dictionary, did not make specific reference to the crossbow in his definition of arbalist: \\"One who casts or shoots from a bow.\\" Hansard (1841) used the word arbalister for a cross-bowman (sic), the same usage as Webster and Johnson who reserved the word arbalist for the crossbow itself. Smith uses arbalist to describe a maker of crossbows. Equipment and competition Modern arbalists shoot crossbows markedly different from medieval artillerymen. Current-day target crossbows must conform to various limitations according to the governing body under which the shoot or tournament is taking place. Firstly, GNAS requires that arbalists shoot at targets separate from archers. Both the World Crossbow Shooting Association (WCSA) and GNAS require that the draw weight maximum be 95 lbs and that the minimum bolt (arrow) length be 12 inches. These organizations differ, however, in allowable maximum bolt length, GNAS citing 15\\", WCSA 18\\". They also disagree as to whether metal prods can be used; GNAS says no, WCSA says yes (with restrictions). Both require that the bolts shall be fletched, GNAS imposing an additional constraint of the number of fletchings (three). Classification GNAS recognizes three grades of arbalist, Master Arbalist (scoring 780 or higher in three qualifying Crossbow Windsor Rounds) Arbalist 1st Class (scoring 630 or higher) and Arbalist 2nd Class (480). A Crossbow Windsor Round is shot on a 60 cm 10-zone face scoring 9,7,5,3,1; three ends at 40 yards, three at 50 yards and three at 60 yards. Archery Australia recognizes five classifications: Grand Master Arbelist (GMA), Master Arbelist (MA), First Class Arbelist (A1), Second Class Arbelist (A2), and Third Class Arbelist (A3). Awards The World Crossbow Shooting Association (WCSA) makes available four sets of Star Achievement Awards (badges) to encourage both participation in tournaments and to provide recognition for reaching certain scores: TC 900 for outdoor target crossbow, SC 600 for outdoor sport crossbow, Indoor 40 for indoor 40 cm face for both target and sport crossbow, and Indoor 25 for indoor 25 cm face for both target and sport crossbow.

Etymology Allen Mawer rather tentatively identified the early place-name Creklawe~Crokelawe attested in 1296 with Cocklaw. If so, the initial cr- points to a Cumbric origin: Cumbric crug 'hill', to which was later added Old English hl«£w 'hill'. But if this identification is incorrect, Cocklaw on its own would more obviously be an entirely Old English word, combining cocc 'cock' and hl«£w 'hill'.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html).  History  Low Cocklaw is situated close to the ancient borough boundary of Berwick-upon- Tweed, which ran north‚Äìsouth at this point, and now forms part of the border between England and Scotland. A road or track runs along this part and, in the past, was a route allowing horse-drawn wagons travelling between England and Scotland to by-pass the tolls through Berwick. There were fords at the crossings of the rivers Tweed and Whiteadder and the wagons would need extra pulling-power to haul them up the hill north of the Whiteadder. Local tradition is that Low Cocklaw derives its name from this; a \\"law\\" being the local word for a hill and a \\"cock-horse\\" being a heavy draught horse. Hence the farm nearest the river, from which a draught horse could be hired, was Low Cocklaw and, for the next stage of the haul, the farm higher up the hill to the north was High Cocklaw. Further north again, on the other side of the hill on the same route, there is a Cocklaw Farm above Ayton village, which would have provided the same service for wagons travelling south from Scotland to England. Low Cocklaw is no longer a farm. It was converted into housing in the 1980s. On 6 July 2020 it had a population of 16, made up of 9 households.

The theater has been recognized for its artistic quality and its role in launching the careers of playwrights including two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner August Wilson. The 135-seat theater serves as a space to showcase the exploration of the African- American experience. Each year, Penumbra performs for over 40,000 people and conducts educational outreach workshops for more than 5,000 students. The theater employs more actors, choreographers, dancers, directors, and administrators of color than all other theaters in Minnesota combined. Located at St Paul's Hallie Q. Brown Community Center in the Martin Luther King Center building, the Penumbra is the largest of three African-American theaters in the United States, has nurtured important talents and created unique spaces for the black voice past and present. Beginnings Due to displacement and segregation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many African Americans were aided by settlement homes for not only economic and social services, but programming for the arts as well. The Hallie Q. Brown Community Center of St. Paul, Minnesota, much like the South Side Settlement house in Chicago and Henry Street Settlement house in New York, wanted to invest more in its art programming because it gave community members the tools to craft a voice within a community through visual arts, music, literature, and theatre. These centers were not only a popular outlet for entertainment, but also a critical part of the Black Arts Movement where African Americans spoke out about racial inequalities and allowed them to shape a sense of identity. The Hallie Q. Brown Community Center's second executive director, Henry R. Thomas, drafted a construction plan to incorporate a fully functional theater within its Martin Luther King Jr. facility to support these demands. In 1976, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) awarded the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center a $150,000 grant to further develop its cultural arts programming. The CETA funding enabled the appointment of Lou Bellamy, a theatre arts graduate student at University of Minnesota, as the center's cultural arts director where he later founded the Penumbra Theatre Company.  1977‚Äì78 productions  Eden (1976) by Steve Carter was the first production to launch of the 1977‚Äì78 season of the Penumbra Theatre Company. It explores diversity of ethnicities within the African-American community. The Negro Ensemble Company had recently premiered this performance, giving the Penumbra a direct tie to the Black Arts movement. Another relation to the movement is Ed Bullins, a prominent editor, theorist, and playwright who wrote Penumbra's second production, the 1975 Broadway transfer of The Taking of Miss Jane. The third production, Heartland, Louisiana, showcases original work by Penumbra's resident playwright, Horace Bond, who was Bellamy's former graduate advisor and mentor. Bond focused mainly on developing African-American productions, particularly in the south. This proved successful in captivating and connecting African-American audiences who either grew up in the heavily segregated south and moved to northern cities or had relatives that had done so. For the fourth production, the Company staged the historic work of William Wells Brown‚Äôs The Escape; or, a Leap for Freedom. Penumbra chose to actively produce plays that dealt with the implications and practices of minstrelsy in an effort to further investigate the history of African-American theatre. Bellamy soon left Mixed Blood theatre as cultural arts director at Hallie Q. Brown Community Center. Penumbra initially identified itself as a multiracial company. While the company‚Äôs members, staff, and audience has always been ethnically diverse, their leadership and productions have a distinguishable dominance of African-American culture.{{Mahala, Macelle (2013). Penumbra: The Premiere Stage for African American Drama. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. p. 9. As its first few seasons continued, it began to fully emerge as an African-American theatre company. \\"Bellamy.. insists that black theater ‚Äì which he defines as stories of the black experience, rooted in the black community, as told by blacks ‚Äì can only be done correctly with a deep understanding of black literature and culture, including the impact of slavery. Without that background, Bellamy says, a director is likely to overlook or misread clues embedded in the text ‚Äì everything from West-African story motifs to the tendency of a race cowed by slavery to hide learning rather than to celebrate it.\\"  Original ensemble company  *Estelene Bell *Mazi Johnson *Claude Purdy *Faye M.

In Penumbra, Bellamy and the other founders explored what black theater could be. \\"What has emerged is a style informed and shaped by the community in which this theater resides,\\" Bellamy said. \\"I want to reflect that community and speak to it.\\" Over time that has come to mean specifically black theater for black audiences, but open to everyone; incorporating historical works of Langston Hughes, new works of August Wilson, adaptions of Zora Neale Hurston's stories and Black Nativity, Penumbra's annual Christmas show, all infused with the essence of black vernacular. Twin Cities theater critic Peter Vaughan attributed Penumbra's national success to these factors: strong artistic quality, solid long-range strategic plan, emphasis on hiring experienced administrators, and increased corporate and foundation support.  Notable company members   August Wilson at the Penumbra  The Penumbra Theater company helped launch Pulitzer-Prize-winning playwright and poet August Wilson early in his career. Encouraged to move to St. Paul from his native Pittsburgh in 1978 by his friend Claude Purdy, he started to write from his experience. Wilson's first play, Black Bart and the Sacred Hills (1977), and later Jitney! (1982) premiered at the Penumbra Theater. His work is still regularly played on the Penumbra stage. > ‚ÄúWe are what we imagine ourselves to be, and we can only imagine what we > know to be possible. The founding of Penumbra Theatre enlarged that > possibility. And its corresponding success provokes the community to a > higher expectation of itself. I became a playwright because I saw where my > chosen profession was being sanctioned by a group of black men and women who > were willing to invest their lives and their talent in assuming a > responsibility for our presence in the world and the conduct of our industry > as black Americans.\\" >  August Wilson, Written to commemorate the 20th anniversary of The > Penumbra Theatre Company in 1996  Lou Bellamy  Lou Bellamy founded the Penumbra theater in 1976, and will stand as the artistic director of the company until 2017, when the position will be filled by his daughter, Sarah Bellamy. He has served as the Associate Professor at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Theatre Arts and Dance for over 30 years. Lou Bellamy is largely credited for the artistic success of the Penumbra theater, as he is responsible for hiring and gestating some of the theater's more notorious artists (Including writer August Wilson and director Claude Purdy). In May 2001, Lou Bellamy won an Obie award for his directorial contribution to August Wilson's Two Trains Running.  Outreach initiatives  In addition to theatrical performances, the Penumbra Theater also runs public events, dialogues, workshops and a variety of other events aimed at social awareness. Programs include the Fund for Improvement of Post- Secondary Education, workshops on race, a summer institute for teenagers, and performances and internships for students.  The African-American Theater History Project  The African-American Theater History Project (also known as Umbra Search), In a partnership between the Penumbra Theater Company and The University of Minnesota with financial support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, addresses the lack of access to primary documentation regarding the history and culture of African-American theater. The project's aim is to collaborate with other African-American theater companies to collect, catalog and archive important historical documents, and make this information publicly available in an online catalog to promote awareness and education regarding the history of African-American theater.

It was collected for the first time by James Dewar in 1899 and published with the title \\"Sur la solidification de l'hydrog√®ne\\" (English: On the solidification of hydrogen) in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 7th series, vol. 18, Oct. 1899.Correspondence and General A-I DEWAR/Box D I Solid hydrogen has a density of 0.086 g/cm3 making it one of the lowest-density solids. Molecular solid hydrogen At low temperatures and at pressures up to around 400 GPa, hydrogen forms a series of solid phases formed from discrete H2 molecules. Phase I occurs at low temperatures and pressures, and consists of a hexagonal close-packed array of freely rotating H2 molecules. Upon increasing the pressure at low temperature, a transition to Phase II occurs at up to 110 GPa. Phase II is a broken-symmetry structure in which the H2 molecules are no longer able to rotate freely. If the pressure is further increased at low temperature, a Phase III is encountered at about 160 GPa. Upon increasing the temperature, a transition to a Phase IV occurs at a temperature of a few hundred kelvin at a range of pressures above 220 GPa. Identifying the atomic structures of the different phases of molecular solid hydrogen is extremely challenging, because hydrogen atoms interact with X-rays very weakly and only small samples of solid hydrogen can be achieved in diamond anvil cells, so that X-ray diffraction provides very limited information about the structures. Nevertheless, phase transitions can be detected by looking for abrupt changes in the Raman spectra of samples. Furthermore, atomic structures can be inferred from a combination of experimental Raman spectra and first-principles modelling. Density functional theory calculations have been used to search for candidate atomic structures for each phase. These candidate structures have low free energies and Raman spectra in agreement with the experimental spectra. Quantum Monte Carlo methods together with a first-principles treatment of anharmonic vibrational effects have then been used to obtain the relative Gibbs free energies of these structures and hence to obtain a theoretical pressure-temperature phase diagram that is in reasonable quantitative agreement with experiment. On this basis, Phase II is believed to be a molecular structure of P21/c symmetry; Phase III is (or is similar to) a structure of C2/c symmetry consisting of flat layers of molecules in a distorted hexagonal arrangement; and Phase IV is (or is similar to) a structure of Pc symmetry, consisting of alternate layers of strongly bonded molecules and weakly bonded graphene-like sheets.

His grandfather was a rabbi. opera director, impresario, composer and writer. Gunsbourg is best known for being the longest-serving director of the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo, where his career spanned almost six decades. left Raoul Gunsbourg acquired his musical education and its comprehensive knowledge in language and literature as a self-taught person. He attended Medical School in Bucharest which he finished in 1875. In 1877-78 he served as a medic in the Russian army during the Russian-Turkish war. In 1881-83 he created and managed the Gunsbourg's French Opera Stage in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In Moscow Gunsbourg met German composer Richard Wagner. After returning to France, Gunsbourg directed the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Lille during the 1888/89 season and the Op√©ra de Nice in 1889-91. In 1892, on recommendation by czar Alexander III of Russia, Gunsbourg was invited by Princess Alice, an American wife of Albert I, Prince of Monaco, to serve as the director of the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. Empowered by Princess Alice's encouragement and support, Gunsbourg transformed the Op√©ra de Monte- Carlo into a world-class cultural venue. He was the first opera director to stage Berlioz's La damnation de Faust, which was considered at that time so far more as an oratorio than opera, in his theatre on February 18, 1893. Gunsbourg's work in Monte Carlo was briefly interrupted during World War II. Assisted by members of the French Resistance, Gunsbourg fled to nearby Switzerland, escaping arrest and possible execution by the Nazis who occupied Monaco in 1943 and began the deportation of the Jewish population. After the war was over, Gunsbourg returned to Monaco where he continued directing the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo until 1951.

The parish includes the hamlet of Dunthrop. The 2001 Census recorded the parish population as 93. History Heythrop had a Norman parish church of Saint Nicholas, but the nave has been demolished and only the chancel has been preserved as a mortuary chapel. The chapel's west doorway was the south doorway of the former nave. In 1657 an attempt to merge the Benefices of Enstone and Heythrop was abandoned in the face of local opposition. In 1923 the incumbent of Heythrop ceased to live in the parish and in 1964 it and Enstone were finally merged. In 2001 the Benefice of Enstone and Heythrop merged with that of Ascott-under-Wychwood, Chadlington, and Spelsbury to form the Chase Benefice. Heythrop House in Heythrop Park was built from 1706 onwards by the architect Thomas Archer for Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. It was gutted by fire in 1831 and restored to designs by the architect Alfred Waterhouse in 1871 for Albert Brassey. It was a Jesuit college from 1922 until 1969 and a training college for the National Westminster Bank from 1969 until 1999. Brassey rebuilt Heythrop as a model village in the 1870s and 1880s. He encouraged the growth of the church congregation such that it outgrew its Norman building. In 1880 he had a new Church of England parish church of St. Nicholas built by the Gothic Revival architect Sir Arthur Blomfield. The south doorway incorporates 13th century mouldings from the demolished nave of the old church. Albert Brassey had the rectory built at about the same time. It remained in the Brasseys' ownership, and when the incumbent ceased to reside in the parish in 1923 it was renamed the Dower House and let as a private house.

Retrieved on 2011-06-15. Plot The Black Nebula Empire, last seen in Yamato: The New Voyage, lands a huge fortress on Earth and sends out an invasion force, while the Black Nebulan fleet wipes out Earth's space fleets. The fortress contains a bomb capable of destroying half the planet. The Nebulans threaten to use it if they are attacked. The Yamato reaches the other side of the Black Nebula and finds a grand, white galaxy, similar to the Milky Way. They follow a beacon signal to a planet that looks just like Earth. They land, and are greeted by an apparently human woman, Sada, and two officers from the Black Nebulan Empire. They meet the Emperor, Scaldart, who also appears to be a human. He tells them that they are actually back in the Milky Way, in the year 2402. The vortex was a hole in time. The Earth has been under Black Nebulan rule for 200 years, and he is the (puppet) governor. Scaldart shows Kodai and the landing party all sorts of collections of Earth's famous artwork, and, up on the Yamato, the video screen scans the surface of the planet to find all of Earth's famous landmarks. Scaldart shows them a time viewing machine which shows the history of the Yamato from 2199 up until the present. Then he shows them the future. The Yamato, orbiting the Earth, is destroyed by the enemy's flagship, the Grodaze, in 2402. The landing crew returns, demoralized, to the Yamato... except for Sasha who seems to know her true destiny. She abandons the party and remains on conquered Earth. while alone on the surface, her mother Starsha appears in a vision. She tells Sasha that she was born between Iscandar and Earth, and that her destiny is to die far from both, in service of both. Sasha manages to survive the incineration of the surface by escaping to the planet's lower levels. She finds a control center and sends a message to the Yamato, telling them that to destroy Dezarium, they must travel to the core through a huge conduit she is about to open. Scaldart announces after her message that if the Yamato proceeds any further, he will detonate the hyperon bomb on Earth. The blast sets off an explosive chain reaction. The Yamato does a 180-degree turn and rushes out of the internal chamber, going to emergency warp when it reaches the conduit exit. Dezarium explodes behind them, destroying the delicate gravitational balance between the two sides of the Double Galaxy. They crash into each other, commencing the birth of a new galaxy.

The case is now cited for the proposition that commercial speech can be protected by copyright. Facts The named plaintiff was George Bleistein, an employee of the Courier Lithographing Company. The company had been hired by Benjamin Wallace, owner of a traveling circus called the \\"Great Wallace Show\\" (which would later become the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus) to design and produce a number of chromolithographs used to produce posters to promote the circus. The posters featured images from the circus, such as ballet dancers and acrobats.

Donaldson objected on the basis that the posters were merely advertisements, and thus should not be considered eligible for copyright protection either under the Constitution of the United States or under the controlling Copyright Act of 1870. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the posters were not amenable to copyright protection, and Courier appealed.

It was an online collection of structured data harvested from many sources, including individual, user-submitted wiki contributions. Freebase aimed to create a global resource that allowed people (and machines) to access common information more effectively. It was developed by the American software company Metaweb and ran publicly beginning in March 2007. Metaweb was acquired by Google in a private sale announced 16 July 2010. Google's Knowledge Graph was powered in part by Freebase. Freebase data was available for commercial and non-commercial use under a Creative Commons Attribution License, and an open API, RDF endpoint, and a database dump was provided for programmers. On 16 December 2014, Knowledge Graph announced that it would shut down Freebase over the succeeding six months and help with the move of the data from Freebase to Wikidata. On 16 December 2015, Google officially announced the Knowledge Graph API, which is meant to be a replacement to the Freebase API. Freebase.com was officially shut down on 2 May 2016. Both Graphd and MQL, the graph database and JSON-based query language developed by Metaweb for Freebase, have been open-sourced by Google under the Apache 2.0 license, and are available on GitHub. Graphd was open- sourced on September 8, 2018. MQL was open-sourced on August 4, 2020  Overview  On 3 March 2007 Metaweb announced Freebase, describing it as \\"an open shared database of the world's knowledge\\", and \\"a massive, collaboratively edited database of cross-linked data\\". Often understood as a database model using Wikipedia-turned-database or entity-relationship model, Freebase provided an interface that allowed non-programmers to fill in structured data, or metadata, of general information and to categorize or connect data items in meaningful, semantic ways. Described by Tim O'Reilly upon the launch, \\"Freebase is the bridge between the bottom up vision of Web 2.0 collective intelligence and the more structured world of the semantic web\\". Freebase contained data harvested from sources such as Wikipedia, NNDB, Fashion Model Directory and MusicBrainz, as well as data contributed by its users. The structured data was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, and a JSON-based HTTP API was provided to programmers for developing applications on any platform to utilize the Freebase data. The source code for the Metaweb application itself was proprietary. Freebase ran on a database infrastructure created in-house by Metaweb that used a graph model: Instead of using tables and keys to define data structures, Freebase defined its data structure as a set of nodes and a set of links that established relationships between the nodes. Because its data structure was non-hierarchical, Freebase could model much more complex relationships between individual elements than a conventional database, and it was open for users to enter new objects and relationships into the underlying graph. Queries to the database were made in Metaweb Query Language (MQL) and served by a triplestore called graphd.  Development  Danny Hillis Danny Hillis first described his idea for creating a knowledge web he called Aristotle in a paper in 2000, but he said he did not try to build the system until he had recruited technical experts. Veda Hlubinka-Cook, an expert in parallel computing, became Metaweb's Executive Vice President for Product. Kurt Bollacker brought deep expertise in distributed systems, database design, and information retrieval to his role as Chief Scientist at Metaweb. John Giannandrea, formerly Chief Technologist at Tellme Networks and Chief Technologist of the Web browser group at Netscape/AOL, was Chief Technology Officer. Originally accessible by invitation only, Freebase opened full anonymous read access to the public in its alpha stage of development and later required registration only for data contributions. On 29 October 2008, at the International Semantic Web Conference 2008, Freebase released its RDF service for generating RDF representations of Freebase topics, allowing Freebase to be used as linked data.  Organization and policy  Freebase's subjects were called \\"topics\\", and the data stored about them depended on their \\"type\\", as to how they were classified. For example, an entry for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, would be entered as a topic that would include a variety of types describing him as an actor, bodybuilder, and politician. , Freebase had approximately 44 million topics and 2.4 billion facts. Freebase's types were themselves user-editable. Each type had a number of defined predicates, called \\"properties\\". > [U]nlike the W3C approach to the semantic web, which starts with controlled > ontologies, Metaweb adopts a folksonomy approach, in which people can add > new categories (much like tags), in a messy sprawl of potentially > overlapping assertions. However, Freebase differed from the wiki model in many ways. User-created types were not adopted in the \\"public commons\\" until promoted by a Metaweb employee. Also, users could not modify each other's types. The reason Freebase could not open up permissions of schemas is that external applications relied on them; thus, changing a type's schema ‚Äì for instance by deleting a property or changing a simple property ‚Äì might have broken queries for API users and even within Freebase itself, for example in saved views.  Discontinuation  On 16 December 2014, the Freebase team officially announced that the website and the application programming interface would be shut down by 30 June 2015. Google provided an update on 16 December 2015 that they would discontinue the Freebase API and widget 3 months after a Suggest widget replacement was launched in early 2016.

Established in 1965 by Marion Glass, the company operates nine restaurants throughout the greater Dayton area. Marion's son, Roger Glass, took over as CEO after Marion's death in 2006 and continues to manage the company today. The pizzeria produces what it calls \\"Dayton-style pizza\\". In 2017, it was recognized by the trade publication Pizza Today, as the number one independent pizza chain based on sales. Roger Glass, the CEO, noted that the company won the award four of the last five years.  History  The company was founded on August 19, 1965 by Marion Glass. Glass was an owner of three franchises for the larger Dayton-area Cassano's Pizza King chain. Glass said he wanted his own restaurant because he wanted to offer a dining-room experience as opposed to the mostly delivery and carry-out options. His departure from Cassano's came a year after what the Dayton Daily News dubbed the \\"pizza wars\\". A fellow franchisee, Ron Holp, broke off and opened his own restaurant, which led to a lawsuit between Holp and Cassano's, in which Holp was accused of stealing pizza dough from the company. After Holp won the case, Glass asked if he could buy dough for Marion's. While Holp would not sell it, his wife showed Glass how to make the dough.  1965 price promotions  Every 5 years, for one day only, Marion's Piazza sells their traditional menu items at the original 1965 price (e.g., a small cheese pizza for $0.80 and a large deluxe pizza for $2.50).  Kenley Players cast parties  One of the distinct characteristics of every Marion's Piazza location is the photos found on the walls. From 1966 to 1995, the Kenley Players would hold cast parties at Marion's after their summer theatre performances. Today, the walls are filled with black and white photographs of the parties. Many of the photos are autographed by the celebrities. The photographs include celebrities such as Paul Lynde, Desi Arnaz, Jr., Sandy Duncan, Sally Field, McLean Stevenson, Barry Williams, Gary Sandy, Loni Anderson, Robert Goulet, Mickey Rooney, William Shatner, Tim Conway, Morgan Fairchild, Dom DeLuise, Joyce DeWitt, Billy Crystal, Bill Bixby, Karla DeVito, Rip Taylor, and George Hamilton among others. The photos serve as memorial of Marion's tradition in the Dayton area.

It was published in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills (1888), and in subsequent editions of that collection. \\"Thrown Away\\" tells of an unnamed 'Boy', a product of the English \\"sheltered life system\\" that Kipling abhors: > \\"Let a puppy eat the soap in the bath-room or chew a newly-blacked boot. He > chews and chuckles until, by and by, he finds out that blacking and Old > Brown Windsor make him very sick; so he argues that soap and boots are not > wholesome. Any old dog about the house will soon show him the unwisdom of > biting big dogs' ears. Being young, he remembers and goes abroad, at six > months, a well-mannered little beast with a chastened appetite. If he had > been kept away from boots, and soap, and big dogs till he came to the > trinity full-grown and with developed teeth, just consider how fearfully > sick and thrashed he would be! Apply that motion to the \\"sheltered life,\\" > and see how it works.\\" Having been protected from all unpleasantness, the Boy has not been toughened and has not learned \\"the proper proportions of things\\". The Boy is sent to India, not having met his parents' expectations at Sandhurst, and becomes a subaltern in an Indian regiment. \\"This Boy ‚Äî the tale is as old as the hills ‚Äî came out and took all things seriously\\": he quarrels, and remembers disagreements; he gambles; he flirts, and is too serious; he loses money and health; he is reprimanded by his Colonel. When, finally, he is insulted (thoughtlessly) by a woman, he contemplates, and then asks for shooting leave, to go after Big Game where only partridge are to be found. He takes a revolver. A Major (also nameless) who has taken an interest in the Boy returns from his own leave, and fearing the worst presses the narrator to go with him to visit the Boy. (\\"'Can you lie?'\\", the Major asks; \\"'You know best,' I answered. 'It's my profession'\\" says the journalist Kipling, ever self- deprecating.) After a furious drive, they find the Boy dead, by suicide ‚Äî as the Major had feared. They discreetly bury him, concocting a story of cholera. They discover letters that the Boy has written to the Colonel, to the Boy's mother, and to a girl in England. They are moved to tears by reading the letters, but they burn them, and concoct a letter to the Boy's mother, telling the lie about cholera, and others about his great promise etc., which earns her undying gratitude - \\"the obligation she would be under to us as long as she lived.\\" \\"All things considered, she was under an obligation, but not exactly as she meant.\\" The Major reveals the cause of his concern ‚Äî he too had despaired when he was young, and he sympathised with the Boy. The story has keen psychological observations (the conspirators' combined laughter and choking fits as they prepare their lies) and telling narrative detail. For example, although they are tired, the Major and the narrator remember to \\"put away [the Boy's] revolver with the proper amount of cartridges in the pouch\\" in his room. :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

It was written between 1838‚Äì1845 by Swedish minister Lars Levi Laestadius, but was not published until 1997 in Swedish, 2000 in Finnish, and 2002 in English. The book was originally written for the French-funded La Recherche Expedition of 1838‚Äì1840, but was lost and forgotten for many decades thereafter. Laestadius describes the state of Sami religious beliefs held during his time, which had already long been passing into history by the Christianization of the Sami during this period. The condition of these stories is described as \\"fragments\\", as Laestadius himself admitted that there was a great deal of Sami religious beliefs that he knew little about because of the Sami peoples' secrecy concerning their beliefs.L√¶stadius, p. 54 Loss and discovery of the book Laestadius was invited to participate in the La Recherche Expedition (1838‚Äì1840) by the French Navy because he was recognized for his knowledge of botany and the Sami languages, both of which the expedition undertook to study. Laestadius was the field guide for the Norwegian Atlantic islands and in the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying and describing both plant life of the high arctic, and the culture of the Sami people at the time of the expedition. After the expedition, Laestadius was mentioned extensively within the project; however, his Sami chronicle was quickly forgotten as other issues came to the forefront such as Laestadius's personal and moral struggles and his focus on the new Laestadian movement rather than Sami shamanism. Laestadius delayed in sending the complete work of the project rather than piecemealing in single parts, and he personally lacked the money to publish the text himself. The French government also lost interest as there was considerable political instability during the 1840s, ending in the French Revolution of 1848, which finally ended French interest in the whole project and in publication of the Fragments. The results of the entire expedition, excluding the Fragments, were buried in the National archives of France.L√¶stadius, p. 51 Discovery Because of the delay in the French government's receipt of Laestadius's manuscript, it was not published in the expedition's final publication work. The leader of the expedition, Joseph Paul Gaimard, held Laestadius's work in his private collection until his death in 1858. Thereafter, part 1 of the work was sold to a Xavier Marmier of Pontarlier, France, who upon his death in 1892, willed it to the Pontarlier library. There it stayed in the Marmier's un-catalogued collection until it was discovered in 1933. Parts 2‚Äì5 of Fragments were sold, as part of Gaimard's estate, to the local antiquarian bookstores, where they ended up in the personal library of French Count Paul Edouard Didier Riantin. Thereafter, their whereabouts remained unknown until they were discovered in 1946 across the Atlantic Ocean in the manuscript archives of Yale University. In 1959, parts 2‚Äì5 were microfilmed and added to the university's Swedish library.L√¶stadius, p. 48‚Äì52 Fragments of Lappish Mythology ;Contents #Reminder to the Reader #Part 1: Doctrine of Deities #Part 2: Doctrine of Sacrifice #Part 3: Doctrine of Divination #Part 4: Selection of Lappish Tales #Part 5: Addition See also * Norwegianization Notes Citation * Sami deities Sami mythology Sami goddesses Sami gods Sami publications Books about religion 1840s books 1997 non-fiction books ","title":"Fragments of Lappish Mythology"},{"id":"19137627","text":"The Heller Theatre in Tulsa, Oklahoma is the largest community theatre in Oklahoma.

Santa Esperanza can be read in any order, an unusual format for a novel.http://www.signandsight.com/features/1094.html, Sign and Sight, 13/12/2006 Once upon a time in Georgia, Retrieved February 11, 2011. Non-linear format As the entire story is narrated in a particular way, there are certain rules for the reader to follow. Santa Esperanza has neither a cover, nor an ordinary binding. This is a coarse traveler‚Äôs bag full of booklets and a map. Each of 36 booklets has its own number and color (faded brown, yellow, green and blue). They remind of playing cards and invite the reader to play the literary game: read the booklets in different order and you will get either 4 different novels, 9 large stories, 36 short stories or one huge novel. Plot Santa Esperanza is a multi-cultural country stretched on three small islands lost somewhere in the middle of the Black Sea. The islands are inhabited by the Georgians, the Genoese (descendants of the Black Sea settlers), the Turks and the British. The islands are often visited by tourists, who essentially view the place as an earthly Paradise. However, there are occasional tourists who take a closer look at the distinct and singular culture, as well as the traditions turned into taboos. Since the Crimean War, the Island has been under British rule. Apparently, at that time they leased the three islands for 150 years from the last governor Sarri-Beg, a Turk of Georgian origin. The main story of the novel unfolds in 2002, when the British leave the islands and Santa Esperanza gains independence. The rivalry between the local powerful clans grows into a civil war, which has no clear political coloring, it rather is a clash of spiritual monsters reared during the lull of several centuries. For this reason, the war has no obvious cause, and the only tangible conflict is the primacy of the clan to receive the state insignia from the British Governor. The hostilities are instigated by the Visramianis, the wealthiest Georgian clan, owners of one of the islands. The family traditions and internal regulations comprise a sophisticated system of numerous prohibitions and complicated, opinionated restrictions, which eventually causes dramatic developments in the personal lives of the younger generation. One of the central stories is a love relation between Salome Visramiani and Sandro da Costa, the heir of an eminent Genoese family. For nearly twenty years the Visramianis have been fighting the relationship of their girl with the lad brought up on completely different principles and traditions. The Visramianis call themselves ‚Äòthe Preserved‚Äô while looking down on the Genoese, considering them foreigners, and opposing the marriage of the loving couple. The love between Salome and Sandro, which began in school, finishes tragically: in the ensuing chaos, Salome, turned into a drug addict in the turmoil, becomes the head of her family, which eventually brings Sandro, the young poet stranded in the other part of the city torn by the hostilities, to commit suicide. The novel abounds in extracts from his diary and unsent letters, telling their adventures from childhood to the war onset. Another narrative line of the novel describes the life of Data, the prodigal son of the Visramiani clan. He is obsessed with playing cards, an ungainly and unacceptable pastime for the millionaire‚Äôs family. Data‚Äôs appearance on the pages uncovers yet another layer in the traditions and cultural life of Santa Esperanza, related to a popular local card game Intee (‚Äòrun‚Äô). The 36 booklets of the novel are designed following the Intee structure and their titles represent individual cards. The game is absolutely dissimilar to any other known card game, as it presupposes its own rules combined with no less complicated regulations reflecting life itself. The other local tradition that Data is tightly linked to is the singing: a unique kind of folk song, the Blue Song, only performed by women. Due to their proverbial passion, they were prescribed to hide their faces behind veils. Even nowadays, as a result of the ancient custom, the women remain faceless and nameless singing in clubs with restricted access. The emergence of the Blue Songs was rather strange too: a woman would sit at the waterfront, accompanying the waves with her wordless, but deeply emotional singing. Data is infatuated by Kesane, one of the singers. She also falls victim to the civil war: captured by the guardsmen, she jumps from the Citadel keep. Data, together with Panteleimon, an Orthodox monk, his only and the most loyal friend, flee the turmoil in a boat, not knowing whether they are going to ever reach any coast. The Eastern Orthodox Monastery is the oldest stone building of the island. It was here that the monks used to write the local history, preserving and unveiling the past in their chronicles. One of the main metaphors of the novel is a pair of windows. One is in the Monastery, through which a monk first observed a strangely grieving woman singing her Blue Song on the beach many years ago. The other is in the Citadel (which housed the museum during the British rule) from which Kesane, the bluemarina, jumped. These two windows have been facing each other for centuries over the old Slave Market Square, used for exactly that purpose in the Middle Ages. One can get an absolutely stunning view of Santa City from these windows. It is through the Monastery window that an old-fashioned arrow finds its prey, Nick, a mobster seeking refuge on Santa Esperanza. He fled Georgia only to find himself involved in the islanders‚Äô entangled relationships. The Visramianis force him to marry Salome, but a mysterious intrigue and a constant necessity to hide, make him an irreconcilable opponent of his new family. There are 25 active characters in the novel. Among them are three British intelligence agents trying to ensure a peaceful transition of power. The British political priority is a formal hand-over of the island to the direct descendant of Sarri-Beg, the last governor. This happens to be an old woman known as Queen Agatha, who lives alone in considerable poverty in her small cottage. Nick, the Georgian mobster, and Parna the Standard Bearer, a professional gambler and Data‚Äôs friend, are among her courtiers, who share a tragic end with their Sovereign. Another line of the plot is the story of the Sungalis, who make up the fighting force of the opposing sides. This ethnic group, inhabiting one of the three islands, has its own century-old insular traditions and customs, demonstrating unwillingness to mingle and inter-marry the multi-cultural population of the main island. Seven or eight centuries ago, having decided to safeguard them, one of the Georgian kings asked the then governor of Santa Esperanza to take these people under his protection. (It was not uncommon for the Georgian rulers of the olden days to hide entire villages from the Mongol tax-collectors.) The Sungalis are illiterate peasants with a militant spirit, who strictly follow their archaic traditions and live in small communities on their island, where everyone is everyone else‚Äôs relative. In the tourist attraction areas they work as guards in cafes, restaurants, clubs and hotels. These goblin-like people are extremely open-hearted and ingenuous, though fighting and warfare is in their blood. With the Esperanza clans it is an old tradition to take them as servants, guards and bailiffs. As a result, every clan has a formidable host of the Sungalis at its disposal. The Sungalis have their own hereditary priests, but they don‚Äôt liaise with any official church. These people stranded in the history have two leaders: a retired bailiff Khetia, who keeps a country guest-house, and Martia, the head of the Visramiani security. The friendship and enmity of the two men with complex characters determine much in the narrative. Sly and crafty Khetia leads the rebellion. He is the one behind the entire intrigue, which eventually threw the country into the civil war. Resisting the whole idea of the war with all his heart, Martia nevertheless finds himself deeply involved in it, which finally leads to his death. Martia is hopelessly in love with Salome, also adored by a former sailor Luka, who is the author of a once best-seller. Luka‚Äôs character seems to have travelled from an old-fashioned novel. Despite numerous hardships, he radiates kindness and cheerfulness, his unbelievable stories and adventures entertain everyone around him. Luka‚Äôs line is entwined with that of his ex-wife, Jessica de Rider, the author of popular romances. One of the characters is Lamour the Walker, the representative of an old local trade: in the pre-newspaper times, his ancestors used to make a living by passing the news across and between the islands. But he manages to combine his hereditary trade with the job of a private eye, which enables him to sell gossip in a most cynical manner. Another character is Monica Uso di Mare, a journalist desperately in love with Sandro da Costa. She is the reason of unhappiness of an English writer Edmond Clever, who is famous for his several books featuring Santa Esperanza. One of his books is In Search of the Lost Pipe dedicated to yet another local myth: governor Ali-Bey had a pipe of such length that its end rested on the other island and seagulls were perched on it. Several pieces of the legendary pipe are truly sacred for a lot of islanders. One of them is Morad-Bey, a coffee-shop owner, trying to collect all the pieces in order to put them together. Rummaging through Queen Agatha‚Äôs possessions, Alfredo da Costa, the Museum Director, comes across a sack full of the pipe pieces. Three British agents assemble them only to find that Ali- Bey‚Äôs pipe was actually much shorter than it was believed. Alfredo da Costa, Sandro‚Äôs uncle and the sole survivor of the family, sets to work on the family history in the post-war Santa City. Just before the hostilities began, austere and mighty patriarch Constantine Visramiani died of haemorrhage. On his deathbed he clearly realised where his ambition had brought the entire country, but was unable to say anything due to serious brain damage. However, he managed to scribble the word ‚Äòrun‚Äô on the blanket for his grandson Data to see. Data and Salome‚Äôs mother Kaya becomes a hostage of her own clan. Salome succeeds in putting an end to the hostilities, but the flourishing Santa Esperanza of the British period is razed to the ground. The main characters are dead. The culture and traditions reigning the small country throughout the centuries lie waste. The book finishes with the dramatic events unfolding on the Sungali Island, as it is attacked by the peace-keeping forces from three sides.

A turboprop powered single-engined monoplane, it was built in small numbers and used both as a cropsprayer and a firefighting aircraft. Development and design NDN Aircraft, which was set up in 1976 by Desmond Norman, one of the founders of Britten-Norman, the manufacturers of the Islander, to build the Firecracker trainer, designed a new agricultural aircraft. The resulting aircraft, the NDN-6 Fieldmaster was a large single-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprop engine, the first western-built agricultural aircraft to be designed for turboprop power. Novel features included an integral hopper made of Titanium to carry its chemical payload, which was dispersed via spray nozzles built into the flaps under the aircraft's wings. The first prototype flew on 17 December 1981 at NDN's airfield at Sandown, Isle of Wight. TNDN moved the premises to Cardiff, Wales in 1985, renaming itself the Norman Aeroplane Company (NAC). Production finally started in 1987. It was intended that parts would be produced by UTVA in Panƒçevo, Yugoslavia (now in Serbia) to be assembled in Cardiff. NAC went into receivership in 1988, after the production of six Fieldmasters, including the prototype. Brooklands Aerospace attempted to continue production, rebuilding one of the Fieldmasters with a more powerful engine as a specialised firefighting aircraft as the Firemaster 65, but these attempts were stopped by the outbreak of civil war in Yugoslavia. A final attempt at production was made by the Turkish Aeronautical Association (T√ºrk Hava Kurumu ‚Äì THK) who started licensed production in 1997.
