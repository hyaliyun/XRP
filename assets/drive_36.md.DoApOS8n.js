The species is solely known from the Latest Paleocene sediments exposed in the Matanuska River Valley, Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska. It is the type species for the extinct section Alaskana. Type locality The species was described from a single full-leaf specimen found in the Chickaloon Formation, which underlies the Kenai Group formations. Sediments of the formation are mainly claystone through sandstone, and conglomerates with interbedded deposits of bituminous coal. Based on the surrounding formations and the floral composition of fossils in the formation itself, the Chickaloon dates to the Paleocene with Acer alaskense known only from the latest Paleocene section exposed in the Even Jones coal mine. History and classification Acer alaskense was described from a solitary specimen, the holotype (number \\"USNM 396009\\"), which is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. alaskense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name alaskense is in recognition of the type locality in the state of Alaska. A. alaskense is the oldest occurrence of the maple genus, Acer, with the second-oldest being A. douglasense from the Early Eocene sediments of the Paleocene-Eocene West Foreland Formation. In their type description Wolfe and Tanai designated A. alaskense as the type and only species for the extinct Acer section Alaskana. Description Leaves of Acer alaskense are simple in structure and generally oval in shape. The leaves are three- to possibly only two-lobed, with the fossil showing a blade with one lateral lobe. The leaf is wide and long in overall dimension. A. alaskense has a simple structure to the tertiary veins that connect the basal secondary veins, which is not seen in other species of Acer. However the numerous teeth and structure of the areolar venation are very similar to the modern species A. spicatum. Wolfe and Tanai note that the apparent two-lobed structure may be an aberration and A. alaskense may have typically been three-lobed.

Description The subject is Empress Isabella of Portugal (1503–1539), the beloved second wife of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, mother of Philip II of Spain and daughter of Manuel I of Portugal. Titian painted her after her death, using a mediocre painting for reference.Tiziano Vecellio, Charles Hope, Jennifer Fletcher, Jill Dunkerton, Miguel Falomir Faus, Nicholas Penny, Caroline Campbell, Amanda Bradley, and David Jaffe. 2003. Titian: [National Gallery, London 19 February - 18 May 2003]. London: National Gallery. p. 36. . For the rest of his life, Charles took the painting with him on all his travels. The portrait follows a classic scheme already used by Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, in which the model sits next to a window opening on a landscape. The landscape gives depth to the composition, and its greenish and bluish tones provide a contrast to the interior scene dominated by warm colors. The figure shows some stiffness, possibly related to the concept of majesty as used in imperial iconography. She wears a rich red dress and gold brocade and trimmed with rhinestones. It is decorated also with flashy jewelry: a necklace of pearls with a clasp at the chest with gems hanging from another teardrop pearl, a ring on her right hand, and a jewel-topped headdress. Her rigid hairstyle, very fashionable at the time, is made up with braids. The Empress holds an open book in her left hand, perhaps a missal or prayer book, and looks at a distant point with preoccupied expression.

IbpA is regulated by a ROSE element found in its 5' UTR, while IbpB has its own heat-sensitive cis-regulatory element.

The book was released on 27 February 2013, through Westland Press and completes the mythical story about an imaginary land Meluha and how its inhabitants were saved by a nomad named Shiva. Starting from where the previous installment left off, Shiva discovers what is the true evil in The Oath of the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares a holy war on those who seek to continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments. Tripathi had confirmed in September 2011 that he was writing The Oath of the Vayuputras, with Westland announcing the release date as 27 February 2013. The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends left out in the previous book would be addressed, with the death of certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the publication rights of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series. After its release, The Oath of the Vayuputras received positive reviews for the story and characterisation with Business Standard calling Tripathi 'India's Tolkien'. However, his continued insistence on using modern, easy English gave way to a negative review by Mint. The book was a commercial success with 350,000 copies for pre-order, and an initial print-run of 500,000 copies. On the first day of the release itself, the book sold the initial print-run breaking the record for the fastest selling book in India. This prompted Westland to pay Tripathi an advance amount of for Tripathi's next book series. As of June 2015 over 2.5 million copies of the Shiva Trilogy have been sold with gross retail sales of over , making it the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing. Plot synopsis On meeting Brahaspati at the Naga capital of Panchavati, Shiva comes to know about the evil \\"Somras\\", and its ill effects on the people of India. Brahaspati explains that the large amounts of water required to manufacture Somras has resulted in the depletion of the Saraswati River's water. The waste generated in the process of manufacturing the Somras was dumped in the Tsangpo river, which flows through Branga territory as Brahmaputra, and resulted in their disastrous plague. Also the birth of Naga babies was credited to Somras as it results in the multiplication of cells at a very high rate which lead to their deformation and outgrowths. Shiva travels to the hidden city of Ujjain along with his entourage to meet the chief of Vasudev pandits, Gopal. He explains how the Vayuputra council—an ancient tribe left by the previous Mahadev Lord Rudra, dwelling in remote land of Pariha in the West—train a member of their tribe as the Neelkanth when \\"evil\\" rises. Shiva comes to the conclusion that it was his uncle Manobhu, who turns out to be a former Vayuputra member, trained him as Neelkanth. Seeing that Meluha is the center of manufacturing the Somras, Shiva declares a holy war on the Kingdom and appeals the people to stop using the drink. Parvateshwar decides to join Meluha, since he thinks that it is his duty to defend his motherland; Anandamayi joins him. Shiva also realizes that Maharishi Bhrigu is the mastermind behind the attack on Panchavati, plotting against him along with the Swadweepan emperor Dilipa and Daksha. The preparation for the war mobilizes as Branga, Vaishali and Kashi come to Shiva's aid. He takes the Nagas, the Brangas and the Vasudev elephant corps to attack Meluha, while Kartik and Ganesh attack Ayodhya and successfully prevent them from aiding Meluha. Shiva captures the city of Mrittikavatti and makes the citizens imprison the Meluhan army led by Vidyunmali, who believes Shiva to be a fraud. He escapes and persuades Bhrigu and Parvateshwar to attack Sati's army by a thousand Meluhan troops, and defeat them. Following this defeat, Shiva abandons the plan of invading Meluha and leave for Pariha with Gopal; they wanted to procure the deadly Brahmastra weapon, to threaten the Meluhans for peace with them. There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who turns out to be his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali that he was going to attack Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns. Daksha plans to assassinate Shiva and sends Vidyunmali to get Egyptian assassins. He frames a peace treaty for Shiva but in his absence, Sati attends the peace conference and finds out the truth. She fights the assassins valiantly, but is killed. The war ends with Sati's death, but an enraged Shiva decides to use the Pashupatiastra to finish Devagiri forever. Parvateshwar, Anandmayi, Veerini decide to stay back in the city and die with it, but Kartik persuades Bhrigu to remain alive and share his vast knowledge with future generations. Shiva unleashes the astra and ends Devagiri's history, along with the Somras manufacturing units hidden beneath the city. In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash where he lives the rest of his days peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping out the whole clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu continues teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti. It is revealed that in order to ensure that the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River. Characters and locations Tripathi believes that \\"Myths are nothing but jumbled memories of a true past.

Characters and locations adapted as per the books from the series and from the official website. Development and release Tripathi had initially decided to write a book on philosophy, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he wrote a book on Shiva, one of the Hindu gods. The story was of how a Tibetan tribal chief called Shiva became the fabled savior of the land of Meluha. His adventures nearly 4000 years ago, morphed into the mythical legends of the Hindu God Shiva. Titled The Immortals of Meluha, the book went on to become a huge commercial success, after its release in February 2010, with film director Karan Johar's Dharma Productions purchasing the film rights of the book. The success prompted Tripathi to pen a second part of the trilogy, titled The Secret of the Nagas. Following what happens in the life of Shiva, the plotline and the geography of the story was expanded to venture into unknown territories. Tripathi quit his job as a banker while writing the book, dedicating his whole time to the marketing and the promotion of the release. The Secret of the Nagas was also a commercial success, with both the books having crossed a print run of a million copies. These books have continued to top the bestseller lists of Nielsen BookScan, with the gross retail sales being impressive at within two years of publishing. Book cover release party for The Oath of the Vayuputras. From left: Gautam Padmanabhan, CEO of Westland Books, filmmaker Karan Johar, author Amish Tripathi and cover artist Rashmi Pusalkar. In September 2011, Tripathi confirmed that from the next month he would start penning the third installment of the trilogy, The Oath of the Vayuputras. In January 2013, it was revealed that The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that the final version of the book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53 chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. \\"Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go quietly into the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, people will die in Vayuputras,\\" he concluded. Explaining that he wrote it as per his whim, and not according to the need to have more philosophy or love or war, Tripathi was sure that The Oath of the Vayuputras would have a tragic ending. During an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Tripathi explained that he had purposefully used the modern terms for the different historical locations described in the book, including calling India by its name, rather than its ancient name, Jambudweep. He did not believe that India could be represented as a political concept in his book, since at the timeline followed in the Shiva trilogy, India was still a cultural concept. Since some of the characters have their mythological names, but do not follow the characteristic traits, Tripathi believed that such development was spontaneous and did not question his writing further. Giving an example, the author said: \\"When I was writing the first book, I was struggling with the Naga, because I wanted to desperately change his character – that he should be jovial and happy. But he kept ending up as a tormented and troubled a guy who was suffering. And I just had to surrender\\" The cover art of the book was launched in Mumbai, by Tripathi and Johar in a ceremony, which also saw the presence of Gautam Padmanabhan, CEO of Westland Publishers, and Rashmi Pusalkar, the designer of the cover of The Oath of the Vayuputras. The author added that Pusalkar had managed to merge in many of the symbolic elements represented in the storyline of the book, while maintaining the same visual appeal of the previous releases of the trilogy. He wanted the cover to have a symbolic meaning, portraying Shiva wielding Pinaka—the legendary bow of the God according to Mythology—and a burning bush behind him. The increasing brightness of the book covers signified the triumph of good over evil, according to Tripathi. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Oath of the Vayuputras was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and the author's Indian agent, Anuj Bahri of Red Ink Literary Agency. The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released in the United States in summer 2014. The Oath of the Vayuputras was released in six different languages, namely English (South Asia), English (UK), Hindi, Telugu, Gujarati and Marathi. Marketing techniques Since both The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas had innovative marketing techniques, Tripathi spoke about similar innovativeness with the release of The Oath of the Vayuputras. One of the marketing strategies included a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy. The idea for the album came from Sangram Surve, CEO of Tripathi's advertisement agency, Think WhyNot. The album had nine songs dedicated to Lord Shiva with several Bollywood singers lending their voices, and was inspired by the different sections and storyline in the books. Titled \\"Jo Vayuputra Ho\\" (\\"One Who is a Vayuputra\\"), the lead song was composed by musician Taufiq Qureshi and recorded by singer Sonu Nigam. A music video was also developed by Think WhyNot team, directed by Amit Pandirkar and music by Rajeev Sharma. The video was broadcast in popular television channels and across all social media platforms. The concept of the music video was the journey of the three books of the Shiva Trilogy in its five-minute span. Other marketing strategies included launching interactive apps, merchandise and events that would follow the music and book launch. In an interview with Business Standard, Surve explained: > \\"After tasting the stupendous marketing success of, The Secrets of the > Nagas, we are very excited to partner with Amish for the launch of The Oath > of the Vayuputras. The 'think big' brief given to us was apt for the launch > of the final book ... The challenge was to not just get existing fans of the > franchise to buy The Oath of Vayuputras—that would happen anyway—but to > expand the reader base. The campaign idea revolved around creating another > 'first-of-its-kind' in book marketing, which this time around turned out to > be the production of a world-class music video which is poised at reaching > out to the masses through television, in a bid to garner greater awareness > about the book.\\" Critical response The book received mixed to positive responses from critics. R Krishna from Daily News and Analysis gave a positive review for the book. He observed that the criticism in the second book regarding bad editing and writing has been polished in The Oath of the Vayuputras. He complimented the fact that philosophical discussions in the book is rightly balanced by action sequences, commending the way in which Sati's fight with the assassins is described. Krishna concluded that the different characters of the book make it a good reading and a fitting ending to the series. Phorum Dalal from Mid Day praised the urban dialect used by Shiva in the book and felt that Tripathi's grip on the whole story is steady and has the reader's undivided attention, ultimately \\"giving the Trilogy an end it deserves\\". Sanjeev Sanyal from Business Standard gave a neutral review saying that although the fast- paced and easy style from the earlier books has been retained, it is evident if one goes back and rereads the first few pages of The Immortals of Meluha that Tripathi has become much more comfortable and confident of his writing. \\"Of course, those whose literary tastes have not outgrown Wren and Martin will still find fault with his use of the English language. For the rest of us, it is delightful to see how Tripathi applies simple language to evoke great battle scenes and extraordinary landscapes\\". Aadisht Khanna from Mint was disappointed with the book and gave a negative review. According to him poor grammar and bad editing of the book marred the possibility of The Oath of the Vayuputras becoming a classic. Adding that the scope of imagination was vast and ambitious, Khanna explained that he \\"really wanted to like this book. But the laziness in editing and rewriting is evident, and unforgivable ... It seems as though Westland Ltd, knowing that it has a guaranteed best-seller on its hands, has decided to be as lazy as possible when it comes to the actual editing.\\" The Kolkata Statesmans Mrityunjay Khurana gave a positive review to the book, saying \\"Amish has skillfully used Upanishadic, Puranic, Zoroastrian and Buddhist mythological images and their essence in lucid and contemporary language.\\" The review goes on to say that Tripathi had tried to bring out knowledge from the dogma-box approach and that despite the author's much criticized \\"clunky language and sloppy grammar\\", the tale reached its goal of attraction the attention towards Mythology and traditions, along with inspiring readers. Commercial response According to Zee News, before its official release The Oath of the Vayuputras had about 350,000 copies for pre- order, with an initial print-run of 500,000 copies. On the first day of the release itself, the book sold the initial print-run breaking the record for the fastest selling book in India. This prompted Westland to pay Tripathi an advance amount of for the next series that he would pen, even though Tripathi confessed that he did not have any idea regarding the subject that he would pursue for his next endeavor. Padmanabhan clarified that the advance included the book, audio and e-publishing rights for Tripathi's next series, and was only for the South-Asian region and \\"It's the largest advance we've ever paid, and the largest Indian deal\\". Anuj Bahri, who was the first publisher for The Immortals of Meluha, said that the deal could go up to US$4 million once they acquire the film, foreign and translation rights for the books. As of June 2015 over 2.5 million copies of the Shiva Trilogy have been sold with gross retail sales of over , making it the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing.

Negley House) located at 5061 Fifth Avenue in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was built from 1870 to 1871 for William B. Negley (June 5, 1828 – January 16, 1894, a lawyer who attended Princeton University, served as a Major in the American Civil War under General James S. Negley, and was the son of Jacob Negley and the nephew of Sarah Negley and Thomas Mellon). After Joanna Wilmerding (Bruce) Negley, the widow of William B. Negley, died in 1910, Edward Gwinner, a stone and railroad contractor, purchased the property in 1911. Gwinner had it remodeled and expanded. The original architect is unknown, but Frederick J. Osterling remodeled the house and was responsible for additions between 1912 and 1923. Gwinner died in 1949, and his widow, Adele, owned it until 1963, when the house was sold to Dr. Leo Harter. In 1987, a fire caused by a paint-stripping gun during renovation burned much of the third floor and damaged the roof. Harter died in 1988, and the house sat vacant for eight years, was boarded up, and had even been considered for demolition. Then in 1995, restoration contractor Joedda Sampson and her husband Ben, a builder and developer, purchased the property and restored it. The restoration took nine months.

He was the poetic link between the Renaissance and the Counter-Reformation in the Netherlands.  Life  De Harduwijn was born in a humanist, intellectual family in Ghent. His grandfather Thomas was a steward to Louis of Praet. His father Franciscus owned a bookbinding shop in Ghent and was a member of the Council of Flanders, the highest judicial college in the County of Flanders. His father was a friend of writer Jan van der Noot who had introduced him to the French poets of La Pléiade, and is said to have been the first translator of Anacreon into Dutch. Justus' uncle, Dionysius de Harduwijn, was a historian, and Justus inherited his rich library. The humanist poet Maximiliaan de Vriendt was another uncle of his, and he was also related to Daniel Heinsius. De Harduwijn studied at the Jesuit college which had recently been established in Ghent. Around 1600 he went to the University of Leuven where he studied under Justus Lipsius and in 1605 became a Bachelor in Law. Subsequently, he studied theology at the seminary of Douai. In April 1607 De Harduwijn was ordained a priest, and in December of the same year he became the parish priest of Oudegem and Mespelare, functions which he occupied until his death in Oudegem in 1636.  Work  Frontispice of Goddelijcke Wenschen (1629) Justus de Harduwijn became a member of the chamber of rhetoric of Aalst. As a student, he composed the love sonnets De weerliicke liefde tot Roosemond, influenced by the poets of the Pléiade; it was the first book of sonnets written entirely in Dutch, as earlier humanists had written in Latin. It was published anonymously in 1613 by Verdussen in Antwerp, with the poet Guilliam Caudron as the editor. Influenced by Henricus Calenus and Jacobus Boonen, who would become his patron, De Harduwijn found his inspiration in divine contemplations. In 1614 he wrote Lof-Sanck des Heylich Cruys (Paean to the Holy Cross), a translation of a work by Calenus. In Goddelicke Lofsanghen (Divine Songs of Praise, 1620), dedicated to Boonen, a number of earlier profane poems were reworked. The same year the biblical poetry of Den val en de Opstand van David/Leed-tuyghende Pasalmen (David's fall and rise / Penitential Psalms) was published as well. His most important work of poetry, Goddelijcke Wenschen (Divine Wishes), appeared in 1629. It was a complete adaptation of the Herman Hugo's Pia desideria (1624). In 1630 Cornelius Jansen, who had just been promoted to professor in Leuven, called upon de Harduwijnto translate the Counter- Reformation pamphlet Alexipharmacum into Dutch. In 1635 de Harduwijn, together with David Lindanus, wrote Goeden Yever tot het Vaderland ter blijde inkomste van den Coninclijcken Prince Ferdinand van Oostenryck (Good Zeal for the Fatherland on the joyous entry of the Royal Prince Ferdinance of Austria), celebrating the Joyous Entry of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria as Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands.  Influence  During his life, de Harduwijn was one of the most widely read poets of the Netherlands. He was largely forgotten after his death but was rediscovered in the 19th century by Jan Frans Willems and the writer Johannes M. Schrant. During the 20th century, Oscar Dambre, a literary historian from Ghent, devoted several studies to de Harduwijn, and composer Arthur Meulemans put his text Clachte van Maria benevens het Kruis (Mary's lament by the cross) to music. There are streets name after him in Ghent and in Sittard-Geleen.

Venus with an Organist and a Dog and so forth. Most versions have a man playing a small organ on the left, but in others a lute is being played. Venus has a small companion on her pillows, sometimes a Cupid and in other versions a dog, or in Berlin both.Loh, 42 The paintings are thought to date from the late 1540s onwards. Many of Titian's paintings exist in several versions, especially his nude mythological subjects. Later versions tend to be mostly or entirely by his workshop, with the degree of Titian's personal contribution uncertain and the subject of differing views. All the versions of the Venus and Musician are in oil on canvas, and fall into two proportions and sizes, with two of the organist versions wider.Falomir, 61–68, and Loh throughout are both analyses of Titian's \\"replicas and variants\\"; Christiansen The five versions generally regarded as at least largely by Titian are, with an organist, the two in Madrid and one in Berlin, and with a lutenist those in Cambridge and New York.Prado; Christiansen Another version in the Uffizi in Florence is less highly regarded, and has no musician, but a Cupid, as well as a black and white dog at the foot of the bed, eyeing a partridge on the parapet.Christiansen In all the versions Venus' bed appears to be set in a loggia or against a large open window with a low stone wall or parapet. Venus is shown at full-length, reclining on pillows. The musician sits on the end of the bed with his back to her, but is turned round to look towards her. By contrast she looks away to the right. He wears contemporary 16th-century dress, as do any small figures in the landscape backgrounds, and has a sword or dagger at his belt. A large red drape takes up the top left corner, and the top right corner in the less wide versions. There is a wide landscape outside, falling into two types. The two Prado versions show avenues of trees and a fountain in what seems to be the gardens of a palace. The other versions have a more open landscape, leading to distant mountains.Loh, 40–42; McIver, 14–17 Titian's reclining nudes Titian's Venus of Urbino, c. 1534, Uffizi, largely the same pose in reverse Venus and Cupid with Dog and Partridge, mostly Titian's workshop, c. 1555, Uffizi The painting is the final development of Titian's compositions with a reclining female nude in the Venetian style. After Giorgione's death in 1510 Titian had completed his Dresden Venus, and then around 1534 had painted the Venus of Urbino. A repetition of this from 1545, perhaps a lost recorded Venus sent to Charles V, \\"was the basis\\" for the Venus and Musician series.Falomir, 61–62 Unlike these, the Cupid in most versions of Venus and Musician does allow a clear identification of the female as Venus, despite the modern decor.Bull, 210-211; Falomir, 67. Bull points out that the Dresden Venus originally had a Cupid. Otherwise the painting falls into the category showing courtesans, though these are also often described as \\"Venus\\", if only to retain some propriety. In all an unembarrassed Venus is completely naked, except for a gauzy cloth over her crotch in some versions, but wears several pieces of very expensive jewellery,McIver, 14 typical aspects of courtesan pictures.Hollander, 314-21, for two views on \\"courtesan\\" pictures; Bull, 210-211 The musician is smartly dressed, and carries a blade weapon, in several versions a large sword with gilded fittings. He could be taken as the client of an expensive Venetian courtesan. Other reclining nudes are the Pardo Venus (or Jupiter and Antiope, now in the Louvre), \\"that laboured attempt to recapture his early style\\",Clark, 121 from the mid-1540s. A more original composition and physique, also begun in the mid-1540s, but with versions painted in the 1550s and perhaps 1560s, is used in the series of Danaë paintings, which Kenneth Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; \\"in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable\\".Clark, 122–123, 122 quoted For Clark, the Venus of the Venus and Musician versions, where the head changes direction but the body remains exactly the same, is \\"entirely Venetian, younger sister of all those expensive ladies whom Palma Vecchio, Paris Bordone and Bonifazio painted for local consumption.\\"Clark, 122 The nude figures are \\"rich, heavy and a trifle coarse ... the Venuses of this series are not provocative. The almost brutal directness with which their bodies are presented to us makes them, now that their delicate texture has been removed by restoration, singularly un- aphrodisiac. Moreover, they are far more conventionalized than is evident at first sight.\\"Clark, 122–123 Allegory? The erotic appeal of the subject is evident, but some critics have argued for a more allegorical meaning to do with the appreciation of beauty through both the eyes and ears, and the superiority of the former.Falomir, 189–190, note 30, summarizes the \\"passionate debate\\", as does Christiansen; Prado Whereas the two Prado organists still seem to be playing, with one hand on the keyboard in the first version, and two in the second, the Berlin organist has abandoned playing to gaze at Venus, a point given great significance by Erwin Panofsky, as representing the \\"triumph of the sense of sight over the sense of hearing\\".McIver, 13–20; Panofsky quoted in Yearsley The depiction of the organs has been criticized by organ scholars: \\"The pipes are too squat, and if they sounded at all would produce a tubby, inelegant wallowing\\".Yearsley The lutenists are able to turn their instruments along with their body, and both seem to continue playing. According to Panofsky, this \\"means that a musician interrupted in the act of making music by the sight of visual beauty embodied in Venus has been transformed into a musician doing homage to the visual beauty embodied in Venus by the very act of making music. It is difficult to play the organ and to admire a beautiful woman at the same time; but it is easy to serenade her, as it were, to the accompaniment of a lute, while giving full attention to her charms.\\"McIver, 13–20; Panofsky quoted in Yearsley The 20th-century fashion for explaining paintings with reference to the subtle doctrines of Renaissance Neoplatonism reached the series, although in the case of Titian there is even more resistance than usual to such explanations. Edgar Wind noted a pictorial convention, seen also in the Pastoral Concert and other works, where divine figures are nude, but mortals clothed. In the Musician paintings \\"the disparity between mortal and goddess is heightened by a paradox of posture. While the courtier plays music under the inspiration of love ... he does not face the goddess directly, but turns his head over his shoulder to look back at her; he thus enacts the Platonic ἐπιστροφἠ, the reversal of vision by which alone a mortal can hope to face transcendent Beauty\\".Wind, 143 note 7. Typically for this territory, Wind notes and dismisses an alternative Neoplatonic interpretation by Otto Brendel. Nonetheless, Wind later describes the composition as \\"a somewhat tiresome show-piece\\".Wind, 273 Although there is no inevitable contradiction between an allegorical interpretation and a more straightforward decorative and erotic one, more recent scholars have often rejected or at least played down the allegorical interpretation. Ulrich Middeldorf, in 1947, began the reaction: \\"The main figures in Titian's Sacred and Profane Love (Galleria Borghese, Rome) possess a dignity and purity that make any high-flung interpretation of the picture seem acceptable. It is quite a unique picture, which we can well imagine as painted to suit the elevated tastes of an extremely refined person. The character of Titian's later Venuses and Danaes, however, seems to place them on an infinitely lower level. They are beautiful, but vulgar in comparison to the Sacred and Profane Love. Also the fact that they were produced in an extraordinary number of replicas does not encourage an attempt to look in them for purity of thought . . . . In brief, the suspicion can hardly be avoided that these pictures were rather 'ornamental furniture' than profound philosophical treatises. And the rooms which they . . . were supposed to decorate, were bedrooms.\\"Quoted by Christiansen. Wind's comments quoted above come from a chapter mainly concerned with his \\"high-flung interpretation\\" of the Sacred and Profane Love The Prado's two versions The Prado's second version, with a cupid, c. 1555 The earliest record of a version of the composition is one with an organist known to have been painted for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor when Titian was in Augsburg in 1548, which the emperor then gave to his minister, Cardinal Granvelle. But it is not certain which this is, though both versions in the Museo del Prado in Madrid have been asserted to be it, especially the Venus with an Organist and Dog, the wider of the two (148 x 217 cm; this is Prado 420). This is now thought by the Prado to date to about 1550,Falomir, 64–65 so ruling it out of being the original Cardinal Granvelle picture, which was the usual opinion until the Prado revised its date recently.See eg Brotton, 236 or Loh, 40, who predate this revision. But in 1996 the Prado catalogue cited re Prado 421, the other version, thought that was Granvelle's painting. It has a dog and is the only version discussed here with no Cupid. Following the Prado's redating, the version given by Charles V to Granvelle is regarded as missing, and presumed lost.Christiansen Although lacking Venus' attribute of Cupid, the painting is always recorded as showing the goddess. Unlike other versions, it is thought that the painting may celebrate a marriage. The woman wears a wedding ring and has none of the traditional attributes of Venus. Compared to other Venuses by Titian, she is not accompanied by a Cupid and \\"it is the only one in which both figures have individualised features\\".Falomir, 66–67; Prado, quoted; McIver, 18–19 Radiography reveals that Titian made alterations during the painting's execution. Originally the work was more daring; Venus lay uninhibitedly with her gaze fixed on the musician, which none of the versions discussed here have. Probably the client or the artist thought that the arrangement was too provocative, so Venus' head was turned, and a lap dog added to give her something to look at, and also touch, so reinforcing any allegory of the senses that might be intended. Venus is now given a more passive role.Prado; McIver, 16 It belonged to a lawyer called Francesco Assonica, who was used professionally by Titian and is mentioned as a friend of the artist, and had other Titians.Penny, 93 Possibly it was painted for him. It remained in Venice until the 1620s, and was sketched there by Anthony van Dyck, and probably in connection with him acquired for the collection of Charles I of England. After his execution it was bought for £165 by Colonel John Hutchinson at the sale of Charles' art in 1649. The same day Hutchinson paid £600 for Titian's Pardo Venus, or Jupiter and Antiope. In 1651/52 it was bought for £600 by David Teniers the Younger as agent for the Habsburgs, and sent to Madrid for the Spanish royal collection, where it remained before the collection was transferred to the Prado.Brotton, 236, 270 Prado A number of copies were made during the painting's time in England, and the Royal Collection had one by the time of Charles II of England, which is possibly the good copy they still have.Venus with an Organist, \\"after Titian, c.1550-1660\\", Royal Collection page The Prado's other version, Venus with an Organist and Cupid, (148 x 217 cm, Prado 421, signed \\"TITIANUS F.\\") with a Cupid rather than a dog, has been thought by some to date from 1547–48, but they currently date it to c. 1555. Miguel Falomir says that recent x-ray and infra-red reflectography make it clear that this was traced from the other Prado version (though they were not re-united again in the Spanish royal collection for over a century). Titian and his studio often used tracing of the main elements to make replica versions.Falomir, 64–66 This too used to be thought to be Charles V and Granvelle's version from 1648, which the current dating would rule out, if correct. It has been in the Spanish royal collection since at least 1626, when Cassiano del Pozzo recorded it in Madrid, and features in later inventories. It was thought that it was one of Granvelle's painting bought (through imperial arm-twisting) by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor from Ganvelle's heirs in 1600, and was later given to Philip III of Spain.Museo del Prado, Catálogo de las pinturas, 1996, p. 401, Ministerio de Educación y Cultura, Madrid, Hugh Trevor-Roper thought that the organist \\"has the features of Philip [II]\\",Trevor-Roper, 52 but this seems to be a minority view among recent sources; the Berlin version has also been thought to show him;Rearick, W. R. \\"Titian's Later Mythologies.\\" 24, Artibus Et Historiae 17, no. 33 (1996): 23-67. doi:10.2307/1483551 Penny draws attention to the variable quality of the Berlin version, and calls the painting of the head \\"superb\\", where the drapery is \\"dull\\", the organ \\"routine\\", but the dog \\"an inspiration\\".Penny, 283 Lutenist versions Venus with an Lutenist, c. 1565–70, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York The two main versions of Venus and Cupid with a Lute-player are similar in all but details. The one in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge is the earlier, dated by the museum to 1555–65, measuring 150.5 x 196.8 cm, and attributed just to Titian. It probably belonged to Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, and was certainly in the Imperial Collection in Prague by 1621. It then followed the path of the best of this collection: looted by the Swedes in 1648, taken to Rome by Queen Christina of Sweden when she abdicated, sold to the Orleans Collection after her death, and finally auctioned in London after the French Revolution. It was bought by Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam in 1798/99, whose bequest of his collections at his death in 1816 founded the museum.Venus and Cupid with a lute-player Fitzwilliam page The Metropolitan Museum of Art dates its version, which it calls Venus and the Lute Player, to c. 1565–70 (65 x 82 1/2 inches/165.1 x 209.6 cm), and attributes it to Titian and his workshop. It has been traced from the Cambridge version, and there may well have been a cartoon or a \\"studio version\\" for copying kept in Venice.Christiansen; see Penny, 280–284 for a similar discussion relating to Venus and Adonis. It may have been kept in the studio for many years, being worked on sporadically, as the landscape, which is of high quality, \\"painted with speed and authority in Titian's freest style\\",Hartt, 603 seems to match his style of about 1560, but other parts do not. Possibly it was unfinished at Titian's death in 1576, and then \\"following his death, certain parts such as Venus's face and hands were brought to a much higher degree of finish\\", and some areas left unfinished.Venus and the Lute Player Metropolitan page, quoted; Christiansen The New York version belonged to members of the royal family of Savoy from at the latest 1624 until some time after 1742. It then came to England and was owned by Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (d. 1759) and his heirs until sold to the dealer Joseph Duveen in 1930, who sold it to the museum in 1933.MMA Provenance section, same webpage as Christiansen It had been at Holkham Hall in Norfolk, and in older sources may be called the Holkham Venus.For example by Edgar Wind in Wind, 143 note 7 (first published in 1958) Other versions with a lute-player, perhaps at least from Titian's workshop, are one in Bordeaux, and one destroyed in World War II in Dresden.McIver, 20 note 7 Notes References *Brotton, Jerry, The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and His Art Collection, 2007, Pan Macmillan, *Bull, Malcolm, The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods, Oxford UP, 2005, *Christiansen, Keith, Catalogue Entry, Metropolitan Museum website, extracted from ?, 2010 *Clark, Kenneth, The Nude, A Study in Ideal Form, orig. 1949, various edns, page refs from Pelican edn of 1960 *Falomir, Miguel, \\"Titian's Replicas and Variants\\", in Jaffé, David (ed), Titian, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, *Freedburg, Sidney J..

Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquise del Vasto, was a noble Neapolitan, descended from a family of Castilian origin. He participated in the Battle of Pavia and the conquest of Tunis in 1535. In 1538 he was appointed governor of Milan. Military failures caused a subsequent falling out of favor with the Emperor Charles V. This work is both a portrait of the Marquis del Vasto and a picture of history narrating an incident that occurred in 1537. The Spanish troops stationed in Milan began an attempted mutiny over not receiving their pay, but the conflict was suppressed by the Marquis' eloquent speech to the men that inspired loyalty and guaranteed their pay given patience. He, having to leave for affairs elsewhere, left his son with the troops as a guarantee they would be paid. The marquis contracted Titian to paint the scene, depicting his son as a page holding his helmet for him during the speech. The composition is based on classical models, such as the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine and numerous Numismatic works. Titian features the General in an elevated position, addressing his men, and emphasizing his words, as advised classical oratory manuals, with elevation of the right arm. The work was commissioned in 1539 by the Marquis himself, during a trip to Venice. His first public exhibition was in Milan during 1541, taking advantage of the visit of Emperor Charles. It was subsequently acquired by the Gonzaga family, the Dukes of Mantua, and finally by King Charles I of England. When this King was executed his assets were auctioned, and the painting (like others of the same king) was acquired by Philip IV of Spain. In 1828 Fernando VII ceded it to the collection to the Museo del Prado.

William Freind (also Friend), rector of Croughton, Northamptonshire, was born there, and at an early age was sent to Westminster School, where he was admitted on the foundation in 1680. He obtained his election to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1686, and graduated B.A. 1690, M.A. 1693, and B.D. and D.D. 1709. Freind served the office of proctor in 1698, and in the following year was appointed under-master of Westminster School in the place of Michael Maittaire. In 1711 he succeeded Thomas Knipe as the head-master, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of Witney in Oxfordshire. Freind was appointed a canon of Windsor by letters patent dated 29 April 1729, and was installed a prebendary of Westminster Abbey on 8 May 1731. On his retirement from the head-mastership in 1733 he was succeeded by John Nicoll, who had served nearly twenty years as the under-master of the school. On 26 March 1739 Freind resigned the living of Witney, which, through the influence of the Queen and Lady Sundon, he had succeeded in making over to his son. In March 1737 he was appointed canon of Christ Church, but he resigned his stall at Westminster in favour of his son in 1744. Freind died on 7 August 1751, aged 84, and was buried in the chancel of Witney Church. There were two portraits of Freind at Christ Church, the one in the hall being painted by Michael Dahl. There is also in the library of the college a bust of Freind, executed by Michael Rysbrack in 1738. A portrait of Freind was also preserved along with the portraits of the other headmasters at Westminster School. Freind was sociable, a scholar, and a successful schoolmaster; his circle included Francis Atterbury. Matthew Prior and Jonathan Swift. With Atterbury and other old Westminster boys he helped in the production of Charles Boyle's attack on Richard Bentley. Freind's niece, however, married a son of Bentley. Works While a student Freind contributed English verses to the Vota Oxoniensia (1689) On the Inauguration of King William and Queen Mary, reprinted in John Nichols's Select Collection of Poems (vii. 122–4); a Latin ode On the Death of Queen Caroline in 1738, which has also been attributed to him, is by his son William. Two of his Latin poems, entitled Encænium Rusticum, anglice a Country Wake, and Pugna Gallorum Gallinaceorum, are printed in the Musarum Anglicanarum Delectus Alter, 1698. Oratio publice habita in Scholâ Westmonasteriensi 7° die Maii, 1705, aucthore Roberto Friend, A.M., is among the Lansdowne MSS. A Latin ode to the Duke of Newcastle, written by Freind in 1737, appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine (vii. 631). Freind also wrote the lengthy dedication to the queen for the medical works of his brother John Freind, which were published in 1733; and a number of epitaphs and other monumental inscriptions. Freind published also: * A Sermon preach'd before the Honble. House of Commons at S. Margaret's, Westminster, on Tuesday, Jany. 30, 1710–11, being the Anniversary Fast for the Martyrdom of King Charles I, London, 1710. * Cicero's Orator, London, 1724. Family Freind married Jane, only daughter of Dr. Samuel De l'Angle, prebendary of Westminster, whose son, John Maximilian De l'Angle, became the husband of Freind's sister, Anne. Freind had four children, three of whom died under age. The other, William Freind, succeeded his father in the living of Witney, and became dean of Canterbury.

J. Heinz Company complex, part of which is currently known as Heinz Lofts, is a historic industrial complex in the Troy Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The buildings were built by the H. J. Heinz Company from 1907 through 1958. The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and five of the buildings are listed as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark. Buildings The Service and Auditorium Building, built in 1930 The complex contains eleven buildings, nine of which are contributing buildings of the NRHP listing. The contributing buildings, built between 1907 and 1937, are the Administration Building (1907), Bean Building (1913), Power Building (1914), Shipping Building (1915), Meat Building (1923), Cereal Building (1926), Reservoir Building (1927), Service and Auditorium Building (1930), and the Administration Annex (1937). The Administration Building is built of terra cotta, stone, and brick in the Beaux-Arts style and its annex is built of blond brick in the Commercial style. All the other contributing buildings are built of red brick and stone in the Romanesque Revival style. The two non-contributing buildings in the complex are the Riley Research Building — an International style building from 1958 — and a guard booth. History From left to right, the Service, Meat, and Cereal Buildings; a sign reading \\"HEINZ LOFTS\\" connects Meat and Cereal The Heinz Company was founded in 1876 and leased several buildings until 1890. In 1884, German-American Henry J. Heinz purchased several lots on the north bank of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh. From 1888 through 1906, approximately twenty buildings were built or purchased, mostly of wood and beam construction. From 1906 through 1930, new buildings in the complex were made of steel and concrete instead of wood. The buildings from this period reflected Henry Heinz's Romanesque Revival influence, in contrast with the modern industrial style at the time, even after his death in 1919. Through the 1930s and 1940s, many surrounding houses and small commercial buildings were demolished to accommodate parking lots for the plant. In the 1950s, several of the Romanesque Revival buildings were demolished and new buildings were built in modern industrial and International style. From 1999 to 2001, Heinz built a warehouse on the east side and moved its headquarters to downtown Pittsburgh. By 2001, many of the historic buildings had been vacant for five to eight years. Heinz had no long-term plans for the buildings and sold them to a residential developer. On July 10, 2002, the historic complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"H.J. Heinz Company\\". In 2005, the complex was documented as part of the Historic American Engineering Record. In 2005, the Cereal, Bean, Meat, Reservoir and Shipping Buildings opened as Heinz Lofts. The Shipping Building houses a parking garage and the other four house apartments. In 2007, the five buildings of the Heinz Lofts were listed as a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark. In 2014, Heinz Lofts sought to expand by purchasing the Service Building. In 2016, a different residential developer purchased the Administration Building, the Administration Annex, and the Riley Research Building.

Cives Mundi is currently developing its projects for cooperation in Latin America, Caribbean, Maghreb, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.  History  Cives Mundi was founded on November 11, 1987 as a cultural association aiming at making exchanges with Eastern countries in Europe. Cooperation activities were not carried out until ten years later. In 1998 the first cooperation project for Cives Mundi as a non-governmental organization was identified. A plan for the full development of the Cochabamba Peruvian region. Cochabamba was one of the least favoured regions of the Andean country and suffered from a serious problem of children malnutrition and illiteracy. In 2005 Cives Mundi started to work in the Dominican Republic, Tunisia{spa}Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Kenya, Tanzania, Philippines, Cambodia and Bangladesh.  Areas of activity  = Maghreb = Since 2005, Cives Mundi has worked in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Mauritania within the Collective Network for the Sustainable Development of Oasis (RADDO, for its French acronym) in restoring several oasis {spa} in the countries and, thus, fighting against desertification.{spa} One general objective of Cives Mundi is to diminish the consequences of environmental degradation in rural areas where poverty areas exist by promoting sustainable farming techniques, improving the management of water resources and establishing renewable energies. Other main objective is to develop activities to raise public awareness, instruct and deal with gender issues in order to consolidate and, whenever possible, create a civil society.{spa} = Lebanon = In Lebanon Cives Mundi works in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp of Palestinian refugees. This camp is situated at the south of Beirut, near the city of Saida. The project offers professional training courses to youngsters and teenagers. = Sub-Saharan Africa = Cives Mundi carried out the project Life&Living; related to the prevention and fight against AIDS in Kenya and Tanzania. More than 900,000 people benefited from the project.{spa} In Tanzania, it funded {spa} the construction of the 'Emiliano Aguirre' scientific station for research,{spa} in the Oldupai archaeological site,{spa} known as the “Cradle of Mankind”. The scientific station will be used by the Spanish archaeologists in their annual campaigns. The rest of the year, the station will be included in the promotion of the cultural turism of the well-known area of Ngorongoro. = The Caribbean = In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, AIDS prevention has been one of Cives Mundi's main priorities. A project to optimize coffee harvest was also carried out in Loma de Panzo, in the Dominican Republic. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Cives Mundi implemented two projects to help rebuilding the country by reactivating the local economy through craftmanship{spa} in the town of Jacmel. = Latin America = Besides Peru, Cives Mundi carries out projects for cooperation in other countries with different indigenous ethnics. Thus, the Guaraní Indians benefit from the projects in Argentina and Paraguay. The Wiwa Indians are the beneficiaries in Colombia, and the Kichua Indians in Ecuador. Besides, Cives Mundi promoted the twinning between the Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos) island in Ecuador, and the Berlanga de Duero village in the Spanish town of Soria. Berlanga de Duero is the birthplace of Fray Tomás de Berlanga, discoverer of the archipelago. = Asia = In Asia Cives Mundi works in Cambodia and in Bangladesh. In Cambodia, Cives Mundi works with the forestry communities in the north of the country. In Bangladesh, it works in a project to improve the life conditions of the physically handicapped.  Other activities  = Raising public awareness =  Film Festivals  Cives Mundi has established three film festivals to raise public awareness on different issues. The Sinima Festival (Arabic language films) dealt with the situation in the Middle East and the Maghreb. The Tribal Festival{spa} approached the problems of native people in several continents from the point of view of different film directors. Those problems included the great variety of ethnics existing between the Southern cone of South America and the Indians in the United States, the Sami village in northern Europe], and the Australian aborigines.{spa} This Festival aimed at emphasizing the vulnerable situation of these groups as a consequence of the discrimination and neglect of the government and the media. These are the reasons why these groups have not been able to put into practise their own forms of development and ways of life.{spa}  Symposiums, seminars, congresses and round tables  In 2006, the Cives Mundi organized a seminar entitled Lo que la Sociedad Civil y ONG deben saber y pueden hacer (What the Civil Society and the NGO Must Know and Can Do). During this seminar its influence on corporate social responsibility was analyzed.{spa} Furthermore, the Cives Mundi participates in countless round tables in universities aiming at achieving an approach from students to the reality of inequality and poverty in the world.{spa}  Expositions  Cives Mundi, along with the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), started an itinerant exposition of the project Life&Living; by the end of 2008. This exposition included a sample of different images and materials related to actions implemented in Kenya and Tanzania on the prevention of AIDS contagion.{spa} These two countries have some of the highest HIV - AIDS indicators in the world and are among the countries with extreme poverty.{spa} = Culture = In 2007, Cives Mundi was in charge of scheduling and coordinating all the events celebrated in the centenary of the arrival of Antonio Machado to Soria. Besides, the organization has implemented different cultural audiovisual festivals. An example of the later is the festival organized in 2010 to honour{spa} Lorenzo Soler. The films screened during this festival were Apuntes para una odisea soriana interpretada por negros (Notes for an odyssey in Soria interpreted by black people), El viaje inverso (The inverted trip) o Historias de España (Stories of Spain). All the films were shot in the province of Soria. Cives Mundi also produced its own cultural material. In 2002 it published the book Crónica de Cochabamba (The Cochabamba Chronicles) {spa} by the journalist José Luis Bravo. The book is a reflection of the life of the inhabitants in Cochabamba, and is focused on the actions developed in the Peruvian region.{spa} = Fair Trade = Cives Mundi launched a fair trade initiative in 2006 entitled Sechura. This initiative sold ceramic pieces of Peruvian origin named chulucanas, an ornamental pottery designed with black and white geometric figures. The ceramic pieces were made by the Vicús ethnic in the Sechura desert, in the north of Peru.{spa} References External links * {SPA} * {FRA} RADDO Website * {SPA} Sechura Website Political organisations based in Spain Nature conservation organizations Organizations established in 1987 1987 establishments in Spain ","title":"Cives Mundi"},{"id":"32786406","text":"James Hatley Frere (1779–1866), was an English writer on prophecy and developer of a tactile alphabet system for teaching the blind to read. Life Frere was the sixth son of John Frere, of Roydon, South Norfolk, and Beddington, Surrey, by Jane, daughter and heiress of John Hookham of London. On 15 June 1809 he married Merian, second daughter of Matthew Martin, F.R.S., of Poets' Corner, Westminster, by whom he had six sons: – Hatley Frere (1811–1868), Judge of the High Court, Madras (great-grandfather of Mary Leakey) – Chales Frere (1813–1884), Taxing Master of the House of Commons, Barrister- at-law – John Alexander Frere (1814–1877), Vicar of Shillington, Bedfordshire – Edward Daniel Frere (1816–1881) – Constantine Frere (1817–1905), Rector of Finningham – William Theodore Frere (1820–?), died as an infant. Frere met Edward Irving in 1825, and influenced him in the direction of the study of biblical prophecy.Stephen Hunt, Christian Millenarianism: from the early church to Waco (2001), pp. 106–7; Google Books. He died at the residence of his third son, the Rev. John Alexander Frere, Shillington vicarage, Bedfordshire, on 8 December 1866. Inventor About 1838 Frere introduced a tactile alphabet, a phonetic system for teaching the blind to read. He had the advantage of having his plan carried out by a blind man, who suggested several changes. His characters consist of straight lines, half circles, hooked lines, and angles of forty-five degrees, together with a hollow and solid circle. He also invented the 'return' lines—that is to say, the lines in his book are read from left to right and from right to left alternately, the letters themselves being reversed in the return lines. Although useful in enabling uneducated persons to read in a short space of time, Frere's system was found to vitiate pronunciation. In 1871 it was in use at only three home institutions. He devised a cheap method of setting up and stereotyping his books. 'The letters, formed of copper wire, are laid on a tin plate, previously washed over with a solution of zinc; when heat is applied to the under-surface, the letter becomes soldered on to the plate, and such plates produced extremely good printing'. T. M. Lucas of Bristol and William Moon of Brighton adopted this system of stereotyping. Works George Stanley Faber and Samuel Roffey Maitland found Frere's biblical studies of some interest. He was a premillennialist.Jane Garnett, Colin Matthew, Henry Colin Gray Matthew, Revival and Religion since 1700: essays for John Walsh (1993), p. 106; Google Books. Aided by Miss Yates of Fairlawn, Frere was able to have 'The Book of the Prophet Isaiah' printed from embossed metallic plates according to his stereotyping method (London, 1843–9). His other works are: * 'A Combined View of the Prophecies of Daniel, Esdras, and S. John, shewing that all the prophetic writings are formed upon one plan … Also a minute explanation of the prophecies of Daniel; together with critical remarks upon the interpretations of preceding commentators, and more particularly upon the systems of Mr. Faber and Mr. Cunninghame,’ London, 1815 (2nd edit., same year).

This family includes eukaryotic fructosamine-3-kinase enzymes which may initiate a process leading to the deglycation of fructoselysine and of glycated proteins and in the phosphorylation of 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose, fructoselysine, fructoseglycine, fructose and glycated lysozyme. The family also includes ketosamine-3-kinases (KT3K). Ketosamines derive from a non- enzymatic reaction between a sugar and a protein. Ketosamine-3-kinases (KT3K) catalyse the phosphorylation of the ketosamine moiety of glycated proteins. The instability of a phosphorylated ketosamine leads to its degradation, and KT3K is thus thought to be involved in protein repair. The function of the prokaryotic members of this group has not been established. However, several lines of evidence indicate that they may function as fructosamine-3-kinases (FN3K). First, they are similar to characterised FN3K from mouse and human. Second, the Escherichia coli members are found in close proximity on the genome to fructose-6-phosphate kinase (PfkB).

In extreme cases, the child is used to fill the void of the alienating parent's emotional life.R. A. Gardner et al., The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome (2006) p. 200 Two distinct types of parentification have been identified technically: instrumental parentification and emotional parentification. Instrumental parentification involves the child completing physical tasks for the family, such as looking after a sick relative, paying bills, or providing assistance to younger siblings that would normally be provided by a parent. Emotional parentification occurs when a child or adolescent must take on the role of a confidant or mediator for (or between) parents or family members.Gregory J. Jurkovic, 'Destructive Parentification in Families' in Luciano L'Abate ed., Family Psychopathology (New York 1998) pp. 237–255 Prehistory Melitta Schmideberg noted in 1948 how emotional deprivation could lead parents to treat their children (unconsciously) as substitute parent figures.Jurkovic, p. 240 \\"Spousification\\" and \\"parental child\\" (Minuchin) offered alternative concepts exploring the same phenomenon; while the theme of intergenerational continuity in such violations of personal boundaries was further examined.Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 240 Eric Berne touched on the dangers of parents and children having a symmetrical, rather than asymmetrical relationship, as when an absent spouse is replaced by the eldest child;Eric Berne, Sex in Human Loving (Penguin 1970) p. 249–53 and Virginia Satir wrote of \\"the role-function discrepancy...where the son gets into a head-of-the- family role, commonly that of the father\\".Virginia Satir, Peoplemaking (1983) p. 167 Object relations theory highlighted how the child's false self is called into being when it is forced prematurely to take excessive care of the parental object;Adam Phillips, On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored (1994) p. 31 and John Bowlby looked at what he called \\"compulsive caregiving\\" among the anxiously attached, as a result of a parent inverting the normal relationship and pressuring the child to be an attachment figure for them.John Bowlby, The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds (London 1979) p. 137–38 All such aspects of disturbed and inverted parenting patterns have been drawn under the umbrella of the wider phenomenon of parentification – with the result (critics suggest) that on occasion \\"ironically the concept of parentification has...been as over-burdened as the child it often describes\\".Karpel, quoted by Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 238 Choice of child For practical reasons, elder children are generally chosen for the familial \\"parental\\" role – very often the first-born children who were put in the anomalous role.Satir, p. 167 However, gender considerations mean that sometimes the eldest boy or eldest girl was selected, even if they are not the oldest child overall, for such reasons as the preference to match the sex of the missing parent. Thus where there is a disabled child in the family to be cared for, \\"older siblings, especially girls, are at the greatest risk of parentification\\";Bryna Siegal, What about Me (2002) p. 131 where a father-figure is missing, it may be the eldest son who is forced to take on his father's responsibilities, without ever obtaining the autonomy that normally accompanies such adult roles.Harold Bloom, Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie (2007) p. 142 Alternatively a widower may put a daughter into the social and emotional role of his deceased wife – \\"spousification\\"; or a mother can oblige her daughter to play the caring role, in a betrayal of the child's normal expectation of love and care.Diana Brandt, Wild Mother Dancing (1993) p. 54 Narcissistic Narcissistic parentification occurs when a child is forced to take on the parent's idealised projection, something which encourages a compulsive perfectionism in the child at the expense of their natural development.Jurkovic, in L'Abate, ed., p. 246-7 In a kind of pseudo- identification, the child is induced by any and all means to take on the characteristics of the parental ego idealOtto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of the Neuroses (London 1946) p. 510-11 - a pattern that has been detected in western culture since Homer's description of the character of Achilles.R. K. Holway, Becoming Achilles (2011) Chapter Five 'Fathers and Sons'; and notes p. 218–19 Disadvantages The almost inevitable byproduct of parentification is losing one's own childhood.Siegal, p. 114 In destructive parentification, the child in question takes on excessive responsibility in the family, without their caretaking being acknowledged and supported by others:Jurkovic, p. 237 by adopting the role of parental care-giver, the child loses their real place in the family unit and is left lonely and unsure. In extreme instances, there may be what has been called a kind of disembodiment, a narcissistic wound that threatens one's basic self-identity.Paula M. Reeves, in Nancy D. Chase, Burdened Children (1999) p. 171 In later life, parentified children often experience anxiety over abandonment and loss, and demonstrate difficulty handling rejection and disappointment within interpersonal relationships. All results of parentification are negative.

Dickens Blog. Agnes is forced to be the parent of her alcoholic father and seems to strive for perfection as a means of reaching the \\"ego ideal\\" of her deceased mother (who died upon child-birth). Agnes marries late, has relationship and intimacy problems (she has a hard time expressing her love for David until he reveals his own love for her), and has some self-defeating attitudes; in one scene she blames her own father's misfortunes on herself. However, she proves to be resilient, resourceful, responsible and even potentially career-driven (she forms her own school). She also manages to marry the protagonist David and the two live happily together for 10 years with children by the end of the novel.

It was self-published by the developer on the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms. The Xbox 360 version was published by Bandai Namco Partners. The game features multiple game modes which are primarily focused on combat racing. Two downloadable content packs have been released which add additional planes and two new game modes. The game was well received, with aggregate scores ranging in the mid-to-high 70% range. Critics generally felt that the gameplay was strong, that the controls were responsive, and that the online multiplayer was excellent, though multiple reviewers cited disappointment in the lack of any local multiplayer. Gameplay SkyDrift is an airplane racing game with a heavy emphasis on combat. In SkyDrift players pilot one of several airplanes in a fictional racing competition. Gameplay is similar to other airplane racing games such as Plane Crazy and the flight mode of Diddy Kong Racing. The game features 33 single player challenge stages as well as online multiplayer. While the primary focus is racing, dogfights play a large part in some of SkyDrifts game modes. Players are rewarded with boost, which provides a temporary burst of speed, by flying acrobatically, low to the ground, or by taking down opponents. Planes and their separate liveries are unlocked as players progress and complete specified challenges. As players progress on a given course they are sometimes presented with progressing environment hazards such as falling rocks or an avalanche. Three game modes are included with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank at the end of a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible. The third mode included with the game is known as Survivor. Gameplay is similar to Power Race, however after a given time the racer in last place is eliminated. Powerups are included in this mode and can be used to increase one's place, thus avoiding elimination. The race is over when all human players are eliminated or a human player is takes first place. The two downloadable modes, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, are focused solely on dogfights with other players. These modes are played in three new arenas and are limited to online gameplay. Development and marketing The developers stated that they wanted to keep a certain amount of realism to the setting of their game. \\"It's not science fiction, it's like racing on the most beautiful places on earth\\" stated Senior Game Designer Peter Petrekovits. Development began with low polygon versions of the game's three settings to hone gameplay, which were later upgraded with details created from primitive shapes. Artists then took these settings and provided finalized environments while course designers laid out the specific elements to each race. Multiple routes were created in each setting allowing for several course configurations. Some of the plane designs were inspired from real-world fighter planes, but each were evolved from initial concept art into their current designs. Petrekovits elaborated on their design. \\"These planes are not real life models. You might see some part[s] of them [that are] familiar, but these are whole new concepts\\". Petrekovits further clarified that though the planes can be equipped with weaponry via powerups, they \\"are not military planes whatsoever, [they] are racing planes.\\" Two members of the game's development team were graduate airplane technicians. Two downloadable content packs have been released, both of which are actually included in the main game but require premium unlock keys to be accessed. The first, entitled Extreme Fighters Pack, was released on September 21, 2011 and adds three additional planes, the Vanguard, Sparrow X1 and Triwing Vintage. The first two planes feature a design similar to modern day fighter jets, while the latter focuses on older, Red Baron-style planes such as the triplane. The second pack, entitled Gladiator Pack brings six new combat arenas into the game. These new levels have a focus entirely on dogfights, and have all racing aspects removed. Reception The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of SkyDrift received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PC version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. According to Gamasutra's analysis SkyDrift moved over 5,100 units on the Xbox 360 and 4,700 units on the PlayStation 3 during the month of its release. The Xbox 360 version moved over 7,500 units as of year-end 2011. The game's visuals were well received by critics. IGN reviewer Stephanie Lee lauded the visuals. She stated that the graphics are \\"beautiful detail and [have] a warm color palette\\". Robert Workman of GameZone also gave high marks for SkyDrifts graphics. He felt that the planes were well modeled and that the environments provided \\"a smooth looking package.\\" GameSpot's Sean Evans called the graphics \\"visually striking, with impressive levels of detail.\\" He did cite occasional issues with locating powerups, which he attributed to \\"overly saturated lighting effects\\". The game's soundtrack was a point of mediocrity among critics. IGN's Lee stated that SkyDrifts soundtrack \\"doesn't stand out nor does it detract from the overall experience,\\" a sentiment shared with GameZone's Workman. Gameplay was also well received. Eurogamers Kristan Reed noted that the Xbox 360 version's \\"controls are spot-on, and it's easy to pick up\\". Reed, however, felt that the game can lose its luster for some players quickly due to the repeated environments used throughout the game. Terry Terrones of GamePro stated that the game was \\"the definition of easy to play and tough to master\\". GameSpot's Evans noted that the game's online multiplayer was \\"lag free\\" and was the game's \\"shining jewel\\", however he expressed disappointment with the fact that it did not feature a local multiplayer. IGN's Lee also praised the online multiplayer, but was disappointed in the lack of local play. She did concede, however, that during single player events \\"the A.I. still knows how to throw down.\\"  See also  * Plane Crazy (a similar game released in 1998) References External links 2011 video games PlayStation 3 games PlayStation Network games Racing video games Flight simulation video games Vehicular combat games Video games developed in Hungary Windows games Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Xbox 360 games ","title":"SkyDrift"},{"id":"32786478","text":"Honor Courtney Maude (née King; Wem, Shropshire; 10 July 1905 – 15 April 2001, Canberra, Australia)Obituary, tandfonline.com; accessed 20 December 2017. was a British-Australian authority on Oceanic string figures,\\"Honor Maude\\", The Journal of Pacific History, p. 253.

Early life E.T.C. Werner was born at Port Chalmers, Dunedin, New Zealand. His father was Prussian and his mother English. He was educated at Tonbridge School. His father died in 1878 and E.T.C. had to find a career. He passed the entrance exams to the Far Eastern Cadetship. Diplomatic career Werner arrived in Peking in the 1880s attached to the British Legation as a student interpreter. Werner remained in the British consular service in China until 1914 serving in postings including time working in the Chancery at the Peking Legation, then a year in Canton (Guangzhou), two in Tientsin (Tianjin) and another couple in Macao. He later spent a year in Hangchow (Hangzhou), one in the Pagoda Anchorage (Mawei), a year in the isolated Kiungchow (Qiongshan) on Hainan Island in 1900, a couple of years on the Gulf of Tonkin in the remote posting of Pakhoi (Beihai) before being posted to Kongmoon (Jiangmen). Promotion saw Werner Consul at the busy tea port of Kiukiang (Jiujiang), serving for four years. In 1911 Werner became British Consul-General in Foochow (Fuzhou). He left the consular service in 1914. Contributions to Sinology After retirement Werner moved back to Peking where he concentrated on his Sinological studies. He was a member of the planning committee of the Peking Union Medical College, a lecturer at Peking University, member of the Chinese government’s Historiography Bureau and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society. Personal life E.T.C. Werner was married to Gladys Nina Ravenshaw (1886–1922) in 1911 in Hong Kong. Gladys was the daughter of Lieutenant- Colonel Charles Withers Ravenshaw, the former British Resident in Nepal. In 1919 the couple adopted a baby daughter, Pamela, in Peking. Between 1943 and 1945 E.T.C. Werner was interned by the Japanese at the Weihsien Internment Camp, The Weihsien Compound, in Shandong. Pamela was murdered in January 1937, a crime that has never been solved. In 2011, the British author Paul French, an expatriate living in China, published a study of the murder, Midnight in Peking, which explores the career and character of Werner and offers a solution to the mystery.Paul French.

Jonathan Spence, in a review of the book, speculates that part of the reason that the crime was not solved was that Werner made \\"a self-insulating cult of his loneliness. It may indeed have been true that he disliked most people he met, and that he made no attempt to conceal it.\\" He adds that Werner was \\"not the kind of man who made people want to help when he was in trouble. He infuriated the British, failed to get in close touch with the Chinese officers assigned to the case, gave his own contradictory press conferences on the steps of the regional substation, and rooted around the probable crime scenes without permission.\\" Jonathan Spence,Who Killed Pamela in Peking?

It is regarded not only as one of the first modern novels in French, but also as both the prototype and a masterpiece of the historical novel. Set in France during the Wars of Religion, it tells the story of a young noblewoman, married without affection and loved platonically by her husband's best friend, who cannot refuse her former fiancé's impetuous brother and collapses under the emotional stress. Some of the characters are historical and some made up for the story. Plot The intelligent and good-looking Renée d'Anjou-Mézières is promised to the Duke of Mayenne, and she loves his brother, the Duke of Guise, who loves her back. Unfortunately, France becomes convulsed in the Wars of Religion and the leading families are forced to take sides. To the fury of Guise, her parents prefer an alliance with the powerful Montpensier family and she is married to the young Prince of Montpensier. As he has to go off to the wars, he leaves her at his castle in the care of the Count of Chabanes, his oldest and most trusted friend, who is to be her tutor. Chabanes soon falls in love with the girl and, being intrinsically honest, admits it to her. She says they must remain friends and nothing more. Her peaceful life in the country is disrupted when two great men are riding across the estate and see her in a boat on the river. One is her former suitor Guise, who has not stopped wanting her, and the other is the heir to the throne, the Duke of Anjou. Determined to see more of her, Anjou invites himself and Guise to the castle, where Montpensier arrives as well to be their host. At the dinner table, the princess is surrounded by four men who desire her and, in the case of Montpensier and Guise, hate each other. When the Montpensiers are summoned to Paris, Guise tells Renée he still loves her while Anjou tries to win her favour. At a masked ball, the princess thinks she is talking to Guise and says how Anjou is pursuing her. In fact the man she whispered to was Anjou, who forms a deep hatred for Guise. Suspicious, Montpensier orders his wife back to their castle and she then prevails on Chabanes, whom everybody trusts, to carry messages to and from Guise. This becomes dangerous when Montpensier returns to the castle. Through Chabanes, Guise says he must see Renée face to face and, when she agrees, Chabanes smuggles him into her bedroom. A noise wakes up Montpensier who, finding Renée 's bedroom door locked, in fury starts breaking it down. When he bursts in, he finds Chabanes standing calmly and the princess fainted on the tiled floor. Chabanes says things are not what they seem and that Renée, in a state of nervous collapse, needs putting to bed. She never recovers from the shock. Chabanes is murdered by followers of Guise in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and Guise swiftly makes an advantageous marriage. When the princess hears the news, she dies :unable to overcome the grief of having lost the respect of her husband, the heart of her lover, and the best friend there ever was. Major themes Love versus duty is the overriding theme of the book. An attractive and thoughtful young woman is torn between her desire for another man and her responsibilities as a wife. In this, she prefigures both the author's later novel The Princess of Cleves and the tragic heroines in the plays of Jean Racine. Her fate reflects the danger of uncontrolled emotion in a strictly regulated society, where a woman's reputation is destroyed by perceived imprudence. Style Compared with the floweriness and pomposity of much preceding French fiction, Madame de La Fayette writes in a pared-down prose which almost has the air of a dispassionate observer. Background Novellas by Jean Regnault de Segrais pioneered what has become the modern French novel. Following Spanish models, he used a simple linear plot line and replaced artificial classical names with real French names. But he left locations vague, psychology inconsistent, and external events prevailed over internal emotions. Madame de La Fayette's developments in her first work were bold and unprecedented. The principal character is based on a real French woman in named places at a specific time in history, with her emotional trajectory described and analysed. Breaking away from the improbabilities of heroic and pastoral romances, believable characters live through the actual dramatic events of the period, recreated with accuracy, and it is their internal conflicts which are the subject of the novel. Publication history The first edition, in octavo with 142 pages, was published anonymously by T. Jolly in Paris in 1662. Handwritten copies of the work had been circulating for some time before, leading the author to complain that the novella 'is racing all over the place, but happily not under my name'.

Madame de La Fayette Reception After over 350 years the book is still widely read in France, where for the 2017–18 academic year it was a set book in the baccalauréat littéraire, the first time in the history of the examination that a work by a woman author had been included. Nevertheless, for both the 2018–2019 but also the 2019–2020 French baccalauréat, this book has been added in the \\"literature\\" syllabushttps://lettres.ac-versailles.fr/spip.php?breve155 of the 12th French grader. Its inclusion made the book a core part of the syllabus, as one of the two major works studied in the school year. Adaptations An adaptation for cinema was the 2010 film The Princess of Montpensier, directed by Bertrand Tavernier and scripted by him and Jean Cosmos from a treatment by François-Olivier Rousseau, which starred Mélanie Thierry as the conflicted heroine. The film was included alongside the novella in the French baccalauréat in order to offer a comparative analysis.

History  Tobruk was formerly the historic settlement of Antipyrgos, offering a major harbor for the hellenic states. The port has never been systematically surveyed for archeological findings to evaluate the use of the port during this time. During the Italo-Turkish War in 1911, Tobruk was the landing point for 35,000 Italian soldiers under the command of . During World War II, the port, one of the most valuable deep water ports in North Africa, was fortified by 12,000 British and Indian troops and 14,000 Australian troops. Starting in April 1941 and ending in November 1941, German general Erwin Rommel surrounded the port besieging the troops resulting in the Siege of Tobruk. During the 1960s, high viscocity oil from the Sarir field was piped to Tobruk for loading on vessels, because the oil was not safe to load at sea. The port has been constructed by late 1966. The first oil cargo had been exported on . It had been run by British Petroleum till 1971, when the Libyan branch of the company had been nationalized.Al - Mesh'al (petroleum) magazine, February 1988, No. 62, p.40.

As of August 2014, all port traffic from the Port of Benghazi will be diverted to the port of Tobruk due to the closure of the port in Benghazi as a direct result of the sustained Post-civil war violence in Libya.  Operations  It requires a pilot to enter the port. The port has ten anchorages, with a six-vessel capacity each. As of 2010, the port had three cargo handling cranes, one with a 50-80 ton capacity and two with 30-40 ton capacity.

Background Furness was born the second son of Sir Stephen Wilson Furness, who was Liberal MP for The Hartlepools. He was younger brother of Sir Christopher Furness, 2nd Baronet. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Oriel College, Oxford.‘FURNESS, Stephen Noel’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 29 April 2016 Professional career Furness was Called to Bar by Middle Temple in 1927.‘FURNESS, Stephen Noel’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 29 April 2016 Political career Furness was Liberal candidate for The Hartlepools division of Durham at the 1929 General Election. His father had represented this constituency for the Liberals from 1910–14. The Liberals had lost the seat to the Unionists at the previous election in 1924 by about 3,000 votes. A UK-wide Liberal revival in 1929 helped Furness, but not enough for him to re-take the seat, falling just 138 votes short. He was re-selected by the local Liberal Association to contest the following general election. In 1931, following the economic crisis, a National Government was formed that included both Liberals and Conservatives. A snap election was called and Liberals were encouraged not to oppose sitting Conservative MPs. Furness thus withdrew as Liberal candidate on 14 October, just 13 days before polling day.Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail 14 Oct 1931 Four years later, his personal sacrifice for the National Government was rewarded when he was chosen as a Liberal National candidate for the dual member seat of Sunderland. The Conservatives won both seats in 1931 when there were no Liberals standing. In 1935 one of those MPs retired and Furness was chosen to run in harness with the other Conservative. With no opposition Liberal candidates standing, he was easily elected, topping the poll. In parliament he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir John Simon, the Liberal National Leader, from 1936–37. He was an Assistant Government Whip from 1937–38 and a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1938–40.‘FURNESS, Stephen Noel’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 29 April 2016 When the National Government of Neville Chamberlain fell in 1940 and Winston Churchill formed his Coalition Government, Furness went to the back benches.

At the end of the war, he ran for re-election, again as a Liberal National in harness with a Conservative. However, this time he was defeated as the country turned to the Labour Party.

The CCBE represents around a million European lawyers before EU institutions mainly, but also before other international organisations. The CCBE is an international non-profit organisation (AISBL) under Belgian law and has its seat in Brussels.  Creation and further steps  The CCBE was created in September 1960 during a congress of the Union internationale des avocats (UIA) where it was suggested to create a body representing the bar associations of the six founding Member States of the EEC (Western Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and The Netherlands). The establishment of such a body was seen as necessary in order to represent the interests of lawyers before the EEC. The project came to life in December 1960 with the creation of “The consultative committee of bars and national associations of the six States of the EEC (gathered by the UIA)”. This appellation was eventually simplified to \\"Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe\\", retaining the abbreviation CCBE. The CCBE became autonomous in 1966. The first President of the CCBE was Count Ercole Graziadei. In 1977, the CCBE was closely consulted by the European Commission during the drafting of Directive (EC) 77/249 which permitted EU lawyers to provide temporary services in an EU Member State other than their home Member State. In 1979, the official recognition as representing the interests of the legal profession in Europe was given through its intervention in the case AM&S; Europe Limited v Commission of the European Communities, which focused on the question of legal professional privilege for in-house counsel. From then on, the CCBE established a permanent delegation to the Community Courts. In 1998, the second directive specific to the legal profession, Directive (EC) 98/5, was passed after a long debate within the CCBE. This directive permitted EU lawyers to establish in another Member State, provided that they are registered with, and are regulated by, the local host bar. The CCBE is regularly consulted by the European Commission and the European Parliament about directives concerning the interests of the legal profession in Europe  Members  Today, all the national bar associations of the 28 Member States of the European Union and of the three Member States of the European Economic Area (Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland) and Switzerland are full members within the CCBE. In addition to these “full” members, the bars of other European countries are “associate” members (countries of the Council of Europe in official negotiations with a view of joining the European Union) or “observers” (other countries of the Council of Europe). The associate and observer members have to adhere to the CCBE statutes and are encouraged to adopt the CCBE Code of Conduct.  Object  The CCBE statutes define its object as: #To represent the Bars and Law Societies of its Members, whether full, associate or observer members, on all matters of mutual interest relating to the exercise of the profession of the lawyer, the development of the law and practice pertaining to the rule of law and administration of justice and substantive developments in the law itself, both at a European and international level. #To act as a consultative and intermediary body between its Members, whether full, associate or observer members, and between the Members and the institutions of the European Union and the European Economic Area on all cross border matters of mutual interest as listed under a) above. #To monitor actively the defence of the rule of law, the protection of the fundamental and human rights and freedoms, including the right of access to justice and protection of the client, and the protection of the democratic values inextricably associated with such rights. Specialist committees and working groups made up of experts from national delegations draft CCBE position papers and contributions in many areas affecting the European legal profession. Topics include lawyers’ ethics (“deontology”), competition as it affects the legal profession, the free movement of lawyers, training of lawyers, international trade in legal services, and human rights. In recent years, working groups have concentrated on issues such as legal aid, criminal law, family law and the law of successions, anti-money laundering, European contract law, alternative dispute resolutions, and collective redress. The CCBE is regularly consulted on the changes to the procedures within the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. The CCBE also represents its members in their relations with other lawyers’ organisations in the world for questions of common interest to the legal profession such as fight against terrorism and other serious crimes, and also the ability of lawyers to practice their profession anywhere in the world freely, independently and without any harassment or hindrance.  Specific initiatives  The CCBE identity card was created in 1978. It is drafted in English, in French and in the official language(s) of the issuing bar. The identity card identifies the holder as an admitted lawyer in one of the Member States and facilitates access to courts and institutions for lawyers active outside their home jurisdiction. It is also recognised by the European Court of Justice. Cards are issued in the CCBE’s name by national bars to their authorised members, according to the conditions laid down in each member state. The CCBE Code of Conduct, which was adopted in 1988 and amended three times since then, aims to resolve cross-border conflicts due to the simultaneous application of different national codes of conduct to a same situation. The Code governs professional contacts between lawyers within the European Union and in other countries that have adopted it, and the activities of lawyers working in member states other than their own. The Code is a framework of principles covering professional independence, client confidentiality, advertising of services, and behaviour towards clients, courts and other lawyers. The Code is binding only when adopted by a particular bar. The Code has been recognised by the European Commission and European courts and is beginning to be treated as authoritative by national courts. In 2006, the CCBE adopted a Charter of core principles of the European legal profession. This Charter contains a list of ten principles which have been identified as common to the whole European legal profession and which could be applied by the national bars for their own use and no longer for cross-border cases. Among the principles figure lawyer’s independence, confidentiality and avoidance of conflicts of interest, principles which the European Court of Justice recognised in the Wouters case (C-309/99), and several others on which the member bars agreed. The Charter is to serve as a pan-European document, helping, bars that are struggling to establish their independence in Europe’s emerging democracies. Since 2007, the CCBE has been granting a Human Rights Award. This award highlights the work of an eminent lawyer or lawyers’ organisation that has demonstrated outstanding commitment and sacrifice in upholding fundamental values. Though this award, the CCBE aims to contribute to a major awareness campaign of the role of lawyers as players in the Rule of Law. The first prize was granted in 2007 to Avocats Sans Frontières (ASF).

It is hugely disappointing that this may not have been adhered to.\\" The Guardian, when asked if payments were made to police, said in a statement: \\"In common with all news organizations we have no comment to make on the sources of our journalism.” On 19 August 2011, Desborough's criminal solicitor issued a statement about the matter. Mr. Young issued a comment on behalf of his client: \\"He attended a South London police station voluntarily and by appointment with his Solicitor, Julian Young. He was interviewed for a number of hours and cooperated fully with the police in their investigations. He denied, and continues to deny, any conspiracy to unlawfully intercept voice mails or acting unlawfully in any way.\\" On 27 March 2012, the Metropolitan Police and Operation Weeting confirmed that \\"no further action\\" would be taken against Desborough. Desborough was the first staff employee of the News Of The World to be cleared after an investigation by the Weeting team. His arrest record was expunged. In March 2012 Alison Levitt QC, the principal legal advisor to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said there was \\"sufficient evidence\\" to show that 10 articles written by Guardian journalist Amelia Hill between 4 April 2011 and 18 August 2011 contained confidential information from Operation Weeting, including the names of those who had been arrested. There was also sufficient evidence to establish the police officer in question had disclosed the information to Hill. Neither Hill nor Cripps were charged for their involvement. Desborough issued a statement on 28 March 2012, which said: \\"I would like to thank my friends and family, especially my mother and father, for standing by me unwaveringly over the last few months. I am especially grateful to my solicitor Julian Young who has been nothing short of brilliant throughout. I look forward to resuming my career, after eight months on hold.\\" In an interview with Sky News Young said his client \\"could easily have been interviewed without being formerly nicked and fears his arrest was ordered in a bid to flush out a Yard detective suspected of leaking the latest arrests to a newspaper.\\"  Hollywood correspondent/consultant  Since 2011, Desborough has remained in Los Angeles working for media outlets across the world.

The south aisle and the upper parts of the tower and spire are 13th century work; the intersecting tracery of the east window of the south aisle shows that it is slightly later, dating from around 1300, as does the nearby piscina. The chancel arch is probably also from the late 13th century, and the double piscina in the chancel may be of a similar age. The Easter Sepulchre in the chancel is in the slightly later (Decorated) style, but is a fairly crude example. A finely sculpted capital depicting a Green Man surrounded by oak leaves, similar to examples at nearby Kirkby Underwood and Greatford, also dates from c.1300. It is no longer in position, having been built into a wall, face inwards, and rediscovered during later restoration work.Church guide The stone base of the pulpit is dated 1590, and has a Latin inscription Orate et parate (\\"Pray and prepare\\"). Pevsner mistakenly gives this as Orate et Arate. The Listed Building entry is taken from Pevsner, with the same error.

The film features professional wrestler Triple H (credited as Paul \\"Triple H\\" Levesque), Michael Rapaport, Parker Posey, Julie White, Michael Cudlitz and Bruce Dern. The project was the cinematic feature film debut for director Artie Mandelberg. The film was released on September 9, 2011. Plot A.J., an ex-con who served 13 years in Angola for manslaughter, returns home to New Orleans and fights to protect the woman he loves and her young daughter from his dangerous former best friend. In better times, AJ (Triple H) would have done anything to protect his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), a two-bit gangster and the son of Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) -- the city's toughest crime boss. While A.J. is in prison, Jack marries Claire (Parker Posey), the love of AJ's life, and together they raise a daughter, Pepper (Juliette Goglia). Pepper is A.J.'s daughter, a fact known to Jack, but Jack pretends to be her biological father. The day Jack picks up AJ from prison, the short-fused thug gets an itchy trigger finger that could land his buddy right back behind bars. The situation grows increasingly tense as Dr. Vic attempts to handle the situation quietly as he comes under investigation by the Louisiana Tax Board agent Martha (Julie White) for dealing in untaxed cigarettes. When Jack flees and Dr. Vic decides that the only way to get the job done right is to do it himself, A.J. realizes that Claire and Pepper are in mortal danger, and races to their rescue. Cast Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 25% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 2.66/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 28 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Writing for The New York Times, Daniel M. Gold described the plot as \\"a tangle of dithering storylines\\" and Levesque's acting as \\"inert\\". The New York Post's Lou Lumenick derided Inside Out as \\"nonsensical, thickly plotted gumbo\\" which he found to be unintentionally funnier than Levesque's other starring role in the comedy film The Chaperone. However, Eric Hynes of The Village Voice was more positive, praising the film as a \\"meandering, eccentric, downright adorable existential crime yarn\\", while noting that Levesque's performance was closer to \\"a steroidal Steven Seagal\\" than \\"Hackman or Cagney\\".

However, a combination of annual flooding and ice on the River Bode periodically damaged the works.

It is widely considered the first independent all- Yugoslav political movement. UJDI's basic tenets were the transformation of the state through democratization, freedom of thought and political activity, including free multi-party elections, as well as the support for Yugoslavia as a united federal state, as opposed to centralism and separatism. History In January 1989, UJDI's co-founder Predrag Matvejević described its goal as \\"making the Socialist Alliance [of Working People of Yugoslavia] into a kind of an alternative party, a socialist one, in which alternative solutions and alternative cadres could arise, as well as the rectification of everything about the League of Communists [of Yugoslavia] that was not working and was not good\\". UJDI was founded on February 2, 1989, in Zagreb, by a group of left-leaning intellectuals, notably its first president was Branko Horvat, the second president was Nebojša Popov, its director was Žarko Puhovski and the members included Predrag Matvejević, Abdulah Sidran, Bogdan Bogdanović, Milan Kangrga, Lev Kreft, Shkëlzen Maliqi, Vesna Pešić, Koča Popović, Milorad Pupovac, Karlo Štajner, Ljubiša Ristić, Božidar Gajo Sekulić, Rudi Supek, Ljubomir Tadić, Dubravka Ugrešić, Tibor Várady, Predrag Vranicki, Nenad Zakošek and Jug Grizelj. A Slovenian affiliate of the party was also founded under the leadership of the sociologist Rastko Močnik,Božo Repe, Slovenci v osemdesetih letih, (Ljubljana 2001), 51. but it ceased functioning even before the 1990 multi-party elections. In the 1990 Serbian parliamentary election, it obtained 0.5% and won 1 seat by Tibor Várady. In the 1990 Serbian presidential election, Ivan Đurić ran as the common candidate of UJDI and the Union of Reform Forces and won 5.5% of the vote, finishing in the third place. In 1992, after the breakup of Yugoslavia, its Serbian branch merged into the Civil Alliance of Serbia.

Background Rakti was bred in England by the Italian Azienda Agricola Rosati Colarieti. He was sired by the multiple group race winner Polish Precedent out of the Rainbow Quest mare Ragera. He was a big, powerful bay horse with an unpredictable and sometimes difficult temperament- his trainer saying of him, \\"He's a bully and he'll push you out of the box if he doesn't like the look of you\\". Trained in Italy for his first two seasons, his greatest successes came after he was moved to England to be trained by Michael Jarvis. After his transfer he was ridden in all of his races by Philip Robinson. Racing career =2001–2002: early career= Rakti began his career with two defeats in minor events at San Siro Racecourse, Milan in October 2001, before recording his first win at Pisa in November. He then won his next five races, including victory in the 2002 Derby Italiano, just prior to which he had been purchased by Gary Tanaka. Although he failed to win in his remaining three starts in Italy in 2002, he had been identified as a potential champion, and was relocated to the Newmarket stable of Michael Jarvis in March 2003. =2003: four-year-old season= On his debut for his new connections he won the Premio Presidente della Repubblica by a neck from Tigertail. His Italian form was lightly regarded and he was sent off as a 50/1 outsider for English debut, but he belied his odds with a second place in Prince of Wales's Stakes. After the race, Rakti was found to have sustained a hairline fracture to his ankle and was confined to his box for a month. He returned with a \\"consummately easy\\" win in the Champion Stakes, from a field which included Alamshar, Nayef and Russian Rhythm, leading Michael Jarvis to describe him as \\"certainly one of the best horses I've trained\\". On his final start of the year he finished second in the Hong Kong Cup to Falbrav, the world's top-rated horse at the distance.http://www.horseracingintfed.com/resources/Ratings_All_04.pdf =2004: five-year-old season= In 2004 he won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot on his seasonal debut, beating Powerscourt and Sulamani with what The Independent's Richard Edmondson described as \\"a pulverising burst of speed\\". He was made 13/8 favourite for the Eclipse Stakes, but refused to settle for Philip Robinson, pulled hard from the start and then dropped from contention in the straight. \\"Seriously talented, seriously difficult\\", was Jarvis's comment. After a fifth place in the Irish Champion Stakes he was dropped down in distance for the one mile Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Always running well, he looked \\"unstoppable\\" as went clear in the straight and stayed on to win by half a length from Lucky Story, with Soviet Song and Refuse To Bend well beaten. After the race Jarvis spoke of the difficulties of keeping Rakti controlled, comparing him to \\"an elastic band. You know he is going to snap\\". Jarvis also pointed out that the horse seemed to particularly enjoy racing at Ascot. Unfortunately for them, the racecourse was closed immediately afterwards for redevelopment, with the major races being rescheduled to other tracks for the next twenty months. =2005: six-year-old season= Rakti began 2005 with a win in the Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury taking the lead after a furlong and pulling away to win by five lengths in a race record time of 1:33.59. Philip Robinson paid tribute to the horse describing him as \\"the best horse I’ve sat on – and I’ve been on some good ones\\". He was made odds-on favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes at \\"Royal Ascot\\" (actually held at York), but his temperament caused problems as he bolted on the way to the start- reportedly being startled by a woman making \\"clicking noises\\" and was beaten in the race by the French colt Valixir. In September, a 10% share in Rakti was sold to the Hong Kong Breeders Club, increasing the likelihood that he would compete in December's Hong Kong Mile. Rakti never recaptured his best form after York, with Jarvis becoming increasingly concerned by his horse's volatile temperament. In the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, (run that year at Newmarket), he pulled hard and led early, before fading into fourth behind Starcraft. Speculation about a challenge for the Breeders' Cup Mile came to nothing and Rakti again failed to settle when finishing sixth to David Junior in the Champion Stakes. As expected, Rakti was sent to Sha Tin for his last race, where he ended his career by finishing eleventh of fifteen runners in the Hong Kong Mile. The horse behaved well before the race, but, according to Robinson, \\"he wasn't the same Rakti.\\" Assessment In the 2004 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Rakti was assessed at 123, making him the ninth best horse in the world and the best miler. Rakti was given a Timeform rating of 129 in 2004 and 130 in 2005. Stud career Rakti was retired to stand at the Irish National Stud beginning in 2006. He was later \\"shuttled\\" to stand in Australia, where he died at the Chatswood Stud, Victoria following an accident in December 2010. He made a \\"fair start\\" at stud, and sired a number of winners. His most notable offspring to date being 2013 Victoria Derby winner Polanski.

The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat. Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, is not widely agreed upon, and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza-based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, but the PRC denies involvement. However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad. On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees, Zuhir al-Qaisi, whom Israel considers as \\"one of the masterminds\\" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. Background Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right. The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s. In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier, although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al- Qaeda militants groups were established, after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo.  August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response  The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army. Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet, began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat, when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades, RPGs, and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing. The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at them from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded.Timeline of the attacks on the Sinai border The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile, at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan. According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded. IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Bagdalov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery. Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center. Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba. The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, \\"The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems\\". According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: \\"The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat.\\" Hamas did, however, \\"praise\\" the attack. The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks.  Subsequent events  =Israeli response in the Gaza Strip= At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force, working with Shin Bet, bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah. Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows \\"double\\" revenge. Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis. A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route, believed to have been smuggling tunnels. Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit. The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi, the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees, whom Israel considers as \\"one of the masterminds\\" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. = Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes = After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba, causing no injuries. Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod, wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade, a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack. Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba. The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod. Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome, though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because \\"the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days\\" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome. Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus, which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an \\"urgent meeting\\" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses. Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim, injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council. A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal. Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council, and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. =Egyptian protests= On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. Egypt's foreign minister later stated that \\"at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv.\\" Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmad Al-Shahhat, climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as \\"Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador\\" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy, drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz. =Israeli apology to Egypt= In October 2011, The New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. Official reactions ;Involved parties : * President Shimon Peres said \\"The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives\\" * Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a \\"serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed.\\" * Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated \\"this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements.\\" He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. \\"The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination.\\" He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. : * Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated \\"Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza.\\" Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is \\"against violence in all its forms,\\" however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as \\"a pretext for aggression.\\" * Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks \\"...since they were against soldiers.\\" Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. * Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: \\"The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems.\\" Tawheed and Jihad, an al-Qaeda-linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the \\"Jewish state should expect more.\\" Over the internet, the group said \\"We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine.\\" : * The Egyptian foreign ministry stated that \\"Egypt denounces the use of force against civilians in any circumstance and strongly advises Israel to immediately stop its military operations against Gaza\\". ; Supranational * – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, \\"the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint.\\" * – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said \\"I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured.\\" *The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern \\"about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation\\", and called for \\"restraint from all sides\\". ; International * – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: \\"We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table.\\" * – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: \\"“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” * – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace-loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. * – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: \\"At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East.\\" * – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the \\"barbaric\\" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: \\"I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today.\\" * – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks \\"in the strongest terms.\\" * – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre \\"condemned in the strongest possible terms\\" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror * – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that \\"I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends.\\" * – The State Department condemned the attacks \\"in the strongest terms,\\" calling the attack \\"brutal and cowardly.\\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said \\"We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always.\\" She also added that \\"This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution.\\" * – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and \\"reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends\\". He also said that \\"despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer\\". Impact Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. Investigation According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

Implementation of the BICI's recommendations  The BICI report gave a series of recommendations to the government of steps that it believed would improve accountability and bring government practice in line with international standards. The government gave itself a target of implementing these recommendations by the end of February 2012. The implementation progress of these recommendations is recorded on the govactions website. As far as the general recommendations are concerned, the government claims that it has implemented the following recommendations: * 1715: the implementation program. A royal order on 26 November 2011 established the implementation commission, which was independent and consisted of 19 members. * 1716: creating a government accountability mechanism. A team comprising Sir Daniel Bethlehem QC, Sir Jeffrey Jowell QC, Professor Adnan Amkhan, Professor Sarah Cleveland and David Perry QC provided their advice on the establishment of a Special Investigations Unit that is tasked with determining accountability. * 1717: to create an ombudsman at the Ministry of Interior and a police Code of Conduct. A decree establishing both the Ombudsman and the Internal Affairs department was issued on 28 February 2012. * 1718: reorganisation of the National Security Agency and National Safety situations. A decree on 28 November 2011 made the NSA an intelligence gathering agency with no law enforcement and arrest powers. In December 2011 the cabinet approved legislative amendments that ensure that arrests of persons will be in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure even in the state of national safety. * 1719: to undertake investigations into torture claims. On 8 January 2012, the Cabinet approved legislative amendments \\"that give the Attorney General the exclusive jurisdiction to investigate claims of torture and other forms of inhuman treatment\\"; and \\"protecting persons from any retribution for raising a claim of torture or other forms of cruel or inhuman treatment\\". Technical assistance is provided by the UNODC, amongst others. * 1720: to review all convictions and sentences rendered by the National Security Courts. All live cases are \\"being reviewed in the ordinary courts to ensure fair trial rights have been complied with in cases before the National Safety Courts (NSC)\\".

Rajab alleges that Bassiouni is \\"willing to espouse the view of the political establishment whilst paying lip- service to the concept of a fair and independent enquiry.\\" Rajab goes on to \\"seriously question the legitimacy of this commission and its ultimate findings\\".

Cherif Bassiouni \\"Reply of the Head of the Bahraini Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) to the BCHR Open Letter \\", Home Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, 9 August 2011 responded to Rajab's allegations in full, and described the BCHR's allegations that the BICI espouses the government's views as an \\"insult to the Commissioners and staff\\" of the BICI. He denied Rajab's allegation that the BICI had already reached any conclusions. Bassiouni continues by criticising the conclusions that Rajab drew from his Reuters interview, saying they are \\"premature\\", and admits to finding it \\"disheartening that you (Rajab) deemed it necessary to personally attack me\\". In a further statement published on the BICI website on 15 AugustBICI \\" Bahrain Commission of Inquiry Statement on events at their offices\\" , BICI, 15 August 2011 the BICI reiterated that it had not come to any conclusions in its investigations and, as a result of \\"misleading headlines\\" and the misrepresentation of Bassiouni's comments \\"by certain media outlets and activists\\", will no longer be giving interviews to the media.

This systematic practice ceased after 10 June, but detainees at other facilities continued to report incidents of mistreatment after that time.\\" *\\"the lack of accountability of officials within the security system in Bahrain has led to a culture of impunity, whereby security officials have few incentives to avoid mistreatment of prisoners or to take action to prevent mistreatment by other officials.\\" *\\"35 people were killed during the unrest, including 5 members of the security forces.\\" *\\"Sunnis were targeted by some demonstrators, either because they professed loyalty to the regime or on the basis of their sect. Sunnis were subjected to verbal abuse, physical attacks and attacks on their property as well as harassment... The Sunni community was seen as a target due to the perception that all Sunnis are agents or supporters of the GoB and the ruling family.\\" *\\"Some expatriates, particularly South Asian workers, were the targets of attacks during the events of February/March 2011.

He has opposed both Bashar al-Assad and Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi. Early life and background Al-Yaqoubi was born in Damascus, Syria. He comes from a family of Islamic scholars that traces its roots back to Morocco and has taught the Islamic sciences for centuries. His father, Ibrahim al-Yaqoubi (d. 1985) was a scholar. His paternal grandfather Ismail al-Yaqoubi (d. 1960) was a scholar and Sufi master. His father's maternal uncle was Arabi al-Yaqoubi (d. 1965), and his paternal uncle was Sharif al- Yaqoubi (d. 1943). Amongst al-Yaqoubi's predecessors three have held the post of Maliki Imam at the Grand Umayyad Mosque of Damascus. Al-Yaqoubi is a descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad,(ref:evidence of lineage) tracing his lineage through Mawlay Idris al-Anwar, (founder of the city of Fès), who was a descendant of Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad. Education Al- Yaqoubi's father took care of his upbringing, and he was both his teacher and spiritual master. His father gave him several ijazah, or certificates of authority to teach, narrate and issue legal rulings under Islamic law. Al- Yaqoubi also received training from his father in Sufism, until he attained qualification as a murshid and the rank of a spiritual master in the Sufi tradition. Al-Yaqoubi has also received ijazat from prominent scholars of Syria including: the Maliki Mufti of Syria, Makki al-Kittani; the Hanafi Mufti of Syria, Muhammad Abul Yusr Abidin; Ali al-Boudaylimi of Tlemcen, Abdul Aziz Uyun al-Sud, Salih al-Khatib, Zayn al-'Abideen at-Tounisi, Muhammad Wafa al- Qassaaband and Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri of Damascus. In 1987, al-Yaqoubi completed a degree in Arabic Literature at the University of Damascus within the Faculty of Islamic Law. Muhammad al-Yaqoubi He then studied philosophy for two years at the Beirut Arab University. In 1991, he joined the PhD program of linguistics in the Oriental Studies Department of the University of Gothenburg. In Sweden, he worked as a researcher and teacher of Arabic literature. In 1999, the Swedish Islamic Society appointed him mufti of Sweden. Al-Yaqoubi is \\"fluent in several languages including Arabic, English, and Swedish\\" http://sacredknowledge.co.uk/our-teachers/shaykh-muhammad-al- yaqoubi/ and sacred knowledge organisation states that he has trained several hundreds of scholars, imams and preachers Career Al-Yaqoubi started teaching Qur'an studies and recitation at the Darwishiyya Mosque at the age of 11. He delivered his first Friday sermon at the age of 14 at al-Saadaat Mosque, was appointed as Friday Imam and speaker (Khatib) at the age of 17 and was appointed as a teacher of Islamic studies at the age of 20. In the mid-2000s, al-Yaqoubi returned to Syria and began preaching been teaching the Islamic sciences such as Aqidah (Islamic theology), Tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis), Hadith (Prophetic tradition), Tasawwuf (Sciences of the heart), Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Usul (origins and fundamentals), Mustalah (hadith terminology), and Nahw (Arabic grammar). Al-Yaqoubi previously resided in Damascus and was a public teacher at institutions there. He taught Islamic theology at the Umayyad Mosque; and he held the position of Jumu'ah Khatib (Friday speaker) at the Jami' al-Hasan Mosque; at the Mosque of Ibn Arabi, he taught from al-Risalah of Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri and Shamaail Tirmidhi of Tirmidhi. He was a public speaker in both Arabic and English. In June 2011, al-Yaqoubi was forced into exile by the Assad government and moved to Morocco. Al-Yaqoubi is currently writing, publishing new works and continuing to teach under Sacred Knowledge, an initiative dedicated to the spreading of orthodox Islam.http://sacredknowledge.co.uk Involvement in the Syrian Revolution 2011–present In April 2011, al-Yaqoubi was one of the first Sunni clerics to express his support for the Syrian uprising and condemn the Syrian government's response to peaceful demonstrations. In August 2011, the BBC reported that al-Yaqoubi had called for more international pressure on the government of Syria after Government forces renewed their crackdown on protesters. He was forced into exile in 2011. Despite other leading scholars initially calling for minor reforms, al-Yaqoubi was early to demand the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Yaqoubi initially fully supported Kofi Annan's \\"Six-point plan\\" urging for \\"international pressure on Russia and China\\" to force the end of the conflict in Syria. He advocates the establishment of a democratic free state in Syria alongside championing the \\"vital role\\" of the Islamic scholar in preventing the break-up of Syrian society after the fall of Assad. As the conflict has protracted, al-Yaqoubi publicly urged Jordan and Turkey to intervene militarily in Syria \\"to save the Syrian people\\", voicing frustration at the failure of the international community to intervene. In addition, he believes that any intervention will be undertaken by the United Nations, NATO, or the United States because it's \\"more realistic\\". Al-Yaqoubi has been an active participant in the political process to form a credible political alternative to the Assad government. However, due to political intrigue, his appointment to be a full member of the Syrian National Council was blocked almost as soon as it was to be formally confirmed. Since the start of the Syrian uprising, al-Yaqoubi has campaigned internationally to provide humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees. In December 2012, he led a convoy for the delivery of \\"vast quantities of food, baby food and blankets\\" to displaced Syrians in Turkey. Consequently, he fled the country after the Syrian regime tried to silence him after he publicly criticised the ruling Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, calling on the president to step down and supporting the Syrian uprising. He is currently in exile in Morocco, helping to deliver humanitarian aid, and is in regular contact with Syrian fighters who consult him on the moral and spiritual issues raised by their struggle. After his exile from Syria, he has taken part in a sustained international effort to provide aid for the Syrian people. He has publicly urged the international community to \\"implement help immediately\\" and to \\"lift the siege\\" on Syria in an interview with Sky News. In August 2013, al-Yaqoubi said he wants the Free Syrian Army (FSA) to open a register in which fighters, civilians and administrators can be organized and given an identification number. He also thinks there should be recruitment centers in major towns and cities in the Middle East to pre-empt individual efforts, where those who want to fight can be vetted and trained under the FSA 's supervision. In September 2014, al-Yaqoubi co-signed an open letter to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi saying \\"misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder\\" and refuting the ideological foundation of ISIS, banning Muslims from joining it and making it clear that this is non-Islamic, anti-Islam. In November 2014, he led prayers at the funeral of the American Peter Kassig. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour he condemned the killing of Kassig by ISIL and said, \\"We have to speak loud and very clear that Muslims and Islam have nothing to do with this... ISIS has no nationality. Its nationality is terror, savagery, and hatred.\\" In the same month in an interview with Margaret Warner on PBS NewsHour he said of al-Baghdadi, \\"He's against Islam. He's non-Muslim, according to the Muslim standards, because he's allowing people to kill Muslims, referring to the Book of Allah [Quran], wrongly using religious texts. This is anti-Islamic. He's going against God. He's going against the message of Islam, Muhammad, peace be upon him. If he repents and come in a court and defend himself, he won't have any one single verse of the Quran to defend his opinion in killing innocent people.\\" In March 2015, he said that ISIL has a sophisticated system of fallacies, and he referred to the extremists as \\"ignorant\\", \\"stupid\\" and \\"arrogant\\". Views On 22 January 2010, al-Yaqoubi refuted the comments made by Mufti of Syria Ahmad Bader Hassoun on 19 January 2010 about the Prophet Muhammad. Al-Ya'qoubi explained the necessity to obey the Messenger in every command including the news about the Qur'an and the names of the prophets. Al-Ya'qoubi asserted, \\"we know that Moses and Jesus are prophets only because our Prophet Muhammad told us so. Had he told us otherwise, we would have had to believe him...believing in Moses and Jesus does not imply the validity of Judaism and Christianity of today.\\" He also asked Mufti Hassoun to resign his job out of embarrassment and to protect the dignity of Islam and the integrity of the Islamic scholars of Syria. The following day al-Yaqoubi was dismissed as Friday public speaker of al-Hasan Masjid in Abu Rummaneh, Damascus by the government. Six months later he was re-instated. On 21 June 2010, al-Yaqoubi declared on Takbeer TV's programme Sunni Talk that the Mujaddid of the Indian subcontinent was Ahmed Raza Khan, and said that a follower of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah can be identified by his love of Khan, and that those outside of that those outside the Ahlus Sunnah are identified by their attacks on him. On 18 August 2011, al-Yaqoubi led prayers from a stage in Summerfield Park, Winson Green, Birmingham to some 20,000 people who gathered to remember three men killed while attempting to protect their neighbourhood from rioters and looters during the England riots. At the ceremony he said that \\"they made themselves an example of what a Muslim should be and what Islam is\\" and that \\"these three people are martyrs and the best we can do for them is to pray for them and for ourselves - to pray for our community.\\" He asked for 18 August to be made a \\"day not of mourning and sadness but a day of bravery.\\"< Al-Yaqoubi had been a critic of Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti's stance of supporting the Syrian government. However, after Al-Bouti's assassination on 21 March 2013, al- Yaqoubi claimed that Al-Bouti was a martyr and that he had been privately readying to defect from the Syrian government. In August 2013, al-Yaqoubi said: \\"Animosity against a state cannot be declared by individuals or groups; no Islamic government is in a state of war with the UK; they all have diplomatic relations and therefore, any attack against UK citizens or interests would be deemed as un-Islamic and illegal in the Shari’a, regardless of whether we approve of UK policies or not, or its government\\". In the April 2016 issue of Dabiq Magazine, The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared him a murtadd (or apostate). Recognition In 2012, al-Yaqoubi was listed in The 500 Most Influential Muslims by Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding and the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan as well as being listed in the honourable mentions in both 2015 and 2016 Personal life In 1985, al-Yaqoubi's father, Ibrahim al-Yaqoubi, died. In 2006, al-Yaqoubi's first wife, Farizah, died in a car accident, he personally wrote a eulogy on an online obituary in which he stated that she used to pray 100 rak’as of salah everyday.

It comprises 8 species growing in Central Africa. Description The main characters of Globulostylis are the few-flowered inflorescences with a pair of bracts at the apex of the peduncle and the style with a swelling in the lower half. Distribution and habitat Globulostylis has 8 species in Central Africa, all endemic to the Lower Guinean forests, except G. uncinula, which also occurs in the Congolian forests. All species are shrubs or small trees of forest understory, never gregarious. Bacterial leaf symbiosis Endophytic bacteria are housed in the intercellular space of the leaf mesophyll tissue. The presence of these bacteria can only be microscopically ascertained. The bacteria are identified as Burkholderia, which is a genus that is also found in the leaves of other Rubiaceae species. hypothesis is that these endophytic bacteria provide chemical protection against insect herbivory. Taxonomy The genus was described by H.F. Wernham in 1913 to accommodate two species from South Nigeria collected by Mr. and Mrs. P.A. Talbot, viz. G. minor and G. talbotii. A third species, G. cuvieroides, was added later. Globulostylis and Cuviera species are closely related, and therefore at one point Globulostylis was treated as a subgenus of Cuviera. However, the combined analysis of both morphological and molecular data separates both genera.

The pose of the Venus resembles the classical statues of the Venus de' Medici in Florence or the Capitoline Venus in Rome, which Titian may have seen when he wrote that was \\"learning from the marvelous ancient stones.\\" The painting is said to celebrate the ideal beauty of the female form, or to be a critique of vanity, or perhaps both.Site of the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. It was copied by several later artists, including Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck.Peter Humfrey (2007), p. 322. Titian made a number of paintings of the same subject, but this is believed to be the earliest and the only version to be entirely by the hand of Titian, without additions by his assistants. it remained in his house until his death in 1576. Painting, and versions X-rays of the painting have revealed that Titian painted it over a double portrait which he had abandoned. Titian kept the red cloak of one of the figures in the abandoned painting and placed it under Venus's arm.Shapley, F.R. \\"Titian's Venus with a Mirror\\" – Studies in the History of Art. 4–5, 1971–72. pp. 93–106. The use of the cloak from the earlier painting probably played a large part in the composition of the new painting. Titian is believed to have made another version of this Venus for the Venetian lawyer Niccolo Crasso, who also commissioned Titian to paint the Retable of Saint Nicholas de Bari at about the same time. A drawing of the other version was included by Anthony van Dyck in the sketchbook made during his trip to Italy. This other version is now lost, but a studio copy exists in the Hermitage Museum. Titian is thought to have made a second copy, which was sent to his regular patron King Philip II of Spain, in 1567. This version was also lost, but a copy of it by Peter Paul Rubens exists, which is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid.

In 1850 the Russian Consul- General in Venice, A. Kvostov, purchased the painting, along with a large number of other masterpieces, from the Barbarigo family, for Czar Nicholas I for the sum of 525,000 francs, and it entered the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.Nicholas Ilyin, Natalia Semenova, (2000), Prodanniy Sokrovischye Rossiyi, p. 174 In 1931, in order to earn foreign currency for the first of the Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet government secretly sold the painting, along with a number of other masterpieces, to a syndicate of art dealers, who sold it to the American collector Andrew Mellon, who wished to create a national art museum for the United States. Mellon donated it to the United States Government in 1937.See Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings. It was one of the first masterpieces to be displayed in the National Gallery of Art in Washington when it opened in 1941. Works that may have influenced Titian Woman with a Mirror, by Giovanni Bellini (1515). Titian had worked as a pupil in the studio of Bellini, and adopted Bellini's rich and sensuous colors. The pose of the painting may have been influenced by Ancient Greek and Roman statues of Venus Titian could have seen in Rome and Florence. He was also influenced by his teacher Giovanni Bellini, who was the leader of the Venetian school of painters, known for their masterful use of color. Influence of the painting The theme of the painting was adapted by a number of later artists, including Peter Paul Rubens and Diego Velázquez. The painting itself was the inspiration for the protagonist Severin's imagination in the 1870 novel Venus in Furs by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Gallery, influences File:Venus de Medici.pngA work that may have influenced Titian is Venus de' Medici in the Uffizi gallery in Florence File:Capitoline Venus - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016.jpgAnother work that may have influenced Titian is Capitoline Venus at the Capitoline Museums in Rome File:Rubens Venus at a Mirror c1615.jpgVenus at a Mirror by Peter Paul Rubens (1615).

Using the SMK method, a prosthetic tooth is constructed and fitted without damage to the neighbouring teeth.  Description of method  In the SMK method, the dentist models and shapes a tooth from composite materials and fits it in the interdental gap to be filled. In some cases a porcelain veneer is then placed on the new tooth to give it a more natural look. The tooth is attached to the neighbouring teeth also with composite materials. In 2011 over 1000 SMK treatments were performed,Data obtained by the author during medical research, consultations with orthodontists and performing SMK treatment on patients by the author of the method. mostly on the lateral incisors. The main advantage of this method is that there is no grinding of neighbouring teeth, so that the neighbouring teeth are not damaged. This means that the patient can at any time revert to their natural teeth. This method can also be used in situations where other techniques are not applicable: for example, if there is not enough bone and implants cannot be inserted, or the grinding and damaging of neighbouring teeth for a normal dental bridge is not accepted by the patient, or the cost of alternative treatments is too high for the patient. The dentist makes the tooth in the surgery (a dental technician is not needed), and the treatment is completed in approximately two hours.  History  In 1992, the first SMK treatment was performed in the Orthodontic Department of the Pomeranian Medical School in Szczecin, Poland, by C. Turostowski. At the beginning it was treated as a temporary solution. However, after seven years, due to continuing research the SMK method became increasingly used as a permanent option. In June 1999, Turostowski completed his Ph.D., \\"SMK – composite bridge of own construction applied in the rebuilding of lateral incisors\\". Initially, SMK treatment was applied with orthodontic patients with missing lateral incisors. Later, it was applied to patients with other missing teeth, especially premolars. In some cases SMK was used together with veneers so as to give it a more cosmetic and natural look. Shortly afterwards SMK was introduced for use not only with orthodontics patients but also with other dental patients.

The impact sourcing sector focuses on utilizing workers from poor and vulnerable communities to perform functions with lower and moderate skill requirements such as scanning documents, data entry work, data verification and cleaning, video tagging, and microwork.  The BPO sector  Business process outsourcing (BPO) refers to the outsourcing of certain business processes (i.e. informational and transaction services) to third- party service providers. This business has grown over the past two decades to a hundred billion-dollar sector that directly impacts both international trade and the global economy. Growth in the BPO sector has been driven by five mega- trends:Kennedy, Robert. The Services Shift: Seizing the Ultimate Offshore Opportunity, FT Press, 2009. https://www.amazon.com/Services-Shift-Ultimate- Offshore-Opportunity/dp/0137133502 * Global macroeconomic liberalization * The digitization of business processes * Technological innovations and the adoption of technology * Growing worldwide capabilities * Global business culture Growth is likely to continue because the majority of these drivers are unlikely to reverse. The global estimate for the BPO sector as high as $574 billion by 2015.Accenture. Exploring the Value Proposition for Impact for Impact Sourcing, October 2012. http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insight- exploring-value-proposition-impact-sourcing.aspx Developing countries have particularly benefited from the growth of the BPO sector, generating exports and millions of jobs. Leading centers for BPO include India, the Philippines, China, and South Africa.  Origins  Impact sourcing first evolved as a new sub-sector of the BPO industry in India as rising costs in urban centers forced many BPO companies to focus on higher end services such as voice. New BPO companies sprang up in rural India where they enjoyed both lower costs and attrition rates. Those BPOs, such as RuralShores, employed high school graduates and university students from agrarian, low-income families. Another example is Vindhya Info based out of Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, whose work force is 85% PWD (People with disabilities). In 2008, the South African government launched the Monyetla Work Readiness Program in which over 1,000 unemployed youth, mostly high school graduates, were trained for work in the country's BPO sector; over 77% of the trainees found employment.Offshoring South Africa on the Monyetla Work Readiness Program, \\"Stepping Stone to Employment\\", March 2011.  Support  In 2010, The Rockefeller Foundation launched an initiative focused on poverty reduction through employment to further its core activities related to supporting \\"sustainable livelihoods\\" among poor and vulnerable populations. The Monitor Group and Rockefeller Foundation, borrowing from impact investing terminology, formally coined the term \\"impact sourcing\\" in a 2011 report that focused on the beneficial job creation aspect of the BPO industry.Monitor Inclusive Markets. Job Creation Through Build the Field of Impact Sourcing, June 2011. http://www.monitor.com/Portals/0/MonitorContent/imported/MonitorUnitedStates/Articles/PDFs/Monitor_Job_Creation_Through_Building_the_Field_of_Impact_Sourcing_6_16_11.pdf  Impact sourcing service providers (ISSPs)  Impact sourcing service providers (ISSPs) are a group of organizations within the BPO sector that operate with a set of refer to BPO organizations with the specific social objectives. Many of these firms have, as an explicit part of their often defined in their mission, an objective to generate employment for and upgrade the skills of hire workers from poor and vulnerable communities to perform BPO work.  Value proposition  Impact sourcing is viewed as an effective market-based solution to poverty alleviation and shows the potential to create millions of jobs for the young and those living in poverty. Monitor Inclusive Markets. Promise and Progress: Market-Based Solutions to Poverty in Africa, May 2011. http://www.monitor.com/Expertise/BusinessIssues/EconomicDevelopmentandSecurity/tabid/69/ctl/ArticleDetail/mid/705/CID/2011230515191415/CTID/1/L/en- US/Default.aspx While long-term studies have yet to take place, impact sourcing has begun to demonstrate positive impacts on multiple aspects of well-being for workers and their families. Studies indicate that impact sourcing employees benefit with income increases of anywhere from 40 percent to 200 percent. Employment in Impact Sourcing also serves as initial entry point into the formal economy, which leads to valuable job experience that can help workers pay their way through school, receive higher education and move towards better careers. Impact sourcing also has the potential to benefit traditional BPO service providers, who are actively seeking alternate lower- cost destinations (i.e. smaller cities and/or rural towns) and pools of new and more affordable qualified workers. While the potential benefits of impact sourcing are compelling, the sector faces challenges that have prevented it from reaching its full potential. These obstacles include the ability of ISSPs to secure new work and clients, as well as the ability for ISSPs to partner with and sub-contract for larger, more traditional BPO service providers.  Market size  Impact sourcing is considered to be in its early stage of development. The current market size is estimated at $4.5 billion, which represents about 4 percent of the $119 billion BPO industry. BPOBornstein, David. Workers of the World, Employed, New York Times, November 3rd, 2011.http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/workers-of-the-world- employed/ Impact Sourcing directly employs approximately 144,000 people across all segments. Some estimate that Impact Sourcing has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2015, employing 780,000 socioeconomically disadvantaged people globally. Avasant estimates that the market has the ability to grow to represent twenty three percent of the total BPO industry by 2020.Avasant.

There are 10 serotypes recognised and the virus had a worldwide distribution—being particularly common in Africa and Central America. Infection usually results in disease of the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract. Infection may also cause ocular or generalised signs and may contribute to enzootic pneumonia, depending on the serotype of the virus. However, infection may not always result in disease as the virus can be isolated in healthy cattle. Once infected, the cattle shed the virus for approximately 10 days in the respiratory secretions or feces—some cattle may become persistently infected, resulting in excretion of the virus for much longer. Clinical Signs & Diagnosis Clinical signs are more common in younger animals as the levels of maternal antibodies begin to wane, from as young as two weeks old. Gastrointestinal signs include diarrhoea, a reduced appetite and abdominal distension. Respiratory signs include coughing, serous nasal discharge, dyspnea and tachypnea. Signs may worsen if a secondary infection occurs. The classical signs of a generalised disease, such as pyrexia, weight loss, depression, weakness, lymphadenopathy and lethargy may also be seen. Sudden death is also reported. Definitive diagnosis can only be achieved by measuring a fourfold rise in antibody titre over the course of the disease. Presence of the virus alone cannot confirm diagnosis due to its presence in healthy cattle. Virus isolation is the only way to identify the serotype of the adenovirus. Postmortem examination may reveal lesions in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract and enlarged lymph nodes. Treatment & Control Cattle should be treated symptomatically when possible. Antibiotic treatment may also be indicated to prevent secondary infection. The disease can be controlled by ensuring that calves receive adequate colostrum at birth. Management factors such as separating different age groups, and providing good ventilation and clean bedding also reduce disease incidence. Vaccination of young cattle can reduce the severity and incidence of disease. Multiple doses are required and are usually combined with other agents. The vaccine is not available worldwide.

Founded in 1943, Canning House serves as a forum for debate and discussion of the current affairs of the region. History Canning House is named after George Canning (1770–1827), British Foreign Secretary between 1807-1809 and 1822-1827, and briefly Prime Minister in 1827. Canning was a prominent advocate of the emerging republics in early Latin America and is a recognized figure in the region with several streets bearing his name. Canning House first came into being in 1943 with the creation of the Hispanic Council and the Luso-Brazilian Council simultaneously. Following the end of the Second World War, both councils were merged and the resulting entity was commonly referred to as Canning House. In 1973 the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Council was registered as a limited company, and in 1997 Canning House was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary. Initial meetings took place at the Shell-Mex House before offices were set up in Berkeley Street in 1947. From 1953 until 2018 Canning House was based in Belgrave Square before moving to 126 Wigmore Street, where it can be found today. Focus Areas Canning House has a number of areas including Trade & Investment, Government & Policy, Education, Research and Culture. In the area of Trade & Investment, Canning House takes an active role in encouraging links between the UK and Latin America. It holds several events each year discussing the opportunities available across many sectors and informing British businesses about the Latin American market. This ranges from hosting trade missions from countries such as Bolivia, to holding conferences on the Biofuel industry in Latin America, as well as smaller, focused policy roundtables with key figures from selected industries. Canning House has served as secretariat for the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) meetings on Latin America since 2015, and has contributed to parliamentary papers examining the UK’s relationship with Latin American nations. Each year Canning House holds the Canning Lecture, a series of lectures presented by visiting heads of state in which they offer their perspective on UK-Latin America relations and explore possible avenues for cooperation in the future. Previous figures to have given lectures include former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet, the President of Colombia Ivan Duque, and former President of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 2010, then-Foreign Secretary William Hague became the first British Foreign Secretary to give the Canning Lecture, renamed in that year as the Canning Agenda. In it, he set out the government’s foreign policy agenda with a renewed focus on Latin America, outlining a desire to increase trade and encourage British businesses to explore the region in the context of an increasingly globalized world economy. Structure Canning House operates a membership system that includes both Individual and Corporate membership offerings. Individual and Public members are given access to Canning House newsletters, Canning Insights and to Geopolitical, Cultural, Flagship and Business, Trade and Investment events at a discount, while Corporate members have full access to all Canning House events and publications References External links *Official Website *The Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Council at Open Charities Charities based in London ","title":"Canning House"},{"id":"32787451","text":"The WACO primary glider or simply WACO glider, was an early product of the Waco Aircraft Company.

In 2010 the organisation began engagement with the Liberal Democrats in light of the formation of the Coalition Government The Enterprise Forum is run by an unpaid board of senior directors drawn from business and industry. The organisation does not take a position on policy, and does not donate to or receive donations from any Political Party.  History  The Enterprise Forum was founded in 1997 by Andrew Cumpsty and Alistair Burt through a desire to ensure business involvement in the Conservative Party's policy development. Its aim is to improve the quality and flow of information between the business community and the Conservative Party. Alistair Burt was the first Chairman of the Enterprise Forum. The Chairman is Andrew Cumpsty who took over from Alistair Burt due to his re-election to Parliament in 2001. The first formal meeting, held in Autumn 1997, by the Enterprise Forum was with Peter Lilley MP, the then Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party. Since that time the Enterprise Forum has had virtually every front bench Conservative Politician speak at one of its meetings.  Liberal Democrats  A decision by the Board of Directors, after the May 2010 General Election and the formation of the Coalition Government, was that the programme of events should also include Liberal Democrat MPs. The first Liberal Democrat to speak at an Enterprise Forum event was Steve Webb MP, Minister of State for Pensions. The meeting was held on the one year anniversary of the Coalition (12 May 2011).  Membership and meetings  The Enterprise Forum’s members are businesses and organisations that want to engage on policy with the Coalition Government or before 2010, the Conservative Party. Membership includes commercial organisations (including FTSE 100 companies and SME’s), trade associations and charities. The programme of events is determined by the policy priorities of the member organisations. All meetings are held under the Chatham House Rules. Additionally, the Forum also engages with key policy stakeholders outside of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Parties. These have included Director Generals at the CBI, Deputy Governors at The Bank of England and the First Minister of Northern Ireland.  European Parliament Representatives  Giles Chichester MEP and Malcolm Harbour MEP are the representatives for The Enterprise Forum in The European Parliament. The Enterprise Forum holds regular European Parliament update meetings in London.  President, vice presidents and alumni  The President of the Enterprise Forum is The Lord MacLaurin of Knebworth DL. Vice- Presidents of the Enterprise Forum are Alistair Burt MP (Founder and former Chairman of the Enterprise Forum), David Gauke MP, Malcolm Harbour MEP, Margot James MP and Mark Prisk MP. Former directors of the Enterprise Forum that have gone on to become MPs are David Gauke MP, Stephen Barclay MP, Oliver Colvile MP and Laura Sandys MP.

Valerian Maykov, once a Petrashevsky Circle associate, was considered by contemporaries as heir to Vissarion Belinsky's position of Russia's leading critic, and later credited for being arguably the first in Russia to introduce scientific approach to the art of literary criticism.  Biography  Valerian Maykov, son of painter Nikolay Maykov, was born in Moscow and received a high-quality home education: Ivan Goncharov, the family's friend, taught him Russian language and literature. He studied in the Saint Petersburg University and later cited professor Viktor Poroshin who taught political economy as a major influence. In his first article, called \\"Productivity as Related to Wealth Distribution\\" (1842), he critically analyzed Adam Smith's theory and suggested an idea of workers' receiving shares of the profit. In 1842 Maykov graduated from the university and joined the governmental Department of Agriculture. Soon he quit it due to ill health and spent half a year in Germany, France and Switzerland, where he studied extensively political economy, philosophy and chemistry. On his return to Saint Petersburg, Maykov became close to the Petrashevsky circle and took part in compiling the so-called Pocket Dictionary of Foreign Words Now Part of the Russian Language (1845–46) along with N.Kirillov and Mikhail Petrashevsky himself. There he wrote some major articles: \\"Analysis\\", \\"Criticism\\", \\"Ideal\\", \\"Drama\\", \\"Journal\\". The Kirillov's Dictionary, the most obvious result of French Revolution influence (and an analogue of Voltaire's Philosophy Dictionary), in the late 1840s was banned and put out of circulation. In 1849 Ivan Liprandi who investigated the Petrashevsky case, was saying that the dictionary \\"was full of such daring things which were worse than those in hand-written copies that were circulating around\\". In 1845 Maykov became a co-editor of the Finsky vestnik (The Finnish Herald) magazine, founded by Fyodor Dershau. The first volume of it opened with Maykov's large (unfinished) article \\"Social Sciences in Russia\\" in which he formulated the main thesis of his whole literary legacy: the need for science and arts to be organically linked with social reality. The second part of the article was to be a critical analysis of \\"the progressive thought in Russia,\\" focusing on Vissarion Belinsky, but got banned and later appeared in miscellaneous fragments. Maykov's article has been noticed in literary circles, and in 1846 Andrey Krayevsky (on Ivan Turgenev's recommendation) invited Maykov to become an editor of critical department of Otechestvennye Zapiski, where Belinsky worked. In his first major article, on poet Aleksey Koltsov, Maykov came into direct conflict with Belinsky, accusing him of \\"biased and unfounded criticism\\" and \\"literary dictatorship\\". Belinsky's reply was harsh and this made the relationship between Otechestvennye Zapisky and Sovremennik, a Belinsky circle's unofficial base, strained. In spite of this Maykov in 1847 started to collaborate with Sovremennik. The same year he organised his own circle, close to that of Petrashevsky, with Vladimir Milyutin and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin among its members. By this time Maykov's philosophy changed: inspired by Ludwig Feuerbach and Western Socialists he came up with his own concept of \\"harmonical man\\" and \\"ideal civilisation\\", seeing, among other things, national and ethnic differences as totally superfluous. Valerian Maykov’s promising career suddenly came to an end on July 15, 1847. While guesting in Petergof region, he died of a stroke while swimming. He was buried in a village graveyard of Ropsha nearby Saint Petersburg.  Legacy  After a barrage of obituaries all mourning Russian literature's heavy loss there came ten years of oblivion. In 1861 Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote warmly of Maykov's short legacy, then in 1868 Ivan Turgenev published a piece on him in his Literary Memoirs. In 1972 the magazine Otechestvennye Zapisky published a major analysis of Maykov's works. Critics argued, though, that the author, Aleksander Skabichevsky greatly exaggerated the degree of disagreement between him and Belinsky. In 1886 a large article by K. K. Arsentyev on Maykov and his political activities was published by Vestnik Evropy. The years 1891 and 1892 saw a renewed interest in Maykov's set of ideas when A. N. Tchudinov published in Literary Pantheon (Пантеон Литературы) his Critical Exercises (Критические опыты), which inspired a lively discussion in Vestnik Evropy, Russkaya Mysl and Istorichesky Vestnik magazines. Later a large article on this work was published by Akim Volynsky in his Russian Critics series. According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, Maykov \\"wasn't a gifted writer in the common sense of the word,\\" his style of writing was \\"anemic and occasionally murky\\", his analysis of Herzen and Tyutchev's works not original. Yet author Semyon Vengerov credited Maykov with being arguably the first \\"theoretical\\" critic in Russia who, unlike most of his colleagues, was interested not so much in analysis of particular literary works as with the way these works fitted into his own \\"rather neat and elaborate aesthetic theory\\".

CMIC was founded by Eleanor de Leon-Llenado. History The grade school was opened in 1979 with an initial enrolment of 29 pupils. Thenceforth, the school population and school building facilities steadily grew. In 1985, the school opened its High School Department with only 15 students. Four years later, the school graduated its first batch of 19 pioneers at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima with the NCR chief of secondary schools, Dr. Pilar Pascual, as guest of honor. For eight consecutive years, the High School Department took pride in the 100% passing of students in the National Secondary Aptitude Test (NSAT) formerly the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE). In 1995, the College Department was opened with an enrollment of 50 students. The department initially offered the following degree programs: Bachelor of arts, bachelor of elementary education, bachelor of secondary education, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in computer and the two–year program, associate in computer technology. To date, the College Department maintains the offering of bachelor's degrees in education, for elementary and high school and bachelor of science in commerce. The rest have been gradually phased out. By the opening of school year 1999–2000, CMIC has become a La Salle Consultancy School with a La Salle Brother, Narciso Erquiza, FSC, as its superintendent and Rommel Salvador as its supervisor. In the school year 2000–2001, Salvador was replaced by Judith Aldaba from the De La Salle University and Dr. Victoria Honrada, from De La Salle Zobel School, became CMIC ‘s school head. In the school year 2001–2002, three LASSO supervisors, namely Christopher Polanco, Rommel Sanchez and Sister Teresita Octavio, assisted the school in the preparation for the first–step LASSO accreditation. Gloria Faraon for the College Department and Sonia Annang spearheaded the executive committee for the Grade School and High School Departments. Recommendations were made for further evaluations. A second LASSO accreditation was made the following year. This time, the executive committee was chaired by then school head, Eleanor de Leon–Llenado. The school passed the first phase of the and became a De La Salle Supervised School.

There are also a number of self-portraits on black chalk and paper. See Rosand, 66 The other is in Madrid, dated c. 1560. Both share a somber and reserved pallet, although this example is richer in tonal variation and colour harmonisation.Phillips, 183 It is unfinished, with his left hand, areas of his clothing only sketched and only roughly sketched. It has been suggested that the canvas is a modello, or study, for another now lost work.\\"Self-portrait\\". Museo del Prado. Retrieved 19 August 2017 Another theory is that it was painted for family members for his memory after he died. Thematically and stylistically, the work can be associated with his 1545 Portrait of Pietro Aretino. A number of versions or variants exist, including drawings from his own hand, and paintings attributed to his workshop. Origin and purpose Parts of the canvas are unfinished, especially the hands, the dark area around his face, and the drapery. It remained in Titian's studio in the Biri Grande, Venice, until his death, which some art historian see as evidence that it was intended as a study,Nichols, 183 although it may just have been simply because it was unfinished.Nichols, 229 The Italian painter, architect, and writer Giorgio Vasari wrote in 1568 that Titian had made a number of self-portraits for his family to remember him by, and it is likely that this was one, given that it was not sold in his lifetime. However Vasari dates the portrait to c. 1562-64, this work more closely corresponds to a records of a version of a portrait given to Paolo Giovio in 1549. Description The painting's style is reminiscent of Titian's work of around 1560, especially the thick and irregular application of white paint in large sections. He seems to be around 60 years old, giving credence to the earlier dating. He wears the golden chain of the Order of the Golden Spur, wrapped in three strands, which was given to him by the Emperor Charles V in 1533.Richter, 167 The chain is intended to signify his knighthood and elevated social status.Partridge, 236 He wears a black cap in both paintings; a motif seen a number of other of his later works. While the origins of the motif are unknown, it is probably intend to connect him with scholarship; similar headgear is often associated with Aristotle and St Jerome. A further explanation is that he sough to cover up a bald spot. Self- Portrait (c. 1567), oil on canvas, 86 cm × 65 cm. Museo del Prado, Madrid The portrait is in half length, with Titian in three-quarters profile view, seated behind a table, looking out into the distance.Rosand, 65 Although his expression is complex and hard to properly interpret, it can be viewed as a more outward looking and optimistic expression the 1567 Madrid self- portrait,Nichols, 166 and a number of art historians note the aging and physical decline he had undergone by the time of the later work.Tsaneva As with all of his independent self-portraits, he is looking to the side, avoiding the viewer, possibly out of humility, but in a dignified pose. He is shown with strong shoulders and a keen, alert gaze, in which some detect an air \\"of combativeness...disquietude...and misgiving\\". Unlike the Madrid canvas, the portrait does not refer to his occupation as a painter, although art historian David Rosand believes that \\"instead of an implement of his craft, however, the open brushwork itself declares the painter's art\\". Further, the emphasis on his hands may reference that as a painter his talent derived from them. That the canvas is unfinished gives insight into Titian's working methods and techniques.

Its name is derived from Old English fūle[n] ēa, meaning “dirty water”. Maintenance responsibilities for the river transferred from the Environment Agency to the Market Weighton Drainage Board on 1 October 2011. Market Weighton Drainage Board subsequently amalgamated with the Lower Ouse Internal Drainage Board on 1 April 2012 to create the Ouse and Humber Drainage Board. The river discharges into the Humber Estuary via Market Weighton Canal. Water levels within the river, its tributaries and the canal are managed and controlled by the Environment Agency. The river lies in an area known as the Humberhead Levels. Course The river rises in the fields north-west of the village of Shiptonthorpe which is close to the town of Market Weighton. It flows south through the village and then heads west south-west towards Holme- on-Spalding-Moor. Circumnavigating the town, the river then turns back in a south-easterly direction until it joins the Market Weighton Canal just north of the M62. Natural history The majority of the area is farmland with large rectangular fields bounded by hedgerow, mainly hawthorn with blackthorn; dog rose; elder and hazel, with very few areas of woodland. This area would have been marshland before the introduction of the drainage system and the Market Weighton Canal. Wildlife surveys of the river show evidence of European water vole, European otter, freshwater mussel and many amphibians. Geology The river flows over several soil types including Loam, Sand and Alluvium. There are over of drainage ditches that feed into the river, but few natural tributaries. History The river valley has been populated since Palaeolithic times with many artefacts from that age being unearthed by archeologists. Remains from Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman times have also been found by various digs in the area. Economy The area surrounding the river is almost totally agricultural. Leisure There are very few Public Rights of Way in the river valley. It is not crossed by many roads and there are few major settlements; therefore, leisure activity is limited mainly to angling.

It takes place at the theme park's International Street at approximately 10:00 pm during the regular park season. The show was introduced to the theme park in 2011 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. It has also played during the 2012, 2016, and 2019 regular park seasons. Canada's Wonderland stated that the total cost for the opening season was approximately one million dollars with 16 million different colours and 300,000 LED lights. Wonder Mountain, the primary symbol of the park, is the focus of the show as lighting effects are projected onto its surface with many colours and 3D effects. The show was created and designed by Tantrum Design for its first two seasons, with subsequent work by the park's production team in cooperation with the companies that supplied new lighting and fountain equipment. Description Starlight Spectacular is one of a number of outdoor shows presented at International Street, the main promenade of Canada's Wonderland between the theme park's entrance and Wonder Mountain. Running the length of International Street is a water basin, known as Royal Fountain, which has hundreds of programmable water jets. The sound-and-light show is performed in the evening at approximately 10 pm (weather permitting), and acts to guide visitors for the park's daily closing. Performances project light shows onto Wonder Mountain and the programmable water jets of Royal Fountain, accompanied by music and sound effects. The images projected were precisely mapped for the dimensions and contours of the mountain. The apparatus for the show is also used during the Halloween Haunt season, in which effects are intermittently projected onto Wonder Mountain. Starlight Spectacular was first presented in the 2011 season for the park's 30th anniversary. =Original production= Starlight Spectacular played in four scenes, fading to darkness inbetween. The first scene has a theme of the seasons, beginning with images of maple leaves (a national symbol of Canada) blowing around Wonder Mountain, then falling snowflakes and effects which made Wonder Mountain appear to be frozen. The snow then began to disappear and plants grew, and a rainbow and butterflies appeared around the mountain. The second scene begins with lightning effects and parts of the mountain appearing to explode and release lava. One lightning strike opens a large cave in the mountain; a dragon- or dinosaur-like creature emerges, roars, and blows fire which covers the entire mountain. The third scene features geometric displays with 3D effects, in which images of white, blue, green, and red cubes and squares of various sizes move and interact. An optical illusion then made the mountain appear to move up and down, left and right, and tilt. Cubes reappeared, moving in all directions, followed by coloured strings. The mountain then seems to collapse. In the fourth scene, the peaks of the mountain are lit to visibility one by one, and appear to be moving in rhythm with mechanical sounds. Images of rotating gears are then projected on the lower portions of the mountain, giving the impression of a giant machine. The mountain peaks move faster as the gears grow larger. Lights seem to shoot out of the gears and fly around the mountain, leaving string- like trails. Smaller lights appeared descending down the mountain. Water jets synchronize with the accompanying music, which grows in intensity. Blue lights then appear on the mountain's two largest waterfalls, with jellyfish-like images beside them. Vibrant rainbow colours flash across the mountain, then imitate the four waterfalls. The image of a giant disco ball appears, seeming to flash coloured spots before falling down the mountain. Circles and stars fly around the mountain, followed by animated fireworks and balloons. The dinosaur reappears wearing a party hat and dances, and the words \\"Happy 30th Birthday Canada's Wonderland\\" appears along with more animated fireworks and balloons. This 2011 show lasted 10 minutes and 30 seconds. =Variations= For the 2012 season, Starlight Spectacular begins with the image of a passenger train on the waterfall diving ledge, surrounded by cutout animations of Canadian landmarks while the corresponding provincial flags are displayed on the mountaintop. Attention is brought to a maple leaf which then begins the \\"seasons\\" scene. A roller coaster replaces the star scene, and the dragon emerges from behind the waterfalls instead of a cave, and is not wearing a party hat at the end, where the \\"Happy 30th Birthday\\" is omitted. During the 2013–2015 seasons, the closing shows were called Illuminations of Water. These musical fountain shows featured lighting effects on the upgraded fountains, synchronized to music, with some of the projections from Starlight Spectacular used on Wonder Mountain as a supporting backdrop. Starlight Spectacular returned in 2016, with minor changes to the show to take advantage of the fountain upgrades. During the 2017–2018 seasons, the closing shows were called Northern Reflections, which celebrated the 150th anniversary of Canada. These shows added new scenes and lasers. Starlight Spectacular returned again for the 2019 season. Apparatus =Fountains= The 2013 show was designed in consultation with Crystal Fountains, which supplied products including a sequencing fountain and a programmable fountain effect which can move in different directions. For the 2019 season, the Royal Fountain underwent a mechanical reconstruction of the pumps and control infrastructure. This included removing the Hydra constants and upgrading to a modern variable frequency drive (VFD) to precisely control the water jets and create new effects. Most of the fountain lighting effects are produced by 15 Chauvet Legend fixtures installed around the International Street area, and 500 LED lights submerged in the Royal Fountain. Each of the Royal Fountain's 400 water jets has two to three lighting elements. Additionally, two KVANT Spectrum 20 lasers are installed above ground level. The unique control system is patented by the Canada's Wonderland Company, and programmed using a Grand MA 1 lighting desk. =Projectors= The four projectors that are used during the Starlight Spectacular show. The Starlight Spectacular show uses four Christe Roadster S+20K 3-chip Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors located just in front of the bridge that crosses the fountain pool. =Sound systems= Audio units placed along International Street provide sound comparable to a concert audio system, designed to maximize audio levels within the area. As of 2019, the International Street sound system consists of 16 QSC AD-S82H units on the top of each building along the street. This was an upgrade from the 1997 sound system of 10 EV X array audio stacks with sub-woofers. The 1997 sound system had been installed for the pyrotechnic show \\"The Erruption\\" (1998–2001). When this show was closed (due to the cost of liquid propane for flame effects), the sound system was mainly used for diving shows and special events, in addition to the background park music. Sound for the 2011–2013 seasons was designed by Tantrum and featured original music from Apollo Studios in Montreal. PM Audio provided sound design from the 2013 season. Audio was designed internally from 2014.

A Dictionary of British Place Names concurs, saying that 'gote' is from the Middle English, and that 'Tyddegote' was referenced in 1316. 'Tid', or 'tite', listed in the Domesday Book, is possibly from the Old English 'titt' (teat), referring to a small hill, likely a saltern or salthill.Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.471.

Kelly's Directory in 1855 listed professions and occupations which included a merchant, a postmaster who was also a farmer, a grazier, a gardener & seedsman, a shoemaker, two shopkeepers, and the licensed victualler of the White Lion public house.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire 1855, p.240 By 1872 White's Directory recorded that, in 1858, £200 was borrowed from an 1806 bequest of St Mary's rector, which had doubled by 1854, to purchase a mission house and school at Tydd Gote. In the village was a Primitive Methodist chapel, with adjoining school building, built in 1869 that was attended by 30 children. The Free Methodists had a chapel in the Cambridgeshire part of the village. The Tydd St Mary's parish post office was in Tydd St Gote. Professions and occupations included a schoolmistress, a station master, a merchant living at Roman Villa, a shopkeeper, two bakers, a grocer & draper, a further grocer & draper who was also a chemist, a gardener, a beerhouse owner, and the licensed victuallers of the White Lion and Gote Inn public houses.White, William (1872), Whites Directory of Lincolnshire, pp.783,784 The former Gote Inn at the south of the village By the middle of the following decade a merchant was also listed as a farmer, joined by a further farmer. The station master still lived in the village. There was a coal dealer, a market gardener, and just one baker, but two shopkeepers. A beer retailer was present as were the victuallers of the White Lion and Gote Inn.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p.692 In 1933 there included a physician & surgeon, a grocer who also held the post office, a limited company of fruit growers, two cycle agents working together for Riddington & Steel, a motor engineer, a smallholder, and a farmer, two shopkeepers, a baker, a pork butcher, a grocer, and a blacksmith, a beer retailer, and still the victuallers of the White Lion and Gote Inn public houses.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire 1933, p.586 Greyfriars, between West Road and Hannath Road, dates to the early 17th century.

Retrieved 15 January 2019 In 2000, an archaeological and historical appraisal was carried out for the South Holland District Council to inform a management policy for the Tydd Gote Conservation Area. A site visit recorded the red brick Primitive Methodist chapel, dated to 1903, with the attached former British School, at the northern corner of the east side of Main Road and Station Road. On the opposite side of the Station Road, and fronting Main Road, is the 19th-century Oldfield cottage, rendered and painted white. Opposite, at the west of Main Road, are earthwork remains of Roman Bank, which runs north towards the village of Tydd St Mary. Under Main Road is the Oldfield Cut (drain), the road at this point being a bridge over with a concrete parapet which has attached a plaque with the inscription: 'Tydd Gote Bridge rebuilt by the Holland County Council 1935. Wm A Rogerson MIM & CE County Surveyor'. On Station Road are 19th- and 20th-century red brick houses, and at its south side, running off, are two lines of industrial buildings, one of which has a datestone inscribed: 'Tydd Institute 1914'. Also on Station Road are \\"two pairs of brick semi- detached houses labelled 'Herbert Cottages 1912' and 'Thelma Cottages 1912'\\". A further row of 19th-century houses include the former New Inn, and one with an early to mid-20th-century shop sign reading: 'J.M Shephard, Baker, Corn, Flour and Offal Dealer'. At the junction of Main Street and the north of West Street is a Dutch gable frontage of a building made asymmetrical through earlier alteration. At the other corner is a brick built former shop dating to the 19th century, with its door in a rounded corner. In 2014, Fenland District Council adopted a Local Plan for Tydd Gote, which laid out planning proposals and development strategy for the Cambridgeshire part, which it describes as containing a stable population of 80, as having \\"no mains drainage and no surface water system\\", and as abutting the \\"Tydd Gote [South Holland] Conservation Area\\", therefore requiring sensitivity to the character of the rest of the village. There would be a restriction on building, other than as infill.\\"Tydd Gote\\", District Wide Local Plan, Fenland District Council.

He was also lord of Sermoneta, Bassiano, Marino and also Senator of Rome from 1384. Biography He was born at Fondi, the son of Nicola I Caetani, lord of Sermoneta and Bassiano, and Giacoma Orsini, the daughter of Rinaldo and Giacomo Orsini of Marino. Around 1348, at Nicola's death, he inherited the county of Fondi, which was confirmed him by queen Joanna I of Naples in 1352. He thenceforth started to expand his lands in the northern Kingdom of Naples and southern Papal States (what is now southern Lazio). In 1356, he submitted Anagni and Sezze. His power was also based on familiar ties, both with other members of his family and their feudataries, and with powerful figures such as Francesco Del Balzo Orsini, whose sister he had married. A sister of Onorato married to Stefanello Colonna. In 1367, Pope Urban V excommunicated Caetani, who was besieging Ferentino and was forced to retreat by a papal army. He later reconciled with the papacy and was named rector of Campagna e Marittima. He was among the noblemen who accompanied the return of Pope Gregory XI to Rome in 1377. The Pope, after his stay there was stopped due to a revolt, took refuge at Caetani's court in Anagni. However, the new Pope, Urban VI, deprived him of Campagna and Marittima in 1378: in exchange, Caetani housed at Fondi the cardinals who elected a rival Pope, Clement VII, who established his residence there. On 22 November 1378, Clement restored him as rector of Campagna and Marittima, and also granted him the fiefs of Sermoneta and Bassiano. In the winter of 1379, Caetani took part in the military operations of Clement's followers to capture Rome; despite their defeat, Clement awarded him 2,000 florins for his help and, after the move of his court to Avignon, used Caetani's lands near Fondi as their logistic base in Italy. This period was Caetani's apex: he defeated his rivals at Ninfa, built a fortress at Castellonorato (in the modern comune of Formia, 1380), reclaimed several areas of southern Lazio and distributed lands to his peasants. His power, however, started to decay after Charles of Durazzo's invasion of southern Italy in 1381. Charles, after capturing Naples, executed Baldassarre of Brunswick, Caetani's brother-in-law and his main link with the Neapolitan court, and hired Onorato's brother Giacomo to conquer Fondi. Velletri expelled his Breton mercenaries and also Anagni revolted against him. Caetani however was able to resist, and was one of the supporters of Louis I of Anjou in his attempt to capture the Kingdom of Naples. During the war between the former's successor, Louis II of Anjou and Ladislaus of Durazzo, Caetani did not change sides, and remained an ally of Clement VII and his Avignonese successor, Benedict XIII. This led pope Boniface IX to excommunicate him again (3 May 1399), and a crusade was launched against Fondi. King Ladislaus attacked his lands from the south while papal troops came from the north. After losing Anagni, Sezze and Cisterna, he tried a desperate assault to Rome (15 January 1400), but was defeated at Porta del Popolo. Onorato Caetani decided to submit to Boniface IX, but died soon afterwards of apoplexy.

As of August 2011, the MetaArchive preservation network is composed of 24 secure servers (referred to as “caches”) in four countries with a collective capacity of over 300TB. Forty-eight institutions are actively preserving their digital collections in the network. The MetaArchive Cooperative preserves a wide variety of data types and many genres of content, including electronic theses and dissertations, digital newspapers, archival content such as photograph collections and A/V materials, business/e-records, and datasets. The network is “dark,” meaning access is limited to the content owner/contributor. It is also format-agnostic, meaning that each content contributor may determine what formats it wishes to preserve. History MetaArchive was founded in 2004, when six southeastern University libraries (Auburn University, Florida State University, Emory University, the Georgia Tech Library, University of Louisville, and Virginia Tech) came together to collaboratively explore creating a digital preservation solution that they could own and manage for themselves. With backing from the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP), they used the LOCKSS software to build one of the world’s first operational digital preservation networks. In 2006, these six institutions created an organizational model to enable the project to transition into a sustainable program hosted not by any single member institution, but rather by the Educopia Institute, a 501(c)3 organization that was launched for this purpose. In 2007, the MetaArchive Cooperative began expanding with the addition of new members. How it works MetaArchive enables memory institutions (libraries, archives, museums, historical societies, etc.) to embed both the technical infrastructure and the knowledge that they need to preserve their digital content within their own institutions. Each member institution hosts a server, or “cache”, within the network. All of these caches are united into a closed network using the LOCKSS software. Content is prepared by members as “submission information packages” (SIPs), (see OAIS for more information) and each of these SIPs is replicated seven times and ingested and preserved as AIPs (“archival information packages”) in seven geographically separate caches by member institutions. The network regularly compares these seven AIPs to ensure that nothing about them degrades or changes. If the network detects a change in an AIP, the cache containing the damaged copy re-ingests the source SIP if it is still available; if the source SIP is unavailable, it ingests a copy of the AIP from another cache. Services MetaArchive’s services include data preparation, replication, geographical distribution, bit integrity checking, versioning, security, restricted viewing, and content restoration. When needed, the MetaArchive Cooperative will also perform format migrations for member content (to date, this service has not been required by the Cooperative’s membership). The Cooperative’s ingest procedure is compatible with any repository/content management system, including DSpace, CONTENTdm, ETDdb, and other systems. Membership Levels The Cooperative has three membership levels: * Sustaining Members form the leadership of the Cooperative via their participation as Steering Committee members. * Preservation Members engage in ongoing preservation activities. * Collaborative Members are groups of institutions that run shared, centralized repositories and preserve this shared content in the MetaArchive preservation network. All members run a 16TB server and pay $1/GB/year for their preserved collections. The organizational model created and practiced by the MetaArchive Cooperative has served as a model for myriad other digital preservation groups, including the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA).

Karen Price OBE is the chief executive officer. The not-for- profit organisation works to co-operatively address technology-related skills issues through evidence-based advice, services and programmes. It is led by its constituency, to operate in the interests of employers by ensuring that the UK is equipped to compete in the worldwide digital economy. e-skills UK aims to address the current and future needs of the Business and Information Technology sector in the UK, including skills shortages and gender inequality in the UK IT industry. The group publishes the e-skills Bulletin, and the Regional Gap-UK report on skills gaps. The Technology Insights report details which skills are most needed. The group has also developed sets of qualifications for IT workers. The group devised the e-skills passport and IT User Qualification (ITQ) qualifications, as its National Occupational Standards. History e-skills UK existed in name before 2003 as one of the National Training Organisations (NTO). Their website was launched in 2000. The National Training Organisations became the Sector Skills Councils (SSC) in April 2003. SSCs were started by the Sector Skills Development Agency, under the leadership of chief executive being Christopher Duff. The numbers of the organisations reduced to 23, and funding was increased. e-skills UK was one of the first Councils to be formed. e-skills UK was initially given a five-year licence to be the SSC for the IT and Telecoms industry, under the leadership of Karen Price. In March 2005 e-skills UK was one of four SSCs to publish their first Sector Skills Agreement, outlining what they hoped to realistically achieve; the other councils to publish agreements at that time were the Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies (SEMTA), Skillset and ConstructionSkills. Computer Clubs for Girls, or CC4G, began in South East England in 2002, designed to educate girls about the potential of technology. The pilot scheme started in 280 schools, with £2.8 million funding by SEEDA, and run by Melody Hermon. Computer Clubs for Girls was launched nationwide on 14 June 2005 for girls aged 10–14 at 3,600 schools, and cost £8.5 million. By 2006, around 1,000 schools had registered and 58,000 girls were in the scheme. In the 2006 Birthday Honours Karen Price, chief executive officer of e-skills UK, received an Order of the British Empire (OBE). In 2009, e-skills UK was rated 'outstanding' in the process to re-license Sector Skills Councils. In August 2009, e-skills UK developed a £5.6 million scheme with the Open University called Vital, to train school teachers on technology in a form of continuing professional development (CPD). Vital was launched at the annual BETT trade show. In February 2010 e-skills UK, Google and BT Group formed the Getting British Business Online project (GBBO). In the same year, the group reported that the UK IT industry was around 8% of the UK economy, and covered 5.7% of the working population (IT and telecoms). 860,000 persons worked in the IT industry, plus another approximately 680,000 in IT-related positions.

This construction was at about the same time his uncle Sir Maurice Denys (d. 1563) was rebuilding nearby Siston Court. The house was built on a natural promontory, probably originally selected for its defensible position, converted into an artificial plateau.

The general assemblies of the Transylvanian noblemen and the joint assemblies of the representatives of the \\"Three Nations of Transylvania\\"the noblemen, Székelys and Saxonsgave rise to its development. After the disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in 1541, delegates from the counties of the eastern and northeastern territories of Hungary proper (or Partium) also attained the Transylvanian Diet, transforming it into a legal successor of the medieval Diets of Hungary. The diet sessions at Vásárhely (now Târgu Mureş) (20 January 1542) and at Torda (now Turda) (2 March 1542) laid the basis for the political and administrative organization of Transylvania. The diet decided on juridical, military and economic matters. It ceased to exist following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.  The Composition of the Parliament  The Unio Trium Nationum (Latin for \\"Union of the Three Nations\\") was a pact of mutual aid codified in 1438 by three Estates of Transylvania: the (largely Hungarian) nobility, the Saxon (German) patrician class, and the free military Székelys. László Fosztó: Ritual Revitalisation After Socialism: Community, Personhood, and Conversion among Roma in a Transylvanian Village, Halle-Wittenberg, 2007 The union was directed against the whole of the peasantry, regardless of ethnicity, in response to the Transylvanian peasant revolt. In this typical feudal estate parliament, the peasants (whether Hungarian, Saxon, Székely or Romanian in origin) were not represented, and they did not benefit from its acts, as the commoners were not considered to be members of these feudal \\"nations\\".  Background  Transylvania (\\"Land beyond the Forests\\") was a borderland in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. The development of royal administration is documented from the second half of the 11th century. The royal castle at Torda (now Turda in Romania) was first mentioned in 1075, the fortress at Küküllő (now Cetatea de Baltă in Romania) in 1177. Most royal castles developed into the seats of counties, which were important administrative units, each named for its center. A high-ranking royal official, the voivode was the superior of the ispáns (or heads) of the Transylvanian countiesDoboka, Fehér, Hunyad, Kolozs, Kraszna, Küküllő and Torda. from the late 12th century. Administrative units in Transylvania in the Middle Ages A separate royal official, the Count of the Székelys, lead the Hungarian-speaking Székelys from the 1220s. The Székelys had moved from other regions of the kingdom to Transylvania and formed a community of free warriors. Their administrative units were known as \\"seats\\" from the 14th century. The seatsUdvarhelyszék, Csíkszék, Sepsiszék, Orbaiszék, Kézdiszék, Marosszék and Aranyosszék. were headed by elected officials. The Székelys initially held their lands in common. However, disparity between wealthy and poor Székelys grew, enforcing royal legislation to acknowledge the existence of Székely groups of diverse status in 1473. Thereafter, only the wealthiest Székelys fought in the royal army on horse; those who could only fight as foot-soldiers started to lose their political rights. The ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons settled in the southern and north-eastern regions in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1224, Andrew II of Hungary granted privileges to the Saxons who inhabited southern Transylvania, putting them under the authority of a royal official, the Count of Hermannstadt, and authorizing them to freely elect their local leaders. After a Saxon rebellion, Charles I of Hungary abolished the office of the Count of Hermannstadt and appointed royal judges to head the Saxon districts in 1324. However, the wealth of the Saxon merchants, who controlled the trade routes towards Wallachia and Moldavia, enabled them to gradually achieve the restoration of their autonomy. In 1486, Matthias Corvinus united the Saxon communities under the leadership of the elected mayor of Hermannstadt, who was thereafter known as the Count of the Saxons. The Gesta Hungaroruma book of debated reliabilitystated that Vlachs (or Romanians) had already been present in Transylvania in the late 9th century. The earliest contemporaneous records evidence that Romanian communities existed in southern Transylvania in the first decade of the 13th century. In contrast with the Roman Catholic Hungarians, Székelys and Saxons, the Romanians adhered to the Orthodox Church. Their administrative units were known as lands or districts. The Romanian districts were initially located in royal estates, but most of them were given away to noblemen or prelates by the end of the Middle Ages, or the local chiefs (or knezes) achieved the acknowledgement of their ownership from the kings.  Development  = General assemblies = Royal seal of Andrew III of Hungary who held the first general assembly for the Transylvanian noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians in early 1291 General assemblies of the noblemen from one or more counties developed into important forums of the administration of justice in the entire Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century. Noblemen formed the highest level of the society in the Transylvanian counties. The wealthiest nobles owned dozens of villages, but most noble families had only one or two villages, or only a part of a village. They had specific privileges, such as tax exemption (from 1324), and the right to administer justice in their estates (from 1342). Székely chiefs could only seize private landed property in the counties, outside Székely Land. The wealthiest Saxons also attempted to acquire landed property in the counties, outside the jurisdiction of the Saxon communities. Being obliged to render services (primarily of military nature) for the lands that they possessed, the Romanian leaders' position was similar to the status of the \\"nobles of the Church\\" and other groups of conditional nobles. Consequently, they were not regarded real nobles, but the monarch could award them with nobility. The ennobled Romanians adopted their Hungarian peers' way of life, but dozens of Romanian noble families remained Orthodox for centuries. In comparison with Hungary proper, the autonomy of the Transylvanian counties was limited, because the voivodes restricted the development of their self-governing bodies. The general assemblies of the Transylvanian counties disappeared in the middle of the 14th century. Instead, the voivodes or their deputies held general assemblies for all noblemen from all the counties of the province. The first recorded general meeting of the \\"nobles of the realm of Transylvania\\" was held in Keresztes at Torda (now Cristiş in Romania) on 8 June 1288. The assembly authorized the vice-voivode, Ladislaus Borsa, to assist the representative of Peter Monoszló, Bishop of Transylvania, in taking possession of three villages of a noble family to secure the payment of a fine. The administration of justice remained the principal task of such meetings, but the noblemen who attended the assemblies also regularly discussed other subjects, including the collection of the tithe or custom duties. Initially, all noblemen were entitled to be present, but from the 15th century, the counties sent delegates to the assemblies. The general assembly of the Székelys could be convoked by the Count of the Székelys, or by the captain of Udvarhelyszék. The internal issues of the Saxons communities were initially regulated by the assemblies of the Saxon seats and districts. From 1486, the Count of the Saxons presided over the annual general assemblies of the entire community, which consisted of the highest-ranking officials of the seats and districts and elected delegates. The monarchs or on their behalf the voivodes could also convoke the representatives of all privileged groups of Transylvania to meet at a joint assembly. Andrew III of Hungary was the first king to hold such an assembly for the representatives of the Transylvanian noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians in early 1291. According to Andrew's charter mentioning the meeting, the king ordered the return of two domains to Ugrin Csák after those who attended the general assembly testified that he had been their lawful owner. = Union of the Three Nations = Transylvania was regularly raided by Ottoman armies from the 1420s, forcing the monarchs and the local authorities to strengthen the defense of the province. At the initiative of Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, the general assembly of the Transylvanian noblemen ordered in 1419 that one third of the noblemen and one tenth of the peasants were to take up arms in case of an Ottoman invasion against the Székely and Saxon territories. New taxes were introduced and the old taxes were increased to cover the costs of defense, which outraged the peasantry. After George Lépes, Bishop of Transylvania, demanded the payment of the tithe that he had failed to collect in the previous years, thousands of Hungarian and Romanian commoners and lesser noblemen took up arms against him in early 1437. They routed the army of the voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, in July. Without seeking royal authorization, the vice-voivode convoked the noblemen and the leaders of the Székelys and Saxons to hold a joint assembly at Kápolna (now Căpâlna in Romania). At the meeting, the representatives of the noblemen, Székelys and Saxons concluded a \\"brotherly union\\" on 16 September, pledging to provide assistance to each other against their internal and external enemies. The agreement of the three privileged groups gave rise to the idea of the \\"Union of the Three Nations of Transylvania\\", which replaced the previous concept about the three Transylvanian regions (that is, the counties, and the Székely and Saxon seats). The noblemen (including the Székely, Saxon, Romanian nobles who held landed property in the counties) made up the Hungarian nation, but the Hungarian peasants were excluded from this group. The Székelys formed a separate nation, although they spoke Hungarian. The Saxons who lived in the privileged districts were the members of the Saxon nation, but the Saxon population of the counties was not included. The \\"brotherly union\\" was first confirmed on 2 February 1438, after the fall of the peasant revolt. The representatives of the Three Nations again confirmed their alliance in 1459, expanding it against all who threatened their liberties. The regular meetings of the delegates of the Three Nations developed into \\"Transylvania's foremost representative\\" assemblies, providing basis for the Transylvanian Diet. The legislative function of the assemblies strengthened in the second half of the 15th century. In 1463, the representatives of the \\"Three Nations\\" ordered that the poorest noblemen and the Hungarian peasants should stay behind to defend the province although King Matthias Corvinus had ordered a general mobilisation against the Ottomans. In 1494, the general assembly forbade the collection of the extraordinary tax that Vladislaus II of Hungary had introduced, forcing the monarch to personally come to Transylvania and preside over the next general assembly. The role of the separate general assemblies of the Székelys also strengthened. A general assembly which was held without the consent of the Count of the Székelys in 1505 established a supreme court for Székely Land. = Disintegration of Hungary = George Martinuzzi: he held the first joint assembly of the representatives of the Three Nations of Transylvania and the counties of the Partium Transylvania was mentioned as a regnum (or realm) in royal charters already in the second half of the 13th century. When writing of the regnum Transylvanum, the royal charters initially referred to the Transylvanian noblemen who formed a closed community \\"bound together by certain reciprocal rights and duties\\". The Székely and Saxon communities were included in the concept only after the confirmation of the Union of the Three Nations in 1459. The Tripartitumthe compendium of the customary law of Hungary, completed in 1514explicitly acknowledged that Transylvania was a separate realm, with her own peculiar customs, but it also emphasized that Transylvania was an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The laws of the Kingdom of Hungary were to be applied in Transylvania and the decisions of the royal courts of justice were also to be obeyed in the province. The Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Mohács on 29 August 1529. Louis II of Hungary died and two candidates laid claim to the vacant throne. The majority of the noblemen elected the voivode of Transylvania, John Zápolya, king, but the wealthiest magnates offered the throne to Louis II's brother-in-law, Ferdinand of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria. During the ensuing civil war, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary was actually divided into two parts, with John Zápolya controlling the eastern regions, including Transylvania. Taking advantage of the turmoil which followed Zápolya's death in 1540, Suleiman conquered the central regions of the kingdom in late summer 1541. However, he allowed Zápolya's widow, Isabella Jagiellon, to continue to rule the lands to the east of the Tisza on behalf of her infant son, John Sigismund Zápolya, who had already been elected king at the initiative of his father's staunch supporter, George Martinuzzi. Martinuzzi held an assembly for the representatives of the privileged groups of John Sigismund's realm in Debrecen on 18 October 1541. This was the first Diet where both the Three Nations of Transylvania and the counties of Partium (the region between the Tisza and Transylvania) were represented. The delegates swore fealty to the Zápolyas and acknowledged the sultan's suzerainty. The following similar Diet was held only in 1544, but thereafter the delegates from the Partium were always invited to attend the Diet. Consequently, the Diet of John Sigismund's realm became a legal successor of the medieval Diet of Hungary. Laws could only be enacted and taxes could only be collected with the consent of the Diet, but most Diets were dominated by the monarch's partisans, which secured the imposition of royal will.  Age of elected princes  = History = John Sigismund only renounced the title of king of Hungary in the Treaty of Speyer in 1570. Thereafter he was styled prince of Transylvania, but his successors' right to use the new title was acknowledged by the Habsburg rulers of Royal Hungary only in 1595, during the reign of Sigismund Báthory. In that year, Báthory joined the anti-Ottoman Holy League of Pope Clement VIII. = The Diets =  Composition  The Diet was unicameral, with both appointed and elected members. Most Diets were attended by 130-150 persons. The noblemen (the \\"Hungarian nation\\") dominated the Diets, but the Székelys' military power and the Saxons' wealth secured the effective protection of their interests. The majority of the members of the Diets adhered to the Reformed Church in the 17th century. The Saxons represented the Evangelical Church, but the Catholic and Unitarian denominations were in practice reduced to background. Royal counselors, judges of the royal court of justice and other high-ranking royal officials were ex officio members of the Diet. Available data show that the bishops of the Reformed and Evangelical Churches also had seats at the Diets, according to historian Zsolt Trócsányi. The bishops of the Orthodox Romanians were certainly notified when the Diet was announced, but their regular presence is not documented. The presence of Catholic prelates is uncertain. János Bethlen recorded that the vicar of the Catholic Diocese of Transylvania was deliberately ignored in 1666, because the Catholic priests had denied to pay taxes. The princes were entitled to invite individuals to attend the Diet. The number of these \\"regalists\\" was not regulated, but more than twenty noblemen received a personal invitation from the monarch before each Diet. The number of regalists increased: more than 80 noblemen were personally invited to the Diet in 1686. Most regalists were members of the wealthiest noble families. Székely leaders were also personally invited, although the Székely community opposed this practice. According to János Bethlen's notes, the widows of former regalists were customarily also requested to send representatives to the Diets. The counties, Saxon and Székely seats and about twenty towns had the right to send delegates to the Diets. The number of delegates depended of the importance of the issues to be discussed. According to a decree of the Diet which assembled in April 1571, each county and Székely seat had to send ten representatives to the following Diet where the successor of John Sigismund was to be elected. However, this was an extremely high number; sporadic data show that each autonomous community dispatched two to eight delegates to most Diets. The speaker of the Diet (or praeses) held the third most important office in the principality. The speakers and their deputies were almost always appointed by the monarchs. Gábor Haller was the only speaker who was elected by the delegates in the Diets of 1660 and 1661. In most documented cases, the heads of the royal court of justice presided over the Diets. Most speakers were also royal counselors and heads of a county or a Székely seat.  Convocation  The monarchs had the right to summon the Diets. If the prince was absent and during interregnums, the prince's representative (the voivode or governor) convened the assembly. The Diet could also pass a decree ordering the summon of the following Diet, but this happened only exceptionally. The prince or his deputy convened the Diet in a letter, which was in most cases also signed by the chancellor. The letter was posted 2–4 weeks before the opening of the Diet. The appearance at the Diet was obligatory: those who failed were fined 100-200 florins. More than 320 Diets were held from 1571 to 1690, but their annual number fluctuated from year to year. The delegates assembled more frequently during the periods of turmoil. For instance, the Diet was convoked more than fifty times between 1594 and 1606, and more than fifty-five times between 1657 and 1667. According to customary law, the princes were required to hold two Diets in each year. The first Diet of the year was convoked around Saint George's Day (24 April). The second or \\"short Diet\\" was customarily held around the feast of Saint Michael (29 September), but Gabriel Bethlen persuaded the Estates to cancel it in 1622. Most Diets assembled in Gyulafehérvár, especially in the 1590s and between 1613 and 1658. Although the town had customarily been the Transylvanian rulers' seat, the delegates preferred Torda, Kolozsvár and Nagyenyed (now Cluj-Napoca and Aiud in Romania), which were located in the central region of the principality. Frequent invasions forced Michael I Apafi to convoke the Diets to the fortresses of Fogaras and Radnót (now Făgăraș and Iernut in Romania) in the late 1680s. The delegates received detailed instructions at their appointment. Most instructions concerned local issues (such as trade privileges and conflicts between burghers and noblemen), enabling the delegates to freely discuss general topics. However, they could occasionally refer to the lack of instructions if they did not want to discuss certain subjects. For instance, when Michael I Apafi tried to persuade the Diet to pass decrees concerning issues which had not been mentioned in his letter of invitation, the delegates resisted, saying that their instructions did not cover these topics.  Procedure  If the Diet was held in a town other than the prince's seat, the prince came to the town days before the opening of the Diet. The delegates of each Nation or denomination could hold separate meetings before the opening to draft their own proposals on specific issues relating to their community. On the first day of the Diet, the delegates attended a morning worship in a church which was in most cases also the venue of the sessions of the Diets. The sessions could also be held in military camps, or even in a barn in case of emergency. After the morning worship, the delegates sent envoys to the monarch to inform him that they had assembled for the Diet. The princes rarely attended the sessions, but they were represented either by their appointed heirs or lieutenants. The speaker of the Diet made sure that all who had been invited were present. For this purposes, two delegates were required to read out the names of all delegates at the opening of the Diet. The speaker was also responsible for keeping order during the debates. The sessions of the Diets were public, but the Diet could decide to hold a close meeting. In most documented cases, the \\"propositions\\" of the monarch about the topics to be discussed were read out soon after the opening of the Diet. Next, the delegates compiled a memorandum to air the grievances of each Nation,The Nations could, for instance, make complaints about arbitrary actions of the monarchs or their officials. For example, after Gabriel Báthory who had occupied Hermannstadt was murdered, the Saxons demanded the restoration of the town to their community from the new prince, Gabriel Bethlen, in October 1613. The Nations could also demand tax relief or similar concessions. For example, the Székelys requested the prince to exempt them from public labor in spring 1628. (Péter (1994), pp. 313, 316; Trócsányi (1976), pp. 83–87, 90) asking the prince to remedy their problems. The prince was required to respond each point of the memorandum. If the monarch's answer did not satisfy the delegates, the prince and the Diet started to exchange letters about the debated issues. The correspondence lasted until they reached a consensus, or the Diet acknowledged that the prince was unwilling to accept their proposal. The delegates started to discuss the royal propositions only after the debate about their memorandum was finished. Hungarian was the language of the discussions. Each delegate could take the floor, but they were required to stay concise. After closing the debate, the speaker summarized its main points and ordered the delegates to take their votes on the issue under discussion. The decisions passed at the Diets were sanctioned by the monarch. The execution of the laws was also a royal prerogative.  Functions  The princes were elected at the Diets, according to the fundamental laws of the principality. The negotiations preceding a prince's election enabled the Three Nations to secure the issue of a specific charter in which the future monarch pledged to respect their liberties. However, few monarchs were actually freely elected. For instance, Gabriel Báthory seized the throne with the support of the irregular Hajdú troops in 1608; the delegates elected Gabriel Bethlen \\"freely in their fear\\" of Ottoman intervention in 1613, according to the contemporaneous Ferenc Nagy Szabó's sarcastic remark. The Diets performed legislative, administrative and judicial functions. The Diet could authorize the monarch or the royal council to perform its functions. For instance, Christopher Báthory was authorized to take actions against radical Protestants in 1578. Almost 5,000 decrees were passed in the 16th and 17th centuries. Their analysis evidence that the monarchs dominated the political life of the principality. The delegates almost always accepted the royal propositions concerning taxation and made only one attempt to regulate the spending of tax revenues in 1593. They also regularly authorized the monarch to mobilize the general levy. They enacted the state monopolies without significant resistance, although, during the reign of George I Rákóczi, only after lengthy negotiations with the prince. On the other hand, the Diets passed hundreds of decrees about issues of local interest, including the regulation of the quest for runaway serfs or of the boundaries of noble estates. The Diets also functioned as a high court of justice, especially in politically motivated cases. Gabriel Bethlen was found guilty of high treason at the Diet in November 1612, but this decision was cancelled at the first Diet of his rule in October 1613. The Diet sentenced Kata Iffjú, the widow of János Imreffy (who had been Gabriel Báthory's chancellor) to death for incest, fornication and witchcraft during the reign of Báthory's successor, Gabriel Bethlen in early 1614. The legal cases were heard at specific judicial sessions. The Diets sometimes entered into direct correspondence with foreign powers, but the letters evidence that the support of the monarchs' specific diplomatic acts was the delegates' principal purpose. Correspondence between the Diet and pretenders or other internal opponents of the monarch is also documented, especially in the second half of the 17th century.

With his team at CNET, he validated it on the RCP experimental network. He then successfully submitted for the X.25 Recommendation of CCITT, the standard of data networks of the 1970s-1980s. He was the first Chief Technical Officer in charge of the French TRANSPAC network whose X.25 service has been operational from 1978 to 2011 . After working one year for Cap Gemini Sogeti, and four years for SESASociété d'Etudes des Systèmes d'Automation (an X.25-switches company in France), in 1985 Rémi Després founded the LAN and Frame-Relay-products enterprise RCERéseaux de Communication d'Entreprises SA (Enterprise-communication- networks company), a company acquired in 1996 by the CS Group. In 1998, he founded a second startup, StreamCore SA, specialised in quality of service management in TCP/IP, the Internet technology. When Streamcore SA was terminated in 2003, its StreamGroomer products were taken over by a new company, Streamcore Systems SA. Since 2003, Rémi Després has been working as an independent researcher and consultant, mainly contributing to IETF to facilitate deployment of IPv6, the protocol that had become necessary to extend the number of customer addresses of the Internet. In particular, he invented and promoted 6rd, a mechanism whereby Free, an Internet Service Provider, deployed IPv6 service several years before similar network operators, and in only five weeks. Another notable contribution concerned 4rd, a technology to maintain a residual IPv4 service across IPv6-only networks. He also proposed a mechanism for Internet Service Providers to assign IPv6 addresses into customer sites that still have IPv4-only residential gateways, with the distinctive feature that IPv6 traffic between devices of a same site remains within this site. In 2011, Rémi Després and Alexandre Cassen received the Itojun Service Award of the Internet Society for their IPv6 work.

Monsters Each of the main five characters are modeled after classic movie monsters.The Monsters That Inspired ‘Monsters vs. Aliens, BROOKS BARNES, March 19, 2009 https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/movies/22sbar.html?_r=0 =Susan Murphy= Susan Murphy, also called \\"Ginormica\\", (voiced by Reese Witherspoon in films, Riki Lindhome in the TV series) is a normal woman who is hit by a radioactive meteorite on her wedding day, causing her to mutate and grow to a height of . In addition to her size, she is amazingly strong and has a resistance to energy attacks. She serves as the film's central character. She appears in the Halloween special Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space. She makes a cameo in a cliffhanger at the beginning of Night of the Living Carrots. She is based on the protagonist from Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. =B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate)= B.O.B.

Despite having consciousness, he literally and figuratively lacks a brain, and is thus the comic relief. His greatest strength lies in his ability to digest any substance. In the video game, B.O.B.'s gameplay does not require his arms, and so he lacks them altogether. It is revealed in \\"Night of the Living Carrots\\" that he had a fear of carrots due to being force-fed carrot puree in his youth and at the end of the short was turned into a giant, zombie carrot.

He behaves as a macho jock most of the time, but is out of shape. He is an expert martial-artist and leads the team in attacks. According to director Conrad Vernon, Link is not based on any classic movie monster, although he does bear a lot of resemblances to the Creature from the Black Lagoon. =Insectosaurus= Insectosaurus (often referred to as \\"Insecto\\") (voiced by Conrad Vernon), a grub that was transformed by nuclear radiation into a monster with the ability to shoot silk out of its nose. She is a giant monster silkworm that cannot speak clearly, and is mesmerized by bright lights (usually used to lead her to other locations); For the longest time Link thought Insectosaurus was a male, after the emergence from the cocoon it was discover she was actually a female.

Created when Link absentmindedly scares a surviving pumpkin that was standing over a carrot patch in the garden of Susan's parents' home, causing a carrot to absorb the same green goo that mutated the pumpkins and turn into a zombie carrot. =Sqweep's Teacher= Sqweep's Teacher is a minor character seen on a few episodes. =Pip= Pip is Sqweep's financial planner working for Epsilon-11 Allowance Management. He is the same species as Sqweep in dark blue. He came to Earth to collect payment after the monsters and Coverton spent a large amount of money from Sqweep's piggy bank account. =Zed-7 Epsilon Attack Plushy Toy= An aggressive plushy that appears in \\"The Toy from Another World\\". =Leprechaun= Leprechaun is a small luck granting indestructible alien known as a Leprechonian that has anger- management issues.

It occurs in the Mississippi River basin and through the Gulf Coast drainages. It is also found in the Clinch River and the Powell River. This species inhabits rocky or sandy pools in flowing waters up to the size of medium rivers with fast currents. It can reach a length of TL though most only reach about . In 2012, studies found five distinct species that were formerly included in E. stigmaeum. In a paper published in the Bulletin of the Alabama Museum of Natural History, Mayden and Layman described five new species, all named after former U S presidents and one vice president, based on their \\"leadership in conservation policies\\": * Etheostoma teddyroosevelt (highland darter) * Etheostoma jimmycarter (bluegrass darter) * Etheostoma clinton (beaded darter) * Etheostoma gore (Cumberland darter) * Etheostoma obama (spangled darter)  Description  Speckled darters, Etheostoma stigmaeum, are a member of the family Percidae. They have a moderately blunt snout, with no premaxillary frenum. They can reach a maximum length of about 56 mm. They have both spines and rays, their lateral line is incomplete, and their gill covers are slightly connected by a membrane across their throat. The midline of their belly does not have enlarged scales. They have a sandy colored dorsal side and a yellow or white ventral side. There are 6 dark brown saddles and large specks on the dorsum, with 7-11 dark brown blotches down their body. Mating males have turquoise colored bands on their sides and in their fins, as opposed to the typical dark blue. Breeding females are much less brightly colored than the males. They develop and extended genital papilla.  Habitat  Speckled darters are freshwater fish. They prefer clear pools of up to 1 m deep, with moderately swift streams. They typically prefer a bottom of sand or sand and gravel.  Reproduction and Life Cycle  Spawning in Missouri begins as early as March and ends as late as May, at temperatures between 14-17 degrees C. The eggs are buried in substrate, where there is a relationship between temperature and incubation period, with higher temperatures lessening the time. Typical incubation period is about 9–10 days at about 17-20 degrees C. Larvae hatch at about 4.2-5.2 mm with a functional jaw and well developed pectoral fins.  Distribution  The speckled darter is found in eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, western Louisiana, Virginia, northwestern Georgia, western Florida, and in the Dulf drainages from the Sabine River to the Pensacola Bay.  Etymology  The scientific name for the speckled darter is Etheostoma stigmaeum. Etheostoma is derived from the , the Greek word for \\"to strain\\", and the Greek word for \\"mouth\\". Stigmaeum is the Greek word for \\"speckled\\". References * Page, L.M. and B.M. Burr, 1991. A field guide to freshwater fishes of North America north of Mexico.

He moved to Minsk in 1950. From 1960 until 1965 he studied at the 'School of Arts nr. 1' in the same city; in 1966 he started a study at the Belarusian State Academy of Arts, which he finished in 1971. His first exhibition was in 1971 at the Exhibition of Young Artists at the Belarusian National Arts Museum. Since 1971, he has held over 35 exhibitions, in Belarus, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany.According to the info sheet provided at Rodin's exhibition Global Warming at Kunsthaus Tacheles He currently lives and works in Berlin, because (as he describes it himself in an interview with website .eu) 'Berlin is a place interested in art.

Bellabelarus.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.  Rodin's work  Alexander Rodin's paintings are quite unexpected for Belarusian art with its ideological taboos and conventional norms. Art critic Larysa Mikhnevich describes him as 'the representative of neo-avart-garde and of the \\"good old\\" painting: anectdotic and figurative'. His works are often large in size (up to over 6 metres in length and 2 metres in height, albeit spread out over several canvases), and represent surreal scenes in Rodin's mental universe. Rodin's paintings can always be interpreted in several ways. Alexander Rodin wurde 1863 in Belarus geboren. Nach seinem Schulabschluss studierte er bis 1871 mit Erfolg an der Kunstakademie in Minsk.

Overview The underlying concept of the Marmalade SDK is write once, run anywhere so that a single codebase can be compiled and executed on all supported platforms rather than needing to be written in different programming languages using a different API for each platform. This is achieved by providing a C/C++ based API which acts as an abstraction layer for the core API of each platform. Depending on the license purchased, Marmalade SDK supports deployment of applications to the following platforms: Android, BlackBerry 10, iOS, LG Smart TV, Tizen, Mac OS X, Windows Desktop, Roku 2, Roku 3, and Windows Phone 8, but not Linux. The main Marmalade SDK consists of two main layers. A low level C API called Marmalade System provides an abstraction layer that allows a programmer access to device functionality such as memory management, file access, timers, networking, input methods (e.g. accelerometer, keyboard, touch screen) and sound and video output. Marmalade SDK is a C++ API that provides higher level functionality mostly focused on support for 2D (e.g. bitmap handling, fonts) and 3D graphics rendering (e.g. 3D mesh rendering, boned animation). It includes an extensible resource management system and HTTP networking. Marmalade SDK supports Objective C. Marmalade SDK allows access to the graphics rendering capabilities of mobile devices either by using the OpenGL ES API directly (both OpenGL ES 1.x and 2.x are supported) or by using the functionality provided by the Marmalade SDK layer. Marmalade SDK provides support for loading and rendering graphics resources such as bitmap images and 3D model data which would need to be implemented by the user if using OpenGL ES directly. Marmalade SDK provides exporter plug-ins for use with Autodesk 3DS Max and Autodesk Maya to allow 3D models and animations to be used in applications. For supporting older devices with no dedicated rendering hardware, a legacy software based rendering option is provided. On 9 October 2015, Marmalade introduced its own 2D and 3D authoring tools. Marmalade Technologies Limited formerly Ideaworks Ltd, the maker of the 2D/3D Marmalade SDK announced in September 2016http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-09-13-marmalade-ceasing-sdk- support-focusing-on-game-making the ceasing of production and support of its Marmalade Game Platform, choosing instead to focus on the output of its own game studio known as Marmalade Game Studio Ltd. The company announced that after the final iteration in March 2017 the licence server will be turned off and support will cease. In January 2017 GMO Cloudhttps://ir.gmocloud.com/english/news/170104_2682.html– based in Japan obtains the exclusive rights to use the Marmalade SDK which supports both native and hybrid browser-based apps, accelerating the development of new features and supporting game and app development.

Commissioned by Sultan Murad III, who ruled the empire from 1574 to 1595, its text was translated from Arabic and all its miniatures were apparently directed by the famous master Nakkaş Osman, who undoubtedly painted the opening series of images related to the signs of the zodiac. Osman, the head of the painters at the seraglio workshop from 1570 onwards, created a style renowned for its lifelike portraits that influenced other artists in Murad's court. Murad III and his times In the latter half of the 16th century, the domains of the Ottoman Empire stretched from Budapest to Baghdad, and Oman and Tunisia to Mecca and Medina, encompassing such great cities as Damascus, Alexandria and Cairo. The Turks also controlled the Silk Route, the Black Sea and the eastern half of the Mediterranean. The sultan governed the empire from Constantinople, where architects, painters, calligraphers, jewellers, ceramists, poets, etc., worked for him. Murad, a grandson of Süleyman the Magnificent, was a learned, sybarite sultan, a foremost patron of the arts and responsible to a considerable degree for the great development of Turkish-Ottoman painting in the 16th and early 17th centuries, deemed to be its most fertile period. His reign was also marked by constant warring with Iran and the Christian states of Europe. Sultan Murad III was completely absorbed by the intense political, cultural and sentimental life of the harem. He had 103 children, only 47 of whom outlived him. He commissioned this treatise about felicity especially for his daughter Fatima. Murad died at Topkapı Palace in Constantinople in 1595.Encyclopædia Britannica, vol.7, edited by Hugh Chisholm (1911). The manuscript Aries (detail from f. 8v) The Book of Felicity describes in detail the characteristic traits of those born under each of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The illustrations accompanying these descriptions include paintings of how human circumstances change according to the conjunction of the stars, several tables of physiognomical matches, several more about the correct interpretation of dreams and an enigmatic divination treatise for predicting one's future. The manuscript is a peerless testimony of the eastern world of that period, a world inhabited by mysterious characters in peculiar poses, exotic, brightly coloured garments, sumptuous palaces and mansions, and mosques. There are also countless exotic animals such as peacocks and sea serpents, and many birds whose stylised manner is clearly influenced by Japanese painting. There is also a chapter about the monsters, demons and beasts that frequent medieval Turkish imagery. In 2007, the Spanish publishing house M. Moleiro Editor released the first and only facsimile edition of the Book of Felicity: a limited edition of 987 copies, with a companion volume of studies by Miguel Ángel de Bunes Ibarra (CSIC), Evrim Türkçelik (CSIC), Günsel Renda (professor of Ottoman art, Koç University) and Stefano Carboni (Metropolitan Museum of Art).

Hadley–Apennine is a region on the near side of Earth's Moon that served as the landing site for the American Apollo 15 mission, the fourth manned landing on the Moon and the first of the \\"J-missions\\", in July 1971. The site is located on the eastern edge of Mare Imbrium on a lava plain known as Palus Putredinis. Hadley–Apennine is bordered by the Montes Apenninus (often referred to as \\"Apennine Front\\"), a mountain range, and Hadley Rille, a meandering channel, on the east and west, respectively. Data obtained from the composition of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% obtained from the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem to vary in their texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia. Geography and geology =Location= Orbital photo of Hadley-Apennine with Apollo 15 traverses labeled Astronaut David Scott lands Apollo 15's Lunar Module Falcon at Hadley, with navigational assistance from James Irwin, on July 30, 1971. Starts at about . The Lunar Module Falcon backdropped by the Swann Range of the Montes Apenninus Hadley–Apennine is located west of the Montes Apenninus and east of Hadley Rille. The Apennine mountains form a escarpment that rises higher above the Hadley plain than the Himalayan front above the plains of India and Nepal. Hadley Rille (also referred to as Rima Hadley) is located to the west of the Apollo 15 landing site and was the subject of substantial investigation during that mission. The feature, named from nearby Mons Hadley, is a channel that was likely formed by volcanic processes earlier in the history of the Moon. =Apollo 15 landing site= The American Apollo 15 mission, the first of the J-series missions that featured both increased scientific capability and the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, landed in an area of the Hadley–Apennine region to the west of the Apennine Front situated between the mountains Mons Hadley and Mons Hadley Delta to the northeast and south, respectively. This landing site was selected with the objectives of exploring the Apennine Front, Hadley Rille, and other geologic features in the area. Apollo 15 was the first mission in which landing sites were not restricted to equatorial areas. The Hadley–Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity. The site had been of interest to mission planners since early in the program. During the early stages of Apollo landing site planning, Apollo 19 (which was originally planned to be the fourth and penultimate J-mission of the initial exploration portion of the Apollo program) was tentatively set to land in the Hadley–Apennine region, albeit at a point south of the eventual Apollo 15 site and west of Hadley Rille—near the Carlos pit at the southwestern terminus of the rille. An area known as the Marius Hills was also considered for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a landing on the edge of Mare Imbrium at the Hadley–Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley–Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would create a more optimal configuration for seismic study. =Apennine Front= The Apennine mountains, which rise to a height of nearly --farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plains--are hypothesized to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta is believed to be an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium. The area of the Apennine mountains between Mons Hadley and Silver Spur (a mountain just southeast of Mons Hadley Delta), although lacking an official designation on maps and other official mission literature, was informally referred to as the \\"Swann Range\\" by Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin, after mission geology team leader Gordon Swann. One of the mountains in the Swann Range was informally referred to by the astronauts as \\"Big Rock Mountain\\", after the Apollo Program Director at the time of the mission, Rocco Petrone. A thick regolith layer on the lower slopes of the mountains and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes are suggested by the relative absence of large boulders on the lower mountain flanks. The majority of the samples collected by the Apollo 15 astronauts from the Apennine Front are, other than KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, included anorthosite, and recrystallized norite and breccia. Unknown before the Apollo 15 mission, there are parallel linear patterns on the faces of the mountains in the area. Although they appeared to be occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A dark band on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew. =Rima Hadley= Hadley Rille, taken by Apollo 15 astronaut James Irwin. Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located west of the Apollo 15 landing site, begins in an area of low domes at an elongated crater, Béla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Béla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally a lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Béla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings. Rima Hadley typically ranges in depth between , but is approximately deep at the Apollo 15 landing site. The feature has a cumulative length of about and an average width of about . The sides of the rille, at the Apollo 15 site, slope downwards at an angle of about 25 degrees. Before samples were returned from the Moon during the Apollo program, several scientists believed that the feature and other similar features were formed by flowing water. This hypothesis has since been changed, however, to attribute the process of the feature's creation to volcanism. Rima Hadley is interpreted as one of the most defined sinuous rilles on the lunar surface. Outcrops of rock were observed by the Apollo 15 crew on both the near and far sides of the rille and were photographed and, in the case of outcrops on the near rim, were sampled. Layering in these outcrops is evident from the photos taken of them by the crew. Some of the strata observed have thicknesses of up to about and appear to vary in albedo (reflectivity) and texture. Large boulders near the bottom of the rille are believed to be blocks that have broken off of the outcrops above. =South Cluster and North Complex= The South Cluster, a crater cluster located to the south of the Apollo 15 site near Mons Hadley Delta, is believed to have formed as a result of a secondary impact, or the impact of ejecta/debris from a larger impact elsewhere on the Moon, probably the crater Autolycus about northwest of the cluster's location. This meant that the Apollo 15 astronauts were able to sample material from other parts of the lunar surface without traversing a great distance. The feature also allowed the astronauts to sample material that was originally located deep within the Moon. The south rim of Dune crater within the cluster was visited by the astronauts. The North Complex is a collection of several landforms, including craters, that were thought to have been formed by volcanic activity. Although the Apollo 15 astronauts were to visit this feature, they were unable to do so due to time constraints and time-consuming issues in obtaining core samples.

He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Portsmouth in 1545. Life Fryer, born at Balsham, Cambridgeshire, was educated at Eton College and went to King's College, Cambridge in 1517. He graduated B.A. in 1521 and M.A. in 1525. On 5 November 1525 he was incorporated at Oxford, being one of three masters of arts who had been preferred to Cardinal College; all Lutherans, they were obliged to leave. He was imprisoned for heresy in the Savoy Hospital. By 1528 he was again a prisoner, this time in the Fleet Prison. On 16 September 1528 he addressed from prison an elegant Latin letter to Cardinal Wolsey. Fryer's scholarship and personal qualities gained him the friendship of many eminent men, especially that of Edward Foxe, then Provost of King's College. By Foxe's assistance he was able to study medicine at the University of Padua, where he took the degree of M.D. in 1535. It is probable that he was incorporated on this degree at Cambridge. In December 1535 he attended Foxe at the Diet of Smalcalde in Saxony. The following year he returned home, and ultimately settled in London, residing in Bishopsgate within the parish of St Martin Outwich. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1536, was censor in 1541, 1553, 1554, 1555, and 1559, elect in 1547, consiliarius in 1548 and 1555 to 1560, and president in 1549 and 1550. On 24 June 1560 Fryer was committed to the Compter; he was liberated on the following day. In 1561 he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, not for Lutheranism but for Catholicism, ‘wherein he was educated’ (cf. Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser. Addenda, 1547–65, p. 510). There in an examination of his servant, Thomas How, organ-maker, taken before Sir William Chester, lord mayor of London, 23 April 1561.

Fryer was liberated from prison in the beginning of August 1563, but died of the plague on 21 October, and was buried at St. Martin Outwich. His nuncupative will is attested by a curate of St Martin's. Family His wife, Ursula, and several of his children also lost their lives by the pestilence. In her will, proved 28 December 1563, Mrs. Fryer, after desiring burial with her husband, names as her children three sons, Thomas, Jarmyn, and Reinolde, and two daughters, Mathe and Lucie.

He is best known for winning a series of important races including four Group One races: the Champion Stakes, the Dubai Sheema Classic, the International Stakes, and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Background Nayef is a large, powerfully built bay horse bred in Kentucky by his owner, Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum. He was sired by Gulch and was the last foal of the notable broodmare Height of Fashion, making him a half-brother to Derby winner Nashwan and multiple Group race winner Unfuwain. He was trained throughout his career by Marcus Tregoning at Kingwood Stables in Lambourn and ridden in seventeen of his nineteen races by Richard Hills. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Unlike most racehorses, Nayef bypassed maiden races, making his debut instead against more experienced colts in the Listed Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes at Newbury. He was nevertheless made 7-4 favourite on the basis of his reputation and won by a neck from Tamburlaine. The form of the race looked particularly strong when the runner- up went on to finish second in the Group One Racing Post Trophy later in the season. Nayef followed up in the Autumn Stakes at Ascot, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and pulling away to win by an \\"impressive\\" six lengths. Once again, the form of the race was boosted by later events, when the third-placed Count Dubois won the Group One Gran Criterium in Milan two weeks later. Nayef's two-year-old career had followed a family pattern: Unfuwain had won the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes in 1987, while Nashwan won the Autumn Stakes a year later. Nayef was made winter favourite for both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby, despite never having contested a Group race. The official handicapper, Matthew Tester, awarded him \\"the highest rating a two-year-old has ever been given without running in Group company\\". One writer, albeit some time after the fact, noted that Nayef had been \\"hyped as the second coming of Pegasus\\". =2001: three-year-old season= Nayef failed to realise his promise in the early part of 2001. He began with an odds-on defeat to Tobougg on soft ground in the Craven Stakes. and in the 2,000 Guineas he appeared to be outpaced after disputing the lead for most of the way and faded to finish eighth behind Golan. A week before the Derby, Marcus Tregoning withdrew Nayef from the race, feeling that he was not mature enough for Epsom and saying that the colt had \\"grown an awful lot and I just feel his strength has gone for the time being\\". On his return to the racecourse, Nayef finished third in the Group Three Gordon Stakes at Goodwood, prompting one columnist to write that \\"if there has been one disappointment this season, it has been Nayef\\". From that point on however, his form improved steadily. He won the Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock by five lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages and then took the Select Stakes \\"easily\\" by six. In September he won his third Group race in a row, \\"ploughing\\" through soft ground at Ascot in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes. Jim McGrath, writing in the Telegraph, said, \\"Nayef has been a revelation in the last few weeks, showing signs that he is starting to mature into the colt many hoped he would be.\\" In October, he was moved up to the highest level to run in the Group One Champion Stakes at Newmarket. Nayef recorded his most important success so far, taking the lead inside the last furlong and beating Tobougg by three quarters of a length in \\"courageous and decisive\\" style. Tregoning said, \\"I always knew we had the item.\\" =2002: four-year-old season= Nayef began 2002 by being taken to the UAE to participate in the Dubai World Cup. He was well supported in the betting, being offered at odds of 11/2, but shortly before the race he was withdrawn by Hamdan Al Maktoum, who preferred to rely on Sakhee. Nayef was re-routed to the longer Dubai Sheema Classic which he won easily by two lengths from a field that included runners from France, Germany, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Japan and the UAE. For the second consecutive year, Nayef took time to produce his best form in Europe. In the Tattersalls Gold Cup on soft ground at the Curragh, he was beaten as odds-on favourite by the Irish filly Rebelline, and at Royal Ascot he finished fourth, seven lengths behind Grandera, in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, Nayef ran his best race since returning from Dubai. He was sent into the lead by Richard Hills in the straight, but despite staying on well under pressure, he was overtaken fifty yards from the finish and beaten a head by Golan. He improved further at York, where he reversed the form with Golan in the International Stakes. The two colts were again closely matched, but this time Nayef prevailed by half a length, prompting his connections to talk of travelling to Chicago for the Breeders' Cup. However, Nayef was unable to compete in any of the major autumn races. Shortly before a scheduled attempt to win a second Champion Stakes, he contracted a respiratory infection which forced him to miss the rest of the season. =2003: five-year-old season= Nayef began his five-year-old career by once again travelling to Dubai as a leading hope for the Dubai World Cup, but this time he was allowed to take part. He started 11/8 favourite but, having his first run for seven months and racing on dirt for the first time, he finished third to Moon Ballad. Nayef returned to England to record his last important victory in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. Taking the lead in the straight, he pulled clear to claim a two and a half length win, beating a field which included Rakti, Falbrav, Grandera, Islington and Moon Ballad. After this win Marcus Tregoning described him as, \\"a super racehorse, everybody's dream of a racehorse\\". Hopes of securing a £1,000,000 \\"Summer Triple Crown\\" bonus ended in his next race when he finished strongly but was unable to overhaul Falbrav in the Eclipse Stakes after Richard Hills had been unable to find space for a clear run in the early part of the straight. Despite this defeat, Nayef was made favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes three weeks later but was unable to produce any serious challenge in finishing seventh to Alamshar. It was the first time that he had finished out of the prize money since his run in the 2,000 Guineas well over two years previously. In his last two starts, Nayef was unable to recapture his form. In the International Stakes, he finished three lengths further behind Falbrav than he had done in the Eclipse and in the Champion Stakes, he faded in the closing stages to finish eighth of the twelve runners behind Rakti. Assessment In the 2000 International Classification, Nayef was rated 119, making him the fourth-highest-rated two-year-old colt in Europe.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc01/EndMaterial.pdf A year later, he was rated 121, making him the sixth-highest-rated three-year-old colt in Europe.http://www.tjcis.com/pdf/icsc02/EndMaterial2002.pdf In 2002, Nayef was rated 125, making him the eighth-highest-rated horse in the Classification.http://www.horse-races.net/library/article-011503.shtml In the 2003 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Nayef was again rated at 125, making him the eleventh best horse in the world.http://www.horseracingintfed.com/resources/Ratings_All_04.pdf Nayef was given a peak Timeform rating of 129.http://www.thoroughbredinternet.com/newsmore.html?Id=1336 Stud career Nayef was retired from racing to stand as a stallion at his owner's Nunnery Stud.

Early life Ki was born the youngest of seven siblings on (Great) Yeonpyeong Island, Gyeonggi Prefecture, Korea. His father hailed from Hwanghae Province in present-day North Korea, which he fled amid the turmoil of the Korean War (1950–53). His father remained on the island working as a county-level functionary until 1964, when he moved with his family to the peninsular mainland, settling in Soha Village, Gyeonggi Prefecture (present-day Soha District, Gwangmyeong City). While growing up in a shanty town west of Incheon in an area known for its communities of displaced refugees and evacuees, Gi attended Siheung Elementary School where he proved a top student, his awards for outstanding performance filling up a ramyeon box.Complete Works of Gi Hyeongdo (Gi Hyeongdo jeonjip) Munhak gwa jiseong sa (Moonji Publishers), Seoul, 1999. Ki's father built the family home and at first made a good living as a farmer. When a promising business deal fell through, however, family fortunes declined and then further worsened with the father's collapse from cerebral palsy in 1969. The family's plot of land had to be sold to pay for the father's medical expenses. Ki's prose poem \\"Genealogy in Jeopardy-1969\\" (위험한 가계 -1969) describes the sombre mood of his home life during this period. His mother was obliged to work outside the home as a market-seller to feed her family, and the children also had to work. Education As a student at Sillim Middle School (1973–76), Ki began writing poetry after one of his sisters was murdered in an act of violence perpetrated by a congregation (church) member. Besides writing, he was active as a baritone in a school choral group called \\"Mokdong\\" and regularly won prizes at school literary composition contests. After graduating from Jungang High School in 1979, Ki entered Yonsei University as a student in Political Law. He joined the campus literary group \\"Yonsei Literature Club\\" (연세문학회) and received commendation from the campus newspaper for a short novel detailing his unhappy family life. He chose Political Diplomacy as his major in 1980. He entered obligatory military service in 1981 and was stationed near Anyang City, where he participated in the local literary circle \\"Suri.\\" The group inspired Ki to further engross himself in writing poetry. After his discharge he continued to read and to write. He rematriculated to Yonsei University in 1983 and in the same year won the campus Yun Dong-ju Prize for his poem \\"Tree-Planting Ceremony\\" (식목제). Fame In 1984, Ki was employed as a reporter at the JoongAng Ilbo, a daily newspaper, while continuing his studies and honing his creative writing skills. He formally debuted in the world of letters by winning the Donga Ilbo New Year's Literary Contest with his celebrated poem \\"Fog\\" (안개), a stinging critique of Korea's industrializing society. He graduated from Yonsei in 1985 and joined the JoongAng Ilbo's prestigious Politics section as a full-time reporter. At this time he began publishing poems marked by powerful individuality and an intensely pessimistic world view combining exquisite sensibility with themes of helplessness, longing, disappointment and anger. The content of Ki's poems often refers to unknown sexual partners or desires which are always referred to in gender neutral terms which can be interpreted as a way to keep from fully disclosing his sexuality.http://koreabridge.net/post/reading-list-gaypoetkorea-interview- gabriel-sylvian-poetry-gi-hyeong-do-kimchi-queen In 1986, he requested to be transferred from the Politics section to the Culture section where he covered cultural events, publications and TV dramas. In the summer of 1988, he traveled alone to London and Paris. He transferred again to the Editing section the same year.

He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he proceeded M.A. in 1660, and was incorporated at Oxford on 14 July 1663. He found himself, however, unable to conform, and was accordingly expelled from Warkworth, Northamptonshire, when acting as curate to Dr. Temple, the incumbent. Shortly afterwards he migrated to the west of England, preaching occasionally at Bath and Bristol. Finally he settled in London as assistant to Timothy Cruso at the English presbyterian meeting-house in Poor Jewry Lane. He continued with Cruso's successor, William Harris, until his death on 21 July 1701, at the age of sixty-four.

He graduated B.A. at Cambridge in 1691, and M.A. in 1704. He had severe hypochondriasis following his too vigorous external treatment of an attack of itch. The hypochondriasis was accompanied by dyspepsia, and he cured himself by exercise on horseback and by emetics. This led him to write a book on the use of exercise in the treatment of disease, called Medicina Gymnastica, or a Treatise concerning the power of Exercise with respect to the Animal Œconomy, and the great necessity of it in the Cure of several Distempers, 1704.

It is a private game reserve located on a central plateau in Namibia, just three hours north of Windhoek. The reserve rests in between the towns of Otjiwarongo, Omaruru and Okahandja. The land on which Erindi was founded, has been reclaimed as part of a massive rehabilitation and conservation venture. The owners, Chris and Gert Joubert, originally bought the 70 719 hectares of land with the intention of going into cattle farming. It was soon realized that farming cattle is an extremely costly practice, and they abandoned the idea in favor of a private game reserve. The aim was to restore endemic species to the area, with the hope that they would once again thrive there. Since 1998, careful management of Erindi Private Game Reserve has ensured the recovery of the ecological balance between vegetation, herbivores, and predators, so that the numbers and diversity of species lead to sustainable land utilization and socio-economic benefits for all in the area. The restoration of the local wildlife to Erindi Private Game Reserve has been particularly commendable. Species that were once persecuted by neighboring farms and villages have a safe haven here; where they are fully protected, rehabilitated, and released back into the wilderness.  Origin of Name  “Erindi” is a word taken from the local Herero language, meaning “place of water”.  History  European traders and missionaries were the first recorded people who travelled through the area of Namibia that now contains Erindi, probably from Walvis Bay northwards in the direction of Ovamboland in the mid-1800s. But evidence shows that other people used to inhabit this land such as the indigenous Herero and San tribes. There are signs of seasonal Herero farmers having moved through the area, as well as significant San rock paintings and engravings on “Big Bushman” Mountain. In 1986, the Joubert brothers bought the land from the Imperial Cold Storage and Supply Company (ICS). They were determined to turn it into a model cattle farm, so they invested money, time and energy into the project. By the early 1990s, the brothers realized that to increase overall profitability of the farm, they would need to gradually start stocking the farm with game. Natural food resources was a major concern, so to avoid competition with the cattle, they introduced plains game. They fenced 3 000 hectares and put 55 giraffe on it in 1992. This was a noticeably successful venture, so more game such as the Blue Wildebeest and African Elephant were brought in from Etosha National Park. The farm was already home to wild animals like the Gemsbok, Kudu, Leopard, Cheetah, Honey-Badger, Baboon and many others. However, to concentrate fully on conservation and turn Erindi into an ecotourism destination, the owners realized that the land would have to be briefly utilized for hunting purposes. A four-year period as a trophy hunting outfitter helped to raise the much-needed funds to continue their conservation dreams. Cattle farming had been completely phased out, and the reserve had been fitted with all the game management requirements. By 2008, Old Traders Lodge was erected and open for visitors. Since then, Camp Elephant was constructed, and several successful conservation programmes run concurrently.  Geology  Erindi Private Game Reserve is situated on a central plateau in the highlands of Namibia. The terrain is a combination of soils eroded from neighboring mountains. In the west of the reserve, the Erongo Mountains have been linked to the Post-Karoo Complex. The main geology of the area is granite, basalt, and volcanic rocks. While to the east, the Omataku Mountains are inselbergs, which rise sporadically throughout the plains. These consist of Etjo sandstone and magmatic rock. This was formed millions of years ago. Erindi Private Game Reserve shows characteristics of both mountain ranges. Two perennial rivers flow through the reserve. In the south, the Slang River flows when there is a heavy rainfall, and just outside the northern boundary, is the Otjimakuru River.  Climate  Namibia has extreme temperatures that fluctuate greatly between day and night. In summer the minimum summer temperature recorded is 17 °C and the maximum 43 °C. In winter temperatures range between 1 °C at night and 28 °C during the day.  Vegetation  Erindi Private Game Reserve has vegetation ranging from savannah plains to thorny bushveld and rocky mountains. It is classified as an arid to semi-arid category. Riverines that flow after heavy rainfall weave in and around the reserve, providing relief to large trees. The plant life is beautiful, and unique species manage to flourish in the harsh conditions. Endemic plants include the Phantom tree; tall succulent Kobas, and numerous Acacia species. There are over 72 tree species, 75 grass species and an unknown number of flower species in Erindi Private Game Reserve. Scientists have recorded as many of the species as possible, but this research is ongoing.  Fauna  The region where Erindi was founded, had many naturally occurring species in fairly large numbers. After cattle farming was phased out, the owners decided to reintroduce more endemic species to the region and give the existing plains game species a chance to thrive. Erindi Private Game Reserve is home to many successful conservation projects. = Carnivores = The large carnivores that can be found in the reserve include the Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatis), Leopard (Panthera pardus), Lion (Panthera leo), Brown Hyena (Hyaena brunnea), Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and African Wild Dog (Lycaon pictus). Medium-sized carnivores include the Serval (Leptilaurus serval) Caracal (Caracal caracal), African Wild Cat (Felis silvestris), Bat-Eared Fox (Otocyon megalotis), Black- Backed Jackal (Canis mesomelis), Cape Fox (Vulpes chama), Ground Pangolin (Manis teminckii), Aardvark (Orycteropus afer), Aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), and Honey-Badger (Mellivora capensis). Small carnivores include the Striped Polecat (Ictonyx striatus), the Small-Spotted Genet (Genetta genetta), Yellow Mongoose (Cynictis penicillata), Kaokoland Slender Mongoose (Galerella flavescens), Banded Mongoose (Mungos mungo), and Meerkat (Suricata suricatta). = Global Leopard Project = In Namibia, leopards are considered ‘problem animals’ since farmers perceive them as a threat to livestock. As a result, these creatures are now considered elusive as they have had to adapt to a hostile environment, in which heavy persecution is rife. Only trained professionals will be successful in locating them. The Global Leopard Project is a registered foundation established in Erindi Private Game Reserve in 2007, with research, communication, and conservation as the core strategy. The data collected from these wild leopards is shared widely to assist in the sustainable use of the species by other researchers, farmers, hunters, and any other interested parties. Guests at Erindi can donate money towards the foundation by participating in the specialized Leopard Project Drive, Leopard Project Presentation and Leopard Project Walk. These funds go directly towards the Global Leopard Project and other conservation projects at Erindi. = Herbivores = The large herbivores on Erindi include the African Elephant, Hippopotamus, Southern Giraffe, and Eland. Medium-sized herbivores include the Hartmann’s Zebra, Plains Zebra, Waterbuck, Springbuck, Common Impala, Greater Kudu, Blesbuck, Black Wildebeest, Blue Wildebeest, Red Hartebeest, and Gemsbok. Small herbivores can be found in a range of territories across Erindi Private Game Reserve. Species like the Common Duiker, Steenbuck, Klipspringer, Damara Dik-Dik, Rock Hyrax and Scrub Hare. = Omnivores = The Common Warthog is the only known omnivore on Erindi. = Birds = Erindi is home to over 300 endemic bird species.  San Rock Art  On Erindi Private Game Reserve, evidence suggests that ancient tribes once inhabited the region, with more than 100 individually engraved animal depictions discovered on Erindi’s one particular rock site. The National Museum’s Rock Art Department of South Africa surveyed the area and confirmed that the rock art on Erindi’s “Big Bushman” Mountain is fine-lined San engravings. The San are hunter-gatherer people, indigenous to southern Africa. They belong to the Khoisan group that speak the “click” languages. Researchers' interpretation of the San people is that their beliefs and rituals are very much a part of their art. Some of the animal engravings include; giraffe, elephant, eland, hyena, ostrich, kudu, reptiles, buffalo and other plains game. According to the National Museum’s Rock Art Department, the rock depictions on Erindi are over 700 years old. San rock paintings are usually found in caves and on large boulders, and in many cases, these caves were used as shelters. San rock engravings are cut onto the rock surface and usually found in rocky outcrops and riverbeds. Today, there are still San families living on the reserve, but since they are a nomadic tribe, they tend to disappear from time to time. To see and learn about San mythology and their art, Erindi offers a Bushman Art Walk, Art Valley Climb, and San Village Trip.

Biography Habershon, born in 1789, came of a Yorkshire family. In 1806 he was articled to the architect William Atkinson, with whom he remained for some years as assistant. He was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy between 1807 and 1827. He designed churches at Belper (1824), Minster, Bishop Ryders (all in Derbyshire), and at Kimberworth, Yorkshire. At Derby he erected the town hall, which later burnt down, the county courts, and the market. Among the many private houses designed by him were Hadsor House, near Droitwich, Worcestershire, for J. Howard Galton (1827). In 1842 he visited Jerusalem on behalf of the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews, following the dismissal of the architect James Wood Johns, whose project to build an Anglican Cathedral in the city had met with obstruction from the Ottoman authorities. Habershon's final designs for the site took the more diplomatically acceptable form of a chapel attached to a consulate. His building, standing on the foundations laid down by Johns, was completed in 1849, and became known as Christ Church, Jerusalem.Johns' plans for the building are described in his Anglican Cathedral Church of Saint James Mount Zion Jerusalem (1844). See On his way home from Jerusalem in 1843, Habershon had an interview with King Frederick William IV of Prussia, who was associated with England in the establishment of the bishopric of Jerusalem, and in the following year the king conferred on him the great gold medal for science and literature, to mark his appreciation of Habershon's work on The Ancient half- timbered Houses of England (1836). Habershon died in London in 1852, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery. Two of his sons, William Gillbee and Edward, were architects.

MORGOIL is headquartered in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. In 2008 100% of Morgan's shares were acquired by the Industry Solutions (IS) division of Siemens AG Siemens - Press release “Siemens VAI Strengthens Its Portfolio of Products and Services: Acquisition of rolling Mill Specialist Morgan Construction completed” April 4, 2008 headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, USA. In 2015 Primetals Technologies, headquartered in London, UK was formed by bringing together Siemens VAI Metals Technologies and Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Metals Machinery (MHMM). Mitsubishi Hitachi Metals Machinery (MHMM), an MHI consolidated group company with equity participation by Hitachi, Ltd. and IHI Corporation, holds a 51 percent stake and Siemens a 49 percent stake in the joint venture.  History  Morgan Construction Company has been building high production, continuous, 2-high hot mills since 1888. These mills were designed to produce wire rod, merchant bars, small angles, skelp, sheet, bar, and billets, and were in operation in practically every country where the manufacture of steel has assumed large enough proportions to warrant this type of mill. As the demands for rolled steel products developed, the speeds and loads of the mills increased, and the problem of adequate roll bearings became more and more acute. First introduced in 1932, MORGOIL bearings were welcomed by the rolling mill industry where roll neck bearing problems were hampering the development of faster and more powerful rolling mills. MORGOIL Bearings provided higher load capacities, higher speed capabilities, lower power consumption, and longer life than existing bearing choices Dahlstrom,F.P., “The Morgoil Roll-Neck Bearing”, Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 1932 or 1933, it has the notation: IS-55-2 MORGOIL Bearings are totally enclosed, precision journal bearings that operate on a hydrodynamically generated film of oil. This oil film has a very high load carrying capacity, and since there is no metal-to-metal contact, wear is negligible.  Concept  The principle parts of a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications depending on the size of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading. These principal bearing components are assembled in a Chock with a Sleeve Ring, Chock End Plate, End Cover and inboard sealing arrangement. The assembly is secured to the roll neck by a Locking arrangement. The original design of the bearing had a long keyed sleeve and a Threaded Ring (TR) lock. This was the typical design through the 1950s when the Quick-Change (QC) mechanical lock was introduced. Short-key and keyless KL® bearings were introduced in the late 1970s to reduce roll force variation and allow the mill operators to produce a higher quality product.  Focus  While most focus in the bearing is on the load carrying components, locking is equally as important since these components must be held securely on the roll neck. HB (hydraulic bayonet) locking was introduced in 1980 provides safe and repeatable performance. Later locking concepts such as the RM (removable mount) and CB (compact bayonet) have been more recently introduced, but they all share hydraulic mount and dismount functions. In 2001 the first major upgrade to bearing capacity was introduced with the MORGOIL KLX® bearing. This bearing uses thin sleeve technology to increase the load bearing area of the radial bearing, allowing more force to be carried in the same space as compared to older designs. The entire axial assembly of this family of bearing was also upgraded to function properly at the increased loads allowed by use of the KLX.  Oil Film Theory as applied to MORGOIL Bearings  The typical MORGOIL tapered neck bearing assembly consists of a sleeve with a non-locking tapered bore that facilitates removal of the bearing chock assembly from the roll neck. The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the roll neck by means of the push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation. The bimetal bushing, which is locked into the bore of the chock, has a high tin Babbitt lining in a steel shell. Loading of the bearing is always vertical, with the load bearing section at the top of the upper bearing and at the bottom of the lower bearing. The bearing lining is undercut on the horizontal centerline (the rebore) so that oil entering the bearing is drawn in by the rotation and eccentricity of the journal. Oil is generally supplied to the rebore following the minimum film thickness, then drawn through the unloaded half of the bushing before entering the load zone, where the hydrodynamic oil film and pressure field are formed. The total oil flow is specified to optimize the cooling of the bearing. Oil flow and feed pressure are specified for each individual mill during the design phase and each mill has specific documentation defining these parameters. Design of mill oil film bearings had always been based on the assumption that the bearings followed hydrodynamic theory developed in England by Prof. Osborne Reynolds as described in his paper Reynolds, O., “On the Theory of Lubrication and Its Application to Beauchamp Tower’s Experiments”, Phil. Trans. Royal Society, London, vol 177, pt. 1, 1886, part 1, p. 157-234 ---or --- Papers on Mechanical and Physical Subjects, Macmillan, 1901, vol 2, p.228-310 from 1886. In the 1950s, Raimondi & Boyd published general design tablesA.A. Raimondi and John Boyd, “A Solution for the Finite Journal Bearing and Its Application to Analysis and Design, Parts I, II, III”, Trans. ASLE, vol 1, no 1, pp 159-209, in “Lubrication Science and Technology”, Pergamon Press, New York, 1958. for hydrodynamic bearings which supplanted the more basic approach, but the underlying assumption of hydrodynamic operation remained. Morgan Construction Company built a test stand that held a completely instrumented full size mill bearing in the 1990s. Proprietary research conducted by the Morgan Construction Company from 1999-2001 showed that mill bearings operated on the principals of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHD), where the elasticity of the structure plays a significant role in the size and shape of the pressure field that supports the bearing. In the case of tapered neck bearings, very small deflections in the sleeve in the load zone of the bearing allow the bearing to redistribute the pressure field in a manner that increases support area and significantly reduces peak pressure in the oil film. Oil film thickness is also significantly larger than predicted by hydrodynamic theory.Association for Iron & Steel Technology. The Lubrication Engineers Manual, Third Edition. , 2007, p. 392,393 A bearing that takes advantage of the EHD behavior was introduced in 2001. Called the KLX bearing, it has a thinner sleeve that is intentionally designed to redistribute the load as much as possible during operation, allowing the bearing to support more load than previous designs of the same size.

It has also been described as a migratory subspecies. Describes subspecies peregrinator \\"from the southern Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka\\", says \\"current range...is defined as extending eastward into northern Myanmar and central and south-eastern China\\", and possibly as vagrants in Malaysia, but that their taxonomic status in some regions is uncertain. Other common names for the subspecies include the black shaheenVarious meanigns of Shahin, (archive) and Indian peregrine falcon. The word shaheen in these names may also be spelled as shahin. This species was termed as the black shaheen by falconers to separate it from the true shaheen of Persian literature. Scholars of Persian and the Russian ornithologist Georgi Petrovich Dementiev have noted that the name shaheen in Persian literature actually referred to Falco peregrinus babylonicus. Etymology Shaheen and other variations come from Middle Persian šāhēn (literally \\"majestic, kingly\\") and the given name Šāhēn. Compare Middle Armenian շահէն (šahēn) and Old Armenian Շահէն (Šahēn). It has two meanings in Persian/Farsi: falcon, especially the Barbary falcon. The second meaning is a pointer of a scale.Wiktionairy - ShaheenVarious meanigns of Shahin, (archive) Taxonomy The taxon was formally described by Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1837 as a separate species, Falco peregrinator, based on a juvenile specimen caught on a ship between Sri Lanka and the Nicobar Islands. Its taxonomic status as a subspecies of Falco peregrinus has been controversial for several years. Amidst conflicting views by ornithologists in the mid-19th century, the shaheen falcon was described as three new species: Falco shaheen from south India was described by Jerdon in 1839, Falco micrurus from Nepal and Burma was described by Hodgson in 1844, and Falco atriceps from Northern India was described by Hume in 1869. These three species were generally accepted as distinct until around the turn of the century, when all three were lumped together with Sundevall's Falco peregrinator as Falco peregrinus peregrinator. The subspecies name peregrinator, Latin for a wanderer or habitual traveler, reflects its traveling ability. The common English name shahin should not be confused with the same word in the Indo- European language Persian, the Turkic language Turkish, and the Afroasiatic language Arabic, where it may refer to falcons or a species of falcon. In the Indo-European language Hindi, shahin or shahin kohi (koh refers to a hill) refer to the female of the peregrinator subspecies, while males of the subspecies are referred to as kohila. Description The shaheen is a small and powerful-looking falcon with blackish upperparts, rufous underparts with fine, dark streaks, and white on the throat. The complete black face mask is sharply demarcated from the white throat. It has distinctive rufous underwing- coverts. It differs in all these features from the paler F. p. calidus, which is a scarce winter migrant to Sri Lanka. Males and females have similar markings and plumage; apart from size there is no sexual dimorphism. The birds range in length from 380 to 440 mm. The male is about the size of a house crow (Corvus splendens); the female is larger. Distribution and habitat The shaheen is found in South Asia from Pakistan across to India and Bangladesh in the east and to Sri Lanka, central and south-eastern China, and northern Myanmar. In India, it has been recorded in all states mainly from rocky and hilly regions. The shaheen has also been reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. =Sri Lanka= The shaheen is the local resident species of the peregrine in Sri Lanka where it is uncommon but found throughout the island in the lowlands, and at elevations of up to 1200 m in the hill country, frequenting mountain cliffs and rock outcrops. The sheer cliff faces provide it with nest sites and serve as vantage points from which it can launch aerial strikes against fast-flying birds such as swifts. Sigiriya is a well known site for it. Ecology and behaviour The shaheen is usually seen as a solitary bird, or in pairs on cliffs and rock pinnacles. Peregrines typically mate for life. Because of the size difference between a male and a female, a mated pair generally hunt different prey species. It is adapted to taking prey in the air and can achieve a speed of 240 kmh in level flight; when diving after prey it can exceed speeds of 320 kmh (200 mph). =Feeding= Shaheens mostly hunt small birds, though medium-sized birds such as pigeons and parrots are also taken. Strong and fast, they dive from great heights to strike prey with their talons. If the impact does not kill the prey, the falcon bites the neck of its victim to ensure death. =Breeding= The reproductive season is from December to April. The birds occupy nests on high cliff ledges or in cavities and tunnels. They lay clutches of 3-4 eggs. The chicks fledge within 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest. In India the shaheen has been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and mobile phone transmission towers. Status The conservation status of the shaheen in Sri Lanka is vulnerable. A preliminary population estimate of 40 breeding pairs there was made in 1996, based on a brief survey. The estimate was later corrected to 100 breeding pairs. In culture In Pakistani literature, the shaheen has a special association with the poetry of the country's national poet, Allama Iqbal. It also appears on the official seal of the Pakistan Air Force logo, and is used as a nickname for the Pakistani cricket team. A misprinted 1992 Indian stamp in a \\"birds of prey\\" series showed a picture of an osprey, with the incorrect denomination and the name Shahin Kohila, the Hindi name for female shaheen falcons; one of these stamps sold for £11,500 in a 2011 London auction.

The Institute is strongly associated with collaborative language systems (or Collaborative Therapy), a type of postmodern therapy that works with clients within a cooperative partnership that holds their expertise in high regard, and that encourages them to access their own natural resources to develop solutions to their problems. The Houston Galveston Institute is a sponsor of the International Journal of Collaborative Practices. History The beginnings of the Houston Galveston Institute date back to the 1950s at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas with the federally funded family therapy project to research the Multiple Impact Theory. In 1978, the Galveston Family Institute was established by Harlene Anderson, Ph.D., Paul Dell, Ph.D., Harold Goolishian, Ph.D. and George Pulliam, M.S.W. to meet the demands of mental health professionals seeking to increase their understanding of families and further develop their skills in systems-oriented therapy with individuals, couples, families and groups. From this group, the ideas of Collaborative Language System Theory emerged. The institute officially became the Houston Galveston Institute in the 1990s when the project expanded beyond Galveston. Other contributors are Diane Gehart, Sue Levin, Diana Carleton, Lynn Hoffmann, Tom Andersen, Vivien Burr, John Cromby, Kenneth Gergen, Mary Gergen, Lois Holzman, Imelda McCarthy, Susan McDaniel, Sheila McNamee, Robert Neimeyer, David Nightingale, Peggy Penn, Sallyann Roth, Jaakko Seikkula, John Shotter, Lois Shawver, and Michael White. Collaborative approach This type of approach formed at Houston Galveston Institute takes the unique stance that “problems are not solved, but dissolved in language.” The client is the expert; Anderson & Goolishian. (1992). In K. Gergen & S. McNamee (Eds.) Therapy as Social Construction. Thousand Oaks, California: Sage Publications Collaborative therapy is now recognized as one of the current schools of family therapy and is included in graduate school textbooks. Some of the general philosophic assumptions of the theory are: * Maintaining Skepticism – A critical attitude about how knowledge is ‘known’ * Eluding Generalizations – Avoid the dominant discourse * Knowledge as an Interactive Social Process – Dialectic, conversational knowledge * Privileging Local Knowledge – Persons and communities know themselves * Language as a Creative Social Process – Language creates our knowledge * Knowledge and Language as Transforming – Conversations change people * Postmodern is only One of Many Narratives – One of many languages These assumptions are post-modern in nature and inform the clinical practice of the Collaborative Therapy approach. The following list is of the various impacts that these assumptions have on the therapist and therapeutic relationship. * Mutually Inquiring Conversational Partnership – Therapy as a partnership * Relational Expertise – Client and therapist bring their expertise together * Not-Knowing – Humility before the client * Being Public – Therapist is open with their invisible thoughts * Living with Uncertainty – Enjoy the spontaneity of a conversation * Mutually Transforming – Hermeneutic circle, reciprocal effect on client and therapist * Orienting towards Everyday Ordinary Life – Tap into natural resilience of clients. Collaborative therapy shares similar epistemological roots with Narrative Therapy and Solution-focused therapy. These therapies are similar, yet distinct. An article by Gehart & Paré summarizes the differences between the therapies in the following way: “In collaborative language systems, the “dis- solving” of problems through conversation (Anderson & Goolishian, 1988; Goolishian & Anderson, 1992), in narrative therapy, reauthoring one’s story about the problem (White 2004; White & Epston, 1990), and in solution-focused therapy (SFT), building solutions (Berg, 1994; de Shazer, 1994; Lipchik, 2002)” Current practice The Houston Galveston Institute currently is involved in the use of the Collaborative Approach in training, counseling and researching. The office is located in Houston’s museum district and is serving the community needs while training students from local, national and international programs. HGI also provides various training programs for mental health professionals who want to develop a collaborative and postmodern approach to therapeutic work with individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations and community. International and national affiliates The Institute currently offers an International Certificate in Collaborative Practices program with participation around the world. The program is sponsored by the Houston Galveston Institute and the Taos Institute. It is a response to the numerous practitioners around the world who are interested in expanding their knowledge and competency in collaborative practice. The Certificate Program provides practitioners across disciplines—therapy, organization development, education and research—an intensive, in-depth study of collaborative practices based on postmodern-social construction philosophy. The Program includes the study of the theoretical and philosophical assumptions and their application to practice in a variety of contexts and cultures. The program is offered in Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, China, Mexico, United States, and Canada. In 2009, the International Journal of Collaborative Practices was founded in order to publish the collaborative works developing worldwide.

The large site, a nearly complete village, has been investigated by Professor Bill Waldren. Significant features include houses, a dolmen and a water supply system. It is believed the site was occupied by several families between circa 2500BC to circa 1300BC.

Approximately 2 km North-East from Son Oleza are two further sites that feature in the Time Team programme: the maze and the sanctuary of Son Mas. The site referred to as \\"the maze\\" was likely occupied by a small group of Beaker people, and more extensively during the iron age, as well as the Roman period. They might have used the copper and iron age sanctuary of Son Mas. The sanctuary has a sighting stone. During the copper age, up until about 1700BC, the sanctuary would have offered a view of the Southern Cross framed by a two mountains, and the Time Team speculate that this is of central importance to the site. The Southern Cross was not fully visible from 1700BC onward, and radiocarbon finds indicate that the site was unoccupied for about 400 years until 1300BC.

Branner Library contains more than 125,000 volumes, including 2000 serial titles, most of which are related to the earth and environmental sciences. The library also houses a collection of over 270,000 sheet maps and the Branner GIS facilities and services. History Branner Earth Sciences Library and Map Collections had its origins when Stanford's first faculty member and second President, John Casper Branner, began buying books as an 18-year-old student at Cornell. He continued to acquire books, maps, and reports while at the Pennsylvania and Arkansas Geological Surveys. When he came to Stanford in 1891, he and his wife brought a boxcar full of books, which became the de facto departmental library, with himself also as the university's first librarian. He oversaw its continued growth and use by colleagues and students until he sold it to the University in 1915. He continued to buy and donate books to the collection until his death in 1922. Later, during the tenure of librarian Kathryn Cutler (1939–1979) the library had been moved from its long-time location on the second floor of Geology Corner to its current location in the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building. Building Between 1968-1970, Spencer, Lee & Busse provided architectural design and planning for the building that houses the Earth Sciences library.

Their trial lasted 55 days and involved various challenges by the Nine to the legitimacy of the judicial process. They were all acquitted of the most serious charges and the trial became the first judicial acknowledgement of behaviour motivated by racial hatred within the Metropolitan Police.  March on Portnall Road  Barbara Beese during the demonstration of 9 August 1970 The Mangrove Restaurant was an important meeting space for the black community in the Notting Hill area, including for black intellectuals and activists. It was repeatedly raided by the police, on grounds of drug possession, despite a lack of evidence. In response the black community staged a protest, on 9 August 1970, where 150 people marched to the local police station. Violence between police and protesters led to a series of arrests and after considering a variety of options, including inciting racial hatred under the Race Relations Act and deportation under new immigration rules, they were tried for incitement to riot. The case was thrown out by the presiding magistrate, who found that evidence from twelve police officers showed they equated black radicalism with criminal intent, but the Director of Public Prosecutions reinstated the charges and the Mangrove Nine were re-arrested in a series of dawn raids.  List of the Mangrove Nine  # Barbara Beese # Rupert Boyce # Frank Crichlow # Rhodan Gordon # Darcus Howe # Anthony Innis # Altheia Jones-LeCointe # Rothwell Kentish # Godfrey Millett  Trial  In a departure from previous British Black Power trials, the accused decided not to adopt traditional legal tactics. First, two of them, Jones-LeCointe and Howe, opted to defend themselves. A second novelty was a demand for the trial to be heard by an all- black jury, a tactic they borrowed from trials in the United States where American Black Power activists had cited the 14th Amendment granting equal protection under the law. In the present case, the claim was based on rights enshrined in Magna Carta to a trial by one's peers. This argument was not accepted. However, after rejecting a total of 63 candidate jurors the defendants did finally ensure that two of the twelve jurors were black. By asking candidates what they understood by the term \\"black power\\", the defendants placed their own political stamp on what were judicial proceedings. As evidence emerged, the case turned attention on allegations of brutality and racism in the Metropolitan Police. After a trial lasting 55 days, and jury deliberation of more than eight hours, all were cleared of the main charge: inciting a riot. Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis and Altheia Jones- Lecointe received suspended sentences for lesser offences, including affray and assaulting police officers. = Legacy = In his summing up, the judge said the trial had \\"regrettably shown evidence of racial hatred on both sides\\", a statement the Metropolitan Police attempted, unsuccessfully, to have withdrawn. The trial was highly significant in being the first judicial acknowledgement of racial prejudice in the Metropolitan Police, and it inspired other civil rights activists seeking to take on the legal establishment. It also resulted in the government \\"modernising\\" procedures related to the empanelling of juries.

He was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 26 June 1671, a fellow on 29 July 1675, and was appointed censor in 1677 and 1692. On the death of Sir Thomas Witherley he was named elect on 16 April 1694, delivered the Harveian oration in 1708, was consiliarius in 1707, 1709, 1710, 1711, and 1712, and was elected to the presidency, void by the death of Dr. Edward Browne.

Life Clerk was in Derry during the siege in 1689 and received a bullet wound on his temple, leaving a sore over which he wore a black patch to the end of his days. It was not until after the siege that he began his studies for the ministry. He was ordained in 1697 by the Route presbytery as minister of Kilrea and Boveedy, County Londonderry. In 1721 he was the sole dissent to the synod's 'charitable declaration' enjoining forbearance towards the nonsubscribers to the Westminster Confession. The following year he and two others entered a strong protest against any compromise with the non- subscribing party. This party attacked him in his own presbytery, but though the matter was referred to the synod, the nonsubscribers were too much occupied in defending themselves to proceed with it. Clerk's literary contributions to the controversy were the first on either side which appeared with the author's name. His friends considered his manner of writing not sufficiently grave in tone. 'I don't think,' writes Livingstone of Templepatrick to Robert Wodrow, on 23 June 1723, 'his reasoning faculty is despisable, but I wish it were equal to his diverting one, for I think he is one of the most comical old fellows that ever was.' On 29 April 1729 Clerk resigned his charge and emigrated to New Hampshire. On landing he found that James Macgregor, formerly minister of Aghadowey, and founder of the township of Londonderry on the Merrimack River, had died on 5 March. He succeeded him as minister, and also engaged in educational work. Clerk was a strict vegetarian, but his abstemious diet did not subdue his warlike spirit. Among the quaint anecdotes told of him is one of his criticising to this effect the prowess of St. Peter: 'He only cut off a chiel's lug, and he ought to ha' split doun his held.' Clerk died on 25 January 1735. He was carried to his grave by old comrades at the Derry siege. He married three times, his third wife being the widow of Macgregor. Works He published : *'A Letter from the Country to a Friend in Belfast, with respect to the Belfast Society,' &c.; (Belfast), 1712 (misprint for 1722), 18mo (issued in June 1722). *'A Letter from the Belfast Society to the Rev.

Life  Clerk is said to have been descended 'from famous and noble lineage.' He was educated for a time in 'grammaticals, logicals, and philosophicals among the Oxonians,' though in what college or hall Anthony a Wood was unable to discover. He then travelled on the continent, and became proficient in the French and Italian languages. In Italy he was the intimate friend of the eminent divine and statesman Richard Pace. 'All things were in a manner common between them, and what was by either read or observed was forthwith communicated to each other's great advantage.' On his return to England he obtained the post of secretary to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. At length he, like his patron, was accused of leze majesty, and committed to the Tower of London, where, to avoid public shame, as has been conjectured, he hanged himself in his cell with his girdle on 10 May 1552.

The teacher's attentiveness to the child and the child's outward gaze into what is before her exemplify the interpersonal dynamics of the pedagogical relation. The pedagogical relation refers to special kind of personal relationship between adult and child or adult or student for the sake of the child or student. The pedagogical relation is described by Hermann Nohl, Klaus Mollenhauer, and others in the Northern European human science pedagogical tradition. It has been discussed more recently in English by Max van Manen, Norm Friesen, Tone Saevi and others.. In the pedagogical relation, adult and child encounter each other in ways that are different from other relationships (e.g., friendship) *In the pedagogical relation the adult is directed toward the child. The relation is asymmetrical.. The adult is \\"there\\" for the child in a way that the child is not \\"there\\" for the adult. *In the pedagogical relation the adult wants or intends both what is good for the child in the present and in the future. This relationship is oriented to what the child or young person may become (without trying to predetermine it), but without ignoring what is important for the child in the present. These two, present needs and the likely requirements of the future, exist in constant tension this relation. *The pedagogical relation comes to an end. The child grows up and the asymmetry of the relation dissolves. As Klaus Mollenhauer explains, \\"upbringing comes to an end when the child no longer needs to be \\"called\\" to self-activity, but instead has the wherewithal to educate himself.\\" *In the pedagogical relation the adult is tactful. It is not about following rules and guidelines, but rather, about acting and also not acting according to what is appropriate for both the present and the future of a specific child in question. *In the pedagogical relation, the adult mediates the relationship of the child with the world. This can happen by protecting the child from certain aspects of the world; it often happens by simplifying certain aspects of the world for the child, by directing the child's attention through gestures of pointing and guiding. In a text from 1933, educationist Herman Nohl describes the pedagogical relation as a relationship between a particular stance of the educator in relationship to the one being educated (educand): The pedagogical relation, finally, has as its interest not necessarily the \\"success\\" of the student, but rather their \\"subjectivation\\"--their becoming a subject, a person, something that is to be pursued as an end in itself.

Plot summary The story unfolds around presidential elections and Holy Week in the year 2000, which is to say, in a period after the internal confrontations caused by the civil war that took place in Perú in the decades of the eighties and the nineties. Nonetheless, the after-effects of this clash are evident in the novel as is discussed. The main character, Associate District Prosecutor Félix Chacaltana Saldívar—who as associate district attorney attempts to investigate serial murders supposedly related to resurgent terrorists of Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), despite lacking direct, first-hand experience with the armed conflict that battered the country—upon whose return to Ayacucho and while in the pursuit of his duties becomes involved with people that definitely have had experience with Senderistas like Edith, the daughter of terrorists; with Hernán Durango (a jailed terrorist) and Commander Carrión. Associate District Prosecutor Félix Chacaltana Saldívar appears at first as someone who has great faith in the formality of procedures. He is organized, precise and pedantic to a “T”, with high regard for proper grammar—in a word, he is \\"anal\\"; he is intellectual and even ingenuous, to a certain degree, until he goes about uncovering corruption that exists in different procedures in which he is directly involved: for example, the presidential elections or usurpation of authority. Thus it dawns on him that he is able to use his authority for his own designs and file reports that have nothing to do with reality. The novel's ending chronicles his tragic, yet at times comical, descent into madness. Narrated in a lineal manner the novel thus begins with the report on the first murder that was carried out and from which there will come a series of murders that the assistant district attorney investigated. From this point on the different events of the story will become known owing to conversations the main character has with others and the reports filed by this prosecutor. One ought to be reminded that the novel can be understood as a place where different facts are given expression, on one hand as a faithful rendition as they took place, or by use of fiction on the other. Upon reading one can find that the novel reviewed touches on topics that positively have occurred and are validated in detailing events of Uchuraccay, the Quechua Indian myth of the Inkarrí as related cogently by Father Quiroz, festivals like the fertility rite and Turu pukllay (indigenous bullfight) “The prosecutor thought about the festival of Turupukllay (turu pukllay). The Incan condor lashed by the claws to the back of a Spanish bull. The bull shudders violently while shedding blood, shaking the enormous yet terrified vulture that pecks at his head and claws at his back. The condor tries to free itself, the bull tries to pound it and knock it off. The condor usually wins the struggle, a winner that is scraped and wounded.” (cf., photo ), the Holy Week processions, in mentioning the terrorist practice of hanging dogs from street lamps. The author also bases a character named Edith, albeit quite loosely, on an actual Senderista martyr of the same first name (Edith Lagos), who was the daughter of a prosperous local businessman and sprung from jail in a Senderista raid on the Centro de Reclusión y Adaptación Social (CRAS) de Huamanga (Penitentiary and Social Change Center of Huamanga). These events definitely occurred in the past and such facts still exist in Ayacucho, and are not a figment of the writer's imagination. A question arises from this commentary: is this novel a resource for historical facts? One should be cautious and keep in mind that the author is not obliged to narrate facts according to the truth; but rather it depends on how he wishes to handle it, by exaggerating it or playing it down. Besides, one should keep in mind the author's note that says: > “The methods for Senderista attacks described in this book, as well as the > counterterrorism strategy of investigation, torture and making people > disappear are real. Much of the characters’ dialogue is, in effect, quoted > from documents from Shining Path or from the statements of terrorists, > officials and members of Peruvian armed forces who took part in the > conflict. The dates for Holy Week in 2000 and the description of the > celebration are also true. Nevertheless, all of the characters as well as > the majority of situations and places mentioned here, are fiction, including > the factual details that have been removed from context of place, time and > meaning. This novel narrates, as do all, a story that could have happened, > but the author does not attest to it having been thus.” In other words, maybe the events happened, maybe they did not. Along another plane, the narrative stage upon which Red April unfolds is in Ayacucho: > “Ayacucho is a strange place. The seat of the Wari culture was here, and > then the Chanka people, who never allowed themselves to be subjugated by the > Incas. And later were the indigenous uprisings because Ayacucho was the > half-way point between Cuzco, the Inca capital, and Lima, the Spaniards’ > capital. And independence in Quinua (cf., Quinua, Peru). And Sendero. This > place is condemned to be bathed in blood and fire forever, > Chacaltana.”(Roncagliolo, p. 245 Spanish edition). Although there is a slight relation to the capital city, given that the main character despite having been born in the southern city, at the age of nine departed to be reared by relatives in Lima after his mother's death, but later decides to voluntarily return to his place of birth. His opinion of Lima is not very high since he considers it quite competitive, the source of popular consensus and, at the same time, full of smog, and arid gray hills in some parts. Ironically, the protagonist finds his roots planted in Ayacucho, Lima and Cuzco, the latter city being the birthplace of his estranged father and deceased mother. Literary fiction, folklore and anthropology The novel spins thematic currents by interweaving the writer's creative story telling content of a thriller novel with the context of Andean life and world view, and the elements Pre-Columbian Incan anthropology. = Maternal Relationships = Associate District Prosecutor Félix Chacaltana Saldívar was very aware of his mother's (mamita) presence, from whom he asked for advice and consent. Likewise he held eerie conversations with her in the ancestral estate, perhaps, of her refurbished home, despite her being dead, as a sort of intermediary of the past and the present in a modern form of Incan ancestor worship, an important element in Andean life.\\"The closeness of the relationship between the Coya (i.e., the Inca’s sister-wife) and Mother Earth is illustrated in Murúa’s account, in which he describes how Huayna Capac set up his mother’s mummy as an oracle for Pacha-mama in Tomebamba.“When Huayna Capac perished of a mysterious disease in Ecuador around 1527, retainers mummified his body and carried it back to Cusco. Members of the royal family frequently visited the deceased monarch, asking his advice on vital matters and heeding the replies of the oracle sitting at his side. Years after his death, Huayna Capac remained the owner of Quispiguanca and the surrounding estate. Indeed, royal tradition dictated that its harvest keep his mummy, servants, wives, and descendents in style for an eternity.” Perhaps his consciousness of her may be due, as will come to light, to the fact that he did not rescue her from the house fire that cost his mother her life. One may also note the desperation of certain mothers upon the disappearance of their sons. In Red April, the mother of Edwin Mayta Carazo was always present at the opening of burial pits in hopes of finding her son's body. = Paternal Relationships = The relationship between the protagonist and his father is extremely distant since Chacaltana assures that he never met his father and neither did he ever inquire about him. It's almost as if he never had had a father. It later becomes known that his father exhibited violent behavior toward his mother and Félix as a child, and who would later wind up threatening him. It is through the eyes of Commander Carrión, who bares uncanny witness to an unusual wealth of detail of the protagonist's childhood, that Chacaltana comes to reveal the nature of his early relationship with his father. He is reminded of the childhood psychological horror in hand-written notes penned in crayon and fractured syntax—in stark contrast to the pedantically precise legal briefs and reports Associate District Prosecutor Félix Chacaltana Saldívar strives to produce—that the killer(s) ostensibly composes after each murder and are strung out over the novel's trajectory, which are accidentally spilled from a briefcase belonging to a prime suspect.

The Catholic Church gets a particularly lively ragging for its combination of simony and superstition as represented by the put-on parish priest (Rogério Cardoso) and a domineering bishop (Lima Duarte) no less self-interested than him—while a larger than life bandit Severino de Aracaju (Marco Nanini), who attacks the town and slaughters the inhabitants, is ultimately forgiven by Jesus in a posthumous denouément set in Heaven. There the fate of the main characters is mercifully arbitrated by in a court-room contest between Satan and Jesus, with the Virgin Mary (Fernanda Montenegro) interceding as the Virgin in keeping with her prayer- book promise. Odd and extravagant as this tacked-on scene is, it conveys the morality of the film better than the antecedent scenes since every character manages to reveal a saving grace as well as demonstrating the unforgiving harshness of the Nordeste environment which they all share and endure in different ways. Last to die in the bandits' onslaught is João himself—given as \\"Jack\\" in the English subtitles—which contain many idiomatic expressions. An intensely witty and ingenious rogue in the best picaresque tradition, he contrives to spin everyone around his finger throughout the narrative and ends by getting Severino to order his side-kick to shoot him dead so that he can meet his revered saint in heaven for some minutes on the understanding that a miraculous harmonica which João has ingeniously convinced him possesses the power of bringing the dead back to life—in this case Chicó rigged up with a little balloon of blood—will effect his speedy resurrection. In heaven with the rest, João is more or less master of his fate and manages to down-face the Devil himself (Luis Melo) in the little matter of eternal damnation. With becoming modesty he refuses to claim any personal virtues and turns down the Virgin's offer of a purgatorial sentence but accepts instead the compassionate offer of a return to earth to 'sin no more'—but do not expect a pious conversion! His resurrection coincides with the moment when Chicó is digging him a sandy grave, triggering a comical mixture of dismay and joy as he rises from the wagon on which he has been laid out in death. Together the two donate their ill-gotten gains from the other deceased characters to the Virgin, to whom Chicó promised such a recompense if his friend came back to life—hardly expecting that he would. Now they proceed with Plan B: to get Chicó married to Rosinha, the daughter of the landlord. Here a marriage bargain involving a lump-sum payment or the skin off Chicó's back is foiled by reference to the legal contrivance familiar from The Merchant of Venice of William Shakespeare—that is, the skin may be owing but not a drop of blood must be taken with it. João, Chicó and the bride now make their escape and enter gleefully into a life of penury on the dusty roads of the region, only to meet with a beggar of dark complexion whom we know to be Jesus. It is the bride—now reduced to penury for the first time in her existence—who breaks bread with him while the others philosophise about Jesus's propensity to test the faithful and just in such a way. At the same time they playfully doubt that Jesus could have been so brown—as João puts it while still in Heaven—reiterating the anti-racist message of the script and its original. The film wanders in and out of realism, commedia dell'arte and Morality Play but consistently holds the focus on the realities of Brazilian life in the 1950s period when the original text was written. When the exoneration of the desperate bandit Severino is delivered by Jesus at the behest of his Holy Mother, a series of black-and-white stills of rural poverty in the Nordeste Brazil are screened, giving the whole a sense of social feet-on-ground which belies its comic brio. In spite of plot variations, the film is extremely faithful to the comic spirit and moral ethos of its literary source, and remains a classic of Brazilian cinema with a faithful audience in the region where it is set—an audience that knows every line, every jape and every twist of the busy plot. It deserves to be better known worldwide if only for the performances (without exception) but requires, to some extent, a specifically Brazilian sense of context for its sympathetic appreciation. Even in that context, the Nordeste sentiment is markedly in the ascendant.

Early life Corbin was born on October 26, 1824 in Willington, Connecticut. He was the third of ten children. When Corbin was seven, the family moved to Farmington, Connecticut, then to West Hartford, Connecticut and finally settled in Ellington, Connecticut. When he was age 15, the family returned to their homestead known as Corbin's Corners, in West Hartford. There, Corbin and his brothers worked on the family farm, were contracted to other farmers, and attended district schools. Corbin attended the West Hartford Academy. At age 19, Corbin secured a position in a New Britain hardware factory.  Early work  In March 1844, Philip Corbin began working for the Matteson, Russell & Erwin Company (later Russell & Erwin). In the fall of 1844, Corbin worked for Henry Andrews, who had secured a contract to make locks for North & Stanley. At the Henry Andrews Company Corbin, apprenticed and learned the art of lock making. Later, he obtained a contract for himself with North & Stanley. With the contract, Corbin's brother Frank joined him in New Britain. Soon after, they formed the P&F; Corbin Company.  Founding the P&F; Corbin Company  P. and F. Corbin factory P&F; Corbin Company, Decorative Hardware In June 1848, Corbin married Francina T. Whiting. The couple had three children, two of whom survived. They later adopted a daughter. At the end of 1848, the Corbin brothers sought a partner for P&F; Corbin. In a small factory built by Corbin's father-in-law, the brothers, along with Edward Doen, began their first manufacturing firm. The first items produced at the factory were ox balls for the horns of oxen and steer. A year later Henry Whiting bought out Doen's interests in the company and the firm became known as Corbin, Whiting and Company. By 1851 the Corbin brothers had purchased Whiting's interest and the firm became the P&F; Corbin Company. The company shared a building with the owners of the North & Stanley Company that owned their premises. In 1853, several North & Stanley directors, including John Butler Talcott also became directors of P&F; Corbin. Through the latter half of the 19th century, P&F; Corbin manufactured builders’ hardware including coat and hat hooks, sash fasteners, picture nails, locks, knobs, as well as coffin trimmings. In early 1870, the company switched to decorative hardware. Many prominent buildings from Boston to Philadelphia, including the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford, are outfitted with Corbin decorative hardware.Lawson, Harvey M. History and Genealogy of the Descendants of Clement Corbin of Muddy River (Brookline), Mass. and Woodstock, Conn. Hartford: The Case, Lockwood, and Brainard Co., 1905.  Other business  Corbin was the president of the P&F; Corbin Company, the American Hardware Corporation, Corbin Cabinet Lock Company, the New Britain Machine Company and the Porter and Dylon Company. He was vice president of the New Britain Savings Bank, Director of the Hartford National Bank, the Mechanics National Bank in New Britain, and the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company of Hartford. Corbin served as warden of the borough of New Britain before its incorporation, was a member of the city council, head of the Water Commission and was responsible for the supervision of the enlargement of the city's water supply. He was involved with the South Congregational Church in New Britain and served as the chairman of the Societies Commission. Early on, Corbin was a dedicated Whig party member. He later joined the Republican Party upon its organization. Corbin did not see himself in political life, yet he was elected to the State Legislature in 1884 and in 1888 was made a member of the State Senate.  Death  Corbin died after a long illness on November 3, 1910 at age 86. At the time of his death, Corbin's companies employed over 1,800 people and were major manufacturing centers in New Britain, even starting an automobile manufacturing company. The P&F; Corbin Company eventually merged with other local manufacturers and became the American Hardware Corporation. Black and Decker purchased the company in 1989. In 2010, the Stanley Works, also of New Britain, purchased Black and Decker, now called Stanley Black & Decker.

Family Tindal was born in Dublin, the son of Commander Ralph Tindal-Carill-Worsley, RN and Kathleen, daughter of Simon Mangan of Dunboyne Castle, HM Lieutenant for County Meath from 1895 to 1905. Tindal was born to a distinguished family. Amongst his ancestors were Lord Chief Justice Sir Nicolas Tindal, Erasmus Darwin, and Charles Worsley. His father and uncle, Charles Tindal-Carill-Worsley, had both served on the Royal Yacht and went on to have distinguished careers in the Royal Navy, Charles commanding HMS Prince George during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 At the same time, Tindal's maternal grandmother's first cousin, Brigadier General Paul Aloysius Kenna, VC, was commanding a brigade in the invasion of Suvla Bay, where he was killed in action in August 1915.CWGC entry Early life He was educated at Beaumont College, a Jesuit public school in Berkshire, and Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, before reading Botany at Trinity College, Dublin. While at Trinity, he befriended Oliver St John Gogarty and learned to fly. Military career =Pre-war= He was commissioned as a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force in 1931. He was promoted to flying officer in 1933, and subsequently to flight lieutenant, before promotion to squadron leader in 1938. Tindal's first cousin, Geoffrey Tindal-Carill-Worsley also served in the RAF during the Second World War, retiring an air commodore. His kinsman, Wing Commander Archie Tindal, was the first Australian airman to be killed on the Australian mainland in the war and gave his name to an RAAF air base. In the mid-1930s, while stationed at RAF Grantham, Tindal played rugby for Leicester. He was also twice capped for the RAF, playing against the Royal Navy at Twickenham in 1933 and 1934.History of RAF Rugby 1919-1999 by John Mace (The Royal Air Force Rugby Union, 2000) Tindal became a flying instructor in 1938, where his students included such future flying aces as Stanford Tuck. =Second World War= From the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he served with 14 OTU and then he commanded 44 Squadron flying handley Page Hampden bombers. He was shot down on 11 December 1940 at Châteaubriant in occupied France, together with Sergeants E Martin, J McEwan and RP Tebutt. All were taken prisoner and Tindal was eventually imprisoned at Stalag Luft III, where he spent the rest of the war. Great Escape His particular responsibility preceding the Great Escape was to forge the documents of the escapers. He had originally been on the list of airmen due to escape from the camp in the daring enterprise, but had given his place to a Polish airman whose wife was due to give birth in England. This man was shot along with other airmen at the direct orders of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, an order that was one of the pieces of evidence most critical in securing Göring's conviction at the Nuremberg trials. Tindal had had his own escapes - once escaping in German uniform for eight days, before being caught near Hamburg. For his many escape attempts, Tindal was twice mentioned in Dispatches. =Post-war= Tindal was promoted to group captain in 1946, with seniority to July 1945. He was appointed commandant of an RAF base in Treviso, Italy, in 1945, before being appointed to a staff position in Palestine, until his retirement in 1948. While in Jerusalem, where he was stationed with his family, Tindal narrowly escaped the King David Hotel bombing, on 22 July 1946. Tindal retired to County Donegal in Ireland in 1949, where he bought a country house and farm. He was an early pioneer of fruit farming in Ireland, until his orchards were destroyed by Tropical Storm Debbie in 1965. Personal life On 27 June 1936 Tindal married Winifred (1913–1997), daughter of Major Henry Cooper, Green Howards, joint master of the Belvoir Hunt, and they had seven children: Charles (m. Rosemary Dennehy, granddaughter of Sir Cecil Stafford- King-Harman, Bt, of Rockingham), Penelope (m. Henry Clark, colonial officer and MP for Antrim North (1959–1970)), Francis (m.

It was the fifth album released by Jewish-American bi-polar outsider musician, Steve Lieberman on 18 October 2004. He was 46 years old when the CD was released. The album title is a play on a Biblical verse in Isaiah 29:21 ' (the wicked) lay a snare for the arbiter (judge) at the gate' (by changing to \\"arbeiter\\" it becomes Yiddish for \\"worker\\"). Of Lieberman's 22 releases to date, Arbeiter At The Gate still remains a top album pick of the AllMusic Guide Arbeiter had charted on a number of college radio stations, most notably peaking at #42 on WXDU Duke University and #87 at KZSU Stanford University. It was while on tour for the Arbeiter album that a reporter from Newsday interviewed Lieberman at one of his shows and stated that the essence of his music is (Lieberman's) message and emotion, not his talent in an article about outsider musicians on Long Island published on 27 February 2005. The record is considered darker than his works preceding Arbeiter as Lieberman suffered a bi-polar dark cycle through much of the cd's production, dealing with the illness of his beloved Labrador mix Buttons, who passed just before Arbeiter's release. Critical reception Greg McIntish from AllMusic wrote: ' A lo-fi sonic sock in the gut built around Lieberman's ultra-fuzzed-out bass, multitudinous flute overdubs and other sundry sounds. Certainly outsider music there's no doubting that Lieberman's sound is unique, but like such artists as Wesley Willis it is completely stagnant... Mostly, the appeal of Arbeiter At The Gate and all of Lieberman's work is the sheer and impressive fearlessness of it. Rating 3.5 Stars out of 5 NeuFutur Magazine's James McQuiston noted: 'Although vocally, sometimes achieving an Ozzy-like inflection, the production and mixing of Arbeiter is almost painful to listen to because of the overdoing of the cheesy distortion Lieberman loves... Steve is unique, that much can be said. He's trying to make a coherent yet different album which doesn't necessarily make for solid, listenable music. But i sense here an evolution that eventually, we could get a solid album from him. Rating 4.0 Stars Out of 10.

It is effective against both first and second stage disease. Some evidence also supports its use in Chagas disease. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects may include QT prolongation, psychosis, and low white blood cells. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breast feeding is safe. Fexinidazole is in the antiparasitic and the nitroimidazole family of medications. It is believed to work by turning on certain enzymes within the parasites that result in their death. Fexinidazole was first described in 1978. It was given a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency in 2018. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Development for sleeping sickness was funded by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative in collaboration with Sanofi. Medical use =Sleeping sickness= A trial in Africa found fexinidazole to be 91% effective at treating sleeping sickness. Though less effective than nifurtimox with eflornithine in severe disease, fexinidazole has the benefit that it can be taken by mouth. Fexinidazole is the first drug candidate for the treatment of advanced-stage sleeping sickness in thirty years. =Other= It has activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, Tritrichomonas foetus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Trypanosoma brucei. It has not been found to be useful for visceral leishmaniasis. Mechanism of action The biologically relevant active metabolites in vivo are the sulfoxide and sulfone. History Fexinidazole was discovered by the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG, but its development as a pharmaceutical was halted in the 1980s. Society and culture Fexinidazole Winthrop, a Sanofi- Aventis product developed with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), received a positive endorsement from the European Medicines Agency in 2018, for use in non-European markets.

The antagonistic characters appear as various deities from Greek mythology, who rule over the realms that form Earth, and their servants who form part of their armies created to wage war against Athena, the protector of the Earth realm. In addition, several factions aren't presented as soldiers of these armies, but as organizations who pursue their own ends. Black Saints The . alternatively spelled as in the anime, appear as servants of the Bronze Saint Phoenix Ikki, on his quest to kill all the Bronze Saints. The Black Saints are former Saints who were stripped from their title and Cloth for using their strength for personal gain, turning to a life of crime and violence. All of them trained in Death Queen Island along with several sons from Mitsumasa Kido, but most of them died. Although there is a Black Saint counterpart for each one of the 88 constellations, Kurumada featured prominently only four in his manga, the dark equivalents of the protagonists: voiced by Shigeru Nakahara, voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa, voiced by Ken Yamaguchi and voiced by Kazumi Tanaka. They were regarded as the most powerful among the Black Saints and were collectively known as The . Their Cloths and techniques are counterparts to the ones from Pegasus Seiya, Dragon Shiryū, Andromeda Shun, and Cygnus Hyōga. Although, there is only one counterpart of each Cloth, in the manga the Black Dragon Saint has a blind brother that helps him to fight. Additionally, there are also several Black Phoenix Saints, who refer to themselves as Ikki's shadows, although in the anime one of them appears as the strongest one. The four Black Saints are defeated by their equivalents, and in the manga, they are later killed by the Silver Saints, who were meant to kill the Bronze Saints, but mistook them due to an illusion created by Aries Mu. Additionally, the Black Four were featured in the anime-inspired printed side story \\"Nebula Chain – The bond of brothers\\", in which they were given names, Black Pegasus was known as , Black Swan was called , Black Dragon was named and Black Phoenix was called , leaving Black Andromeda unnamed. ;: :Before Ikki, the leader of the Black Saints, who stole the Phoenix Cloth and kept it until it was retrieved by Ikki, who afterward killed him. Blue Warriors The are an order of powerful warriors from the ice lands of Bluegrad (known as Sinigrad in English publication), who also draw their strength from their Cosmo. Their order was formed centuries ago by mighty warriors who, in the same way as Athena's Saints, were capable of rending the skies with their fists and splitting the earth with their kicks. The Blue Warriors were led by , prince of Bluegrad, and protected their homeland against any menaces. They were presented by Kurumada in vol.13 of his manga, in the short story arc, he dedicated to Hyōga, \\"Kōri no Kuni no Natassia Hen\\" (The Chapter of Natassia, from the Lands of Ice). Their only known technique is \\"Blue Impulse\\". The Marine Realm Poseidon and his Mariners as seen in the Saint Seiya anime adaptation In the same way, Athena has Saints, Poseidon has an army that has assisted him since the age of myth, the . With Poseidon's Undersea Temple serving as its base in the , it is formed by hundreds of low-ranking soldiers and commanded by seven powerful warriors known as Generals, whose Cosmo rivals that of a Gold Saint. These Generals don armors called , which are said to be as resilient as the Gold Cloths and are modeled after marine creatures of legend. Their duty is to defend the of the seven oceans (North & South Atlantic, North & South Pacific, Arctic, Antarctic, and Indian) that safeguard the Undersea Temple. The strongest pillar, the , is defended by Poseidon himself. ; : :As in Greek mythology, the Greek god Poseidon is the ruler of the seas, brother of Hades and Zeus. In Kurumada's story, he reincarnates on Earth by taking the body of a chosen member of the Solo family as a vessel for his soul. This Greek family is one of the wealthiest in the world and, enjoying Poseidon's blessing, has held hegemony over the seas for millennia. In the 20th century, the god takes the body of the family's young heir, a teenager named , and strikes the Earth with incessant rains to cleanse it of humans, whom he considers evil and unworthy of the blessings of the gods. He wishes to build a utopian society on top of the ruins once all humans are eradicated and to exact revenge on Athena for having sealed his soul after their last battle, two thousand years before. To this end, he holds Athena hostage in his Undersea Temple with the help of his army. He is ultimately sealed by Athena in her amphora, but later proves that he is not an evil deity, as he awakens briefly to help the Bronze Saints fight Hypnos and Thanatos in the Hades arc by sending them the Gold Cloths. ; : :A loyal servant of Poseidon, bound to him by a debt of life. Thetis was saved by Julian Solo when he was a little boy. She was then a beautiful fish, stranded on a beach, and Julian tossed her back into the sea. During Poseidon's kidnapping of Athena, she served as a mediator between the factions of Poseidon and Athena. Thetis is not one of the Mariner Generals, but a middle-ranking soldier, as she is superior to the Mariner rankless soldiers but subordinate to the Mariner Generals. She was unable to assist the Mariner Generals due to her defeat by Ophiuchus Shaina. The Saint spared her life and Thetis ended rescuing Julian Solo from the collapse of the Underwater Sanctuary after Athena removed Poseidon's soul from him. Thetis turned back into a fish as she died and Julian, upon finding it, let it back into the ocean, finally laying her to rest. ; :The vast majority of Poseidon's army, counted by the thousands. Unlike Athena's and Hades' rankless soldiers, the Rankless Mariners possess mastery over Cosmo to some degree, as they wield low-level superhuman strength and also wear weaker versions of the Scale armors worn by their superiors, the Mariner Generals. =Poseidon's Mariners= The seven most powerful warriors of Poseidon and commander of his army. Endowed with might that equals or surpasses that of a Gold Saint, the Mariner Generals wear the Scale armors, said to be as resilient as the Gold Cloths. ; : :Baian was the protector of the North Pacific Ocean's Mammoth Pillar, one of the eight that kept the water above from drowning the Underwater Sanctuary. He had sworn to protect the pillar at all costs. Pegasus Seiya was the first to reach him and initially struggled with the Mariner. Months before, Seiya had defeated the Silver Saint Lizard Misty, a man that, like Baian, used air currents to render himself invulnerable. With the experience reaped from that battle and his reinforced Cloth, the Saint soundly defeated Baian. ; : :The devoted guardian of the South Pacific Ocean Pillar. Upon Andromeda Shun's arrival, Io tried to deceive the Saint with an illusion of a maiden. This did not work in the end and so they faced each other in battle. Io used attacks that matched the six creatures that made up the Scylla beast from Greek myth, but, after withstanding Scylla's attacks, Shun was able to successfully counterattack each of them. Shun spared Io, but as he prepared to destroy the Pillar with the weapons of the Libra Cloth, Io, compelled by his adamant devotion to Poseidon, jumped in front of the attack to stop it. Io's attempt failed and he was thus killed. ; : :Krishna was the guardian of the Indian Ocean Mammoth Pillar. He employed a golden lance and spiritual power derived from the Kundalini transcendental forces. Dragon Shiryū challenged the Chrysaor Mariner. The lance proved to be too much for the Dragon Saint until he remembered that the spirit of Excalibur laid in his right arm, handed down to him by Shura. Thus he was able to break the lance in half. Krishna was not fazed and meditated to flare his Cosmo to the maximum, unleashing a final attack on Shiryū. The combat ended with Dragon Saint hitting Krishna's Chakra points while losing his sight from Krishna's attack. Krishna was defeated and Shiryū destroyed the Pillar with the help of Kiki. ; : :Known as the \\"hunter of hearts\\" and regarded as the most fearsome Mariner, Caça was responsible for the Antarctic Ocean Mammoth Pillar. He protected it by means of treachery and deception, as he was able to draw from a person's most cherished feelings and turn them against them by masquerading as someone they held dear. He took out Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyōga and Andromeda Shun with his illusions. However, when Phoenix Ikki first arrived, Caça was unable to sense any treasured feelings. He only found one enclosed deep in the Saint's heart. This, however, angered the Phoenix Saint, leading to the Limnades Mariner's death. ; : :Isaac was once a righteous Saint apprentice along with Cygnus Hyōga in Siberia, until suffering an accident while he saved Hyōga from drowning. Isaac lost one of his eyes and was falling to the bottom of the ocean unconscious when the Kraken rescued him and took him to Poseidon's Underwater Sanctuary in the Mediterranean. There he became a Mariner and guardian of the Mammoth Pillar of the Arctic Ocean. Upon the Saints' attack on the Underwater Sanctuary, he came face to face with Hyōga and blamed him for everything that had gone wrong years ago. Cygnus Hyōga eventually overpowered him after unsuccessfully trying to repent to his old friend. As he died in Hyōga's arms, Isaac congratulated his friend for becoming so powerful. ; : :The guardian of the South Atlantic Ocean Pillar and a virtuoso of battle music. During Poseidon's cleansing of the world, the Siren Mariner was ordered to kill the four Bronze Saints, Seiya, Hyōga, Shun and Shiryū, who were comatose in a hospital. He met with Taurus Aldebaran's resistance, but Athena interrupted the battle, ordering Sorrento to take her to Poseidon. He obliged and returned to the Underwater Sanctuary. Later, when the Saints invaded, he faced Andromeda Shun, who after a fierce fight managed to defeat Sorrento and destroy his pillar. During the events, Sorrento became suspicious of the Sea Dragon Mariner, concluding that Poseidon's resurrection and the ensuing war were the results of Sea Dragon's ambition and not Poseidon's. These suspicions were confirmed during Phoenix Ikki's battle against Sea Dragon Kanon. After Athena sealed Poseidon's soul and returned to the surface, Sorrento did the same and sought out Julian Solo, the former host of Poseidon's soul. Together they decided to travel the world and help the people that suffered in the catastrophe caused by Poseidon. Sorrento was still with Julian when Poseidon reawakened and sent help to the Bronze Saints in the battle in Elysion. ; :See Gold Saint Gemini Kanon. The Underworld Realm Hades Shun and his Magnates in the Saint Seiya anime adaptation ; :Voice Actor: Yūta Kasuya (in Shun's body), Akio Ōtsuka (In spirit form and in his true body) :The god who rules the , and Athena's true enemy. Aided by the fearsome Hypnos and Thanatos, his closest subordinates. Both Hades and Athena have engaged each other in a long-standing conflict for domination of Earth, that spans across millennia, sparking bloody Holy Wars in the ages of myth, the 15th, 18th and 20th centuries. Hades, whose beautiful body is the spawn of the union between Cronus and Rhea, was subjected to a traumatic experience in the ages of myth, when he was gravely wounded by Pegasus Seiya's incarnation in that era. Thus, Hades decided to put his true body to rest in the unreachable Elysion, until his dominion over Earth is secured. To be able to incarnate, Hades then chose the body of the purest human in the era of his return, as a host for his divine soul, being Alone his chosen vessel during his incarnation in 1747, and Andromeda Shun in 1990. The god of the Underworld was defeated by Athena and her Saints in each of his incarnations, at the high cost of the Saints' lives and havoc over the land. Particularly bloody have been the encounters between the deities in the 18th and 20th century. During the latter, Hades retreats to shelter himself in the Underworld, believing himself safe from Athena and her Saints, who devise a way to invade Underworld. Determined to achieve domination of Earth whatever the cost, Hades unleashes the Greatest Eclipse phenomenon on Earth, which would conceal the sun, turning the planet in a gelid graveyard and exterminating all life. Against all odds, Hades is later rejected by his chosen vessel Shun, and retreats to the Elysion and captures Athena and places her in the lethal Great Amphora, assuming the Saints would never be able to trespass the Wailing Wall in time to save their goddess' life. He is proven wrong by the Saints' tenacity, and the ruler of the Underworld is forced to revive his true body, dormant for millennia since the ages of myth, and engage the Saints in a final duel to the death, during which Hades is shocked to encounter his feared enemy from the ages of myth reincarnated in Pegasus Seiya. Athena, freed from the Amphora joins her Saints in the battle, and after a brief but costly battle, against all odds, Hades is finally defeated. The mortal world is saved from the Greatest Eclipse and the Elysium collapses, but Seiya was also defeated in the battle, being pierced in the heart by Hades' sword and put into a curse which kept him in a catatonic state. In the manga sequel Next Dimension, Hades is incarnated in Alone's body, a boy that as Shun, has the purest body of the Earth. ; :Voice Actor: Maaya Sakamoto :The woman forever destined to unleash evil on Earth. Pandora is the guardian of Hades' soul and his flesh sister in the 20th century. At a young age, she opened the forbidden box that was sealed by Athena and released Hypnos and Thanatos. She was told that Hades would become her brother and she must protect him until the advent of the final battle. In exchange, they would grant her eternal life. She commands the first wave of Specters to attack the Sanctuary in the name of Hades in the final arc of the manga. She was given a necklace that allows her to travel through different realms, and she has a complex relationship with Ikki due to their past regarding Shun. As Hades's sister, she was his slave and was unable to see fully in color but, after seeing Ikki's iron will, she regained her sense of color and her lost memories. Because she gave Ikki the necklace, she was deemed a traitor and killed by Thanatos. :Pandora also appears during her 18th-century incarnation fulfilling the role given to her as destiny. *Ability: Teleportation, Telepathy, Spear, Ability to summon lightning. ; :Voice Actor: Toshio Furukawa :The god of death and a close servant of Hades, who has fought against Athena's Saints since the ages of myth. He along with his twin brother Hypnos reside in Elysion and see to their god's ambitions. Thanatos, is the more impulsive of the brothers, was quick to attack Athena's Bronze Saints when they arrived in Elysion, deeming their trespass blasphemy. When Thanatos was bruised by Pegasus Seiya, he was personally offended and even went to the lengths of trying to kill the Saint's sister. This did however backfire as Seiya rose to a new level of power, resurrecting his God Cloth and soon defeated the god. ; :Voice Actor: Issei Futamata :The god of sleep, also a close servant of Hades and the twin brother of Thanatos, who has fought against Athena's Saints since the ages of myth. Hypnos was more cautious than his brother and stayed out of the way from Athena's Bronze Saints. He did, however, act when the Saints gained a higher form of power as he thought them to be dangerous to the gods themselves, as he was a witness of the power of the God Cloths in the ages of myth. In his effort to stop Pegasus Seiya he was however halted by the other Bronze Saints as they each successfully resurrected their God Cloths and severely wounded the god. Hypnos lived long enough to sense the moment when Hades true body was awakened, but succumbed to his injuries soon after. ; :Recently introduced by author Kurumada in the complementary story Saint Seiya: Origin and also referred to as , the goddess of violent death, younger sister to Hypnos and Thanatos and subject to servitude to them.

After Pandora and Hades have made their way to the castle, he sets out to finish Aries Shion, Libra Dohko and Pegasus Tenma. With little effort, he overpowers Tenma and thus starts fighting the two Gold Saints.

However, when one of Athena's warriors, the Saint called Lyra Orpheé arrived in hell to free his love, Pharaoh was ordered by Pandora to trick the Saint so that he would remain in the underworld forever and be a part of Hades' army. This led much to Pharaoh's chagrin when Orphee became the new favorite musician of Hades. The Sphinx Specter came to resent the Saint since then and would do anything to reclaim his favored position. When the Bronze Saints of Pegasus and Andromeda arrived at his prison, he sent his beloved pet Cerberus on them but with little effect. The Lyra Saint suddenly interfered and made the Bronze Saints unconscious while saying to the Specter that he was going to dispose of them. Pharaoh didn't believe him completely and followed him, and just as he expected the Saint had tricked him and let the Saints live.

During their encounter, it was revealed that the Gold Saints had killed and disguised themselves as some of the Specters. The Gold Saints was however allowed to pass through the Temple and so, the Specter thought they were also allowed. But Shaka immediately attacked and killed all six remaining Specters. Gigant squirmed with his last breath that those who served Hades would be rewarded with eternal life.

During the fight, he went through two stages of Evolution, from the gel substance to a monstrous caterpillar, to a Chrysalis in which he underwent his final transformation into an entomomorphic human.

As the revived Gold Saints came to Hades castle with Athena's body, Zelos was there to greet them. The Gold Saints disregarded him and Aquarius Camus pushed him aside with his cold winds. Thus, when the revived Saints lay dying on the floor due to their time limit, the Specter took out his frustration on Camus.

The objective was to support the German troops fighting in the city, break Dutch resistance and force the Dutch army to surrender. Almost the entire historic city centre was destroyed, nearly 900 people were killed and 85,000 more were left homeless. The psychological and physical success of the raid, from the German perspective, led the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL) to threaten to destroy the city of Utrecht if the Dutch command did not surrender. The Dutch surrendered in the late afternoon of 14 May, signing the capitulation early the next morning. Prelude During the Second World War, the Netherlands' strategic location between Great Britain and Germany made it ideal for the basing of German air and naval forces to be used in attacks on the British Isles. The Netherlands had firmly opted for neutrality throughout the First World War and had planned to do the same for the Second World War. It had refused armaments from France, making the case that they wanted no association with either side. While armament production was slightly increased after the invasion of Denmark in April 1940, the Netherlands possessed only 35 modern wheeled armoured fighting vehicles, five tracked armoured fighting vehicles, 135 aircraft, and 280,000 soldiers, while Germany committed 159 tanks, 1,200 modern aircraft, and around 150,000 soldiers to the Dutch theatre alone. With a significant military advantage, the German leadership intended to expedite the conquest of the country by first taking control of key military and strategic targets, such as airfields, bridges, and roads, and then using these to gain control of the remainder of the country. The first German plans to invade the Netherlands were articulated on 9 October 1939, when Hitler ordered that \\"Preparations should be made for offensive action on the northern flank of the Western Front crossing the area of Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\\" This attack was to be carried out as quickly and as forcefully as possible. Hitler ordered German intelligence officers to capture Dutch army uniforms and use them to gain detailed information on Dutch defensive preparations. The Wehrmacht launched its invasion of the Netherlands in the early hours of 10 May 1940. The attack started with the Luftwaffe crossing through Dutch airspace, giving the impression that Britain was the ultimate target. Instead, the aircraft turned around over the North Sea and returned to attack from the west, dropping paratroopers at Valkenburg and Ockenburg airfields, near the Dutch seat of government and the Royal Palace in The Hague, starting the Battle for the Hague. While Germany had planned to take control swiftly using this strategy, the assault on The Hague failed. However, bridges were taken at the Moerdijk, Dort and Rotterdam, allowing armoured forces to enter the core region of the Fortress Holland on 13 May. Battle for Rotterdam The situation in Rotterdam on the morning of 13 May 1940 was a stalemate as it had been over the previous three days. Dutch garrison forces under Colonel P.W. Scharroo held the north bank of the Nieuwe Maas river, which runs through the city and prevented the Germans from crossing; German forces included airlanding and airborne forces of General Student and newly arrived ground forces under General Schmidt, based on the 9th Panzer Division and the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, a motorized SS regiment. A Dutch counterattack led by a Dutch marine company had failed to recapture the Willemsbrug traffic bridge, the key crossing. Several efforts by the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade to destroy the bridge also failed. On the Morning of 14 May, Hitler issued his \\"Weisung\\" Nr. 11. Concerning the Dutch theatre of operations he says the following: A painting of Rotterdam in 1895, before the Blitz destroyed the historic city centre The area north of the Maas river was destroyed during the bombing, shown here on an old 1905 map General Schmidt had planned a combined assault the next day, 14 May, using tanks of the 9th Panzer supported by flame throwers, SS troops and combat engineers. The airlanding troops were to make an amphibious crossing of the river upstream and then a flank attack through the Kralingen district.Kriegstagebuch, KTB IR.16, 22.ID BA/MA The attack was to be preceded by artillery bombardment, while Gen. Schmidt had requested the support of the Luftwaffe in the form of a Gruppe (about 25 aircraft) of Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers, specifically for a precision raid. Schmidt's request for air support reached Berlin, staff of Luftflotte 2. Instead of precision bombers, Schmidt got carpet bombing by Heinkel He 111 bombers besides a Gruppe of Stukas focussing on some strategic targets. The carpet bombing had been ordered by Hermann Göring, to force a Dutch national capitulation.; ; ;; ; Bombing Rotterdam's burning city centre after the bombing. Bijenkorf department store – architect Willem Dudok – partly destroyed during the bombing and demolished in 1960 Schmidt used the threat of destroying Rotterdam to attempt to force Colonel Scharroo to surrender the city. Rotterdam, the largest industrial centre in the Netherlands and of major strategic importance to the Germans, was to be bombed. Scharroo refused and stretched out negotiations. The start of the air raid had been set for 13:20 [Dutch time, MET – 1 hr 40]. Schmidt relented and issued a second ultimatum of 16:20. However, it was already too late and just as the Dutch negotiator was crossing the Willemsbrug to relay this information, the drone of bombers was heard: a total of 90 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 54 were sent over the city.; ;; ; Schmidt radioed to postpone the planned attack. When the message reached KG 54's command post, the Kommodore, Oberst Walter Lackner, was already approaching Rotterdam and his aircraft had reeled in their long-range aerials. Haze and smoke obscured the target and to ensure that Dutch defences were struck, Lackner brought his formation down to .. German forces on the Noordereiland fired flares to prevent friendly fire — after three aircraft of the southern formation had already unloaded, the remaining 24 craft in the southern bomber formation under Oberstleutnant Otto Höhne aborted their attack. The larger formation came from the north-east. Unable to see the red flares launched from the southern area of the city, they proceeded with their attack. Fifty-four He 111s dropped low to release 97 tonnes (213,848 lb) of bombs, mainly in the centre of the city.; ; ; ; ; ; ; Rotterdam Blaak railway station and Laurenskerk Why the formation did not receive the order to abort sooner remains a subject of some controversy. Oberst Lackner of the largest formation claimed that his crews had been unable to spot the red flares due to bad visibility caused by humidity and the dense smoke rising from burning structures, and that they had consequently needed to drop to 2,000 feet. But the red flares that Lackner failed to see could have also been used by the Germans to show their location in the city and avoid friendly fire. An official German form designated red as the colour to be used for that purpose.L. Elfferich, Rotterdam werd verraden. Abcoude: Uniepers, 1990. p. 270 In total, 1,150 and 158 of bombs were dropped on the city, mainly in the residential areas of Kralingen and the medieval city centre. Most of them struck buildings which immediately went up in flames. The fires across the city centre spread uncontrollably and in the subsequent days they were aggravated as the wind grew stronger, merging to become a firestorm. Although the exact number of casualties is not known, nearly 1,000 people were killed and 85,000 were made homeless. Around of the city was levelled. 24,978 homes, 24 churches, 2,320 stores, 775 warehouses and 62 schools were destroyed. Schmidt sent a conciliatory message to the Dutch commander General Winkelman, who surrendered shortly afterwards at Rijsoord, a village southeast of Rotterdam. The school where the Dutch capitulated was later turned into a small museum. Aftermath De Verwoeste Stad, (The Destroyed City), sculpture in Rotterdam by Ossip Zadkine The Dutch military had no effective means of stopping the bombers (the Dutch Air Force had practically ceased to exist and its anti-aircraft guns had been moved to The Hague), so when another similar ultimatum was given in which the Germans threatened to bomb the city of Utrecht, the Dutch supreme command in the late afternoon decided to capitulate rather than risk the destruction of another city. Dutch and British sources informed the public through Allied and international news media that the raid on Rotterdam had been on an open city in which 30,000 civilians were killed (the real number was around 900) \\"and character[ised] the German demolition of the old city as an act of unmitigated barbarism\\".; and for the quote. The number of casualties was relatively small, because thousands of civilians had fled to safer parts of Rotterdam, or to other cities, during the previous four days of bombing and warfare. German weekly Die Mühle (The Windmill) stated that the Dutch government was to blame for turning Rotterdam into a fortress, despite multiple summons to evacuate. It also claimed that the old city was ignited by Dutch bombs and incendiary devices.Die Mühle, no.22, 31 May 1940, Moritz Schäfer Verlag, Leipzig Lights along the fire line memorialize the bombing of Rotterdam, 14 May 2007 The United Kingdom had had a policy of bombing only military targets and infrastructure such as ports and railways which were of military importance. While it was acknowledged that bombing of Germany would cause civilian casualties, the British government renounced the deliberate bombing of civilian property outside combat zones (which after the fall of Poland, meant German areas east of the Rhine) as a military tactic. This policy was abandoned on 15 May 1940, one day after the Rotterdam Blitz, when the RAF was directed to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. The first RAF raid on the interior of Germany took place on the night of 15/16 May 1940. Reconstruction Due to the extent of damage from the bombardment and resulting fire, an almost immediate decision was taken to demolish the entire city centre with the exception of the Laurenskerk, the Beurs (trade centre), the Postkantoor (Post Office) and the town hall. Despite the disaster, the city's destruction was regarded as the perfect opportunity to redress many of the problems of industrial pre-war Rotterdam, such as crowded, impoverished neighborhoods, and to introduce broad-scale, modernising changes in the urban fabric which had previously been too radical in built-up city. There seemed to be no thought of nostalgically rebuilding the old city, as it would be at the expense of a more modern future. W.G. Witteveen, director of the Port Authority, was instructed to draw up plans for the reconstruction within four days of the bombing, and had presented his plan to the city council in less than a month. This first plan essentially used most of the old city's structure and layout, but integrated into a new plan, with widened streets and sidewalks. The largest and most controversial change to the layout was to move the main dike of the city alongside the riverbank, so as to protect the low- lying Waterstad area from flooding. This was met with criticism from the newly formed 'Inner Circle of Rotterdam Club', who promoted integrating the city with the Maas River, and claimed the dike would create a marked separation from it. A number of new or previously incomplete projects – such as the Maastunnel and Rotterdamsche bank – were to be completed under Witteveen's plan, and these kept the Dutch people in work during the German occupation of the city, until all construction was halted. Herman van der Horst's 1952 documentary ‘Houen zo!’ presents a vision of some of these projects. During this time, Witteveen's successor Cornelius van Traa drafted a completely new reconstruction plan – the ‘Basisplan voor de Herbouw van de Binnenstad,’ – which was adopted in 1946. Van Traa's plan was a much more radical rebuild, doing away with the old layout and replacing them with a collection of principles rather than such a rigid structural design. The 'Basisplan' placed a high emphasis on broad open spaces and promoted the river's special integration with the city through two significant elements; the Maas Boulevard, which re-imagined the newly moved dike as an 80m wide tree-lined street; and the \\"Window to the River,’ a visual corridor running from the harbour to the centre of the city. Both were meant to show the workings of the harbour to the city's people. Because reconstruction work began so rapidly after the bombing, by 1950 the city had again retained its reputation as the fastest loading and unloading harbour in the world. Around the same time, the city centre of Rotterdam had shifted north-west as a result of temporary shopping centres set up on the edge of the devastated city, and new shopping centre projects like the Lijnbaan were expressing the radical new concepts of the 'Basisplan,’ through low, wide open streets set beside tall slab-like buildings. Rotterdam's urban form was more American than other Dutch cities, based on US plans, with a large collection of high-rise elements and the Maas boulevard and 'Window to the River' functioning primarily as conduits for motor vehicles. In later years, Rotterdam architect Kees Christiaanse wrote: This larger-scale, 'wholesale-quantity' approach was used equally for hospitals and parks (such as Dijkzigt Hospital and Zuider Park) as retail centres, but close attention was still paid to creating human-scale, walkable promenades, especially that of the Lijnbaan, which presented broad sunny walkways for shoppers and spectators, and tried new retail techniques such as open glass walls to blend interior and exterior. While urban reconstruction can be fraught with complexity and conflict, Rotterdam's status as a 'working' harbour city meant it did not receive the same resistance to rebuilding as a cultural or political centre (as Amsterdam or The Hague) might have. However, there was still significant movement of people away from the city centre during Rotterdam's reconstruction to purpose-built neighbourhoods such as De Horsten and Hoogvliet, which are now inhabited by mainly lower-income households. Today, van Traa's 'Basisplan' has been almost completely replaced with newer projects. For example, The Maritime Museum blocks the \\"Window to the River\\", and Piet Blom's Cube Houses create another barrier between the city and river, where in the 'Basisplan' there was to be a connection between them. The Euromast tower built in 1960, is a related attempt at creating a visual link between the city and port, seemingly one of the last related to van Traa's 'Basisplan' before later attempts like the 'Boompjes Boulevard' in 1991.

Original conviction On 27 February 1973, with Peter McVeigh and William Meehan, Corey ambushed members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Aghalee. One RUC officer, Constable Raymond Wylie, was killed instantly. Constable Robert McCauley died on 25 March 1973. In December 1973, Corey and his accomplices were found guilty of both murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released on licence from the Maze Prison in June 1992. From 1995, he worked as a gravedigger. Reimprisonment Corey was taken back into custody on 16 April 2010, after the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Shaun Woodward, applied to the parole commission to have his release licence revoked, based on secret evidence linking Corey to dissident republicanism. Corey is a member of Republican Sinn Féin. The parole commission proceeded to review the evidence at a closed hearing on 25 January 2011 at which a special advocate appointed by Advocate General for Northern Ireland represented Corey. Some evidence was withheld, with only the gist being made available to the advocate. The commission ruled on 15 August 2011 that it was \\"satisfied that Mr Corey had become involved in the Continuity Irish Republican Army from early 2005 and that he was in a position of leadership in that organisation from 2008 until his recall to prison\\". The decision was subject to judicial review by Justice Treacy, who ruled on 9 July 2012 that the hearing's reliance on secret evidence violated Corey's right to due process. Treacy granted Corey bail pending a rehearing by the parole commission. The Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, obtained a stay on Treacy's judgment, appealing it to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. The Appeal court under Declan Morgan ruled that, whatever flaws might be in the parole commission's process, Justice Treacy did not have the authority to release Corey or grant him bail. In December 2013, the UK Supreme Court upheld the Appeal court decision. =Protests= Corey's continued detention in Maghaberry Prison was opposed by Sinn Féin and Republican Sinn Féin, and described as tantamount to internment. The Committee on the Administration of Justice proposed taking the case to the European Court of Human Rights. A website and social media campaign was launched. In May 2012, Corey was initially denied compassionate leave to attend the funeral mass for his brother. On appeal he was allowed to attend the church service, though not the burial, on condition that he be accompanied by Sinn Féin MLA John O'Dowd and lifelong friend and official spokesperson Jim McIlmurray from Lurgan.http://thepensivequill.am/2013/04/three-years-in-jail-on-no-charge.html In August 2012, the Prison Ombudsman determined that pieces of artwork confiscated from Corey by prison staff must be returned to him as they did not, as alleged, contain images that glorify terrorist activities. Release On 15 January 2014, Corey was released from prison under licence. On the instructions of Secretary of State Theresa Villiers he was taken from the prison in a blacked-out van and released into the custody of his solicitor. \\"Rule 22\\" of the parole commissioners' rules prohibits publication of the conditions of such a licence; media reported they included bans on living within 20 miles of Lurgan, speaking to the media, or associating with known members of paramilitary group. His release was welcomed by Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party but criticised by Tom Elliott of the Ulster Unionist Party.

She is recognized as \\"Australia’s first queen of haute couture\\" and specialized in evening and bridal wear, although the term \\"haute couture\\" is not strictly correct in this context as it refers to high-end made-to-measure fashion design. She was noted in hundreds of features in newspapers and advertisements during her career from the 1930s to 1980s and was patronized by socialites and creatives; the majority from Sydney and Brisbane. International clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Gaynor, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Vivien Leigh, Eartha Kitt, Bo Derek and Winifred Atwell. Jents was almost unique as an Australian fashion designer during the '40s and '50s as she did not just copy European or Parisian styles but produced original work. She was recognized by her contemporaries such as Norman Hartnell. Her most notable and original collections include the Potato Sack of 1947 and Pan Am collection of 1948. Important designs included the peg-bottom trousers inspired by the Zoot Suit. Jents' work has been collected by the Powerhouse Museum and the National Gallery of Victoria. Jents died on 8 June 2013 aged 95.Queen of haute couture bows out History Jents came from a modest background in Sydney, born in 1918. She assisted her mother, Alice Strudwick, in dressmaking and thus first learnt her skills at her side, also acquiring her mother’s knowledge of materials. She was an outsider and initially unfamiliar with the high society that she would one day serve. Her next role was as a trainee lithographic artist at Hollander and Govett, Sydney. She then undertook an apprenticeship with Sydney-based French dressmaker Madame Gallet. Here she learnt to cut without a pattern. Gallet closed the business and returned to France in 1934. At the age of 16 Jents opened her studio in Charing Cross, Waverley, Sydney. She then moved to the corner of Newland Street, Bondi Junction. For the following 10 years she produced made-to-measure garments for a select clientele. She was acclaimed for the way she cut and constructed sleeves in jackets. In 1944 the business was formally registered and located in King’s Cross, at the time a very bohemian area. Jents collaborated with Sydney-based actors such as Noël Coward and Sir Robert Helpmann. She designed for the leading theatrical plays of her era including The Reluctant Debutante, Call Me Madam, Simon and Laura and Nude with Violin.'''' At age 32 she opened a new salon in the St James building in Sydney's city centre. In 1952 she was acknowledged as the ‘pre eminent Australian Fashion Designer’ and invited to represent Australia in an international fashion show in New York City where Norman Hartnell represented England and Givenchy represented France. This indicates of the calibre of designers invited to participate. Jents did not advertise, preferring to promote herself though word of mouth recommendations. The media reported on her enthusiastically and regularly. It was they who crowned her “Australia’s Queen of Haute Couture” and in 1972 fashion journalist Glenys Bell hailed her as “the sole survivor of Haute Couture in Australia”. She retired in 1986 - after six decades of work. Inspiration and notable works Jents adapted the looks from Europe and Paris in original designs to suit the Australian lifestyle and dress culture which she described as “much simpler than the European life”. She designed modern clothes which she tried to imbue with a sense of timelessness and as such was well patronised by a younger clientele. Jents was inspired by the rarefied glamour associated with Hollywood films and its stars in the 1930s. The costumes Adrian designed for the 1932 film Letty Lynton were very influential, especially one gown of white organdy with large puffed sleeves which sold over 500,000 dresses in the U.S. Jents reproduced this dress in Australia. She said of the design “It planted in my mind another seed for the future, to go on and create glamourous clothes”. Jents liked to drape fabric on the stand and directly on the body and was also inspired by the Parisian couturière Madame Gres. =Potato Sack (1947)= This collection was an early example of sustainability and recycling in high end Australian fashion. Large hessian potato sacks were purchased from the local green grocer and then Jents would soak them in the bath and boil them in copper in order to soften them and achieve the desired texture. She described this fabric as “like very coarse linen”. She sewed A-line full skirts and beaded and embroidered them with straw work. Academic scholars have suggested parallels with Coco Chanel who used inexpensive jersey fabric for her post World War 1 designs. The entire collection was purchased by Sheila Scotter, buyer at Georges of Collins Street in Melbourne, who was considered an ‘arbiter of good taste’ at the time (as evidenced by her subsequent position as Vogue Australia’s Editor-in-chief.) =Pan Am (1948)= This was a collection designed for air travel with Pan American Airlines. Jents collaborated to design lightweight travel garments for Pan Am’s launch of the Strato-Clipper aeroplane. The collection was black and white and launched in the world’s first in flight fashion show. Notable clients * Mary Horden (Australian Woman’s Weekly fashion editor from 1946–1957).

Ink is a popular agent, which functions by staining cash with a permanent dye released from a dye pack. Such marked money is highly conspicuous and cannot be readily used. More recently, a bonding agent (glue) was released as an alternative degradation agent. Well-neutralised banknotes cannot be brought back into circulation easily. They can be linked to the crime scene and restricted procedures are in place to exchange them at the financial institution. This makes stealing neutralised banknotes uneconomical and impractical. The IBNS removes the anticipated reward of the crime and increases the risk of being caught. This not only foils the theft but acts as a deterrent against further attacks.  History  In Europe the design of intelligent systems to protect valuables began in 1980. The overall goal was to create a secure system to provide additional security for cash-in-transit. The very first IBNS prototype using coloured smoke as neutralisation agent was invented by Spinnaker International Ltd in 1982. This made use of very lightweight and simple to use containers. In 1990, the first case of safety ink as a neutralizing agent was accepted to be used in soft-skinned vehicles. At the same time in Sweden IBNS systems manufactured by Spinnaker, were being used in non-armoured and partially armoured vehicles, demonstrating that this was a viable alternative to cash transportation with armoured trucks. The Swedish market decided to progress with IBNS boxes for cash transport. In 1991 France changed its regulations to allow the use of IBNS in soft-skinned vehicles. The French CIT company VALTIS was the first to implement such a system to service three regional banks. In 2002, Banque de France implemented an international procedure to treat and exchange neutralized banknotes for CIT professionals. In 2003, the European Central Bank made a decision that defined the process and cost of exchanging neutralized Euro Banknotes among all National Central Banks in Europe., DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 20 March 2003 on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes. EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK. In 2005, Banque de France implemented a special procedure regarding the treatment of stained banknotes deposited by private persons. In 2007, Sweden implemented a national regulation making the use of IBNS by CIT obligatory. The same year, the Belgian government also implemented a national regulation imposing the use of IBNS for Cash-in-transit. In 2010, the European Commission finalized a European regulation to harmonize cross- border cash transportation by road. The use of non-armoured vehicles in combination with IBNS is one of two accepted methods of transportation., Commission proposal for an EU Regulation to facilitate professional cross- border transportation of euro cash by road. European Commission  Concept  Money stained with a permanent security ink. The concept of an IBNS is based upon the notion that criminals seek to maximize their reward while minimizing the potential cost of the crime., Barthe, Emmanuel. Crime Prevention Publicity Campaigns. U.S. Department of Justice. 2006, p.9. Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation Systems remove the anticipated reward of the crime and increase the risk of being caught. Reducing the reward of the crime is done by permanently marking the cash as stolen with an indelible security ink or bonding agent. Tracers and markers added to the ink or bonding agent provide forensic evidence linking the criminal to the crime scene, increasing the risk of being caught. IBNS focuses on using technology to protect people, valuables and equipment whilst minimizing the use of weapons and armoured vehicles.  Application  IBNS technology is typically found protecting cash inside ATMs; in retail establishments and vending machines and by the cash in transit industry to protect cash in the public space.  Legislation and regulations  The use of IBNS is usually regulated by the presence or absence of a legal structure (legislation and regulations) as well as the legal conditions applying to the private security sector. The following countries allow neutralisation of national banknotes by the National Central Bank: * Permit the use of IBNS without legal or professional regulation or other restriction: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bosnia, Slovenia, UK, Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland. * Legal regulation permits use of IBNS upon citing the regulation: Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Finland. * Legal regulation permit to use IBNS with technical agreement: Croatia, France, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary, Italy. * Legal regulation forbids unrestricted use of IBNS: Poland, Romania. These countries forbid neutralising of national banknotes by legal regulation or internal regulation by the National Central Bank: Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and others.

Best known for creating one of the first electronic theatre lighting dimming system, over the course of his career he invented and developed multiple technologies at the core of modern theatrical productions. Biography =Early life and education= Born in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, before moving to Ambridge in 1917. In 1918 Izenour's father moved the family to Mansfield, Ohio. Because of a condition known as keratoconus, a non-spherical deformation of the cornea of the eye, George's early education was augmented by his parents at home. His mother taught him English and Latin and his father history and mathematics.George C. Izenour Dies at 94 . Lighting&Sound; America Online. 27 March 2007. Retrieved on 2011-08-23. George did not begin his formal schooling until the age of six in Mansfield. While still living in Mansfield, he appeared in all of the Mansfield Senior High School plays. He painted the scenery for them and became increasingly interested in the technical aspects of theatre. Izenour attended Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio, where he eventually obtained a master's degree in physics. His thesis was the embodiment of what would later become the first electronic theatre lighting dimming system. George married Hildegard Hilt, a classmate from Wittenberg, after graduation and moved to California. =Work= Shortly after moving to California, George met Hallie Flanagan, the national director of the Federal Theatre Project. Eventually, he became the lighting director of the project. While in California, Izenour designed the theatre at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939. Izenour was made a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation on July 10, 1939, 10 days after the House Un-American Activities Committee declared all of the members of the Federal Theater Communists, effectively closing the Federal Theater. With his Rockefeller grant, George Izenour gained a position at Yale University, with the mandate to establish a laboratory dedicated to the advancement of theatre technology. =World War II= During World War II, Dr. Izenour worked on antisubmarine warfare and countermeasures for proximity fuses at a government lab in Long Island, New York. His son Steven Izenour, a world-renowned architect and artist, was born in New Haven in July 1940. =Yale= Resistance dimmer lighting control. After the war he returned to Yale where he developed the Electro-Mechanical Laboratory in an abandoned squash court at the Yale School of Drama Annex under the general direction of Stanley McCandless. He built and installed several dimming systems out of the squash court. Century Lighting became interested in the system, however Izenour refused to sell the patents he had acquired. Century took a license to produce the dimming systems that would be known as the Century-Izenour System. Prior to the development of Izenour's control system, adjusting theatrical lighting was done though bulky control panels located on- stage. For large, complex productions several people would generally be required to operate these control panels. The Century-Izenour control system allowed a single operator, located in the house to control all of the stage lighting remotely. =Theatre design= George Izenour's first theatre consultation began with being contacted by McGeorge Bundy, then Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. Bundy was building a new theatre, that would eventually become the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge, Mass., based on a program from Archibald MacLeish. Mr. MacLeish wanted the theatre to convert from proscenium to thrust because these were, according to Mr. MacLeish, the two great forms of theatre which had to do with western culture.In Memoriam: George Izenour . Usitt.org. Retrieved on 2011-08-23. Izenour designed a theater that could be converted from one stage type to the other by a process, part manual and part electronic, that took about 15 minutes. This convertible design was celebrated in architectural world and became known as an Izenour theatre. Today Izenour theatres exist across the United States, as well as in Canada, Venezuela and Israel. There are no Izenour theatres, however, on Broadway. “Broadway is not for me,” he said in a 1959 interview with The New York Times. “I am a radical to those real estate operators.”George Izenour, 94, Designer of Technologies for Theaters, Dies. New York Times. March 30, 2007. Izenour used the celebrity from this project to launch George C. Izenour Associates as a theatre design and acoustical consulting firm. Through his consultancy firm, George Izenour ended up advising such prestigious clients as the Metropolitan Opera Company and the Juilliard School of Music on technical matters, as well as helping to design more than 100 theatres across the country. > “George really was the father of modern theatre consulting and design,” > remembers Steve Pollock. “Some of his initial project work, such as the > Krannert Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Illinois, > relied on a number of individual spaces to satisfy a broad menu, whether it > be a great hall, an amphitheatre, a studio theatre, and so on.

Izenour lived there until his wife's death in 2002. =Death= From 2002 until his death, Izenour was a resident at Cathedral Village in Philadelphia, where he continued to work on theatre design projects. Technology George Izenour is credited with over 27 patents for various technologies and design improvements his various developments have significantly effected the art of stagecraft and theatre in general. Some of his many contributions to theatre technology include: Patent #2,942,879 Scenery Handling ApparatusG. C.

Aside from the five protagonist Bronze Saints, Kurumada presents six more in his work, described as follows. ; :Voice Actor: Kōsuke Meguro, Hideo Ishikawa (OVA), Akie Yasuda (child), Vic Mignogna (English), Sasha Paysinger (child, english) :The second Bronze Saint to appear in the story was Jabu the Unicorn Saint. As a fellow orphan he had been sent out with 99 more of his brothers by their father Mitsumasa Kido. He achieved the Cloth of Monoceros the Unicorn in Algeria and returned to Japan to participate in the Galaxian Wars tournament to receive the Gold Cloth of Sagittarius. He easily defeated Lionet Ban in his first match but was outmatched against Andromeda Shun whose chains proved impenetrable. He returned to his master in Algeria to further his training, and during this time his Cloth came to upgrade itself as well. When Saori Kido had been shot by a golden arrow, he came to her rescue and protected her from the then antagonistic forces of the Sanctuary. After that he came to reside in the Sanctuary and protected it against the Saints Hades had revived, and protected Pegasus Seiya's sister Seika from the attacks of the god of death. ; :Voice actor: Masato Hirano, Masaya Onosaka OVA, John Swasey (English) :Hydra Ichi was like the other Bronze Saints that participated in the Galaxian Wars a fellow orphan. His and the other Bronze Saint's father Mitsumasa Kido was the founder of the Graud foundation. After being taken from the orphanage by Mitsumasa he was sent out to train in Finland to become a Saint of Athena. He came back years later to participate in the Galaxian Wars that were now held by Mitsumasa's adopted granddaughter Saori Kido. In his first match Ichi had to battle Cygnus Hyōga. The Hydra Saint underestimated his opponent who froze him to near death. Ashamed by his defeat, he asked Saori for permission to undergo further training in Finland with his master. She agreed and thus Ichi didn't reappear until Saori was put in danger in Sanctuary after being struck by a golden arrow. From then on, he served her as Athena and came to reside in Sanctuary.

They possess advanced mastery of Cosmo, which enables them to attain speeds ranging from mach 2 to 5, and also grants them tremendous physical strength. When they receive an assignment from the Sanctuary, they go to any part of the world to fulfill it, whatever the cost, using all their power. They represent the true concept of a Saint of Athena. Another of their responsibilities is to take care of the Cloths that do not have owners. It is common to find Silver Saints training potential candidates to gain one of these Cloths. As many Saints and Cloths were lost in the last Holy War, training new Saints and increasing the ranks are important tasks to be fulfilled before the next Holy War.Saint Seiya Encyclopedia, page 61 The Silver Cloths are more beautiful and stronger than Bronze Cloths. They freeze at a temperature of -200 °C. Currently there have only been eighteen Silver Cloths confirmed, however, the Silver Cloths of Orion, Shield and Southern Cross, created by Masami Kurumada for the first Saint Seiya theatrical release, as well as their bearers, are considered canonical. The seventeenth and eighteenth Silver Cloths were revealed in the Saint Seiya Encyclopedia; they represent the constellations of Crateris and Ara, although the latter has never been featured in any arcs of the manga to date.

She instructed him in the ways of the Saints with a stern hand and strict discipline, enabling him to cultivate his enormous potential. Due to the code of the female Saints, Seiya never had the chance to know her mentor's facial features, as she always concealed her behind her mandatory mask. Although Seiya endured hardships during his training, he and Marin bonded strongly. Due to Marin's physical appearance, her pupil Seiya long wondered if she and her long-lost sister, Seika were one-and-the same, a question that would take time to be answered as Marin was aware of the machinations of the false Pope of Sanctuary and involved herself in the rebellion to overthrow him. Marin assists Seiya and the Bronze Saints in their battle against the Silver Saints, after which she disappears temporarily. During this absence, Marin made shocking discoveries when she entered, at the risk of her life, the forbidden place known as Star Hill, learning the truth about the false Pope and his rise to power. She reappears during the climax of the conflict of the twelve temples, saving Seiya's life and helping him to reach the Pope's chambers.

Shaina was mentor to Pegasus Seiya's rival Cassios, whose defeat seemingly caused Shaina to bear a grudge against Seiya. At first, Shaina served the false Pope of Sanctuary, as she was determined to take Seiya's life for the humiliation she caused her, but later, suspicion towards him grew in her, which led her to side with the Bronze Saints in their rebellion against Sanctuary. Shaina saved Seiya's life from Leo Aiolia, sent by the Pope to kill him; being gravely wounded herself, she revealed that her grudge derived not from the fact that Seiya defeated Cassios, but because Seiya was the first man to ever see Shaina's face, the worst offense against a female Saint. Rigid tradition forced female Saints to either of two choices: either kill the offender or fall in love with him, Shaina unwillingly choosing the latter. Convalescing during the conflict of the twelve temples, Shaina is shocked to learn about her pupil Cassios' death to save Seiya's life, to spare her from grieving. Shaina then saves Eagle Marin's life, who moments before had saved Seiya's in the funeral roses stairway. After the false Pope is defeated, Shaina pledges her loyalty to Athena. Despite her love towards Seiya being unrequited, during the battle against Poseidon, Shaina is instrumental in the victory of Athena's army, being sent by Libra Rōshi to bring the Bronze Saints the imprescindible Libra Gold Cloth and going as far as to challenge Poseidon herself, but suffering defeat.

When Phoenix Ikki came back to his senses with the help of his fellow Bronze Saints, the Lizard Saint created a landslide in the hopes of burying them, but he was unsuccessful. Aries Mu created illusions which made the four Black Saints look like the Bronze Saints and teleported them all eight from the landslide. The Silver Saints were deceived by the illusion and went after the Black Saints but Eagle Marin and Misty went after the real Pegasus. Marin, in hopes of saving Seiya, attacked her pupil with an illusion attack and buried him. Misty however didn't fall for it and took the Bronze Saint out of his grave and attacked him. The Silver Saint told Seiya that he had never been bruised in battle and that itself was true victory in Misty's view, never to be hurt by an opponent. During the fight some blood from Seiya fell on Misty, who was disgusted by it cleaned it off. Thus, he removed his Cloth and went into the nearby sea. Seiya deemed him crazy and as soon as Misty donned his Cloth again, the battle continued. After, a hard battle, Pegasus Seiya overcame Misty's attacks and defeated him. :In the adaptation to anime of the Hades arc from the manga, Misty was revived along with his fellow Silver Saints and was sent to fight the Bronze Saints.

Mozes was one of the Silver Saints sent to deal with them, but due to Aries Mu's intervention, he killed the Black Dragon instead. Thinking they completed their mission, they retreated, but returned due to Misty and Babel's delay. Being accompanied by Hound Asterion, who could read minds, Mozes soon turned on Eagle Marin. After subduing her, they tied her upside down to a pole in the sea, to use her as bait for Pegasus Seiya. The plan failed, and Seiya engaged Mozes in combat.

However, due to Aries Mu's intervention, they went after the wrong Saints, ending up killing the Black Saints instead. Believing they had accomplished their mission, they retreated, though Misty stayed behind to confirm his suspicions. After some time, Babel grew worried and returned to find Misty dead on the beach. Cygnus Hyōga soon arrived and challenged the Silver Saint, who was confused because he thought he had already killed the Bronze Saint. Babel regained his composure and fought, confident he had the advantage with his flames, but was ultimately defeated by Hyōga's freezing Cosmo. Of all Silver Saints, Babel is the one who got the closest of defeating Athena's Bronze Saints, but his seemingly unavoidable victory was thwarted by the arrival of the three Steel Saints. :In the anime adaptation, Babel's constellation is spelled rather than \\"Centaurus\\". ; :Voice Actor: Kazuo Hayashi :Due to the Bronze Saints' crime against Sanctuary (participating in the Galaxian Wars), the Pope issued the order that they had to be killed.

As Asterion is one of the few people in the Sanctuary who can use telepathy, he soon discovered that Eagle Marin had betrayed them. After defeating her, he and Mozes used her as bait for Pegasus Seiya by tying her to a pole upside down in the sea. Pegasus Seiya came to them and narrowly managed to defeat Mozes, but was overwhelmed by Asterion's power. In the meantime, Eagle Marin was able to free herself and fought against Asterion. By closing her mind and thinking of nothing, she managed to defeat him, but let him live and return to Sanctuary with a warning to the Pope.
