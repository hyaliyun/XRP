This creates an effect in the fluid where it flows like a liquid, yet behaves like an elastic solid when stretched out. Most elastic fluids exhibit shear thinning (viscosity decreases as shear strain is applied), because they are solutions containing polymers. But Boger fluids are exceptions since they are highly dilute solutions, so dilute that shear thinning caused by the polymers can be ignored. Boger fluids are made primarily by adding a small amount of polymer to a Newtonian fluid with a high viscosity, a typical solution being polyacrylamide mixed with corn syrup. It is a simple compound to synthesize but important to the study of rheology because elastic effects and shear effects can be clearly distinguished in experiments using Boger fluids. Without Boger fluids, it was difficult to determine if a non-Newtonian effect was caused by elasticity, shear thinning, or both; non-Newtonian flow caused by elasticity was rarely identifiable. Since Boger fluids can have constant viscosity, an experiment can be done where the results of the flow rates of a Boger liquid and a Newtonian liquid with the same viscosity can be compared, and the difference in the flow rates would show the change caused by the elasticity of the Boger liquid.James, David F. \\"Boger Fluids.\\" http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.fluid.010908.165125 Retrieved Web. 11 Nov. 2013.

He released his first paper on Boger fluids in 1977, titled \\"A Highly Elastic Constant-Viscosity Fluid\\", where he described the ideal fluid for experimentation as a fluid that is \\"highly viscous and highly elastic at room temperature and at the same time is optically clear\\". The main purpose of the paper was to experiment on the highly viscous and highly elastic fluid and record the fundamental rheometric properties of the fluid. Such a fluid would allow for experimentation under conditions not affected by inertia and shear thinning effects, and influence of inertia would easily be distinguishable.Boger, David V. http://ac.els- cdn.com/0377025777800141/1-s2.0-0377025777800141-main.pdf?_tid=35a90d92-50ba-11e3-ae7d-00000aab0f26&acdnat;=1384824824_7a3fbc26d2b80b3ee3987bb560b67636 Retrieved Web. 13 Nov. 2013. He began his research using maltose syrups (corn syrups) mixed with a small amount of water. He then tested shear stress versus shear rate of the solution to prove that the solution was a Newtonian fluid. This was done by using a R16 Weissenberg rheogoniometer (a rheogoniometer calibrated to measure specifically the behavior of a viscoelastic polymer solution) for the low range shear stress rates, and the high rates were measured using a capillary rheometer, a device used to measure shear stress rates under high stress. The data proved that there was a linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate with the slope being very close to one, meaning the maltose syrup was indeed a Newtonian fluid. Once 0.08% of the polymer polyacrylamide was added, the flow properties drastically changed. Elastic properties were introduced to the fluid while only a slight amount of shear thinning was observed, small enough to be ignored. The syrup solution had properties very similar to a polymer melt, but there was no shear thinning and the materials could be produced at room temperature. = Subsequent Boger fluids = The original Boger fluid was an aqueous solution, as were all the solutions synthesized until 1983, when organic Boger fluids were produced using a dilute solution of polyisobutylene (PIB) in a mixture of polybutene (PB) with a small quantity of kerosene oil added. From then on, most Boger fluids have been PIB - PB solutions. Other recipes include: * polystyrene in ogligomeric glycol (Solomon and Muller 1996) * polyethylene oxide in polyethylene glycol (Dontula et al. 2004) * polystyrene in dioctyl phthalate (Odell & Carrington 2006)  Commercial use  = Waste disposal = The best application so far for Boger fluids is solving the problem of disposal for the waste produced in the processing of bauxite to alumina for use in producing aluminium, and there is normally two or three times more \\"red mud\\" produced than alumina. Normally, the waste, known as \\"red mud\\", was disposed of by being flushed down dams with millions of liters of water. The dams continue to hold the \\"red mud\\", because it does not work as building foundation and also can't be used as farm land. Companies needed to find a way to efficiently dispose of it all onto the dams without clogging the tubes it was being transferred in. With the development of Boger fluids, aluminum giant Alcoa developed a way to convert the waste into a thick matter that could still flow down pipes. Using this method, the dangers of tubes erupting was cut out, leading to a more sustainable practice.Wroe, David. http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/300000-boger- fluid-prize-not-on-the-nose/2005/10/04/1128191716871.html Retrieved Web. 11 Nov. 2013.

The film documents three couples as they go through the various legal processes and cultural barriers as they seek to file for divorce and highlights the poignant differences of men and women in the court system. The film also shows the complexity of blending religious law with a state run court system.  Gender differences  One of the key elements this film documents is the dichotomy between men and women in the eyes of the Iranian court. From the start of the film this becomes clear as the documentary shows the two entrances for men and women as they enter the courthouse. As the men enter they are searched for weapons and cell phones, and as the women enter they are examined to ensure they are dressed according to Islamic standards and guidelines. As the men and women stand before the judge and argue their case the differences between the men and women become even more readily apparent. While the women often plead their cases vigorously, alleging everything from infidelity to domestic abuse, they are almost constantly reminded that divorce is greatly frowned upon by Islam, and if they would try harder at home (i.e. wear makeup around the house, make themselves more attractive, show more respect for their husbands) many of the allegations would resolve themselves. As the documentary progresses, the filmmakers note the differences in legal rights Islamic men and women have when asking for a divorce. In most cases, only men are allowed to seek a divorce unless other circumstances exist such as the man not being able to provide the woman with a child. As more of the rights of men and women are explained the discrepancies become more clear. For instance, should a man seek to divorce his wife he is liable to nothing more other than paying court sanctioned compensation to his wife. However, should the woman seek the divorce she likely will forfeit much if not all of her \\"marriage gift\\" (monetary compensation) and will likely deal with the cultural shame and stigma of being divorced. Furthermore, the film address the issue of child custody and once again highlights the differences between men and women. Should the divorce be finalized and the woman remarries, she automatically forfeits custody of her children and they are returned to her husband. Over and over again, the film seems to show how the law and the court system are established in such a way to favor the rights of men over women.  Blending religious and state law  Beyond highlighting the differences in the rights of men and women in the court, the film also shows the complexities which occur as the Iranian state attempts to blend Sharia law and secular state law. Time and again the Muslim Qadi presiding over the cases will remind those before him of how Islam detests divorce and encourages them to reconcile. Even beyond his religious council, the documentary also shows the Qadi's willingness to impose Islamic punishment such as reminding one man he can receive 70 lashes for referring to his wife as a \\"loose woman\\" in public, but also reminds the wife she must provide four witnesses before such a punishment can be handed down. However, even while it is clear that Islamic law is used and imposed it the film also shows how the Iranian court is willing to combine secular state law as well. This is especially true in terms of the court issuing orders for medical tests to be performed to determine if facts presented in a case are true before rendering a verdict. It also clear that along with the religious elements which are in place, the Iranian court has a well established state run bureaucracy within the court. There are clear procedures in place and a litany of papers which must be filed with the correct departments with the proper signatures included. It is this blending of religious and state law which allows for the judges to have a great deal of leeway in making rulings and issuing mandates to those coming before the court. Often, before issuing any ruling or allowing the divorce to take place, the Qadi attempts to resolve the issue through arbitration and then decides himself if the arbitration was effective and if the couple should be able to reconcile.

Transgender people regularly face transphobic harassment. Ultimately, one of the largest reasons that transgender people face inequality is due to a lack of public understanding of transgender people. Transgender and transgender inequality definitions =Common misconceptions= A common misconception is that a transgender person is therefore gay. However, being transgender focuses on gender identity and not sexual orientation. A transgender person may identify with any sexual orientation. Another important misconception is that individuals who crossdress are transgender. However, many crossdressers are comfortable with their assigned sex. Even though individuals who participate in crossdressing are officially under the Transgender Umbrella, most do not identify as transgender. The status of transgender identity as a mental disorderF 64 of ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders is widely disputed.For example, Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles and an \\"Activist's Guide\\" to the Principles Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria, which is a disconnect between one's assigned sex at birth and the gender which the individual identifies with. Transgender inequality in society Several recent studies - from Trans Equality - have shown that transgender individuals face discrimination within their own family units and schools, in employment and housing, within government settings, through hate crimes, and under the justice and legal systems. From a young age, children are often brought up in heteronormative settings within their own homes and in school. Parents oftentimes respond quite negatively when their children cross gender barriers, prompting transgender youth to run away. As a result, homeless transgender youth are more likely to turn to drug dealing, car theft, and sexual exploitation. According to the Human Rights Campaign, less than 43% of gender- expansive youth said they could turn to an adult in their family if they were worried or sad. In education, transgender individuals also describe discrimination from peers. Transgender youth are three times more likely to be excluded by peers because they are \\"different.\\" A survey of National Center of Transgender Equality states, \\"Those who expressed a transgender identity or gender non-conformity while in grades K-12 reported alarming rates of harassment (78%), physical assault (35%) and sexual violence (12%); harassment was so severe that it led almost one-sixth (15%) to leave a school in K-12 settings or in higher education.\\" Transgender individuals also face discrimination in employment and housing and within government settings. Transgender individuals face double the unemployment, and 90% of those employed face discrimination within their own jobs. The 1994 Employment Non- Discrimination Act does not protect transgender individuals from employment discrimination. Essentially 26% of transgender individuals had lost a job because of their transgender or non-conforming gender status. The NCTE states, \\"Respondents who had lost a job due to bias also experienced ruinous consequences such as four times the rate of homelessness.\\" Transgender individuals are also oftentimes discriminated within government settings through healthcare policies and government-issued IDs. Healthcare policies do not recognize transgender identities as a physical disability. Rather, it is oftentimes characterized as a mental disability, providing transgender individuals with insufficient care: Healthcare policies do not address the pre- and post-operative needs of those individuals who elect to go through sex-change operations. In addition, transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by HIV-AIDS and are more likely to do drugs or alcohol. Although transgender individuals are more at risk health-wise, 19% of the respondents have described being refused medical care and 50% described their medical care was postponed because of their gender status. Transgender individuals also face discrimination when it comes to government-issued IDs. Only one-fifth of the respondents stated that they were able to update all their identification documents. 41% of the respondents live without a driver‚Äôs license that matches their gender identity. Transgender individuals are disproportionately affected by hate crimes, and some could argue the current justice and legal system are not equipped to manage such crimes. Transgender individuals are at risk for hate crime, yet transgender individuals are less likely to report transphobic violence because of their distrust for the police. According to the NCTE, \\"One-fifth (22%) of respondents who have interacted with police, reported harassment by police, with much higher rates reported by people of color.\\" Overall, transgender individuals face discrimination by government agencies. NCTE also reports, \\"One fifth (22%) were denied equal treatment by a government agency or official; 29% reported police harassment or disrespect; and 12% had been denied equal treatment or harassed by judges or court officials.\\" =Timeline= Transgender, while a new term, is not a new phenomenon. In North America, many Native American cultures had identifications for transgender people, being people whose gender identity does not match up with their biological sex. Sabine Lang, in her research, defines non-binary people as women-men and men-women (the first referring to the expression and the second referring to the biological sex), and discusses how different Native American tribes had designations for this and had transgender people integrated and integral to society. From the Navajo to the Shoshoni to the Pueblo de Zuni, there were different definitions and characterizations of what we now know to be transgender people. The Navajo described both men and women who did not identify as their birth sex as being \\"n√°dleeh√©, ‚Äòsomeone who is in a constant process of change,\\" while the Shoshoni entitled it \\"tianna wa‚Äôippi,\\" which is a combination of the word for man and the word for women, which was used interchangeably for both the biologically male and female. For those who were men-women or women-men, it was considered to be a spiritual journey if one was to renounce their born gender and assume the other. According to Lang, unlike in current United States culture, these third-gender designations were not seen as deviant, or strange. Lang further highlights how many tribes considered relationships heterosexual as long as the gender identity lined up as so: in this case, the gender identity was what indicated heterosexual relationships, rather than biological sex. However, in tribes such as the Navajo and Shoshoni, Lang discusses how it would be seen as \\"unthinkable\\" and borderline \\"incestuous,\\" respectively, for two transgender people to be in a sexual relationship. While transgender people in Native American cultures were largely accepted, Lang discusses that when Europeans came over and colonized, they brought with them oppressive ideas on gender non-conformists, and began to influence Native cultures to do the same Some Native American tribes had third gender roles including transgender people. When Europeans came over they deemed them \\"berdaches,\\" a derogatory term for a man trying to pass as a woman, or \\"passing women,\\" a derogatory term for women who tried to assume masculine roles. Transgender people have been facing inequality and discrimination since before the 1800s. Much inequality has stemmed from the terms used to refer to transgender people. Legal measures against non-binary people began to be implemented in the mid-nineteenth century. Laws began to prohibit and make it illegal for anyone to dress in a manner opposed to their biological sex. The current legal institutions that exist today similarly act in a way that discriminates against transgender people, according to Susan Stryker. She illustrates how there exists a lack of accountability to those aggressors who victimize the transgender community, and there is a lack of legal possibility to persecute aggressions against transgender people or to give adequate rights to transgender people. Transgender people, not fitting entirely into the binary of \\"male\\" or \\"female,\\" are not covered by Sex Discrimination laws. Stryker argues that this means that they are largely unprotected when they are attacked in one way or another for being transgender, and it further alienates them from our definition of humanity, making them an \\"other,\\" unrecognized by lawful protections and only seen as outsiders or deviants. The American‚Äôs with Disabilities Act of 1990 does not include transgender as a \\"physical impairment,\\" and excludes them explicitly alongside arsonists and molesters. While there are sometimes state, city, or county laws that protect the transgender community, federal laws largely overlook them. Even though President Obama passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2009, this does not serve to remedy the many issues of the justice system in its unjust treatment transgender people. Judges are still able to exercise personal bias in many rulings that strongly effect transgender people, and it can greatly disenfranchise them within the United States. One thing that has been used by some to gain rights is the designation of transgender as a psychological disorder, known as Gender Identity Disorder. A young girl called Pat Doe, advocating for her own right to wear clothing that matched with her gender identity, was able to gain a favorable outcome in court by using GID to better articulate her argument. While some in the transgender community are critical of labeling themselves as having a psychological disorder, others like Doe have used it to gain what others can‚Äôt otherwise on a legal level. Some continue to say that it is harmful as it continues to \\"other\\" transgenderism, as well as its requirement of \\"significant distress\\". Johnson points out that it excludes those people who are comfortable with their gender identity, and thus does not protect them in legal matters when this otherwise could be used in order to gain legal recognition. This psychological designation also creates a paradox, which would prohibit the steps for remedying this disorder (living as the gender identity of choice, getting hormone treatment, and then surgery). Stephen Whittle wrote the following description in his own work: \\"if you are distressed enough to qualify for surgery, your mental reasoning has been impaired to the point where you probably cannot give informed consent. But if you are not that distressed, you will not be offered the surgery to which you are able to consent\\". The term \\"transvestite\\" originated in 1910 from the German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld. At that time, it was used in a similar fashion to \\"transsexual,\\" a word that was not coined until the late 1940s. The term \\"transgender\\" was first used in 1971. In the past, people have been arrested or forced into insane asylums for being transgender. The first public trials for transvestite behavior involved Ernest Boulton (Stella) and Fred Park (Fanny). Both were arrested in 1870 for indecent behavior, as a result of dressing in clothing of the opposite sex. The first modern sex reassignment surgery was performed by Dr Felix Abraham: a mastectomy on a trans man in 1926. As a result of the laws against cross-dressing, transsexual people sought out doctors who could change their gender to the gender which aligned with their inner identity. The 1950s saw some of the first transgender-positive organizations and publications. These helped transgender people deal with the inequality they faced along with day-to-day issues they encountered. The 1966 case of Anonymous v. Weiner dealt with a transsexual person who had undergone a sex reassignment surgery and wanted to change the name and sex on the birth certificate. The court ruled against allowing a transgender person to change their original sex cited on their birth certificate to match the reassigned gender. It ruled that the only time the sex on a birth certificate could be changed was when an error had been made when recording it at birth. Over the last decade, more than one person per month has died due to transgender-based hate or prejudice. Transgender people who are going through divorce, inheritance battles or custody disputes are vulnerable to legal challenges. This is because the validity of their marriages is often called into question due to inconsistent laws regulating transgender equality. A tremendous inconsistency in the US is that some states recognize a transgender person's gender transition while other states do not. Laws vary from state to state concerning the requirements for changing the gender on birth certificates and other identity documents. Laws also vary concerning whether a state will accept such identity documents as conclusive with respect to one's gender identity. In August 2013, Gov. Jerry Brown passed a bill allowing transgender students in California public schools to participate in sex-segregated programs and use gender separate facilities, such as restrooms, according to their self-perceived gender. =At work= Transgender workers can have a difficult time coping with the traditional workplace due to established gender norms that limit the roles perceived and expected of them. Among fellow employees, potential teasing and/or discrimination can arise further affecting the emotional state of transgender workers. Employers at times retract job offers and opportunities because of discrimination towards workers of varying gender identities. In 2012, former police detective and veteran Mia Macy was denied a ballistics technician position at the federal ATF laboratory because of her transgender identity. After the matter was raised with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it was decided that transgender people are protected from employee and employer discrimination through the Civil Rights Act. The event led her family house to foreclosure, but she was grateful for the final ruling. Furthermore, in law regarding to transgender discrimination in the workplace, the US Senate on 7 November 2013 gave final approval passing legislation actively outlawing private or public sector justification related to promotions, payment and hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This is to recognize a more fair field in the workplace, noting credibility and achievements without being swayed by factors that not only fail to create direct relations to those aspects, but also ones that are vulnerable to prejudice from employees, employers and associates. However despite pay- related legislation being in place in the USA, transgender people are still considerably underpaid as opposed to cis-gendered people. On average transgender people are three times as likely to be unemployed, and even if they are then employed across America transgender people receive less money than the cis-gendered. Transgender people are more than twice as likely to be living in poverty; this perhaps is somewhat due to the often great costs of transitioning from one gender which includes the cost of potential surgery as well as hormone use. The US Selective Service System, as of 2018, refuses to allow or recognize the validity of male to female sex change. Consequently, \\"U.S. citizens or immigrants who are born male and changed their gender to female are still required to register.\\" =In school= Those who identify as transgender at an early age may have troubles when their identity conflicts with judgment from traditional school protocol, whether public or private. Discrimination may come from classmates who tease or physically harm transgender people as a result of transphobia. Because of incidents such as these, the Transgender Day of Remembrance was created to respect and keep in memory gender non-conformists who have been killed through acts of prejudice. This annual event held on 20 November is acknowledged internationally in schools, neighborhoods, and churches. Mental and physical strain through varying forms of assault by their peers is an unfortunate effect on openly transgender students. Even school staff are included in academia-related parties that prefer repressing public displays of transgender action. For example, in November 2013, Jeydon Loredo was temporarily excluded from the La Feria Independent School District yearbook in Texas due to sporting a tuxedo that did not meet \\"community standards.\\" It was not until Loredo, along with his mother, took the case to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that stands for the rights of gay, bisexual and transgender citizens, that the school district reversed its decision, allowing Loredo to wear his tuxedo for the yearly photograph and have it published in their high school yearbook pictures. Those who expressed a transgender identity or gender non-conformity while in grades K-12 reported high rates of harassment (78%), physical assault (35%) and sexual violence (12%); harassment was so severe that it led almost one-sixth (15%) to leave a school in K-12 settings or in higher education. =In college= The needs of college students who identify on the transgender spectrum has been largely explored within the last few years, however this information has been almost entirely limited to four-year colleges and universities. Much of the scrutiny and discrimination that transgender people face in college can be attributed with having to choose what gender binary they are going to publicly identify with within the public eye. One major example of this is deciding what bathroom to use in public. Transgender individuals are faced with deciding whether to use a bathroom that coincides with their gender identity or a bathroom that coincides with the sex they were assigned with at birth. When task/groups are sex-segregated, people must decide what group to choose. Filling out paperwork is also a challenge because even though they feel they are a certain gender, places may consider them to be another gender. One study,Rankin, S., Weber, G. N., Blumenfeld, W. J., & Frazer, S. (2010 ). 2010 state of higher education for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people . Charlotte, NC : Campus Pride followed 34 transgender- spectrum community college students among 164 LGBT students as well as 3,247 college students from other schools. From the pool of 34 transgender-spectrum students, 13 reported experiencing offensive or exclusionary behavior, 19 feared for their physical safety at times because of their sexual identity with 6 fearing for their safety three or more times. Because of these instances 10 students seriously considered leaving their schools and one reported that they were transferring colleges because of the hostile environment. One participant stated he \\"had hell on wheels being a gender variant student in the [community college] system, [as] there are no protections here and issues are dealt with quite poorly\\". Transgender people face inequality when applying to schools. A transgender person applied to Smith College and was rejected because her home state still identified her as male. The application fee was returned with a letter stating, \\"Smith is a women's college, which means that undergraduate applicants to Smith must be female at the time of admission.\\" In 2013, the University of North Carolina school system voted to ban any gender-neutral housing at its campuses. A February 2014 Washington Post article noted that nearly 150 US schools have gender-neutral housing programs. Colleges can implement a number of different techniques and solutions in order to make their community more welcoming to the transgender community. Campus events and activities are a major component of making any college student feel involved and connected with their community and fellow students. The more a student is involved with campus and community events, the better a student fares not only socially, but also academically. Colleges can increase campus awareness by hosting transgender awareness events which can help by making transgender students feel understood as well as to educate the general student population on transgender issues. Support services formed by LGBT communities oftentimes do not properly cater towards transgender-specific issues and thus transgender people will often come together on campuses to create their own support group. Campus housing also presents itself with a predicament as most colleges will assign either male or female or \\"coed\\" housing to first and second year students. Transgender students are most commonly assigned to housing on a case-by-case basis. Colleges like the University of Minnesota and Twin Cities have developed policies which promise to find comfortable housing to any known transgender students. Many colleges are changing student intake forms to account for other genders other than male or female. \\"Some of the most dangerous places on many campuses for transgender students are restrooms and locker rooms designated for \\"women\\" and \\"men.\\" Anecdotal and research evidence suggest that transgender people often face verbal and physical assault and risk being questioned or even arrested by the police when they use gender-specific facilities (Coalition for Queer Action, 2001; San Francisco Human Rights Commission, 2001).\\" \\"Whether through cross-dressing, transitioning from one gender to another, or blending in traditionally female and male elements, transgender students violate society‚Äôs expectation that someone is either female or male, which makes them vulnerable to harassment and violence\\"Astin, Alexander W. \\"Student Involvement: A Developmental Theory for Higher Education.\\" (1984): n. pag. Web. 17 Apr. 2017. Transgender inequality for people of color Many believe that transgender individuals of color face additional financial, social, and interpersonal challenges as a result of structural racism in comparison to the transgender community as a whole, however many cite a lack of evidence to this belief. According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, the combination of anti-transgender bias with structural and individual racism means that transgender people of color experience particularly high levels of discrimination. Specifically, black transgender people reported the highest level of discrimination among all transgender individuals of color. Studies on the transgender community are extremely rare, and even fewer studies have been conducted on the experiences of transgender individuals of color. However, some literature has documented the experiences of certain minority groups and the unique challenges they face in everyday life. The majority of the discussion in this section is based on findings from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, due to the extreme rarity of data available on this subject. =Theories= Studies of the experiences of transgender people of color are often based on the theories of intersectionality and privilege. Intersectional approaches argue that the overlapping racial and gender identities of transgender people of color results in them experiencing even more oppression and discrimination. Therefore, transgender advocacy should give special attention to non-white individuals. In this context, the theory of privilege asserts that both white transgender individuals and cisgender people of color receive certain benefits because of their skin color or gender identity, while those who are both non- white and non-heterosexual are deprived of these benefits and face additional oppression. For example, according to a report by National LGBTQ Task Force, Asian transgender individuals were more likely than their cisgender counterparts to report experiencing racism within the LGBT community. This aligns with matrix of domination theory, which argues that sociological factors such as race and gender overlap and increase the degree of discrimination experienced by minority individuals. Addressing the overlapping racial and gender discrimination facing transgender individuals of color has raised a lot of debate both among scholars and the public. One advocated approach is to work within the existing binary sex classification system and grant legal rights to transgender individuals based on their self-defined gender identity. Another approach argues that transgender people would be better served if the existing binary sex classifications were dismantled. Similarly, race scholars disagree about whether embracing existing race classifications helps or harms minorities. Much of the disagreement lies in the question of how racial and gender identities are formed. The essentialism, or nature, views states that these identities are fixed and inherent from birth, while the social constructionism, or nurture, views sees them as flexible and dependent on one‚Äôs environment. =Inequality in employment and socioeconomic status= Some transgender people face disadvantages in the workplace, although black transgender people are among the most disadvantaged. 32% of black transgender individuals report losing their job due to bias, compared to 26% of Latino transgender people, 24% of white transgender people and 21% of Asian-Pacific American transgender people. In addition, the unemployment rate for transgender individuals of minority races is especially high, with blacks, American Indians, and Latinos experiencing four times higher the unemployment rate of the general population. Such individuals are also more likely to live in poverty, with 34% of blacks and 28% of Latinos living on less than $10,000 dollars a year. =Inequality in health= Transgender people also risk discrimination, harassment, and victimization in health care settings. More than a fourth of transgender people have encountered segregation by a doctor or have been denied enlistment in a medical coverage because of their gender identity. Different studies found that they are less likely than the overall public to have medical coverage, and for those with protection, numerous transgender-related health needs are not protected. In a study done in Chicago, 14% reported difficulty getting emergency health care because they were transgender. A San Francisco investigation of 515 transgender individuals found that 62% had experienced segregation in business, lodging, or health services. The research done represents one of the first major attempts to understand the behavior of transgender adults in many different areas but focusing mainly on their health and any risks that can be identified to their immediate health and access to health services. The best way to develop and integrate important interventions for this group, it is vital to not just address the common health risks seen by the older population in general but also focus on issues related to transgender people specifically such as fear to seek health services, victimization and internal stigmas. As more and more studies take place the understanding of transgender inequality relating to health and medical issues starts to take hold. In one study, nearly 42% of transgender adults reported harassment of both verbal and physical variety as well as denial of fair and equal treatment at a doctor‚Äôs office or hospital. Though there are not many studies out there that focus on transgender health care, the ones that are happening show a lot of discrimination and unfair treatment in hospitals as well as doctors‚Äô offices. Focusing on community outreach in diverse communities is important to help rid health related inequality among the older population. Transgender individuals of color encounter more physical and mental health issues than transgender whites and their heterosexual counterparts. The HIV infection rate for transgender individuals overall is 2.6%, two percent over the national average. Within this group, 25% of blacks, 11% of Latinos, and 7% of American Indians report being HIV positive. A 2007 analysis of Medicaid policies found that exclusions on transition-related health expenses, such as hormone therapy and sex change surgeries, have a disproportionately large effect on low-income transgender people of color, leading to increased violence, political disenfranchisement, and poor health outcomes. In addition, due to the rampant institutional and interpersonal discriminatory practices against transgender individuals of color, they often suffer mental health consequences from social and economic inequalities. Because transgender people of color face double discrimination for their racial and gender identities, they are more likely to be denied jobs and fall into poverty, leaving them to careers of prostitution or other illegal dealings. These structural issues can often lead to increased encounters with the criminal justice system as well as emotional difficulties. Suicidal ideation is especially common among transgender people who belong to racial minorities: 49% of blacks and 47% of Latinos report attempting suicide, compared to 41% of transgender individuals of all races. =Violence and the criminal justice system= A 2013 report by the National Coalition of Anti- Violence Programs found that members of racial minority groups who also identified as transgender were more likely to experience harassment and hate- motivated violence. Specifically, transgender people of color were 1.5 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation, and 1.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault, than white cisgender individuals. They were also 6 more times more likely to face police violence. In a study that cross analyzed reports of sexual assault and violence against transgender people, Rebecca Stotzer found that these attacks are believed to start as early as age 12, and one study found that the median age for first rapes of transgender individuals of color occurred at age 14 and 15. In fact, one of the studies that Stotzer quoted, conducted by Shannon Wyss, found that transgender high school students had to deal with \\"full-contact hallways\\", which respondents in the study described as places where they were pushed, kicked, hit, and even held down and beat up by a group of people. Stotzer's cross analysis covered 1,896 respondents from across the country and found that acts of violence happen across a lifetime for transgender individuals, with multiple acts of violence or intolerance happening on a daily basis. In contrast to white transgender hate crime victims, transgender victims from racial minorities are more likely to identify their race as contributing to the assault, and many perceived violence to stem from negatively representing their racial communities. Transgender people and unequal treatment in the LGBT community Beginning in the 1990s, lesbian and gay activist organizations added transgender people to their cause because at that time transgender people faced many of the same prejudices. During this time the gay and lesbian community frequently referred to their organizations as defending the interests of and \\"serving the needs of all gay Americans\\". Due to this description many Americans associated the term transgender with being gay. Some members of the LGBT community are uncomfortable with transgender individuals and their issues. In Kristen Schilt's Just One of the Guys: Transgender Men and the Persistence of Gender Inequality?, she interviews transgender men who have encountered tokenism while working in LGBT organizations. In other words, because LGBT communities include the \\"T\\", they need a transgender representative as part of the organization. Schilt says that many transgender people encountered being the only one responsible for knowing anything about being transgender. When anyone within the LGBT organizations had questions about transgender issues they were always referred to the token transgender representative. The unequal treatment of transgender individuals may be because not all transgender individuals are gay. Schilt also concluded that some gay transgender people were treated poorly by cisgender gay individuals because they were thought to have made the choice to be gay. Therefore, the gay community's display of transphobia and heterosexism creates inequality.GL vs. BT Jillian Todd Weiss Journal of Bisexuality Vol. 3, Iss. 3-4, 2003 According to Tyler Curry, the senior editor of HIV Equal Online and an award-winning LGBT columnist, \\"As we continue to progress in the fight for equal rights, it has become apparent that the \\"T\\" in LGBT is being neglected as gay men and women continue to take precedence. By being part of the same-sex acronym, trans individuals are rarely recognized as a unique group that requires its own specific agenda to obtain equality. Instead, they are often considered an obscure and misunderstood subgroup of the gay community.\\" Many individuals in the LBG community do not identity with transgender people, and believe that gay rights and transgender rights should be separated. This view stems from many reasons, including the difference between sexual identity and gender identity, and whether each is considered a \\"choice\\" or not.Curry, Tyler. \\"Why Gay Rights and Trans Rights Should Be Separated\\". Huffingtonpost.com. 2 February 2016. Retrieved 18 April 2017. Gay rights advocate John Aravosis said, \\"But when [the gay community is] asked‚Äîwell, told‚Äîto put our civil rights on hold, possibly for the next two decades, until America catches up on its support for trans rights, a lot of gay people don't feel sufficiently vested in trans rights, sufficiently vested in the T being affixed to the LGB, to agree to such a huge sacrifice for people they barely know.\\" Transgender people's legal rights in the United States There is currently no federal law banning transgender discrimination against someone trying to change their name due to their gender identity. Changing the birth certificate requires either proof of surgical treatment or a court order in favor of the change (depending on the state), but still in some states this right will not be granted. A person can also change their gender marker on their Social Security card, and this does not require proof of surgical treatment. Sex between members of the same gender has been legal nationwide in the United States since 2003 (Lawrence v. Texas), and marriage is currently recognized by the federal government. The United States has allowed gay people to serve openly in the military since 2011, though the status of openly transgender members has been in limbo since 2018. While currently there is no federal anti-discrimination laws for LGBT people, there are in 21 states and there is currently a bill passed in the US Senate that may provide protection on a federal level. The Matthew Shepard Act it expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime laws to include crimes motivated by a victim‚Äôs actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), a bill that would make discriminating against LGBT people in the workplace illegal, passed in the US Senate on 7 November 2013. This was the first time in history where a transgender employment non-discrimination bill passed in the Senate. Also note that this bill was passed with a bipartisan majority. In 2017, the Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, reversed the Obama-era policy which used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect transgender employees from discrimination. Bostock v. Clayton County, , was a landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled (on 15 June 2020) that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination because of their gender identity (or sexual orientation).Bostock v. Clayton County, .Supreme Court Ruling 2020-06-15 (pages 1 ‚Äì 33 in the linked document) A plaintiff in the case was Aimee Stephens, an openly transgender woman.

Since their discovery in ill-documented circumstances in the 1920s and their subsequent purchase by the British Museum,British Museum Collection database they have been described as \\"great masterpieces\\" that \\"combine most of the key features of early Celtic Art\\".Megaws, 76 They are in many respects very similar to the D√ºrrnberg Flagon found in Austria. Description The almost identical pair of flagons imitate the shape of contemporary Etruscan flagons and are made of a copper alloy that was skilfully beaten into shape from a single sheet of metal. The base was cast to size and decorated with 120 pieces of red coral and glass and then attached using resin. Resin is also used to coat the inside, which makes the flagon watertight. The cast spout and lid is attached using pins into a cutout made in the copper sheet body. X-rays reveal that the resin and the pins were the only materials used by the artisans to assemble these artefacts; although there is some evidence of solder that dates from the 20th century. The bases were apparently left open until the end of construction and the flagons were only water-tight because of a coating of resin over the whole inside of the vessel. They had evidently been well-used, and the chains currently attaching the stoppers on the lids are later additions that had been made to replace earlier fittings.Megaws, 78-79 Detail of the lid of one of the flagons The flagons are richly decorated with glass and coral inlays and a range of animals on the lid. Time has faded the coral but the pieces would have been brightly coloured. The handle is formed as a dog, terminating at the bottom with a human face. The idea of a dog or other animal for a handle comes from Greek and Etruscan culture, as does the motif of two crouching animals lying around the rim, as well as the head at the bottom of the handle. The duck on the spout is a Celtic addition to the scheme. The eyes of the duck and the dogs have been finished by using a complex drill bit and they were drilled by the same person. Both vessels measure just over 40 cm in height. The drinking vessels were found with a pair of Etruscan bronze stamnoi or vessels for wine-mixing that date from the same period (also now in the British Museum).BM collection database; Megaws, 76; Green, 60-62 Similar decoration from the lid of the D√ºrnberg flagon Other comparable Celtic adaptions of the classical flagon shape have survived. Among them, a late 5th-century example from a chariot-burial at D√ºrrnberg (now Keltenmuseum in Hallein, Austria) has similar animals to the three dogs, and human heads at the bottom of the handle as well as on the lid. Here the whole body is decorated with raised vertical ribs with an elegant abstracted design suggesting plant-forms at top and bottom. The flagon only uses bronze.Green, 22-23; Megaws, 76-80 Other examples are from Kleinaspergle, Hohenasperg, near Stuttgart, and Borsch.Megaws, 76; Green, 60-62 Circumstances of the find The two flagons and two stamnoi were apparently found in 1927 during the course of railway construction in the town of Basse Yutz, Moselle, eastern France. The excavators had probably discovered the grave of an important Celtic dignitary from the local Iron Age. Unfortunately, little is known of the local circumstances of their discovery, as the grave was dug illicitly without the help of trained archeologists.; Megaws, 76 Within two years of the discovery, all four objects were sold to the British Museum. They were bought for ¬£5,000 which was a substantial sum, especially as many thought they were too sophisticated to be genuine. Artistic importance The Basse Yutz flagons represent one of the high points of La T√®ne Celtic art. Very few other objects from that era can compare in terms of aesthetic quality and elegance. The two flagons were featured in the BBC Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects in 2010, where the flagons were put in context. At the time of their manufacture there were no cities in non-Mediterranean Europe, but there were small communities with skilful metal-working facilities. The flagons show also that these communities had trading links with more distant areas of Europe: shapes in the designs of palm leaves indicate cultural links to Egypt, and tin in the alloy would probably have come from Cornwall in England. The basic idea of a flagon in this shape comes from Italy, but these artefacts show that the people we know as \\"the Celts\\", although illiterate, had a complex and sophisticated culture of their own.

It was published in December 2012 by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress. The plan was written by a community of specialists, but is prominently credited to Brenda Nelson-Strauss, Alan Gevinson and Sam Brylawski The cover page of the National Recording Preservation Plan Background In 2000, Congress passed the \\"National Recording Preservation Act\\", which established the National Recording Preservation Foundation and the National Recording Preservation Board. In 2010, this board published a document titled \\"The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States\\", which identified legal and technical factors that contribute to the loss of sound recordings. The National Recording Preservation Plan can be considered a response to the challenges identified in this study. Content After a foreword by the Librarian of Congress and an executive summary, the plan is divided into four major sections: Building the National Sound Recording Preservation infrastructure, Blueprint for implementing preservation strategies, Promoting broad public access for educational purposes and Long-term national strategies. = Building the National Sound Recording Preservation infrastructure= This section calls for increased infrastructure to support audio preservation, including more and better storage facilities, education programs, a directory of resources, and a formal agenda for further research. Physical and digital infrastructure Sound recordings on physical media require specific conditions to slow the inevitable degradation of the carriers. Facilities that can accomplish these conditions are expensive to create and maintain, so the plan recommends fundraising for the creation of such facilities and consortial funding and use between smaller institutions. The need for professional preservation reformatting (digitization) facilities is similar, and the plan suggests similar strategies for increased reformatting in the following section - increased in-house services where feasible, collaboration where necessary, and, possibly, expansion of the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center to allow nonprofit third parties to use their facilities or their services. Best practices for the archival storage of digital information call for sophisticated networks of storage and curation to ensure the data persist and remain accessible. Few archives currently meet these standards, and there is little research toward the specific needs of audio data. In this section, the plan challenges readers to devise innovative strategies to create and share repositories, and to continue to improve digital storage through research. Education and professional training Audio preservation is not a new discipline, but has traditionally been carried out by personnel with various disparate professional backgrounds. Audio engineers, archivists and librarians, computer scientists, and subject specialists in music, history and folklore (to name a few) have all made important contributions to the practice and literature. There has not, however, traditionally been uniform training in audio preservation. This part of the plan calls for the development of professional educational programs in audio preservation that balance the knowledge of the fields above and would prepare individuals to perform, or at least understand, the many skills required to accomplish this work. This education will require the identification of and participation by those institutions with the requisite human and technical resources, or the development of these faculties at interested institutions. With these programs in place, funding and internships and fellowships will further allow prospective students to seamlessly enter the field. In addition to primary education in audio preservation, the next sections call for continuing education for working professionals, and a resource directory that compiles information about educational programs, working professionals and organizations, best practices, general literature, funding institutions, and more. This document, called the Audio Preservation Resource Directory, is frequently referred to throughout the remainder of the plan. National technology research agenda Much research has been done on the attributes and failures of sound media, and best practices in archival transfer, but much more research, such as new methods of transfer, new treatments to deteriorating audio carriers, and new methods of digital storage, is expected to yield promising results in the near future. This research will require collaboration between government, academia and industry in order to leverage existing competencies and avoid duplication of effort. Much of the information about legacy equipment and skills is held only by senior archivists and engineers who will eventually retire. Recommendation 1.8 suggests readers practice 'knowledge management' by conducting video interviews with senior staff. Any other information held in schematics or equipment manuals should be similarly documented and archived. =Blueprint for implementing preservation strategies= This section emphasizes the need for a consensus of best practices in the variety of tasks that constitute the audio preservation practice, as well as the need for tools and guidelines for the management of digital audio. Audio preservation management Acknowledging the imminence of many audio preservation projects, the insufficiency of funding for this type of work, and the lack of formally trained professionals in many smaller institutions, recommendation 2.1 calls for the development of a handbook that presents best practices in audio preservation in simple, practical terms. Such a guide would act as an approachable lesson in best practices for personal collectors or smaller institutions. The next recommendation demonstrates the need for assessment of collections in prioritizing work and generating funding. Assessment can be performed by third-party consultants, or by existing staff with the help of assessment tools, some of which exist, and some that still need to be developed. Somewhat in alignment with the handbook described above, recommendation 2.3 encourages partnerships between institutions of different types (private vs. public), sizes, finances and goals (etc.). An example of this might be a non-profit community radio station working with a university to store or transfer an important collection of radio program transcriptions that the station would not be able to handle on its own.  New tools and guidelines for preserving digital audio files Although digital audio is often perceived as the 'destination' of audio preservation activity, it is more accurately a halfway point. Digital transfers of legacy audio and born-digital audio must be actively maintained to ensure continued preservation and accessibility. Some foresight in the production of digital audio can facilitate these goals moving forward. Recommendation 2.4 encourages successful institutions to share the tools and strategies that allowed them to create useful digital audio objects. While these will certainly vary project to project and institution to institution, some strategies may be widely or universally better than others, and these should be identified and communicated. One of the universally beneficial features of digital audio is metadata. While specific schema will vary widely, all digital audio should include technical metadata about the production of the audio, descriptive metadata about the content of the audio, and structural metadata about the relationships between audio files and related objects. Standardization of these metadata schemas encourages interoperability between organizations and facilitates access and future data curation and migration. One of the best ways to ensure interoperability, in metadata and beyond, is to use and promote software and tools that adhere to established standards. Some commercial software and tools are built with this functionality, and some can be modified or extended to permit it. Open source software is sometimes more flexible than commercial. This recommendation may seem to apply only to software engineers, but managers and archivists must be aware of these considerations and choose tools with them in mind. Not all digital audio is transferred from analog carriers. In recent years, digital recording has mostly replaced analog technologies, and some digital audio is produced entirely in the digital realm (electronic music, MIDI, etc.). These files are often considered to be at equal risk to those on deteriorating analog media because of the lack of standardization, and obsolescence of proprietary software used to produce the recordings. Awareness of these issues among archives and promotion of awareness among musicians and producers may help identify which formats will require attention, and prompt research into emulating legacy software or migrating proprietary data. =Promoting broad public access for educational purposes= This section begins to address the ways in which preservation is interdependent with access. Complicated intellectual property laws prevent audio archives from making most recordings publicly available, and funding agencies are reluctant to fund initiatives that don't improve access to materials. The following recommendations seek to improve public access to information that can be legally distributed, advocate for copyright reform, and streamline legal avenues for access to copyrighted works for educational use. Discovery and cataloging initiatives Widespread public access to recordings is an admirable goal for archives, but is unrealistic in most cases considering current copyright policy. There are many ways that archives can improve access to their collections, however, without risking legal action or offense to rights holders. Recommendation 3.1 suggests the development and consolidation of discographies into a comprehensive national discography that would simplify the tracking of rights ownership. Although many decades of research have produced satisfactory discographies of individual record labels and musical forms, consolidation could improve usefulness through standardization, community annotation, and interoperability with existing collection catalogs and finding aids. Inclusion of commercially published discographies will be licensed with their respective publishers. If a consolidated discography would bring together all published recordings into a single resource, a national directory of existing sound collections might compile information about existing collections at a fraction of the time, expense and effort of the discography. Audio holdings in existing collections, and even entire audio collections can be completely invisible to scholars without representation or community involvement. Recommendation 3.2 requests a directory of existing collections of all types, contact information for representatives, and descriptions of subject or format strengths. This directory may help facilitate partnerships as described in recommendation 2.3. Just as standardized metadata helps people discover digital audio objects (recommendation 2.5), cataloging libraries' and archives' holdings of physical audio objects (and related materials) helps their respective constituents discover their materials better. Copy (shared) cataloging between institutions requires a consensus on what information must be included in a catalog record. This discussion should be undertaken publicly, and the results shared and distributed as best practices. Copyright legislation reform \\"Copyright reform...remains the key solution to preserving America's recorded sound history, protecting ownership rights, and providing public access\\" American copyright laws about sound recordings are uniquely restrictive compared to American copyright laws for other formats and international copyright laws about sound recordings. In addition to preventing access, existing laws sometimes prohibit the preservation of deteriorating carrier objects until the object has audibly degraded. Recommendation 3.4 recognizes the need for federal copyright coverage of sound recordings committed before February 1972. The federal copyright code does not address sound recordings made before 15 Feb. 1972, which means that the legal status of their use and reproduction is in \\"limbo\\" - decided by a complex network of state laws and court decisions. Federalization of copyright for these recordings would clarify their status, and potentially initiate conversations about reformatting and academic use. The recommendation also suggests that copyright protection for recordings require reasonable market availability. If the copyright owner of a recording cannot be identified or located, recommendation 3.5 suggests that it be considered an 'orphan work', reducing the liability of institutions who choose to distribute it in good faith after a reasonable search. This recommendation works in tandem with 3.4 in that federalization of sound recording copyrights would allow the 'orphan work' designation to apply uniformly to such recordings without being subject to contradictory state laws and court decisions. Section 108 of the US copyright code allows the preservation reformatting of deteriorating sound recordings under specific conditions. The study group appointed by the Library of Congress and US Copyright Office to evaluate the section concluded that these conditions are outdated and overly restrictive, and recommendation 3.6 of this plan suggests ways to modernize the code to allow for better preservation and access in the academic realm. These recommendations include: * Expand eligibility to pre-1972 recordings. * Expand eligibility of protection beyond libraries and archives to include other nonprofit organizations and vendors working on behalf of nonprofits. * Allow more than three copies (as appropriate), and allow reformatting before recording has already perceptibly deteriorated. * Expand a library's right to distribute reproductions of sound recordings beyond news content at a user's request, provided it is not reasonably commercially available. * Expand the definition of 'adjunct works', as described in subsection 108(i) to allow them to deliver related content along with requested audio. * Allow virtual (i.e. streaming) access copies to be made available, instead of requiring that a researched physically visit the library or archive. * Increase the term of access to commercially unavailable works that remain under copy protection to the last 45 years of their term if they were produced before 1961, where previously subsection 108(h) allowed this availability in the last 20 years. Improving legal public access This section addresses the ways in which innovative licensing agreements can expand scholarly access to copyrighted recordings. Recommendation 3.7 encourages archives to work with rights holders to license rare out-of-print recordings for streaming on the web. This would allow archives to share their holdings without risking a lawsuit, and record labels to monetize their properties without the cost and effort of producing a formal reissue. Recommendation 3.8 theorizes a shared network of digital audio files representing transfers of commercial recordings. Similar to copy cataloging, this model would allow archives to share the effort of digitizing collections. A similar model for paper holdings has been successful in recent years. The next recommendation suggests the need for a shared database of label ownership information. This would clarify whether a recording could be considered an orphan work (and therefore shareable), and would avoid a situation described in recommendation 3.7 whereby archives self-impose restrictions on access to avoid infringing on rights holders' interests. Recommendation 3.10 challenges the Library of Congress, the United States' largest collection of sound recordings, to find new ways to make their immense collection more accessible. One proposed solution involves building additional research centers to allow for in-person listening without sometimes prohibitive travel to the Library of Congress. The final recommendation of this section challenges institutions interested in sharing audio holdings to work with representatives of rights holders to build a consensus on the application of the fair use doctrine, and to publish a guide of best practices based on their findings. =Long-term national strategies= This final section reflects on the recommendations of the previous three, and addresses the larger practical challenges in accomplishing these goals. The first recommendation of this section, 4.1, charges the National Recording Preservation Board with the task of coordinating the activities recommended by this document. These activities include aiding preservation work by other institutions, promoting public understanding of the board and foundation's goals, developing fundraising campaigns, and forming committees to report on the more specialized tasks. The next recommendation charges the board with the creation of an advisory committee composed of heads of archives and recording industry executives to work together to accomplish the goals of the plan and resolve conflicts between affected parties. Recommendation 4.3 requests the development of a national collections policy, and suggests a few formats and genres to be considered, including local radio programs, recordings published only in digital form, recordings published by small independent record labels, neglected and emerging formats, and corporate records on the production of sound recordings. The next recommendation addresses recordings whose licensing agreements could interfere with their archiving. This includes recordings that are only available to stream, or downloads that are licensed for personal use only. Suggestions for improvement are educational clauses in existing license to allow formal archiving or coordinating with publishers to write separate licenses for archiving. Recommendation 4.5 recognizes that the goals prescribed by the plan are expensive to undertake, and that current funding is inadequate. The authors go on to suggest several ways in which funding could be expanded, including partnerships with music industry stakeholders, online audio sales merchants or recording artists and new campaigns to make audio preservation more visible to traditional funding agencies, The final recommendation of the plan, 4.6, calls for the periodic assessment of the progress made by the board, the foundation, and the greater community of audio preservation professionals through a conference or meetings.

Early life He was the only son of Samuel Lee, haberdasher of small wares in Fish Street Hill, London. He was educated at St. Paul's School, London under Alexander Gill. Academic and minister Lee entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1647, and was created M.A. by the parliamentary visitors on 14 April 1648. He was elected fellow of Wadham College on 3 October 1648, was recommended for a fellowship at Merton in 1649, and was appointed to one at All Souls in 1650, but nevertheless remained at Wadham. He was elected proctor for 1651, objection on the ground of insufficient standing being overruled by the parliamentary visitors, and he was admitted 9 April 1651. He was bursar of his college in 1648, 1650, and 1664, sub-warden in 1652, and dean in 1653. From about 1650 he was a preacher in and near Oxford, although he had not received orders from a bishop. After preaching in London he was, in 1654, recalled to his duties at Wadham by the visitors of that year. He gave up his rooms on 13 June 1656, and vacated his fellowship in 1657. In July 1655 Lee was made minister of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate, by Oliver Cromwell. He occupied the church till August 1659, when he was removed by a committee of the Rump parliament. Towards the end of the Protectorate he was also lecturer of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate. After 1660 After the Restoration Lee became a member of John Owen's congregation in Leadenhall Street, though John Wilkins, his former tutor, vainly urged him to conform. He preached in London churches, and sometimes resided on an estate he possessed at Bignal, near Bicester in Oxfordshire. On the death of John Rowe (12 October 1677) he became joint pastor with Theophilus Gale of Howe's congregation in Baker's Court, Holborn. The following year, on Gale's death, he removed to Newington Green, where he was minister of an independent congregation till 1686. Last years Lee migrated to New England in 1686, and on the formation of a church at Bristol, Rhode Island was chosen minister on 8 May 1687. After the Glorious Revolution he decided to return to England. He sailed from Boston 2 October 1691. His ship was seized by a French privateer and taken to St. Malo. His wife and daughter were separated from him and, unknown to him, were sent to England. He died at St. Malo of a fever about Christmas 1691, and was buried outside the town. Lee inclined more to independency than to presbyterianism, but was not rigid. Works Lee was a noted scholar, and studied astrology, but then destroyed the books and manuscripts that he had collected. on the subject. He continued the Theatrum Historicum of Helvicus from 1629 (Oxford edition, 1651).

Biography  =Palestine= Salama was born in the village Qula in 1913 during the Ottoman rule over Palestine. He was one of the leaders of armed Arab groups who fought against British authorities and the Yishuv. He participated in the violent 1933 Jaffa demonstrations during the 1933 Palestine riots, and became a leader of the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine. Salama with rifle in hand and on horseback during the revolt in Mandatory Palestine, 1939 At the beginning of the Revolt in early May 1936 he was assigned to command the Lydda - al-Ramla - Jaffa area. He planned and led a number of successful operations against the British mandatory forces and the Yishuv. These operations included blowing up railway tracks and electrical power poles, severing lines of communication, and burning Yishuv orchards. In 1938 Salama was wounded when he blew up a train on the Lydda-Haifa line. Salama fought under nom de guerre Abu Ali. = Kingdom of Iraq= After the Arab revolt collapsed in Palestine and the breaking of World War II, in October 1939, Salama fled via Beirut and Damascus to Baghdad, together with the mufti of Jerusalem Hajj Amin al-Husseini, Arab High Committee members Jamal al-Husayni, Rafiq al-Tamimi and the revolt military leaders Fawzi al-Qawuqji and Arif Abd al-Razzaq. When he was in Damascus, Syria in 1939, according to British records, Salama \\"approached indirectly\\" the British whom he had been fighting and offered his services to round up his past comprades, but the British declined his offer.State of Israel's blog, June 3, 2015: http://israelsdocuments.blogspot.co.il/2015/06/british-reports-on-hassan- salameh-arab.html In Iraq Salama had graduated the Military College at Baghdad together with other Army of the Holy War commanders including Abd al-Qadir al- Husayni and 'Abd-al-Rahim Mahmud. The military training was possible due to the special relationship between the mufti and the Iraqi government. Salama supported Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and led a group of 165 Palestinian fighters. He participated in the Rashid Ali coup of 1941 and the subsequent Anglo-Iraqi War. =World War II & Operation Atlas= 1945 reward poster Salama followed the grand mufti al-Husseini to Nazi Germany and became his senior aid and a virtual covert operative of the Germans.\\" Salama fled to Berlin from Iraq as a member of the mufti's entourage which included also Fawzi al-Qawuqji. The mufti and his aids were put on payroll by nazis and were provided with office and living space for the duration of the war. Salama took a German wife and went through commando and sabotage training, and served a member of a special commando unit of the German foreign intelligence organization Amt VI. He participated in Operation ATLAS: on the night of October 6, 1944 Salama and four other commandos (three German Templars and one Palestinian Arab) parachuted from a German Heinkel HeS 3 into mandatory Palestine over Wadi Qelt. Their equipment reportedly included explosives, submachine guns, dynamite, radio equipment and 5,000 Pound sterling. They had some poison capsules intended to liquidate locals believed to be collaborating with the mandatory authoritiesChristian Destremau, Le Moyen-Orient pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, Perrin, 2011. One of the Germans and Salama evaded capture, and he took refuge in Qula, where a physician treated his injured foot.Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine by Klaus- Michael Mallmann and Martin Cuppers, tran. by Krista Smith, (Enigma Books, published in association with the United States Holocaust Museum, NY; 2010), pp. 200, 201 The operation was intended to supply local Palestinian Arab resistance groups with resources and arms, and to direct sabotage activity primarily at Jewish (rather than British) targets.The National Archives  The Catalogue  Full Details  KV 2/401 \\"...The object of the 'Commando', jointly operated by German Intelligence and their protege, the Berlin-based Mufti of Jerusalem, was, through contact with local Palestinians and the supply of cash and arms, to organise local resistance activity, including sabotage. This was to be directed against Jewish rather than British targets....\\" =1947‚Äì1948 Palestine War= North face (breached by sappers) of HQ building of Hasan Salama in 2015 In 1947 Salameh re-emerged as second-in-command of the Army of the Holy War, a force of Palestinian irregulars in the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War associated with Grand Mufti al-Husseini. The force has been described as Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's \\"personal\\" army. Salama had retrieved Nazi arms that had been hidden in the Egyptian desert during WWII, and on December 8, 1947 used them to attack Tel Aviv's Hatikva Quarter. Haganah had prior information and were expecting the attack. After three-hour battle Palestinians retreated, Salama lost about one hundred men killed. The mufti assigned Salama to the Lydda district, the appointment acknowledged by the Military Committee of the Arab league , however after Jaffa's commander Al-Hawwari, who was appointed at December 1947, had openly met with Haganah intelligence service officers to discuss cease-fire, Al-Hawwari was abolished from Jaffa. At January 22, Salama had arrived at Jaffa commanding forty Bosnian Yugoslavian troops, who were experienced soldiers familiar with preparing, using explosives and building fortifications, probably veterans of the Muslim division of Waffen SS recruited by the mufti for nazis. Salama remained in Jaffa for ten days. Salama was partially successful in organizing militia of five hundred men from the armed groups active in Jaffa, though some joined \\"only nominally\\". At a meeting held in Damascus on 5 February 1948 , Salama was removed from Jaffa by the Military Committee of the Arab league and his assignment to the Lydda district was reconfirmed. As a regional commander Salame organised activity along the roads in his region along Al-Ramla - Jaffa road. About five hundred Bosnian volunteers joined Salama and Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni ranks. Salama may have known Bosnian Waffen S. S. 13th Hand≈æar (‚ÄôKnife‚Äô) veterans who joined from his training in Germany during World War II. Foreign volunteers were important part of Salama force, since local Arabs avoided taking part in fighting. For instance, Salama had to use foreign volunteers to carry out an attack he planned on Jewish transport to Rishon Letzion, since Bayt Dajan residents refused to help him. During March 1948 Haganah intelligence had learned that Salama together with Iraqi commander of Al-Ramla established command headquarters in a four storey building near al-Ramla. On April 5, Givati Brigade's company infiltrated and destroyed the compound, 25 Arabs were killed. Salama was not harmed, however his escape was deemed \\"disgraceful\\". However Salama returned to the destroyed building, retrieved the equipment and established his new command headquarters at Yehudia village. There are reports that Salama used ex-Nazi advisors in his fight in Palestine. Salama was a member of the Palestine Arab Party. Salama was injured in the battle of Ra's al-‚ÄòAyn and died on 2 June 1948. He was the father of Ali Hassan Salameh, chief of Black September and the man chiefly responsible of the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympics.The hunt for Black September References External links * Israel State Archives, British police file on Hasan Salama. 1912 births 1948 deaths Palestinian Arab nationalists Arab people in British Palestine German World War II special forces Arab collaborators with Nazi Germany Military personnel killed in action Palestinian people of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Palestinian military personnel Rebel commanders of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine SS officers ","title":"Hasan Salama"},{"id":"41132291","text":"The Army of the Holy War or Holy War Army (; Jaysh al-JihƒÅd al-Muqaddas) was a Palestinian Arab irregular force in the 1947-48 Palestinian civil war led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama.Hourani, 2004, p. 537.

In September 1940, he founded a breakaway militant Zionist group named Lehi, called the \\"Stern Gang\\" by the British authorities and by the mainstream in the Yishuv Jewish establishment.Nachman Ben-Yehuda. The Masada Myth: Collective Memory and Mythmaking in Israel. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1995. Pp. 322. Early life Stern was born in Suwa≈Çki, present-day Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). During the First World War his mother fled the Germans with him and his brother David. They found refuge with her sister in Russia. When he was separated from his mother the 13-year-old Avraham earned his keep by carrying river water in Siberia. Eventually, he stayed with an uncle in St. Petersburg before walking home to Poland. At the age of 18, in 1925, Stern emigrated on his own to Palestine.Zev Golan, Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues Who Created the State of Israel, p. 203 Stern studied at the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem. He specialized in Classical languages and literature (Greek and Latin). His first political involvement was to found a student organization called ‚ÄúHulda,‚Äù whose regulations stated it was dedicated ‚Äúsolely to the revival of the Hebrew nation in a new state.‚ÄùNechemia Ben-Tor, The Lehi Lexicon, p. 320 (Hebrew) During the 1929 riots in Palestine, Jewish communities came under attack by local Arabs, and Stern served with the Haganah, doing guard duty on a synagogue rooftop in Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City.Zev Golan, Free Jerusalem, p. 198 Stern‚Äôs commander and friend Avraham Tehomi quit the Haganah because it was under the authority of the local labor movement and union. Hoping to create an independent army, and also to take a more active and less defensive military position, Tehomi founded the Irgun Zvai Leumi (\\"National Military Organization\\" known for short as the \\"Organization\\"). Stern joined the Irgun and completed an officer‚Äôs course in 1932. During his life Stern wrote dozens of poems embodying a physical, almost sensual, love for the Jewish homeland and a similar attitude towards martyrdom on its behalf. One analyst referred to the poems as expressing the eroticism of death together with de-eroticism of women.Moshe Hazani: Red carpet, white lilies: Love of death in the poetry of the Jewish underground leader Avraham Stern, Psychoanalytic Review, vol. 89, 2002, pp 1-48 Stern‚Äôs poetry was heavily influenced by Russian and Polish poetry, especially Vladimir Mayakovsky‚Äôs.Yaira Ginossar, Not for Us the Saxophone Sings, pp. 73-78, 85 (Hebrew) His song Unknown Soldiers was adopted first by the Irgun and later by the Lehi as an underground anthem. In it Stern sang of Jews who would not be drafted by other countries while they wandered in Exile from their own country, but rather who would enlist in a volunteer army of their own, go underground and die fighting in the streets, only to be buried secretly at night. One of the commanders of Lehi, Israel Eldad, claimed this song (along with two others, written by Uri Zvi Greenberg and Vladimir Jabotinsky) actually led to the creation of the underground.Zev Golan, Free Jerusalem, p. 59 In other poems from the same period, up to eight years before he founded the Lehi underground, Stern detailed the feelings of revolutionaries hiding in basements or sitting in prison and wrote of dying in a hail of bullets. One example of his poetry is: ‚ÄúYou are betrothed to me, my homeland \\\\ According to all the laws of Moses and Israel‚Ä¶ \\\\ And with my death I will bury my head in your lap \\\\ And you will live forever in my blood.‚Äù Stern became one of the university‚Äôs top students. He was awarded a stipend to study for a doctorate in Florence, Italy. Avraham Tehomi made a special trip to Florence to recall him, in order to make him his deputy in the Irgun. Stern spent the rest of the 1930s traveling back and forth to Eastern Europe to organize revolutionary cells in Poland and promote immigration of Jews to Palestine in defiance of British restrictions (this was therefore known as ‚Äúillegal immigration‚Äù). Stern developed a plan to train 40,000 young Jews to sail for Palestine and take over the country from the British colonial authorities. He succeeded in enlisting the Polish government in this effort. The Poles began training Irgun members and arms were set aside, but then Germany invaded Poland and began the Second World War. This ended the training, and immigration routes were cut off.Zev Golan, Free Jerusalem, pp. 153, 168 Stern was in Palestine at the time and was arrested the same night the war began. He was incarcerated together with the entire High Command of the Irgun in the Jerusalem Central Prison and Sarafand Detention Camp. Lehi Flag of the Lehi movement. While under arrest, Stern and the other members of the Irgun argued about what to do during the war. He founded Lehi in August 1940 initially under a different name, it adopted the name Lehi, a Hebrew acronym for Lohamei Herut Israel, meaning Fighters for the Freedom of Israel, in September 1940. The movement was formed after Stern and others split from the Irgun, when the latter adopted the Haganah‚Äôs policy of supporting the British in their fight against the Nazis. Stern rejected collaboration with the British, and claimed that only a continuing struggle against them would lead eventually to an independent Jewish state and resolve the Jewish situation in the Diaspora. The British White Paper of 1939 allowed only 75,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine over five years, and no more after that unless local Arabs gave their permission.J. Bowyer Bell, Terror Out of Zion, pp. 47-48 But actually Stern‚Äôs opposition to British colonial rule in Palestine was not based on a particular policy; Stern defined the British Mandate as ‚Äúforeign rule‚Äù regardless of their policies and took a radical position against such imperialism even if it were to be benevolent.Israel Eldad, The First Tithe, p. 84 Lehi Museum in Tel Aviv. The room where Abraham Stern, Lehi commander, was shot by a British policeman on 12/2/1942. Stern was unpopular with the official Jewish establishment leaders of the Haganah and Jewish Agency and also those of the Irgun. His movement drew an eclectic crew of individuals, from all ends of the political spectrum, including people who became prominent such as Yitzhak Shamir, later an Israeli prime minister, who supported Jewish settlement throughout the land, and who opposed ceding territory to Arabs in negotiations; Natan Yellin-Mor who later became a leader of the peace movement in Israel advocating negotiations and accommodation with the Palestinians, and Israel Eldad, who after the underground war ended spent nearly 15 years writing tracts and articles promoting extreme right wing, nationalist brand of Zionism. Stern began organizing his new underground army by focusing on four fronts: 1) publishing a newspaper and making clandestine radio broadcasts offering theoretical justifications for urban guerilla warfare; 2) obtaining funds for the underground, either by donations or by robbing British banks; 3) opening negotiations with foreign powers for the purpose of saving Europe‚Äôs Jews and developing allies in the struggle against the British in Palestine; 4) actual military-style operations against the British. None of these projects went well for the new underground. Without money or a printing press the stenciled newspapers were few and hard to read. The bank robberies and operations against British policemen resulted in shootouts in the streets and both British and Jewish police were killed and injured. A British sting operation entrapped Stern into attempting to negotiate with the Italians and Germans, and this further tainted Lehi‚Äôs reputation.Nechemia Ben-Tor, The Lehi Lexicon, p. 87 (Hebrew) In January 1941, Stern attempted to make an agreement with the German Nazi authorities, offering to \\"actively take part in the war on Germany's side\\" in return for German support for Jewish immigration to Palestine and the establishment of a Jewish state. Another attempt to contact the Germans was made in late 1941, but there is no record of a German response in either case.Heller, J. (1995). The Stern Gang. Frank Cass. These appeals to Germany were in direct opposition to the views of other Zionists, such as Ze'ev Jabotinsky, who wanted Britain to defeat the Nazis even as they wanted to expel the British from Palestine.Elliot Jager, \\"Terror Out of Zion,\\" Jewish Ideas Daily. Death Grave of Avraham Stern in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery. Wanted posters appeared all over the country with a price on Stern‚Äôs head. Stern wandered from safe house to safe house in Tel Aviv, carrying a collapsible cot in a suitcase. When he ran out of hiding places he slept in apartment house stairwells. Eventually, he moved into a Tel Aviv apartment rented by Moshe and Tova Svorai, who were members of Lehi. Moshe Svorai was caught by British detectives who raided another apartment, where two Lehi members were shot dead, and Svorai and one other wounded were hospitalized. Stern‚Äôs Lehi ‚Äúcontact‚Äù, Hisia Shapiro, thought she might have been followed one morning and stopped bringing messages. On 12 February 1942, she came with one last message, from the Haganah, offering to house Stern for the duration of the war if he would give up his fight against the British. Stern gave Shapiro a letter in reply declining the safe haven and suggesting cooperation between Lehi and the Haganah in fighting the British. A couple of hours later British detectives arrived to search the apartment and discovered Stern hiding there. It was the mother of one of the \\"Lehi\\" members who inadvertently led the police to Stern's hiding place in Tel Aviv. Two neighbors were brought to attest to the propriety of the search. After they had left, Tova Svorai was also taken away so that Stern was alone with three armed policemen. Then, in circumstances that remain disputed today, Stern was shot dead.Zev Golan, Free Jerusalem, pp. 231-234Zev Golan, Stern: The Man and His Gang, pp. 41-45I. Black, \\"The Stern Solution\\", The Guardian, Feb 15, 1992, page 4. The \\"most secret\\" report made by the police to the British mandatory government said, \\"Stern was ... just finishing lacing his shoes when he suddenly leapt for the window opposite. He was halfway out of the window when he was shot by two of the three policemen in the room.\\" Assistant Superintendent Geoffrey J. Morton, the most senior policeman present, later wrote in his memoirs that he had feared Stern was about to set off an explosive device as he had previously threatened to do if captured.Geoffrey Morton, Just The Job, Some Experiences of a Colonial Policeman, pp. 144-145 The police version was dismissed by Stern's followers and others, who believed that Stern had been shot in cold blood.Hyams, Edward (1975) Terrorists and Terrorism Hyams puts it bluntly: \\"Stern was 'shot while trying to escape'.\\" Morton successfully sued four publishers of books which claimed he murdered Stern, including the English publisher of The Revolt, which settled without consulting the author, Menachem Begin, who wanted to go to court.Max Seligman, attorney for M. Begin, letter to Oswald Hickson, Collier and Co., Solicitors, March 25, 1953, file no. 923, in Jabotinsky Institute Archives, file 49/3/13 Lehi tried unsuccessfully to assassinate Morton at least three times. Binyamin Gepner, a former Lehi member who in 1980 interviewed another policeman Stewart who had been present at Stern's death, said that Stewart had effectively admitted Stern was murdered but later refused to repeat it. The policeman whose gun was trained on Stern until Morton arrived, Bernard Stamp, said in a 1986 interview broadcast on Israel Radio, that Morton's account was \\"hogwash.\\" According to Stamp, Morton pulled Stern from the couch on which he was sitting, \\"sort of pushed him, spun him around, and Morton shot him.\\" Stamp has been cited saying Stern was killed while unarmed with no chance of escape.Zev Golan, Stern: The Man and His Gang, p. 45 Tova Svorai recalled in a memoir: \\"At about 9:30 there was a knock at the door, too gentle a tapping to signal the presence of the police. Yair‚Ä¶went into the closet, and only then did I open the door. At the door stood the 'good' detective Wilkins with two men behind him. Wilkins was always very polite, too polite perhaps. He asked me why I hadn't gone to visit my husband Moshe and if I weren't worried about him. I told him that if I had gone to the hospital I would have been arrested immediately. They searched my room‚Ä¶then they went downstairs and brought two neighbors, women, so they might have witnesses‚Ä¶they went over to the closet‚Ä¶one of the policemen opened it. Yair was nowhere to be seen. The policemen thrust his left hand into the closet and began searching, and when his hand came upon Yair he pulled him out. At the same time, he put his right hand into his back pocket and took out his gun. I ran between him and Yair and said \\"Don't shoot! If you shoot, you shoot me\\"‚Ä¶. in my innocence I thought I had saved Yair's life‚Ä¶how wrong I was. They made him sit on the sofa‚Ä¶more detectives appeared, they had handcuffs and used them to bind Yair's hands behind his back‚Ä¶.they told me to get dressed and go downstairs‚Ä¶I got into a small car‚Ä¶suddenly I heard three shots.\\" (Moshe and Tova Svorai, From Etzel to Lehi: A Personal Story, self-published, 1989, p363) His son, Yair, born a few months after Stern's killing, is a veteran broadcast journalist and TV news anchor who once headed Israel Television. Honours A memorial ceremony attended by Israeli politicians and government officials is held each year at Stern's grave in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim. In 1978, a postage stamp was issued in his honor. In 1981, the town of Kochav Yair (Yair's Star) was founded and named after Stern's nickname. The place \\"where he was shot is a museum and place of pilgrimage for a growing number of hard-right youths\\".Making of a martyr: How the killing of the head of the Stern gang echoes down the years, economist.com.

It is the senior see of Greece, and the seat of the autocephalous Church of Greece. Its incumbent (since 2008) is Ieronymos II of Athens. As the head of the Church of Greece, the holder is styled Archbishop of Athens and All Greece (ŒëœÅœáŒπŒµœÄŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩœéŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒ¨œÉŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ). History As with most of Greece, the Church of Athens was established by St. Paul during his second missionary journey, when he preached at the Areopagus, probably in 50 or 51 AD. According to the Acts of the Apostles (17:16‚Äì34), after the sermon, a number of people became followers of Paul, thus forming the kernel of the Church in Athens. Dionysius the Areopagite was the first Bishop of Athens. With the Christianization of the Roman Empire and the establishment of a regular Church hierarchy, Athens became a suffragan see of the Metropolis of Corinth, the metropolitan see of the Roman province of Achaea. As with most of Greece, however, the old pagan religion continued for considerable time. Despite imperial prohibitions during the 4th century, there is considerable evidence for a flourishing pagan culture up to the end of the century, and it was probably only the devastation of the Gothic raids in 395‚Äì397 that dealt a first hard blow to the ancient pagan culture. The last pagan vestiges in Athens itself survived until the 6th century and the closure of the city's Neoplatonic Academy by Justinian I in 529. As with the rest of the Illyricum, Athens belonged originally to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Rome, but the progressive strengthening of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and the changing political circumstances of the 7th century led finally to the subordination of the entire Eastern Illyricum to Constantinople in . Despite the occasional appointment of its bishop as papal vicar‚Äîchiefly in an attempt to shore up Rome's position in the area‚ÄîAthens itself remained firmly subordinated to Corinth during the early Byzantine period. Due to the influence of Empress Irene of Athens, the see was raised to the rank of a metropolis sometime after 765, but this was short-lived and was reversed after the protests of the Metropolitan of Corinth. Nevertheless, by 819 Athens had become an autocephalous archbishopric, and in the ecumenical councils of 869/70 and 879, the see of Athens appears as a metropolis, but the preserved inscriptions on the Parthenon show that this was not permanent. The power struggle with Corinth was finally settled until 975, when Athens was permanently raised to the status of a separate metropolis. In the various Notitiae Episcopatuum of the 8th and 9th centuries, the position of Athens in the hierarchy of the metropolises under Constantinople fluctuates, but is relatively low (34th out of 37 in Notitia 2, and 48th out of 49 in Notitia 3). It rose to 28th place by , a place it held for the next three centuries. Its jurisdiction encompassed the southeastern parts of the province (theme) of Hellas, i.e. southeastern Central Greece and the nearest of the Cyclades. The original suffragans of Athens were, in order: Euripus, Dauleia, Koroneia, Andros, Oreos, Skyros, Karystos, Porthmos, Aulon, and Syros. With the exception of the addition of the sees of \\"Kea and Thermia\\" and of Megara in the middle of the 12th century, the list remained the same until the Fourth Crusade. At the time of the Fourth Crusade, the see of Athens was in the hands of Michael Choniates. Refusing to acknowledge the authority of the Pope, he was forced to abandon his see, which became a Roman Catholic archbishopric under the Frenchman Berard. Based on a 1209 letter by Pope Innocent III, the list of suffragans under Latin rule only slightly changed: Euripus (Egripontis), Thermopylae (Cermopilensem, seat in Bodonitsa), Dauleia (Davaliensem), Aulon (Abelonensem), Oreos (Zorconensem), Karystos (Caristiensem), Koroneia (Coroniacensem), Andros (Andrensem), Megara (Megarensem), Skyros (Squirensem), and Kea (Cheensem), although most of these sees were vacant. In 1212, the formerly autocephalous archbishopric of Aegina, and the newly founded see of Salona (Salonensis) also appear as Athens' suffragans. The Catholic see remained vacant for a period after the Catalan Company conquered the Duchy of Athens in 1311 due to the Catalans' conflict with the papacy, and a residential archbishop is not attested until around the mid-14th century. For the duration of the Frankish rule, the Orthodox see had continued to be filled in exile, either with titular holders or with bishops of other sees functioning as stewards (proedros) of the archiepiscopal see of Athens. The Orthodox clergy were consecrated by passing bishops, but were forced to acknowledge the authority of the Latin Archbishop in order to exercise their office. In the Byzantine Notitiae of the period, Athens fell in rank to 35th place under Andronikos II Palaiologos (), rose to 28th under Andronikos III Palaiologos (), and rose to 21st place by the turn of the 15th century. In 1388, the Duchy of Athens passed into the hands of the Florentine Acciaioli family. With little military might of their own, and surrounded by potential rivals and enemies, the Acciaioli cultivated a policy of conciliation towards the overwhelmingly Orthodox local Greek population. To that end, they adopted Greek as the official language of their chancery, and allowed an Orthodox metropolitan, Dorotheus, to resume residence in their capital. The cathedral Church of the Virgin in the Parthenon remained the residence of the Latin Archbishop of Athens, however, and Dorotheus used the small church of Dionysius the Areopagite in the lower city. This situation prevailed until the Ottoman conquest of the city in 1456, when the Latin see was abolished and the Orthodox metropolitans were restored to their former position. In accordance with the Ottoman millet system, the metropolitan became also the chairman of the council of the community of Athens. The metropolitan cathedral in the Parthenon, however, was converted into a mosque, and the metropolitan bishop instead used the Church of St. Panteleimon, now destroyed. Following the Greek War of Independence and the declaration of the autocephaly of the Church of Greece in 1833, the Church was reorganized and the Bishopric of Attica (ŒïœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒÆ ŒëœÑœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ) was established, with its jurisdiction covering the Attica Prefecture. Following the recognition of the autocephaly by the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1850, the bishopric was raised again to metropolitan rank and renamed to Metropolis of Athens. As the sole metropolitan see of the independent Kingdom of Greece, its incumbent was assigned the permanent presidency of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece. This situation lasted until 1922, when all episcopal sees in Greece were raised to metropolitan status. As a result, on 31 December 1923 the new Constitutional Charter of the Church of Greece raised the bishop of Athens to the position of Archbishop of Athens and All Greece.

The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in limited theatrical release in the United States by Sony Pictures Classics on January 31, 2014.  Synopsis  The Music Lesson by Johannes Vermeer Tim Jenison is an inventor and successful founder of NewTek, a company working in various fields of computer graphics, most notably the 3D modeling software \\"LightWave 3D.\\" Jenison, himself both an engineer and art enthusiast, becomes fascinated with the paintings of Johannes Vermeer, a 17th-century Dutch painter whose paintings have often been said to exhibit a photographic quality. Jenison, spurred by the book Secret Knowledge by British artist David Hockney and Vermeer's Camera by British architecture professor Philip Steadman, theorizes that Vermeer potentially used a camera obscura to guide his painting technique. His initial idea, that Vermeer used a simple light projection to paint, is quickly discarded after concluding that painting over a projection makes it nearly impossible to match the colors correctly. Jenison then has an epiphany of using a mirror to monitor parts of the picture: by placing a small, fixed mirror above the canvas at a 45-degree angle, he is able to view parts of the original image and the canvas simultaneously, and obtain a precise color match by continuously comparing the reflection of the original image with what he has put on the canvas, moving from area to area by simply moving his own point-of-view slightly. When the edge of the mirror \\"disappears\\", he has it right. Building a quick, crude prototype and using a photographic portrait of his father-in-law, Jenison produces an oil painting that looks nearly identical to the photograph. After building a prototype with a lens that is able to capture a real-life object, Steadman and Jenison, neither of whom has classic artistic education, take turns painting and produce an impressive oil painting of a vase. Both Hockney and Steadman note that their respective books have caused controversies in the art historian circles, who viewed the theory as an \\"intrusion of crass rationalists\\" and \\"the misunderstanding of the nature of art\\". Jenison believes he may be able to reproduce The Music Lesson as a painting with this technique, and plans to physically recreate the original scene; first he models the entire painting in LightWave, then proceeds with a painstaking process of re-creating the objects and setting within the original scene, which includes him doing woodworking, turning on a lathe, and almost an entire year of handiwork. Jenison also insists on using only techniques available to Vermeer in the 17th century, mixing his own paint and polishing his own lens. Once the scene is set and is visually identical to the original painting, Jenison sits down and meticulously begins to paint. During his process, he observes a variety of oddities of Vermeer's work that he attributes to the theory of Vermeer having mechanical help: He notes Vermeer's hyper-accurate recreation of diffuse lighting would be impossible to recreate by simple eyesight because of color constancy. He also observes that some of Vermeer's work features chromatic aberration and depth of field, two distinct features of a photographic lens but not of the human eye. While painting the virginal, he accidentally notices that while he used a straightedge to roughly sketch out the outline of the instrument, the curvature of the lens almost caused him to add a slight curvature to the virginal's seahorse-pattern itself. Curious, he looks at a print of the original painting and notices that the original painting has the same curvature in the pattern. After seven months, Jenison finally finishes painting the picture, and after adding a layer of varnish, he has an emotional moment taking a final look at his work. Observing the results of his work, Steadman and Hockney both feel confident in their theory that Vermeer had been using the same (or similar) tools to create his paintings, noting that \\"the painting itself is a document\\". The final shot of the film is Jenison, with his copy of The Music Lesson above his fireplace.  Reception  Tim's Vermeer has been met with positive reviews from film reviewers and technology enthusiasts. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 89% based on 107 reviews, with the consensus reading: \\"Entertaining and profound in equal measure, Tim's Vermeer uses its seemingly esoteric subject to pose fascinating questions about art and obsession\\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Art critics Jonathan Jones and Bendor Grosvenor have criticized the film and disagreed with its conclusions. Jones wrote in the Guardian: \\"The technology Jenison relies on can replicate art, but it does so synthetically, with no understanding of art's inner life.

He is the founder and former chairman of CPP Group plc. Personal life The son of a dental surgeon, Ogston was educated at Cranleigh School. At the age of 18, he left the UK. His father gave him ¬£50 at Euston Station and didn't see him again for a year. Ogston joined the Norwegian Merchant Navy, which took him to work across Canada. From here he joined a ship in the German Merchant Navy, leading him to travel and work in New Zealand, Australia and Tahiti. He worked his way around the world on building sites in Toronto, farms in New Zealand and in the advertising department of Esso in Sydney, Australia. Ogston subsequently attended Manchester University, where he studied Management Sciences, graduating in 1970. Business career Upon leaving Manchester University in 1970, Ogston co-founded Countdown PLC ‚Äì Europe's first retail loyalty card company that eventually operated in 16 countries. In 1977 Ogston co-founded Supreme Awards, which he sold to Luncheon Vouchers. Ogston also co-founded the Guinness World of Records Museum at London's Trocadero in 1979. In 1980 he was one of the original investors in the marketing rights to the FIFA World Cup in Spain and launched Sportsworld Gp plc, a specialist hospitality, travel and event services company delivering sporting and cultural occasions such as the Olympic Games and Football World Cups. According to the Sunday Times RIch List in 2020, Ogston is worth an estimated ¬£131 million, a decrease of ¬£21 million from the previous year. CPP In 1980 Ogston founded Card Protection Plan Ltd., which successfully grew into what became the CPP Group (CPP). He persevered for 13 years before the company fully recovered its startup losses and 21 years before it paid its first dividend. Ogston was also tested by a 12.5 year legal battle with Customs and Excise (HMRC) which went through 6 courts, including the House of Lords and the European Court of Justice, before coming out the victor. The judgment became a landmark case and is the most cited in VAT history. CPP grew into a company operating in 16 countries with over 11.2 million customers, 200 business partners worldwide and 2,220 employees. Ogston's involvement in the day-to-day management of CPP ceased in 1999, but he continued to serve as the company's non-executive chairman. He retained this position until January 2010, although from July 2004 he handed over the responsibility for chairing and administering the board to Mr. Colin Lloyd, the senior independent non-executive director. In March 2010 CPP floated on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. Ogston stayed on as a non-executive director until June 2013 The UK FSA announced an investigation into two of the products sold by CPP in March 2011. Prior to the investigation, CPP was valued at ¬£533m. However, the uncertainty caused by the FSA forced CPP to suspend its shares on 20 February 2012 and, due to the support offered by Ogston, was able to relist five weeks later, and according to Stock Exchange records, is only the second company to return to a full listing in its original form. The FSA's investigation concluded in November 2012 with the imposition of a civil financial penalty of ¬£10.5 million. The FSA disciplinary notice acknowledges that CPP took a number of steps to improve systems and controls during the relevant period. In an August 2013 telephone conversation with the Press Association, Ogston remarked that the compensation figure set by the FSA was 'ridiculous.' The comment referred to the process of calculating the figure, which assumed a 100% success rate of the compensation scheme, but it was later misinterpreted by media outlets. Ogston was subsequently proved right when the payout was a third of the figure published by the FCA. Although media accusations suggested that the Card Protection Plan policy was 'largely useless' and 'unnecessary,' only 1 out of the 18 benefits offered by the policy was subject to criticism by the FSA and FSA's Final Notice acknowledged that the policy offered a number of other features. Philanthropy Ogston is one of Yorkshire's biggest philanthropists and in 2008 he gave ¬£2m to York Minster, helping the Minster reach its target for vital restoration work to start. At the request of York City Council, he provided the initial funding to commission a report on the possible development of 100 acres of brown field site in the centre of York. He is a Vice-President of the Georgian Theatre Royal, Richmond, North Yorkshire and a former benefactor of the Oxford Philharmonic Trust. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Hamish's charitable foundation gave ¬£375,000 to the Georgian Theatre Royal to fund part of a project to upgrade the historic auditorium. In 2009 Ogston funded the construction of Cranleigh School's new organ, a project undertaken by the renowned organ maker Mander Organs. In 2011 Ogston pledged NZ$4m to help rebuild Christchurch Cathedral, New Zealand following the earthquake. In March 2014, after seeing nothing had been done with the building, he reiterated his offer and recommended the establishment of foundation to oversee construction work. He has also donated the cost of building the Life Sciences building at St Edward's School, Oxford and in July 2013 the building was formally named the Ogston Building. Through his support and further donations, St Edward's School has also been able to acquire a site for a new and much bigger music school, which has been named The Ogston Music School. During November 2017, it was announced that Ogston had donated ¬£384,000 to Liverpool Cathedral for the renovation of the organ, which is the UK's largest pipe organ. This was celebrated by a special service at which Ogston's hot air balloon was inflated inside the Cathedral's Main Space.http://www.liverpoolcathedral.org.uk/43/section.aspx/37/up_up_and_away__liverpool_cathedral_inflates_hot_air_balloon_in_main_space Ogston has played a role in the rejuvenation of Rangoon General Hospital. At the behest of the Burmese leader of the opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ogston held discussions with seven British university medical schools, to find one that would be prepared to rebuild the Hospital's healthcare system and provide a degree course for the brightest Burmese medical students. The leading candidate was University College London Medical School, who submitted an outline proposal to Aung San Suu Kyi in her role as head of the hospital rejuvenation committee.http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons- committees/international-development/Formal- Mins-2013-14-ConsolidatedVersion.pdf Awards Hamish Ogston was appointed a CBE in 2011 for services to business and the community in York.

It is considered by some to be of Inca origin--and as such the oldest and deepest expression of Quechua literature--while others believe it to be of colonial Hispanic origin.Hills, Brokaw, V.C. The oldest known manuscript of Ollantay belonged to the priest Antonio Vald√©s (18th century), who for some time was thought to be the original author; however, other differing manuscripts have been found that suggest the existence of a common, more remote, origin.Hills, Brokaw The most widely accepted theory is that the story is of Incan origin and was preserved through oral tradition until it was adapted for theatrical presentation in colonial times. Ollantay was first published in 1857 by Johann Jakob von Tschudi, in Quechua and German. The first Spanish version appeared in Lima in 1868, published by Jos√© Sebasti√°n Barranca and subtitled \\"The tribulations of a father and the generosity of a king\\" (Los rigores de un padre y la generosidad de un rey); since then different versions have been published in a variety of languages. Possible authors It was first assumed that Antonio Vald√©s, priest of Sicuani, was the author of Ollantay. English historian Clements R. Markham proposed this in the 19th century, and many others assumed it to be correct, including Dr. Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea. However, this theory of authorship has two major shortcomings: (1) there is no direct documentation indicating such an origin; (2) Vald√©s is not known to have written any other piece of literature or any other historical work. It seems more likely that this priest's contribution was limited to simply copying decaying manuscripts that he encountered in La Paz or other cities. It was also suggested that the author was Justo Pastor Justiniani, but evidence later surfaced indicating that he served only as a copyist. Similarly, Juan Espinoza Medrano (aka El Lunarejo), a celebrated mestizo writer of the 17th century, was also considered a possible author. The lack of any documentary evidence supporting these possibilities has been taken to indicate a more likely pre-colonial origin for the play. Three hypotheses for its origin Three hypotheses have emerged regarding the origin of Ollantay: *Inca hypothesis: *Hispanic hypothesis: *Hispanic-Incan hypothesis: Copies of Ollantay There are six original copies of this play. One is from around 1770 and attributed to the priest Antonio Vald√©s, and is held in the Convent of Santo Domingo in Cuzco, Peru. Two are believed to be derived from this one, written by Dr. Justo Pastor Justiniani and Justo Apu Sahuaraura Inca, and held in the General Archive of the Nation of Peru and the National Library of Peru, respectively. Two others are found in the Dominican Convert of Cuzco, and the third was published by Johann Jakob von Tschudi on the basis of a manuscript with origins in La Paz, Bolivia. Structure Ollantay is divided into three acts. It is written predominantly in octosyllable verse alternating with hendecasyllable verse, and contains both blank verse and assonant rhyme. Plot summary A general of the Inca armies, Ollantay is a warrior of commoner origin that has been decorated and elevated to the nobility in return for his service to the empire. He falls in love with Cusi Coyllur (or Kusi Quyllur, \\"happy star\\"), the daughter of the Inca ruler Pachacutec, but this love is prohibited due to his commoner background. Nevertheless, blinded by love, he pursues a secret relationship with Cusi Coyllur, a secret shared only with the Queen Ccoya Anahuarqui. Despite ominous omens from the Inca high priest, Ollantay decides to ask the Inca king for his daughter's hand. Pachacutec, reminding Ollantay of his humble origins, reproaches Ollantay for his audacity and angrily expels him from the court. Cusi Coyllur is then imprisoned in the Acllahuasi (\\"house of chosen women\\") where she is to expiate her sins; there she gives birth to a baby girl, fruit of her love with Ollantay, that she names Ima Sumac (\\"how beautiful\\"). Ollantay, on learning that Cusi Coyllur is no longer in the palace, believes that she has been murdered and decides to leave the imperial capital Cusco together with his servant and confidant Piqui Chaqui (\\"flea foot\\"). He threatens to one day return and destroy Cusco, then flees to the city which carries his name, Ollantaytambo, where he and his followers arm themselves and prepare for battle. The Inca ruler Pachacutec orders his general Rumi Nawi (\\"Stone-eyed\\") to gather forces and march to confront Ollantay. Ollantay sends his general Orqo Waranka (\\"A thousand mountains\\") to ambush Rumi Nawi in a mountain pass, defeating Rumi's forces but allowing him to escape. Other battles ensue. Ten years later Pachacutec dies without having defeated Ollantay, and his son Tupac Yupanqui succeeds him. Meanwhile, in the Acllahuasi, Cusi Coyllur has endured hardship at the hands of Mama Caca (\\"Stone Mother\\") but also found an ally in Pitu Salla (\\"Twinned Love\\"), who has raised Cusi's daughter Ima Sumac as her own. When Ima accidentally discovers her true heritage, she proposes to go to the new Inca king and ask for clemency for her mother. At the same time, new Inca ruler Tupac Yupanqui resolves to finally defeat and capture Ollantay, and sends Rumi Nawi, who promises to redeem his earlier failure. Rumi Nawi employs a deceptive plan: he presents himself at the gates of Ollantaytambo covered in wounds, pretending that the new Inca ruler has abused him and suggesting that he would like to join Ollantay's rebellion. When the gates are opened, Rumi Nawi's men capture Ollantay, Orqo Waranka, and other rebels without resistance, eventually bringing them to Cusco to face Tupac Yupanqui's judgement. After consultation with his advisors and his generals, Tupac condemns the prisoners to death, but then reverses himself at the last minute and not only pardons them, but decides to give them high-ranking posts in the empire. Ollantay is named the senior general and deputy of the Inca ruler, while Orqo Waranka is named ruler of the state of Antisuyu. Soon afterwards, Ima Sumac enters the imperial palace to ask for clemency for her imprisoned mother. Although Tupac doesn't yet know whom this is, he takes an interest in the case and together with Ollantay goes to the Acllahuasi. There they find a woman with very long hair and a ghostly appearance that Tupac finally recognizes as his sister in a moment of anagnorisis. Cusi Coyllur tells her story, and a magnanimous Tupac Yupanqui frees her and immediately gives her hand to Ollantay, ending the Inca drama on a happy note. References * Hills, E. C. (1914).

Since its discovery in unknown circumstances in the nineteenth century, it has belonged to a variety of owners, including various members of the House of Braganza, for which it is named, before being purchased by the British Museum in 2001.British Museum Collection . Celtic Warrior on the brooch Description This heavy gold brooch is dominated by the figure of a naked warrior who wears a Celtic helmet and protects himself with a Celtic shield and sword from a hunting dog which jumps up to him. Each end of the fibula is decorated by a dog's head and it once furnished a spring and pin which is now lost. The form, style and technique suggest that it was made in the third century BC by a Greek jeweller for a Celtic patron who lived on the Iberian Peninsula. Contemporary Iberian brooches were usually made of silver and were often decorated with warriors on horseback accompanied by hunting dogs. In this unique gold version, the craftsman has simplified the hunting scene and added a boar's head, which once served as the sliding catch for the now missing pin. The brooch measures approximately 14 cm long. Ownership The brooch was once in the collection of the Royal House of Braganza and was perhaps collected by Fernando II, consort of Queen Maria of Portugal. Most of the jewellery of the Braganza dynasty was inherited in 1919 by HRH Nevada of Portugal, Princess d'Braganza and Duchesse d'Oporto who later emigrated to America. On her death in 1941, the collection was sold to Warren Piper of Chicago. The brooch was in turn purchased by Thomas F Flannery Jr in 1950. After being loaned to the British Museum for 7 years, it was purchased by the museum in 2001. See also *Cordoba Treasure *Orense Torcs Further reading *M.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the Diocese of Oxford. History The church, designed by George Gilbert Scott, who also designed the Martyr's Memorial and the Exeter College Chapel, was built in 1848‚Äì49, to serve the spiritual needs of those living and working in the then-active quarry. Its foundation stone was laid on 19 June 1848 by Samuel Wilberforce, the son of William Wilberforce and then Bishop of Oxford, who consecrated the building on completion. The Lewis brothers, C. S. Lewis and Warren Lewis, began attending here in 1930 and remained active in this church until their deaths, C. S. Lewis in 1963 and W. H. Lewis in 1973. Above the altar is the Christ in Glory stained glass window, installed in 1951 as a memorial to those who died in World War II. It was designed by Sir J. Ninian Comper. The cloth behind the altar was hung in 1994, and represents the three angels who visited Abraham according to Genesis 18. The chancel organ was built by Kenneth Tickell and installed in 1992. The church is known for its Narnia window, which features images from C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. It was commissioned from Sally Scott, a painter and glass engraver, and installed in the north aisle in 1991. It was bequeathed by George and Kathleen Howe (nee Clark), who lived at 38 Grovelands Road in Risinghurst close to the Lewis brothers in memory of their children, William G. and Gillian Margaret, who both died young. Willie died in 1955, aged 16, and Gillian shortly after her birth in 1945. Both are buried in the churchyard.Ancestry Records The window contains a lamp post, the word \\"Narnia,\\" Glimfeather the owl, the flying horse Fledge, the sword, shield, and bottle of cordial from the story of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Dawn Treader, the castle Cair Paravel, Susan's horn and bow with quiver, and talking animals.

Between 1905 and 1908, the German Administration in German South West Africa acquired fifteen Class Hb tank locomotives with a 0-6-2 wheel arrangement for lease to the Otavi Mining and Railway Company. Six of these locomotives survived to be taken onto the roster of the South African Railways after the First World War.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1947). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, October 1947. p. 859. Manufacturer By 1905, the rapid progress with the construction of the Otavi Railway called for heavier and more powerful locomotives. Between 1905 and 1908, fifteen narrow gauge 0-6-2 tank and tank-and-tender steam locomotives were built for the German Administration in German South West Africa (GSWA) by Henschel and Son in Germany. They were designated Class Hb and numbered in the range from 51 to 65.Henschel-Lieferliste (Henschel & Son works list), compiled by Dietmar Stresow The locomotives were leased to the Otavi Mining and Railway Company, who operated the narrow gauge Otavi Railway which was being constructed across the Namib Desert between Swakopmund and Tsumeb, to augment their mainline locomotive fleet. Characteristics The locomotives used Allan valve gear and were equipped with dust covers to protect the motion from wind-blown sand in the Namib Desert. The \\"Hb\\" classification identified the locomotive type as the second class to have been built for GSWA by Henschel. They were delivered in four batches. * The first three tank locomotives were delivered in 1905, with works numbers in the range from 7298 to 7300 and numbered in the range from 51 to 53. * Four more followed in 1906, with works numbers in the range from 7623 to 7626 and numbered in the range from 54 to 57. * Two arrived in 1907, with works numbers 8610 and 8611 and numbered 64 and 65. * Six were delivered in 1908, with works numbers in the range from 7740 to 7745 and numbered in the range from 58 to 63. These last six locomotives were delivered as tank-and-tender engines, equipped with optional coal and water tenders. Service Photographic evidence show that some of these locomotives were eventually permanently converted to tender engines by removing their side tanks. During the First World War, the former German Colony came under South African administration and the railways in GSWA came under control of the Union Defence Forces. Control of all railway operations in South West Africa (SWA) was passed on from the Military to the Director of Railways in Windhoek on 1 August 1915. On 1 April 1922, all the railway lines and rolling stock in the territory became part of the South African Railways. Six of these locomotives, numbers 51, 54, 56, 61, 62 and 65, survived into the SAR era. They retained their German Colonial Hb classification and engine numbers while in SAR service. All but one were scrapped after they were withdrawn from service in 1942. Engine no. 56 has been preserved, coupled to a short period train at the Alte Feste museum in Windhoek.

The committee was made of a group of dedicated to the research and development of space-related sciences, and to demonstrate Israeli capabilities to its antagonistic neighbors at the time, especially Egypt. History Shavit launcher being operated by the Israel Space Agency = 1960s = The Israeli Space Agency originated as university-based research project from Tel-Aviv University in the early 1960s. In 1960, the National Committee for Space Research (NCSR) was formed by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The committee was formed to increase research activities across the academic communities in Israel. While at the time, establishing a space program was not particularly one of its goals, during the '60s through the late '70s, the committee developed the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and sciences. One of the NCSR's earliest achievements took place in 1961 with the launch of its first two-stage rocket. = Reliance on foreign countries = At the same time, Israel's missile program was also established. As with other countries, the ballistic and other missile development took precedence over space. The Israeli Space Launch Vehicle (SLVs) was developed as an off-shot of its Ballistic Missile (BM) program. This interdependency resulted in a blurry line between civilian and military developments in Israel. Contractors, such as IAI, that were responsible for building defense missiles were also the main contractors for the Shavit space rocket. Due to the stressed relationship between Israel and its neighbors, Israel has always attempted to acquire intelligence from various sources. During the late 60s it was thought that the IDF received satellite imagery from the US; however the resolution was degraded, the coverage was limited, and it was not in real-time. Following the Yom Kippur War, Israel started changing their focus to developing an independent source of space-based intelligence. This opinion was strengthen after it became known that the US withheld critical intelligence information during the war, obtained by reconnaissance satellites, on Arab offensive formation. Despite the close defense corporation with the US, Israel did not have routine access to real- time satellite intelligence data. The Defense Ministry was quoted saying \\"For years we have been begging the Americans for more detailed pictures from their satellites and often got refusals - even when Iraqi Scud missiles were falling on Tel Aviv...\\" = Proposal for Israeli satellite = Following the political tension by Egypt and Syria, reconnaissance flights became evermore difficult. In 1979, then, Israel's DMI, Major General Yehoshua Sagi told the defense ministry that the only solution was overhead photography satellite which would bypass the political obstacles and take imagery of points of interests without generating diplomatic problems. The idea was met with great resistance; nevertheless a feasibility study projects was initiated on the production of satellite launcher, satellites, and telescope cameras by the Israel Aerospace Industries, the Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and Electro-Optics industries. The three contractors were asked to complete their study in ten months. The study was completed by late 1980; Saguy requested from prime minister Menachem Begin that the project proceed to its next phase. While the project received the go-ahead, Israel's defense industries suffered significant budget shortage following the Iranian Revolution when military corporation between the two countries ended. The financial constraint were slowly resolved by IAI tying up with South Africa for budgetary support. In 1982, a new recommendation called \\"Ofeq Program\\" was submitted for developing an observation satellite. The program included timelines, planning for a ground station, budget estimates, and personnel requirements. The primary goals was to develop a satellite program without relying on any foreign know- how, to allow flexibility and creativity. The launcher would be developed by Malam, the two engines by the Israel Military Industries (IMI), and the third by Rafael. = Establishment of a Space Agency = At the end of 1982 it was decided during a closed-door meeting to establish and Israeli space agency. The decision was made by PM Menachem Begin, Defense minister Ariel Sharon, and former director Aharon Beit Halahmi. The initial goal was to pursue the program to develop to Ofeq and the Shavit launchers. In January 1983, the Israeli government authorized the Minister of Science and Technology Prof. Yuval Ne'eman to establish an Israeli Space Agency with the goal of advancing Israel's space program, unlike the NCSR which was primarily used for feasibility and infrastructure studies. In July 1983, the ISA was official founded in Tel Aviv to coordinate the nation's space program in affiliation to the Ministry of Science, Culture & Sport.

Erected in the 1st century AD, it has been classified as a French monument historique since 7 August 1890.  History  The original Roman settlers at Aix-les-Bains (Roman: Aquae) seem to have arrived in the 1st century,Canal, Alain (sous la dir.). Rapport des fouilles en sauvetage sous la place Maurice Mollard. Lyon, Drac (dact.), 1992. on account of the presence of hot springs (see Thermae).General Inventory of the Heritage of Aixes: Arch of Campanus , by Jo√´l Lagrange et Marie-Reine Jaz√©-Charvolin. Linked administratively to the city of Vienne, the city was a vicus with a council of decemlecti (municipal council of ten members).Epigraphic Texts in the Aix-les-Baines Museum of Inscriptions. The city possessed important thermae in the very centre of the city,under the current Place Maurice Mollard, between the town hall and the national baths. beside which, on a lower terrace to the west, the funerary Arch of Campanus was built and below a second terrace on which a temple of Diana was constructed in the second century.Part of the temple was incorporated into the national baths. Some remains are visible inside the basement. The Arch of Campanus in an etching by Borgonio in 1674 The arch was erected at the end of the 1st century by Lucius Pompeius Campanus, a patrician of Gallia Narbonensis, a rich notable Allobroge from the city of Vienne (to which Aquae was subordinate). Although the arch bears inscriptions in honour of the Campanus family (the monumental glorification of elites and their families was an innovation of this era), the function of the monument remains uncertain. It is thought to be a funerary arch, but is however a long way from the Roman cemetery and Roman religious custom would not permit interments within the city. On the other hand, the arch is placed in such a way as to offer a view in the direction of the thermae, and a walkway passed under it,Charles Despine (1834) et A. K√ºpper-B√∂hm, cited at General Inventory of the Heritage of Aixes: Arch of Campanus , by Jo√´l Lagrange et Marie-Reine Jaz√©- Charvolin. so the idea that the arch is a city gate is more probable. Further support for this derives from the fact that the thermae, the temple, and the arch are contemporary. Forgotten, the arch became the entrance to the courthouse in the 16th century and was later integrated into the wall of a stable, gradually buried, and finally rescued in 1821. It remained standing after the destruction in 1867 of a hotel that stood in the middle of the modern Place Maurice Mollard. = Construction = The arch is 9.15 metres high and 7.1 metres wide, but only 75 centimetres deep. Its limestone blocks are placed without mortar. Its single vault is a semicircular arch of 6 by 3.5 metres, under which there was a paved walkway. Above the two pylons is an entablature with an architrave and a frieze of eight niches which probably contained busts. On the west facade, the names of Lucius Pompeius Campanus' ancestors are engraved.

Rubinstein returned a week later, at the next show, with a photograph of himself with Michelle Pfeiffer. However, two days later it was revealed that he was photographed with a cardboard cut-out and not the real actress. It appeared he knew in advance what the challenge would be. In order to stand out in the audience and have Dudu Topaz select him, he wore a big hat. This incident was mentioned in the list of the greatest scandals and pranks in the history of Israeli entertainment at Ynet and Globes magazine. =\\"The Babies\\" Band= In 1998 Rubinstein founded \\"The Babies\\" Band along with Reuven Hayun.

On 1 January 2013, his second solo album was released. =Collaborations With Other Artists= In 2007 Rubinstein released a duet with the Israeli singer, Daphna Armony, named \\"Rak Ohev\\".

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence. Under Ottoman rule, up to \\"6,000 Greek clergymen, ca. 100 Bishops, and 11 Patriarchs knew the Ottoman sword\\".Christodoulos (Paraskevaides) of Athens.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821‚Äì28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

Garcia previously served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 2013 to 2015.  Early life and education Leroy Garcia grew up in Pueblo, Colorado where his parents owned a beauty salon. From 2001 to 2007, Garcia served in the United States Marine Corps and was deployed to Iraq as a mortuary affairs specialist during the Iraq war. Garcia obtained a degree in emergency medical services from Pueblo Community College, a bachelor's in management from the University of Phoenix and a master's degree in organizational management from Ashford University in Clinton, Iowa. Garcia is a former member of the Pueblo City council.  Colorado House of Representatives  Leroy Garcia was elected to represent the 46th District in 2012 Colorado House of Representatives elections. He defeated Republican candidate Jerry Denney by a 61-39 margin. = 2013 Legislative Session = In his first year in the Colorado General Assembly, Leroy Garcia sponsored a bill to turn the closed U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, sanatorium and prison Fort Lyon into a shelter targeted for homeless veterans. This bill was passed by the Colorado Legislature and later signed by Governor John Hickenlooper. Also in 2013, Garcia lobbied in Washington D.C. to support improved conservation and agricultural efficiency for the Colorado River. = 2014 Legislative Session = In 2014, Garcia advocated to preserve Amtrak's Southwest Chief's stops in Southern Colorado arguing that they are essential for the local economy. The Colorado Legislature passed a bill, sponsored by Garcia, that established a commission aimed at preserving the train service. The bill was later signed in to law by Governor Hickenlooper.  Colorado State Senate  Leroy Garcia was first elected to represent the 3rd district in 2014 Colorado State Senate elections. He defeated Republican incumbent George Rivera by a 55-45 margin. Rivera had held office since the recall election of Angela Giron on September 10, 2013. = 2015 Legislative Session = During the 2015 Session, his first in the State Senate, Garcia worked on bills concerning easing overseas voting requirements, Youth Offenders, funding for the Southwest Chief and the Judiciary. = 2016 Legislative Session = During the 2016 Legislative Session, Senator Garcia sponsored two bills that eventually passed the Legislature and where signed by the Governor. The two bills were SB69, concerning measures to provide community-based out-of- hospital medical services and SB134, concerning professional licensing for military veterans in certain professions. As the Colorado legislature was divided between Democrats and Republicans at the time, both bills needed and achieved significant bipartisan support, with SB134 being passed by unanimous consent in both the State House and the State Senate. = 2017 Legislative Sessions = During the 2017 Regular Session, Garcia worked on bills concerning veterans issues, health care, consumer rights and local issues like funding for the Southwest Chief and the promotion of the Runyon-Fountain lakes state wildlife area. = 2018 Legislative Session = During the 2018 Legislative Session, Senator Garcia sponsored three bills that eventually passed the Legislature and where signed by the Governor. The three bills were SB20, concerning mental health care professionals who are permitted to perform auricular acudetox, SB66, concerning an extension of the operation of the state lottery division beyond July 1, 2024 and SB158, concerning measures to increase school district access to interoperable communication technology to improve school safety. As the Colorado legislature was divided between Democrats and Republicans at the time, these bills needed and achieved significant bipartisan support. = 2019 Legislative Session = The 2018 Colorado State Senate Elections saw Democrats taking a 19-16 majority in the Colorado Senate, while Senator Garcia was reelected by a 74-26 margin against Libertarian candidate John Pickerill. This new majority enabled a Democratic government trifecta in Colorado State Government for the first time since the 2014 Legislative session. The Democratic caucus unanimously selected Senator Leroy Garcia as its leader. With the beginning of the 2019 Legislative Session, Leroy Garcia begun to serve as President of the Colorado Senate. During the 2019 Session, Garcia sponsored bills concerning Emergency Medical Service programs, tuition assistance programs, the Human Trafficking council, the Public Utilities Commission and Criminal justice reform. Senator Garcia voted no on HB1177, a so-called red flag gun control bill, citing the successful recall efforts of two State Senators after the Democratic majority passed gun-control bills during the 2013 Legislative Session in the wake of the Aurora shooting and lacking mental health considerations within the bill. Garcia, a member of the leadership of the Democratic Senate Caucus, was the only Senate Democrat voting against the measure as it passed the chamber on 18-17 vote. The measure, which was later signed in to law by Governor Jared Polis, enables Colorado judges to order the seizure of firearms when they consider the owner either a risk to others or themselves. = Recall efforts = In August, 2019, the Colorado Secretary of State approved the circulation of a recall petition against Garcia. The organizers of the recall had until October 18, 2019 to gather 13,506 signatures to put the recall question on the ballot. The recall petition stated that Garcia should be recalled because \\"Senator Leroy Garcia has voted against the best interest of his district by voting YES on SB 19181 which would restrict oil and gas production in Colorado. According to one of Pueblo county's largest employers, EVRAZ Rocky Mountain Steel, these restrictions will threaten jobs and tax revenue in Pueblo county. Senator Garcia has betrayed the trust of his constituents by blatantly refusing to carry out the desires of the overwhelming number of the people he was elected to represent when 60% of Pueblo county voted no to similar oil and gas restrictions in proposition 112. Leroy Garcia has cost taxpayers ten of thousands of dollars in legal fees from a lawsuit settlement, and put thousands more at risk from another lawsuit because he ignored legislative rules\\". Garcia has reacted to the recall efforts with an ad campaign for TV and Facebook touting his accomplishments and life story. Just prior to the deadline, the recall organizers submitted only four signatures, having failed to gather sufficient valid signatures to effect the recall. The organizers said they submitted only four signatures to protest the voter intimidation they experienced during the recall process. By turning in only a few signatures, the organizers left open the possibility of starting a second recall effort.

He is one of the five recipients of the Cross of Valour, Australia's highest bravery decoration, which was awarded for his actions in the rescue of a child from a flooded storm water drain in 1996. Cross of Valour events About mid morning on 3 May 1996, Sparkes, a detective senior constable with the New South Wales Police, rescued a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour. Sparkes and Detective Senior Constable Gavin Dengate responded to an urgent call for assistance to rescue a boy trapped in a flooded storm water drain. From the entrance of the drain, an object, believed to be the missing child, could be seen about 80‚Äì100 metres away. Tied to a rope, Sparkes entered the drain and was rapidly washed 20 metres along the pipe by the ferocity of the current before realising the rope was inadequate. With a more substantial line, he re-entered the drain even though breathing space in the pipe had been reduced by the rising flood waters and his own bulk displacement. Flood waters washed him some 80 metres downstream before he could establish that the object was only debris. The drain was now almost totally engulfed in flood water, leaving only a small air space, and Sparkes was in danger of drowning as frantic attempts were made by his colleague and others to haul him against the flow to the surface. Although believing the child had little or no chance of survival, screams were heard further downstream in a pipe under a section of the Pacific Highway at the junction of six drains. Believing that the child was drowning and had to be rescued by the fastest means possible, Sparkes and Dengate descended into the flooded pipe in total darkness without a life line, torch or emergency air supply. As it was impossible to call to the child above the roar of the flood water, the rescuers separately searched the maze of water pipes. After progressing deeper into the drainage system, Sparkes could hear the desperate screams more clearly and believed he had located the boy's position. It was agreed that Dengate would search at ground level for another manhole closer to the child to facilitate a faster rescue. An ambulance officer, Michael Marr, then descended into the drains and remained in the flooded junction area to assist Sparkes. Sparkes secured a rope to himself and, with the aid of a torch, crawled back up the flooded drain. Exhausted from his ordeal, Sparkes dragged himself against the flow, finally, making contact with the child and managing to calm him. At this stage Sparkes was 30 metres from the pipe opening and 3 metres underground. Sparkes managed to coax the boy into letting go of debris, and allow himself to be washed down the drain to where Sparkes could grab and secure him. Sparkes then placed the boy in front of himself and they were both washed down the pipe to the waiting ambulance officer. Sparkes suffered lacerations and abrasions to his back and shoulder and cuts to his fingers and feet from forcing his way against the flow. Throughout the rescue Sparkes was aware that he was in grave danger of losing his life as he believed that the whole of the storm water system was only minutes away from again being totally engulfed with flood water. Later career Sparks has been active in various community and social programs since the early 2000s. Among others, he is an ambassador for Beyondblue (since 2013) and the wounded serviceperson charity Soldier On (since 2014), and has also worked with suicide prevention initiatives, the Heart Foundation, and advisory and charitable organisations connected to New South Wales Police. Sparkes is also Vice Patron of the Australian Bravery Association and President of the Cross of Valour Association of Australia. Sparkes's story features as chapter three of the book Brave: Ordinary Australians and Their Extraordinary Acts of Courage, by Mark Whittaker. In 2013, Sparkes penned his autobiography, The Cost of Bravery, with help from Whittaker. In August 2016 Sparkes was awarded Australia's fourth highest bravery decoration, the Commendation for Brave Conduct, for saving the life of an Aboriginal man who had fallen onto the path of an oncoming train at Redfern railway station in April 2014. The Commendation was followed by the award, in January 2017, of a Medal of the Order of Australia for Sparkes' service to mental health support organisations and to the community.

They lured up to 19 people from P√°pa to Hamilton starting in 2008 and then used them for the purpose of unfree labour, forcing them to do construction work without paying them. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police issued approximately 60 charges against members of the organization.

J. P. Taylor. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Hamish Hamilton in July 1945. Origins In a review of G. P. Gooch's Studies in Diplomacy and Statecraft in 1942, Taylor wrote, \\"Gooch was a pupil of Acton and a Liberal member of the 1906 Parliament; in both capacities he was convinced of the civilised character of Germany and this influenced all his scholarship. Germany appeared to him a power like any other, with some faults, but more grievances\\".Burk, pp. 250-251. Taylor believed that by 1942 it was clear that it was not the case and that \\"the new generation of historians has now the obligation to make a new analysis of the underlying forces in Europe which will be closer to reality and so prepare a British policy which will suffer from fewer illusions and make fewer mistakes\\".Burk, p. 251. Content The book was published two months after the Second World War with Germany had ended. In the introduction, Taylor wrote the book was a pi√®ce d'occasion and claimed that it was serious history but that but for the war it would not have been written. He argued: \\"The history of the Germans is a history of extremes. It contains everything except moderation, and in the course of a thousand years the Germans have experienced everything except normality\\". The \\"German problem\\" in Taylor's view had two sides: how can Europe be protected against repeated German aggression, and how can the Germans secure a peaceful form of political existence?Burk, p. 251. Taylor also noted the repeated failure of the German left to choose a democratic Germany when the choice was between democracy and unity. In his discussion of the revolutions of 1848, Taylor noted: > 1848 was the decisive year of German, and so of European, history: it > recapitulated Germany's past and inspired Germany's future.... Never has > there been a revolution so inspired by a limitless faith in the power of > ideas: never has a revolution so discredited the power of ideas in its > result. The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the > failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing > remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German > history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people > stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once > more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was > the fateful essence of 1848.Burk, p. 252. Taylor criticised all of the main parties in the Weimar Republic. The Social Democrats, \\"instead of placing the blame for defeat on the old order... they helped the old order back into power and bore the burden of its disaster\\". The Communists failed to live up to their revolutionary rhetoric: \\"When, in 1933, the moment came for the Communists to undertake the battle in the streets to which they had so often appealed, it turned out that they were old-style parliamentary talkers like all the rest\\". Taylor views that the Centre Party was so used to exacting concessions from the government to protect the Catholic Church that they had no power to oppose.Burk, p. 252. He also attacked the Weimar statesman Gustav Stresemann, who had a reputation in the West for being a \\"good German\\": \\"Even at the moment of the signing of the Treaty of Locarno, which recognised the Franco-German frontier, he declared... that his main purpose in signing was to secure revision of Germany's frontiers to the east. Stresemann agreed with the most extreme Pan-German in striving for German supremacy in Europe and beyond; where he differed from the Pan- Germans was in believing that this supremacy could not be won by military power, but must be achieved by the weight of German industry and the preponderance of German organizing power\\".Burk, pp. 252-253. Reception The book was a success with the public and sold over 6000 copies in the first few months. It received mixed reviews, however. Lewis Namier reviewed it in the Times Literary Supplement. Namier approved of Taylor's thesis but criticised his style: \\"His combination of ruggedness and impressionable vivacity renders him also impatient of the careful labour of perfecting and polishing - he discovers precious stones by the handful, and puts them half-cut into circulation.... The basic ideas of Mr. Taylor's book are sound, but would have profited by further careful examination and unfolding... the book should prove of high value in the study of the German problem\\".Burk, p. 253. In the journal International Affairs, the reviewer praised the book until 1919 but criticised Taylor's chapters on the interwar years: \\"It is too facile an attempt to discover some continuity in German history which can compare Charlemagne with Hitler\\" in their attempts to unite Europe. The reviewer also claimed: \\"In the effort to make the Nazis, not in large measure the result of this anarchy [the economic crisis], but a normal development, quite to be expected, of German history, Mr. Taylor nearly succeeds in making them respectable.\\"Burk, pp. 253-254. The American Historical Review remarked: \\"The profound is mixed with the wisecrack. It has the shortcomings of its virtue. It will shock the scholarly reader but it must challenge him too.... A returning American scholar reports that it challenges equally German historians, some of whom admit that it will make them rethink their modern national history\\".Burk, p. 254. The German conservative historian Gerhard Ritter was outraged by the book and wrote to Gooch that during the Third Reich: \\"German scholars had been ashamed and boiled inwardly at the nonsense written about England, and that no academic historian - as far as I know - had participated. I am correspondingly dismayed and alarmed that even in Oxford, informed history should be displaced in such a high measure by politically motivated history\\". Gooch replied that Taylor was the only really anti-German British historian and was not to be taken too seriously.Burk, p. 254.

FLEVO stands for Facility for Liquid Experimentation and Verification in Orbit. Multiple sensors were used to monitor the behavior of water in an instrumented tank and how sloshing affects the attitude control of launchers and space vehicles. The project is a joint program between ESA, the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes, and the Israel Space Agency. The primary contractor is the National Aerospace Laboratory providing the spacecraft structure and power systems. The ejection system and ground support equipment were contracted by NEWTEC. The ISA was responsible for supplying the sub-propulsion system which was built and assembled by Rafael. Spacecraft The spacecraft itself is a 90-cm cube microsatellite covered by solar cells and fitted with 12 small thrusters. Launch Originally Sloshsat-FLEVO was to be launched from the Space Shuttle and use the shuttle as a data relay, but after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster the satellite was modified to be launched on board the Ariane-5 qualification flight. The satellite was launched from the Guiana Space Centre launch site at Kourou, French Guiana on 12 February 2005. Experiment The SLOSHSAT-FLEVO is the first satellite entirely dedicated to liquid research in space. The satellite was equipped with an 87-litre cylindrical tank containing 33.5 litres of de-ionised water. 270 sensors were placed on the tank's walls to measure the sloshing behavior by calculating the thickness of the water. Three accelerometers and a fibre- optic gyroscope were used to measure the motion of the spacecraft. An array of temperature, pressure and fluid velocity sensors were also installed on the craft. After depletion of the propellants and completion of the experiment, the satellite was turned off. The satellite had a lifetime of around 14 days. ESA estimate that without active debris removal the orbit would decay by 2335.

It is the first novel of the Fire and Thorns trilogy, followed by The Crown of Embers (2012) and The Bitter Kingdom (2013). Plot The Princess of Orovalle, Lucero-Elisa de Riqueza, was born as the chosen one, selected by God to fulfill a prophecy shown by a blue gem in her navel called the Godstone. Lucero-Elisa lacks confidence in herself, and often eats out of unhappiness; she is described as \\"fat\\" in the novel. On her sixteenth birthday, Lucero-Elisa is married to King Alejandro de Vega of Joya d'Arena, a country soon to be at war with Invierne. While traveling to Joya d'Arena, Elisa's caravan is attacked. Elisa, who has studied military history, provides sound military advice about the conflict, rescues herself and her companions, and saves the king's life, but her companion Aneaxi dies of injuries sustained in the attack, leaving her with one ally, her nurse and bodyguard, Ximena. When they arrive at Alejandro's palace, the King announces Elisa as princess and special guest, but conceals his marriage, and her Godstone. For some weeks, Elisa lives at the Palace as a \\"guest\\", making connections with the local priest, Alejandro's friend, and Alejandro's son, Prince Rosario. She is also forced to contend with a rival, Condesa Ari√±a, the king's mistress, and Ari√±a's maid, Cosm√©. While at court, Elisa is asked to advise the king's Council about war, as well as to keep watch on his court. Elisa comes to learn that she was raised by a religious sect that believed in keeping her ignorant about her Godstone. Cosm√© accidentally discovers Elisa's identity as bearer of the Godstone, and arranges for her to be kidnapped. They travel for a month across the desert, facing harsh conditions, and Elisa is pleased to have lost weight and have more physical endurance. When they arrive at their destination, Elisa is informed that the war has been under way for many years, and that Alejandro is a \\"weak king,\\" who has not been willing to protect the desert villagers. She also learns that her kidnappers believe that her Godstone will be able to use sorcery to battle the powerful sorcerers of Invierne, the animagi. Elisa sees that the people of Joya are unprepared for war. To learn more of the army of Invierne, she, Cosm√©, Humberto, and two others go to observe them from a cave hideout. The Invierno army decides to investigate the cave one day and the group flees, leaving Elisa hidden behind because she will only slow them down. Elisa is captured, and taken to an Animagi who wears a Godstone around his neck. She plays dumb and tricks him into sipping a drug to knock him out. She dons his robes and Godstone pendant and escapes, burning the Animagi in his tent. Elisa finds Humberto using her Godstone, and he nurses her back to health. Later, a message states that the Conde Trevi√±o, the father of Condesa Ari√±a, wishes to discuss an alliance with the Malficio, the group Elisa has created to conquer the Invierne. They travel to his village only to discover he has allied with the Invierne. He demands Elisa tell him where the camp is, while everyone else is held captive in his home. When Elisa refuses to give information, he kills Humberto and throws Elisa in the cell with the rest of her party. King Alejandro's men show up and break Elisa and the rest out of the cell. They escort them back to King Alejandro's palace, where Elisa is re- introduced to the king as the leader of the Malficio. The King is shocked to discover it is her, and finally announces that she is queen. At the palace, Elisa discovers her potted plant with the Godstones is missing from her room. She asks Prince Rosario to locate them for her. Days later, the army of Invierne marches in against Joya d'Arena. Elisa receives a message from Cosm√© that five animagi are headed towards the palace escorted by the Invierne army. The army breaks through the palace's defenses and kills Condesa Ari√±a and severely injures the King. Elisa's nurses quickly plan to flee with Elisa and the Prince, but the animagi break in. Elisa steps up as the bearer of the Godstone to save her nurses, and, getting the Godstones from Prince Rosario, which he found in Ari√±a's room, places all four plus her own into the pendant she stole from the first animagus she encountered. This sets off an explosion that destroys all the animagi. The King dies from his wounds, and Elisa becomes queen of Joya. She is prepared for the tasks to come that God has set out for her.

The celebration begins in the morning of May first every year and continues into the next day. Lei day was established as a holiday in 1929. Each Hawaiian island has a different type of lei for its people to wear in the celebration. The festivities have consistently grown each year and the state of Hawaii has changed the location of the event. Lei day was first held in the Courts and Town Halls but has since been moved to Kapi'olani park. History =About the islands= Each island in Hawaii has a special flower that represents that island. The island of Hawaii, more commonly known as The Big Island, has the red blossom of the Ohia tree, called the lehua blossom, for its flower. The island of Maui's flower is called the Lokelani and is pink. The island of Oahu's flower is called the Ilima. The Ilima's color is golden and can be seen all across the island. Molokai uses the flower of the Kukui tree which is green. Lanai has a grassy flower called Kauna'o, which is yellow. Hinahina, the flower of the island of Kahoolawe, has a silver-gray color across the top. Kauai has mokihana flowers with a green color. The island of Niihau's \\"flower\\" is actually shells called Pupu. =Becoming official= In 1929 Lei Day was officially recognized as a holiday. However, the first celebration of this event was in the year of 1927. The first celebration was held at the Bank of Hawaii, then moved to town hall, and finally moved to Kapi'olani park. In 1928 writer Don Blanding wrote an article in the local newspaper stating that there should be a holiday celebrated around the wearing and production of leis. =When it is celebrated= Traditionally held on May 1 beginning at 9:00 a.m. The event lasts all through the day and ends at 5:30 p.m. A Lei Contest is held May 2. It was writer Grace Tower Warren who finally suggested that Lei Day be celebrated on May 1, in conjunction with May Day. She was credited with saying, \\"May day is Lei day\\". =Differences in lei= Leis (2) Each island of Hawaii has a specific Lei which makes great variety in the leis being produced from each part of Hawaii. The island of Kauai's lei is actually a type of fruit. These purple berries are strung around and leave a blossoming smell that can only be found on this island. Kahoolawe's is called hinahina and this is found on the beaches of Kahoolawe, the stems and flowers of this plant are twisted together to be formed. The island of Lanai has a kaunaoa Lei. The light orange thin strands of vine are gathered in groups and twisted together. The island of Maui houses the lokelani Lei. Its color is pink and is sweet scented and very fragile. Molokai is home to the kukui. The leaves are mostly silver green and combined together to be made into a lei. Niihau is a smaller island, but is very plentiful of pupu. White pupu shells have to be pierced with small holes to be strung into a lei. Oahu has the \`Ilima flower. This yellow lei is very thin and even more fragile. This specific lei is often called the \\"Royal lei\\" because in the past it was worn by high chieftains. Culture Lei Day is a celebration of Hawaiian culture, or the aloha spirit. People commonly celebrate by giving gifts of leis to one another. Schools also put on playshttp://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/May/02/ln/FP605020335.html and elect a Lei Day court of Kings and Queens to represent the different islands.http://www.polynesia.com/may_day.html Each island has its own symbol that is composed of a color and a flower. Hawaii (the big island) is red, Maui is pink, Oahu is yellow, Molokai is green, Lanai is orange, Kahoolawe is gray, Kauai is purple, and Niihau is white. In the same order the flowers are lehua, lokelani, 'ilima, kukui, kauna'oa, hinahina, mokihana, and a pupu shell. Niihau is the only island without a plant as its symbol.http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/May/02/ln/FP605020335.html Integration of cultures Lei Day in Hawaii incorporates various ethnic traditions, other than their own. Throughout the history of the holiday, natives have struggled between preserving Hawaiian culture and integrating foreign traditions on the special day. This has brought tension to the day of celebration, but over the years has meshed into part of the festivities. Although many different ethnic groups such as the Scottish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Korean and Filipino, have settled on the Hawaiian Islands, the dominant integration is of American and European cultures. The music and dance performed during the May 1st celebration is described as hapa haole, or part Caucasian. Songs like \\"Little Grass Shack\\" and moves that fuse in Euro- American styles are a quite common. In elementary school performances, a typical program will have the kids sing the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", while dressed up in military uniforms. Other performances may include something like a choreographed dances using a European maypole with streamers, having a Hawaiian theme or symbol behind it. Similar to an American high school homecoming or prom court, Hawaiian high schools announce the king, queen and their royal entourage for the day. During the Second Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s, the assimilated American‚ÄìHawaiian style was frowned upon, but today it is often accepted as a part of the island‚Äôs history. On the other hand, some have seen the assimilation as a loss of cultural identity and life for the Hawaiians, believing that the younger generations will completely lose their ethnic values. Lei Day, being traditionally diverse, attracts people from all around, to experience the day. Many natives claim that everyone wants to have and be a part of Hawaii. This day invokes the Hawaiian pride and lifestyle in those that have settled there, as well as those that come to visit. Lei Day has become a source of revenue, as it attracts many tourists who are interested in the traditional hula dances and lei ceremonies. Some have even described Lei Day as a tool to lure in people and get them hooked on the cultural life, leading them to permanently live in Hawaii and mesh themselves into the lifestyle. Symbolism of the lei The importance of the lei to the Hawaiian culture is that it is meant to represent the unspoken expression of aloha. The meaning of aloha can be interpreted in various ways. Depending on the occasion it can stand for farewell, greeting, love, hope, or joy. These are only a few meanings, as there are no restrictions to the symbolic meaning they hold. The idea is that although the lei lasts only a while, the thought lasts forever. This tradition is spread throughout the major islands on Lei Day. Each island has their own way of celebrating the holiday, as well as a different native vegetation that makes up the lei. Along with different techniques of assembling them. Other than the use of leis on Lei Day, they are incorporated in special occasions such as graduations, weddings and birthdays. The tradition was brought over by Polynesian voyagers sailing from Tahiti. In the past, maile leis, known as one of the most sacred leis, was used in peace agreements between opposing peoples. In addition to wearing the lei as a source of beautification, the lei was a way to distinguish groups of people from one another. The lei comes with a set of unspoken rules such as wearing it over your shoulders, not removing it while around the person that gave you the lei, and refusing a lei is seen as disrespectful. Over the years the lei has grown to become an accepted symbol of Hawaii that greets many visitors each year. Tradition The traditions of the ‚ÄúHawaiian Lei Day‚Äù are celebrated on many of the Hawaiian Islands. Parades and ceremonies, also festivals, are a major part of the Hawaiian Lei Day; also, numerous schools participate in the Hawaiian Lei Day festivities. ‚ÄúI can remember the joy of the annual Lei Day ceremony that permeated the campus of my elementary and middle schools while growing up on O ªahu. The entire student body would get involved: each class performed the hula for the entire school (we practiced for weeks beforehand)‚Ä¶‚Äù.Tutko 1 It is tradition that Hawaiian elementary and junior high schools encourage students to perform numerous Hawaiian dances for the entire school. For example, Barbers Point Elementary School incorporates the entire community with their annual performances; each grade level performs a different Hawaiian dance to a different song for various members of their community.About.com 1 Many of the Hawaiian Lei Day traditions are, also, practiced on set dates; should the set date of a tradition interfere with school and/or work, the set date of that tradition would be considered a holiday. Many Hawaiian educational facilities organize various festivities, such as hula dances, Hawaiian feasts, and a ‚ÄúHawaiian Lei Day ‚ÄúQueen‚Äù ceremony. In Hawaii, it is a remarkable honor to be crowned ‚ÄúLei Day Queen‚Äù; there are pageants, having similarities of the Miss America Beauty Pageant, that determine which young woman would be crowned Lei Day Queen. However, the most important Hawaiian Lei Day ceremony takes place in Oahu at Kapi ªolani Park.Tutko 1 Visitors are able to witness and partake in the numerous festivities that involve the beautiful Hawaiian leis. Many leis become a part of numerous contests: \\"As is tradition, the dozens of entries in the annual contest are placed at the Royal Mausoleum in Nuuanu the next morning‚Ä¶\\".Fischer 1 The Hawaiian Lei Day Queen determines which lei would win the contest. Many of the traditional contests of the Hawaiian Lei Day are centered on the craftiness and intricacy of leis; some of the ‚Äúwinning leis‚Äù are put on display until the next annual contest. In Honolulu, there are many different festivities that are centered on the Hawaiian lei. For example, one of the festivities includes the sharing of lei crafting techniques by Islanders.Watson 1 Also, there are many lectures given by Islanders about the symbolism and cultural meaning of the Hawaiian lei. For example, Islanders demonstrate that a lei that is received in a certain manner translates into a particular meaning: a greeting, a fare-well, a marriage, a celebration, etc. The color of the lei, also, represents certain translations; different leis should be worn for different occasions. There are also lectures about the history of Hawaiian Lei Day and of the lei. Honolulu, also, holds a Hawaiian Lei Day Queen pageant and many lei crafting contests; many entertainers also make appearances for the Lei Day celebration in Honolulu. On Hawaii Island, the\\"Big Island\\" of Hawaii, the annual Hilo Lei Day Festival features live music, Hula dancing, and crafty demonstrations. Also, ‚Äúspecial guests‚Äù make appearances at numerous festivities; many of the \\"special guests\\" are \\"guest speakers\\" that speak to audiences about the customs and traditions that are centered on the Hawaiian lei. There are, also, many festivities that are centered on Hawaiian culture, such as many various cultural dances, food, and shopping. Many festivals, also, feature numerous types of entertainers: local Hawaiian musical groups and local DJs, Hula dancers, etc. Much larger Hawaiian Lei Day festivals, of course, have a much wider venue of entertainers and activities that locals could choose from.

He also thanked his wife. As he was introducing Juan Antonio Samaranch, he noted that this would be his last Olympics as President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and would be a special night for him, although his experience of the games came amid personal tragedy. Juan Antonio Samaranch gave a speech echoing Knight's thanks to all those who helped organised the games, and calling the Sydney Olympic Games the \\"Best Games Ever\\". He then awarded the on behalf of the IOC, the Gold Olympic Order to both Michael Knight, as an expression of gratitude for a perfect organisation, and John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee for fulfilling the promise of making these games the athletes games. In addition, he also gave on behalf of the IOC, the Olympic Cup to the people of Sydney for their enthusiastic and unpartisan support of athletes from all countries. Samaranch then announced the newly elected members of the International Olympic Committee Athletes' Commission: *Sergei Bubka (athletics, Ukraine) *Charmaine Crooks (athletics, Canada) *Bob Ctvrtlik (volleyball, United States of America) *Manuel Estiarte (water polo, Spain) *Susan O'Neill (swimming, Australia) *Alexander Popov (swimming, Russian Federation) *Jan ≈Ωelezn√Ω (athletics, Czech Republic) *Roland Baar (rowing, Germany). ='Welcome Home, Olympics: Athens 2004'= Dimitris Avramopoulos, Mayor of Athens and Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games Committee entered the stadium.

It was the largest fireworks display staged in the world at that time, and required the work of five different pyrotechnic companies. Soundtrack: * Olympic Fireworks - David Stanhope * Overture to Tannh√§user - Richard Wagner * Arrivals: Movements I to V - Pee Wee Ferris * Symphony Of A Thousand - Gustav Mahler Legacy A major theme in the Sydney Olympic ceremonies was of reconciliation between Australia and the Australian Indigenous nations. In the years leading up to the Olympics, there was much discussion over what reconciliation would look like and was becoming a central social and political issue. In the Media Guide, the author notes that 4 months earlier, 250,000 Australians of all backgrounds walked across Sydney Harbour Bridge as support for recognition of past wrongs towards the First Nations peoples. It was shown in the closing ceremonies with a Anu's performance of \\"My Island Home\\", and on the performance outfits of both Midnight Oil's and Savage Garden's band members which had the word \\"Sorry\\" and Indigenous flag clothing.

She graduated from Newtown National School, Convent of Mercy Secondary School, and Ballinasloe Technical School. In 1961 she moved to England to pursue a career in nursing. She graduated from the Mayday Hospital School of Nursing in Surrey in 1964. In the early 1960s she met Bertram Gay in London. The couple later married and in 1968 they immigrated to the United States because their child needed a surgery that was only available Boston Children's Hospital. They settled in Somerville and the couple soon found employment, with Gay getting hired at Somerville's Heritage Hospital. She continued to work as a nurse until 1999. Political career In 1986, Kelly Gay was appointed to the Somerville School Committee. She was elected to a full term ten months later. In 1992 Gay was elected to the Massachusetts Governor's Council in the 6th District.In 1998 she ran for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.

Originating in a broad low pressure area that formed northwest of Australia by 8 March, the storm was plagued by inhibiting wind shear for the duration of its formative stages. However, it gradually organised, and received the name Lua on 13 March. The cyclone meandered for the first several days of its existence, caught between weak and competing steering currents. After the cyclone drifted northwestward, a building ridge of high pressure to the north drove Lua southeastward toward the Pilbara region. Ultimately intensifying into an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone with maximum sustained 10-minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), Lua made landfall near the remote community of Pardoo, about 150 km (95 mi) east of Port Hedland. It steadily weakened as it progressed south over interior Western Australia, diminishing below tropical cyclone status on 18 March. The threat of the impending cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron ore mining and exporting. The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important iron ore shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments. Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and iron ore exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. Overall, Lua is attributed to $217 million (2012 AUD; $230 million 2012 USD) in lost revenue. Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited by the lack of population in the storm's path. The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. Meteorological history Cyclone Lua originated in a broad area of disturbed weather that was spawned by a deep trough of low pressure and enhanced by a Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation pulse. The precursor to Lua was first identified through satellite imagery by 8 March 2012, while situated about to the north-northwest of Learmonth. Analysis of the disturbance revealed a diffuse low-level centre of circulation loosely bounded by sporadic, but multiplying, convection. On 9 March, the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Perth recognised the developing system and remarked on the potential for tropical cyclone formation over the following several days. The low pressure area meandered for several days, making some progress toward the east, and gradually consolidated. By 12 March, the system had developed persistent deep convection over the eastern half of its core and organised banding features elsewhere. Moderate vertical wind shear initially hampered intensification, though the BoM designated the system Tropical Low 16U; at the time, it was centred roughly northwest of Karratha, Western Australia. At 2300 UTC on 12 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. With increasingly favourable environmental conditions‚Äîincluding warm ocean waters and dwindling wind shear‚Äîthe low organised significantly between 12 and 13 March, and at 0600 UTC on the 13th, TCWC Perth upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Lua. Simultaneously, the JTWC issued its first tropical cyclone warning on 17S. Contrary to real-time operations, the official BoM \\"best track\\" database does not list the storm as having attained Category 1 tropical cyclone intensity until 0000 UTC on 14 March. At the time of its designation, Lua was nearly stationary in terms of forward movement, caught in the equilibrium between a blocking ridge to the southwest and increasing monsoonal winds from the northwest. The ridge began to drive Lua north-northwestward at up to , before the storm resumed its slow pace on 14 March. The storm remained relatively disorganised, its strengthening limited by moderate wind shear and dry air entering its centre. Consequently, a large void of thunderstorm activity created a \\"horseshoe pattern\\". Nonetheless, Lua proved resilient, and good outflow helped compensate for the adverse shear. The southwesterly steering currents weakened, causing the storm to begin its anticipated curve toward the east and east-southeast. According to the JTWC, the storm completed a small loop as a result of competing steering factors. At the same time, the upper levels of the atmosphere became far more conducive to the cyclone's intensification, and the storm's banding pattern tightened. With a building ridge to its north, Lua accelerated east-southeastward on 15 March, and with wind shear oscillating but generally decreasing, the storm became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 1800 UTC. Continuing to intensify, Lua began to exhibit an ill-defined eye on visible satellite imagery on 16 March. The storm was expansive, producing storm-force winds in a circular area across. Still, the deepest convection and most favourable outflow was focused away from the eastern semicircle due to persistent light easterly wind shear. The storm's structure improved throughout the day and into the night, and at 1800 UTC on 16 March, the storm attained its peak 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), classifying it as an upper-end Category 3 severe tropical cyclone. Early on 17 March, the storm turned due south toward the Pilbara coast, and the JTWC reported that Lua's peak strength was marked by 1-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), at 0600 UTC. At its deepest, the storm possessed a central barometric pressure of 935 hPa (27.61 inHg). Lua made landfall near Pardoo, about 150 km (95 mi) east-northeast of Port Hedland, at 0700 UTC while still at peak intensity. The cyclone steadily weakened as it progressed southward, tracking directly over the Yarrie mine before passing about halfway between Newman and Jigalong. With little extant convection and a shallow, exposed centre, Lua deteriorated below tropical cyclone status early on 18 March near Wiluna. The cyclone's remnants later entered the Goldfields- Esperance region. Preparations and economic impact Tropical Low 16U meandering off the Australian coast on 13 March The BoM hoisted its first Cyclone Watch on 14 March for coastal areas between Mardie Station and Cape Leveque. A Cyclone Warning was posted the next day for a smaller stretch of coastline within that range. As Lua approached the coastline, the Cyclone Warning was in place from Cape Leveque to Dampier. Communities between Bidyadanga and Port Hedland were under a Red Alert, the highest level of caution issued by the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia (FESA). The alert advised included residents to \\"go to shelter immediately\\". Localities elsewhere between Broome and Whim Creek were on Yellow Alert, while a Blue Alert was issued between Whim Creek and Dampier, to the west of the Yellow Alert area. Work at multiple oil fields and mining sites was suspended or slowed, with non-essential staff being removed at the sites remaining in operation. It was estimated that national oil production was reduced by about 25% during the storm's approach. Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an important iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by the morning of 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port out of the path of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, with little or no damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices up for a time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217 million (2012 AUD; $230 million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm. With the destruction wrought by Cyclone Laurence in 2009 still fresh in their minds, residents, business owners, and farmers worked hurriedly to prepare their properties and livestock for Lua's onslaught. Horizon Power temporarily redirected power supply in the towns of Marble Bar and Nullagine from solar power stations to diesel generator stations. Evacuation shelters were opened to refugees of the storm with no safe living arrangements starting 16 March. About 110 individuals sought shelter at one such location in Nullagine. As the storm moved inland, flood warnings were posted throughout the Kimberley and the Pilbara, where officials closed public access to Karijini National Park. The impending cyclone forced the closure of the Great Northern and North West Coast highways, while flights to and from several airports were cancelled. Meteorological effects and aftermath Microwave- enhanced satellite image of Lua at 0000 UTC on 17 March, at peak intensity; a well-defined centre is visible On coming ashore, Cyclona Lua produced strong winds, gusting to at Port Hedland, and appreciable rainfall, peaking at at Bidyadanga. The precipitation was widespread, affecting a large area of interior Western Australia. The overcast weather led to abnormally cool temperatures, which broke monthly records in portions of the central and eastern Pilbara. For instance, the Port Hedland Airport recorded a maximum temperature of 24.1 ¬∞C on 17 March, the coldest March day in the station's history; the previous record of 25.8 ¬∞C was set 64 years prior. As the remnants of Lua continued poleward, they continued to drop heavy rainfall, including a daily total (19 March) of at Edjudina, setting the record for the wettest March day there. A barometer reading of at Rowley Shoals represented the lowest observed pressure associated with the storm. Striking a relatively isolated area, the cyclone's effects were limited, and no fatalities or injuries were reported. Indeed, a FESA official noted that initial reports of damage were \\"scant\\". Preliminary assessments suggested that Pardoo Roadhouse and the small surrounding community bore the brunt of the storm, as most towns and farms in the region escaped relatively unscathed. The manager of the roadhouse relayed that the height of the storm was \\"absolutely horrific\\", downing numerous trees and causing some structural damage. Some destruction was also observed at the Yarrie Homestead, where return to normalcy was expected to take as long as 12 months. Numerous buildings on the Warrawagine Homestead sustained damage such as compromised roofs and doors, which amounted to an estimated $70,000 (2012 AUD; 74,000 2012 USD). Several head of cattle were killed by the storm. Moderate to major flooding took place in several areas, especially along the De Grey River drainage basin, though the rainfall proved beneficial in much of the climatologically dry area. The above-normal precipitation allowed farmers to get a head-start on planting winter crops. In the aftermath of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and small business owners would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm. The name Lua was later retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names due to the system's adverse effects on land and was replaced by the name Luana.

GLUFC's first-team began play in the North Atlantic Conference of the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) in 2014. The club left the NPSL and joined the Champions Soccer League USA (CSL USA) for the 2017 season. The team plays its home games on an artificial-turf field at historic Cawley Memorial Stadium, located in the Belvidere section of Lowell. In 2014, the NPSL team also played in Bedford and Lawrence, but Cawley is now the permanent home to GLUFC's top team. The junior team plays BSSL matches at Greater Lowell Technical High School.  History  Greater Lowell United FC was founded in 2013 as an expansion team to join the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) for the 2014 season. GLUFC also fielded two junior teams that season, one in the Massachusetts State Soccer League (MSSL) and one in the Bay State Soccer League (BSSL). The club dropped the MSSL team after the 2014 season but kept a team in the BSSL. In 2015, GLUFC's junior team was only competing in the second half of the 2015 BSSL season. GLUFC's top team played three seasons in the NPSL, a national amateur league that includes reserve teams from North American Soccer League (NASL) clubs. In 2014, the team won one game, drew one game and lost 10 games. GLUFC struggled early on under Coach Jason Moore, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) No. 1 draft pick, but rebounded under Coach Daniel Hristov, who replaced Moore after the second game of the season. Shortly after Hristov's arrival, the 2014 team beat the Rhode Island Reds, 2‚Äì0, in Bedford, and drew 0‚Äì0 with New York Athletic Club in Lawrence. However, Hristov and the club parted ways for the 2015 NPSL season, which saw Luis Costa arrive as head coach. Costa's sides performed well in several matches but failed to achieve results, losing 9 games and drawing one before Costa departed the club with two games left to play. Hayden Barbosa, an assistant coach at Daniel Webster College, coached the final two games, both of which were losses, including a 2‚Äì1 decision dropped to eventual undefeated NPSL champions New York Cosmos B in New York. Barbosa took over as coach of the NPSL team for the 2016 season. In 2015, goalkeeper Sam Manning earned a spot on the soccer team at Millersville University. In 2016, GLUFC left the NPSL, parting with its former co-owner and manager Andrea Gauntlett, who retained the right to field an NPSL team in the Greater Lowell area. GLUFC joined the CSL USA for the 2017 season. The club was placed in the league's North-East Division. Concurrent with the change of leagues, the club announced that Manny Andrade had become the team's sole owner.  Ownership  In the summer of 2013, Lowell locals Tim Melican and Manny Andrade founded GLUFC and began as co-owners of the club. In 2015, Melican left the club altogether and forfeited his ownership share. Andrade is now sole owner of the club. The club also has a board of directors made up of several residents of the Greater Lowell area.  Head coach  Hayden Barbosa will serve as head coach of GLUFC's National Premier Soccer League team in 2016.  Colors and crest  The club's home colors are black and green, while on the road the team wears green and white. The motto Magnus Viridis (Big Green) is prevalent on the club's coat of arms.

The history of Greece traditionally encompasses the study of the Greek people, the areas they ruled historically, as well as the territory now composing the modern state of Greece. Christianity was first brought to the geographical area corresponding to modern Greece by the Apostle Paul, although the church's apostolicity also rests upon St. Andrew who preached the gospel in Greece and suffered martyrdom in Patras, Titus, Paul's companion who preached the gospel in Crete where he became bishop, Philip who, according to the tradition, visited and preached in Athens, Luke the Evangelist who was martyred in Thebes, Lazarus of Bethany, Bishop of Kition in Cyprus, and John the Theologian who was exiled on the island of Patmos where he received the Revelation recorded in the last book of the New Testament. In addition, the Theotokos is regarded as having visited the Holy Mountain in 49 AD according to tradition. Thus Greece became the first European area to accept the gospel of Christ. Towards the end of the 2nd century the early apostolic bishoprics had developed into metropolitan sees in the most important cities. Such were the sees of Thessaloniki, Corinth, Nicopolis, Philippi and Athens.World Council of Churches: Church of Greece. Retrieved: 28 November 2013. By the 4th century almost the entire Balkan peninsula constituted the Exarchate of Illyricum which was under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Illyricum was assigned to the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople by the emperor in 732. From then on the Church in Greece remained under Constantinople till the fall of the Byzantine empire to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. As an integral part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the church remained under its jurisdiction until Greek independence. Under Ottoman rule, up to \\"6,000 Greek clergymen, ca. 100 Bishops, and 11 Patriarchs knew the Ottoman sword\\".Christodoulos (Paraskevaides) of Athens.

The Greek War of Independence of 1821‚Äì28 created an independent southern Greece, but created anomalies in ecclesiastical relations since the Ecumenical Patriarch remained under Ottoman tutelage, and in 1850 the Endemousa Synod in Constantinople declared the Church of Greece autocephalous. The cultural roots of both Byzantine and modern Greece cannot be separated from Orthodoxy. Therefore, it was natural that in all Greek Constitutions the Orthodox Church was accorded the status of the prevailing religion.Charalambos K.

Its solution is colourless below pH 8.2, and purple above 9.8. Its molecular formula is C22H18O4. It is used medically to determine calcium levels in the human body, or to synthesize polyamides or polyimides.  Production  o-Cresophthalein is not produced industrially, rather, it is commercially available. To be produced, the method generally used to synthesize phthalein dyes is effective. This method is used to synthesize phenolphthalein and thymolphthalein. To begin, a 2M equivalent of a phenol or a substituted phenol should be combined with a 1M equivalent of a phthalic anhydride. However, if the phenol is substituted, the carbon para to the hydroxyl carbon must not be substituted. Anhydrous methanesulfonic acid should be present as a condensing agent and a solvent that will dehydrate. The combined compounds should be mixed at 90¬∞C for 5 hours. The temperature should not reach 100¬∞C at any point. The mixture should then be cooled to room temperature and, once precipitated, added to ice water. The product should then be filtered, washed, and dried. The crude product should then be recrystallized with an appropriate solvent with charcoal treatment-furnished pure thalein dyes. The color after recrystallization should be between a light brown and a soft yellow.  Uses  The compound has uses ranging from medicine to laboratory syntheses of chemically similar compounds. o-Cresophthalein has been used to derive polyamides and polyimides, colorimetrically estimate calcium in serum, and predict amount of time to wait before blood collection after a patient receives gadodiamide. = Deriving Polyamides and Polyimides = Aromatic polyamides and polyamides are practical compounds due to their temperature resistance, electrical or insulating characteristics, and their mechanical strength. Some of the polyamides and polyimides that can be synthesized by o-Cresophthalein are polycarbonate, polyacrylate, and epoxy-resin. The diether-diamine 3,3-bis[4-(4-amino- phenoxy)-3-methylphenyl]phthalide, or BNMP, is synthesized by 12 g o-cresophthalein, 11.5 g p-chloronitrobenzene, 5.1 g anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 55 mL of DMF. The compounds should be refluxed together at 160¬∞C for eight hours. Once it is done and has cooled, it should be mixed with 0.3 L methanol. A precipitate should form and be vacuum filtered to obtain a solid. It should then be washed with water and dried, yielding a yellow product. It should then be recrystallized from glacial acetic acid to yield yellow needles. The product is BNMP. The reaction can go further by combining 15.5 g of BNMP with 0.18 g 10% Pd/C and 50 mL ethanol. They should be stirred at 80 ¬∞C. 7 mL of hydrazine monohydrate should be added drop by drop for one hour. The solution should then be mixed for eight hours. It should then be filtered to separated from the Pd/C and concentrated. The concentrated solution should be added to water, and a precipitate should be formed. It should then be vacuum filtered to isolate the solid, yelding 3,3-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)-3-methylphenyl]pthalide, or BAMP, as a white solid. It should then be purified by water and ethanol. = Colorimetric Estimation of Calcium in Serum = Calcium in a blood sample should be estimated when required medically. Calcium should be precipitated out of 0.1 mL of the blood sample serum as calcium oxalate. After that, the decomposition of the calcium oxalate should occur by heat. Then, the sample should be estimated colorimetrically by o-cresolphthalein complexone. The required liquid complexone is made by dissolving 10 mg o-cresolphthalein complexone in 50 mL alkaline borate, and then 50 mL of 0.05 N HCl are added to make the solution's pH 8.5. This method for calcium determination is efficient and effective, requiring a minimal amount of blood serum sample and a reasonable amount of time. = Determination of Impact of Gadodiamide on Calcium Measurements = Gadolinium is given to patients for magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI.It is used as a contrast agent for the exam to improve clarity of the images formed. However, it can react in the human body and have detrimental effects. Therefore, the agent should be removed. One of these gadolinium based agents is gadodiamide. Calcium in the body should be determined accurately to ensure that the Gadodiamide does not have adverse effects on the patient. There are two o-cresolphthalein methods to determine amount of calcium. The o-cresolpthalein methods are effective because it is a calcium binding dye. The gadodinium ion with a charge of +3 can be removed from gadodiamide using o-cresolphthalein. For these methods, glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, and time since gadodiamide was given should be recorded. Ultimately, these two factors and the impact of gadodiamide on calcium levels calculated by the o-cresolphthalein method helps to reveal an amount of time that patients must wait after receiving gadodiamide to have blood drawn again, or avoid pseudohypocalcemia.

Both the house and ruins were originally constructed in brick, a feature uncommon in the area during the time they were constructed. Ruins The ca1821 two-story brick shell house was built on a stone foundation and served not only as a house but also as the community post office and store. It was built by Tully F. Sullivan, the first postmaster at the location. The post office at the location was closed in 1848. After its closure as a post office, the building served as a detached kitchen and servant quarters for the main house. While the roof and floors were removed and a section of the second story wall collapsed, the chimneys and remaining walls of the building still stand. House The ca1839 two-story, load-bearing masonry building designed in the late Federal-early Greek Revival style, was built by Thaddeus Choice Bolling, a business partner of Tully F Sullivan, who was the last postmaster of the Tullyton post office. The house and property was purchased in 1859 by Reverend Clark B Stewart, who served as the minister of the nearby Fairview Presbyterian Church. The brick of the house was laid in a five-course American bond. All of the double-hung sash windows have stuccoed jack arch lintels. Both the north and south facades are identical. The interior design of the house is a central hall plan. The original woodwork, including a pegged mortice-and-tenon-joined staircase handrail, is intact. The house and property remained in the Stewart family until 1942. It then suffered a 40-year period of neglect until it was purchased by a local doctor who restored the home.

Deep convection in the Labrador Sea allows colder water to sink forming this water mass, which is a contributor to the upper layer of North Atlantic Deep Water. North Atlantic Deep Water flowing southward is integral to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.Shcmittner, Andreas, et al. \\"Introduction: The Ocean's Meridional Overturning Circulation\\" 2013 http://people.oregonstate.edu/~schmita2/pdf/S/schmittner07agu_intro.pdf The Labrador Sea experiences a net heat loss to the atmosphere annually.  Formation  Convection in the Labrador Sea is the result of a combination of cyclonic oceanographic circulation of the sea currents and cyclonic atmospheric forcing. At the southern tip of Greenland, water enters the West Greenland Current from the East Greenland Current, continues to flow northwest around the Baffin Bay, and then southeast into the Baffin Island Current continuing in the same direction in the Labrador Current. Sea ice in the winter months inhibits surface flow into Baffin Bay. The Labrador Current and the Western Greenland Current flow in opposite directions resulting in a cyclonic eddy. During winter months low pressure dominates in this region,Wallace, John M. and Peter V. Hobbs. Atmospheric Science An Introductory Survey. Academic Press, 2006, p. 17. and in years with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation deeper convection is observed.IPCC North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, Laabrador Sea and Nordic Seas 2007 http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch5s5-3-2-1.html  Spreading  Labrador Sea Water spreads through the North Atlantic Ocean by three routes: northeast directly into the Irminger Sea, into the eastern North Atlantic by means of the deep North Atlantic current, and meridionally via the Deep Western Boundary Current. Oceanographer Robert Pickart, in a paper published in 2002, presented data that suggest that the Labrador Sea is not the only formation site for Labrador Sea Water. They observed similar convective processes in the Irminger Sea and noted that transit times for Labrador Sea Water into Irminger Sea were unusually fast, suggesting that there is another source in the Irminger Sea.  Variability  Labrador Sea Water properties experience seasonal and interannual variations. In late spring and summer, large amounts of cold freshwater accumulate from melting ice and are mixed downward during convection. The source for heat in the Labrador Sea is modified North Atlantic Current water after circulating the subpolar gyre.Straneo, F. \\"Heat and Freshwater Transport through the Central Labrador Sea.\\" Journal of Physical Oceanography 36 (2005) In winter the sea becomes more saline as freshwater freezes to form sea ice. The greatest seasonal variability is largely confined to the surface waters, however an annual cycle of convective mixing and re-stratification is observed throughout the water column. Warming and increased salinity in the lower level and freshening at the surface is associated with re-stratification (May‚ÄìDecember), whereas a convective mixing period (January‚ÄìApril) leads to cooling and a decrease in salt content in intermediate and deep waters and an increase in salt content at the surface. Interannual variations in the intermediate Labrador Sea Water are due largely to changes in convection throughout these periods. Weak convective periods are associated with more heat in the water column and deep convective periods are characterized by cold water. In the early 1990s, several consecutive severe winters contributed towards deep convection in the Labrador Sea. These winters were also associated with strong positive fluctuations in the North Atlantic Oscillation. Labrador Sea Water became very cold, fresh, and dense during this period, and the layer extended to depths of 2300m in the spring of 1994. Due to weakened convection, Labrador Sea Water began warming significantly and increased in salinity over the following decade. This trend continued through 2010 and 2011 when weak convection was observed in relation with negative North Atlantic Oscillation. Deep convection was observed again in 2012 with the Labrador Sea Water reaching 1400m, corresponding with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation similar to those seen in the early 1990s.

She was the founder of Eish≈ç-ji temple in Kamakura and was also a concubine of Tokugawa Ieyasu. She was maybe from the ≈åta clan. Her other names are Ohachi no Kata („ÅäÂÖ´„ÅÆÊñπ) and Okatsu no Kata(„ÅäÂãù„ÅÆÊñπ).  Biography  Okaji no kata was of relatively unknown origin. She was either ≈åta Yasusuke's adopted daughter, T≈çyama Naokage's daughter, or Edo Shigemichi's daughter. There are also tales that say she shared a brother-sister relationship with D≈çkan. Various theories state that she could have been T≈çyama Tsunakage's daughter or younger sister. Many people believe that Ieyasu met Okaji around the time he first settled in Edo. Due to her status as his concubine, her age when they met is not recorded but some historians postulate that she could have been in her early teens. The two met due to her older brother reaching a higher status. She was admired by Tenkai, a Buddhist monk and political advisor from Ieyasu. He then recognized Okatsu's intelligence and recommended her to Ieyasu. Ieyasu was pleased with her charming wit and fell in love with her quickly. She was going to marry Matsudaira Masatsuna (Ieyasu's son) but the arrangement was cancelled after she became pregnant. Okaji's life is based on several tales and theories. It is said that she was loved by Ieyasu and his retainers. There is a story that says that Ieyasu spontaneously asked his subjects what was the most delicious food. While everyone present gave their own answers, Ieyasu turned to Okaji and asked for her answer. She quaintly said salt and, when pressed for why she chose it, responded, \\"It seasons the taste to any meal.\\" Ieyasu then asked what was the worst tasting food and she gave the same answer. Her explanation was \\"Because too much salt can simply ruin a meal.\\" Her answers pleased her audience and lightened the mood of their gathering. In 1607, she gave birth to Ieyasu's last son - she is the sixth daughter - when she was thirty. Ichihime was promptly engaged to Date Masamune's heir, Toragikumaru. Unfortunately, she died at the age of four after she ate some wild berries that poisoned her. Because of this incident, Ieyasu ordered that 8 years old Tsuruchiyomaru (È∂¥ÂçÉ‰ª£‰∏∏) who was Kageyama-dono (Oman no Kata)'s child being adopted by Okaji. Ieyasu sent one of his grandchildren, Toramatsu, to be adopted into the Date family and asked that Furihime (daughter of Ikeda Terumasa and Tokuhime) be his adoptive mother. Okaji was in low status, if she was killed or captured, it would not cause much turmoil in the Tokugawa clan, however, it is said that she served as an inspiration for Ieyasu. She accompanied Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara and the Siege of Osaka, dressed as a man she fought alongside other warriors. She was held hostage at Osaka castle, but escaped and returned to Ieyasu on horseback. After Ieyasu's death in 1616, Okaji became a nun with the Buddhist name Eish≈ç-in (Ëã±ÂãùÈô¢). She was the founder of Eish≈ç-ji temple in Kamakura, who was the ≈åta D≈çkan's residence. It is speculated that she was a proud supporter of Lady Kasuga, the wet nurse and political advisor of Tokugawa Iemitsu. After Ieyasu's death, there were few other noble women remaining in the Tokugawa clan, but there were still children who needed to be raised. Since swearing as a nun, she has gladly accepted Lady Kasuga. She was very courteous to her and quickly accepted her as part of the Tokugawa family. Okaji no Kata died at the age of 65 years. A few observers state that her ties to the Tokugawa family elongated her family's legacy until the Meiji Restoration took place.

It is meant to be an easier and more contemporary alternative to the ways governance has been executed in the past. Transactional governance E-Governance has many aspects, and \\"branches\\". One branch of e-governance is transactional governance which is used to carry out or conduct business activities, negotiations, and other activities and reach a conclusion or settlement between two parties. It has been loosely defined as anything that the citizens, in pursuit of its governance, that is conducted over a computer- mediated network. E-gov systems are intertwined with traditional public management information systems, which have been found to be quite different from anything in the private sector due to differences in design, purpose, use, organizational role, and assessment criteria. \\"Transactional Governance encompasses all forms of managerial governance, including selective incentives and monitoring capacity\\", according to the academic journal Effects of Transactional and Transformational Governance on Academic Teaching. Performance In this growing era of technology people have moved to more electronic ways of performing government tasks which is referred to as e-governance. In this transition to e-governance the main focus is to make sure that responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness is sustained at a high level. In order to sustain a high level of output (responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness) we are tuning our focus to developing a performance management system for efficient and effective service delivery, which continuously measures and monitors service response performance. The development of these management systems will improve public institutions and their service responses a great deal as well as making it much more accessible for the public to use to their advantage. Tony Bovair states \\"[c]learly, there are a number of difficult choices facing governments in deciding their priorities in e-government and e-governance. For example, increased efficiency might be gained if more communications could be made available only through telephone and internet connections. However, this could disadvantage those people without telephone or internet access. Again, e-governance mechanisms such as e-referenda Could improve the interactive participation of citizens and other stakeholders in government decision-making but it could also slow down decision making processes and could give rise to unrepresentative pressures being placed on governments and parliaments if security systems are not sufficiently watertight to eliminate bogus or multiple voting. In order to deal with this potential problem, governments will need to consider ways of setting priorities between the goals of e-government and e-governance. However, this will be problematic, both because the explicit setting of priorities is always difficult in a political setting and also because the goals of e-government and e-governance are so closely interrelated.\\" Citizen involvement Understanding the involvement and interaction between government and its citizens through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is crucial when discussing E-governance in the United States. Holden defines e-government as ‚Äúthe delivery of government services and information electronically 24 hours per day, seven days per week.‚Äù After the Internet boom and the implementation of governmental portals and websites during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, people in the United States now have the ability to access any number of programs online from e-voting and health care to tax returns and even accessing governmental data that was not previously available creating a more transparent and accountable face to the government. =Three models of interaction in e-government= According to Andrew Chadwick and Christopher May in their article, Interaction between States and Citizens in the Age of the Internet: ‚Äúe-Government‚Äù in the United States, Britain, and the European Union, there are three major models of interaction associated with e-government, the managerial, the consultative and the participatory. Although at any given time these models of interaction can stand alone as the ideal form of involvement between the parties, more often than not, they overlap and provide multiple forms of interaction. To begin, the managerial model stresses a vertical flow of information from the government to its citizens. This model is concerned with efficiency, especially with the increase in speed when delivering information and services, as well as a reduction of the costs. This model establishes a client type relationship between the government and its citizens. Second, the consultative model also stresses vertical information flow but is more concerned with responding to needs of societal interest as expressed electronically by the citizens. This includes online elections, and other input from voters and requires an enormous amount of citizen involvement. The participatory model is the final and most interactive of the three major models of involvement between government and citizens. Unlike the other two, the participatory model strives for horizontal and multi directional flow of information that creates a cyber society that can be more effective for the general public. This model becomes relevant when universal access and widespread usage of the technology have become part of the norm in terms of government-citizen interaction. Although these models show some potential ways for citizen and government interaction, there are many benefits and flaws with the actual implementation of e-government and how it can affect people involved in the political process in the United States. Benefits to citizen involvement There are many benefits associated with e-governance in the United States and the involvement of citizens in the process. To begin, due to e-governance relevant information is more readily available to the public, while governmental programs become less expensive and more efficient. This allows most citizens to become part of the political process without leaving the comfort of their home. This increases the number of people willing to be involved in democracy and voice their opinions due to the instant access to the government. Another benefit in citizen involvement in e-government is building trust between the citizens and the state. Over the past decades there has been a decline in citizens overall trust in the government. With such easy access to information, government programs and officials, e-government provides the perfect platform to start building the trust between these two parties. Potential issues with citizen involvement There are also a few potential issues with citizen involvement associated with e-government. Citizen involvement stems from problems with the actual technology used for e-governance and the potential that it will not always function as it is supposed to. A good example of this was the problems with the healthcare.gov website that was established to help citizens with healthcare information and enrollment during the Obama Administration. Since the technology initially did not consistently work, this limited the initial effectiveness of the program and ultimately made it more difficult instead of more efficient. The website has since been modified in the attempt to continue providing this healthcare e-governance service. Information dispersal and public engagement Information dispersal and public engagement are key to the success of e-governance. However, the process of successfully engaging the public is quite complex. Due to the wide range of internet advancements in recent years, the coordination of public engagement is difficult. Yet, the common desire to stay informed and find accessible methods to govern remains crucial. For example, the current Obama administration has been working to develop a more democratically engaged society. There has been much controversy over the administration's Affordable Care Act. With this piece of legislation, Healthcare.gov was created to provide a source for Americans to buy health insurance. Although this website has been unsuccessful thus far, it is a prime example of how the United States government can relay information as well as provide its services via the internet. Healthcare.gov is made to be a marketplace for healthcare insurance providers. The website offers groundwork for Americans to shop for coverage at lower costs or possibly find undeniable coverage. Depending on the success of the website, it may be one of the most effective, or at least most historic, government technological establishments in American history. Also see U.S. General Accounting Office, Customer Service: Human Capital Management at Selected Public and Private Call Centers, GAO Report GAO/ GGD-00-161 (Washington: August 2000). EGov prospective future The focus of technological implementation during each generation has faced a new and difficult sets of challenges. Previously Size and cost and function caused there to be a small focused use of computers. As computers became cost efficient and versatile there was difficulty dealing with the management of the new technology. Increasingly, privacy and security are becoming important issues. Since technology permeates our society and all of our lives are within the digital spectrum a whole new dimension of vulnerabilities is now needing to be addressed. Currently the focus majority of the government application has been the increase in efficiency and information and communication technologies. In the future this trend will continue. Recently increased emphasis has been placed in democratic engagement. As new technology is developed new rules and policies have to be crafted, and old policies adapted, each time adding another layer of complexity to integration and potentially mitigating benefits from embracing new technology. Many government agencies have struggled to adjust to the adoption of digital data. Other agencies struggle to control the flow of information such as security and police organizations not sharing information, and the controversial gathering of too much information. If e-governance in the United States is to advance the demand more sophisticated technological solutions for encryption, information sharing, and interactive communication will need to be addressed. Eventually E- government will just be government as the use of technology is the norm.

Every tungsten atom is covalently bonded to six selenium ligands in a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere while each selenium is bonded to three tungsten atoms in a pyramidal geometry. The tungsten‚Äìselenium bond has a length of 0.2526 nm, and the distance between selenium atoms is 0.334 nm. Layers stack together via van der Waals interactions. WSe2 is a very stable semiconductor in the group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides.  Structure and properties  The hexagonal (P63/mmc) polymorph 2H-WSe2 is isotypic with hexagonal MoS2. The two-dimensional lattice structure has W and Se arranged periodically in layers with hexagonal symmetry. Similar to graphite, van der Waals interactions hold the layers together, however the 2D-layers in WSe2 are not atomically thin. The large size of the W cation renders the lattice structure of WSe2 more sensitive to changes than MoS2. In addition to the typical semiconducting hexagonal structure, WSe2 exists in another polymorph, a metallic octahedral coordination phase 1T-WSe2 based on a tetragonal symmetry with one WSe2 layer per repeating unit. The 1T-WSe2 phase is less stable and transitions to the 2H-WSe2 phase. WSe2 can form a fullerene-like structure. Synthesis Heating thin films of tungsten under pressure from gaseous selenium and high temperatures (>800 K) using the sputter deposition technique leads to the films crystallizing in hexagonal structures with the correct stoichiometric ratio. :W + 2 Se ‚Üí WSe2  Potential applications  Atomic image of a WSe2 monolayer showing hexagonal symmetry and three-fold defects.

In ancient times they were inhabited by three powerful barons, who were all warriors, and combined together to keep the passes, that here lead in different directions into Switzerland, completely in their own hands. They would not suffer any persons, whatever might be their station, to pass without paying a toll, which they chose to levy on travellers and their goods, according to their own pleasure. They were, in fact, no better than leaders of banditti; for they spared no one, and their imposts were more particularly levied on the merchants, who brought their goods by this route from far distant lands. If any one offered remonstrance or resistance, he was imprisoned without hope of escape; and, that no person should elude their tyranny, they kept the gates in the walls they had raised at the foot of the rocks, across the narrow passes, constantly closed, so that by day or by night not a soul could pass without their permission.‚Äù  References  * Ruined castles in Switzerland ","title":"Blauenstein"},{"id":"41135451","text":"Molana Syed Abdul Khaliq Pirzada Al-Azhari (), born in 1950 in Kabirwala Shareef, Multan Shareef, Punjab Province, Pakistan, is a professor and member of the Senate of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

Reports of a collaboration between Silambarasan and Pandiraj first surfaced in the media during April 2013, and subsequently it was revealed that the pair would work on a romantic film to be produced by T. Rajender under Silambarasan's home production studio. Kuralarasan, Rajender's second son and Silambarasan's younger brother, was signed by Rajendar to make his debut as the film's music composer during July 2013. Pandiraj continued to work on the script throughout the middle of 2013. Comedians Soori and Santhanam were also revealed to be a part of the film, in an official press note, which confirmed that Balasubramaniem and Praveen K. L. would handle the cinematography and editing respectively. Aware that he and Silambarasan had different working styles, Pandiraj revealed that he told the actor that the film had to be completed within four months and Silambarasan was receptive of the idea. Silambarasan began filming his portions from October 2013 alongside Soori in Urapakkam, and worked on the film during the day before joining the team of Achcham Enbadhu Madamaiyada (2016) during the night time in the period. The first schedule was completed without a lead actress, and the second schedule was briefly delayed as Pandiraj weighed up his options on his casting decision. The film's cinematographer Balasubrameniem had discussed the film's plot with Udhayanidhi Stalin during the making of Idhu Kathirvelan Kadhal (2014), and Stalin had convinced the actress of that film, Nayantara, to meet Pandiraj. Subsequently, Nayantara signed on to be a part of the film during November 2013, agreeing to work with Silambarasan for the first time since their break-up, with the news creating increased hype around the project. The team shot at Sathyam Cinemas during late December 2013, with Pandiraj revealing that the film would feature several scenes depicting Silambarasan and Nayantara speaking through phone conversations. By the end of 2013, Pandiraj revealed that 40 percent of the film was completed and disclosed that the film was being developed under the title of Idhu Namma Aalu, but had no resemblance to the 1988 Bhagyaraj film of the same name. By April 2014, the film was seventy percent complete. Pandiraj began casting for a second lead actress during the middle of 2014 and held discussions with Bindu Madhavi and Taapsee Pannu, before finalising on Andrea Jeremiah. Actor Jai also shot for the film, and took part in a single day's shoot with Silambarasan, Nayanthara and Andrea. The project first ran into production troubles during July 2014, when Silambarasan had changed his hairstyle in between schedule breaks, leaving Pandiraj unhappy. Silambarasan subsequently disclosed to the media that Idhu Namma Aalu was his production and that others should not question his involvement in the project. Despite a brief tussle, the final schedule of the talkie portion began during August 2014. In December 2014, Pandiraj announced that the film, including post- production works, were complete and that he was waiting for the songs from Kuralarasan, in order to release the film by February 2015. In January 2015, Pandiraj tweeted about his annoyance at Kuralarasan's delay in providing the film's music and stated that a planned teaser scheduled for the month had to be delayed. The director and music composer later exchanged tweets blaming each other for the slow progress of the film. T. Rajendar also submitted a complaint to the Nadigar Sangam during September 2015 remarking that Nayantara was refusing to take part in the shoot of a song. Pandiraj came to her defence, arguing that Nayantara had wasted almost two years on the film due to the producers' poor organisation and was still yet to be paid for her work. He further stated that the song in question was an extra \\"kuthu\\" number that the script did not warrant and that Rajender, Kuralarasan and Silambarasan were unnecessarily interested in making sure that the song was included against Pandiraj's wishes. Silambarasan later shot the song with Adah Sharma during early March 2016, after the actress was given a further small character in the film.Adah Sharma to debut with Idhu Namma Aalu ‚Äì Chennai.

In this episode Emma Swan, her mother, and Regina Mills come face to face with Pan, while flashbacks show Regina adopting Henry. Plot =Opening Sequence= Pan's shadow hovers over the forest and swoops in front of the screen. =In the Characters' Past= =The Enchanted Forest= In the final hours before the curse is enacted, the jailed Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) reminds Regina (Lana Parrilla) that in 28 years, the Savior, who will be Emma Swan, still holds the power to overthrow her and break the curse. While Regina boasts that she has it all now, Rumplestiltskin warns her that she will return to him one day, seeking a remedy to fill the hole of emptiness in her heart. =In Storybrooke = Mayor Regina Mills begins to feel the emptiness in her position of power of controlling the town, and the only way to fill that void is to adopt a child, but she realizes that she'll have to wait a long time due to the possibility of being placed on a waiting list, so she (as predicted in the pre-curse) turns to Mr. Gold for help, but he then cautions her that when she becomes a parent, she should consider that she will be putting a child first. Days later, Regina learns that a baby has become available for adoption, so she travels to Boston to take custody of the child. The only warning the agency offers Regina is that the family has opted for a complete blackout concerning their lives (the sealed documents that Emma signed). Regina, convinced that she only needs the future, takes the newborn infant in her arms and names him after her father, Henry. Regina is starting to discover how difficult it is raising Henry, as the baby proves to be fussy and she's not able to soothe him. Unable to get any information from his past that she can give Dr. Whale after she takes Henry in for checkup, Regina calls in a few favors to get the identity of the birth mother accomplished through Sidney. The baby is uncooperative only for Regina, but when he is around Mary Margaret he calms down. Finally, Regina gets Henry to settle down at her home, only to learn from Sidney that Henry is the son of the Savior who will arrive in Storybrooke, prompting Regina to confront Gold at his pawn shop over this claim. However, Gold does not recall anything he told Regina due to the curse, or as he supposedly claims. So Regina decides to return to Boston with Henry and is ready to give him up to new parents. However, when she is left alone with him in the office, Regina decides that she needs him in her life and ends up taking him back home. Regina is unaware the other parents who were trying to adopt Henry had she went through with giving him up, were none other than John and Michael Darling, who were following Peter Pan's orders to take Henry back to Neverland. Having given careful thought, she now starts to worry about the future when Henry's natural birth mother will come to take him away from her because of a certain fate, Regina takes Henry and tells him a fairytale about a Queen who drinks a potion to remove the worries of her past, while Regina does just that. =In Neverland= As Emma, Neal, and Regina try to keep Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) alive after a brutal attack by Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) via a scar that was cut from Emma's sword, Regina tries to get Emma to understand that Henry may call them both ‚ÄòMom,‚Äô but Emma has more in her life to lean on, while Regina has only Henry. They realize that Pan will only be defeated if they all work together to hunt him down and kill him, a move that gives Emma an idea. As they return to Pan's camp, Emma tries to talk to the Lost Boys, convincing them that she will bring them all home to families if they cooperate. The Boys, convinced that Pan has betrayed them despite Felix‚Äôs protest, give in and tell Emma that Pan is in his Thinking Tree. As Neal takes charge of Henry, Hook takes the boys and prepares the Jolly Roger while the others go after Pan and retrieve Henry‚Äôs heart. At Pan‚Äôs Thinking Tree, Emma, Mary Margaret, and Regina see Pandora's box, and Regina suspects it's a trap as they find out that Gold is trapped inside. The ladies are then berated by Pan, who tells them that Gold is his son and afterwards are captured by a tree that feeds off of regrets (Emma for giving up Henry, Mary Margaret for giving up Emma), but Regina, whose love for her son outweighs any regret for the things she'd done that led to her getting him, manages to break free of the tree and grab Henry‚Äôs heart from Pan‚Äôs chest and the box holding Rumpelstiltskin. Regina then restores Henry‚Äôs heart just in the nick of time. As everyone makes it on board the Jolly Roger, Regina goes below deck and tucks Henry in, then casts a spell on his heart to protect it. Meanwhile up on deck, Gold is released from the box and reunites with Neal, who takes to calling him Papa and they embrace, as does Emma and her parents. However, after Regina left Henry in the room, Pan appears once more, this time with a knife, and apologizes for what is about to happen. He attempts to seize Henry's heart but Regina had enacted a spell to protect it. He is then caught by Gold after he went downstairs suspecting something wrong and discovers Pan trying to rip Henry‚Äôs shadow from him, prompting Gold to use payback at his father by capturing Pan in Pandora‚Äôs box. Neal unleashes the shadow and Regina captures him into the sail. The crew heads home to Storybrooke, with Wendy, The Lost Boys and Tinker Bell joining them. It appears that this story is far from over, because moments before Pan was captured, Henry and Pan shared a glimmer in their eyes. Henry later approaches Felix and tells him, ‚ÄúPan never fails,‚Äù indicating that Pan is indeed free and living in Henry‚Äôs body, and is ready to wreak vengeance on the Storybrooke residents, telling Felix (in Pan's own words), ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs play.‚Äù Reception =Ratings= The episode's ratings matched the previous outing, scoring a 1.9/5 among 18-49s with 6.60 million viewers tuning in, tying it as the lowest rated episode in the series so far.TV Ratings Sunday: 'Once Upon a Time' Stays at Low + 'Bob's Burgers' & 'American Dad' Fall from TV By The Numbers/Zap2it (December 2, 2013) =Critical reception= The episode was given highly positive reviews from critics, noting Regina's role and the episode's cliffhanger. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic a 4.7 out of 5, acclaiming the episode, saying \\"I really felt for Regina those first few days with baby Henry. As a parent, it's the worst feeling in the world when you feel as though you can't take care of your child.\\" She also called the cliffhanger in the episode \\"a complete shock.\\" Andrea Reiher of Zap2it also commented positively on Regina's role, saying \\"Nothing could have made me more sympathetic for Regina than watching her struggle as a single mom, worried that something's wrong with her baby (or herself) and wondering if she's a bad mother or that her baby hates her because he won't stop crying.\\" She also commented positively on the cliffhanger, saying \\"Loved the brief turn at the end of the episode of Jared Gilmore doing Henry-as-Pan. He's not a bad little actor and it should be fun to watch this play out.\\" Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode positive feedback, saying \\"On this post-Turkey Day weekend, let's all give thanks to \\"Save Henry\\" for finally getting us off the dark, dreary island of Never Land, tying up the first half of season 3 with a magical little bow... and then, in true Once fashion, reminding us once more that happy endings are never as uncomplicated as they seem.\\" In regard to the episode's cliffhanger, she said \\"I'm so glad that thanks to this last-minute switcheroo, the awesome Robbie Kay's Once arc hasn't yet drawn to a close.\\" Lily Sparks of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"What an amazing episode.

The Swartwout family lineage goes back to Groningen in the Dutch Republic. He enlisted in the Union Army in July 1861, serving with the 3rd New York Cavalry. Waffle iron and US patent Swartwout's letters patent The earliest waffle irons were not the work of Mr. Swartwout; instead, they originated in the Netherlands circa 14th century. They were typically made of two hinged iron plates connected to two long wooden handles, the plates often imprinted elaborate patterns on the waffles, coat of arms, landscapes, religious symbols, and the like. These irons were held over a hearth fire for baking. On August 24, 1869, Swartwout was awarded a US patent for an \\"Improvement in Waffle-Irons\\", consisting of a novel handle for opening, closing and turning a stovetop waffle iron. His invention looked nothing like modern electric models. Fashioned to sit on wood or gas stoves, the cast-iron plates were joined by a hinge that swiveled in a cast-iron collar.

It is often referred to as the Grzegorz Dorobek case after the first of 16 complainants whose grievances were accepted by the European Commission as grounds for the commission to bring the case against the Republic of Poland. It specifically deals with whether vehicles with a steering wheel on the right hand side (normal in countries where vehicles drive on the left hand side of the road) must be given a registration number by the authorities in Poland (a country where vehicles drive on the right hand side of the road). More generally it deals with the citizens' rights of free movement, which form the basis of the European Project. It also deals with the right of the European Commission to give instructions to member countries and the strength of grounds needed for member states to ignore the general rights and specific instructions.  Events leading to the case  In January 2008, Grzegorz returned to Poland from the UK with a right hand drive Vauxhall Vectra. He submitted an application for registration of the vehicle to the district office in Ko≈Ñskich. The vehicle registry refused, citing the decree of the Minister of Infrastructure dated 31 December 2002 on the technical conditions of vehicles and of the scope of the necessary equipment.  Court procedures in Poland  In March 2008 Grzegorz appealed to the Municipal Court of Appeal in Kielce basing his case on the law of the European Union. ‚ÄúMember States may not on grounds relating to the steering equipment: * refuse, in respect of a type of vehicle, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval, or * prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service of vehicles‚Äù As the Local Government Appeal Court upheld the decision, in February 2009 Grzegorz filed a case before the Regional Administrative Court against the decision of the Municipal Court of Appeals. In April 2009, the Regional Administrative Court in Kielce dismissed the case, judgment (file II SA / Ke 157/ 09) and upheld the decision of the Municipal Court of Appeals. In July 2009, Grzegorz took his case to the Supreme Administrative Court in Warsaw but in January 2010, the court dismissed the complaint (file I OSK 1148-1109). And so the administrative proceedings in Poland ended.  The case in the European Union  In October 2009, the European Commission sent a letter to the Government of the Republic of Poland regarding its breach of its obligations to comply with directives 70/311/EEC, 2007/46/EC and Article 28 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Polish government replied to the committee clarifying and reiterating its position on the registration of right hand drive vehicles. In September 2010, the European Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion on the matter to the Polish authorities . The letter indicated that the commission would wait two months for a remedy of the deficiencies in Polish law after which it would refer the matter to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. A year later, the European Commission referred the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. \\"The Commission considers that if a motor vehicle meets EU type-approval, it can be safe to drive in all Member States, irrespective of the adjustment to the right or left-hand traffic. The Commission believes that the obstacles in registering a car with the steering wheel on the right side violate the provisions of Directive 70/311/EEC, the Framework Directive 2007/46/EC and Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\\" On 8 June 2012 the President of the Court of Justice of the European Union granted leave to intervene to the Republic of Lithuania. On 7 November 2013 the Court of Justice of the European Union issued an opinion on C-639/11. The verdict delivered on 20 March 2014. The court decided that the Republic of Poland (also the Republic of Lithuania whose case was added) are breaking EU law by refusing to register right hand drive vehicles. The court refused to accept the Polish interpretation of the wording of European Union road vehicle regulations, also refused to accept the Polish argument that right hand drive vehicles would significantly affect road safety and found that the statistical analysis presented by the Polish Government did not meet the standards required for use in a court of law.  After the Judgement of the European Court of Justice  After the judgement of the European Court of Justice, Mr. Dorobek took his case to the Polish Supreme Administration Court. The court refused to reverse the decision of the lower courts on the grounds that the verdict of the European Court of Justice is case law which was not available to the lower court when they decided against him. The court did however allow some costs and opened the way for Mr Dorobek to recommence the process from square one. Initially the Polish Government gave indications to the Commission that they would comply with the court's judgement by the end of 2014. Having not complied, in February 2015 the Polish Government informed the Commission that it would not simply allow right hand drive vehicles to be dealt with in the same way as left hand drive vehicles; additional checks would be added to the annual roadworthiness tests. This led to a three-month standstill to allow the Commission and other EU National Governments time to object if they wished to. Once the period for challenges had passed the Polish Government published the new regulations on 2 July 2015. The additional checks define that the vehicle must have headlights which dip to the right, rear fog lights on the left side, an external mirror on the left side of the vehicle which allows a 2.5M field of view at a distance of 10M to the rear of the mirror and a speedometer in km/h (possibly in addition to mp/h) The ministerial order to allow registration of right hand drive vehicles was published on 31 July 2015. and came into operation 14 days later on 15 August 2015.

She is a news videographer, editor and live truck engineer for television stations, KCBS 2 and KCAL 9 in Los Angeles. Early life and education Laurie Fernandez was born in New York City, New York and grew up in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Fernandez holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mass Communications and Photography from the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. Career Fernandez began her television career at station WKBT in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where she was also the first female master control engineer. Shortly after, Fernandez moved to Los Angeles, California, to work at Telemundo's Spanish station KVEA 52, where her bilingual skills were put to good use. She was then hired at KCAL 9 in Los Angeles and later at CBS 2 when both stations merged, after CBS acquired KCAL 9 in 2002.KCAL-TV Fernandez started her career as a news videographer when it was traditionally a male- only field. Because of her gender, she had to overcome some obstacles and mindsets. People always seemed surprised to see a woman doing the job of cameraman. Her natural talent, along with her skills and abilities, helped her overcome these obstacles. Even today, being a woman news videographer is still a rarity, but more women are embracing it, as it has become more mainstream for women to be in this field and the equipment gets lighter thanks to technology. Fernandez has covered some of the major news stories in the Los Angeles area. The Rodney King Trial, The Los Angeles Riots, The Malibu Fires, The Northdridge earthquake, The O.J Simpson Trial, The North Hollywood Bank Shooting, and The Anaheim Police Shooting. Career highlights =Anaheim Police shooting= Laurie Fernandez's news video made world headlines when on July 21, 2012, while covering an officer-involved shooting in the city of Anaheim, California, a chaotic scene ensued. Anaheim police started shooting rubber bullets, pepper pellets, and a police k-9 dog was unleashed at a small crowd of people that included women, children and babies. Residents had gathered near the scene of the fatal shooting of 25 - year old Manuel Diaz, who was unarmed. Witnesses say that he was shot in the back, fell to his knees, and was then shot in the back of the head by Anaheim police officers. As angry residents took to the streets demanding answers from the police, they were met with pepper pellets and rubber bullets. CBS 2/KCAL 9 news videographer, Laurie Fernandez, was the only videographer to capture the chaotic and terrifying scene. This video is one of the most shocking and disturbing pieces of news video ever seen on television and on the internet. As the video aired and was replayed on the internet, it caused controversy in Anaheim and across the U.S. People compared the violence of this incident to the Rodney King story and the images of the Civil Rights Movement, where police dogs were let loose on demonstrators. The Anaheim Police Department received angry calls from people around the country and the world, and protestors showed up at the police station the following day. Daily demonstrations took place after this story aired, and on July 24, 2012, there was a riot with people demanding an investigation and justice. In their opinion, residents and those who watched the video, saw police using excessive force. The reaction to this story continues and has brought the Anaheim Police Department and the city under intense scrutiny. This story set in motion the following developments: An investigation by the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the California Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and the FBI, of the shooting and melee that followed, captured by Fernandez. A $50 million civil rights lawsuit filed by the family of Manuel Diaz against the Anaheim Police Department. A number of lawsuits filed by the people who were hurt by the Anaheim Police Department right after the officer- involved shooting. =Child abduction= In 2002, while covering a child abduction story, her video made national news again, when she captured the suspect's arrest. The child, Jessica Cortez, had been missing for weeks after being abducted from a park in Los Angeles. The child was safely returned to her parents. =Janitors Protest= In 1990 Fernandez shot video of a janitors protest in Los Angeles. When the protesters clashed with Los Angeles police officers, they were hit with police batons. A pregnant woman lost her baby, and many protesters were injured. The janitors had a Los Angeles city permit for the demonstration. Protesters who were injured used the news video, that aired during the news broadcast, to win their lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles.

First released on August 29, 2013 in Canada, it stars Annie Clark as a teenager who finds herself terrorized after she's left alone in the woods for a two night camp counselor initiation process. Of his inspiration for the film, Cravit mentioned that he was moved to create Solo after a friend of his told him a campfire story in which a girl looks through her summer camp photos to discover that an unknown person had taken pictures of her while she slept. Synopsis Gillian (Annie Clark) is a teenager who reluctantly takes a job as a camp counselor at a summer camp. Before she can take the job, Gillian is informed that she must prove her survival skills at a nearby island on the camp's property which is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a former camper. She's reassured that it's safe, but is put on edge when she comes across Ray (Daniel Kash), a local man who claims that Gillian had sent out a distress call. Her uneasiness grows until later that night, when her seemingly easy two-day initiation rite turns sinister. Cast *Annie Clark as Gillian *Daniel Kash as Ray *Richard Clarkin as Fred *Steven Love as Marty *Alyssa Capriotti as Lacey *Sarah Emes as Janie *Sonia Laplante as Therapist *Megann McCandless as Gillian's Sister Reception Critical reception for Solo has been mixed to positive. Common praise centered around the film's restraint and slow build towards suspense, and Fearnet commented that the movie was \\"rather quietly intense and engaging\\". Criticisms for Solo tended to center around elements that the reviewers felt were \\"predictable twists and turns that fans of the genre will be able to catch from the end of the first act\\". Twitch Film gave a mostly negative review, as they felt that the film did not make use of its full potential and that more use of the film's inspiration or of sound would have improved the movie's tension.

Johann Georg Stauffer (also Johann Georg Staufer; born January 26, 1778 in Vienna; died 24 January 1853) was an Austrian luthier and the most important Viennese luthier of his time. Life Stauffer was born in the Viennese suburb of Wei√ügerber, the son of Mathias Stauffer, a labourer from Weyregg am Attersee. He studied under the luthier Franz Geissenhof. In June 1800 he took the Vienna oath of citizenship and in May 1802 he married Josepha Fischer in the Schottenkirche, Vienna. He took over the workshop of Ignaz Christian Bartl.Stefan Hackl: Die Gitarre in √ñsterreich ‚Äì Von Abate Costa bis Zykan. In: Die Wiener Schule des Gitarrenbaus. Innsbruck, Wien, Bozen 2011, S. 79. Initially he built instruments modeled after the Italian guitar masters Giovanni Battista Fabricatore and Gaetano Vinaccia, he then developed several variants, typical of his own guitar style (see section Instruments). In 1813/14, he applied for the vacant position of Court Luthier (\\"Hofgeigenmacher\\") but Johann Martin Stoss was preferred. From 1830-1836 Stauffer was also active as a music publisher. He devoted more time to his inventions, which is probably the reason for the beginning of his serious financial problems. In 1829 he made representations to the City Council for an advance of 1,000 guilders.Helga Haupt: Wiener Instrumentenbauer von 1791 bis 1815. In: Studien zur Musikwissenschaft. 1960, S. 120‚Äì184. In 1831/32 his financial troubles continued and he was finally arrested for debt. He then worked temporarily in the workshop of his son Johann Anton Stauffer, before settling for a short time in Ko≈°ice (now in Slovakia). The last period of his life Stauffer spent in Vienna's St. Marx citizens care home, where he could continue to work in a small workshop on his ideas for the guitar and other instruments. There he developed several guitars with completely new concepts (such as guitars with an oval body and double back), which were always labeled \\"According to the latest acoustic improvement of Johann Georg Stauffer manufactured in Vienna, Landstrasse 572\\". In 1853 he finally died impoverished, of paralysis of the lungs. Johann Georg Stauffer had threeMichael Lorenz:\\"Stauffer Miscellanea\\", Vienna 2014 sons: *the pianist Franz Stauffer (March 25, 1803 - after 1846). *the luthier and pianist Johann Anton Stauffer (June 12, 1805 - October 28, 1871), who took over his father's workshop in 1833, but only from 1836 onwards built under his own name. *Alois Stauffer (June 7, 1806 - June 23, 1806)  Instruments  thumb left: Johann Georg Stauffer Terz Guitar () right: Vienna Stauffer-style guitar by Christian Frederick Martin (1834‚Äì35) The \\"Viennese guitar\\" as built by Johann Georg Stauffer is a gut string guitar with a curved back, narrower waist and bridge pins. In 1822 Stauffer and Johann Ertl received an imperial commission for improvement of the guitar, focusing on the extension of the fingerboard, above (not attached to) the soundboard, the development of machine heads and the use of embedded metal frets.Kaiserl.-k√∂nigl.

Erster Band, Wien 1841, S. 277 By 1825/30, the instruments usually had a headstock in a figure eight shape (similar in shape to the guitar's body). In 1825 Stauffer invented the machine heads named after him: a metal plate with an asymmetrical \\"scroll\\" headstock, machine heads with worm gears mounted on the plate, arranged in a single line on the upper side of the head stock (six-in-line). This \\"Stauffer\\" headstock and design was reproduced by his son Anton, and copied by many luthiers in the 19th century. The asymmetrical headstock is variously referred to as being shaped like a \\"scroll\\" (a violin scroll in profile), a \\"snail\\", and a \\"Persian slipper\\". The Stauffer-style scroll headstock and tuning machines have been in use since the 19th century and continue to be used on guitar-related instruments in Central Europe such as larger tamburica.http://www.yotke.hr/en/instruments/t-cetveroglasne.phphttp://www.tresnjevka.net/engtamb.htm As of 2018, Stauffer style tuning machines are still made by some companies, and some luthiers continue to make ‚ÄúViennese guitars‚Äù. https://www.rodgers- tuning-machines.com/stauffer-style- tuners/https://www.rubnertuners.com/stauffer-mechanics/ In 1823 J. G. Stauffer built his Arpeggione, an instrument with characteristics of the guitar and the cello. Composer Franz Schubert (1797-1828), who also had a Stauffer guitar, wrote a sonata for the Arpeggione, an otherwise almost unnoticed instrument (see Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano in A minor (D 821)). Stauffer also built Terz guitars, the Contraguitar, and experimented with new forms of violin. The luthier Peter Teufelsdorfer, based in the Hungarian city of Pest was for some time in dispute with Stauffer over some of his inventions, which Teufelsdorfer said he had developed himself (but which may have been invented independently).  Stauffer and CF Martin  Martin 00 Stauffer 175thChristian Frederick Martin, was born in 1796 in Markneukirchen, Germany, a centre for instrument making. Martin first studied with his father, Johann Georg Martin, a cabinet maker. At 15 years of age, he went to Vienna for an apprenticeship with Stauffer, and in 1825, Martin married Ottilie K√ºhle, the daughter the Viennese harp maker Karl K√ºhle. Martin remained in Vienna until at least 1827,Lorenz 2014 after which he returned to his hometown and opened his own shop. After a long dispute with the guild of luthiers regarding the rights of cabinet makers to build guitars, Martin emigrated to the United States of America, where he introduced the mechanism developed by Stauffer and founded Martin Guitars. In 2008, the 175th anniversary of the Martin Company, the company released a tribute guitar: the \\"Martin 00 Stauffer 175th\\".

She was built in 1924 as a fishing lugger and has served as a coaster and schooner under the flags of the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Panama. The ship has been lengthened three times, fitted with four different engines, and has had a change of IMO number during her career on the seas.  History  Rembrandt van Rijn was built in 1924 as the fishing lugger Jacoba by Gebroeders Boot, Leiderdorp, South Holland, Netherlands, for Gebr. Bloot, Katwijk, South Holland. She was launched in November of 1924. Her port of registry was Katwijk, and she was allocated the registration KW146. In 1929, Jacoba was sold to K.K. Jagemann and R.S. Karstens, Hamburg, Germany. She was converted to a motor vessel and was fitted with a diesel engine. Jacoba was then renamed Anna Marta, after which the code letters RGPQ were allocated. Her port of registry at the time was Hamburg. On 18 September 1929, Anna Marta was sold to R.S. Karstens. From 1931 to April 1933, she was operated under the management of H. B√∂se, Altona, Germany. Management then passed to Heinscke & Co. In May 1933, a new diesel engine was fitted. In January 1934, her code letters were changed to DJFI. In March 1933, Anna Marta was lengthened and rebuilt as a three-masted schooner at Kiel. By 1937, Anna Marta was again operated by R. Karstens. She was rebuilt again in 1939. In 1949, Anna Martas code letters were changed to DGCL. In April 1951, she was lengthened at Stade, West Germany, and had a new engine in July. On 19 May 1952, Anna Marta was sold to M. Karstens and H. Pape, Hamburg, West Germany. Ownership passed to Karstens & Pape on 13 August 1954. Another new engine was fitted in 1957. On 26 January 1962, Anna Marta was sold to H.E. Hansen, Marstal, Denmark, and was renamed Minde. Her port of registry was Marstal, and the code letters OZFX were allocated. With the introduction of fixed Lloyd's Register numbers in the late 1960s, Minde was allocated 5235715, which later became her IMO number. In 1971, she was sold to A.K. Nielsen, Broager, Denmark, and was renamed Klaus D. Her port of registry was Egersund, but her code letters remained unchanged. On 22 March 1974, her home port was changed to Broager, although she remained with Egersund as her port of registry. During one of these rebuilds, the ship was derigged and returned to being a motor vessel. Klaus D was a refrigerated cargo vessel. In 1984, Klaus D was sold to A.M. Tichelaar, Leeuwarden, Netherlands. In August 1985, she was sold to Stichting Werkgelegenheid Projecten, Groningen, Netherlands, and was renamed Enno Doedens Star. Two new diesel engines were fitted to her in 1986. This was followed by a rebuild to a three-masted schooner at Vlissingen, Zeeland, Netherlands, in 1993. She was renamed Rembrandt van Rijn and reflagged to Panama. The call sign 3FVE7 was allocated. From 1994 to 1996, Rembrandt van Rijn operated cruises to Spitsbergen, Norway. In 1998 or 1999 a different IMO number, 8941808, was allocated. She was sold in October 1998 to Balder Nieuwland B.V., Vlissingen, and placed under the management of Oceanwide Nautical Services B.V. Rembrandt van Rijn operated cruises between Panama and the Galapagos Islands from 1998 to 2001. In 2007, she was laid up at Ghent, Belgium. In December 2011, Rembrandt van Rijn was reflagged to Vanuatu. She was given her current call sign, YJRJ3, and the MMSI number 576988000. Rembrandt van Rijn has a crew of 12 and can accommodate 33 passengers. Description Jacoba was long with a beam of when built. She was assessed at , .

Since the Middle Ages it has also existed as a Roman Catholic titular see. The current metropolitan (since 2008) is Georgios Mantzouranis. History Seal of John, Metropolitan of Thebes, 10th/11th century The 11th-century Hosios Loukas monastery in Boeotia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site Christianity is said to have come to Boeotia with Apostle Paul and Luke the Evangelist in 56/57 AD, who are said to have installed the first local bishop, Saint Rufus. Luke spent much of his life in Boeotia and died there. He came to be regarded as the patron saint of Thebes, the capital of Boeotia, and his remains were interred in the city's cathedral. The first attested bishop, Cleonicus, attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Le Quien also lists Julius at the Synod of Sardica in 344; Anysius at the Council of Ephesus in 431; Architimus in 458; Marcianus in 867. The history of the city and the bishopric in the early Byzantine period is obscure. However, based on the Notitiae Episcopatuum, the see had been elevated to an archbishopric by 906, possibly connected to the city becoming the capital of the theme of Hellas, occupying the 30th place among the archdioceses of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. By the 12th century, it had become a metropolitan see, numbering five suffragan sees ca. 1170. At this time, the see was headed by John Kaloktenes, who became a saint as \\"Saint John the New Merciful\\" due to his charitable works. In the late 13th century, the see ranked as 57th among the 110 metropolitan sees. Following the Fourth Crusade, Thebes became the seat of a Latin Archbishop and a Franciscan custody. Following the Ottoman conquest in the mid-15th century, The Latin archbishopric became a titular see, vacant since 1965. Under Ottoman rule, the Metropolis of Thebes ranked 37th among 72 metropolitan sees of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. By the early 18th century, however, it appears as a simple bishopric, and following Greek independence, it was renamed as the Bishopric of Thebes and Livadeia, with its seat at Livadeia, on 9 July 1852. Since 1922, the see was again promoted to a metropolis, covering three eparchies: Thebes, Livadeia, and Avlida. It currently has 130 parishes and 24 monasteries.

Since the 1990s, she has served as one of the expedition cruise vessels for Oceanwide Expeditions, sailing to some of the most remote locations in the Arctic, particularly the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.  History  Flensburg underway in 1961 Noorderlicht is a steel two-masted schooner built in 1910 in Flensburg, Germany, by Flensburger Schiffbau- Gesellschaft for the Imperial German Navy. The ship was originally named Fs Kalkgrund II, rigged as a three-masted schooner, and used as a light vessel (Feuerschiff) on the Kalkgrund station off the Flensburg Firth. It also functioned as a weather ship and pilot station. The middle mast was taken out to improve stability during World War II, when the vessel was in the service of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and named Flensburg. An anti-aircraft gun was also fitted to it. After the war, the vessel continued to serve as a light ship until it was retired in 1963. Between 1963 and 1992, the vessel had a number of owners. It was used as a workers' hostel for a time, and from 1967 to 1986, as a clubhouse for the sailing association M√∂ltenorter Seglerkameradschaft at Heikendorf. Afterward, it was sold to the Netherlands. In 1991, the vessel was found in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, by the current owners, Ted van Broeckhuysen and Gert Ritzema. They had the ship re-rigged, restored, and equipped with an auxiliary engine. After renaming it Noorderlicht, the ship entered service as an expedition cruise vessel. Since 2011, it has been operated in Svalbard by Oceanwide Expeditions, based in Vlissingen, Netherlands. On 31 May 2016, Noorderlicht ran aground on the north coast of Vlieland. The 28 children on board were taken off by a KNRM rescue boat. On 18 September, she ran aground again at Trygghamna, Norway. She was re-floated with assistance from a tug deployed by the Norwegian tug .  Cruise vessel  Noorderlichts schedule is based at Longyearbyen, Svalbard. It runs voyages in the archipelago, the Lofoten islands, and to mainland locations within the polar regions. Ten cabins provide accommodation for up to 20 passengers, and two rigid-hulled inflatable boats are carried to enable close-up viewing of wildlife and landscapes in otherwise inaccessible areas. Between 2002 and 2015, Noorderlicht was intentionally ice-locked at Tempelfjorden, Svalbard, during the winter months to provide base-camp accommodation for Arctic journeys.

Polyphony (contrapuntal and ostinato variation) is common in African music and heterophony (the voices move at different times) is a common technique as well. Although these principles of traditional (precolonial and pre-Arab) African music are of Pan-African validity, the degree to which they are used in one area over another (or in the same community) varies. Specific techniques that used to generate harmony in Africa are the \\"span process\\", \\"pedal notes\\" (a held note, typically in the bass, around which other parts move), \\"Rhythmic harmony\\", \\"harmony by imitation\\", and \\"scalar clusters\\" (see below for explanation of these terms).  General overview  \\"By Western standards, African music is characteristically complex...Two or more events tend to occur simultaneously within a musical context. Even players of simple solo instruments (such as the musical bow or the flute) manage to manipulate the instrument in such a way to produce simultaneous sounds by playing overtones with the bow, by humming while bowing, and the like...Overlapping choral antiphony and responsorial singing are principal types of African polyphony. Various combinations of ostinato and drone-ostinato, polymelody (mainly two-part), and parallel intervals are additional polyphonic techniques frequently employed. Several types may intermingle within one vocal or instrumental piece, with the resulting choral or orchestral tendency being the stacking of parts or voices. Consequently three- or four-part density is not an uncommon African musical feature. Such densities are constantly fluctuating so that continuous triads throughout an entire piece are uncommon. Canonic imitation may occur in responsorial or antiphonal sections of African music as a result of the repetition of the first phrase or the introduction of new melodic material in the form of a refrain. The latter may involve a contrasting section or a completion of the original melody.\\" ‚ÄîKarlton E. HesterKarlton E. Hester, Bigotry and the Afrocentric ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù Evolution, Third Edition, Global academic publishing, published, April 30, 2004 Chordal relationships that occur as a result of the polyphony, homophonic parallelism and homophonic polyphony found in African music are not always 'functional' in the western musical sense. However, they accomplish the balance of tension- release and dissonance-consonance. In addition, they form varieties of chord combinations and clusters, as well as varying levels of harmonic patterning.  Scales  Anhemitonic pentatonic scale in descending order as conceptualized by African musicians Chords are constructed from scales. Pentatonic and hexatonic scales are very common scales across Africa. Nonetheless, heptatonic scales can be found in abundance. Anhemitonic scales, equal heptatonic scales, and scales based on the selected use of partials are used in Africa as well. The same community that may use one set of instruments tuned to a certain scale (i.e. pentatonic), can use a different scale for a different set of instruments, or song type (i.e. heptatonic) (Gerhard KubikGerhard Kubik, Theory of African music, volume I, University of Chicago Press, Lid., London, published 1994Gerhard Kubik, Theory of African music, volume II, University of Chicago Press, Lid., London, published 2010Gerhard Kubik, Bebop: a case in point. The African Matrix in Jazz Harmonic Practices. Black Music Research Journal, published March 22, 2005) In traditional African music, scales are practised and thought of as descending from top to bottom. African harmony is based on the scales being employed in a particular musical setting. Scales have a profound impact on the harmony because Africans modalize their music. Modalization is the process of applying modal concepts in a non-modal setting. African music uses recurring harmonic reference points as a means of musical organization. Therefore, African music is not modal or purely based on one mode. Nonetheless modal concepts are employed in African music. This predates exposure to Western and Arab musics.  Principles  = Homophonic parallelism and homophonic polyphony = Homophonic parallelism in a Traditional African context. Rhythm is simplified in this example. Parallelism in this example is based on thirds. Homophonic parallelism is the harmonizing of a single melody, or subordinate melody and moving with it in parallel. This means the notes that harmonize the melody follow its characteristic shape and rhythm. This type of parallelism is common to all African peoples. The degree to which it is employed varies. It is important to note that parallelism in thirds (inversely tenths), fourths, fifths, and octaves (inversely unison) are Pan-African methods of homophonic parallel harmonization. These intervals are interchanged depending on the melody they are accompanying and the scale source of the harmonization. Homophonic polyphony occurs when two different melodies are harmonized in the style of homophonic parallelism, and either (1) occur simultaneously by means of overlapping antiphony or (2) over at the simultaneously as a result of melodic counterpoint. This parallelism is not to be confused with strict parallelism. Gerhard Kubik states that much variation and freedom is permitted in parallel parts, with the stipulation that words remain intelligible (or in the case of instruments the melody remains recognizable), and the scalar source is observed. The harmonic line harmonized normally moves by step rarely jumping beyond a fourth. \\"A.M. Jones states that 'generally speaking all over the continent south of the Sahara, African harmony is in organum and is sung either in parallel fourths, parallel fifths, parallel octaves or parallel thirds.' Parallelism, however, is not without limitations. Melodic and scale considerations, as has been shown, are of primary importance in deciding what notes are employed in harmonizing tunes and, consequently, what intervals are formed. The adaptation of parallelism to fit melodic requirements is much more apparent in the music of those areas of Africa where the pentatonic scale is the norm. Kirby has shown how the demands of a pentatonic scale result in the employment of sixths in Bantu polyphony, where parallelism in fifths is the principle. He points out that the limitations of the pentatonic scale make for the awareness of other intervals instead of what apparently was the strict duplication of the melody at the same interval employed by early European musicians.\\"‚ÄîLazarus EkwemeLazarus Ekwueme, Concepts of African musical theory, Journal of Black Studies, Vol 5. no. 1, Sage publications, inc. published 1974. = Secondary melody = The two measures on the left show the framework for chorus. This framework is the secondary melody that this chorus response is based on. The two measures on the right show the application of the span process in both the upward and downward direction on the secondary melody (counter melody). This example is in thirds. The same secondary melody from the example above this time with the span process applied only in the upward direction. The harmonization of a subordinate melody ‚Äì be it responsoral or with regular repetitions within the cycle ‚Äì is often based on a counter melody or secondary melody. From this melody the span process, pedal notes and other techniques can be used to for the harmony supporting the main melody. Gerhard Kubik notes \\"In the Ijesha multipart singing style the basic chorus phrase, to which harmonically parallel lines may be added above and below, is the one in the middle, standing at the same pitch level with the leader's phrase...The basic chorus line is the one with which the chorus member singing alone would invariably link 'in unison' with the leader's phrase. as other chorus members join in, more voices are then added above and below in intervals perceived as consonant. These additional voices are essentially euphoric in concept; they are equivalent to a basic one, but are only collaterally dependent on the voice of the leader\\". Lazarus Ekweme quotes J. H. Kwabena Nketia saying \\"In chorus response, there is primacy in the sense that one line is regarded as the basic melody. But the supporting line, by virtue of its running parallel to it, shares its characteristic progressions and is accordingly treated as a secondary melody. Indeed, when a cantor has to sing the chorus response, he may have the freedom of singing either of the two or of moving from one section to the other.\\" Secondary melody in this case refers to the voice harmonizing the chorus response. However, the chorus response is the secondary melody, which is harmonized. The harmonizing parts can vary just as the chorus response (or secondary melody) may vary. The added harmony part embellishes its own line as an independent melody, instead of following rigidly the intervocalic distance from the main chorus line in parallel movement. The underlying concept is to create a melody and then a responsoral secondary melody. This secondary melodic line or phrase is then harmonized in parallel motion. The harmonic line harmonized normally moves by step rarely jumping beyond a fourth. = Ostinato-variation = Musical instruments in traditional African music often serve as a modal and/or rhythmic support for vocal music. Instrumental Music can also be heard frequently without vocal music and to a lesser extent solo. Harmony produced through ostinato produced on instruments is common place. These ostinati can be varied, or embellished, but otherwise provide modal support. Ostinato used in African music is a principal means of polyphony although other procedures for producing polyphony exist. Arom Simha states \\"music in the Central African Republic, regardless of the kind of polyphony or polyrhythm that is practiced, always involves the principle of ostinato with variations.\\"Simha Arom, African Polyphony and Polyrhythm. Structure and Methodology (Pr√©face de Gy√∂rgi Ligeti), Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, published 2004 [1991]. The principle of ostinato with variations is significant to African music and its polyphonic nature as most forms of traditional African polyphony are based on this principle. Simha continues \\"If one had to describe in a formula all the polyphonic and polyrhythmic procedures used in the Central African Republic, one might define them as ostinato (ostinati) with variations.\\" The ostinato is normally used to create a modal pattern or background. Arom Simha continues \\"This definition does not conflict with Western musicological definitions of the term. Thus Riemann defines ostinato as 'a technical term that describes the continual return of a theme surrounded by ever changing counterpoint [...] The great masters of the age of polyphony loved to write a whole mass or long motets on a single phrase constantly repeated by the tenor. But the repetitions are not always identical, and the little theme would appear in all sorts of modified forms' (Riemann 1931:953).\\" Many African musics correspond exactly to this definition and are musical pieces based on a phrase, which reappears in varied and modified forms. These ostinato can be continuous or intermittent, vocal or instrumental, and may appear above or below the main line. Frequently in African music two or more ostinatos moving contrapuntally are employed, with or without a longer melodic line to create an orchestral texture (dense textures are desired and aimed for by both composers and performers alike). This type of polyphony is of the contrapuntal or horizontal type. In practice each ostinato moves in independent melodic and rhythmic patterns.  Cadences and chord structures  Chords are normally formed using one of two techniques: the span process or scalar clusters. These chords can be embellished as a result of variation in which any combination of notes permitted by the scale can be used in a chord. However, in common practice, chords are formed by harmonizing in 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths, etc. The type of chord formed depends on the scale system being used. Recent research has shown that African music has chord progressions. Gerhard Kubik states \\"until recently, little attention has been paid to a further structuring element, namely, the tonal-harmonic segmentation of a cycle. In most African music, cycles are sub-divided into two, four or eight tonal-harmonic segments.\\" (A theory of African music, Volume II, page 44, paragraph 5). In addition, the use of the tritone interval for tension is common in Africa. Oluwaseyi KehindeOluwaseyi Kehinde, Dissonance and Chromatic Inflections in Traditional African Music, British Journal of Arts and Social Sciences , Vol. 3 No. 1, published 2011, British Journal Publishing, Inc. 2011 notes \\"it is interesting that the interval of the tritone (augmented fourth or diminished fifth) is a salient feature in both vocal and instrumental music throughout Africa‚Äù (Karlton E. Hester and Francis Tovey use the same phrase to describe it). Gerhard Kubik in his article \\"bebop a case in point: the African matrix in Jazz harmonic practices\\" and his book \\"Africa and the Blues\\"Gerhard Kubik, Africa and the Blues, University of Mississippi Press, published 2000 echoes this point. This is significant to chords used as reference points or chord progressions in African musical structures. Through the use of parallelism cadential patterns are inevitable. O.O. Bateye clarifies: \\"The subdominant (plagal) cadence is (resulting from the frequent tendency toward parallelism in African music) the favored cadence and not the perfect cadence, which is the norm in classical western music...Cadential patterns are frequent in African music and invariably result as a consequence of melodic movement either by thirds, fourths, or fifths ‚Äì that is as a consequence of what may be referred to as shadow harmony ... A cadential descending minor third is frequently noted between the minor third step and the tonic (Reiser, 1982:122) in African music.\\"O. O. Bateye, Defining African Traditional Musical Traits: Resource Material for African Art Music Composition, Nigerian Music Review Vol. 6 2005: pp. 61‚Äì74 These cadential movements are made using the melody and the scale as the guiding factor. He continues \\"T.K. Philips objects to the te- doh and fah-me cadences as being authentic for African music, but nevertheless, as has been pointed out, are a frequent occurrence in African music utilizing scales other than the pentatonic. The presence of drones (see pedal notes below) is a common feature of African music.\\" = \\"Target Chords\\" = African music whose scalar source for the harmony is based on anhemtonic (every note is consonant with every other note) pentatonic and hexatonic scalar sources, Targeting specific vertical structures in relation to the secondary melodic phrase being harmonized is not a concern although this does happen. For scalar systems that are not anhemtonic, target chords or vertical structures that are targeted for resolution are common place. Although the arrangement of the notes may be altered and/or embellished notes viewed as dissonant traditionally will be omitted from that structure. In Harp music and xylophone music with 2 beaters these structures are dyads and are targeted for resolution by means of suspensions, anticipations, and other techniques of variation. The \\"target chord\\" concept is applied equally to homomphonic parallelism and its various iterations as it is to polyphony. These vertical combinations by means of their strict repetition serve as an organizing structure to the improvised nature of the harmonic motions. = Polyphony = Polyphonic techniques used in African music include: *Melodic counterpoint ‚Äì related to homophony, however there is no predominant melodic line or no hierarchy among the parts. Although it is not a general rule, all the parts frequently observe the same rhythmic values. *Polymelody ‚Äì two different melodies with different start and end points occurring simultaneously. *Ostinato-variation ‚Äì variations on a theme with an onstinato or ostinati above or below the melody line. *Hocket ‚Äì interlocking, interweaving and overlapping rhythmic figures which are tiered on different pitches in a scalar system. *Polyphony by polyrhythmics ‚Äì Polyphony normally does not occur unless the melodies are rhythmically independent. When two African melodies occur at the same time and are rhythmically independent it is polyphony. *Polyphony by inherent patterns ‚Äì using auxiliary and passing note groups separated by disjunct intervals gives the facade of two melodies occurring back to back. This technique is used often by solo instrumentalists to create a pseudo- polyphony. (Definitions Arom Simha)  Techniques  Traditional African music often employs the following techniques to create harmony: = Span process = A chorus response in a heptatonic tradition. The use of the span process (or skipping process) results in the freedom of singers to add vocal parts. Here four part chord is used right before the final word of the chorus response. 3 and four part clusters are common in African music. However, their use is generally restricted by the number of singers available and type of scalar system being used for the song in question. Span process applied to a hexatonic scalar system. The resulting chord combinations can be seen to the right. Triadic harmony in African music. This example is based on the pentatonic scale. Triads consisting of the intervals of a third and a fourth are just as common as those containing 2 intervals of a third. Triadic harmony is normal used to emphasize a point in the song text and/or melody. Gerhard Kubik describes succinctly a process he attributes to the formation of chords used in parallelism throughout Africa. This process he calls the \\"span process\\". He states \\"The Span process or skipping process,(is) a structural principle implying that usually one note of a given scale is skipped by a second singer (or instrumental line) to obtain harmonic simultaneous sound in relation to the melodic line of a first vocalist (or instrumental line)\\". The harmonic line harmonized normally moves by step rarely jumping beyond a fourth. = Pedal notes = A frequent technique employed in African music (either as a means of variation or as part of a harmonic reference point) in which notes are repeated (on a monotone) in a part while others move in parallel motion above it. When there are at least 3 singers, the two or more upper parts follow the shape of the tune, while maintaining the intonation of the words, in parallel or similar motion. The lowest part repeats a basic drone (pedal notes can equally be found in higher voices as well). The repetitions may be temporary or extended depending on the performers and the particular musical piece. The employment of pedal notes is often the sources that oblique motion and contrary motion in African choral music. This technique is also applied to instrumental music.‚ÄîLazarus Ekweme Here a pedal note in the lowest voice is being employed. The harmony above moves in parallel within the scalar source for the harmony. In this case it is the pentatonic scale. = Rhythmic harmony = A chorus response in a heptatonic tradition. The use of the span process (or skipping process) results in the freedom of singers to add vocal parts. The use of four part harmony emphasizes the final parts of the chorus response. this is rhythmic harmony. The use of harmony to enhance a rhythmic accent or to emphasize a note in the melody. these normally occur at the end of melodic phrases, but may take place anywhere it is desirable to accentuate a note or text in the melody. = Harmony by imitation = This is an example of Traditional African Harmony by imitation. The melody here plays a phrase in the first measure and sequences it melodically in the second measure. The second voice (in the bass clef) imitates the melody in the first measure. As a result, singing both the new phrase and original phase at once creates harmony between the parts. this harmony may be in parallel motion (as seen above) or it may be of a different type depending on the variations the melody makes on the original phrase. This occurs when an added part imitates the shape of a portion of the melody (or other portion of the song) at a higher or lower pitch and after the initial musical phrase but overlapping with it. Due to tonal inflections (in the regions using tonal languages), the shape of the new musical phrase is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, that of the previous one. The use of imitation accounts for a wide variety of interval combinations within the scale system being used in African musics. = Scalar clusters = Scalar Clusters resulting from embellishments or ornamentation to reference points in xylophone music. Clusters themselves can be used deliberately as a reference point in a traditional African composition. This is a simplified version of 4 reference points embellished with other scale tones. The second measure shows the scalar source of the harmony. Due to variations and melodic concerns scalar clusters occur not only incidentally but at times are purposely aimed for by the musicians. In parallel motion, rhythmic harmony or in harmonic patterns varying interval combinations can be found. However, all these intervals are limited to those permitted by the scale. The intervals of the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, octave, ninth and tenth can all be found. As African music and harmony is based on a cyclical structure with recurring reference points and harmonic reference points (or chords) some of these intervals are seen as color tones while others have structural significance. Generally the tones and intervals of structural significance are based on thirds, fourths, fifths, and octaves. Simha states \\"In Central African polyphony, one can in fact find clusters of all the combinations of intervals allowed by the scale. The number of sounds included in vertical combinations varies with the number and type of performing instruments: while there are no more than two in Sanza music, it is not unusual to find four in xylophone music. In the limiting case, it can happen that the 5 sounds of the scale are simultaneously emitted as a cluster. This particular type of verticality can easily be explained by referring each sound comprising a 'chord' or sound cluster to its own melodic axis. It then becomes clear that the vertical configurations are the (partly fortuitous) consequence of the horizontal conception of melodic counterpoint.\\" This not only occurs when using pentatonic scales. Gerhard Kubik notes that the use of a partials derived system, or a Bordon system can also lead to the use of scalar clusters as consonance. In addition communities, and ethnic groups that use pentatonic systems many times also employ hexatonic and heptatonic scalar systems.  Variation principle  The variation principle describes the process of altering, embellishing, and modifying of melodic, rhythmic, harmonic, and/or other parts of a musical structure. These variations are made within and/or around the role of the part being varied. These variations rarely break the function of the part to be varied. In African music these variations are often improvised. Variation in African music are abundant and the musicians view them as necessary. Simha Arom states, \\"All musical pieces are characterized by cyclic structure that generates numerous improvised variations: repetition and variation is one of the most fundamental principles of all Central African musics,as indeed of many other musics in Black Africa.\\" He continues, \\"Finally, improvisation, which I have described as the driving force behind melodic and rhythmic variations, plays an important part in every group. But there is no such thing as free improvisation, that is, improvisation that does not refer back to some precise and identifiable piece of music. It is always subordinate to the musical structure in which it appears...\\" Variation is a very important aspect in African music (and the musics of the African diaspora). At every level of music variation is expected, with the stipulation that the structure of the part being played is not compromised. Harmony is no exception. He explains: \\"Melodic and rhythmic variations can, however, affect the instrumental formula, just as they can appear in the song the formula supports and summarizes. These variations engender a large variety of vertical combinations, or consonances.\\" Vertical combinations in African music have two different yet complementary functions. One function is that of being a structural reference point. The other is that of being an embellishment, or \\"color tone\\". Arom Simha proceeds to note \\"We have already remarked that specific vertical combinations in each formula act as temporal reference points by virtue of their regular repetition at a given position in the periodic cycle. These combinations are the points at which several superposed melodic lines meet. They are usually based on octaves, fifths, and fourths, precisely the intervals which make up sections 1-4 of Chailley's resonance table (i960: 35), and this is certainly no accident. We may therefore assume that they take on a structural function.\\" These vertical combinations that constitute reference points are chords that, together, form a chord progression. This is similar to the concepts of chords and progressions in cyclical forms in Jazz, Blues and other musics of the African diaspora. Simha concludes \\"All other consonances can be viewed in the same way as the result of conjunctions of different melodies, but unlike the regularly repeated ones, their content (and at times even their position) is an arbitrary consequence of the numerous melodic and, particularly, rhythmic variations allowed in the various realizations of the formula. Consonances of this type seem intended to provide color, over and above the melodic nature of their constituent elements. This is a natural consequence of the fact that musicians tend to make full use of their available resources to enrich and variegate the texture of sound when performing cyclic music.\\" These harmonic variations combined with rhythmic variations explain (in addition to the implementation of pedal notes) both \\"oblique\\" phenomena (anticipations and suspensions) and horizontal phenomena (drones and broken or ornamented pedal points). David LockeDavid Locke, Improvisation in west African music, Music Educators Journal, Vol. 66, No. 5, Published by: MENC: The National Association for Music Educationpublished Jan., 1980, pp. 125‚Äì133, Published by: MENC: The National Association for Music Education in an article entitled \\"improvisation in west African music\\" states \\"...African musicians do improvise on various aspects of music, including melody, text, form, polyphony, rhythm, and timbre.\\" These improvisations are based on preexisting musical structures and as such are variations and embellishments. The Principles and techniques outlined above are all subject to variation not only by region, and the people, but also, by spontaneously improvised variations during performance. This creates complex harmonies. This is similar to the way Jazz musicians during a performance will alter a chord and embellish it with different \\"color tones\\", while still emphasizing principle chord tones so as not to disrupt the chord progression of the song.http://www.tinotenda.org/improvisation.htm Homophonic parallelism is also affected by this variation principle. With regards to improvised vocal parts within homophonic parallelism Gerhard Kubik in his book \\"Theory of African music\\", volume I says, \\"Another implicit concept of this multi-part musical system is linearity, i.e. each voice exists in its own right, though at the same time there remains the perspective of simultaneous vertical sound. All participants sing the same text, but their melodic lines are not parallel throughout, as might be expected from the tonal inflections of the language. on the contrary, oblique and counter-movement is consciously employed in order to emphasize the individuality of each participating voice. contrary motion is not always perceptible in recordings because the voices merge with one another. In practice an individual singer in the group can change the direction of his melodic line whenever he likes...An individual singer can also string up several variants of his voice part successively along the time- line. In 'chiyongoyongo' for instance, there are dozens of simultaneous variants possible and each are perceived as correct. this leads to a very lively style of variation, in which each individual voice is conceived to be linear and independent while contributing to the euphoric whole.\\" He continues \\"Where the precepts of tonal languages permit it (and this is the case in eastern Angola) we can thus find a kind of multi-part singing which transcends the \\"parallel harmony,\\" so often described by authors as typical of one or the other African style. The multi-part singing style of the peoples of eastern Angola, including the Mbwela, Luchazi, Chokwe, Luvale and others is only parallel in theory. the creation of harmonic sound is accomplished within a relatively loose combination of individual voices, fluctuating between triads, bichords and more or less dense accumulations of notes. the exact shape of the chords, the duplication and omissions of individual notes in the total pattern may change with every repetition.\\"  Traditional African harmony as the basis for jazz and blues harmony  See: *Gerhard Kubik's A case in point: Bebop: the African matrix in Jazz harmonic practices *Gerhard Kubik's Africa and the Blues *Gerhard Kubiks's Theory of African Music volumes I and II *David Locke's Improvisation in West Africa *Karlton E.

The foam pump outputs the liquid in the form of foam and it is operated by squeezing. The parts of the foam pump, mostly made from polypropylene (PP), are similar to those of other pump devices. The foaming pump often comes with a protective cap. Operation A foam pump dispenses doses of the liquid contained in the bottle in the form of foam. Foam is created in the foaming chamber. The liquid constituents are mixed in the foaming chamber and this is discharged through a nylon mesh. The neck finish size of a foam pump is bigger than the neck finish size of other types of pumps, to accommodate the foamer chamber. The usual neck size of a foam pump is 40 or 43mm. Where hair-coloring products previously contained instructions to vigorously shake the product, squeeze the bottle, and turn upside-down to disperse the product, foamers do not require any such actions. Some foaming dispensers include suction on the bottom to allow the container to remain upright. Foamers can be purchased alone, or filled with a liquid product like soap. When the liquid is mixed with air, the liquid product can be dispersed through the pump-top as a foam. Foamers can also be re-used with different liquid products to extend the mass of the liquid by creating a foam- version. Applications The foam pump is widely used for dispensing cosmetic products and household chemicals, such as mousse foam cleansing, hand washing liquid, hand sanitizer, facial cleanser, shaving cream, hair conditioning mousse, sun protection foam, spot removers, baby products, and so on. In the field of food and beverages, molecular gastronomy style foam is usually created using various techniques and stabilizers such as lecithin, but there is at least one ready-to-use liqueur that has been developed with the foaming apparatus top that produces an alcoholic foam topping for drinks.

Life Born about 1536, at Kedleston in Derbyshire, he became a scholar at Winchester College in 1549. He went on to New College, Oxford, and was made perpetual fellow in 1555. He graduated B.A. in 1558, and M.A. in 1561. In 1560 Johnson was recommended made to Archbishop Matthew Parker by Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, and appointed to the head- mastership of Winchester College. He remained there for ten years. Johnson, who had always intended to become a physician, practised in Winchester while he was still head-master. He was granted the degree of bachelor of medicine at Oxford, with licence to practise, 14 December 1569, and proceeded M.D. 23 June 1571. In 1570 he resigned his post at Winchester, and moved to London, where he practised within the parish of St. Dunstan-in-the-West. He was admitted a fellow of the London College of Physicians about 1580, and filled several of the college offices: as censor in 1581 and several subsequent years; elect, 28 May 1594; consiliarius, 1594‚Äì6; treasurer, 1594‚Äì6. Johnson died in July 1597 in London, leaving a fortune and several children. Works Johnson was a reputed Latin poet of his time. He published Ranarum et murium pugna, Latina versione donata, ex Homero, London, 1580, and wrote three poems in connection with Winchester, Ortus atque vita Gul. Wykehami Winton. Episcopi, dated 14 December 1564, in elegiacs; Custodum sive Pr√¶sidum Coll. Winton. series; and Didascalorum Coll. Wint. omnium Elenchus. All these were published at the close of the Poemata (1573) by Richard Willes. In 1564 Johnson edited and had printed for the use of his scholars two orations delivered at Louvain by Richard White of Basingstoke, De circulo Artium et Philosophi√¶, and De Eloquenti√¢ et Cicerone.‚Äô In 1568 White dedicated to him a short Latin dissertation on an ancient epitaph (√Ülia L√¶lia Crispis. Epitaphium, Padua). Johnson's only medical work was a Counsel against the Plague, or any other Infectious Disease, with a Question, Whether a man for preservation may be purged in the Dog-days or No?, London, 1577.

The show was the creation of a duo, Hugo Farrant and Giordano Nanni, based in Australia and consists of a rapped \\"news report\\" with social commentary using comical rap lyrics. The show is known for using satire and rap rhyming to analyse important topics of the day in a humorous, yet philosophical fashion. Juice Rap News is distributed via YouTube. Some episodes were licensed to the international television news channel RT for rebroadcast. The audience of Juice Rap News is international and episodes have been translated into more than 20 languages. 35 episodes were produced in total, plus a video announcing that the 35th episode was the final they would produce. However, in September 2016, due to audience demand, Giordano Nanni produced a special episode for that year's United States presidential election, and announced that the series would continue to produce content from time to time, with a new crew. Nanni and Farrant co-wrote and produced the series together in their home studio in Melbourne, Australia. Nanni focused on content (crafting the arguments, narrative and perspectives depicted and explored in the show); while Farrant focused on form (giving the dialogue the \\"rhyme and flow\\" of rap and performing the vocals of most of the characters). Farrant portrayed the anchor Robert Foster and a host of other characters, including the regulars General Baxter and Terrence Moonseed. Nanni also appeared in the show, portraying many characters, such as Aussie correspondent Ken Oathcarn, \\"MSMBS\\" host Brian Washington, PR host Ivan Sakamunev, Bill de Berg and George Torwell, all using vox by Hugo Farrant. The goal was to provide an alternative view on world events, one that they felt was lacking in popular media outlets. Recurring Fictional Characters  = Robert Foster = Robert Foster, performed by Hugo Farrant, is the anchor and central character of Rap News. = General Baxter = Darth H. Baxter, also performed by Hugo Farrant, is a caricature representing the Military Industrial Complex. When war is in the news, General Baxter is called upon to give the point of view of war-mongering, colonialist governance. Baxter often changes his uniform to represent the topic. = Terrence Moonseed = Terrence Moonseed, again performed by Hugo Farrant, is the caricature of the resident mad pseudo- scientist / hippy that often counterpoints General Baxter with new age spirituality and conspiracy theories. = Ken Oathcarn = Ken Oathcarn, portrayed by Giordano Nanni (with vox by Hugo Farrant), is an Australian bogan stereotype and correspondent for Rap News who appears when Rap News handles Australian-centric topics. In July 2013, Ken Oathcarn visited Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to give Assange a \\"makeover\\" for his campaign for senate in Australia. = Brian Washington (Brain Washing) = Fictional news reporter for \\"MSMBS\\" (which is an acronym for Mainstream Media Bullshit and also similar to MSNBC), portraying mainstream American news reporters in a satirical manner. = William De Berg = William De Berg (Bill De Berg - Bilderberg) is a shady businessman who takes advantage of the situation to capitalise. He represents the international business elite colluding to control government policies and legal systems. He also represents the Illuminati and the New World Order. Bill de Berg filled in for Robert Foster and hosted Episode 36, about the 2016 US Presidential Election.  Cameo Appearances  = Julian Assange = Julian Assange appeared in Rap News Number 5 only a few weeks before the \\"Cablegate\\" story broke in December 2010. Later, in Episode 20, Assange gets a \\"makeover\\" by Ken Oathcarn, donning a mullet wig, singing John Farnham's \\"You're the Voice\\" recorded in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange is currently receiving political asylum. = Noam Chomsky = Linguist and political writer Noam Chomsky appeared in Rap News 10. Chomsky's segment was recorded whilst he was visiting Australia to collect the 2011 City of Sydney Peace Prize. = Kristinn Hrafnsson = Investigative journalist and WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson appeared in Rap News 13 (A News Hope) to defend WikiLeaks in the context of Newscorp's phone hacking scandal. = Sage Francis = Hip-hop artist Sage Francis appeared in Rap News 21. = Abby Martin = RT America presenter and journalist Abby Martin appeared in Rap News 23, criticizing military intervention in Crimea. = Norman Finkelstein = American and Jewish political scientist, activist, professor, and author Norman Finkelstein appeared and rapped in Rap News 24, \\"Israel vs Palestine\\", as part of a segment hosted by MSMBS anchorman Brian Washington. Finkelstein calls in to the MSMBS programme and interrupts the conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Brian Washington in order to criticise Israel's actions towards Palestine. He refers to Israel as a \\"lunatic state\\" and tells Bibi to \\"shut up\\" after the Israeli statesman accuses Finkelstein of being a \\"self-hating Jew\\". = DAM = Palestinian rap group DAM appeared and rapped in Rap News 24, \\"Israel vs Palestine\\". The Palestinian trio filmed their scene in Ramallah next to the separation wall that divides Israel from the West Bank. In the episode, they conduct a conversation across the wall with Ken Oathcarn who is on an assignment to Israel to learn about its similarities with Australia as a settler colony. The DAM trio inform Ken Oathcarn about the day of the \\"Nakba\\" and voice their support for a one state solution to the conflict. = Scott Ludlam = Senator of the Australian Greens party, Scott Ludlam appeared and rapped in Rap News 29, criticizing the actions of Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the lead-up to the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit, labelling Mr Abbott's laws as \\"a fascist fuckfest of Orwellian proportions\\" and claiming to \\"go full Gandalf on this government's arse, smack down their laws with a dose of you shall not pass\\" before appearing dressed as Gandalf in the episode's credits. Controversies Rap News 20 caused controversy when it was released during the 2013 Australian Federal Election. Most of the controversy surrounded Julian Assange's appearance in the episode. The character Ken Oathcarn (played by Nanni) convinces Assange that if he is to be successful in his election bid for a Senate seat, he is in need of a make-over. Assange dons a flannel shirt, a blonde mullet wig and a fake Australian flag tattoo, and proceeds to sing a parody of John Farnham's \\"You‚Äôre The Voice.\\" The video went viral soon after being posted online. It also featured on The Chaser's 2013 Federal Election coverageThe Hamster Decides: Episode 3. 2013. TV broadcast. Australian Broadcasting Commission, 28 August 2013. and Ten's The Project.The Project. TV broadcast. Ten Network, 26 August 2013. The offending scene was filmed in London's Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has remained since seeking political asylum on 19 June 2012, which he was granted in August 2012. After Rap News went viral, Assange was publicly chastised for his appearance in the video by Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, who said, :\\"We have sent him a letter: he can campaign politically, but without making fun of Australian politicians. We are not going to allow that. The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling in the politics of the country that grants asylum. But as a matter of courtesy we are not going to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate. Just so long as he doesn't make fun of Australian politicians or people.\\" This was the first public indication of any friction between Assange and his Ecuadorian hosts. Furthermore, many major media outlets failed to recognise Rap News 20 as satire, calling it a \\"campaign video,\\" in what Farrant and Nanni described as \\"true to form.\\" In an interview with ABC Radio, the duo addressed the controversy and confusion, saying, :\\"In the world of the internet parody culture, what we‚Äôre doing is accepted and most people and most of the comments on the video and on Twitter and Facebook are overwhelmingly positive. It‚Äôs no surprise that once things are taken out of context and brought into the world, of, you know, the considerably more sober world of the mainstream media, these out of context quotes can be portrayed as offensive‚Ä¶We don‚Äôt really engage with that audience. Our audience is on the internet. We really pride ourselves on making an internet show and we‚Äôre trying to get people away from the more conventional, centralised, one-way media model, such as, basically, the traditional media. We love the fact that people can watch the video, post comments, we reply to comments, it‚Äôs a two way dialogue, it‚Äôs a totally different culture\\". On 14 September 2013, Farrant and Nanni notified viewers that a copyright claim had been filed against the video for the parodic use of Farnham's \\"You're the Voice\\", despite protection for parody and satire under Part III: 41A and Part IV: 103AA of the Australian Copyright Act. On 26 October 2013, the duo uploaded a version without the parody, as an agreement with copyright holders had not been reached.  Relationship with RT network  Five episodes from the first season of Rap News were licensed to be distributed by RT via their website and YouTube channel. In January 2014 the producers of Rap News confirmed ten episodes from Season 2 would be licensed to RT for broadcast on both RT's television and YouTube channels. A brief excerpt about Bitcoin from Rap News 21 (The News) featured in episode 555 of The Keiser Report, a financial program presented by Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert which is broadcast on RT America. Reception As of November 2017, the YouTube channel hosting Rap News has received more than 17 million total video views; additionally the channel has over 118,000 subscribers. Rap News has been warmly received by organisations that advocate whistle-blowing including WikiLeaks and The Kindle Project. The Rap News videos‚Äîeither individually, or as a whole series‚Äîhave been featured on a large number of esoteric and fringe-view websites. (Examples:) = Rap News 5 (The War on Journalism) = Rap News 5 was 'video of the week' on an edition of Al- Jazeera's The Listening Post, which aired on 27 November 2010. A heavily edited version of RN5 (lasting just over 60 seconds) played out during the episode. = Rap News 15 (Big Brother is WWWatching You) = In a very brief article, Michael Kelly of Business Insider wrote about Rap News, saying \\"This Australian website calls out the immense rise in US domestic surveillance\\" and went on to describe the Rap News 15 segment as \\"informative and entertaining\\". Rap News 15 also came to the attention of American cryptographer and security expert Bruce Schneier, who posted a link to the video on his website, accompanied with text simply stating: \\"wow\\". = Rap News 19 (Whistleblower) = Australian Senator Scott Ludlam quoted verbatim a small excerpt from Rap News 19 to conclude a speech he was making in the Australian Senate regarding whistle-blowers. The exact portion he quoted was \\"Whistleblowers; they leak in the public interest. Now what remains to be known is - is the public interested? If so, this might be a good day to exhibit it! Ignorance is a choice, in the age of the internet.\\" = Rap News 20 (A Game of Polls) = See controversies. = Rap News 22 (The Energy Crisis) = Zachary Shahan of TreeHugger and CleanTechnica wrote two brief reviews of Rap News 22 in which he claimed to have \\"really enjoyed it and thought it was quite well done\\" but went on to say \\"while they are satirizing conspiracy theorists and global warming deniers, they probably reinforce the myths more than dispel them.\\" = Rap News 23 (Crimea Media Wars) = Rap News once again made The Listening Post's 'video of the week', with RN23. A two-minute extract from the Crimea Media Wars video was aired on 5 April edition of the program.

The film had its world premiere on 25 October 2012, at the Bram Stoker International Film Festival. It stars Dervla Kirwan, Charlotte Riley, and Branko Tomovic and centers upon a British reality show film crew that encounters a dark entity. Plot In 2010, a film crew for the British television show Darkest Secrets enter a remote Siberian forest known for the unexplained deaths of thirty-four unidentified people in 1998. The crew includes Kate Hansen, the host; Matt Hurst, the camera man; and David Hamilton, a tech. Ruth Peacock, a psychic, and Yuri Levkov, a Russian author, join them. After searching the woods for the site of the massacre, Ruth suddenly makes contact with several ghosts, who speak to her in Russian. In a vision, Ruth sees Russian military figures execute prisoners and is overwhelmed by the experience. Ruth tells them that they must go further east toward what Yuri says is an abandoned facility. On the way, Ruth sees more visions of Russian soldiers murdering helpless prisoners, this time at the facility, and she urges them onward. When they enter the facility, they hear distant, echoing screams. Ruth suggests that they turn back, but Kate convinces her to continue. Inside the facility, they discover cages and cells. Ruth once again hears Russian voices, and Yuri translates them as a warning to leave. When Ruth enters one of the rooms, visions of torture overwhelm her, and she says that the victims were psychics like her. An entity harasses them in a hallway, and Ruth tells them to remain calm, as it feeds off of their reactions. In one of the cells, Ruth detects a powerful psychic force, and she attempts to make contact with it; Yuri translates for her. Ruth identifies the presence as Mischka, a dead prisoner who was tortured by the soldiers. When Mischka turns hostile, they flee the cell and realize that David has gone missing. The group retreats to a control room, where they examine their footage. In it, they see fleeting images of both Mischka and David. Matt insists that they find David, but Ruth is exhausted and needs to rest. Before she falls asleep, Ruth says that Yuri has been here before. Yuri admits that he knew of the facility and its history of brutal military experiments on psychics, but he needed to know if Ruth was capable of finding it. When Kate hears David's voice, she and Matt go off to find him, and Yuri watches over Ruth as she sleeps. Mischka kills David in front of Matt and Kate, and they flee back to the control room. There, Yuri has taken Ruth hostage and demanded that she help him free the spirit of his lost girlfriend, whom he believes to have been killed here. As they go deeper into the facility, Mischka becomes increasingly hostile despite Ruth's attempts to communicate with him. Yuri sees the ghost of his girlfriend, but when he approaches her, Mischka savagely beats and kills him. Ruth orders Matt and Kate to leave the facility, and she tries once again to make contact with Mischka. As they're about to leave, Kate turns back to help Ruth, and Matt reluctantly follows. They find Ruth on the floor in Mischka's cell. Ruth weakly explains that she has helped Mischka to cross over, and the facility is now safe. Relieved, Kate and Matt split up to recover their equipment. After she sees suspicious footage of Ruth's battle with Mischka, Kate becomes concerned for Matt, only to find him dead. Ruth, possessed by Mischka, kills Kate. Kate then realizes that she and the rest of the crew are now doomed to forever wander through the facility with the rest of the ghosts. Cast * Dervla Kirwan as Ruth Peacock * Charlotte Riley as Kate Hansen * Branko Tomovic as Yuri Levkov * Rupert Hill as Matt Hurst * Oliver Jackson as David Hamilton * Michael David Worden as Mischka Production Shooting took place in Selby, North Yorkshire, England. Tomovic's character was originally a 50-year-old British professor, but the character was rewritten to be an Eastern European to better fit Tomovic. Hill shot most of the POV footage himself. Tomovic was cast after writer-director Stone saw him in Whitechapel.

Early life Parry was born at Holyhead, Anglesey, son of Benjamin Parry, who was employed as an engineer on ships sailing from Holyhead to Ireland. Educated at the Holyhead County School, he enrolled at the University College, Bangor, where he earned a first-class degree in History in 1929 and an MA in 1931 for a thesis on the attitude of Welsh Independents to working class movements from 1815-1870. Given the history of Aberdare, his research interests may have been a factor in his receiving a call from Siloa, Aberdare, where he was ordained in June 1933. He was only the third minister in the church's history, following David Price (1843‚Äì78) and D. Silyn Evans (1880-1930). In 1940, he married Mona Morgan, whose father, Richard, was a deacon at Siloa. Siloa, Aberdare Parry earned a reputation as a preacher at Aberdare, although his modern views on theology and the teaching of the Bible, clashed with the more traditional views of an older generation. He was invited to preach throughout Wales and at annual meetings both of his own denomination and other organizations. Parry also published a number of books and articles, in Welsh, mainly on various aspects of the history of nonconformity. He was also a noted local historian, who wrote a column for the local paper, the Aberdare Leader. Later life Possibly due to a decline in membership, Price's long pastorate at Siloa came to an end in 1964, when he became Head of Religious Studies at Aberdare Boys‚Äò Grammar School. Ifor Parry died on 18 December 1975, and he left a substantial sum of money to the Aberdare Boys‚Äò Grammar School to endow the ‚ÄòMona and Ifor Parry Trust Fund,‚Äô the income from which was to be used, in part, to award an annual prize for local history.

Early life and education  Macduff Everton was born on August 13, 1947 in Pearl River, New York to missionaries. Everton moved with his family to Oregon when he was one year old. He would eventually land in Santa Barbara, California when his father, Clyde, became a pastor at Trinity Episcopal Church. He attended Santa Barbara High School before leaving to explore the world. While hitchhiking on his journey at age 17, he picked up a camera on a Danish street abandoned by an American who didn't want to appear as a tourist; the resulting images were the first he was able to successfully sell in Japan. Everton returned to the United States at 19 years old and landed a job with an educational film company to create college-level archaeological and anthropological filmstrips in Latin America. This led to Everton's introduction to the Maya people in Mexico‚Äôs Yucat√°n Peninsula. To support his documentary projects about the Maya and their culture, he took seasonal jobs such as wrangler, muleteer, and white-water rafting river guide. Everton would spend six months at a time in the backcountry, then return to the Yucat√°n, and finally the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he earned a B.A. in 1981 from the College of Creative Studies and an M.F.A. in 1984 when he was in his mid-30s.  Career  Everton's first trip to the Yucat√°n was in 1967. His 1991 book, The Modern Maya: A Culture in Transition, shed light on the Maya people during globalization and critical change. In 2012, the University of Texas Press published The Modern Maya: Incidents of Travel and Friendship in Yucat√°n. He updated readers on the modern Maya people from his previous book and viewed the effects of racism, tourism, and drugs, among others. Everton has chronicled the lives of his Maya friends and their families over a 40-year span. As he wrote, \\"While most history chronicles the famous, this book is about the lives of ordinary people who are the soul of their culture.\\" Everton is also considered a master of panoramic photography. His magnum opus is his work with the living Maya on the Yucat√°n Peninsula. His appreciation of light and weather, coupled with his observational skills, have been attributed to his time living in rural areas. Through his photographs, Everton is able to shares a sense of place, whether portraits depict individuals or landscapes. Everton's works are in the public collections of Biblioth√®que nationale de France, British Museum, International Center of Photography, Museum of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e, and Museo de Arte Moderno. = Writings = He has contributed to several archaeological books by other authors, including The Code of Kings: The Language of Seven Sacred Mayan Temples and Tombs, Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path, and The Cities of Ancient Mexico: Reconstructing a Lost World. = Editorial work = Hired originally by editors for his fine art eye, Everton earned a reputation as a photographer who knew how to travel. He has previously worked with several print and online publications, including Cond√© Nast Traveler, Life, Los Angeles, The New York Times Magazine, Outside, and Smithsonian. He is a contributing editor and photographer at National Geographic Traveler, where he has photographed stories from Beijing to Big Sur.  Critical reception  Peter Galassi, director of photography at Museum of Modern Art, noted the playful creativity of Everton‚Äôs early artistic exploration: ‚ÄúMacduff Everton's series of fotoverigraphs is an unusually imaginative and witty piece of work. No academic could offer a more persuasive demonstration of the elasticity of photographic meaning -- or one so full of pleasure and surprise.‚Äù An early champion of his landscape portraiture, The New York Times photography critic and curator Andy Grundberg wrote, ‚ÄúMacduff Everton updates travel photography in the same way that Ansel Adams updated 19th century photography of the West. He captures strange and eloquent moments in which time, and the world, seem to stand still.‚Äù  Personal life  Everton lives in Santa Barbara, California. He married Mary Heebner, also a University of California, Santa Barbara College of Creative Studies alumna, in 1989. Past artistic collaborations include The Western Horizon and Patagonia, La √öltima Esperanza. They were featured in director Russ Spencer's Full Circle, a documentary about their collaboration on The Western Horizon.

This concept was originally proposed in the Latin American Association of Reproductive Health Researchers (ALIRH, 2013) in analogy of the epidemiological, demographic and nutritional transitions. Overview In the last two decades, the world has seen a substantial reduction of maternal mortality.(1) Considering that maternal mortality is vastly determined by social, societal and contextual factors, this reduction is important not only because of the number of lives that have been spared in this period (an estimated 2,000,000 between 1990 and 2010), but because it denotes that the world is making progress towards development and gender equality.(1,2) However, this progress is still insufficient, unequal and slow: recent estimates suggest that 287,000 women died of causes related to pregnancy and childbirth in 2010. Maternal mortality remains a global tragedy, but the observed progress inspires the international community to believe and strive for the elimination of maternal mortality in the decades to come.(3) The vast majority of maternal deaths is avoidable and takes place in developing countries. In developed countries, the maternal mortality ratio can be as low as 10 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births while among the least developed countries it can be as a high as 1,000 maternal deaths or more per 100,000 live births.(4) This disparity is also observed within countries and when the population is disaggregated in quintiles of income or education.(5-7) Thus, countries, regions within countries and different population groups within country experience a specific momentum in a dynamic process of reduction of maternal mortality, which may benefit from specific approaches. In 1929, Thompson described the phenomenon of demographic transition characterized by a gradual shift from a pattern of high mortality and high fertility to a pattern of low mortality and low fertility.(8) Omram (1971) described the epidemiologic transition, with a shift from a pattern of high prevalence of communicable diseases to a pattern of high prevalence of non-communicable diseases.(9) Finally, Poppkin (1993) proposed the nutritional transition model, which helps to understand the transformations in human diets and the global epidemic of obesity.(10) These transitions and other socioeconomic and cultural changes (e.g. globalization, urbanization) led us to develop the concept of ‚Äúobstetric transition‚Äù (11). Concept As a result of the Millennium Development Goals Project, improved data related to maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity became available for the period between 1990 and 2010. Altogether, these data reflect a secular trend where countries are gradually shifting from a pattern of high maternal mortality to low maternal mortality, from direct obstetric causes of maternal mortality to indirect causes, moving from the natural history of pregnancy and childbirth to institutionalization of maternity care, medicalization and over medicalization, and aging of maternal population. This is the ‚Äúobstetric transition‚Äù phenomenon, which has implications for the strategies aimed at reducing maternal mortality. Figure 1 presents trends of maternal mortality by world region for the period 1990 to 2010 derived from recent estimates (2). Considering that countries and world regions are transitioning in the same pathway towards elimination of maternal deaths, five stages can be devised. Countries are experiencing this transition at different paces, and have started this process in different moments of their history (e.g. most developed countries started their transitions more than a century ago, while some developing countries have started their transition much more recently). Classification In the Stage I (MMR> 1,000 / 100,000) most women are experiencing a situation close to the natural history of pregnancy and childbirth, with very little being done ‚Äì if anything at all ‚Äì to reduce the risk of maternal mortality at the population level. Considering 2010 data, Chad and Somalia are countries that could illustrate this stage. Hopefully, as time passes (and progress occurs), no country will remain in this stage. Stage I is characterized by very high maternal mortality, high fertility and the predominance of direct causes of maternal deaths together with a substantial proportion of deaths attributable to communicable diseases such as malaria. In the Stage II (MMR: 999 ‚Äì 300) mortality and fertility remain very high, with a similar pattern of causes as compared to the Stage I. However, a greater proportion of women in the population are being able to somewhat detach from the natural history of pregnancy and childbirth. Several countries in the Sub- Saharan Africa could illustrate the Stage II. For Stages I and II, the main issue is access to care. In general, these are countries with a substantial lack of basic infrastructure (such as roads, transportation, health facilities), very low education levels (particularly female literacy), weak health systems, severe shortages of skilled birth attendants and low capacity to deliver essential life-saving interventions. In this context, poor quality of care functions as deterrent for generating demand for health services. In countries in these stages, focus should be directed to creating the basic infra-structure and implement maternal-mortality primary prevention measures (e.g. family planning, iron supplementation, insecticide treated nets, intersectorial measures to remove barriers to access the health system). As the minimal infra-structure is created, health services should strive to deliver quality care in order to become a sensible alternative to pregnant women (demand generation). (21) In the obstetric transition, the tipping point occurs in the Stage III. In this stage the mortality is still high (MMR 299 ‚Äì 100 maternal deaths / 100,000 live births), the fertility is variable and direct causes of mortality still predominates. This is a complex stage because access remain an issue for a great deal of the population, but as a large proportion of pregnant women are indeed reaching health facilities, quality of care becomes a major determinant of health outcomes. Not only primary prevention is important, but also secondary and tertiary prevention are critical for improving maternal health outcomes in this stage. In other words, quality of care, with skilled birth attendance and appropriate management of complications and disabilities, is essential to reduce maternal mortality. India, Guatemala and South Africa are countries that could illustrate this stage. In the Stage IV (MMR <50 maternal deaths / 100,000 live births), the maternal mortality is moderate or low, there is low fertility and the indirect causes of maternal mortality, particularly the non-communicable diseases, acquire greater importance. In order to further advance the reduction of maternal mortality, the main issue becomes quality of care and elimination of delays within health systems. Another aspect that emerges in this stage is the growing role of over medicalization as a threat to quality and improved health outcomes. Various Asian countries and most Latin American countries have joined developed countries in this stage. In the Stage V, all avoidable maternal deaths are indeed avoided. The maternal mortality rate is very low, the fertility is low or very low, and the non-communicable diseases are the main causes of maternal mortality. As this is an aspirational, largely theoretical stage at the moment, the maternal mortality levels remain uncertain, but could be lower than 5 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The main issue in this stage would be the sustainability of excellence in quality of care. It is worth noting that the main purpose of this framework is to illustrate different phases of a dynamic process and offer a rational for different focus and solutions for reducing mortality according to the stage in the obstetric transition. The ranges of maternal mortality ratio uses to define the proposed stages of obstetric transition are frequently in country stratification, (2, 16) but the boundaries between these stages are somewhat imprecise and one stage tends to fade into another. Progression is not always linear and, largely due to equity issues, different stages often co-exist in the same country.

Honda sponsors Thai riders to compete in Grand Prix motorcycle racing (WorldGP), particularly Moto2 class such as Ratthapark Wilairot, Somkiat Chantra,Thitipong Warokorn. Thailand's motorcycle market =History= In the period 1986‚Äì1988, the motorcycle market in Thailand sold roughly 200,000 bikes per year. Yamaha and Kawasaki were the market leaders. Honda was third, with a 22% market share. Its reputation in Thailand before the decade of the 1990s was poor. Things changed in 1989 with the introduction of the \\"Nova\\", a two-stroke bike that Honda rode to sales leadership in 1989. Honda had forecast sales of 2,000‚Äì3,000 Novas per month, but 10,000 per month became the sales norm. In 1997, Honda faced ending production of two-stroke engines at its plant in Lat Krabang. But in 1997, the 1997 Asian financial crisis struck, causing Thais to economise, and the new four-stroke \\"Wave\\" and \\"Dream\\" models became popular as they used less fuel than two-strokes. =Current= Thailand motorcycle sales surpassed two million bikes for the first time in 2011, hitting 2.01 million. Sales rose to 2.13 million units in 2012, the highest level ever, before dropping to two million in 2013. In 2014, the market fell by 15% to 1.7 million due to political turmoil and delayed payments for farmers under the rice-pledging scheme. Thailand's motorcycle sales in 2015 totaled 1.68 million bikes, down one percent from 2014. In the first four months of 2016, 559,915 motorcycles were sold, down 3.8% for the same period in 2015. In 2018, overall motorcycle and motorbike sales in Thailand totaled 1,789,000 units, down 1.2% from 2017. The market is expected to decline further in 2019, to 1.76 million units. The motorcycle market in 2018 saw 1.79 million units sold, with Honda selling 1.4 million. Honda has enjoyed the largest share of the local motorcycle market for 30 years.

History From 2 September 1928 to 1978 the line was part of the East Coast Main Trunk line from Hamilton. With the opening of the Kaimai tunnel in 1978, the terminus of the East Coast Main Trunk line was changed to Kawerau and the section of line between Hawkens Junction and TƒÅneatua became the TƒÅneatua Branch line. This line across the Rangitaiki Plains follows an inland or southerly route to avoid areas which were swampy at the time of construction, therefore bypassing WhakatƒÅne, the largest town in the area. The intention was for the line to be extended from TƒÅneatua to Opotiki, then onwards east to connect with the isolated Gisborne Section line from Gisborne. Some construction work was carried out beyond TƒÅneatua towards Opotiki in 1928, and an opening ceremony was held for the new line (the ECMT) in Tauranga on 28 March. : and on building the Paeroa‚ÄìPokeno Line in 1938, when the Minister of Public Works Bob Semple on 28 January turned the first sod ; it was said that the proposed line would shorten the distance from Auckland to towns on the ECMT by nearly . However work was stopped in July 1928 when the Government of the day transferred the construction workers to the Rotorua-Taupo line which it had just approved the construction of. However, as late as 1939 ¬£45,000 was provided for extension from Taneatua to Opotiki. Various routes were investigated and surveyed to link the difficult section between TƒÅneatua and Moutohora, but all were found to be difficult and expensive. Following the Great Depression, World War 2 and the greater availability of road vehicles in the period after the war, the proposal was subsequently dropped and TƒÅneatua remained the eastern terminus of the railway line in the Bay of Plenty. Gisborne was subsequently linked to the south with Wellington by way of Napier and Palmerston North with the Palmerston North ‚Äì Gisborne Line in 1942. The isolated Gisborne Section line became the Moutohora Branch line, which closed in 1959. The line to TƒÅneatua was run as the end section of the East Coast Main Trunk from 1928 to 1978. Freight services continued to be operated on the line until 2001. A passenger service was provided on the line with the Taneatua Express from Auckland between 1928 and 1959. In 1959 railcars replaced this service, but the new railcar services only operated between Auckland and Te Puke, due to negligible passenger traffic between Te Puke and TƒÅneatua. The Whakatane Board Mills Line, a private line, was built and operated by the Whakatane Board Mills from Awakeri to their mill in 1939 to serve their large operation. This line was privately operated by the mill until 1999 when the then national rail operator Tranz Rail, took over the operation of the line. Tranz Rail discontinued operating the line in 2001 and the line was closed in 2003, together with the mothballing of the entire TƒÅneatua Branch line. In 2015 a rail cart operation, Awakeri Rail Advertures, was established on the section of the line between Awakeri and Rewatu Road.

It was classified as Deep Depression BOB 06 by the IMD on 19 November. As it was moving on a very slow northwest direction on 20 November, it became Cyclonic Storm Helen as it brought light to heavy rainfall in eastern India. It then became a Severe Cyclonic Storm on the afternoon hours of 21 November. Meteorological history Late on 17 November, the remnant energy of Tropical Storm Podul contributed to the development of a trough over the Bay of Bengal, located near the Andaman Islands. During the next couple of days, the storm slowly organized and consolidated, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) during the early hours of 19 November. Later on the same day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgraded the storm to a depression, classifying it as BOB 06, followed by the JTWC reporting that the storm had reached Tropical Storm strength. A couple of hours later, the IMD upgraded BOB 06 into a Deep Depression, as the storm continued to intensify. The storm slowly drifted west-northwestward, while deep convection consolidated around the system's well-defined center of circulation. In the early hours of 20 November, the IMD classified BOB 06 as a Cyclonic Storm, thereby officially naming it Helen. Early on 21 November, Helen continued to intensify into a Severe Cyclonic Storm, reaching its peak intensity of with a central pressure of . Shortly before landfall, the storm's convection sheared to the north, causing its low level circulation to fully expose followed by the JTWC issuing its final bulletin, reporting that the storm had weakened due to land interaction. Helen made landfall south of Machilipatnam, Andhra Pradesh and rapidly deteriorated into a deep depression. Preparations and Impact The Andhra Pradesh government alerted all coastal districts of the state, especially southern coastal districts. The district collectors were directed to evacuate people from low-lying areas near the coast. More than 11,000 people were evacuated from the areas affected by the storm. Ten teams of the National Disaster Response Force were deployed for rescue operations in the affected areas. A total of 10 deaths have been reported in incidents related to the cyclone.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cyclone-Helen-wreaks- havoc-in-Andhra-10-die/articleshow/26224697.cms Three boats carrying 20 fishermen were reported missing, out of which two were reported to be safe and on their way back to the coast. Efforts are on to ensure the safety of the third. The Coast Guard's vessel Avantibai and an HAL Chetak helicopter of the Navy have been dispatched for search and rescue of the missing fishermen. Helen brought extensive damage to Machilipatnam in Krishna district, with uprooted trees and electric lines. The districts of Krishna, East Godavari and Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam and Guntur suffered heavy rainfall. Heavy damage to harvest crops was also reported, with the West Godavari district being worst affected. Paddy, coconut and banana crops have suffered damage.

Jung graduated from Korea University in 1950. Jung Hansuk also served in executive capacity for a number of literary organizations: he was at various times the vice president of Korean Fiction Writers‚Äô Association, director of Korean Culture and Arts Foundation, and president of The Korean Academy of the Arts. Work In his works of fiction, Jung Hansuk experimented with a variety of subject matters and techniques in order to create portraits of Korean people in the changing world of post-war Korean society. A serious social problem he investigated with particular adroitness and sensitivity is one of generation gap; ‚ÄúAn Old House‚Äù (Goga, 1956), a story of young people seeking to escape from the traditional family system, skillfully explores this conflict between generations against the backdrop of war-torn Korea. Despite the fact that the world Jung Hansuk sketches in his fiction is fraught with moral deterioration accompanying extreme material privation, he maintains an ethical stance toward it and emphasizes the need to aspire to the ideal. These characteristics are evident in his early stories as well, such as ‚ÄúAdam‚Äôs Journey‚Äù (Adamui haengno) and ‚ÄúA Madwoman‚Äù (Gwangnyeo), both published in 1952, and ‚ÄúBetrayal‚Äù (Baesin) which appeared the following year. ‚ÄúA Story of Jeonhwangdang‚Äôs Book of Seal Imprints‚Äù explores the tensions between past traditions and contemporary reality in yet another way; gentle nostalgia for the world of classicism and beauty suffuses this story of a master seal engraver whose craft can no longer find an appreciative audience. The work effectively juxtaposes classical language of literati with the vulgar idiom of daily life. Furthermore, Jung Hansuk has written historical fictions such as Geumdang byeokhwa, Lee Seonggye, and Nongae. Starting in mid-1980s, Jung also published works of poetry.Source-attribution\\"Jung Hansuk\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Jung was recipient of the Korean Academy of the Arts Award (1986) and the March First Culture Award (1988).

Han graduated from Seoul National University with a Linguistics degree and worked in an advisory capacity in the Department of Public Reports. She was also a lecturer at Seoul National University's Music School. Her literary debut was in 1956 with two of her short stories (\\"The Season in Starlight\\" and \\"Precipice of a Myth\\") that were published in the Contemporary Literature Journal at the suggestion of Kim Dong-ni.\\"Han Mahlsook\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Han was also a member of the UNESCO Korean Committee. Malsook is married to gayageum musician Hwang Byungki and their eldest son is mathematician Jun-Muk Hwang. Work With vivid imagery, inventive writing style and keen perception, Han Malsook captures the multifaceted interiority of alienated human beings, in particular, the psychology of contemporary women in the postwar setting. Her major work, ‚ÄúA Precipice of Myth‚Äù (Sinhwaui danae, 1960), utilizes existentialist perspective to probe the damaged psychology of a woman whose denial of conventional ethics and the very idea of future allows her to lead a temporal existence defined solely by pursuit of pleasure and comfort. A story that embodies the postwar atmosphere of self-abandonment and nihilistic approach to life, it won the author instant recognition and became the main subject of existentialist discussion in the latter half of 1950's. Han explored these views further in ‚ÄúA Promise with God‚Äù (Singwaui yaksok, 1968). The story features a woman who bargains with God for her daughter's life, but realizes after her daughter's recovery that she cannot embrace faith in God as she had promised. For the protagonist, the object of her dedication remains her daughter, not God.

In Roman times it was in the province of Lusitania within the Conventus Iuridicus Emeritensis, whose capital was Colonia Augusta Emerita (modern day M√©rida). It was approached via the Roman road known as the V√≠a de la Plata and is now permanently abandoned. It is said to have been a pre-Roman city, although this remains unconfirmed and has been questioned by some authors, on the grounds that the flat location did not meet the defensive requirements of a pre-Roman town and only a few pottery remains have been found.R√≠o-Miranda Alc√≥n, J.

The walled city covered an area of approximately 15-16 hectares,Rio-Miranda, J. 2011, p,23-60 although it is known that in the area northwest of the city there were many houses, so that the settled area is thought to have been much larger than the walled area. The city was smaller and less important than some other Roman cities of the Iberian peninsula, but was among the main population centres between the Tagus river and the Sierra de Gredos, along with Caurium (Coria), Augustobriga (Talavera la Vieja) and Egitania (Idanha-a-Velha). Its urban organisation corresponds to an orthogonal plan, with the V√≠a de la Plata as the principal axis, passing through the city in a north-south direction.In excavations, milestones have been discovered in C√°parra and we know that those in the neighbourhood were repaired under the emperors: * Tiberius: Rio-Miranda, J. 2011, pp. 121-122; Ahigal, 2000, pp, 4-6; 2005, p.12.

The example illustrated is in the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and is a gift of Samuel Putnam Avery.  The print  Letter to Samuel Putnam Avery from Mary Cassatt, Brooklyn Museum The infant is Cassatt's nephew Joseph Gardner Cassatt III by her brother Gard and sister-in-law Eugenie Carter (Jennie). Cassatt's biographer Nancy M. Mathews dates the print as executed in 1888. Cassatt painted several portraits of Jennie, but only one quick drypoint sketch of Gard exists, probably executed at the same time as this print of Jennie and the baby. There are at least two other portraits of the young Gardner, of which one is the pastel Gardner and Ellen Mary Cassatt in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cassatt came into conflict with her sister-in-law over women's suffrage. Nancy Mathews estimates Cassatt as unquestionably feminist from an early age, but described her feminism as a private, nuanced position that would not allow her to organise exhibitions in pursuit of the feminist cause. Although she did not join any groups advocating women's suffrage she did nevertheless support it, and allowed her friend Louisine Havemeyer, a committed and active feminist, to organise a 1915 exhibition of hers and Edgar Degas's work, together with a selection of Old Masters, at an exhibition at the Knoedler Gallery, New York, in support of the cause. However Eugenie was anti-suffrage, a position that Cassatt could not understand, and Eugenie and family, along with Philadelphia society in general, boycotted the show. Cassatt responded by selling off her work that would otherwise have gone to her heirs. This example of the Gardner print was, however, already in the collection of Samuel Putnam Avery, the American connoisseur and art dealer, a personal friend of Cassatt's and one of her most active collectors who went on to donate his entire collection of 17,775 etchings and lithographs to the New York Public Library in 1900. Cassatt considered herself a painter and not a draftsman, but she was an accomplished printmaker. The medium did not come naturally to her, but she was inevitably caught up in what came to be known as the Etching Revival championed by her Impressionist friends. Her mentor Edgar Degas, whose pastels so inspired her, was working with artists such as Henri Gu√©rard (husband of Eva Gonzal√®s, another woman painter in the Impressionist circle) to develop more \\"painterly\\" effects in printmaking. During the fall and winter of 1879‚Äì80 Cassatt worked by day at Degas' studio, which was equipped with a small etching press, acquiring her technique, while her evenings were spent on drawings to be transferred to the etching plate next day. These drawing were of domestic scenes as well as of the theatre scenes associated with her. By 1885 Cassatt had begun to work exclusively in drypoint, a spare and restrained technique worked directly on the plate with the aid of a specially hardened drypoint needle, concentrating on line rather than the \\"brush\\" technique she had formerly sought. Later still, inspired by Japanese prints that had been exhibited in Paris, she turned her attention back to the aquatint process, a print process that emulates the watercolorist's wash, exhibiting in 1891 a series of ten highly original colored drypoint and aquatint prints, including Woman Bathing and In the Omnibus. Adelyn D. Breeskin, Cassatt's most noted historian and the author of two catalogue raisonn√©s of her work, notes that these colored prints, \\"now stand as her most original contribution... adding a new chapter to the history of graphic arts...technically, as color prints, they have never been surpassed\\". In all Cassatt executed just 22 color prints. An example of Woman Bathing fetched $218,500 at a Christie's sale in October 2010. The 1888 Gardner print is generally regarded as the earliest dated example of the mother and child images that grew into Cassatt's greatest body of work, approaching a third of her entire opus. There had been earlier examples of the theme, notably Mother About To Wash Her Sleepy Child (probably the very earliest example) that she showed at the Fifth Impressionist Exhibition of 1880, but it was this print that ushered in what was to become her signature theme.

The advancement of science and technology has become an integral part of economic planning in South Korea. Fast-growing industries have created a massive demand for new and more advanced technologies. Additionally, Korean scientists propose that the advancement of science and technology in partnership with North Korea could help facilitate the peaceful reunification of North Korea and South Korea. In the pursuit of advancement, South Korea has taken a centralized approach.  Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies (KOFST)  The Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies was established in 1966 and consists of 780 organizations as of 2012. The goals of the KOFST are to make the sharing of technology and research data between these societies easier and to encourage and facilitate the cooperation of Pacific Rim countries. Aerospace Engineering A replica of the Naro-1 South Korea has sent up 10 satellites from 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia.

Companies involved in the aerospace and defense markets of South Korea are primarily large multinational companies. These large companies have been further strengthened by a push towards consolidation in the market. This results in a difficulty for newer companies to enter the South Korean aerospace market.  Defense Technology  Due to the growing perceived threat of North Korea, South Korea is increasing defense spending. In 2019, South Korea is expected to increase spending by the largest amount in 11 years. Hanwha Techwin is a leading South Korean company manufacturing defense products, security devices, engines, digital solutions, and integrated control systems in South Korea. Hanwha Techwin produces video recorders, surveillance software, access control products, and intelligent machinery and solutions. Biotechnology Since the 1980s, the South Korean government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry, and the sector is projected to grow to by 2010. The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics. Recently, research and development in genetics and cloning has received increasing attention, with the first successful cloning of a dog, Snuppy (in 2005), and the cloning of two females of an endangered species of wolves by the Seoul National University in 2007.

Controversies  BMus external examiner In 2008, the BBC obtained e-mails circulated within Kingston's School of Music, relating to the opinions of an external examiner moderating the BMus course. The messages showed that her final report caused considerable concern within the department. The examiner was persuaded to moderate her criticism following contact from a member of the University's staff. The e-mails also detailed a plan to replace her (at the end of her term) with a more experienced and broad-based external examiner, a process which Kingston stressed breaks no rules relating to the appointment of such examiners. In October 2008, Peter Williams, Chief Executive of the UK Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), presented the agency's findings to a Parliamentary Select Committee charged with investigating standards in British higher education. Following an investigation of the allegations by a former University staff member that undue pressure was applied to the School of Music's External Examiner, QAA upheld all charges of wrongdoing, as alleged. Controversial speakers In 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron named and shamed four British universities which gave platforms to allegedly 'extremist' speakers.British universities that give the floor to extremist speakers are named and shamed, The Telegraph Kingston's Vice Chancellor Julius Weinberg defended his decision to allow controversial speakers in the name of free speech.I won't stop offering a platform to so-called 'hate speakers', The Guardian National Student Survey exaggeration In 2008, an audio recording obtained by student media included two psychology lecturers asking students to inflate their graded opinions given as part of the National Student Survey. One member of staff was recorded as encouraging students to boost specific satisfaction scores, because \\"if Kingston comes down the bottom [of the league tables], then the bottom line is that nobody is going to want to employ you because they are going to think your degree is shit\\". In response, Vice-Chancellor Peter Scott confirmed that the recording was genuine but added that he believed that the incident was an isolated one. In July 2008, the Higher Education Funding Council of England removed the University's Department of Psychology of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from the League Tables for the year as its sanction for having fraudulently manipulated the National Student Survey results.

Biography  Liddle attended the Nottingham College of Art from around 1957-59 and studied drawing and art history under John Powell and smithing under the silversmith G.K. Kitson. Liddle befriended fellow students Keith Albarn and his partner, Hazel. After studying, Liddle lived for a time in London where he married the Marshal Scholar Patricia Moyer. He also struck up a close friendship with the adult educationalist, Frank Turk, learning much from his experience of eastern spirituality. The pair met regularly and maintained a correspondence long after Peter left Cornwall and up until Frank's death in 1996. However, with the end of his first marriage in 1969, Peter left Cornwall and after a period of instability settled in the Lake District in 1971. He remarried in 1972 to Sandra Stone (b. 1950) and together they had two children Sorrel (Stratford) 1973 and Jude 1975. Peter never fell in with a particular school after leaving Cornwall but exhibited at times with other artists represented by Godfrey Pilkington's renowned Piccadilly Gallery in the 70s and 80s. Art While still living in London Liddle began painting the Cornish coast, three paintings from this period were selected for the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1965. Later that year Peter and Patricia relocated to a studio in Cornwall where he began to experiment with acrylic paint, exhibiting regularly with both The Newlyn Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts. Two of his closest peers while in Cornwall were the painters Margo Maeckelberghe and Jack Pender. During this five-year period Liddle's style changed completely. He credits the challenge of the incredible Portholland light in his transition from heavy, textured, oils to whiter, more transparent, acrylics. Liddle is a British painter known for his allegorical depictions of the wild reaches of the British Isles. His paintings can be austere and unsettling, often hinting at something beyond the landscape they superficially represent. The award-winning author Sarah Hall has described the atavistic quality of his work as such, \\"He seems able to lay this place bare, restore it to its original form, its ancientness, its soul. Mountain ranges often seem prehistoric, or like dinosaur relics.\\" When Liddle talks about his work, he frequently asserts that experience of nature and particularly stone, is core to his practice. He has been quoted as saying, \\"My purpose in life seems to have been to record adventures.\\" He has exhibited nationally, including at the Royal Academy, and internationally. His work is held in public collections including both the Leicestershire County Council Art Collection and the Otter Gallery, University of Chichester. He has regularly appeared in the Cumbria Life publication and has also featured on several regional and national television programmes.

It is one of the few remaining structures built to serve the lumbering industry, which was Michigan's predominant industry in the 19th century. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History Charles Mears c 1856 Charles Mears was born in 1814 in North Billerica, Massachusetts, the son of Nathan and Lucy Mears. In 1836, Charles and his brothers Edwin and Nathan opened a general store in Paw Paw, Michigan. The next year, Charles and another brother, Albert, began considering starting business along the west shore of Lake Michigan. Realizing the potential of the lumber trade, Charles purchased land near White Lake, Michigan, and by early 1838 had opened a sawmill nearby. Mears decided that the then small village of Chicago would be a good market for timber, and he commissioned a lumber sloop to haul lumber from his mill to Chicago. In 1844, Mears established a second sawmill, and soon controlled timberland and owned mills across Michigan. Mears built a number of boardinghouses for his workers, as did other lumbermen. However, other lumbermen tended to build crude boardinghouses strictly for he mill hands. However, Mears's mills were close to Lake Michigan, and a fair amount of traffic passed. Thus, uniquely, Mears opened his boardinghouses to the general public. To attract public customers, the boardinghouses themselves were also of higher quality construction. This boardinghouse was constructed in 1866. When the lumbering trade declined, Mears continued to operate the boardinghouse to serve the public, with his former mill foreman as the innkeeper. Mears died in 1895, and passed the boardinghouse to his daughter, Carrie Ellen Mears. She closed the boardinghouse, but retained ownership until her own death in 1957. At that time, she bequeathed the boardinghouse and surrounding land to the state of Michigan. Part of the bequest became Mears State Park, and part was added to Silver Lake State Park. Other portions were sold, including the lot on which this boardinghouse sits. The building was renovated and reopened to the public. Description The Charles Mears Silver Lake Boardinghouse is a two-story, rectangular structure measuring by , with a one-story wing kitchen measuring by connected to one side. The exterior is covered with clapboard, and the roof with asphalt shingles. The windows are two-over-two double hung. On the interior, walls are lath and plaster, and the floors are of wood. There are four rooms on the main floor, two of which are large public rooms (one a sitting room and one a dining room). The two smaller rooms were originally used by the innkeeper. There are three more rooms in the kitchen wing: a kitchen, pantry, and storage room. The upper floor contains one large bunkroom for use by the mill hands and six smaller bedrooms for travelers.

Plot The movie is an entertaining and a cinematic journey of a morally stricken chief minister who works efficiently and actively to help a beleaguered elderly singer who is yet to receive the government allotted flat applied for eight long years ago! The story line depicts originality of characters such as the chief minister, his wife, his PA, the principal secretary and many personnel from the assembly. Story revolves within the time period of afternoon 3 PM to 6 AM dawn during which it highlights the political decision making process and also gives us an insight to the unending mind games between politicians and bureaucrats within the government system. Political movies, until now have shown people striving for the chair and power, but 'Aajcha Divas Majha' defines the hard stand taken up by a conscientious chief minister fighting to keep the self-esteem alive!

Hyun graduated from Jeju University and then Hanyang University's Graduate School. Hyun was a professor of Korean Language and Literature at Hanyang University. Work Hyun's work can not be separated from his birthplace, Jeju-do, the largest island of Korea. Hyun's Jeju-do was not a vacation destination, but the land of the first mass rebellion after the Korean national division. Hyun visited and re-visited the events of the time, and the scars that they caused. The stories contained in his first collection, The Dream of Pegasus (Yongma ui kkum, 1984), deal specifically with the traumatic historical event remembered as ‚ÄúApril 3rd Uprising‚Äù, in which masses of ordinary civilians were slaughtered by the police in an attempt to rout communists. Hyun tries to reinvestigate this event and properly mourn the death of innocent people in order to console their hovering spirits. Often it is the unique customs and folklore of Jeju Island that suggests a way toward healing: ‚ÄúThe Journal of Gwangjeong Pavilion‚Äù (Gwangjeong dang gi, ) and ‚ÄúCeremony on the Last Day of the Month‚Äù utilize the traditional legend of a ‚Äústrong woman‚Äù to describe the hope people of Jeju harbor for the return of a hero who will save them from the tyranny of politicians and bureaucrats. Hyun was also concerned with ideological or historical distortions of truth. Private truth is to be privileged over official accounts; The Skin and the Inner Flesh (Kkeop-jil gwa soksal, 1993) employs the sustained metaphor of surface and depth to characterize the relationship between official, often ideologically manipulated versions of ‚Äútruth‚Äù and enduring human truths buried beneath.

The red dot is the stream's source and blue dot is its mouth. Little Mahanoy Creek is a tributary of Mahanoy Creek in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. It starts in the borough of Frackville and joins Mahanoy Creek in the borough of Gordon. Its one named tributary is Rattling Run. The creek's watershed has an area of . Its watershed is not affected by mining. Compounds found in the waters of the creek include nitrogen, phosphorus, orthophosphates, phosphates, nitrates, and ammonia. Course Little Mahanoy Creek looking upstream in its lower reaches in Gordon Little Mahanoy Creek starts in Frackville and heads westward past a pond or small lake. It then drops steeply through a steep narrow valley between Ashland Mountain and Broad Mountain, which abruptly widens out a short distance downstream. The creek then flows on the northern edge of Broad Mountain to the borough of Gordon, where it picks up Rattling Run before flowing into Mahanoy Creek. =Tributaries= Rattling Run flows into Little Mahanoy Creek in Gordon, not far from Little Mahanoy Creek's mouth. It rises from springs on the slopes of Broad Mountain. Watershed The watershed of Little Mahanoy Creek has an area of . Areas in the watershed include the southern side of Ashland Mountain between Frackville and the creek's mouth. Geography and geology Little Mahanoy Creek flows through a valley between Ashland Mountain and Broad Mountain. The valley is very steep and narrow near the creek's headwaters, but becomes broader further downstream, being close to wide at the mouth. The creek lies over a layer of red shale. Below the shale is a layer of hard and compact sandstone, which has some black, carbon- containing matter in it. Hydrology Little Mahanoy Creek is one of the only tributaries of Mahanoy Creek that is not affected by mining in the area. The other is Schwaben Creek. The average discharge of Little Mahanoy Creek, as measured in late 2008 and early 2009 2.3 cubic feet per second and 14.9 cubic feet per second, with an average of 8.02 cubic feet per second. The discharge steadily increased between September 2008 and April 2009. In the same time period, the water temperature ranged between and . The average temperature during that time was . The measurement in September 2008 was the highest and the measurement in March 2009 was the lowest. The electrical conductivity of the creek 0.169 to 0.295 thousandths of a siemens. The average conductivity was 0.238 thousands of a siemens. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the waters of Little Mahanoy Creek ranged between 9.8 milligrams per liter and 11.8 milligrams per liter in late 2008 and early 2009. The average concentration was 11.2 milligrams per liter. The creek is typically alkaline, with pH levels ranging from 7.4 in late 2008 to 8.1 in March 2009. The average pH level between September 2008 and April 2009 was 7.6. In late 2008 and early 2009, the concentration of suspended sediment ranged from 2 to 9 milligrams per liter, with an average of 4.5 milligrams per liter. The total concentration of suspended solids in the creek was usually less than 5 milligrams per liter, but was 6 milligrams per liter on April 16, 2009. The total concentration of orthophosphates in Mahanoy Creek between September 2008 and April 2009 ranged from 0.029 to 0.112, with an average of 0.055 milligrams per liter. The concentration consistently decreased between late 2008 and early 2009.

The concentration of ammonia was consistently less than 0.02 milligrams per liter between November 2008 and April 2009. History A sawmill was built on Little Mahanoy Creek in 1814. In 1875, the borough of Ashland purchased a tract of land on the creek in Butler Township, two miles downstream of the creek's headwaters. In 1882, some people attempted to pump water from Little Mahanoy Creek to create a reservoir and pipe the water to those who needed it. Little Mahanoy Creek was polluted in 1915. Around that time, it was a source of water for the borough of Ashland. In 1936, the Frackville Sewerage Company attempted to create a sewer in Frackville, but after a controversy about paying for the sewer, it was stopped, causing the pumphouse to discharge into Little Mahanoy Creek. A number of local court cases resulted from this. Discharging sewage into the creek was banned by 1938. In 2011, there was an Easter egg drop in Little Mahanoy Creek. There were plans to make it an annual tradition. Fauna Little Mahanoy Creek is a trout stream. It can be fished in year-round. The trout are stocked in the creek. For instance, 600 trout were stocked in 2001. Rainbow trout have also historically been observed in the creek. In 1906, there were 800 fish in the creek, including juvenile fish, yearling fish, and adult fish.

Intercity mobility Waves of migration due to displacement by war, or exploitation in the hope of geographical discoveries could be observed in the past, however with new technological advancements in transportation keep making it easier and cheaper to get to one place from another. With intercontinental flights we even can travel to another continent, on a business trip for instance, and come back within a few hours. Not only time but road networks and flight networks are being used more and more intensively also, and there is an increasing need to describe the patterns of human peoples' mobility and their effect on network usage, whether the network is a transportation, communication or some other type of network. The radiation model Radiation models appeared first in physics to study the process of energetic particles or waves travel through vacuum. The model in the social science describes the flows of people between different locations. Daily commuting is the major part of the flows, so modeling job seeking has to be an important part of the model and so it is in the radiation model. People look for jobs in every county starting with their own home county. The number of open jobs n_\\\\text{jobs} depends on the size of the resident population n . The potential employment opportunity (e.g. conditions, income, working hour, etc.) is z with the distribution of p(z). Then, for each county n/n_\\\\text{jobs} job opportunities are assigned, which are random draws from the p(z) distribution. Individuals then chooses the job which is closest to their home county and provides the highest z. Thus, they take into account the proximity to their home county and the benefits it can provide. This optimization gives the migration flows (called commuting fluxes) between counties across the country. This is analogous to the model in physics that describes the radiation and absorption process, that's why it's called the radiation model. An important feature of the model is that the average flux between two counties does not depend on the benefit distribution, the number of job opportunities and the total number of commuters. The fundamental equation of the radiation model gives the average flux between two counties, :\\\\langle T_{ij}\\\\rangle = T_i\\\\frac{m_i n_j}{(m_i+s_{ij})(m_i + n_{j} + s_{ij})}. where T_i is the total number of commuters from county i, m_i and n_j are the population in county i and j respectively, and s_{ij} is the total population in the circle centered at i and touching j excluding the source and the destination population. The model is not static as the Gravity model, and has clear implications which can be empirically verified. =Example= The population density around Utah is much lower than around Alabama and so are the job opportunities, given that the population of the two states is the same. Thus, the fundamental equation implies that people from Utah have to travel further to find suitable jobs on average than people from Alabama, and indeed, this is what the data shows. The Gravity model gives bad predictions both on short and long distance commuting, while the prediction of the Radiation model is close to the census data. Further empirical testing shows that the Radiation model underestimates the flow in case of big cities, but generalizing the fundamental equation the model can give at least as good predictions as the Gravity model. Other forms of the radiation model In 1971 famed economist William Alonso produced a working paper that describes a mathematical model of human mobility. In that manuscript Alonso remarks: \\"It is almost as if an urban area were a radioactive body, emitting particles at a steady rate[.]\\" In addition to many of the same mathematical terms used by Simini et al., Alonso's radiation model includes measures of climate (degree days) and wealth (per capita income) for both the emitting and receiving locales, but only includes the distance between these urban areas as opposed to a radial measure of intervening population density. Other models of human mobility The most influential model to describe trade patterns, and in a similar way, describe human mobility is the gravity model of trade. The model predicts, that the migration flow is proportional to the population of the cities/countries, and it is reciprocal in a quadratic order in the distance between them. Although, it is an intuitive description of the flows, and it is used to describe gravitational forces in physics, in terms of migration it does not perform well empirically. Moreover, the model just simply assumes the given functional form without any theoretical background.

It is endemic to Spain with habitat in the Sierra Nevada in Andalusia (Granada and Almer√≠a provinces), and is an endangered species. It is a small butterfly (forewing length is 11 to 16 mm) that has a sexual dimorphism, the upperside of the male is bright blue to light sky blue , that of the female is brown, decorated with a submarginal line of large orange macules. Both sexes have their wings lined with a white fringe.The underside is light ochre to brownish-grey adorned with a submarginal line of white lunula centred by a more or less marked black point and discreetly surrounded by orange. The forewing verso of the male has six to seven postdiscal spots.On the hindwing verso there are from eleven to thirteen spots: two to four basal, one discal and from seven to eight postdiscal. The discal spot is triangular and is almost without black scales in its centre, so that the white area of the spot is quite wide. Submarginal lunules are of pale orange colour, they are variable in number and size and close to them are noticeable black marginal spots.Tom Tolman; Richard Lewington Collins Butterfly Guide: The Most Complete Field Guide to the Butterflies of Britain and Europe Harper Collins Munguira, ML, Castro, S, Barea-Azc√≥n, JM, Olivares, J, Miteva, S. 2015.

It is the second-brightest Wolf‚ÄìRayet star in the sky, although much of the visual brightness comes from the massive companions and it is not one of the closest of its type. Description Theta Muscae is a remote triple star system, the primary component of which is a carbon-sequence Wolf‚ÄìRayet star. This is a variety of highly-luminous hot blue star that has blown off its hydrogen envelope and is emitting heavier elements, in this case carbon, amid a strong stellar wind. Theta Muscae is the second-brightest such star in the sky after Gamma Velorum in Vela. Œ∏ Mus is beyond the current reach of useful visual parallax measurements, but has been estimated as around 7,400 light-years (460 million astronomical units) from Earth. While cataloging the stars in the far- southern sky, French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille gave the star its Bayer designation in 1756. Optical binary To small telescopes, Theta Muscae appears as a double star, with a blue-cream brighter star and an O9III companion of magnitude 7.3 some 5.3 arcseconds away. The primary Œ∏ Muscae A is a massive triple star system. The companion Œ∏ Muscae B is not part of the triple system but an optical double which happens to be along the same line of sight. It is a luminous O class giant star. It is suspected of itself being a spectroscopic binary with the companion being much fainter. Triple system The triple star Œ∏ Muscae A is composed of two parts: a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf‚ÄìRayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46 milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5 AU apart and the supergiant about 100 AU apart from them. Although the Wolf‚ÄìRayet star dominates the spectrum, it is visually only about a quarter of the brightness of the supergiant companion. All three are highly luminous: combined, they are likely to be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. The stellar winds of the Wolf‚ÄìRayet star and its close companion are so powerful that they form a shock front where they meet. The front produces X-rays. Nebula A surrounding emission nebula is now thought to be a supernova remnant, not directly connected to Œ∏ Mus.

He also performed other research projects in regard to food selection by mammals and other areas of animal reproduction and nutrient intake. Dove was a member of the faculty of the University of Maine. Early life and education Dove was born in Marion, Iowa, on 11 April 1897. He earned his B.S. from Iowa State College, in 1922. He earned an M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1923, and his Ph.D. in 1927. Career =Dove's Unicorn Research= The horn of the unicorn dates back all the way to ancient times where they were sought after by kings and queens because they were believed to have magical powers as an antidote against poisons. The typical description in the mythology of a unicorn would have the head and neck and the fine-boned, graceful legs of the horse; the beard and divided hooves of the Capridae; (part of the Artiodactyla family) the tail of the oryx; and a single spike spiraling from the forehead. The artificial production of unicorns has been suggested a number of times in the past. Fran√ßois Levaillant, 1776, in his \\"Travels to Africa,\\" describes a process of contriving the horns of an ox. During more contemporary times has there been articles of accounts of so- called \\"unicorned\\" sheep in Nepal, and what fascinated him was the manner in which they were created. The process adopted was branding with a red-hot iron the male lambs when they are about two or three months old on their horns when they begin to sprout. The wounds are then treated with a mixture of oil and soot and when they heal, instead of growing at their usual places and spreading, they come out as on through the middle of their skull. Although more recently has scientific scrutiny began to arise over these accounts, trying to disprove them. A majority of naturalists are inclined to say that the mere fact of searing the budding horns would not result in those appendages sprouting out at the summit of the skull instead of still sprouting out of sides as in natural horns do. However it is true that horns of a young animal might be induced to grow together by binding them together, but that would still put an unnatural strain on them and make them grow out bony and unnatural, they would not arise smooth and straight out the middle of the skull as stated in previous research. On March, 1933, an operation was performed on a day-old male Ayrshire calf. The two horns were cut placed closely together over the frontal stitches at the intersection of the lines drawn from the original horn spouts. The horn buds were trimmed flat. The frontal periosteum it was expected that the two horns would fuse together into one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located above and between the eyes. The experiment was successful, at the age of two years the two buds have formed together into one large horn molded into the forehead for support. What makes this unicorn different from the other ones is all in the horn, unlike the other unicorns the horn spike grew from the skull instead of upon. A single united sheath covers the horn spike, the horn curves slightly upward toward the tip and gracefully extends the curve of the back and neck when the animal stands at attention. Like that of a mythical unicorn described by Ctesias and Fresnel, the horn sheath is white or grayish-white at the base and is tipped with black. (Had the unicorn been a female, the horn would be tipped with red, since the color appears as a sex-limited factor in this particular breed. This Ayrshire bull, whose Scottish ancestors flourished under King James VI, who, as James I of England put the unicorn on England's coat of arms, is a true unicorn. Although it is an animal with the hereditary potentiality for two horns, he recognizes the power of a single horn which he uses as a prow to pass under fences and barriers in his path. =The Unibull Experiment= The Unibull was one of W. Franklin Dove's more well known experiments. In this experiment he theorized that the horns didn't grow from the skull but grew into the skull over time from horn buds. In order to test his hypothesis he conducted his experiments on many animals like sheep, cows, and goats, as well as the famous Unibull. W. Franklin Dove acknowledged that horns don't actually grow from the skull, but instead, they are actually unattached bits of tissue that eventually root their way into the skull. He also did more in-depth research about horns and learned that people before him have been creating \\"unicorn\\" animals. For example, some sheep were made into single horned sheep by branding two- or three-month-old lambs on their horn buds and then treating them with a mixture of oil and soot while they were healing so that the horns grew from the middle of the skull. So, Dove reasoned that the positioning of the horns is quite open to natural or artificial variation which would mean that \\"unicorns\\" were not a total contradiction of the laws of nature. To test his theory, he took a day old calf and surgically removed its horn buds and cut them so that they would fit together, and then implanted them in the center of the calf's head. The circular horn buds were trimmed flat at their point of contact so as to provide a larger fusion surface. It was expected that the two horn buds would fuse together to form one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located somewhat between the eyes to mimic the horn of the unicorn. The experiment was proven to be successful as the bull grew the horn buds fused together and started to form a single, straight horn about a foot in length. The horn functioned very well for the bull, perhaps even better than the normal horns the bulls have. The bull eventually became the leader of its herd and was rarely challenged. An interesting side effect of this horn was the bulls abnormally docile personality. He also created \\"unicorns\\" out of goats as well as cows. Besides making \\"unicorns\\" he also made tri-horned animals. =Other research= One of Dove's published research articles, \\"Developing Food Acceptance Research\\", discusses many aspects of the necessity of developing new methods of food research and the relation to food acceptance among individuals. The article was written shortly after World War II and the purpose was to examine the causes of food nonacceptance. In order to discuss the topic, Dove refers to the unconscious acceptance 'panels' that families held during their meal times. Some of the factors behavioral factors that influence the acceptance of food include: imitation (when a child imitates those choices of their parents), domination (punishment through taking or privileging food), urging (encouragement to eat food for health advantages), and resistance (refusing to partake in foods that are presented). Other areas of consideration for food acceptance included all physical attributes like odor, texture, and flavor; the volume of food presented; the quality of the soil the food was grown on; the manner in which food is stored, as well as the quality of that storage. From all of these, the agriculture of the time was formed. Dove states that the awareness of food acceptance is brought forth with the change to commercial farming where the best product comes from quantity. Home-grown foods were replaced with standardized products. The requirement for processed foods increased when the armies of WWII began to grow. Dove says that the missing link that has not been studied is food acceptability between the consumer and the food. He also states that many specialized areas need to be studied in regard to food acceptability, including: grading of food quality, quality control, chemists to study treated foods and biologists to study relativity between food gathering and hunger. The ultimate conclusion of Dove's research was that attitudes related to food acceptance were due to habits of choosing food made from birth to adulthood, and other factors including climate and socioeconomics and religious characteristics of each region. Another research project Dove conducting involved the relationship between sterility and the copulatory organ in poultry in his article, \\"Sex Sterility and the Diminutive Copulatory Organ in Domestic Fowl.\\" Cloacas were examined in White Leghorns for a diminutive copulatory organ. Out of 78 individuals, 4 were discovered to be lacking this organ and 3 of the 4 were found to be sterile or have abnormal reproductive results. One of these four had perished and during the necropsy was found to have abnormally small testicles (one-fourth the normal size). The second cockerel was allowed the opportunity to reproduce with twelve female individuals for thirteen days and was unsuccessful in fertilizing any eggs. Of the remaining two, one fertilized a minute portion of an egg sample and the other fertilized practically all eggs of a sample of 24. It was determined that a type of sterility can be assumed by examination of the cloaca before placing a male into a mating pen. However, the inability to locate the gland does not always mean it is nonexistent ‚Äì it could just be smaller in size. In this experiment, there was no relation in regard to the size of the gland and the fertility of the cockerel. There were some exceptions in the experiment that Dove writes could have been due to late development of the gonads in comparison to the opposite sex‚Äôs. Personal life Dove married Ruth Rebecca Stone (1908‚Äì1983) on 5 September 1933, in Montgomery, Alabama. He died on 24 March 1972 in Oak Park, Illinois.
