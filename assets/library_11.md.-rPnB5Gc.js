It runs north-south, from the junction with the western end of Fulham Road in the north, where it continues to Hammersmith as Fulham Palace Road, past the junction with the western end of New King's Road, and ends in the south where it would have continued to cross the River Thames via Putney Bridge from 1729 to 1886. In 1886, a new stone bridge was built somewhat to the west of the existing bridge, and the old wooden bridge was demolished. The section between Fulham Road and New King's Road is part of the A219. The London historian, Barbara Denny, writes about Nos.49-55 having been the site of a tapestry manufactory in the mid 18th-century, run by the priest adventurer, Pierre Parisot. The reasons for bringing his factory to Fulham were twofold: the French Gobelins Manufactory was already established in Fulham and he wished to introduce a 'youth training scheme' for young draughtsmen, dyers and weavers. The site subsequently became a school. In his 1860 work, A walk from London to Fulham, Thomas Crofton Croker notes that Fulham High Street ran from London Road in the north to Church Row in the south, and was originally called Bear Street and sometimes Fulham Street. Croker notes that even in his day, several fine mansions had been demolished. There are several pubs, including the Golden Lion, the King's Head, the Eight Bells, and the Temperance, the latter having originally been a Temperance Billiard Hall. Other notable buildings include the Grade II listed Fulham House, dates to the reign of Edward III, and past inhabitants include Ralph Warren, the Lord Mayor of London in 1536, and the cloth merchant Sir Thomas White.

Founded in January 2012, the band is led by saxophonist Pete Wareham, former leader of now defunct jazz/punk band Acoustic Ladyland and saxophonist in British jazz band Polar Bear. The original line-up included saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings (Sons Of Kemet, The Comet Is Coming, The Heliocentrics), drummer Tom Skinner (Sons of Kemet, Mulatu Astatke, Hello Skinny), vocalist Kushal Gaya (Zun Zun Egui), bassist Ruth Goller (Acoustic Ladyland) and percussionist Satin Singh (Fela!, Transglobal Underground). Hutchings and Skinner have been replaced by George Crowley and Dave Smith respectively. They were signed to The Leaf Label and released their debut album on 17 June 2013, followed by Live At The New Empowering Church on 19 April 2014. Their second studio album, Last Evenings On Earth, was released on 29 April 2016. They signed to Decca Records in 2019 and will release their third studio album 100% Yes on 27 March 2020. Career =Early history= After the break up of Acoustic Ladyland, bandleader Pete Wareham began exploring Egyptian, Nubian and other North African music. In an interview with M Magazine, Wareham explains that he included some of this music in a DJ set he was performing, and seeing the positive reaction from the crowd, decided to write and perform music in this style. He assembled the band from musicians he had worked with in various projects and collaborations, initially intending it to be an instrumental line-up. Vocalist Kushal Gaya was added to the group shortly after the initial rehearsals. The name of the band comes from an album by James Chance, released in Japan in 1986 on Selfish Records. Wareham has stated that he contacted Chance with a request to use the name and received \\"his blessing\\" for the project. Melt Yourself Down subsequently performed with James Chance at shows in New York and London in 2014. Wareham and Chance had previously collaborated when Chance performed on a track from Acoustic Ladyland's third album, Skinny Grin. =Melt Yourself Down (2013)= In June 2013, the band released their self-titled album Melt Yourself Down, featuring the singles \\"We Are Enough\\", \\"Release!\\" and \\"Fix My Life\\". The album was produced and mixed by London-based songwriter, electronic musician, and artist Leafcutter John, who performs alongside Wareham in Polar Bear. The album's \\"intense brew of jazz, punk, and African elements\\" has been described as \\"the sound of Cairo '57, Cologne '72, New York '78 and London 2013\\" in a review by The Daily Telegraph amongst an array of other positive reviews. A second edition of this album was released in January 2016, as part of a series of re-releases made by The Leaf Label as part of their 20th anniversary celebrations through the Pledge Music service. =Live At The New Empowering Church (2014)= As part of Record Store Day 2014, Melt Yourself Down released the album Live At The New Empowering Church, with only 900 copies of the vinyl LP available worldwide.

The track \\"The God Of You\\" was released on 26 February as a second single, premiered on The Quietus. In an announcement by Clash, the album was described as a \\"blast of musical exploration\\" with \\"an apocalyptic tone\\". Drowned In Sound wrote that \\"the compositions are more complex, the music tighter and everything has an immediacy that was missing before...Last Evenings on Earth is as vast and sprawling as their self-titled debut, yet at the same time it‚Äôs concise and refined\\". In August 2016, Last Evenings On Earth was nominated for Best ‚ÄòDifficult‚Äô Second Album in the AIM awards. =Another Weapon (2016)= On 12 July 2016, Melt Yourself Down announced the release of new single \\"Another Weapon\\".

If a state has laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing, those regulations would be the rules that applied in that state, not any regulations created by the federal government. The bill passed the House during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Department of the Interior is reportedly in the process of creating regulations governing fracking on Indian and federal land. The rules would require companies to disclose what chemicals they used and would \\"create standards around well integrity and management of so-called flowback water.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act would amend the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to prohibit the United States Department of the Interior from enforcing any federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing (including any component of that process), relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in any state that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for that activity. The bill would require the Department to recognize and defer to state regulations, permitting, and guidance, for all activities related to hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land regardless of whether those rules are duplicative, more or less restrictive, have different requirements, or do not meet federal guidelines. The bill defines \\"hydraulic fracturing\\" as the process by which fracturing fluids (including a fracturing fluid system) are pumped into an underground geologic formation to generate fractures or cracks, thereby increasing rock permeability near the wellbore and improving production of natural gas or oil. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 31, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2728 would prevent the Department of the Interior (DOI) from enforcing regulations related to hydraulic fracturing in any state where those activities are governed by state regulations. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping liquids into the ground to generate cracks within geologic formations to increase access to liquids and gases trapped within those formations. Because there are currently no federal regulations directly related to hydraulic fracturing, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing H.R. 2728 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. The Department of the Interior has proposed regulations concerning hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. If those, or similar regulations, were to go into force in the future, H.R. 2728 could limit the implementation of those regulations, possibly reducing federal costs. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2728 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on July 18, 2013 by Rep. Bill Flores (R, TX-17). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. The Natural Resources Committee voted 23-15 for the bill to be reported (amended) on July 31, 2013. On November 12, 2013, it was released alongside House Report 113-261. On November 15, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered on November 20, 2013. On November 20, 2013, the House voted in Roll Call Vote 604 to pass the bill 235-187. Debate and discussion Republicans argued that proposed federal regulations related to fracking would add too much red tape. Republican Representative Rob Bishop (Utah) supported the bill because it would help states, especially in the western part of the country, to develop their own energy resources. Western states have a much higher percentage of federal land. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) opposed the bill because it would exempt the states that had weak or minimal state regulations about fracking from more restrictive federal regulations.

Biography  = Early life = Fran√ßoise Sullivan grew up in Montreal, Quebec, the youngest child and only girl in a middle-class family with four boys. Her father was a lawyer who worked as the Deputy Minister of the Federal Post Office Department. Her father enjoyed poetry and both he and her mother encouraged her early interest in the arts by enrolling her in dance, theatre, and painting lessons. = Education = Sullivan studied classical dance with G√©rald Crevier from 1934 to 1945. She also took courses in visual arts, studying at Hochelaga Convent in 1939 and, at sixteen, began attending the √âcole des beaux-arts de Montr√©al from 1940 to 1944. Her early paintings were influenced by Fauvism and Cubism. In 1941 she came into contact with the Qu√©becois painter Paul-√âmile Borduas and members of the group Les Automatistes. Her friendship with Bourduas and the group influenced her paintings and performances in the following years. In 1948, Sullivan signed Les Automatistes' Refus Global manifesto, which included her essay La danse et l'espoir (Dance and Hope). From 1945 to 1947, Sullivan lived in New York where she studied modern dance with Franziska Boas, the daughter of anthropologist Franz Boas. She also studied briefly with Martha Graham and Louis Horst. In 1949, Sullivan married the painter Paterson Ewen. Between 1952 and 1956, she worked as a dancer and choreographer for CBC television. In 1959, she studied metal welding under Armand Vaillancourt. She then returned to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Montr√©al in 1960 to study under Louis Archambault. In 1961, she studied at the √âcole des arts et m√©tiers in Lachine.  Career  Sullivan returned to Montr√©al in 1947 and continued choreographing modern dance. In 1948, accompanied by Jean-Paul Riopelle and Maurice Perron, Sullivan performed Danse dans la neige (Dance in the Snow) outside in Otterburn Park, Quebec. Perron and Riopelle both documented the performance, however, only Perron's photographs remain as Riopelle's film footage was later lost. Like other members of Les Automatistes Sullivan was interested in 'psychic automatism' and Danse dans la neige was the second in a series of performances in which Sullivan improvised gestural movements to explore the seasons. Danse dans la neige is considered one of the most significant pieces of performance art in Canadian art history. The only score was the crunching of her own footsteps in the thickly crusted snow; her small audience consisted of Riopelle, Perron, their cameras, and the landscape itself. In 2007 Sullivan reworked her first two performances Summer and Danse dans la neige and completed two more choreographed dances which were filmed by Mario C√¥t√© to create Les Saisons Sullivan. On the 3rd of April, 1948 Sullivan performed with her dance partner, Jeanne Renaud, at Ross House on the McGill University campus in Montr√©al. Their collaborative performance featured choreographed and improvised movements, accompanied by a poetry reading by Claude Gauvreau. This event is considered a significant moment in the history of modern dance in Qu√©bec. In the late 1950s, Sullivan turned to sculpture under the guidance of Armand Vaillancourt and learned welding at √âcole des arts et m√©tiers in Lachine, Qu√©bec. Her work was soon recognized as some of the most important modern sculpture in Qu√©bec. In 1960, she took a three-month course in sculpture with Louis Archambault at the √âcole des beaux-arts de Montr√©al where she learned how to work with wood, iron, and plaster. In 1967 Sullivan received multiple commissions for monumental public sculpture. One, Callooh Callay, was installed on the fairgrounds of Expo 67, and the other, Aeris Ludus, was exhibited as part of Sculpture '67 at Nathan Phillips Square. In the late 1960s, Sullivan and Ewen experimented with plexiglass. In 1976, the couple collaborated with the sculptor David Moore on a work for the infamous Corridart exhibit. The work, Legend of Artists, used a series of vitrines and didactic panels to illuminate the rich history of art and artists' lives in the city. When Jean Drapeau ordered Corridart dismantled, Sullivan was one of the twelve artists who sued the city, a case that took twelve years to win. During the 1980s, Sullivan returned to painting. Between 1982 and 1994, she produced several series, which are regarded as the culmination of her work in this medium. These series include the Cretan Cycle (1983-85), the Hommages (2002-03), and the Tondos (1980s). In 1997, she completed Montagnes (Mountains), a granite wall located in the main lobby of President Kennedy Pavilion of Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. Montagnes is the only permanently installed Sullivan sculpture. In 2000, UQAM awarded her an honorary doctorate.

The law authorizes the DOD to spend $607 billion in Fiscal Year 2014. The bill passed the U.S. Senate on December 19, 2013, the 53rd consecutive year that a National Defense Authorization Act had been passed. Background During the 113th United States Congress, four separate bills titled the \\"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 were introduced. Those bills were: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (S. 1197; 113th Congress), which received lengthy debate in the Senate; , which never made it out of committee; , which passed the House; and , which is the bill that became law. Summary of the bill The bill authorizes various programs in the United States Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, and the United States Air Force, including requirements for reports and placing future spending caps. The bill also formally revises the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve its ability to handle both the victims and perpetrators sexual assault, and to decriminalize consensual sodomy. Specific provisions of the bill * Pentagon-run anti-narcotics programs * helping the Jordanian military secure its border with Syria * funding for the destruction of chemical weapons in Syria * Prohibition on new combat or camouflage utility uniforms not adopted by all the services. (Section 352) Procedural history The NDAA 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on October 22, 2013 by Rep. Theodore E. Deutch (D, FL-21). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Armed Services. On October 28, 2013, the House voted to pass the bill by a voice vote. It was received in the United States Senate and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on October 29, 2013. The Senate passed the bill on November 19, 2013, with amendments. The House agreed to the Senate amendments and added their own amendments on December 12, 2013. The compromise agreement was structured in a \\"fast-track process that precludes senators from tacking on controversial amendments dealing with Iran sanctions and other divisive issues.\\" The Senate agreed to those amendments on December 19, 2013 in Roll Call Vote 284 by a vote of 84‚Äì15. On December 26, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Debate and discussion =Supporters= Senator Carl Levin said that \\"the bill before us is not a Democratic bill and it is not a Republican bill. It is a bipartisan, bicameral defense bill.\\" He argued that the bill \\"ensures that important pay and benefits, including combat pay, will continue; includes powerful and important new tools in our fight against military sexual assault; and makes progress toward the day we can close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay.\\" =Criticism= The bill was criticized for spending too much money. Director of the Arms & Security Project William Hartung of the Center for International Policy said that \\"the passage of a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that calls for $30 billion more for the Pentagon and allied agencies than is contained in the recent budget deal passed by both houses of Congress is just the latest indication that defense hawks continue to live in their own world, untroubled by fiscal constraints.\\" President Ryan Alexander of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense opposed over spending in the bill, including a provision of the bill that authorized the DOD to spend money on a weapons system that they did not request money to buy. That provision was $178 million for M-1 Abrams tanks. Moreover, the NDAA provision (first signed into law in 2012) which permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial, remains in 2014. A lawsuit filed by plaintiffs including journalist Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky and Daniel Ellsberg against the provision has been aggressively fought at every turn by the government's attorneys. The plaintiffs argue that the NDAA provision constitutes a significant expansion of the laws regarding indefinite detention already established by Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF).Obama signs NDAA 2014, indefinite detention remains.

For instance, in this view Xi Jinping Thought is considered to represent Marxist‚ÄìLeninist policies suited for China's present condition while Deng Xiaoping Theory was considered relevant for the period when it was formulated. The term entered common usage during the era of Deng Xiaoping and was largely associated with Deng's overall program of adopting elements of market economics as a means to foster growth using foreign investment and to increase productivity (especially in the countryside where 80% of China's population lived) while the Chinese Communist Party retained both its formal commitment to achieve communism and its monopoly on political power. In the party's official narrative, socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism‚ÄìLeninism adapted to Chinese conditions and a product of scientific socialism. The theory stipulated that China was in the primary stage of socialism due to its relatively low level of material wealth and needed to engage in economic growth before it pursued a more egalitarian form of socialism, which in turn would lead to a communist society described in Marxist orthodoxy.http://www.fengqi.sh.cn/en/news/knowledge9.html  Primary stage of socialism  = During Mao Zedong era = The concept of a primary stage of socialism was conceived before China introduced economic reforms. In the early 1950s, economists Yu Guangyuan, Xue Muqiao and Sun Yefang raised the question of socialist transformation in which China's economy of low productive force was in a transitional period, a position which Mao Zedong endorsed briefly until 1957. When discussing the necessity of commodity relations at the 1st Zhengzhou Conference (2‚Äì10 November 1958), for example, Mao‚Äîthe Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committeesaid that China was in the \\"initial stage of socialism\\". However, Mao never elaborated on the idea and his successors were left to do this. = After Mao Zedong's death = On 5 May 1978, the article \\"Putting into Effect the Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Work\\" () elaborated on the idea that China was still at the first stage of reaching pure communism and that it had not become a truly socialist society. The article was written by members in the State Council's Political Research Office led by economist Yu Guangyuan on the orders of Deng Xiaoping so as to \\"criticize and repudiate\\" the beliefs of the communist left. After reading it, Deng himself authored a brief memo saying that it was \\"well-written, and shows that the nature of distribution by labor is not capitalist, but socialist [...] [and] to implement this principle, many things are to be done, and many institutions to be revived. In all, this is to give incentives for us to do better\\". The term reappeared at the 6th plenum of the 11th Central Committee on 27 June 1981 in the document \\"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of our Party since the Founding of the PRC\\". Hu Yaobang, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, used the term in his report to the 12th National Congress on 1 September 1982. It was not until the \\"Resolution Concerning the Guiding Principle in Building Socialist Spiritual Civilization\\" at the 6th plenum of the 12th Central Committee that the term was used in the defense of the economic reforms which were being introduced. At the 13th National Congress, acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on behalf of the 12th Central Committee delivered the report \\"Advance Along the Road of Socialism with Chinese characteristics\\". He wrote that China was a socialist society, but that socialism in China was in its primary stage, a Chinese peculiarity which was due to the undeveloped state of the country's productive forces. During this phase of development, Zhao recommended introducing a planned commodity economy on the basis of public ownership. The main failure of the communist right according to Zhao was that they failed to acknowledge that China could reach socialism by bypassing capitalism. The main failure of the communist left was that they held the \\"utopian position\\" that China could bypass the primary stage of socialism in which the productive forces are to be modernized. On 5 October 1987, Yu Guangyuan, a major author of the concept, published an article entitled \\"Economy in the Initial Stage of Socialism\\" and speculated that this historical stage will last for two decades and perhaps much longer. This represents, says Ian Wilson, \\"a severe blight on the expectations raised during the early 70s, when the old eight-grade wage scale was being compressed to only three levels and a more even distributive system was assumed to be an important national goal\\". On 25 October, Zhao further expounded on the concept of the primary stage of socialism and said that the party line was to follow \\"One Center, Two Basic Points\\"‚Äîthe central focus of the Chinese state was economic development, but that this should occur simultaneously through centralized political control (i.e. the Four Cardinal Principles) and upholding the policy of reform and opening up. General Secretary Jiang Zemin further elaborated on the concept ten years later, first during a speech to the Central Party School on 29 May 1997 and again in his report to the 15th National Congress on 12 September. According to Jiang, the 3rd plenum of the 11th Central Committee correctly analyzed and formulated a scientifically correct program for the problems facing China and socialism. In Jiang's words, the primary stage of socialism was an \\"undeveloped stage\\". The fundamental task of socialism is to develop the productive forces, therefore the main aim during the primary stage should be the further development of the national productive forces. The primary contradiction in Chinese society during the primary stage of socialism is \\"the growing material and cultural needs of the people and the backwardness of production\\". This contradiction will remain until China has completed the process of primary stage of socialism‚Äîand because of it‚Äîeconomic development should remain the party's main focus during this stage. Jiang elaborated on three points to develop the primary stage of socialism. The first‚Äîto develop a socialist economy with Chinese characteristics‚Äîmeant developing the economy by emancipating and modernizing the forces of production while developing a market economy. The second‚Äîbuilding socialist politics with Chinese characteristics‚Äîmeant \\"managing state affairs according to the law\\", developing socialist democracy under the party and making the \\"people the masters of the country\\". The third point‚Äîbuilding socialist culture with Chinese characteristics‚Äîmeant turning Marxism into the guide to train the people so as to give them \\"high ideals, moral integrity, a good education, and a strong sense of discipline, and developing a national scientific, and popular socialist culture geared to the needs of modernization, of the world, and of the future\\". When asked how long the primary stage of socialism would last, Zhao replied \\"[i]t will be at least 100 years [...] [before] socialist modernization will have been in the main accomplished\\". The state constitution states that \\"China will be in the primary stage of socialism for a long time to come\\". As with Zhao, Jiang believed that it would take at least 100 years to reach a more advanced stage.  Socialist market economy  Deng Xiaoping, the architect of the Chinese economic reforms, did not believe that the market economy was synonymous with capitalism or that planning was synonymous with socialism. During his southern tour, he said that \\"planning and market forces are not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity\\". = Ideological justification = In the 1980s, it became evident to Chinese economists that the Marxist theory of the law of value‚Äîunderstood as the expression of the labor theory of value‚Äîcould not serve as the basis of China's pricing system. They concluded that Marx never intended his theory of law of value to work \\"as an expression of 'concretized labor time'\\". Marx's notion of \\"prices of production\\" was meaningless to the Soviet-styled planned economies since price formations were according to Marx established by markets. Soviet planners had used the law of value as a basis to rationalize prices in the planned economy. According to Soviet sources, prices were \\"planned with an eye to the [...] basic requirements of the law of value\\". However, the primary fault with the Soviet interpretation was that they tried to calibrate prices without a competitive market since according to Marx competitive markets allowed for an equilibrium of profit rates which led to an increase in the prices of production. The rejection of the Soviet interpretation of the law of value led to the acceptance of the idea that China was still in the primary stage of socialism. The basic argument was that conditions envisaged by Marx for reaching the socialist stage of development did not yet exist in China. Mao said that the imposition of \\"progressive relations of production\\" would revolutionize production. His successor's rejection of this view according to A. James Gregor has thwarted the ideological continuity of Maoism‚Äîofficially Mao Zedong Thought. Classical Marxism had argued that a socialist revolution would only take place in advanced capitalist societies and its success would signal the transition from a capitalist commodity-based economy to a \\"product economy\\" in which goods would be distributed for people's need and not for profit. If because of a lack of a coherent explanation in the chance of failure this revolution did not occur, the revolutionaries would be forced to take over the responsibilities of the bourgeoisie. Chinese communists are thus looking for a new Marxist theory of development. Party theorist Luo Rongqu recognized that the founders of Marxism had never \\"formulated any systematic theory on the development of the non-Western world\\" and said that the Chinese Communist Party should \\"establish their own synthesized theoretical framework to study the problem of modern development\\". According to A. James Gregor, the implication of this stance is that \\"Chinese Marxism is currently in a state of profound theoretical discontinuity\\". = Private ownership = The Chinese government's understanding of private ownership is rooted in classical Marxism. Since China adopted socialism when it was a semi-feudal and semi- colonial country, it is in the primary stage of socialism, because of this, certain policies and system characteristicssuch as commodity production for the market, the existence of a private sector and the reliance of the profit motive in enterprise management‚Äîwere changed. These changes were allowed as long as they improve productivity and modernize the means of production and thus further develop socialism. The Chinese Communist Party still considers private ownership to be non-socialist. However, according to party theorists the existence and growth of private ownership does not necessarily undermine socialism and promote capitalism in China. It is argued that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels never proposed the immediate abolishment of private ownership. According to Engel's book Principles of Communism, the proletariat can only abolish private ownership when the necessary conditions have been met. In the phase before the abolishment of private ownership, Engels proposed progressive taxation, high inheritance taxes and compulsory bond purchases to restrict private property while using the competitive powers of state-owned enterprises to expand the public sector. Marx and Engels proposed similar measures in The Communist Manifesto in regards to advanced countries, but since China was economically undeveloped party theorists called for flexibility regarding the party's handling of private property. According to party theorist Liu Shuiyuan, the New Economic Policy program initiated by Soviet authorities in the aftermath of the war communism program is a good example of flexibility by socialist authorities. Party theorist Li Xuai said that private ownership inevitably involves capitalist exploitation. However, Li regards private property and exploitation as necessary in the primary stage of socialism, claiming that capitalism in its primary stage uses remnants of the old society to build itself. Sun Liancheng and Lin Huiyong said that Marx and Engels‚Äîin their interpretation of The Communist Manifesto‚Äîcriticized private ownership when it was owned solely by the bourgeoisie, but not individual ownership in which everyone owns the means of production and hence cannot be exploited by others. Individual ownership is considered consistent with socialism since Marx wrote that post-capitalist society would entail the rebuilding of \\"associated social individual ownership\\".

A general strike (or mass strike) is a strike action in which a substantial proportion of the total labour force in a city, region, or country participates. General strikes are characterised by the participation of workers in a multitude of workplaces, and tend to involve entire communities. General strikes first occurred in the mid-19th century, and have characterised many historically important strikes.  History  = Antiquity = An early predecessor of the general strike may have been the secessio plebis in ancient Rome. In the Outline Of History, H.G. Wells recorded \\"the general strike of the plebeians; the plebeians seem to have invented the strike, which now makes its first appearance in history.\\"H.G. Wells, Outline Of History, Waverly Book Company, 1920, page 225 Their first strike occurred because they \\"saw with indignation their friends, who had often served the state bravely in the legions, thrown into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand of patrician creditors.\\" Wells noted that \\"[t]he patricians made a mean use of their political advantages to grow rich through the national conquests at the expense not only of the defeated enemy, but of the poorer plebeian...\\" The plebeians, who were expected to obey the laws, but were not allowed to know the laws (which patricians were able to recite from memory),H.G. Wells, Outline Of History, Waverly Book Company, 1920, pages 225-226 were successful, winning the right to appeal any injustice to the general assembly. In 450 BC., in a concession resulting from the rebellion of the plebeians, the laws of Rome were written for all to peruse. = Modern era = The general strike action only became a feature of the political landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial working class; they lived in cities and exchanged their labour for payment. By the 1830s, when the Chartist movement was at its peak, a true and widespread 'workers' consciousness' was beginning to awaken in England. William Benbow pictured in Punch in 1848. The first theorist to formulate and popularise the idea of a general strike for the purpose of political reform was the radical pamphleteer William Benbow.Carpenter, Niles. William Benbow and the Origin of the General Strike. The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Vol. 35, No. 3 (May, 1921), pp. 491-499. Oxford University Press Closely involved with planning the attempted Blanketeers protest march by Lancashire weavers in March 1817, he became an associate of William Cobbett and passed his time \\"agitating the labouring classes at their trades meetings and club-houses.\\" On 28 January 1832 Benbow published a pamphlet entitled Grand National Holiday and Congress of the Productive Classes. Benbow began to advocate direct and even violent action for political reform, in particular he advanced his idea for a \\"national holiday\\" and \\"national convention\\". By this he meant an extended period of general strike by the working classes, which would be a sacred or holy action (hence \\"holy-day\\"), during which time local committees would keep the peace and elect delegates to a national convention or congress, which would agree the future direction of the nation. The striking workers were to support themselves with savings and confiscated parish funds, and by demanding contributions from rich people. Benbow's idea of a Grand National Holiday was adopted by the Chartist Congress of 1839, Benbow having spent time in Manchester during 1838-9 promoting the cause and his pamphlet. In 1842 the demands for fairer wages and conditions across many different industries finally exploded into the first modern general strike (the 1842 general strike). After the second Chartist Petition was presented to Parliament in April 1842 and rejected, the strike began in the coal mines of Staffordshire, England, and soon spread through Britain affecting factories, mills in Lancashire and coal mines from Dundee to South Wales and Cornwall. Instead of being a spontaneous uprising of the mutinous masses, the strike was politically motivated and was driven by a hard-headed agenda to win concessions. Probably as much as half of the then industrial workforce were on strike at its peak ‚Äì over 500,000 men. The local leadership marshaled a growing working-class tradition to politically organise their followers to mount an articulate challenge to the capitalist, political establishment. The mass abandonment of plantations by black slaves and poor whites during the American Civil War has, controversially, been considered a general strike. In his classic history Black Reconstruction in America, W. E. B. Du Bois describes this mass abandonment in precisely these terms: > Transforming itself suddenly from a problem of abandoned plantations and > slaves captured while being used by the [Southern] enemy for military > purposes, the movement became a general strike against the slave system on > the part of all who could find opportunity. The trickling streams of > fugitives swelled to a flood. Once begun, the general strike of black and > white went madly and relentlessly on like some great saga.W.E.B. Du Bois, > Black Reconstruction in America, 1935 (New York: The Free Press, 1998), > 63-4. The next large scale general strike took place over half a century later in Belgium, in an effort to force the government to grant universal suffrage to the people. However, there were periodical strikes throughout the 19th century that could loosely be considered as 'general strikes'. In the United States, the Philadelphia General Strike of 1835 lasted for three weeks, after which the striking workers won their goal of a ten-hour workday and an increase in wages.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 1, From Colonial Times to the Founding of The American Federation of Labor, International Publishers, 1975, pages 116‚Äì118 Later general strikes include the 1877 Saint Louis general strike, which grew out of the events of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 across the United States and the 1892 New Orleans general strike. The year of 1919 saw a cascade of general strikes around the world as a result of the political convulsions caused by the First World War ‚Äì in Germany, Belfast, Seattle and Winnipeg. The Russian Revolution of 1905 saw a massive wave of social unrest across the Russian Empire, characterised by large scale general strikes on the part of the industrial workers. The 1926 United Kingdom general strike started in the coal industry and rapidly escalated; the unions called out 1,750,000 workers, mainly in the transport and steel sectors, although the strike was successfully suppressed by the government.G A. Phillips, The General Strike: The Politics of Industrial Conflict (1976)Keith Laybourn, The General Strike of 1926 (1993) = Rosa Luxemburg = At the turn of the 20th century, Belgium was particularly prone to large scale strike actions, with at least four mass strikes occurring in 1886, 1887, 1891, and 1893. In 1886, there was the Walloon Jacquerie of 1886, but without an actual leading political organisation. The final strike was the Belgian general strike of 1893 mentioned above.Many Riots in Belgium, New York Times, 13 April 1893 In 1902 the Belgian Labour Party launched another strike, which failed. Many German social democrats thought such an experiment was absurd. Drachkovitch observed that German socialists were against the general strike because \\"under the Kaiser, supporting it was not very safe.\\"Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 82 Rosa Luxemburg, in her 1906 book The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions had a different view, criticizing the Belgian Labour Party for perceived tactical incompetence: A general strike forged in advance within the fetters of legality is like a war demonstration with cannons dumped into a river within the very sight of the enemy. Carl E. Schorske wrote about the same Belgian phenomenon studied by Luxemburg as well as the German opposition to it: > In German Social Democratic circles, the general strike suffered from the > hereditary taint of its anarchist origins (...) Rosa Luxemburg, who studied > the Belgian strike, was particularly impressed with its success in > activating the political consciousness of the backward portions of the > population. She was not yet however, prepared to give it European-wide > significance. Luxemburg felt it to be appropriate only in countries in which > industry was geographically concentrated.  Purpose  General strikes have been done in order to seek \\"democracy, political representation and the provision of basic education and healthcare\\".

Japan's labour leaders complied with his ban.The Sydney Morning Herald, February 1, 1947, page 1  Concept  Ralph Chaplin, editor of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) newspaper Solidarity and later, of the Industrial Worker, identified four levels of general strike, :* A general strike in a community. :* A general strike in an industry. :* A national general strike. :* A revolutionary or class strike‚Äîthe General Strike. In the 1905 pamphlet The Social General Strike, published in Chicago in 1905, Stephen Naft had previously acknowledged the same four levels of the general strike: National Museum in Warsaw. Naft's 1905 pamphlet (translated from the German language) traced existing sentiment for this goal of the general strike to proletarians of Spain and Italy.Stephen Naft, The Social General Strike, Debating Club No. 1, Chicago, June 1905, page 6, translated from the German language pamphlet of the same name by Arnold Roller The premise of The Social General Strike is that no matter how powerfully the working class organises itself, it still has no significant power over a congress, or the executive (which has military force at its beck and call). Therefore, a general strike called by an \\"energetic and enthusiastic\\" minority of workers, might be embraced by the mass of workers who remain unorganised. Thus it may be possible, The Social General Strike noted the complexity of modern industry, identifying the many stages in the manufacturing process and geographic dispersal of related manufacturing locations as weaknesses of the industrial process during any labour dispute. The pamphlet notes the problem of hunger during a general strike, and recommends where warehouses are available for the purpose, that proletarians, However, the pamphlet asserts that, = Socialists, anarchists differ on tactics = In 1966, in a study of revolutionary socialism, Milorad M. Drachkovitch of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace (a conservative think tank), noted two tactical options which divided late 19th century and early 20th century anarchists from socialists: electoral politics, which the socialists embraced, but anarchists generally opposed; and, the general strike as a mechanism to prevent war, which anarchists supported, but socialists refused to endorse.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 81 As a group, the Socialists of the period repeatedly rejected the general strike as a tactic;Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 83 however, a number of Socialist leaders advocated its use for one reason or another.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, pages 82‚Äì83 Socialist leaders who embraced the general strike tended to see it as an instrument for obtaining political concessions. Drachkovitch identified five types of general strikes: * the political mass strike, a general strike for political rights (such as the right to vote) * the general strike as a revolutionary act that would transform society * the general strike as a \\"revolutionary exercise\\" which would eventually lead to a transformation of society * a one-day demonstration general strike on May Day (International Workers' Day), aimed at identifying a \\"worldwide proletariat\\" * commencing in 1891, a theoretical mechanism by which to stop wars between nation statesMilorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, pages 99‚Äì100 Drachkovitch perceived the first two concepts, the socialist-friendly general strike for political rights within the system, and the general strike as a revolutionary mechanism to overthrow the existing order‚Äîwhich he associated with a \\"rising anarcho-syndicalist movement\\"‚Äîas in conflict.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 99. Drachkovitch believed that the difficulty arose from the fact that the general strike was \\"one instrument\\", but was frequently considered \\"without distinction of underlying motives.\\"Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 100 Milorad M. Drachkovitch also observed the variable success of the general strike in actual use: = Syndicalism and the general strike = Orthodox labour unions typically act as a representative from the workers to employers. They bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions. Other labour organisations typically bargain for the same wage, hour, and conditions improvements, but embrace a critique of capital as establishing and maintaining a permanent working class and an elite ruling class. These unions, therefore, advocate a permanent solution to the circumstances of strikes, injunctions, and crossing other workers' picket lines.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 88Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905‚Äì1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 18Thomas J. Hagerty and W. E. Trautmann, One Big Union, An Outline of a Possible Industrial Organization of the Working Class, with Chart, 1st edition, Charles H. Kerr & Company, 1911. Given the hierarchical relationships of the existing economic system, these other unions perceive the necessity of a radical change in the social order. In brief, these unions are radical in their orientation, and may accurately be described as revolutionary. One labour movement philosophy of \\"peaceful revolution\\" is known as syndicalism. Its tactical method is the strike‚Äîthe regular strike for protecting the material welfare of the workers, and the general strike as a means to accomplish the desired permanent solution to industrial strife.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, The revolutionary internationals, 1864‚Äì1943, Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, Stanford University Press, 1966, page 84 Syndicalism has been a common union organizing principle in a number of European countries, including France, Spain, and Italy. One variation of syndicalism is anarcho-syndicalism, which (in comparison to syndicalism) develops rank and file power with democratic traditions to maintain worker control over union leadership.  Industrial Workers of the World  In the United States, Britain, and (to a lesser extent) Australia, the trend toward revolutionary unionism culminated in the growth of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Technically, the IWW is described as a union that practices revolutionary industrial unionism. Some consider the revolutionary industrial unionism of the IWW to be a form of anarcho-syndicalism.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 45 Others point out differences; for example, Ralph Chaplin has written, The IWW began to fully embrace the general strike in 1910‚Äì1911.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905‚Äì1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 140 The ultimate goal of the general strike, according to Industrial Workers of the World theory, is to displace capitalists and give control over the means of production to workers.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 90 In a 1911 speech in New York City, IWW organiser Haywood explained his view of the economic situation, and why he believed a general strike was justified, Bill Haywood believed that industrial unionism made possible the general strike, and the general strike made possible industrial democracy. According to Wobbly theory, the conventional strike is an important (but not the only) weapon for improving wages, hours, and working conditions for working people. These strikes are also good training to help workers educate themselves about the class struggle, and about what it will take to execute an eventual general strike for the purpose of achieving industrial democracy.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905‚Äì1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 141 During the final general strike, workers would not walk out of their shops, factories, mines, and mills, but would rather occupy their workplaces and take them over. Prior to taking action to initiate industrial democracy, workers would need to educate themselves with technical and managerial knowledge in order to operate industry. According to labour historian Philip S. Foner, the Wobbly conception of industrial democracy is intentionally not presented in detail by IWW theorists; in that sense, the details are left to the \\"future development of society\\".Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905‚Äì1917, International Publishers, 1997, pages 141‚Äì142 However, certain concepts are implicit. Industrial democracy will be \\"a new society [built] within the shell of the old.\\"Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 4, The Industrial Workers of the World 1905‚Äì1917, International Publishers, 1997, page 142 Members of the industrial union educate themselves to operate industry according to democratic principles, and without the current hierarchical ownership/management structure. Issues such as production and distribution would be managed by the workers themselves. In 1927 the IWW called for a three-day nationwide walkout‚Äîin essence, a demonstration general strike‚Äîto protest the execution of anarchists Ferdinando Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.Donald J. McClurg, The Colorado Coal Strike of 1927‚ÄîTactical Leadership of the IWW, Labor History, Vol. 4, No. 1, Winter, 1963, page 71 The most notable response to the call was in the Walsenburg coal district of Colorado, where 1,132 miners stayed off the job, and only 35 went to work,Donald J. McClurg, The Colorado Coal Strike of 1927: Tactical Leadership of the IWW, Labor History, Vol. 4, No. 1, Winter, 1963, page 72 a participation rate which led directly to the Colorado coal strike of 1927. On March 18, 2011, the Industrial Workers of the World website (www.iww.org) supported an endorsement of a general strike as a followup to protests against Governor Scott Walker's proposed labour legislation in Wisconsin, following a motion passed by the South Central Federation of Labor (SCFL) of Wisconsin endorsing a statewide general strike as a response to those legislative proposals.retrieved 9 April 2011http://www.scfl.org/ retrieved 9 April 2011 The SCFL website states,  Reaction of orthodox labour  The year 1919 saw a number of general strikes throughout North America, including two that were considered significant‚Äîthe Seattle General Strike, and the Winnipeg General Strike.

The official report of these proceedings described the convention as the \\"largest and in all probability the most important Convention ever held\\" by the organisation, in part for having engineered the \\"overwhelming defeat of the so-called Radical element\\" via crushing a \\"One Big Union proposition\\", and also for defeating a proposal for a nationwide general strike, both \\"by a vote of more than 20 to 1.\\"Sheet Metal Workers' Journal, Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance, Volumes 24-25, Chicago, Illinois, 1919, pages 265-267 The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central labour union (i.e., regional labour councils) from \\"taking a strike vote without prior authorization of the national officers of the union concerned\\". The change was intended to \\"check the spread of general strike sentiment and prevent recurrences of what happened at Seattle and is now going on at Winnipeg.\\" The penalty for any unauthorised strike vote was revocation of that body's charter.

In 1924, its name was changed to the Bukharan Socialist Soviet Republic (Bukharan SSR; Russian: –ë—É—Ö–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞). After the redrawing of regional borders, its territory was assigned mostly to the Uzbek SSR and some to the Turkmen SSR.  History  In 1868, the Russian Empire forced the Emirate of Bukhara to accept protectorate status. Over the next 40 years, the Russians slowly eroded at Bukhara's territory, although never actually annexing the city of Bukhara itself. However, the emir could not shut out all outside influences, and gradually some of the disaffected youth of Bukhara gravitated to Pan-Turkism, inspired by the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, ideas taken from the Islamic Jadid reform movement, and the new Bolshevik-inspired communism. These various ideologies coalesced in the Young Bukharans (, mladobukhartsy), led by Faizullah Khojaev. The Young Bukharans faced extreme obstacles as the emirate was dominated by conservative Sunni Islamic clergy. The ensuing conflict pitted the secular Young Bukharans and their Bolshevik supporters against the conservative pro-emir rebels, the Basmachi, in a conflict that lasted more than a decade. In March 1918, the Young Bukharan activists informed the Bolsheviks that the Bukharan people were ready for the revolution and awaiting liberation from the emir. The Red Army marched to the gates of Bukhara and demanded that the emir surrender the city to the Young Bukharans. A Russian source reports that the emir responded by killing the Bolshevik delegation and incited the population to a jihad against the Bolshevik \\"infidels\\". Thousands of Russians were killed in these religious riots in Bukhara and the surrounding areas; many Young Bukharans were arrested and executed; the main railway and communication links from Bukhara to Chardjui and Samarkand were destroyed. However, the emir had won only a temporary respite. By August 1920 the Turkestan Bolsheviks advocated the liquidation of the Bukhara Emirate as a centre for counter-revolutionary forces. On 3 August 1920 the Bolsheviks and the Young Bukharans agreed to act together on the understanding that the Young Bukharans would join the Communist Party. On 16 August 1920 the 4th Congress of Bukharan Communist Party held in Bolshevik-controlled Chardjui decided to overthrow the emir. On 25 August 1920 the Politburo of the Russian Communist Party of Bolesheviks confirmed orders for the Revolutionary Military Council of Turkestan concerning the \\"Bukhara question\\". B. A.

The Bukhara military operation, 1920 On 28 August 1920, an army of well-disciplined and well equipped Red Army troops under the command of Bolshevik general Mikhail Frunze attacked the city of Bukhara. On 31 August 1920, the Emir Alim Khan fled to Dushanbe in Eastern Bukhara (later he escaped from Dushanbe to Kabul in Afghanistan). On 2 September 1920, after four days of fighting, the emir's citadel (the Ark) was destroyed, the red flag was raised from the top of Kalyan Minaret. On 14 September 1920, the All-Bukharan Revolutionary Committee was set up, headed by A. Mukhitdinov. The government ‚Äì the Council of People's Nazirs (see nƒÅ·∫ìir) ‚Äì was presided over by Faizullah Khojaev.The Bukhara Republic (1920-1924), Southern Uzbekistan Historical Database. The Bukharan People's Soviet Republic was proclaimed on 8 October 1920 under Fayzulla Khodzhayev. In Soviet terminology, the republic was a \\"revolutionary- democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry\\", a transition stage to a Soviet Socialist Republic. A new constitution was adopted in September 1921, which, contrary to the Russian Constitution of 1918, allowed private ownership of land and productive assets and granted voting rights to non-proletarians (although relatives of the deposed emir, former emirate officials, and large landowners could not vote). The overthrow of the emir was the impetus for the Basmachi Revolt, a conservative anti-communist rebellion. In 1922, most of the territory of the republic (East Bukhara, roughly from Hisor to West Pamir) was controlled by Basmachi, and it took the Red Army until 1926 to fully suppress the revolt. During the first few years of the Russian Revolution, Lenin relied on a policy of encouraging local revolutions under the aegis of the local bourgeoisie, and in the early years of Bolshevik rule the Communists sought the assistance of the Jadid reformists in pushing through radical social and educational reforms. Just two weeks after the proclamation of the People's Republic, Communist Party membership in Bukhara soared to 14,000 as many local inhabitants were eager to prove their loyalty to the new regime. As the Soviet Union stabilized, it could afford to purge itself of so-called opportunists and potential nationalists. A series of expulsions stripped membership down to 1000 by 1922. The above was reflected in the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic's flag, as designed upon its foundation, combining the Communist Hammer and Sickle with the traditional Crescent, which had appeared in the flag of the Emirate of Bukhara as well as in those of the Ottoman Empire and various other Islamic states. Conversely, the flags of the Soviet Republics among which the Bukharan territory was divided in 1925 featured the Hammer and Sickle alone, omitting the Crescent. Postage stamp from August 1924 From 19 September 1924 to 17 February 1925, the Republic was known as the Bukharan Socialist Soviet Republic (Bukharan SSR). When new national boundaries were drawn up in 1924, the Bukharan SSR voted itself out of existence and became part of the new Uzbek SSR. Today the territory of the defunct Bukhara SSR lies mostly in Uzbekistan with parts in Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Khojaev, despite his Jadid background, became the first President of the Uzbek SSR. He was later purged and executed in the 1930s together with much of the intelligentsia of Central Asia.

Retrieved 10 February 2009. During its entire existence from 1920 to 1924, the Bukharan PSR was a large enclave within the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR) created in April 1918 on the territory of Russian Turkestan. Bukharan PSR, together with the Khorezm PSR, stretched from north-west to south-east in a belt that cut Turkestan ASSR into two separate parts: the small part in the south-west, corresponding to today's Turkmenistan (except a narrow strip along the southern bank of Amudarya, which was included in the Bukharan PSR), and the much larger part in the north-east, corresponding to sections of today's Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. The southern border of the Bukharan PSR stretched from north-west to south-east along the southern bank of Amudarya to Termez and then along the Panj into West Pamir, reaching Langar at its south-eastern extreme point. It bordered Samarkand Oblast to the north- east and the southern part of Fergana Oblast to the east in West Pamir. The northern border of the People's Republic reached close to Khiva in the west and touched on what is today Karakalpakstan and Navoiy Province in Uzbekistan. The People's Republic, like the Emirate of Bukhara that it succeeded, was divided into West Bukhara, including the cities of Bukhara and Karshi, and East Bukhara, roughly from Hisor to West Pamir. In the process of national delimitation of Central Asia in 1924, West Bukhara was included in the newly created Uzbek SSR (except for the south bank of Amudarya with the city of Chardjui, which went to Turkmen SSR), whereas East Bukhara, from Hisor to West Pamir, was ceded to Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik ASSR) and thus formed part of the Tajik SSR that was created later in 1929.

Life and career Yurenev was born at Dvinsk station on the Riga-Orlov railway. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905, and was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1916, but escaped serving. He joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks) in 1917 and held various positions within the Petrograd division of the party. After serving on the Petrograd Military-Revolutionary Committee, in February 1918 he was a member of the People's Commissariat for Military Affairs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He was concurrently a member of a committee which went on to form the Red Army. From May 1920 to May 1921 he was the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Kursk Governorate Soviet. From 16 May 1921 until 1 February 1922 he was Plenipotentiary Representative of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic. After serving in Bukhara, from 1 February 1922 to 14 February 1923 he was Soviet Russia's Plenipotentiary Representative in Latvia. After his posting to Latvia, he was then appointed as diplomatic representative of the Soviet Union to Czechoslovakia, and served in Prague from 14 February 1923 until 3 March 1924, after which he was the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Soviet Union to Italy from 7 March 1924 to 4 April 1925.

Although the formal name of this organization was Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Internationalists), the names \\"Mezhraionka\\" for the organization and \\"Mezhraiontsy\\" for its participants were commonly used to indicate the group's intermediate ideological position between the rival Menshevik and Bolshevik wings of the divided RSDLP. The Mezhraiontsy merged with the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Organizational history = Background = Russian social democrats had been split into numerous factions along political and ethnic lines since at least 1903 when the original divisions between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks arose. After the defeat of the first Russian Revolution in 1905, both the Bolshevik and the Menshevik factions split into smaller factions. In January 1912, the dominant Bolshevik faction led by Vladimir Lenin held a meeting in Prague, expelled Mensheviks from the party. In response, the Mensheviks, Leon Trotsky's followers, the Jewish Bund and other ethnic social democratic groups held a meeting in Vienna in August 1912 in which they called Lenin's action illegal and formed their own leadership of the RSDRP, the so-called August Bloc. To distinguish between competing RSDRPs, the Bolshevik one was called RSDRP(b) and the Menshevik one RSDRP(m). As a result of these developments, by late 1912 there were 2 separate social democratic organizations in St. Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire. The Bolsheviks had their \\"St. Petersburg Committee of the RSDRP (bolsheviks)\\" and the \\"August Bloc\\" supporters had their \\"Initiative Group of the RSDRP\\". Some St. Petersburg social democrats were unhappy with this split and created an alternative organization that would, they hoped, eventually unite all fragments of revolutionary social democracy in Russia. The only exception that they made was for those Mensheviks who were concentrating on legal forms of oppositionist activity at the expense of revolutionary activities. = Formation of the Mezhraionka = The Mezhraiontsy group was founded in November 1913 by three Bolsheviks (Konstantin Yurenev, A. M. Novosyolov and E. M. Adamovich) and one Menshevik, N. M. Yegorov. Yurenev was the informal leader of the organization until May 1917 except for one year between February 1915 and February 1916, which he spent in jail on charges of subversive activities. The members of the Inter-District Organisation occupied a centrist position between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. = Growth during the war = At the outbreak of World War I in July-August 1914 (and subsequent change of St. Petersburg's name to \\"Petrograd\\"), the faction lines within the RSDRP were drastically redrawn over the issue of support for the war. Those who supported the war were called \\"Defensists\\" and those who were opposed to it were called \\"Defeatists\\". Most members of the Mezhraionka, as well as Lenin and some Mensheviks, adopted an anti-war position and by late 1915 the organization had 60-80 members. Due to growing popular disillusionment with the war, by the time the February Revolution of 1917 broke out, the organization had 400-500 members. = 1917 Revolution = Mezhraionka members were active in Petrograd during the revolution, seizing a printing plant and publishing the first leaflet calling for an armed uprising on February 27 O.S.. After the formation of the Petrograd Soviet later that night, the Mezhraionka was given one seat in its Presidium versus two seats allocated to each nationwide socialist party like the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party. Although the Mezhraionka's original goal was to unite all Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in one party, the divisions over Russia's participation in the war proved too deep. On April 12, 1917, the Mezhraionka refused to participate in a Menshevik-sponsored unification conference because it would be dominated by the Defensist wing of the Mensheviks. From that point on, their positions began to converge with the Bolshevik positions, which were becoming more radical after Lenin's return from abroad. = Merge with the Bolsheviks = With the return of many anti-war social democratic emigres from European exile in April-June 1917, the Mezhraionka was a natural place for them to join. A number of prominent social democrats like Leon Trotsky, Adolf Joffe, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky, David Riazanov, V. Volodarsky, Lev Karakhan, Dmitry Manuilsky, and Sergey Ezhov (Tsederbaum) joined it at that time. At the elections to the Petrograd district councils in May-June 1917, the IDO and Bolsheviks formed a bloc. The Mezhraionka (membership about 4,000) merged with the Bolsheviks at the 6th Congress of the RSDLP in late July-early August 1917 in which both the groups formed a party that was formally independent of the Mensheviks. Many of its former members played an important role during the October Revolution later in the year and the subsequent Russian Civil War. The IDO published a journal of its own, Vperyod. One number was put out illegally in 1915, and publication was resumed in 1917, when it came out legally from June to August as the organ of the St. Petersburg Inter-District Committee of the United Social-Democrats (Internationalists). Eight issues were put out. After the Sixth Congress of the Party the editorial board was changed, and No. 9 of the journal appeared as the organ of the Central Committee of the RSDLP(b). Publication was discontinued in September 1917 by decision of the Central Committee.

() is a book published in 1937 by the exiled Soviet Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky. This work analyzed and criticized the course of historical development in the Soviet Union following the death of Lenin in 1924 and is regarded as Trotsky's primary work dealing with the nature of Stalinism. The book was written by Trotsky during his exile in Norway and was originally translated into Spanish by Victor Serge. The most widely available English translation is by Max Eastman. Historical background Lev Davidovich Bronstein (1879‚Äì1940), best known by his pseudonym Leon Trotsky, was one of the top leaders of the 1917 October Revolution which brought a faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the Bolsheviks) (RSDLP) to power in Russia. Trotsky had long been one of the leading Marxist revolutionaries in Imperial Russia, sentenced in 1900 to exile in a distant part of Siberia for his activities against the regime.For official accounts of Trotsky's early activity, Siberian exile, and escape, see Max Eastman, Leon Trotsky: The Portrait of a Youth. (New York: Greenberg, 1925) and Leon Trotsky, My Flight From Siberia. Malcolm Campbell, translator. (London: Carl Slieger, 1977). After a period of European exile, Trotsky returned to Russia during the abortive 1905 Russian Revolution, where his electric oratory made him a leading figure in the St. Petersburg Soviet until his arrest in December of that year.For Trotsky's activity in the St. Petersburg Soviet, see Gerald D. Suhr, 1905 in St. Petersburg: Labor, Society, and Revolution. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1989; pp. 338-345, 362-366, and 398-402 passim. Another escape to Western Europe followed. Over the next decade Trotsky moved from support of the Menshevik wing of the RSDLP to advocacy of unity of the warring factions in 1913 with the establishment of a formal organization called the Interdistrict Organization of United Social Democrats, commonly known as the \\"Mezhraiontsy.\\"Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev, \\"Trotsky,\\" in Edward Acton, Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev, and William G. Rosenberg (eds.), Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914-1921. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1997; pg. 190. The virtual collapse of the old regime during the latter part of World War I helped to motivate the Mezhraiontsy to make amends with their Bolshevik rivals, headed by Lenin, and early in 1917 Trotsky returned from exile in New York City by way of Canada to join forces as a member of the Bolshevik party's governing Central Committee. Trotsky was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the 7 November 1917 (25 October 1917 O.S.) seizure of power from the Russian Provisional Government headed by Alexander Kerensky, taking over as head of the Petrograd Soviet early in October and building that institution's Military-Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary fighting force.Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev, \\"Trotsky,\\" pg. 191. Following the successful overthrow of the Kerensky government, Trotsky was named the first People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the RSFSR of Soviet Russia. In April 1918, Trotsky was named People's Commissar for War and the Navy, in which capacity he helped to construct the Red Army that would defend the new regime against forces seeking a restoration of monarchism in the Russian Civil War. Lenin's retirement from active political life in the aftermath of a series of strokes in 1923 followed by his death in January 1924 ushered in an interregnum during which several leading candidates jockeyed for supremacy.The best survey of Soviet high politics in this period remains E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: Volume 4: The Interregnum, 1923-1924. (London: Macmillan, 1954) and A History of Soviet Russia: Volume 5: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 1. (London: Macmillan, 1958). Lenin's longtime associate and Communist International chief Grigory Zinoviev, Moscow party leader Lev Kamenev, nationalities expert and party organization secretary Joseph Stalin, and military leader Trotsky represented the leading contenders for party and state primacy. The eloquent Trotsky was identified by the three other leading contenders to the throne as a most serious political threat and a temporary alliance was formed by the trio against Trotsky. Over the next several years Trotsky and his supporters were successively marginalized and isolated by the evolving Soviet leadership group, with Trotsky vilified as a political oppositionist and his supporters atomized by political and police pressure. This process was accentuated by successive exiles of Trotsky, first in 1928 to the remote city of Alma Ata in Soviet Central Asia followed the next year by Trotsky's physical expulsion from the Soviet Union to Turkey. Although separated from his dwindling band of committed followers in the USSR, Trotsky continued to function as an opposition political leader from exile throughout the rest of his life. This ongoing political activity against the regime headed by Joseph Stalin led to ongoing political pressure by the Soviet government against a series of host countries in which Trotsky had sought exile. The writing development Leon Trotsky as he appeared in the 1920s. In the spring of 1935 a beleaguered Trotsky formally sought political asylum in the Scandinavian kingdom of Norway with an appeal to the Labour Party government in power.Isaac Deutscher, The Prophet Outcast: Trotsky: 1929-1940. London: Oxford University Press, 1963; pg. 290. The Norwegian response was slow, and only in early June was Trotsky at last notified that his request had been granted and that he was to proceed to the Norwegian embassy in Paris to obtain a visa. Norwegian politics intervened before Trotsky was able to obtain this document, however, and the visa approval was revoked by the time Trotsky arrived at the embassy on June 10. French police, suspecting a ruse by Trotsky to obtain residence in Paris, from which he had been banned, immediately ordered Trotsky out of the city. Trotsky's planned voyage to Norway was abruptly cancelled. Norwegian authorities demanded that Trotsky obtain a permit for reentry into France before a visa for travel to Norway would be granted.Deutscher, The Prophet Outcast, pg. 291. Finally, after a burst of correspondence and negotiation, the demand for an unobtainable French re-entry permit was dropped and Trotsky was allowed a limited six month visa to enter Norway. As was the case with the terms previously set by the French government, the Norwegian government reserved for itself the right to determine Trotsky's place of residence and to exclude him from the capital city of Oslo.Deutscher, The Prophet Outcast, pg. 292. He arrived on June 18, 1935. The Revolution Betrayed was completed and sent to the publisher on 4 August 1936, immediately prior to the sensational public announcement of the first of three great public Moscow Trials generated by the secret police terror known to history as the \\"Great Purge\\" (Yezhovshchina').Leon Trotsky, \\"Introduction,\\" to The Revolution Betrayed. New York: Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1937; pg. 4. When Trotsky became aware of the trial, which would ultimately end in the execution of Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, and other prominent Soviet political figures, a short postscript was tagged on to his introduction in which Trotsky claimed that his current book constituted \\"advance exposure\\" of the Stalin regime's effort at \\"deliberate mystification.\\" Content The Revolution Betrayed has been characterized by historian Baruch Knei-Paz as Trotsky's \\"major work on Stalinism\\" and constituted the chief primary source for a chapter length summary of Trotsky's thinking on bureaucracy in a seminal 1978 intellectual survey.Baruch Knei-Paz, The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky. Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, 1978; pg. 381; fn. 39. In the view of Knei-Paz, the subtitle chosen by Trotsky for The Revolution Betrayed ‚Äî \\"What is the Soviet Union and where is it going?\\" ‚Äî accurately summarized the author's intent behind the book.Knei- Paz, The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky, pg. 385. Trotsky was preoccupied with the question of whether the emerging bureaucratic political and economic formation in the USSR constituted a new social model not encompassed previously by Marxist doctrine. Knei-Paz asserted that while Trotsky insisted that the Soviet system did not constitute any such new social and economic system, in reality the analysis he presented in The Revolution Betrayed was, in fact, \\"ambivalent.\\" The book is a wide-ranging critique of the USSR and its rulers, and advocates a new political revolution to overthrow the Stalinist dictatorship and bring about a socialist democracy. It opens by praising the positive economic advances of the USSR since the death of Lenin, citing growth in electrical power, agricultural output, industry, etc. It then proceeds to describe the limits on this economic advance, the nature of the new ruling elite, and predicts the ultimate downfall of the Soviet Union as a result of Stalinist rule. It places an emphasis on a Marxist method of analysis, and makes several key observations and predictions, some of which would only be borne out many decades later. The first few chapters examine the \\"zigzags,\\" as Trotsky describes them, in the policy pursued by the Party, citing rapid panicked changes in policy as a direct result of a lack of democracy. Trotsky highlights the most important of these 'zigzags' in the field of economic policy, criticizing Stalin and Bukharin's policy of at first opposing voluntary collectivization and increasing privatization of land and then of an abrupt U-turn to break-neck industrialisation and forced collectivisation, which Trotsky brands \\"economic adventurism\\" that carried \\"the nation to the edge of disaster\\". Trotsky then discusses labor productivity and criticizes the uselessness of the Stakhanovite movement and \\"shock brigades.\\" Trotsky then analyzes \\"The Soviet Thermidor\\" (Thermidor is a reference to the later stages of the French Revolution, when conservative forces took hold of society). He analyzes the triumph of Stalin, the separation of the party from Bolshevism, and the rising bureaucratic stratum. The importance of this chapter lies in Trotsky's observation that the ruling stratum in the USSR are neither capitalists nor workers, but rather a section of the working class alienated from its class roots, influenced both by the bureaucracy left over from the Tsarist era and the de-politicisation of the working class. Trotsky refers to Stalinism as a form of \\"Bonapartism,\\" drawing a comparison with the French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte and his capture of the French state after that country's revolution. Just as Bonaparte brought back the trappings of the aristocracy and imprisoned capitalists despite presiding over a new capitalist social system, Stalin imprisons workers and behaves like a Tsar despite failing to overturn the gains of a planned economy and nominal public ownership. At the same time, Trotsky writes that this ruling stratum impoverishes the rest of society, asserting that \\"a planned economy requires democracy just as the human body requires oxygen\\"; without democracy, he predicts economic stagnation. He next discusses everyday life in the Soviet Union, economic inequality and the oppression of the new proletariat. He links the increasing conservatism in the treatment of women and the family directly with the rise of Stalinism, and compares it to the period before the revolution. From here he discusses foreign policy and the Soviet military: The failure to defeat fascism, the re-institution of ranks and the loss of a militia, and closes by examining the future of the Soviet Union. One of the key predictions made by Trotsky is that the USSR would come before a disjuncture: either the toppling of the ruling bureaucracy by means of a political revolution, or capitalist restoration led by the bureaucracy. This prediction was made at a time when most commentators, capitalist and Stalinist, predicted the continued rise of Soviet power. As Allin Cottrell and Paul Cockshott would later write in their 1992 book Towards a New Socialism, Trotsky's prediction proved prescient. Lack of economic democracy coupled with computer technology that (at the time) was not yet advanced enough to plan the economy led to economic stagnation in the 1960s and 1970s (The Era of Stagnation). Leading members of the ruling party (who were overwhelmingly from the more privileged stratum of Soviet society) responded to the stagnation by promoting capitalist reforms in the 1980s, rather than expanding more democratic forms of socialism.http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/soviet_planning.pdf This was followed by the full embrace of capitalism a decade later without any apparent ideological discomfort amongst former party members, who became the new economic oligarchs in post-Soviet Russia while living standards of the Soviet proletariat fell precipitously in the 1990s.

It initially formed part of the Russian Republic, and proclaimed its independence from the Russian Soviet Republic on 25 January 1918.Serhy Yekelchyk, Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation, Oxford University Press (2007), During its short existence the republic went through several political transformations - from the socialist-leaning republic headed by the Central Council with its general secretariat to the national republic led by the Directorate and by Symon Petliura. Between April and December 1918 the Ukrainian People's Republic did not function, having been overthrown by the pro-German Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadsky, who proclaimed himself Hetman. From late 1919 the UNR operated as an ally of the Second Polish Republic, but by then the state de facto no longer existed in Ukraine. The 18 March 1921 Treaty of Riga between the Second Polish Republic, Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus) and of Soviet Ukraine sealed the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic. After the October Revolution, many governments formed in Ukraine ‚Äì most notably the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets (1917‚Äì1918, based in Kharkiv) and its Soviet successors. This force, along with the Ukrainian Republic (based in Kyiv), plus the White Movement, Poland, Green armies and the Anarchists, fought constantly with each other, which resulted in many casualties among Ukrainians fighting in a 1917‚Äì21 Ukrainian Civil War as part of the wider Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì23. The Bolsheviks would (after the 1921 Treaty of Riga) extend control over what would ultimately become the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and (in 1922) a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1992, two days before the first anniversary of post-Soviet Ukraine, President-in-exile Plaviuk resigned, recognizing the new government a legal successor to the UNR and handing over his authorities to President Kravchuk.  History  =Revolutionary wave= A February 1918 article from The New York Times shows a map of the Russian Imperial territories claimed by Ukraine People's Republic at the time, before the annexation of the Austro- Hungarian lands of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. On 10 June 1917, the Ukrainian Central Council declared its autonomy as part of the Russian Republic by its First Universal at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress. The highest governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic became the General Secretariat headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The Prime Minister of Russia Alexander Kerensky recognized the Secretariat, appointing it as the representative governing body of the Russian Provisional Government and limiting its powers to five governorates: Volyn, Kyiv, Podolie, Chernigov, and Poltova. At first Vynnychenko protested and left his post as Secretariat leader, but eventually returned to reassemble the Secretariat after the Tsentralna Rada accepted the Kerensky Instruktsiya and issued the Second Universal. After the October Revolution the Kyivan faction of the Bolshevik Party instigated the uprising in Kyiv on 8 November 1917 in order to establish Soviet power in the city. Kyiv Military District forces attempted to stop it, but after the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kyiv. After expelling the government forces, the Rada announced a wider autonomy for the Ukrainian Republic, still maintaining ties to Russia, on 22 November 1917. The territory of the republic was proclaimed by the Third Universal 20 November 1917 (7 November by Old Style)The Third Universal in the archives of the Verkhovna Rada of the Tsentralna Rada encompassing the governorates: Volyn, Kyiv, Podolie, Chernigov, Poltava, Kharkov, Yekaterinoslav, Kerson, Taurida (not including Crimea). It also stated that the people of the governorates: Voronezh, Kholm, and Kursk were welcome to join the republic through a referendum. Further the Tsentralna Rada in its Universal stated that because there was no Government in the Russian Republic after the October Revolution it proclaimed itself the Supreme governing body of the territory of Ukraine until order in the Russian republic could be restored. The Central Rada called all revolutionary activities such as the October Revolution a civil war and expressed its hopes for the resolution of the chaos. After a brief truce, the Bolsheviks realized that the Rada had no intention of supporting the Bolshevik Revolution. They re-organized into an All-Ukrainian Council of Soviets in December 1917 in an attempt to seize power. When that failed due to the Bolsheviks' relative lack of popularity in Kyiv, they moved to Kharkiv. The Bolsheviks of Ukraine declared the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic outlawed and proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets with capital in Kyiv, claiming that the government of the People's Secretaries of Ukraine was the only government in the country. The Bolshevik Red Army entered Ukraine from the Russian SFSR in support of the local Soviet government. As the relationships between members within the Tsentralna Rada soured, a series of regional Soviet republics on the territory of Ukraine proclaimed their independence and allegiance to the Petrograd sovnarkom (Odessa Soviet Republic (southern Ukraine), Donetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic (eastern Ukraine)). The Donetsk-Kryvoi Rog Republic was created by a direct decree of Lenin as part of the Russian SFSR with its capital in Kharkiv. That decree was successfully implemented by Fyodor Sergeyev who became the chairman of the local government as well as joining the Soviet government of Ukraine, simultaneously. Unlike Fyodor Sergeyev's Republic, the Odessa Republic was not recognized by any other Bolshevik governments and on its own initiative had entered a military conflict with Romania for control over the Moldavian Democratic Republic, whose territory it was contesting. 1919 Ukraine People's Republic Diplomatic passport issued for serving in Switzerland =Timeline= The following information is based on the exposition of the Museum of Soviet occupation in Kyiv (Memorial (society) in Kyiv)Official website of Kyiv Memorial Spring 1917 * 8‚Äì12 March ‚Äì February Revolution in the Russian Empire, victory of the democratic forces * 17 March ‚Äì establishment of the Ukrainian Central Council * 4 April ‚Äì recreation of Prosvita, establishment of the Ukrainian Cooperative Committee, and the Temporary Military Council, liberation of the people of Galicia, particularly Andrei Sheptytsky * 9 April ‚Äì Mykhailo Hrushevsky returns from exile to head the Ukrainian Central Council * 10 April ‚Äì the Ukrainian Central Council supported the convocation of the Ukrainian National Congress * 11 April ‚Äì establishment of the Ukrainian Military Society of Hetman Polubotok headed by Mykola Mikhnovsky, organization of the 1st Ukrainian Volunteer Regiment of Bohdan Khmelnytsky * 13 April ‚Äì a big demonstration took place in Kyiv with over 100,000 people, establishment of the Ukrainian National Council in Petrograd * 2‚Äì4 May ‚Äì the Ukrainian National Congress took place in Kyiv, involving about 900 delegates, the Congress confirmed the composition of the Ukrainian Central Council of 150 members headed by Mykhailo Hrushevsky * 17 May ‚Äì the commander of the Southwestern Front General Brusilov permitted the organization of the Bohdan Khmelnytsky Regiment which drafted 3,574 volunteers * 18 ‚Äì 1 May Ukrainian Military Congress took place in Kyiv attended by over 700 delegates.

The All-Ukrainian Agrarian Congress elects Pavlo Skoropadsky the Hetman of Ukraine =Independence= Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (9 February 1918): Due to the aggression from Soviet Russia, on 25 January 1918, the Tsentralna Rada issued its Fourth Universal (dated 22 January 1918), breaking ties with Bolshevik Russia and proclaiming a sovereign Ukrainian state.Serhy Yekelchyk, Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation, Oxford University Press (2007), , p. 72 Less than a month later, on 9 February 1918, the Red Army seized Kyiv. Besieged by the Bolsheviks and having lost much territory, the Rada was forced to seek foreign aid, and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 9 February 1918 to obtain military help from the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. Germany helped the Ukrainian Army force the Bolsheviks out of Ukraine. On 20 February 1918 the council of the Kuban People's Republic accepted the resolution for a federal union of Kuban with Ukraine as Bolshevik forces pushed towards Yekaterinodar. It was agreed to forward the resolution for ratification to the Ukrainian government. After the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Ukraine became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire which at that time seemed more favorable than being overrun by the Soviet forces that were spreading havoc in the country. Germany was anxious about losing the war and was trying to speed up the process of food extraction from Ukraine, so it decided to install its own administration in the person of Generalfeldmarschall von Eichhorn who replaced the Colonel General Alexander von Linsingen. On 6 April the commander of the Army group Kijew issued an order in which he explained his intentions to execute the conditions of the treaty. That, of course, conflicted with the laws of the Ukrainian government, which annulled his order. By April 1918 the German-Austrian Operation Faustschlag offensive had completely removed the Bolsheviks from Ukraine. 100 years ago Bakhmut and the rest of Donbass liberated, Ukrayinska Pravda (18 April 2018)Germany Takes Control of Crimea, New York Herald (18 May 1918)War Without Fronts: Atamans and Commissars in Ukraine, 1917‚Äì1919 by Mikhail Akulov, Harvard University, August 2013 (pp. 102 and 103) The German/Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were due to the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts. The Germans arrested and disbanded the Tsentralna Rada on 29 April 1918 to stop the social reforms that were taking place and retarding the process of food supply transfer to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The German authorities also arrested the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vsevolod Holubovych, on terrorist charges, and thus disbanded the Council of People's Ministers. Prior to this, the Rada had approved the Constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Concurrently with all these events and a few days prior to the change of powers in the country on 24 April 1918 the government of Belarus confirmed the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce in Kyiv headed by Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky on the initiative of the Belarusian secretary of finance Pyotr Krechevsky.Babushka with a red wagon =Hetmanate= thumb250pxMay‚ÄìNovember, 1918: After the coup, the Rada was replaced by the conservative government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian People's Republic by a \\"Ukrainian State\\" (Ukrayinska derzhava). Skoropadsky, a former officer of the Russian Empire, established a regime favoring large landowners and concentrating power at the top. The government had little support from Ukrainian activists, but unlike the socialist Rada, it was able to establish an effective administrative organization, established diplomatic ties with many countries, and concluded a peace treaty with Soviet Russia. In a few months, the Hetmanate also printed millions of Ukrainian language textbooks, established many Ukrainian schools, two universities, and the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. The Hetmanate government also supported the confiscation of previously-nationalized peasant lands by wealthy estate owners, often with the help of German troops. This led to unrest, the rise of a peasant partisan (guerrilla) movement, and a series of large-scale popular armed revolts. Negotiations were held to garner support from previous Rada members Petliura and Vynnychenko, but these activists worked to overthrow Skoropadsky. On 30 July, a Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionary, Boris Mikhailovich Donskoy, with help from the local USRP succeeded in assassinating von Eichhorn, blowing him up in downtown Kyiv at a broadlight. Due to the impending loss of World War I by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Skoropadsky's sponsors, the Hetman formed a new cabinet of Russian Monarchists and committed to federation with a possible future non-Bolshevik Russia. In response, the Ukrainian socialists announced a new revolutionary government, the Directorate, on 14 November 1918. =Timeline= Spring 1918 * 29 April ‚Äì All-Ukrainian Agrarian Congress elects Pavlo Skoropadsky as the Hetman of Ukraine * 30 April ‚Äì Mykola Vasylenko was appointed the Chairman of Council of Ministers and tasked with the formation of government * 7 May ‚Äì the Council of Ministers confirmed its intentions to add Crimea to the Ukrainian State * 15 May ‚Äì Signing of a treaty between governments of Ukraine from one side and Germany and Austria-Hungary from another to provide a loan in amount of 400 million karbovanets for acquiring the Ukrainian food * 18 May ‚Äì the Council of Ministers adopted the law about a creation of the State Guard * 23 May ‚Äì started peace negotiations between representatives of Ukraine and Russia * 28 May ‚Äì to Kyiv arrived the plenipotentiary delegation of the Regional Council of Kuban headed by Mykola Ryabovol with proposition of unification of Kuban with Ukraine * 30 May ‚Äì the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Doroshenko petitioned with a special letter to the Ambassador of Germany in Ukraine, baron Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein, to include Crimea to Ukraine Summer 1918 * 12 June ‚Äì the Congress of Landowners and Agrarians of Tavria Governorate that took place in Simferopol supported the proposition to include Tavria to Ukraine * 20 June ‚Äì the All- Ukrainian Church Council took place in Kyiv * 1 July ‚Äì adopted the decision about a creation of the Ukrainian university in Kamianets-Podilsky * 2 July ‚Äì adoption of the law about citizenship of the Ukrainian State * 8 July ‚Äì creation of the State Senate of the Ukrainian State as the supreme judicial institution * 9 July ‚Äì creation of the commission in development of project of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences * 10 July ‚Äì Kyiv Orthodox clergy lifted the anathema on Hetman Mazepa * 24 July ‚Äì Ukraine and Germany ratified the Brest Peace Treaty, adoption of laws about the general military obligation, criminal responsibility for exceeding the maximum established prices and speculation, appointments to government service * 27 July ‚Äì due to the anti-Ukrainian policies of the Crimean government of Sulkevich the Ukrainian State established an economical blockade of the peninsula * 1 August ‚Äì adoption of laws about supreme government and political position of military servicemen * 2 August ‚Äì adoption of the law about the creation of fund of the National Library of Ukrainian State * 6 August ‚Äì the All-Ukrainian Church Council called for the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Church * 10 August ‚Äì confirmed the statute of the Ukrainian State Bank and its base and reserve capitals * 17 August ‚Äì adopted the law about a restriction on import of the Russian monetary units * 22 August ‚Äì in Vienna Turkey and Ukraine exchanged documents that ratified the Brest Peace Treaty * 10 September ‚Äì signing of an economic agreement between Ukraine, Germany, Austria-Hungary for the 1918‚Äì1919 fiscal years * 18 September ‚Äì temporary stop of custom war with Crimea on the petition of the Sulkevich government * 5 October ‚Äì in Kyiv started negotiations between Ukraine and Crimea about the conditions of Crimea inclusion to Ukraine * 6 October ‚Äì Kyiv State Ukrainian University is opened * 16 October ‚Äì Hetman of Ukraine issued declaration on the revival of cossackdom * 17 October ‚Äì adopted a declaration about organization of volunteer militia on upholding the order of law * 21 October ‚Äì Hetman of Ukraine met with the extraordinary mission of the Kuban regional government headed by Colonel V.

Language map published by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1914 The Directorate gained massive popularity, and the support of some of Skoropadsky's military units including the Serdiuk Division. Their insurgent army encircled Kyiv on 21 November. After a three-week-long stalemate Skoropadsky abdicated in favor of the Council of Ministers who surrendered to the Revolutionary forces. On 19 December 1918, the Directorate took control of Kyiv. The Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine from Kursk in late December 1918 where the new Ukrainian Soviet government was reestablished earlier in November of the same year. On 16 January 1919 Ukraine officially declared a war on Russia while the Russian Soviet government continued to deny all claims of invasion. On 22 January 1919, the Directorate was officially united with the West Ukrainian People's Republic, although the latter entity de facto maintained its own army and government. In February 1919, the Bolsheviks captured Kyiv. Throughout 1919, Ukraine experienced chaos as the armies of the Ukrainian Republic, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the foreign powers of the Entente, and Poland, as well as anarchist forces such as that of Nestor Makhno tried to prevail. The subsequent Kyiv Offensive, staged by the Polish army and allied Ukrainian forces, was unable to change the situation, and in March 1921, the Peace of Riga sealed a shared control of the territory by Poland, the Russian SFSR, and the Ukrainian RSR. As the result, the lands of Galicia (Halychyna) as well as a large part of the Volhynian territory were incorporated into Poland, while the areas to the east and south became part of Soviet Ukraine. After its military and political defeat, the Directorate continued to maintain control over some of its military forces.

On 4 November, the Directorate's guerrillas captured Korosten and seized much military supplies. But on 17 November 1921, this force was surrounded by Bolshevik cavalry and destroyed. =Timeline= Winter 1918‚Äì19 * 14 December ‚Äì the Directorate of Ukraine received the state powers in Ukraine after the Hetman of Ukraine emigrated to Germany * 16 December ‚Äì the Directorate renewed the law about National-Individual Autonomy * 19 December ‚Äì the grand entry of Directorate to the capital of Ukraine.

According to Cheka documentation, in Ukraine took place 268 uprisings from 1917 through 1932, where in over 100 raions the mutinied peasants were killing chekists, communists, and prodotryads that were requisitioning food by force which more resembled expropriation.People's War (Ukrainian pravda, photos) (Ukrainian) * Free Territory (Nestor Makhno) * Otaman Grigoriev * Otaman Oskilko Affair (Volodymyr Oskilko) * Otaman Zelenyi Uprising * Kholodnyi Yar (Cold Ravine) * Otaman Kamenyuka * Free Cossacks (Semen Hryzlo) * Zazymia UprisingLeft-bank Uprisings (Ukrainian pravda) (Ukrainian) (Troyeshchyna) - Otaman Romashka and Otaman Anhel against Kyiv and Chernihiv Cheka and Bashkir Cavalry Brigade * Anti-Red Army ambush near Uman in 1920Festival in Lehedzyne (Ukrainian pravda) (Ukrainian) International recognition The Ukrainian People's Republic was recognized de jure in February 1918 by the Central Powers of World War I (Austria-Hungary, Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria)TERMS OF PEACE MADE BY UKRAINE; New Republic Gets Increased Territory at Expense of Rest of Russia, The New York Times, 12 February 1918 (PDF) and by Bolshevik Russia, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Georgia, Azerbaijan, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the Holy See.

Later in 1918 Russia chose to withdraw its recognition of independent Ukraine, representing the protocols of the Versailles Treaty as justification for its action.

Armed forces The headquarters of the republic's armed forces was called the General Bulawa and was considered to be located in Kyiv. Of course, due to constant intervention from the Petrograd sovnarkom and the German Empire the physical location of it was changing (Kamyanets-Podilsky, Bila Tserkva, others). =Main military formations (UPR)= * Sich Riflemen ** Ukrainian Sich Riflemen were a similar unit, however, that unit wasn't part of Ukrainian military * Free Cossacks The following three Zaporizhian infantry regiments and the 3 Haidamaka Regiment of the biggest Ukrainian military formation, the Zaporizhian Corps, later were reorganized into the 1 Zaporizhian Division. * Zaporizhian Corps * Ukrainian Steppe Division (Anti-Bolshevik revolutionary- military unit) * Ukrainian Marines * 1 Riflemen-Cavalry Division (Gray-Coats) * Blue-Coats * Sloboda Ukraine Haidamaka Kosh * 3 Iron Riflemen Division * Ukrainian People's Republic Air Fleet * Ukrainian Navy =Main military formations (WUPR)= * Ukrainian Galician Army, was a military formation of the West Ukrainian People's Republic Money and banking In December 1918 a temporary law about the issue of state banknotes by the UPR was adopted.

Conversely, modern Ukrainian historians consider it a failed war of independence by the Ukrainian People's Republic against the Russian Soviet Republic, ending with Ukraine falling under a Russian-Soviet occupation. Historiography In Soviet historiography and terminology, the armed conflict is depicted as part of the greater Russian Civil War: in Ukraine, this war was fought between the national government (led by Symon Petliura) and the Bolshevik government (led by Lenin). The war may be divided into three phases: # December 1917 ‚Äì April 1918: Revolutionary days, Bolshevik uprisings, invasion of the Red Guards formations, signing of protectorate treaty, and liberation from bolsheviks. # December 1918 ‚Äì December 1919: Civil war in Ukraine, invasion of the Red Army, unification of Ukraine, anti-Soviet peasant uprisings, Denikin's Volunteer Army and the Allied intervention, loss of West Ukraine to Poland. # Spring 1920 ‚Äì Autumn 1921: Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (Treaty of Warsaw), Russian Civil War (between Bolsheviks armies and the Armed Forces of South Russia), Ukrainian guerrilla operations (First and Second Winter Campaigns), government in exile. =Important documents= * Declarations of the Central Council of Ukraine (Universals) * Ultimatum of Sovnarkom to the Central Council of Ukraine * Treaty of Brest-Litovsk granting status of neutrality to Ukraine as a bufferzone for the Central Powers, as well as military protection, in negotiating peace with the Bolsheviks of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. * Unification Act, unification of the western Ukraine * Treaty of Warsaw, Polish-Ukrainian anti-Bolshevik pact * Peace of Riga, splitting of Ukraine Background After the February Revolution of 1917 the nationalities within the tsarist empire (renamed the Russian Republic) demanded national autonomy from Petrograd. In summer of 1917 the Provisional government approved regional administration over some parts of former tsarist Ukraine. In October 1917 the government of Ukraine denounced the Bolsheviks' armed revolt and declared it would decisively fight against any attempted coup in Ukraine. A special joint committee for preservation of revolution was organized to keep the situation under control. The Kiev Military District command tried to prevent a Bolshevik coup, leading to street fights and eventually surrendering of pro-Bolshevik troops in the city. On November 14, 1917 the Ukrainian Central Rada issued its \\"Appeal of the Central Council to the citizens of Ukraine\\" in which it sanctioned transfer of the state power in Ukraine to itself. On November 16 a joint session of the Rada and executive committee of the local workers and soldiers soviets recognized the Central Rada as the regional authority in Ukraine. On November 20, 1917 the Rada declared Ukraine the Ukrainian People's Republic as an autonomous part of the Russian Republic and scheduled on January 9, 1918 elections to a Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The Secretary of Military Affairs Symon Petliura expressed his intentions to unite both the Southwestern and Romanian fronts that were stretched across Ukraine into one Ukrainian Front under the command of Colonel General Dmitry Shcherbachev. On December 17, 1917 Bolsheviks planned an All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets and on December 11‚Äì12, 1917 set off a number of uprisings across Ukraine in Kiev, Odessa, Vinnytsia. They were successfully defeated by the Rada. On December 17, 1917 Sovnarkom, that initiated peace talks with Central Powers earlier that month, sent a 48-hour ultimatum to the Rada requesting it stop \\"counterrevolutionary actions\\" or prepare for war. Also on December 17, 1917 Reingold Berzins led his troops from Minsk towards Kharkiv to Don. They engaged in an armed conflict at a rail station in Bakhmach with the Ukrainian troops who refused to let the Red forces (three regiments and an artillery division) pass. The Central Rada did not accept the accusations and stated its conditions: recognition of the Ukrainian People's Republic, non-interference in its internal affairs and affairs of the newly organized the Ukrainian Front, permission on transferring of Ukrainized troops to Ukraine, division of the former imperial finances, participation of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the general peace negotiations. The same day the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kiev, after the Bolshevik delegation left, recognized the authority of the Ukrainian government and denounced the ultimatum of the Russian government. The Kiev Bolsheviks in their turn denounced that congress and scheduled another one in Kharkiv. Next day, Sovnarkom in Moscow decided for war. Vladimir Antonov- Ovseyenko was appointed the commander-in-chief of expeditionary force against Kaledin and the South Russia, while near the borders with Ukraine (Bryansk ‚Äì Belgorod) Red troops began to gather. The Kievan Bolsheviks who fled to Kharkiv joined the regional Congress of Soviets of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic. They then declared this meeting the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets that announced the creation of the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets. It called the Central Rada of Ukraine an enemy of the people declaring war against it on January 2. The Rada then broke all ties with Petrograd on January 22, 1918, and declared independence, thereby commencing the Ukrainian War of Independence. It was around this point that Bolshevik troops began invading Ukraine from Russia.Orest Subtelny. Ukraine a History. University of Toronto Press, 1988.

War =December 1917 ‚Äì April 1918= The Bolsheviks, numbering around 30,000 and composed of Russian army regulars stationed at the front, a number of garrisoned units, and Red Guard detachments composed of laborers from Kharkov gubernia and the Donbass, began by advancing from the northeast led by Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko and Mikhail Muravyov.Nicholas Chirovsky. An introduction to Ukrainian History Volume III 19th and 20th Century Ukraine. New York, Philosophical Library, 1986 The Ukrainian forces at the time of the invasion consisted of about 15,000 made up from volunteer detachments and several battalions of the Free Cossacks and the Sichovi Stril'tsi. The invasion of pro-Soviet forces from Russia was accompanied by uprisings initiated in Ukraine by the local Bolsheviks in the developed cities throughout the territory of Left-bank Ukraine as well as Right-bank Ukraine. The Bolsheviks led by Yevgenia Bosch conducted a successful uprising in Vinnytsia sometime in December 1917. They took charge of the 2nd Guard Corps and moved towards Kiev to help the Bolsheviks in the city. Pavlo Skoropadsky with a regiment of the Free Cossacks managed to stop them near Zhmerynka, disarm them, and deport them to Russia. The other Bolshevik forces captured Kharkiv (December 26), Yekaterinoslav (January 9), Aleksandrovsk (January 15), and Poltava (January 20) on their way to Kiev. On January 27, the Bolshevik army groups converged in Bakhmach and then set off under the command of Muravyov to take Kiev.Ukrainian-Soviet War, 1917‚Äì21 at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine The first detachment of Sich Riflemen after the capture of Kiev in January 1918. As the Bolsheviks marched towards Kiev, a small Ukrainian National Republic unit of less than 500 schoolboys (some sources give a figure of 300), commanded by Captain Ahapiy Honcharenko, was hastily organized and sent to the front on January 29, 1918 to take part in the Battle of Kruty. The small unit consisted mainly of the Student Battalion (Kurin) of Sich Riflemen, a unit of the Khmelnytsky Cadet School, and a Haidamaka detachment. About half of the 500 men were killed during the battle. On January 29, 1918, the Kiev Arsenal January Uprising, a Bolshevik-organized armed revolt, began at the Kiev Arsenal factory. The workers of the plant were joined by the soldiers of the Ponton Battalion, the 3rd Aviation Regiment and the Sagaydachny regiment. Sensing defeat, the \\"Central Rada\\" and Petlyurist forces stormed the city on February 3. After six days of battle and running low on food and ammunition, the uprising was suppressed by counter-revolutionary forces, in which 300 Bolshevik workers died. According to Soviet era sources, more than 1500 pro- Soviet workers and soldiers were killed during the struggle.–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –ê–≥–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á –ß—É–≥–∞–µ–≤. \\"–ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è: –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –°–æ—é–∑–∞ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫\\". –ú—ã—Å–ª—å. 1972. p.176 On February 8 the Ukrainian government evacuated Kiev in order to avoid destruction by opposing Soviet troops, which then entered Kiev under Mikhail Muravyov's on February 9. Once the Bolsheviks took Kiev, they began an offensive in Right-Bank Ukraine. However, on February 9 the UNR signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and thus received aid from German and Austro-Hungarian troops in late February, over 450,000 troops. In exchange for military aid, the Ukrainians were to deliver foodstuffs to the Central Powers. Under the command of Symon Petlura, the combined forces pushed the Bolsheviks out of Right Bank Ukraine and retook Kiev on March 1. Because of the socialist policies of the Rada, mainly the policy of land nationalization which affected food exports to the Central Powers, on April 28 the German forces disbanded the Tsentralna Rada and installed the Hetman government in its place. Ukrainian, German, and Austro-Hungarian armies continued making gains, taking back Left Bank Ukraine, Crimea and the Donets Basin.. 100 years ago Bakhmut and the rest of Donbass liberated, Ukrayinska Pravda (18 April 2018) These setbacks forced the Bolsheviks to sign a peace treaty with the Ukrainian government on June 12. Post-Hetmanate intervention Polish‚ÄìUkrainian, Polish‚ÄìSoviet and Ukraine‚ÄìSoviet Wars in early 1919 During November 1918, troops from the Directorate of Ukraine overthrew the Hetmanate with some help from the Bolsheviks. German forces led by the Soldatenrat kept their neutrality during the two-week-long civil war as they were withdrawing from the country, due to the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. The Directorate reestablished the Ukrainian People's Republic. On January 22, 1919 the neighboring Ukrainian Republics united under the Act Zluky. The Central Military-Revolutionary Committee in Kursk on October 22, 1918 issued the order to form two divisions under the Army Group the Ukrainian Front or the Group of the Kursk Direction. The group was assigned the Worker's Division of Moscow, the 9th Soviet Division, 2nd Orlov Brigade, and two armored trains. According to Antonov-Ovsiyenko the Army accounted for some 6,000 soldiers, 170 artillery guns, 427 machine guns, 15 military planes, and 6 armored trains. On December 15, 1918 the meeting of the Ukrainian chief of staff was called in Kiev headed by Otaman Osetsky and including the Chief Otaman Petliura, Colonel Bolbachan, Colonel Shapoval, Sotnik Oskilko. They were discussing the border security and formed a plan in case of threat from all sides. To stop the coming war with the Bolsheviks, the government of Chekhivsky sent a delegation to Moscow led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Semen Mazurenko. The delegation succeeded in signing a preliminary peaceful agreement yet it did not stop the aggression from the Russian side due to poor communication between the delegation in Moscow and the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. On December 28, 1918 the Central Committee of the Left UPSR officially declared the mobilization of forces in the support of the Soviet government by an armed staging. From the beginning of January 1919 the Bolshevik bands consistently were crossing the eastern and north-eastern borders to raid. = January 1919 - June 1919 = On January 7, 1919 the Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine in full forcePaul Robert MagocsiA History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. with an army led by Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Joseph Stalin, and Volodymyr Zatonsky. The Directorate declared war once again against Russia on January 16 after several preliminary ultimatums to the Russian SFSR sovnarkom to withdraw their troops. The two main directions of the Bolshevik's forces were onto Kiev and Kharkiv. During that time the Soviet forces were advancing across North-eastern Ukraine and occupied Rylsk and Novhorod-Siversky. On December 21 the Ukrainian Front took the important strategic railroad connection in Kupyansk. After that, a full-scale advance started between the Dnieper and Oskol Rivers. On January 3, the Red Army took Kharkiv, almost as by the same scenario when Bolsheviks had occupied Kiev in February 1918. The Ukrainian forces at that time consisted of two regular troop formations, the Zaporozhian Corps and the Sich Riflemen, as well as partisan detachments. These partisans were led by unreliable atamans which occasionally sided with the Bolsheviks, such as Zeleny, Anhel, and Hryhoryev. The army which had over 100,000 men, fell to about 25,000 due to peasants leaving the army and desertions to the Bolsheviks. Bolbochan with the remnants of the Zaporizhian Corps retreated to Poltava which was holding off the Red Army for a couple of weeks more. On January 6, 1919 the government of Pyatakov officially declared the creation of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. Yet his government continued to stay in Kursk until January 24. On January 4 the Bolsheviks Army Group Ukrainian Front was reformed into the unified Ukrainian front under the command of Antonov-Ovsiyenko with his deputies Kotsiubynsky and Schadenko. On the several inquiries about the purpose of the Russian Army in Ukraine that the Directory was sending to Moscow, Chicherin finally responded on January 6: > ...there is no army of the Russian Socialist Soviet Republic in Ukraine. At > this time the military action that takes place on the territory of Ukraine > is between the armies of Directory and the Ukrainian Soviet Government which > is completely independent. On January 12, the troops under the command of Mykola Schors occupied Chernihiv while other units under command of Pavlo Dybenko took Lozova, Pavlohrad, Synelnykove, and established contact with Nestor Makhno. After some long discussion between the members of the Directory and other state officials, it was decided to declare War against Soviet Russia. The only person who was against it, was the chairman of the Directory Volodymyr Vynnychenko, while Shapoval, for example, for some reason was simply requesting the prompt creation of the Soviet government. Denikin later commented that the war declaration did not change absolutely anything on the frontlines and only reflected the political crisis inside the Ukrainian government with the victory of the military party of Petliura-Konovalets- Hrekov over Vynnychenko-Chekhivsky. On January 20 the Soviet Army took Poltava while the Ukrainian troops retreated further to Kremenchuk. On January 26 Dybenko took Katerynoslav. The Soviets took Left-Bank Ukraine, and then marched on to Kiev. On February 2 they forced the Directorate to move to Vinnytsia while troops of Schors and Bozhenko occupied Kiev three days later. Then Chekhivsky resigned from office, right after Vynnychenko has created in Kamyanets-Podilsky the Committee for the salvation of Republic, which was again dissolved by Petliura on February 13. During that time the Soviet troops has acquired the rest of the Kiev Governorate while the bands of Hryhoryev took Oleksandria and Yelyzavethrad. By March 6 the Directory has relocated to Proskurov while yielding most of Polissya and Podillya to the Bolsheviks. Surprisingly, by the end of March the Ukrainian armies successfully conducted series of military operations liberating Sarny, Zhytomyr, Korosten, and threatening to take back Kiev. On March 2 Otaman Hryhoryev occupied Kherson and March 12 he was already in Mykolaiv. By April 3 the Entente forces evacuated from Odessa which Hryhoryev entered three days later. =June 1919 - December 1919= By October 1919, about 70% of the Directorate's troops and more than 90% of the allied Ukrainian Galician Army fell to typhus. =December 1919 ‚Äì November 1920= From December 6, 1919 to May 6, 1920, the UNR Army under the command of Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko carried out an underground operation known as the First Winter Campaign in the Kirovohrad region against the Soviet 14th Army. Another significant development of this period was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw with Poland on April 22, and then beginning of a joint offensive with Polish troops against the Bolsheviks. On May 7, a Ukrainian division under the command of Marko Bezruchko entered Kiev, but was quickly forced out by a Red Army counteroffensive led by Semyon Budyonny. The Ukrainians and Poles were pushed back across the Zbruch River and past Zamo≈õƒá toward Warsaw. The Poles signed a peace with the Soviets on October 18. By 1921, the Polish author of the Polish-Ukrainian alliance, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, was no longer the Polish head of state, and only participated as an observer during the Riga negotiations, which he called an act of cowardice. (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.) Petliura's forces kept fighting.Mykhailo Hrushevsky, edited by O. J. Frederiksen. A History of Ukraine. New Haven: Yale University Press: 1941. They lasted until October 21, when they were forced to cross the Zbuch River and enter Polish-controlled Galicia. There they were disarmed and placed in internment camps. =November 1921= The last action of the UNR against the Soviets was a raid behind the Red Army lines in November 1921 known as the Second Winter Campaign. This campaign was meant to incite a general uprising amongst the Ukrainian peasants, who were already disgruntled with the Soviets, and to unify partisan forces against the Bolsheviks in Ukraine. The commander of the Ukrainian forces was Yurii Tiutiunnyk. Two expeditionary forces were established, one from Podolia (400 men) and one from Volhynia (800 men). The Podolia group only made it to the village of Vakhnivka, before returning to Polish territory through Volhynia on November 29. The Volhynia group started out on November 4, captured Korosten on November 7 and made its way to the village of Leonivka. When they began to run low on supplies they decided to return. However, on its return west, it was intercepted by a Bolshevik cavalry force under the command of Grigore Kotovski at Bazar and routed in battle near Mali Mynky on November 17. 443 soldiers were captured by the Soviets during the battle. 359 were shot on November 23 near the town of Bazar, and 84 were passed on to Soviet security forces.Winter Campaigns at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine This was the last operation of the UNR army against the Soviets. The end of the Second Winter Campaign brought the Ukrainian-Soviet war to a definite end, however partisan fighting against the Bolsheviks continued until mid-1922Partisan movement in Ukraine, 1918‚Äì22 at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine and in response the Red Army terrorized the countryside.WED Allen. The Ukraine. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1941. Aftermath Eastern Europe after the Treaty of Riga The end of the war saw the incorporation of most of the territories of Ukraine into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic which, on December 30, 1922, was one of the founding members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Parts of Western Ukraine fell into under the control of the Second Polish Republic, as laid out in the Peace of Riga. The UNR government, led by Symon Petlura, was forced into exile.Ukrainian National Republic at the Encyclopedia of Ukraine For the next few years the Ukrainian nationalists would continue to try to wage a partisan guerrilla war on the Soviets. They were aided by Polish intelligence (see Prometheism); however they were not successful. The last active Ukrainian movements would be mostly eradicated during the Holodomor.Timothy Snyder, Covert Polish Missions across the Soviet Ukrainian Border, 1928‚Äì1933, p. 71-78, in Cofini, Silvia Salvatici (a cura di), Rubbettino, 2005.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. , ‚Äì 10 February 1968) was a Russian, later American, sociologist and political activist, who contributed to the social cycle theory. Background Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin was born on , in Turya, a small village in Yarensky Uyezd, Vologda Governorate, Russian Empire (now Knyazhpogostsky District, Komi Republic, Russia), the second son to a Russian father and Komi mother. Sorokin's father, Alexander Prokopievich Sorokin, was from Veliky Ustyug and a travelling craftsman specializing in gold and silver, while his mother, Pelageya Vasilievna, was a native of Zheshart and belonged to a peasant family. His elder brother, Vasily, was born in 1885, and his younger brother, Prokopy, was born in 1893. Sorokin's mother died on March 7, 1894, in the village of Kokvitsa, and after her death Sorokin and his elder brother Vasily stayed with their father, travelling with him through the villages in search of work, while Prokopy was taken in by his aunt, Anisya Vasilievna Rimsky, who lived with her husband, Vasily Ivanovich, in the village of Rimia. Pitirim and his older brother's father developed alcoholism. Because of this, their father had severe anxiety and panic attacks to the point where he was physically abusive to his sons. After a severe beating that left a scar by Pitirim's upper lip, Pitirim at the age of eleven, along with his older brother, decided that wanted to be independent and no longer under their father's care. In the early 1900s, supporting himself as an artisan and clerk, Sorokin attended the Saint Petersburg Imperial University in Saint Petersburg where he earned his graduate degree in criminology and became a professor.Allen Phillip, J. (1963). Pitirim A. Sorokin in Review. Durham N.C. Duke University Press Sorokin was an anti-communist, and during the Russian Revolution was a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, supporter of the White Movement, and a secretary to Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky. After the October Revolution, Sorokin continued to fight communist leaders, and was arrested by the new regime several times before he was eventually condemned to death. After six weeks in prison, Sorokin was released and went back to teaching at the University of St. Petersburg, becoming the founder of the sociology department at the university. In 1922, Sorokin was again arrested and this time exiled by the Soviet government, emigrating in 1923 to the United States, and became a naturalized citizen in 1930. Sorokin was a leader among the Democrats leading up to the Russian revolution, and was sought by Lenin's forces after Lenin consolidated his power. After months in hiding, he escaped from the Soviet Union in 1922 and emigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1930. Sorokin was personally requested to accept a position at Harvard University, founding the Department of Sociology and becoming a vocal critic of his colleague, Talcott Parsons.Jeffries, Vincent. \\"Sorokin, Pitirim,\\" Encyclopedia of Social Theory. California: Sage Publications.In \\"Fads and Foibles,\\" Sorokin accuses Parsons of borrowing his work without acknowledgement. Sorokin was an ardent opponent of communism, which he regarded as a \\"pest of man,\\" and was a deputy of the Russian Constituent Assembly. Sorokin was professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota from 1924 to 1940, when he accepted an offer of a position by the president of Harvard University, where he continued to work until 1959. One of his students was writer Myra Page. Works and interests Before his achievements as a professor in the United States, he published his 1924 Leaves of a Russian Diary, by (E.P. Dutton & Co.), giving a daily, and sometimes hourly account of the Russian Revolution which actually first started in February 1917 where he was in the forefront of creating a provisionary government, only to see it unravel and lose power to the Bolsheviks in October 1917. In 1950, Sorokin published an addendum to the book called The Thirty Years After. It is a personal and brutally honest account of the revolution and of his exile. Sorokin's academic writings are extensive; he wrote 37 books and more than 400 articles. His controversial theories of social process and the historical typology of cultures are expounded in Social and Cultural Dynamics (4 vol., 1937‚Äì41; rev. and abridged ed. 1957) and many other works. Sorokin was also interested in social stratification, the history of sociological theory, and altruistic behavior. Sorokin's work addressed three major theories: social differentiation, social stratification and social conflict. The theory of social differentiation describes three types of societal relationships. The first is familistic, which is the type that we would generally strive for. It is the relationship that has the most solidarity, the values of everyone involved are considered, and there is a great deal of interaction. Social stratification refers to the fact that all societies are hierarchically divided, with upper and lower strata and unequal distribution of wealth, power, and influence across strata. There is always some mobility between these strata. People or groups may move up or down the hierarchy, acquiring or losing their power and influence. Social conflict refers to Sorokin's theory of war. Whether internal to a nation or international, peace is based on similarity of values among the people of a nation or between different nations. War has a destructive phase, when values are destroyed, and a declining phase, when some of values are restored. Sorokin thought that the number of wars would decrease with increased solidarity and decreased antagonism. If a society's values stressed altruism instead of egoism, the incidence of war would diminish. In his Social and Cultural Dynamics, his magnum opus, Sorokin classified societies according to their 'cultural mentality', which can be \\"ideational\\" (reality is spiritual), \\"sensate\\" (reality is material), or \\"idealistic\\" (a synthesis of the two). He suggested that major civilizations evolve from an ideational to an idealistic, and eventually to a sensate mentality. Each of these phases of cultural development not only seeks to describe the nature of reality, but also stipulates the nature of human needs and goals to be satisfied, the extent to which they should be satisfied, and the methods of satisfaction. Sorokin has interpreted the contemporary Western civilization as a sensate civilization, dedicated to technological progress and prophesied its fall into decadence and the emergence of a new ideational or idealistic era. In Fads and Foibles, he criticizes Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of Genius research, showing that his selected group of children with high IQs did about as well as a random group of children selected from similar family backgrounds would have done. Sorokin was heavily involved in politics; his interests being on the issues with the legitimacy of power, Russia's representative democracy, and how it connected to the national question of the country regarding its democratic structure. He believed that after the fall of communism, a new form of Russia would arise. He also believed that pushing Russia out of its crisis would encourage the world to utilize altruistic love; a vital part of his research. Sorokin also created the Center for the Study of Creative Altruism in Harvard and there he developed and proposed his ideas about the ethics of love and social solidarity. With this program he was able to express how humanity can be saved through altruistic actions made out of love.  Involvement with other sociologists  With the financial assistance of Eli Lilly, a friend of Sorokin who was a pharmaceutical heir, he was able to do further research in creative altruism. From this research, he gained much popularity and was well respected by other sociologists and in the field of sociology. He was referred to as the \\"founder of the sociology of altruism\\". Because of this, he was given the opportunity to create \\"The Harvard Research Center in Creative Altruism\\" in 1949 and had two instructors under him, one of them being Talcott Parsons. Although Sorokin and Parsons worked together as colleagues, Sorokin would heavily criticize Parsons' works due to having opposing views. Sorokin disapproved of America's ways of civilization and felt as if it was in decline hence creating tension between Sorokin and Parsons; Parsons being an American sociologist while Sorokin was Russian. The rift between them was put to a hold when Harvard University and the American sociology community favored Parsons views and Sorokin's administrative position in Harvard was seized. Sorokin's research also focused on rural society hence making him more approachable and referable by other moral conservatives. This initiated his collaboration with Carle Zimmerman and together they expanded on the perspective of rural-urban sociology. They believed that rural-urban sociology was the rural way of life that was established from the following characteristics: a conservative and traditional family, an economy based on manual labor and or from a family and home business and their connection to it whether it be sociologically, demographically, or economically.  Major impacts on influential figures  Sorokin impacted the historian, Allan Carlson. He agreed with Sorokin and his disapproval of communism. Carlson also considered himself to be pro-family, and agreed with Sorokin's views on how a family's most ideal environment is living in intimate, small village-like towns. Sorokin also made an influential impact on the forty-eighth vice president, Michael Pence, who quoted him while defending his failed House Resolution, the Marriage Protection Amendment in 2006, when there were same-sex marriages debates. Pence stated, \\"Marriage matters according to the researchers. Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin found that throughout history, the societal collapse was always brought about following the advent of the deterioration of marriage and family‚Äù.

Sorokin, co-invented the dye laser. Sorokin suffered from a serious illness and after struggling for two years, he died on 10 February 1968, aged 79, in Winchester, Massachusetts. A Russian Orthodox service was held at home for the family, followed by an eclectic service at the Memorial Church of Harvard University.Sergei P.

Sorokin had been imprisoned three times, condemned to death and finally exiled by Bolshevist government for that. What is the result of his study of Russian revolution? Book of Sorokin is, briefly, the most damning indictment of Bolshevist regime. This book is a careful study of revolution in general. It is one of the best descriptions of revolution ever written‚Äîthat of Thucydides on Corcyra‚Äîas it is with the events in France of the eighteenth century or Russia in the twentieth. Revolution is reversion of civilized people to savagery. History of creation The book Sociology of revolution was conceived by Sorokin in the years of Russian Civil War in 1917‚Äì1922. Sorokin started writing of this book in Prague in 1922. This book was published in the US in 1925. Sorokin was entitled the privatdozent of Petrograd university in January, 1917 . Sorokin became the editor of the newspaper of Socialist Revolutionary Party and the personal secretary of the prime minister Alexander Kerensky after February Revolution. Sorokin was arrested by Bolsheviks as the deputy of the Russian Constituent Assembly on January 2, 1918, Sorokin was compelled to disappear from the authorities after release from bolshevist prison. Then Sorokin had published the open letter in newspaper in which Sorokin states a failure of tactics of Socialist Revolutionary Party and Sorokin declares a gap with this party. Vladimir Lenin focused the attention on this letter in the Lenin's known article \\"Valuable Recognitions of Pitirim Sorokin\\".–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω \\"–¶–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –ü–∏—Ç–∏—Ä–∏–º–∞ –°–æ—Ä–æ–∫–∏–Ω–∞\\" Sorokin stopped being engaged in political activity and Sorokin resumed own teaching activity.

Bolshevik (1920), by Boris Kustodiev The theory of revolution was developed in Marxism too. Lenin's theory about the reasons for revolution, about the revolutionary situation resembles the Sorokin' theory partly, but theories of Lenin and Sorokin differ each other in the estimation of the value of this phenomenon as revolution sharply. Lenin considered that revolution is good; revolutions are \\"the festivals of the oppressed and the exploited\\".Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Two Tactics of Social- Democracy in the Democratic Revolution. page 113 Revolution is only method for such revolutionaries as Marx, Engels and Lenin to receive the authority without the elections, since the capitalist dictatorship would not allow a communist party to win in democractic elections. Marx named the revolutions as \\"the locomotives of history\\".Karl Marx The Class Struggles in France Chapter 3: Consequences of June 13, 1849 Sorokin and Hobbes considered that revolution is very bad. Sorokin considered that the revolution is the severe social illness, which can lead to death of social organism suddenly, that revolution is the worse method of an improvement of the life of masses. The revolutionaries promise to masses \\"gold mountains\\" in the words, but masses receive the hunger, the epidemics and the executions of innocent people in reality. The negligible results of revolution are reached by enormous price. Sorokin proposes other methods of improvement and reconstruction of the social organization: * The peaceful reforms, which don't jam the base instincts of man. * Scientific research must precede to practical experiment. * It need conduct the experiment on a low social scale at first. * Reforms must be carried out by lawful and constitutional means The conclusion: These canons are observed even under the erection of bridges and breeding of cattle. The inhabitant of distant planet, who observed the cataclysms of Russian revolution, could conclude that the cows and bridges are valued more expensively on the Earth than human life. The reasons of revolution For the comparison it is possible to give Lenin's opinion about the reasons for revolutionary situation: Sorokin named two reasons for the revolution: * the suppression of base instincts at the majority of population. * the disorganization of authority and social control. Why does the suppression of base instincts lead to the revolution always? Because it forces man to search the exit from the desperate condition. The hunger weakens the brakes, which retain by man from the theft, eating of low-quality food from the dustbin, robbery and murder. The law-abiding citizen becomes thief and bandit because of the hunger, worker becomes beggar, the believer ceases to be fasted and aristocrat goes to the market to sell the trousers. The complete disappearance of brakes in the behavior of people can lead to the disintegration of the society, when man tears away \\"the framework\\" of civilized behavior completely and this man convert into the beast, which it is permitted all (the murder, violence, robbery). The kinds of the suppressed instincts as the first reason for the revolution Compare the sans-culotte on the left to the culotte-wearer on the right. Both wearing iconic Phrygian caps and tricolor cockades * The hunger, as the suppression of digestive instinct. Hunger preceded all revolutions, especially the hunger on the background of aristocratic gluttony on the feasts. * The increase of poverty, as the suppression of the impulse of property. The proletariat was poor as \\"church rat\\" in Russia. History piled the proletariat to \\"the bed from the nails\\". The revolutionary armies were comprised most frequently from the poor layers, which can not to lose something, but which can acquire all. * The unsuccessful war and state terror, as the suppression of the instinct of self-preservation. Unsuccessful wars precede revolutions. War converts soldiers into the being raged crowds of mad men. Specifically, this had occurred with the Russian soldiers in 1917 and with the German soldiers in 1918. Soldiers throw front and attack the government with the fury. Examples of these revolutions: The Commune of Paris after the Franco-Prussian War, Jaceria in France and uprising Wat Tyler in England after Centenary war, revolution 1905 in Russia after Russo-Japanese War, February revolution 1917 in the end of World War I. Said words can be attributed and to despotic regimes, such regimes are \\"pregnant\\" by revolution because of state terrorism constantly. * The censorship and the prohibition to the human migration, as the suppression of the impulse to have of freedom of press and freedom of movement. * The limitations of estates of the realm, as the suppression of the instinct of self-expression. The limitations of estates of the realm prevented by people from the bottoms from engaging of high socioeconomic status, which corresponds to their talents; therefore the innate ruler, who became simple workers, will become by the leader of secret organization, \\"Cicero\\" will become by propagandists. These are the authentic reasons for revolution, and excuse can be completely different (the quarrel around the religious dogmas or convocation of General States). Ideology determines the selection of the slogans (\\"holy earth\\", \\"true faith\\", \\"republic\\" or \\"socialism\\"). Ideology determines the selection of popular heroes‚ÄîJesus Christ, Jan Hus, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Martin Luther, Karl Marx, Leo Tolstoy or Karl Liebknecht. Ideology determines the selection of basic idea (interpretation of gospel, national idea, the theory of surplus value or capitalist exploitation). Ideology determines the selection of emblem (\\"red Phrygian cap\\" is the identification mark of French revolutionary‚ÄîJacobins, \\"black shirt\\" is form of the Italian fascists of Benito Mussolini, \\"pentagonal red star\\" is sign of membership in the Red Army). What social groups do become revolutionary at first of all and why? Those estates and social groups will be most revolutionary, which have the largest quantity of jammed instincts and, on the contrary, this estates and social groups will be enemies of revolution, which have not jammed instincts completely or which have a small quantity of jammed instincts. Therefore, Bolsheviks could keep on soldiers and workers by the revolutionary ideas easy, and aristocrats were against the revolution always. There were 95% of population on the side of the revolution in February 1917 in Russia, and then some social groups started opposing revolution escalation, these groups wanted that the government brought an order. Even peasants and sailors had risen against the Bolsheviks in Kronstadt In 1921. Soviet government had held the authority under these conditions only cause of the terrible fatigue from the cataclysms of Civil War and cause of concessions in the form of the New Economic Policy. The disorganization of authority and social control as the second reason for revolution The disorganization of authority and social control means the incapacity of government to crush the rebellion, to remove the conditions, which cause the dissatisfaction of population, to cleave the mass on the part and to set them against each other by the principle \\"divide and rule\\", to direct the way out of energy for masses into another no- revolutionary \\"river's bed\\" according to the principle \\"to open the valve so that the boiler would not explode\\". The atmosphere of pre-revolutionary epochs amazes by observer with weakness of the authorities and with degeneration of the elite always. Chronicler Ipuwer wrote about the weakness of authority of pharaohs on the eve of the Egyptian revolution of the epoch of average kingdom: \\"There is no ruler in the country. But where is ruler? Had ruler fallen asleep? Ruler had lost the force and ruler is not support to us\\". The same situation was in Russia in 1917. There was not one sane and imperious minister, ecrepit Ivan Goremykin, incompetent Boris St√ºrmer, mad Alexander Protopopov and mad Vasily Virubov is the entire gallery of mediocre rulers and cynical dwarfs, this is the result of the complete degeneration of elite. History \\"suffers\\" cruel and injurious governments until they are able to operate the state, but history will carry severe verdict to powerless and parasitic governments. The degeneration of elite becomes inevitable, when elite converts into the caste, when social \\"lifts\\" are switched off and way is closed for the innate rulers to upward with help of artificial barriers on the way of circulation into the members of elite. Talented premier-minister Sergei Witte was undergone dislike in side of Nicholas II of Russia repeatedly. When revolutionary explosion occurs, then pitiless revolutionary broom clears out entire social rubbish (aristocrats‚Äîdegenerates). \\"Upstarts\\" from the bottoms rush to upward on the social ladder through the enormous slot in the social sieve of selection. This sieve exists on each floor of social ladder during the normal period of existence of society, when there is no revolution in society. Therefore, new elite builds the new \\"sieve\\" at the second stage of revolution, under protection of which the upstarts, who reached the social top, merge with the remainders of the old aristocracy, which are left for transfer of experience of control over people. New Bolshevik \\"sieve\\" passed to upward only those, who were \\"from the machine tool\\" or \\"from the wooden plough\\", and new Bolshevik \\"sieve\\" rejected to downward all rest people. The second stage of revolution Revolution has two stages. There is a mad energy output at the first stage of revolution, but the person is not the Perpetuum mobile therefore mass apathy and fatigue comes sooner or later. The vigorous group or the tyrant can seize power at the second stage of revolution easily, using this weakness and they can restore an old regime. The second stage is a stage of \\"reaction\\" or \\"restraint\\". Reasons generating this stage, are strengthening of hunger, crime, requisitions, epidemics, \\"wars of all against all\\". People face a dilemma: or to be lost, continuing revolutionary uproar, or to bring an order at any cost. Examples \\"creators of an order\\" are Vladimir Lenin, Maximilien de Robespierre, John Zizka, Oliver Cromwell, Augustus, Napoleon, who are able to bring an order \\"an iron fist\\" after the period of revolutions or reforms. Society which isn't capable to develop with help of peace reforms, is compelled to pay a tribute for revolution at a rate of considerable part of the population. It is possible to draw a conclusion that peace reform is much better, than a social revolution. See also * Social conflict * Social revolution Major works * Sorokin P. A. Sociology of Revolution.

On June 5, 2019, the Federal Communications Commission designated all four EMT stations' licenses for hearing, finding that Romanik had established EMT and provided all the funding to acquire its stations even though he was not a party to any FCC applications. The station's license was cancelled on March 20, 2020.

John Leighton Wilson, missionary to Africa and Secretary of Foreign Missions (1895) by Hampden Coit DuBose. John Leighton Wilson, an alumnus of Columbia Theological Seminary, and his wife Jane Bayard Wilson were the first missionaries to West Africa by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Life Leighton Wilson was born in Sumter, S.C on March 25, 1809. He graduated from Union College, NY in 1829 and Columbia Theological Seminary in 1833. In the fall of 1833 he sailed to West Africa to identify for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (located in Boston) the best location for the Board‚Äôs first mission in West Africa. Cape Palmas, Liberia, was chosen for work among the Grebo people. Returning to the U.S. in 1834, he married Mary Elizabeth Bayard of Savannah, a daughter of a wealthy and aristocratic family. They sailed for Cape Palmas the fall of that year. During the next seven years they established schools for the Grebo, developed a Grebo alphabet, wrote the first Grebo dictionary and grammar, and translated into Grebo not only portions of the Bible but also school book sand hymns. These were printed by their African American missionary colleague B. V. R. James. The Wilsons freed their inherited slaves, provided for their transportation to Cape Palmas and helped them to become established in the African American settler community at the Cape. While at Cape Palmas, Leighton Wilson wrote copious reports about Grebo culture and challenged white stereotypes of Africans. He vigorously opposed the international slave trade and was often quoted in William Lloyd Garrison‚Äôs abolitionist paper The Liberator. Conflict between the African American settlers and the Grebo led the Wilsons to conclude reluctantly that African American colonization in Liberia was, like white colonization in South Africa, an act of imperialism. They came to regret helping their freed slaves come to the Cape, thinking that New England would have been a better place for them to start a new life of freedom. Leighton Wilson began to compare the African American settlers to whites in Georgia who were taking the land of the Cherokees. In 1842, the Wilsons and their colleagues with the American Board turned over their work to a nearby Episcopal mission and moved to Gabon. They had concluded that the conflict between the settlers and the Grebo was too disruptive for the work of the mission. A number of Grebo who had been converted and who had completed their education at the mission school went with them to be teachers in Gabon. A new mission was established at Baraka, near present day Libreville, Gabon, among the Mpongwe people. Schools were quickly established in various towns and villages around the Gabon estuary. An alphabet for the Mpongwe language was soon developed and once again Leighton Wilson wrote a dictionary and grammar of the indigenous language. He translated portions of the New Testament into Mpongwe. When the French began to occupy the estuary, the Wilsons and the other American missionaries supported the Mpongwe in their attempt to resist the imperialism of the French. On one occasion a French naval vessel bombarded the mission at Baraka trying to intimate the missionaries. When American naval ships arrived in the estuary, the French apologized for the bombardment and a serious international incident was avoided. On a visit to the U.S. in 1848, Leighton Wilson took with him a skeleton of a large ape never before seen by whites. Named the gorilla by a Harvard professor, his description of it encouraged a growing scientific racism. Ill health forced the Wilsons to return to the U.S. in 1852. Shortly after he was elected Secretary for the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions located in New York. They purchased a large home in the city and over the next eight years welcomed to it many missionaries and recent converts from various mission fields. In 1856 Wilson‚Äôs book Western Africa was published by Harper and Brothers. A careful and appreciative study of West African cultures and societies, the book still serves as an early resource for anthropologists and historians of West Africa. As the Civil War approached, the Wilsons felt a growing tension. They heard the siren voice of their Southern homeland calling from deep within their memories. They sought to resist its seductions, but the call became more insistent and, finally, irresistible. In spite of their years of fighting slavery, they gave themselves to a history and a people committed to maintaining slavery and its deep oppression‚Äîboth an act of deep love for a place and people, and the desertion of a moral vision. Wilson was soon made the Secretary for Foreign Missions for the newly formed Southern Presbyterian Church. After the Civil War he directed a growing mission movement by Southern Presbyterians. He died in 1885 in the plantation home where he had been born.

After his father's death he made more than one attempt to gain the throne. Youth and first revolt Qais bin Ahmad bin Sa'id Al-Busaidi was the third son of Ahmad bin Said. He has been described as \\"headstrong, ambitious and inclined to give trouble.\\" His father made him governor of Sohar, an important port in the north of Oman. His older brother Said bin Ahmad was elected Imam when his father died in December 1783. The Imam Said became increasingly unpopular. Towards the end of 1785 Qais bin Ahmad declared himself independent. A small number of dissident leaders elected him Imam at Al-Masna'ah, on the Batinah coast. This revolt soon collapsed. Rules of Hamad and Sultan In 1786 the Imam's son Hamad bin Said managed to get control of Muscat, with its fortress. One by one the other fortresses in Oman submitted to Hamad. Said no longer had any temporal power. Hamad took the title of Sheikh and established his court in Muscat. His father, Said bin Ahmad, remained in Rustaq and retained the title of Imam, but this was purely a symbolic religious title that carried no power. Hamad died of smallpox in 1792. On Hamad's death Sultan bin Ahmad took control in Muscat. He was the fifth son of Ahmad bin Sa'id. To avoid family disputes, at a meeting in Barka he confirmed his brother Said as Imam in Rustaq, and he ceded control of Sohar to Qais bin Ahmad. In 1800, Oman suffered from an invasion by Wahhabis from the north, who occupied the Buraimi oasis and besieged Qais bin Ahmad in Sohar. Second revolt The Imam Sultan died in 1804 on an expedition to Basra. He appointed Mohammed bin Nasir bin Mohammed al-Jabry the Regent and guardian of his two young sons, Salim bin Sultan and Said bin Sultan. Qais decided to make another attempt to seize power. Early in 1805 he joined forces with his younger brother Mohammed and marched down the coast to Muttrah, which he took with little opposition. Mohammed bin Nasir tried to buy Qais off with a large monthly annuity. Qais refused since he had growing support and was confident of success, and continued to besiege Muscat. Mohammed bin Nasir called on Badr bin Saif for help. Badr was the son of Saif bin Ahmad, the brother of the former Imam. Badr bin Saif arrived at Muscat just in time to forestall its capitulation. He also arranged for the Wahabbis to attack Sohar. Qais agree to lift the siege in return for being given Al Khaburah and part of the Batinah. A month later he returned and again took Muttrah, but was forced to withdraw when a large seaborne force of Wahabbis appeared. He accepted peace on the grounds that he would gain Muttrah as well as the other places he had taken, and a monthly subsidy. In July he broke his engagement and again advanced on Muscat. The Wahabbis again attacked Sohar, while Said bin Sultan advanced into the Samail valley. Kais was forced to make peace, and gave up Muttrah and his subsidy. Death In May 1808 Qais bin Ahmad was killed at Khor Fakkan in a battle with Shaikh Sultan Al-Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah/Sharjah. He had one son and one daughter. His son Azzan bin Qais inherited the position of governor of Sohar.

He plays for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy and Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. A right-handed opening batsman, Shaw made his first international appearance on 4 October 2018 and became the second-youngest Indian after Sachin Tendulkar to make a Test century and the youngest Indian to do so on Test debut. Shaw made his first- class debut for Mumbai in the semi-finals of the 2016‚Äì17 Ranji Trophy on 1 January 2017. He scored a century in the second innings and was man of the match. Shaw earned another distinction by scoring a century in his debut match of the Duleep Trophy and equalled the record held by Sachin Tendulkar who had scored for the first time a century each in his debut matches of Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy. In December 2017, Shaw was named captain of India's squad for the 2018 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He led India in the final where they beat Australia by 8 wickets to win their fourth Under-19 World Cup. The International Cricket Council (ICC) named Shaw as one of the five breakout stars in men's cricket in 2018. In July 2019, he was suspended by BCCI for doping violation till 15 November 2019. Prithvi Shaw was handed a back-dated 8-month ban for a doping violation on 30 July by the BCCI. Shaw had inadvertently ingested a prohibited substance, which can be commonly found in cough syrups. Shaw's urine sample collected during a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match on 22 February 2019 in Indore was found to contain Terbutaline. Terbutaline, a specified substance, is prohibited both in and out of competition in the WADA Prohibited List of Substances.  Early and personal life  Prithvi Shaw's native place is in Gaya, Bihar. Shaw's father Pankaj Shaw, went off to Mumbai. In 2010, Shaw was offered a contract by AAP Entertainment that allowed him and his father to move to Mumbai and continue his cricketing education. He also received sponsorship from Indian Oil. Shaw was a central figure in the documentary film Beyond All Boundaries and has twice selected to travel to England to further his cricketing education. Shaw has earned a deal worth Rs 36 lakh with SG, which has been endorsed by stalwarts like Sunil Gavaskar, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag in the past.  Domestic career  Shaw played for Middle Income Group (MIG) Cricket Club in Mumbai and was the captain of Rizvi Springfield High School and the Mumbai under-16 team. In November 2013, he had set the highest score by any batsman in any organised form of cricket since 1901 when he hit 546 in a Harris Shield elite division match.https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/18386252/mumbai- teenager-hits-record-546 Shaw captained Rizvi Springfield to two Harris Shield titles in 2012 and 2013, the most prestigious trophy in Indian youth cricket. In 2012, he scored 155 in the semi-final and 174 in the final match. Shaw trains and plays for MIG Cricket Club in Mumbai, where Arjun Tendulkar, son of Sachin, is a teammate.

It was the highest score in Indian schools cricket until the record was surpassed by Pranav Dhanawade on 4 January 2016 and is presently the 4th highest score by any batsman in any form of the organised game. Only AEJ Collins's 628* in 1899 and Charles Eady's 566 in 1901 are higher. Previously the highest score recorded by an Indian in any form of registered competitive cricket was 515 by Dadabhoy Havewala in 1933.

Paolo Foscarini was born in Montalto in Calabria, with the family name Scarini. He studied in Naples at the convent of the Carmine Maggiore and was professor of theology in Messina, where he also taught philosophy. He was appointed prior of the convent of Tropea, vicar provincial of the Order in Naples and from 1608 Father Provincial of Calabria. He died at a Carmelite convent he had founded in Montalto. Works He published a devotional book, \\"Meditations, preces, and Daily Exercises\\", in 1611. In 1613 he published a 7-volume encyclopedia of the liberal arts, physics and metaphysics. But his attempt to publish in 1615 a \\"Letter of opinion over the Pythagorean and Copernican opinion concerning the mobility of the earth and the stability of the sun\\" was more contentious. The letter was addressed to the General of the Carmelites, Sebastiano Fantini. In it he addresses the common scriptural objections to the Copernican system. This reached Galileo when his own \\"Letter to Castelli\\" was being considered by the Inquisition. But Cardinal Bellarmine responded to Foscarini saying that both men should confine themselves to treating the Copernican system as pure hypothesis and that purported reconciliations with the Bible were not allowed. Subsequently the book was banned, unlike the others which were only censored. An English translation by Thomas Salusbury was published in 1661. Epistle concerning the mobility of the earth Foscarini starts by observing: :\\"Because the common system of the world devised by Ptolemy has hitherto satisfied none of the learned, hereupon a suspicion is risen up amongst all, even Ptolemy's followers themselves, that there must be some other system which is more true than this of Ptolemy...The telescope (an optick invention) has been found out, by help of which many remarkable things in the heavens...were discovered...By this same instrument it appears very probable that Venus and Mercury do not move properly about the Earth, but rather about the sun; and that the Moon alone moveth about the earth. :\\"Now can there a better or more commodious hypothesis be devised than this of Copernicus? For this cause many modern authors are induced to approve of, and follow it: but with much hesitancy and fear, in regard that it seemeth in their opinion so to contradict the Holy scriptures, as that it cannot possibly be reconciled to them. Which is the reason that this opinion has been long suppressed and is now entertained by men in a modest manner, and as it were with a veiled face.\\" He identifies 6 classes of statements in the Bible that are taken to oppose the movement of the world: #the Earth stands still, and does not move #the sun moves and rotates about the earth #Heaven is above, and the Earth beneath #Hell is in the Centre of the World #Heaven is always opposed to the Earth #the sun, after the day of Judgment shall stand immoveable in the East, and the Moon in the West (derived from scholastic opinion) He resolves these in turn mainly by the use of metaphor and the common way of speaking.

At first, the carriages used for the through services were provided by the different companies, but in 1860 representatives of the GNR, NER and NBR met to agree the setting up of \\"a common East Coast stock of passenger carriages\\", which was finalised in August‚ÄìSeptember 1860. There were to be fifty carriages, costing a total of ¬£13,450, to be apportioned according to the respective mileages of the companies which operated the London-Edinburgh services: GNR ¬£6,425; NER ¬£5,080; NBR ¬£1,945. The ECJS was set up in 1861 when it comprised 50 coaches; there were 63 in 1865, and 89 in 1873. On 21 May 1872, 36 coaches were allocated to services running between London (King's Cross) and Edinburgh (Waverley); 17 to services between London and Glasgow (Queen Street); and 24 to services between London and Aberdeen. Preservation A number of former ECJS vehicles remain extant on various heritage railways and at the NRM, some being over 100 years old. These include: Dining Car no. 189, built in 1894, withdrawn in 1927 and transferred to departmental use, which is now owned by the London and North Eastern Coach Association (LNERCA) and located at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway; three vehicles from the Royal Train, built in 1908 and which are now part of the National Collection: the two Royal Saloons ‚Äì no. 395 (built for the use of King Edward VII) and no. 396 (for the use of Queen Alexandra and Princess Victoria) ‚Äì both of which had been withdrawn in 1978; and brake van no. 109 (originally no. 82), which had run until 1961.

It was founded in 1891 by Webb C. Ball in Cleveland, Ohio, and is linked to American railroad history. The brand is currently owned by Hong Kong group Asia Commercial Holdings Ltd.  History  BALL advertisement Before the development of railroads across the United States, there was no need for a standardization of time or any real accuracy in timekeeping. Each town kept its own local time, based on the position of the sun. When trains began to connect distant cities, it became problematic and difficult to avoid collisions. Moreover, there were no policies or standards for the watches used by the railroad employees. On April 19, 1891, a head-on collision between two trains in Kipton, Ohio resulted in several deaths. At the time, trains were using the same lines in opposite directions and had to cross each other at defined crossing points. That day, one of the conductors‚Äô watches stopped for four minutes, leading to the fatal collision. In order to make train rides safer for travelers and employees of the railroads, Webb C. Ball was designated ‚ÄúChief Time Inspector‚Äù and set up tests and standards for all watches used on the trains. Ball‚Äôs criteria for accuracy and reliability were so strict that they later inspired others like the Swiss Official Testing Institute (COSC).Jidet, Jo√´l, ¬´ A l‚Äôheure du rail ¬ª, La Revue Des Montres, March 2013Webb C.

He also created the BALL Time Service, an after-sale service to which every employee of the rails had to bring his watch every two weeks to make sure the accuracy and reliability of the watch was maximal. To obtain the ‚ÄúRR Standard‚Äù certification, the watches had to follow certain criteria: * No lid on the dial, size 18 or 16 (44.86mm or 43.17mm) * Plain white dial, bold black hands and Arabic numbers * Winding stem at 12 o‚Äôclock * Minimum of 17 jewels * Must have a double roller * Must be lever-set * Adjusted to at least 5 positions * Be adjusted to temperatures of 40 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit * Accuracy with a gain or loss of maximum 30 seconds a week  Collections  BALL Watch currently has seven distinct collections: Engineer Hydrocarbon, Engineer II, Engineer Master II, Trainmaster, Conductor, Roadmaster and Fireman.

A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient: any invariant morphism uniquely factors through it. Taking Proj (of a graded ring) instead of \\\\operatorname{Spec}, one obtains a projective GIT quotient (which is a quotient of the set of semistable points.) A GIT quotient is a categorical quotient of the locus of semistable points; i.e., \\"the\\" quotient of the semistable locus. Since the categorical quotient is unique, if there is a geometric quotient, then the two notions coincide: for example, one has :G / H = G /\\\\\\\\!/ H = \\\\operatorname{Spec}\\\\\\\\!\\\\big(k[G]^H\\\\big) for an algebraic group G over a field k and closed subgroup H. If X is a complex smooth projective variety and if G is a reductive complex Lie group, then the GIT quotient of X by G is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient of X by a maximal compact subgroup of G (Kempf‚ÄìNess theorem).  Construction of a GIT quotient  Let G be a reductive group acting on a quasi-projective scheme X over a field and L a linearlized ample line bundle on X. Let :R = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\ge 0} \\\\Gamma(X, L^{\\\\otimes n}) be the section ring. By definition, the semistable locus X^{ss} is the complement of the zero set V(R_+^G) in X; in other words, it is the union of all open subsets U_s = \\\\\\\\{ s e 0 \\\\\\\\} for global sections s of (L^{\\\\otimes n})^G, n large. By ampleness, each U_s is affine; say U_s = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A_s) and so we can form the affine GIT quotient :\\\\pi_s\\\\colon U_s \\\\to U_s /\\\\\\\\!/ G = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A_s^G). Note that U_s /\\\\\\\\!/ G is of finite type by Hilbert's theorem on the ring of invariants. By universal property of categorical quotients, these affine quotients glue and result in :\\\\pi\\\\colon X^{ss} \\\\to X /\\\\\\\\!/_L G, which is the GIT quotient of X with respect to L. Note that if X is projective; i.e., it is the Proj of R, then the quotient X /\\\\\\\\!/_L G is given simply as the Proj of the ring of invariants R^G. The most interesting case is when the stable locusNB: In , it was called the set of properly stable points X^s is nonempty; X^s is the open set of semistable points that have finite stabilizers and orbits that are closed in X^{ss}. In such a case, the GIT quotient restricts to :\\\\pi^s\\\\colon X^s \\\\to X^s/\\\\\\\\!/G, which has the property: every fiber is an orbit. That is to say, \\\\pi^s is a genuine quotient (i.e., geometric quotient) and one writes X^s/G = X^s/\\\\\\\\!/G. Because of this, when X^s is nonempty, the GIT quotient \\\\pi is often referred to as a \\"compactification\\" of a geometric quotient of an open subset of X. A difficult and seemingly open question is: which geometric quotient arises in the above GIT fashion? The question is of a great interest since the GIT approach produces an explicit quotient, as opposed to an abstract quotient, which is hard to compute. One known partial answer to this question is the following: let X be a locally factorial algebraic variety (for example, a smooth variety) with an action of G. Suppose there are an open subset U \\\\subset X as well as a geometric quotient \\\\pi\\\\colon U \\\\to U/G such that (1) \\\\pi is an affine morphism and (2) U/G is quasi-projective. Then U \\\\subset X^s(L) for some linearlized line bundle L on X. (An analogous question is to determine which subring is the ring of invariants in some manner.)  Examples  = Finite group action by \\\\Z/2 = A simple example of a GIT quotient is given by the \\\\Z/2-action on \\\\C[x,y] sending : \\\\begin{align} x \\\\mapsto -x && y \\\\mapsto -y \\\\end{align} Notice that the monomials x^2,xy,y^2 generate the ring \\\\C[x,y]^{\\\\Z/2}. Hence we can write the ring of invariants as :\\\\C[x,y]^{\\\\Z/2} = \\\\C[x^2,xy,y^2] = \\\\frac{\\\\C[a,b,c]}{(ac - b^2)} Scheme theoretically, we get the morphism :\\\\mathbb{A}^2 \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\C[a,b,c]}{(ac - b^2)}\\\\right) = \\\\mathbb{A}^2/(\\\\Z/2) which is a singular subvariety with isolated singularity at (0,0,0). This can be checked using the differentials, which are > df = \\\\begin{bmatrix} c & -2b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} hence the only point where the differential and the polynomial f both vanish is at the origin. = Torus action on plane = Consider the torus action of \\\\mathbb{G}_m on X = \\\\mathbb{A}^2 by t\\\\cdot (x,y) = (tx,t^{-1}y). Note this action has a few orbits: the origin (0,0), the punctured axes, \\\\\\\\{(x,0) : x eq 0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{(0,y) : y eq 0\\\\\\\\}, and the affine conics given by xy = a for some a \\\\in \\\\C^*. Then, the GIT quotient X//\\\\mathbb{G}_m has structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\mathbb{A}^2)^{\\\\mathbb{G}_m} which is the subring of polynomials \\\\mathbb{C}[xy], hence it is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{A}^1. This gives the GIT quotient > \\\\pi\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{A}^2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{A}^2//\\\\mathbb{G}_m Notice the inverse image of the point (0) is given by the orbits (0,0), \\\\\\\\{(x,0) : x eq 0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{(0,y) : y eq 0 \\\\\\\\}, showing the GIT quotient isn't necessarily an orbit space.

Lewis was well known for his staunch support of the advancement of a black aesthetic in the arts, particularly the advancement of plays that represented African-Americans well.  Career  Born in Baltimore, Lewis idolized H. L. Mencken, the legendary newspaper writer, magazine editor, and literary critic who contributed to The Smart Set, a magazine that Lewis read religiously. After returning from fighting in World War I, Lewis settled in New York with his family and began working for the Postal Service, a job Lewis held for 33 years and by which supported his wife and three children. There he met Randolph and Owen and showed them one of his reviews of the local theater, and these men loved Lewis caustic take on the oft-demeaning roles that white playwrights gave African- American actors. Randolph offered to buy Lewis‚Äôs theater tickets if Lewis would contribute reviews of theatrical productions to The Messenger; this is the only compensation Lewis received for his work.

History  The Digital Concert Hall was founded at the end of 2008. Wolfram Goertz: Digital Concert Hall - Die digitale Philharmonie (in German), www.rp-online.de, 15 December 2008 (called on 27 February 2012) The Berlin Philharmonic has done pioneering work by establishing this institution. From 2008 to 2016, Deutsche Bank was the main sponsor of the Digital Concert Hall. The institution has been awarded the LeadAward 2009 in gold in the category 'WebTV', the DMMA OnlineStar 2009 in bronze, and numerous other awards. Purpose Around 40 Berlin Philharmonic concerts per year are transmitted by the Digital Concert Hall from the Berlin Philharmonie and can be streamed live in high-definition video and excellent audio quality. In addition, after a few days' post-processing, the concerts can be accessed in the concert archive of the Digital Concert Hall. The comprehensive archive consists of recent concerts, mostly directed by Sir Simon Rattle, but also older performances such as 1990s concerts with Claudio Abbado. Concerts from other venues, for instance the \\"Waldb√ºhne\\" (Berlin's open-air stage), or a series of \\"Europakonzerte\\", are also included. tickets etc.; concert-archive (composers alphabetically ordered; called at 20 Nov. 2013) Moreover, there are documentaries such as the film Rhythm Is It! which deals with a group of Berlin youths and their efforts to realise the ballet Le Sacre du printemps by Stravinky in cooperation with the Berlin Philharmonic, the documentary \\"Trip to Asia\\", contributions from the educational program of the Berlin Philharmonic, plus interviews with conductors or soloists. The documentaries, Education contributions or interviews are usually free of charge, whereas the Philharmonic concerts must be paid for. There are several different ticket options for Digital Concert Hall access: the 7-Day, 30-Day and the 12-Month Ticket. During the given period, the user is entitled to watch as many concerts as he or she wishes. Lastly, there is also a monthly subscription which is automatically extended unless one cancels the arrangement. Tickets are also available as gift vouchers. Since July 2014, the archive of the Digital Concert Hall also contains a collection of archived concerts from the 1960s and early 1970s in which the orchestra is led by Herbert von Karajan, then the chief conductor. One can directly compare different interpretations of certain pieces, which serves to illustrate the changes in conducting over the last decades.  Technology  To capture the moving images during the concerts, seven high- definition video cameras have been installed above the orchestra's stage in the Berlin concert hall. These cameras, as well as the microphones, can be operated by remote control.Die Digital Concert Hall im √úberblick - Die Technik, in German, www.zeit.de (called 27 February 2012) References  External links  *Website of the Digital Concert Hall of the Berlin Philharmonic *Free Concert: Sir Simon Rattle conducts Beethoven's symphonies No. 4 and 7 Berlin Philharmonic German music websites ","title":"Digital Concert Hall"},{"id":"41139389","text":"Magne Landr√∏ (born 24 August 1937) is a retired Norwegian sport shooter.

Design and development The Falco was designed as a glider with performance better than that of a trainer though not at a soaring competition level. It was a high-wing monoplane, with its single spar wing braced on each side by a pair of faired struts arranged in a V, joining the lower fuselage to the outer end of the central panel at about one-third span. This central panel was rectangular in plan and without dihedral. The outer panels were straight- tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal upper surface. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes. Its wood-framed, plywood-skinned fuselage was deep-sided and hexagonal in cross section, tapering markedly towards the tail. The wing was mounted on a pedestal which continued only briefly behind the wing. The pilot's open cockpit was immediately ahead of the pedestal and below the wing leading edge. There was no fixed tailplane; instead the Falco had a single-piece, all-moving elevator with a straight leading edge and a semi-elliptical trailing edge. There was a small triangular fin which supported a much larger, tall balanced rudder, essentially triangular in shape but with rounded vertices. Hinged above the elevator trailing edge, which had a cut-out for its movement, the rudder extended down to the keel, where it was protected by a small, faired tail bumper. There was a long landing skid with rubber shock absorbers, running from near the nose to under the aft end of the wing pedestal. The Falco first flew in 1931. Two were built; one was lost in a crash.

Personal life From 1931, Hermes studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and philosophy at the University of Freiburg. In 1937 he passed the state examination in M√ºnster and was attending there in 1938 when the physicist Adolf Kratzer was present. After that he went on a scholarship to the University of G√∂ttingen and then became an assistant at the University of Bonn. During World War II he was a soldier on the Channel Island of Jersey until 1943 and then on to the Chemical Physics Institute of the Navy in Kiel. At the end of the war he moved to Toplitzsee, where he was tasked with working on new encryption methods. In 1947, he became a lecturer at the University of Bonn where he took his habilitation, his thesis called Analytical manifolds in Riemannian areas. In 1949 he became a Professor at the University of M√ºnster, where he turned back to the subject of mathematical logic. Work Hans Hermes was a pioneer of the Turing machine as the central concept of predictability. In 1937, Hermes reported under the title Definite terms and predictable numbers an article about the Turing machine, which still adheres closely to Turing ideas, but doesn't contain the concepts of the universal machine and the decision problem. In 1952, he published together with Heinrich Scholz, an encyclopedia, which has significantly promoted the development of mathematical logic in Germany. In 1953 he took over management of the influential Institute for Mathematical logic and basic research at the University of M√ºnster, from Heinrich Scholz. Under his leadership, the Institute became a noted centre for attracting young researchers, both within the Federal Republic but also abroad. With Hermes there, among others, were Wilhelm Ackermann and Gisbert Hasenjaeger. In 1966 he accepted an appointment to the newly established Chair of Mathematical Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics at the University of Freiburg and began to build an eponymous department at the Mathematical Institute, becoming Professor Emeritus there in 1977. In 1954 Hermes produced an informal proof, that the possibilities of programmable eigenvalues include the predictable functions , so the calculating machines have the same cardinality as Turing machines re: Turing completeness. Hermes textbook's, as well as his scientific work, persuaded Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus to note the originality, accuracy and intuitive clarity of his textbooks. He was also an outstanding academic teacher who knew how to convey difficult issues and complicated proofs and make them extremely understandable. Hermes was also worked on the compilation and publication of the papers of Gottlob Frege, already begun by Scholz. In 1962 he was one of the founding members of the German Association for mathematical logic and for basic research of the exact sciences (DVMLG). In 1950, he was with Arnold Schmidt and J√ºrgen von Kempski, co-founder of the Archive for Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Mathematics. In 1967, he became a member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences.Record at Heidelberg University library Publications * Definite terms and predictable numbers., Semester reports for the care of the relationship between university and school from the mathematical seminars, M√ºnster 1937, 110‚Äì123. * An axiomatization of general mechanics., Research on logic and the foundations of the exact sciences, Issue 3, Leipzig, 1938. * Machines for decision of mathematical problems., Mathematics and Physical semester reports (G√∂ttingen) (1952), 179‚Äì189. * The universality of program- controlled computing machines., Mathematics and Physical semester reports (G√∂ttingen) 4 (1954), 42‚Äì53. * Introduction to lattice theory.

Officially it is known as the Government House (ŒöœÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒø).  History  The mansion was built during the 1950s as part of the post-war reconstruction of Northern Greece. The project was carried out by the Ministry of Public Works on land donated by the Ministry of National Defence. Upon completion, it was given to the Ministry for Northern Greece to serve as the official residence of the Minister. In 1963, it was transferred to the Greek Royal Family for use as an official royal residence during visits to Macedonia. However, the Royal Family spent only one night in the palace. The family preferred instead to stay at the old M√©diterran√©e Hotel (located directly on the city center's seafront) during their stays in the city. In 1968, following the exile of the Royal Family to Italy due to the military junta, it was returned to the Ministry for Northern Greece. It housed various (but not all) Ministers for Northern Greece (later Ministers for Macedonia- Thrace) from 1968 until 2006. It was here that the incumbent Minister hosted the annual reception for the opening of the Thessaloniki International Fair. In 1997, as part of the events celebrating Thessaloniki as the European Capital of Culture, the mansion hosted a major exhibition of works by Caravaggio. The mansion's most notable visitor was Konstantinos Karamanlis who loyally stayed at the residence during his visits to the area while serving as Prime Minister and later President of Greece. The last Minister to occupy the residence was Nikos Tsiartsionis who criticized the mansion as a sign of opulence which ran counter to his party's platform. In 2006, his successor, Georgios Kalantzis, closed the mansion for renovations which have yet to occur.  Design and features  Main facade The mansion sits on 15 acres overlooking the Thermaic Gulf about 8 km (~5 miles) south of the city center of Thessaloniki. The grounds include a main gate with guard booths, a chapel, a helipad, and access to a dock on the sea. The front facade of the mansion is characterized by a two-level ionic colonnade and a large marble courtyard. A colonnade also runs across the rear facade of the mansion. This created ample outdoor space which facilitated the hosting of large open-air events. The mansion itself consists of two principal floors covering 1,200 square meters (13,000 square feet). The public reception rooms are located on the ground floor; the upper floor consists of two suites and staff areas. The basement holds the kitchens, laundry, storage, and utility rooms.  Current condition and use  A summer concert in the courtyard Today, the property is guarded and the grounds are maintained but the building has no specific purpose and is in need of extensive renovation. The grounds and the courtyard are used periodically for concerts, gallery exhibitions or expositions which take advantage of the building as an architectural backdrop, and its impressive seafront location. Use of the property is shared between the Ministry of Macedonia and Thrace (the legal owner) and the municipality of Kalamaria. When the mansion was closed in 2006, the Thessaloniki Prefecture estimated that ‚Ç¨3,800,000 was needed solely to upgrade the mansion's critical systems (electric, hydraulic, plumbing etc). Since then, due to the permeation of moisture into the mansion, most of the building's contents including all of the paintings, carpets, artwork and objects d'art have been moved to warehouses or have been loaned to museums. The basic furnishing have been wrapped in plastic and stacked in their respective rooms. No renovation/restoration work has begun.

He was an art teacher in Fife schools and taught pupils at Bell Baxter High School in Cupar between 1969 and 1979. Will Maclean spent another period of time at sea in 1968 as a ring-net fisherman, which led to the Scottish International Education Trust Award bursary in 1973 to study ring-net herring fishing. The resulting Ring-Net Project, a body of over 400 drawings, was exhibited at the Third Eye Centre, Glasgow, from where it toured, and in 1986 at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, where it entered the permanent collection. In 1981 he was appointed lecturer at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, University of Dundee, where he remained for fifteen fruitful years, becoming Professor of Fine Art in 1994 and in 2004-2006, senior research fellow and now emeritus professor. He was elected Royal Scottish Academician in 1991 and in 1997 he designed and as part of the team, won the Scottish Natural Heritage Supreme Award for three Memorial Cairns in Lewis. In 1999 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of St Andrews and Civic Trust Award, winning the Scottish Arts Council Creative Scotland Award in the same year. The British Library and Tate Artists Lives Sound Archive made a valuable recorded interview with him in 2005, the year he was awarded an MBE for services to Education and the Arts. He lives and works in Tayport, Fife with his wife, the artist Marian Leven. In 2008 he was made an honorary fellow of the University of the Highlands and in 2009 he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Aberdeen.

Rhys was born in Llwydcoed and from an early age showed an interest in public affairs. In 1847, he lost his sight after an accident at Dowlais works where he was conducting experiments with \\"gun cotton\\". Public life Following his accident, Rhys devoted much of his time and energy to public life and became a highly respected figure in the Aberdare Valley, even among those of opposing political views. He was involved with a number of public improvements in Aberdare, including the development of Aberdare Park, for which he donated the land. In 1846 he became one of the three members representing Aberdare on the Merthyr Tydfil Board of Guardians in the 1840s and was chairman from 1880 to 1887. For many years he chaired the Assessment Committee, and was also involved in the industrial schools movement. In 1884 the Guardians unveiled a marble bust of Rhys, prepared by Thomas Brock, which was placed in the committee room. Rhys was best known in local government as a member of the Aberdare Local Board of Health from its formation in 1854, serving as its chairman from the 1860s until its abolition. As a member of the Local Board, Rhys was instrumental in securing land from the Charity Commissioners where the Aberdare Public Park was developed, and also land for the municipal cemetery. He was also prominent in the development of the water and sewerage schemes for Aberdare. He also served as a member and chairman of the Aberdare Burial Board. Similarly, he was a member of the Aberdare School Board from 1874 and served as its chairman from 1877 until 1898. As an educationalist his activities ranged from advocating industrial schools to take children out of the workhouse to his membership of the Governors of the University College Cardiff. Rhys was made a county magistrate for Glamorgan in 1867 and at the time of his death he was the longest serving member of the bench. In 1889 he became an inaugural member of Glamorgan County Council, after a close contest with Griffith George, a prominent Liberal in Aberdare. During that contest, Rhys received the public support of Lord Aberdare. This, in turn, led to an attack on Rhys's record as a magistrate and guardian of the poor in the columns of the radical journal, Baner ac Amserau Cymru. He remained a member of the county council until his death. In 1894 he became an inaugural member and first chairman of the Aberdare Urban District Council. In 1898, in recognition of his long public service, and to mark the onset of his eightieth year, Rhys was presented with a testimonial and a gift of a thousand guineas. At the time of his death Rhys was described as a moderate liberal who took little interest in national politics and concentrated on his work on local public bodies. In reality, however, he inclined towards the Conservative Party and supported William Thomas Lewis as Conservative candidate for Merthyr Boroughs at the 1880 General Election, having led the deputation to request him to contest the seat against Henry Richard and C.H. James. Rhys was a Unitarian by upbringing, which reflected his family connections with Hen-Dy- Cwrdd, at Llwydcoed. He did, however, grow distant from these connections in his later years. Rhys died in 1899, aged 81. He was buried in the family grave at Penderyn.

Most of the district's growth dates from the 1920s. The architecture reflects several trends in the first half of the 20th century. History Glen Ellyn, Illinois was first settled in the 1830s. Early commercial developments, such as Stacy's Tavern, catered to stagecoach lines. The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened a station in the undeveloped area in 1849. The Downtown North district began to develop on the north side of the tracks at this time. The earliest non-residential construction south of the tracks began in 1859 with the opening of the Duane Street School. In 1891, the settlement changed its name to Glen Ellyn in response to the development of the Glen Ellyn Hotel & Springs Company resort at a nearby lake. The resort improved the town's reputation as an idyllic suburb and encouraged growth.http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000717.pdf In the early 20th century, Glen Ellyn expanded quickly and began to expand its commercial district to the south side of the tracks. The Methodist Episcopal Church was completed at the corner of Duane Street and Forest Avenue in 1913; it was replaced in 1957. The first commercial building in the district was completed in 1923 for I. M. Block. In 1928, Piggly Wiggly opened a store at the corner of Main Street and Hillside Avenue in the Rohm Building. The largest development was the three-story Glen Ellyn Junior High School, which replaced the Duane Street School in 1929. Architecture There are twenty buildings in the district, and all but one contribute to its historical integrity.

On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of volunteer projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world. Though based within the UK's Jewish Community, Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week, and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well. 'Mitzvah' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or 'commandment', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary English. The 2020 date is Sunday November 15.  History  Mitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in Los Angeles, decided to bring Day' concept she became familiar with through the Temple Israel of Hollywood synagogue back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or congregation, her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country. Mitzvah Day was originally associated with the Jewish Community Centre for London, and became registered as an independent charity in the United Kingdom in 2008.  Endorsements  Mitzvah Day has been publicly endorsed by many public figures in the United Kingdom, including former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg, Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom Jonathan Sacks, and The Archbishop of Canterbury. It won a Prime Minister's Big Society Award in 2011  International expansion  Headquartered in London, UK, the event has since spread to include participation from many international partners, primarily in Europe, North America, Israel, Australia, Brazil, and Southern Africa. In 2012, the name of the organization officially changed from 'Mitzvah Day' to 'Mitzvah Day International' to reflect the growing participation of community groups outside the UK.

Sir Thomas Vyner, 1st Baronet (1588‚Äì1665) was a wealthy English businessman and politician who served as the Lord Mayor of London. Vyner supplied gold bullion to two English kings and to the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. Born at North Cerney, Gloucestershire, on 15 Dec. 1588, Vyner was the son of Thomas and Anne Vyner. After his father's death in 1600, Vyner was sent to London to live with his sister and brother- in-law, Samuel Moore. Samuel Moore introduced Vyner to the goldsmithing trade. Vyner soon became a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and later became its prime warden. In 1622, Vyner purchased a mansion in what was then the village of Hackney near London. On 8 July 1624, James I appointed Vyner to the office of comptroller of the mint. Under the regime of Oliver Cromwell, Vyner supplied large quantities of gold bullion to and created coinage for both the English government and the East India Company. In 1656, he and a partner purchased a large quantity of Spanish bullion to be converted into coins. As Vyner became more successful in business, he started venturing into politics. In 1646, he was elected alderman of the Billingsgate ward of London, a post he would hold until 1651. In 1648, he was elected sheriff. In 1651, Vyner ran for election as alderman in the Langbourn ward. In 1653, he became the Lord Mayor of London. That same year, Vyner was knighted by Cromwell. In 1660, with the loss of his post as alderman, Vyner appears to have retired from public service. On 18 June 1661 Charles II made Vyner a baronet. Vyner died in Hackney on 11 May 1665. He was buried in St Mary Woolnoth church in Langbourn, although his monuunment was moved by his great nephew Robert Vyner to Gautby. Vyner had three wives, four daughters, and two sons. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son George. George remained living in Hackney until his death in 1673. George's son and heir, Thomas, was baptised at St John's church, Hackney, in 1664.

The Kerry Committee report indicated Brenneke did not have the CIA connections he claimed to possess.https://apnews.com/26207f1adffd774dbedd323aeeb79095 The Task Force's report stated that Brenneke \\"played a central role in falsely propagating the October Surprise allegations for financial and person reasons\\". Early life Brenneke was the oldest of Richard W. and M. Patricia Brenneke four sons. He graduated from Jesuit High School in Beaverton, Oregon in 1960, then earned a B.A. degree from Seattle University in 1964 and a M.A. degree from University of Toronto in 1968. Career In December 1986 Brenneke was listed by the Philadelphia Inquirer as one of 16 of a \\"cast of characters\\" involved in the Iran-Contra affair, describing him as \\"An Oregon real estate developer with extensive contacts in Iran. Says he was involved, with the CIA and NSA, in an attempt to sell 39 F-4E fighter planes to Iran in 1985. Says he met with several Iranian officials.\\"Philadelphia Inquirer, 7 December 1986, The Iran- contra Arms Deal: A Cast Of Characters \\"Called before a Senate subcommittee on narcotics and international relations in 1988, Brenneke claimed to have run drugs from Colombia to the U.S. as part of a Contra supply operation. He also testified to having purchased arms in Czechoslovakia for the Nicaraguan rebels. That testimony was called slanderous by then-Vice President Bush, and a 1989 Senate committee report concluded that Brenneke never had the Central Intelligence Agency connections he claimed.\\"David Johnston, New York Times, 11 June 1988, Senate Panel's Top Republican Says Chairman Politicized Drug Inquiry =Rupp trial (1988)= On 23 September 1988, Brenneke voluntarily testified at the sentencing hearing of Heinrich Rupp, a \\"close friend\\" who had been convicted of bank fraud. Brenneke testified that Rupp believed he was acting on behalf of the CIA in carrying out the fraud, which Brenneke said was part of a much wider CIA scheme to gain funding for covert operations by defrauding savings and loan associations. Brenneke cited Indian Springs State Bank as an example - the bank had loaned money to Global International Airways, a company involved in the Iran-Contra affair, and the Iranian Farhad Azima had been a major shareholder of the bank and also owner of the airline. A 1975 ID card Brenneke supplied to a Houston Post reporter showed Rupp as a pilot for the airline. Brenneke said that he and Rupp had been involved in various covert operations for the agency in the past. He said he and Rupp and been involved in such matters since Brenneke's days at the CIA's Air America, beginning in 1967.New York Times, 6 June 1990, Man Cleared of Lying in Remarks On Reagan Aides and 52 Hostages As an example of the kind of covert operations he and Rupp had been involved in, Brenneke said that he and Rupp had been involved in some of the meetings at which the 1980 October Surprise affair was arranged. Brenneke said that on the night of 18 October 1980, Rupp had flown William Casey from Washington's National Airport to Paris' Le Bourget Airfield for a series of secret meetings. These meetings (on 19 and 20 October) involved negotiations between Iranian representatives and members of the Reagan-Bush campaign. Brenneke testified he was present at the last of three meetings, on the details of the cash and weapons involved, at which Casey and Donald Gregg were also present. Brenneke also testified that George H.W. Bush was present in Paris for the meetings, but a month after his deposition he amended his statement by letter to the judge, clarifying that his knowledge of Bush's presence was not first-hand but came from Rupp. =Perjury trial (1989 - 1990)= For his role in the Rupp trial, Brenneke was charged with five counts of making false declarations to a federal judge, a charge slightly stronger than perjury.Marilynn Wheeler, Associated Press, 6 May 1990, Jury Foreman Says He Never Doubted Brenneke's Innocence He was indicted on 12 May 1989, accused of lying about his and Rupp's CIA connections and about the October Surprise meetings. The timing caused some speculation that the charges were intended to avoid political embarrassment for Donald Gregg, whose Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as Ambassador to South Korea began the same day: the charges prevented senators from raising accusations Brenneke had made in 1988 that Gregg had directed the Iran-Contra affair out of the Vice-President's office.Lee May, Los Angeles Times, 13 May 1989, Panel Probes Ex-Bush Aide on Contra Supply Scheme The prosecution offered Brenneke a deal that would keep him out of prison if he pleaded guilty; he refused. The prosecution produced a CIA personnel specialist who testified that he could not find Brenneke or Rupp in the Agency's employment records, but under cross- examination admitted that Rupp had been trained by the CIA's Intermountain Aviation, and that the Agency had \\"files\\" on both Rupp and Brenneke. Frank Snepp testified that CIA contract agents were often not listed in employment records where the agents were involved in sensitive operations. Two intelligence operatives from Texas testified to collaborating with Brenneke. Donald Gregg testified that on 18 October 1980 he was not in Paris but on holiday in Delaware, providing in evidence family photographs he said were taken that weekend. A meteorologist testified that the sunny weather conditions made it highly unlikely that they had been taken that weekend in that location. The prosecution failed to prove that Casey and Bush could not have attended the Paris meetings. Defense witnesses included William Northrop indicted in the Brokers of Death arms case, which had been dropped in January 1989 on the grounds that the prosecution could not disprove the defendants' claims that they believed the planned arms shipments to Iran were or could be government-sanctioned. Northrop testified that Israeli arms shipments to Iran began \\"within a fortnight\\" of the Paris meeting. On 4 May 1990, after only five hours of deliberation, the jury found Brenneke \\"not guilty\\" on all five counts. Following the trial, jury foreman Mark Kristoff stated, \\"We were convinced that, yes, there was a meeting, and he was there and the other people listed in the indictment were there.... There never was a guilty vote.... It was 100 percent.\\" =Claims on RAI Television= In July 1990, provided documents to Italian journalists regarding Licio Gelli and Propaganda Due (P2), asserting CIA support for their activities.La Repubblica, 4 July 1990, GELLI E L' AGENTE DELLA CIA LA PAROLA E' AI MAGISTRATI Calling the allegations \\"absolute nonsense\\", the CIA denied involvement in Italian terrorism and the assassination of Olof Palme. Given \\"the outrageous nature of his claims\\", the CIA gave a public denial stating: \\"The agency flatly denies that Mr. Brenneke was ever an agent of the CIA or had any association with the CIA.\\" =Brenneke's records= In 1991, Peggy Adler was retained by Brenneke to co-author his autobiography. Discovering evidence in his files contradicting some of his claims regarding his presence at October Surprise conspiracy meetings, she contacted former CIA agent-turned-journalist, Frank Snepp. Snepp included this evidence (of credit card receipts showing a presence in Portland when Brenneke said he was in Paris) in a February 1992 article he wrote for the Village Voice. Adler's work was the subject of a chapter in Robert Parry's book, \\"Trick or Treason: The October Surprise Mystery\\" and she was interviewed by PBS' Frontline in this regard, aired in April 1992. In mid-1992, learning that the House October Surprise Task Force was investigating whether or not there actually had been an October Surprise, she contacted investigative journalist and author Steven Emerson, who put her in touch with the Task Force so that she could turn over to them the seventy cartons of documents she'd hauled east from Brenneke's home in Portland, Oregon, in order to write his memoirs. In the month of June Adler worked as a consultant to the Task Force.Peggy Adler employed as an Assistant Investigator by the U.S. House of Representatives' October Surprise Task Force (pdf) Death In 2015, Brenneke passed away from complications due to heart disease and diabetes.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History In 1855, Charles Mears constructed a channel from Pentwater Lake to Lake Michigan, lined with timber cribbing, to accommodate his lumbering interests. In 1858, he built a pier extending over into Lake Michigan where ships could dock. Additional pier structures were built to line the channel. The first incarnation of the channel was relatively shallow, but Mears continued to improve it, and by 1865 it was deep enough that a lake-going steamer, the Daylite, was able to sail into Pentwater Lake. In 1868 the US government began widening and improving Mears's channel. The channel was widened to and dredged to a depth of . Two piers were constructed, and in 1873 a timber-framed lighthouse, high, was built on the south pier. A red 6th-order Fresnel lens was installed. A life-saving station was constructed on the north pier in 1887, and in 1917 the pierhead light was automated. In 1937, the entire pier structure was replaced by the Army Corps of Engineers with a concrete pier. At the same time, the timber-framed lighthouse was replaced with a steel skeleton structure, and the optic replaced with a lens. Most of the life-saving station site, with the exception of the flag tower, was demolished in 1958. A second light was erected on the north pier in 1997.

He was born in Shooter's Hill (London), England and died 16 March 1812 in Blackheath (London). He rose to the rank of Lieutenant- general in the Royal Artillery. He studied drawing and recorded military operations in water-colours during several military campaigns in North America. He later became a noted artist and naturalist. He was the first to illustrate and describe the superb lyrebird. His work was not well known until after a 1953 auction from the Earl of Derby's library. His paintings were later shown as part of a major exhibition, 2 July ‚Äì 4 September 1972, at the National Gallery of Canada. Early life Very little is known of his early life. In his will, he lists his father as David Davies from Shooter's Hill. Military service Davies began military service at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1755. There he received training in topographic drawing to provide detailed and accurate drawings for military use. By 1757 he became second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery and began service abroad in Canada. =French and Indian War= His earliest work is a drawing of Halifax during the failed Louisbourg expedition in 1757. The next year, he recorded the military operations during the Siege of Louisbourg, including the Expulsion of the Acadians. Starting in 1759, he was with General Jeffery Amherst's forces, first at the Fort Ticonderoga and then at Fort Crown Point. In 1760, he fought in the attack against Montreal and commanded a boat in a naval battle, which he also illustrated. After the attack against Montreal, he surveyed the regions surrounding Lake Ontario for several years, producing both military maps and artistic landscapes. He painted a series of waterfalls, including views of Great Seneca Falls and Niagara Falls. His 1762 watercolour of Niagara Falls, An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara, was the first eyewitness painting and the first accurate view of the falls. =American Revolutionary War= In 1776, Davies returned to North America with General William Howe during the American War for Independence. After the Battle of Long Island in August, he illustrated the British fleet in the harbour. Later that year, he continued with General Howe at the Battle of White Plains and the subsequent Battle of Fort Washington, where he illustrated the battle scene. Under the command of General Charles Cornwallis at the Battle of Fort Lee, Davies captured the landing at and ascent of the Palisades by the British forces. This work has sometimes been attributed to Lord Francis Rawdon, since he later bought it from Davies. In 1777, he was sent to command Fort Knyphausen, previously known as Fort Washington. In 1780, he returned to England.

Hon. Lieut. Gen. Earl Cornwallis =Royal Artillery command= After the war, he received several promotions and was assigned to command posts in Gibraltar, the West Indies, and Canada. In 1799, he was appointed colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery. His last promotion was to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1803. Artist and naturalist Menura superba (superb lyrebird) by Thomas Davies In 1781, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a fellow of the Linnean Society of London and contributed several articles, especially regarding ornithology in Australia. In 1800, he was the first to illustrate and describe the superb lyrebird, in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. He also read reports to the society on the southern emu-wren of Australia and the meadow jumping mouse of Canada. Style Davies' style combines the precision of military artists with the skills of naturalists. His works have been compared to those of Henri Rousseau, George Edwards, and Paul Sandby.

Encampment of pastoralists from Mohammad Khanlu tribe in Chaparli. The aggressive shepherd dogs of Arasbaran are resting in Chapali. Chaparli (⁄ÜŸæÿ±ŸÑ€å) is a grassland on a mountain range between Abbasabad and Oskolou villages.http://www.sid.ir/Fa/VEWSSID/J_pdf/50313893801.pdf The area is the summer quarter of the Derilou branch of Mohammad Khanlu tribe, which in the wake of White Revolution included 40 households.P. Oberling, ‚ÄúThe Tribes of QarƒÅca DƒÅƒ°,‚Äù Oriens 17, 1964, p. 69 The number significantly dropped over years and in late 1990s no family migrated to the summer quarter of Chaparli for the lack of experienced shepherds. The trend has somehow reversed in recent years, and about 20 families pitch their tents in the area, albeit mainly for escaping the unpleasantly hot climate of Derilou village. Chaparli is a prime location for observing, even experiencing, the idyllic life of Arasbaran nomadic tribes. Moreover, the topography provides an excellent sightseeing opportunity. In addition to green mountain ranges, many scenic villages of Kaleybar County and Khoda Afarin County are in full view. In Chaparli Arasbaran dogs receive due respect Orhan Pamuk in 2001 Turkish novel, My Name Is Red,Orhan Pamuk,My Name Is Red, 2006, Random House LLC., Chap. 3 gives a vivid description of Turkic people's love-hate attitude towards dogs. Every summer, the real life version of this description is in display in Chaparli. Each family has 2-5 dogs, all with characteristic cropped ears and tails. The dogs are fed generous portions of milk soaked breads. When the sheep herds are brought back for milking near tents, dogs sleep around the camp most of the day. The inhabitants treat the beasts with utter respect, a manner which is loathed by more pious villagers of the region as a pagan act. Between dusk and down dogs regain their vicious character; strangers have to avoid crossing campsite otherwise the attacking dogs cannot be controlled even by their owners. Fending off the dogs by beating is considered an act of aggression towards the owner and should be avoided. In fact most of the feuds between settled villagers and pastoralists is about dogs.

Retour √† Whitechapel has been nominated for the 2013 Historia Book Award (Historical crime novel).http://www.livreshebdo.fr/prix-litteraires/tous-les-prix/prix- historia-du-roman-policier-historique Background While working as an associate professor of Sociology at Montpellier University, Michel Moatti encountered the works of British sociologist Charles Booth, which covered the districts of the East End (and included detailed poverty maps). Moatti used Booth's work to describe the daily life of the inhabitants of Whitechapel during the time period of crimes attributed to Jack the Ripper. Plot In 1941, the Germans are bombing London. Amelia Pritlowe is a nurse working at the London Hospital, located in the Whitechapel district. After the death of her father, Mrs. Pritlowe receives a letter from him, stating that she is in fact the daughter of Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's fifth and final murder victim, killed in 1888. Pritlowe develops an obsession with finding her mother's murderer and avenging her death. She becomes a member of a club whose focus is the history of Jack the Ripper. The Filebox Society is located in Spitalfields, the London community where the murder of Amelia's mother occurred. Pritlowe pores over the archives looking for clues. She reads the testimony of various people who saw Mary Jane Kelly on the last day of her life. One living witness, Maria Harvey, her mother's best friend, reveals that she actually cared for Amelia, who was then a child, on the night of November 8, 1888-the eve of her mother's death. Harvey also tells Pritlowe that she spent the night of November 8 at the home of Elizabeth Prater, Mary Jane Kelly's upstairs neighbor. Puzzled, Pritlowe confides in a member of the Society who had claimed that she could awaken her memories of that night by hypnosis sessions http://www.lesechos.fr/05/02/2013/LesEchos/21369-048-ECH_comment-jack-l- eventreur-a-tue-ma-mere.htm Pritlowe agrees to be hypnotized, and after a few sessions discovers that she had heard the name of the assassin because she was awake at the time Mary Kelly died. Amelia also discovers that the killer had worked with an accomplice. According to the archives of the Filebox Society, Amelia learns that the killer has been dead for seven years, but the accomplice is still alive. She is determined to find and confront him. Narrative structure Back to Whitechapel is based on Amelia Pritlowe‚Äôs diary,http://smallthings.fr/livre/retour-a-whitechapel-michel-moatti/ and alternates between chapters recounting the last weeks of Mary Jane Kelly in Spitalfields and other chapters where witnesses testify at the inquest. Critical reaction Premiere, Black Novel http://black-novel.over- blog.com/article-retour-a-whitechapel-de-michel-moatti-hc- editions-116050284.html and 20 Minutes praised its realism and Moatti's ability to conjure up the atmosphere of 19th century Whitechapel,http://www.20minutes.fr/montpellier/1104975-donne-visage-jack- eventreur which Premiere compared to the writings of Peter Ackroyd.

He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1913. The following year he became part of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation, whose task was the eradication of certain diseases of particular social importance in different parts of the world. From 1914 to 1924 he worked in Central America. In 1924 he was transferred to Italy. Hackett had the opportunity to collaborate with the Italian doctor Alberto Missiroli, at the Laboratory of Public Health of Rome, who was interested in the implementation of preventive measures for malaria control based on the control of mosquitoes. Together with Bartholomew Gosio, he founded the School of Malariology in Nettuno. He began to experiment with DDT against Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of the disease. In 1925, Hackett and Missiroli, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, started the work which led to the creation of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†. In 1940, with the outbreak of World War II, Hackett left Italy to go to South America where he remained until 1949. Overall, Hackett worked in seventeen countries. He was the first editor of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene when it was created in 1952 and president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) in 1959.

He wrote that the premise can push its dramatic moments a little too far and almost nothing happens throughout the first half of the series. Regardless, Kimlinger praised the plot's character development, saying that it saves the first half with its progression through little events; he added that the dramatic scenes are nicely underplayed to help viewers care for the characters. Kimlinger wrote that Brain's Base and director Tarou Iwasaki provide the series with a style that's perfect, calling the minimalist backgrounds evocative with the right mood and the character animations superb, saying \\"that makes the show what it is: a sleeper delight, plain and simple.\\" The manga has had over 1 million copies printed in Japan.

Mercury feed In 1969 in Alamogordo, New Mexico, Ernest Huckleby purchased grain from the Golden West Seed Company to feed his hogs.David Brinkley reported the Huckleby's story on the NBC Evening News on Tuesday, February 17, 1970. A more general story appeared on First Tuesday, October 6, 1970, in which the panelists discussed \\"the perfect pesticide.\\" As part of his purchase he was also given some \\"waste\\" grain which included some seeds, dyed pink in warning, which had been treated with a mercuric fungicide. Unaware of the danger, Huckleby fed the mercury treated seed grain to a hog which he later slaughtered and fed to his wife, who was 3 months pregnant, and to his 8 children. Several of Huckleby's hogs had appeared to be ill, and he believed that they were suffering from what farmers called the \\"blind staggers,\\" but the hog he fed to his family had appeared unaffected.Mercury Poison Peril Continues. The Palm Beach Post, Aug 13, 1970. Within 3 months the children had developed \\"ataxia, agitation, visual impairment, and impaired consciousness.\\" When born, baby Michael was severely neurologically impaired, blind, subject to convulsive seizures, and only minimally aware of his environment. Ernestine, 8 years old, became blind, unable to sit unsupported or to roll over, unable to hold objects, incontinent and unable to speak. Amos, 13 years old, became functionally blind, with sensory degradation and impaired coordination. Dorothy Jean Huckleby, 20 years old, suffered from tunnel vision, slurred speech, impaired coordination and numbness and tingling in her extremities. Mr. and Mrs. Huckleby were unaffected, which corresponds well with current medical findings that methylmercury is more dangerous to the developing nervous system of infants and children, but, for reasons the doctors did not understand, 4 of the Huckleby's 8 children‚Äîall of whom shared the meal‚Äîwere unaffected. Of the 4 that were affected, Dorothy Jean and Amos were hospitalized in a rehabilitation center in Roswell, New Mexico for 18 months. When placed in the facility, Dorothy had not been able to stand or use her arms or legs, she had no control over her bowels and bladder, and was unable to speak. After 18 months in the facility she had regained most of her function, a recovery her doctors and the press lauded as \\"miraculous.\\" At release, Amos was blind, confined to a wheelchair, and could speak only with difficulty. Baby Michael was born blind and seriously mentally and physically impaired, and remained so. Ernestine was placed in Gerald Champion Memorial Hospital in Alamogardo, where she remained in a coma for more than a year. When she emerged from the coma, she was blind, with severe physical disability, and it was reported that \\"She may never understand what has happened to her.\\"Mercury poisoning victim makes miraculous recovery The Miami News, Jun 9, 1971.

The iconic photograph of Ernestine, a young black girl with large staring eyes clutching her teddy bear, broke the heart of a nation. Foreword by Gilbert M. Grosvenor. The photographer, James P.

Systematic production ended in 1941, but the factory was able to continue assembling cars from existing inventory of parts and components until 1943. In total, 62,888 GAZ M1 automobiles were produced. Much of the car‚Äôs production period coincided with the Great Patriotic War (World War II), and many, as they were commonly called, Emkas were used by the army as staff cars. Various special versions were produced such as the Gaz M - FAI and BA-20 armoured car models The car has subsequently become an icon of its time in Russia, having been relatively popular, and featuring in film and photographic images of a defining period in the history of the Soviet Union. Background The Soviet Union‚Äôs first passenger car had been the GAZ-A, produced between 1932 and 1936, and based on the Ford Model A (1927‚Äì31), built under license/technology sharing agreement with and using parts purchased from the American Ford Motor Company. It would be many years before passenger cars became available for private buyers in the Soviet Union, and passenger cars at this stage were produced for official and military use. By the time the GAZ-A was being produced in the Soviet Union, the western original Ford Model A was already becoming superseded in its western markets, and the politicians and Red army looked for a way to reduce dependence on imported components and replacement parts. The version of the Ford adapted for Soviet production was an open topped car which was unsuitable for the winter climate encountered in most of the country, and the cars were felt to be unreliable and insufficiently robust for the relatively harsh Russian conditions. There had therefore been various attempts to modify the GAZ-A using locally designed elements, but the body structures in question had used traditional timber frames with panels attached, which were labour-intensive to produce and excessively prone to deform. In the US car body construction was changing radically during the later 1920s, using technology pioneered by Budd Company, for the production of all steel car bodies. The new approach used far more complicated steel pressings than had hitherto been possible, and the same new techniques were adopted by the more prosperous of the volume auto-makers in the west of Europe through the 1930s. GAZ‚Äôs western technology partner, Ford, took a conservative approach to these developments, but during the early 1930s they, too, would join in the switch to all-steel car bodies. The Soviet Union was keen for the same technology to be applied at the GAZ plant in Gorky, exploiting the ten-year technology sharing agreement which had been signed with the Ford Motor Company in 1932, and which at this stage remained more or less intact. Development and introduction  Work began in 1933/34 on a replacement for the GAZ-A, again using a (newer) Ford model as the basis. The model in question was the Ford Model B, which was becoming available with a wide range of different bodies in North America. Rear view of the GAZ M-415, a light truck version of the M1 Specifically, the first prototype for the GAZ M-1 was based on the 1934 Ford Model B 40A four-door sedan. The prototype was powered by a four-cylinder engine, although it appears already to have been intended that production cars, like the Ford on which they were based, would use V8 units. Documentation was transferred by Ford in accordance with the terms of the technology sharing agreement and the first prototype was unveiled in February 1935. A major innovation for the manufacturer was the all-steel body, although at this stage the roof was still reinforced using timber side rails and was coated with synthetic ‚Äúleatherette‚Äù fabric. In 1936 the M-1 replaced the GAZ-A on the manufacturer‚Äôs production lines, with the first two cars produced in March of that year and volume production starting in May. By the end of 1936 the plant had produced 2,524 GAZ M-1s, and in 1937 an M-1 was displayed in Paris at the International Artistic and technical exhibition of modern life. The letter ‚ÄùM‚Äù was included in the car‚Äôs name as the plant's name included that of Vyacheslav Molotov.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. This 15 rouble \\"special issue\\" postage stamp of 2012 reflects the car's enduring iconic status in Russia. Local modifications The development of the M-1 involved many changes to the Ford on which it was based, so that many came to view the Russian car as a separate model. The rather primitive Ford suspension was completely redesigned to cope with local conditions, and matched to strong steel wheels. The V8 engine was based on the same technical drawings as those used for the Ford engine, but Ford has sent only drawings. The GAZ development team had not had access to the actual Ford engine as fitted in Detroit, and so any necessary interpretations of the technical drawings were their own. The GAZ engineers also redesigned the front wings which left the Russian car with a more elegant shape which provided better protection from the elements for the front suspension. =The body= The M-1 represented a huge advance over its predecessor in many respects. Most obviously, it came with a body that used the ‚Äúall-steel‚Äù approach of the more modern western designs (despite retaining timber structural elements in the roof frame) and, unlike its predecessor, a permanent fixed roof. The chassis featured an ‚ÄúX‚Äù shaped cross member making it far stronger. The suspension was more modern and the road holding more sure-footed. Under the bonnet/hood the car came with automatic ignition, while the cabin featured front seats that could be adjusted, sun-visors, along with an electric fuel gauge, and windows which could be swiveled into an open position. =The engine and transmission= The engine was more powerful and more durable. Maximum output rose from to , supported by a compression ratio increased to 4.6:1 and a new carburetor design. The new engine came with a fuel pump whereas its predecessor had depended on a gravity driven fuel-feed system. The same engine was subsequently installed in the GAZ‚ÄìMM light truck, an upgrade of the GAZ- AA. The three speed manual transmission now featured synchromesh in the upper two ratios, and was the gear box that would be carried forward to the replacement GAZ Pobeda in the later 1940s. Finish Most of the cars were painted black with a thin red stripe down each side. The seat covers were of thick cloth material coloured grey or brown, while the interior d√©cor was characterised by painted metal, albeit combined with some wood trim. Engine Upgrade GAZ-11-73 (also referred to as the GAZ M-11) Towards the end of the 1930s the decision was taken to replace the by now rather dated Ford designed side-valve engine. Again, the manufacturer turned to the US auto-industry, this time to Chrysler. The engine selected was the six-cylinder unit fitted to the Dodge D5, which was considered relatively advanced at the time despite being a development of a unit that had originated back in 1928. The 3485cc unit produced which was far more power than that produced by the Ford designed units that had powered the earlier M-1s.–û –¥–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è—Ö –ì–ê–ó-20 –∏ –ì–ê–ó-11–û –¥–≤–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ –ì–ê–ó-11 The necessary drawings were purchased in 1937-38, and after all the measurements had been converted to their metric values the necessary tooling was created and volume production of this engine, now designated as the GAZ-11 unit, began in 1940. The same unit was the basis for power units fitted in the manufacturer‚Äôs Pobeda and in the larger Zim limousine. It also found its way into the remarkable all-wheel drive GAZ-61 as well as various military applications such as tanks and gun carriages. When equipped with the six-cylinder GAZ-11 engine, the car received a new radiator shroud and longer bonnet, and was designated GAZ-11-73, sometimes referred to as the GAZ M-11. Taxi use Plans to develop a dedicated taxi version of the M-1 were never fully realised, but there was nevertheless a demand for taxis in some cities which the M-1 fulfilled. The first 20 cars produced were introduced as taxis in Leningrad in 1936, and by the late summer of 1939 there were 20 of the cars being used for taxi work in Minsk. By that date there were 465 registered for taxi work in Leningrad and a further 2,740 in Moscow. Variants * GAZ-M21: Prototype 6x4 truck version.

Developed by South Carolina breeder Ed Currie, the pepper is red and gnarled, with a bumpy texture and small pointed tail. In 2017, Guinness World Records declared it the hottest chili pepper in the world, surpassing the previous record holder, the Trinidad Scorpion \\"Butch T\\". Other varieties may be spicier, such as Dragon's Breath or Pepper X but are not officially confirmed with a Scoville scale higher than the Carolina Reaper. Pungency 30-day-old Carolina Reaper plant Mature plant Mature plant The sensory heat or pungency detected when eating a Carolina Reaper derives from the density of capsaicinoids, particularly capsaicin, which relates directly to the intensity of chili pepper heat and Scoville scale. Bred in a Rock Hill, South Carolina, greenhouse by \\"Smokin\\" Ed Currie, proprietor of the PuckerButt Pepper Company in Fort Mill, the Carolina Reaper was certified as the world's hottest chili pepper by the Guinness World Records on August 11, 2017. The official Guinness World Record heat level was 1,641,183 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) in 2017, according to tests conducted by Winthrop University in South Carolina. The figure is an average for the tested batch; the hottest individual pepper was measured at 2.2 million SHU. The crossbreed is between a \\"really nastily hot\\" La Soufriere pepper from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and a Naga Viper pepper from Pakistan and is named 'Reaper' due to the shape of its tail. It has been described as having a fruity taste, with the initial bite being sweet and then immediately turning to \\"molten lava\\". In May 2017, Mike Smith of St Asaph, Wales, working with Nottingham Trent University, claimed to have surpassed the Carolina Reaper with his Dragon's Breath pepper, reported to be 2.4 million SHUs, and applied to Guinness World Records for confirmation. However, In September 2017, Ed Currie claimed to have bred a stronger pepper known as Pepper X having 3.18 million SHUs. Potential for severe headache In April 2018, a case report of \\"thunderclap headaches\\" in a 34-year-old man - who was hospitalized a few days after consuming one Carolina Reaper pepper of unspecified size in a contest - included a presumptive diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). With no reason to believe pepper compounds had a role in the mechanism of RCVS, other clinical interpretations, such as a stress response from eating such a hot pepper, may explain the headaches.  Cultivation  For growing, the pepper has been described as \\"a good all-rounder to try at home\\" by UK ethnobotanist James Wong, who said that they require temperatures of at least and suggested growing in pots to restrict growth and produce fruit sooner.

Finally, book reviews are published pertaining to aspects of the life, history, and culture of people of African descent and race relations.Afro-Americans in New York Life and History At the time of the journal's first publication, the success of Alex Haley's novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family (1976) had created an immense, new found interest in the African-American community for the discovery, preservation, and presentation of the often-overlooked rich cultural heritage that African Americans had established in the United States. Relevance The plight of African Americans in the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries can be connected to many different issues. The barriers of racism, economics and politics have greatly contributed to the oppression of people of color. These barriers continue to do so today. Whether purposefully or unknowingly actions in today's world due to these have left scars on society that have yet to heal. Afro-Americans in New York Life and History has played an important role in merging academic and community perspectives of African-American history and culture. Editors and Board of Directors As of July 2013, Seneca Vaught, professor of history and African Studies at Kennesaw State University, is the journal's Editor, aided by Associate Editors Clarence Williams of CUNY, Lillian Williams of SUNY at Buffalo, and Oscar R. Williams of SUNY at Albany. A variety of scholars who are interested in furthering the field of African- American history serve as Contributing Editors. In addition to Editorial supervision, the twenty-three member Board of Directors that oversees the Afro-American Historical Association of the Niagara Frontier also has input into the operation and contents of the journal.\\"Board of Directors and Editorial Board,\\" Afro-Americans in New York Life and History, Vol. 37 No. 2 (July 2013), p. 4-5 Notable issues The issues concerning this journal are aimed towards African Americans in New York, with prevalent issues brought to light and discussed in the volumes of Afro-Americans in New York Life and History. In 2005, the New York Historical Society held an exhibition titled Slavery in New York. An issue regarding Slavery in Albany, New York by Oscar Williams, Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010) emphasized that slavery was not limited to the south. In 1991, human remains by construction workers in lower Manhattan raised awareness of the African Burial Ground, where slaves in New York City were buried. Slavery was practiced into the 19th century. Most studies on slavery in New York have mentioned other New York cities sparingly. There is a failure on an understanding that slavery was widespread throughout New York. The capital, Albany, houses a special relationship of slavery beginning with the establishment of the Dutch West India Company in 1621. Another issue arose in regards to African-American prisoners as passive citizens. Themis Chronopoulos' article \\"Political Power and Passive Citizenship: The Implications of Considering African American Prisoners as Residents of Rural New York State Districts\\" explains how African-American prisoners who used to live in New York City were transferred to a rural prison, which has had critical political implications. This movement of prisoners has allowed more conservative legislators to hold a political office. State law dictates that prisoners have no rights but are still being accounted for in the population. Consequently, these conservative legislators have been generally hostile in regards to African Americans and their interest. If it was not for the urban population of upstate New York, numerous senate districts would have to be redrawn due to a lack of number of residents. The Republican Party would not be able to dominate the New York State Senate and downstate New York would be more politically powerful.\\"Political Power and Passive Citizenship: The Implications of Considering African American Prisoners as Residents of Rural New York State Districts,\\" Afro-Americans in New York Life and History, Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010), pp. 7-33.\\"Slavery in Albany, New York,\\" Afro-Americans in New York Life and History, Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010), pp. 154-166.

Biomed. Eng. 38, 1132‚Äì1140 (2010). He is currently chair of the Selection Committee that chooses the annual Sloan Awardees for the outstanding math and science teachers in the New York City public high schools.  Background and personal life  Weinbaum was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. His parents are Alex Weinbaum, who emigrated to the U.S. from Russia in 1921, and Frances (Stark) Weinbaum. He attended Jamaica High School, Queens, and Abraham Lincoln High School, Brooklyn, and received his bachelor's degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Aeronautical Engineering in 1959. He earned his MS in Applied Physics 1960 and his PhD in Engineering 1963 from Harvard University where he was a Gordon McKay Prize and then National Science Foundation Fellow. His dissertation is entitled ‚ÄúNatural convection phenomena in horizontal circular cylinders‚Äù and completed under the direction of George F. Carrier. He subsequently worked for the Avco Everett Research Laboratory and the General Electric Space Sciences Laboratory in Valley Forge, where he did research in high altitude aerodynamics. He developed what is now referred to as the Weinbaum-Weiss model of the high altitude laminar near wake. He became active in the anti-war movement of the 1960s and returned to academia in 1967 as an associate professor in the Department Mechanical Engineering at The City College of New York. He was promoted to professor in 1972, became a Herbert G Kayser Chair Professor in 1980 and a CUNY distinguished professor in 1986. Weinbaum married Alexandra Tamara Wolkowicz in 1962 and they have two children, Alys Eve Weinbaum and Daniel Eden Weinbaum.  Contributions to science and engineering  Weinbaum is widely recognized for novel biomechanical models that have changed existing views in such areas as bone fluid flow and mechanotransduction (how bone cells sense mechanical forces),Weinbaum, S., Cowin, S.C. and Zeng, Yu. \\"Excitation of Osteocytes by Mechanical Loading-Induced Bone Fluid Shear Stresses,\\" J.

In each case he resolved a long-standing ‚Äúmystery‚Äù by discovering either a new structure-such as micro-calcifications in the fibrous caps of vulnerable lesions or leaky junctions for transport of LDL across vascular endothelium- or a new function for a known structure ‚Äìsuch as by demonstrating that the glycocalyx on endothelial cells senses the fluid shear stress of the blood flow and transmits it to the intracellular cytoskeleton. He has also proposed a new concept for a high speed train where lift is generated by a giant ski riding on a soft porous material in a channel with impermeable side walls.Wu, Q., Andreopoulos, Y. and Weinbaum, S., ‚ÄúFrom Red Cells to Snowboarding to a New Concept for a Train Track,‚Äù Phys. Rev. Lett., 93, 194501-1-4 (2004). Weinbaum has been instrumental in the development of the biomedical engineering program at The City College of New York and CUNY. In 1994 he and Stephen C. Cowin established the New York Center for Biomedical Engineering and in 1999 they introduced the new CUNY PhD program in Biomedical Engineering. This led to the creation of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in 2002 and an undergraduate degree program in this field.  Contributions to diversity  Weinbaum is widely recognized as a pioneering advocate for women and minorities in science and engineering. As an untenured professor he was almost fired in 1969 for his role in supporting Black and Hispanic students in their takeover of the City College campus in their protest against existing admission policies. In 1977 he established the first summer outreach program at The City College for low income public high school students in science and engineering. In 1988 he received the Public Service Award of the Fund for the City of New York from Mayor Edward Koch for his role in recruiting women and minority faculty and students to the Grove School of Engineering. His 1992 class-action lawsuit Weinbaum vs. Cuomo (lead article Metro Section of the New York Times) brought national attention to the alleged racially discriminatory funding of higher education in New York State. The initial positive ruling was overturned on the New York State Court of Appeals in 1996 on the grounds that the state did not have to fund its two university systems CUNY and SUNY equally provided neither university had racially biased admissions. Weinbaum then turned his attention to encouraging high achieving underrepresented minority (URM) students to go to graduate school and pursue a PhD in a series of grants from the Sloan Foundation and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at NIH 1997‚Äì2013. The success of the latter program is described by Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Kenneth Cooper in ‚ÄúDiverse Issues in Higher Education‚Äù.\\"CCNY Minority Scholars Program shows success in nurturing Ph.D. aspirations of underrepresented students\\", Diverse Issues in Higher Education, 8/16/12 by Kenneth Cooper. Under the combined leadership of Weinbaum and John M. Tarbell, Chair of BME from 2004 to 2013, the BME Department has become widely recognized for the diversity of its faculty and graduate students. In the 2011 report of the National Research Council on doctoral programs in the United States the CUNY bioengineering PhD program ranked first nationally in diversity among the 74 ranked programs in the field. As of 3/9/18, 54% of its tenure track faculty and 74% of its PhD students are female and/or URM (24%) making it a leader among all STEM programs nationally. Of the 45 PhD students Weinbaum has mentored or co-mentored 17 are female and/or URM. Weinbaum has also played a leadership role in the nomination of women and minority researchers in both the NAE and NAS. He is currently Chair of the Temporary Nominating Group (TNG) for Class III of the NAS, Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Chair of the Temporary Nominating Committee (TNC) of NAE to identify such individuals.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 8, 2013. It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Bob Anderson. In the episode, when Principal Skinner promises that the most well-behaved at Springfield Elementary will get to ride in a submarine, Bart does everything possible to become a model student. Meanwhile, Krusty, on Lisa's advice, sells the foreign rights to his show in order to rake in more money, but the international Krustys' popularity soon outstrips his own. Plot Principal Skinner announces a school field trip in a submarine, but warns that only the best- behaved students will be allowed to go due to space limitations. Any student who breaks a rule is barred from going on the trip. He shows a video with the phrase Yvan Ehy Nioj (join the navy spelled backwards) on the screen, which is a reference to the season 12 episode New Kids on the Blecch. Bart behaves well in order to remain eligible, but Skinner crosses him off the list after he tracks mud into the school. After Bart unsuccessfully attempts to curry Skinner's favor and trick Skinner into reinstating him by impersonating President Obama, Homer sees how upset Bart is and decides to help him get revenge on Skinner. The next morning, Skinner finds his mother's corpse in the kitchen, stabbed to death. Homer and Bart soon discover the corpse despite Skinner's attempt to hide it, and Homer offers to clean up the mess and sends Skinner upstairs. Agnes stands up, uninjured and having taken part in the scheme, and Bart and Homer tell Skinner that the police are coming to arrest him. They provide him with a fake ID and a disguise and put him on a bus to Juarez, only to be shocked when he turns up at their house later that day. Skinner explains that he cannot run away from his crime, but also admits that he is probably glad to have killed Agnes. Marge and Agnes interrupt, having overheard this confession. Agnes revealed that she was really involved with Marge to find out Homer and Bart's plan. Agnes is angry that Skinner had wanted her dead and the fact that he broke his promise to Bart for one minor infraction. She decides to punish him further by being even meaner to Skinner by not taking the pills that keep her temper in check and orders him to return home at once. Now alone with Marge, she yells at Homer and Bart for plotting revenge on Skinner by trying to fake Agnes' death. Meanwhile, Lisa learns that Krusty the Clown has gone bankrupt. She suggests that Krusty sell the foreign rights to his show; he does so, demanding a large percentage of the stars' earnings. The foreign shows quickly become more popular than his own, but instead of doing the right thing in allowing the stars to keep more of their money, he offers to do a guest shot on every show. This suggestion angers them so badly that Krusty and his agent are forced to flee on a golf cart. While fleeing, Krusty admitted that he wanted to take the foreign shows' money because he was jealous of their success and he was the only one that was deemed a failure. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"While there are a fair amount of laughs along the way, ‚ÄòYellow Subterfuge‚Äô is a rushed, ramshackle enterprise, livened up by some solid Skinner-work.

The entirety of those three concerts is available on the box set A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo. Critical response The album has been critically praised as a strong collection of standout tracks from the band. AllMusic described the album as \\"a tour of the band's shiniest moments\\" that strips \\"their back catalog down to its most essential songs.\\" New Noise Magazine wrote that \\"If you already have all of the band's albums, then you really don‚Äôt need this one, but I certainly won‚Äôt say that it wasn‚Äôt a great idea to get this material out to people who haven‚Äôt been able to hear it yet, or even knew that it existed.\\" Fearnet also concludes that \\"If your only experience with A Perfect Circle comes via their movie soundtrack contributions and/or their higher-profile singles (which are quite impressive in themselves), this collection is an ideal way to catch up on the multi- textured and often experimental aspects of the band, and it represents their vast range of expression from rage-filled, angry anthems to thoughtful art- rock ballads, each of which bears Keenan and Howerdel's unforgettable artistic stamp.\\" Track listing Except where otherwise noted, all songs by Billy Howerdel and Maynard James Keenan. #\\"The Hollow\\" ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"Judith\\" ‚Äì 4:04 #\\"Orestes\\" ‚Äì 4:45 #\\"3 Libras\\" ‚Äì 3:35 #\\"Weak and Powerless\\" ‚Äì 3:11 #\\"The Noose\\" ‚Äì 4:54 #\\"The Outsider\\" ‚Äì 4:06 #\\"Blue\\" ‚Äì 4:09 #\\"When the Levee Breaks\\" (Douglas, McCoy) ‚Äì 5:54 #\\"Imagine\\" (Lennon) ‚Äì 4:47 #\\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\" ‚Äì 5:59 #\\"Passive\\" (Howerdel, Keenan, Lohner, Reznor) ‚Äì 4:10 #\\"By and Down\\" ‚Äì 5:33 = Deluxe Edition ‚Äì Disc 1 = #\\"The Hollow\\" ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"Rose\\" ‚Äì 3:24 #\\"Judith\\" ‚Äì 4:04 #\\"Orestes\\" ‚Äì 4:45 #\\"3 Libras\\" ‚Äì 3:35 #\\"The Package\\" ‚Äì 7:40 #\\"Weak and Powerless\\" ‚Äì 3:11 #\\"The Noose\\" ‚Äì 4:54 #\\"The Outsider\\" ‚Äì 4:06 #\\"Blue\\" ‚Äì 4:09 =Deluxe Edition ‚Äì Disc 2= #\\"Imagine\\" (Lennon) ‚Äì 4:47 #\\"Passive\\" (Howerdel, Keenan, Lohner, Reznor) ‚Äì 4:10 #\\"People Are People\\" (Live, 2011) (Gore) ‚Äì 3:44 #\\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\" ‚Äì 5:59 #\\"When the Levee Breaks\\" (Douglas, McCoy) ‚Äì 5:54 #\\"By and Down\\" ‚Äì 5:33 #\\"3 Libras\\" (Live, 2010) ‚Äì 6:11 #\\"Gravity\\" (Live, 2010) ‚Äì 5:10 #\\"Fiddle and the Drum\\" (Live, 2010) (Mitchell) ‚Äì 3:31 Personnel *Matt D'amico ‚Äì A&R; *Josh Eustis ‚Äì audio mixing *Tim Alexander ‚Äì drums *Josh Freese ‚Äì drums *Jeff Friedl ‚Äì drums *Steven R.

A Holocaust perpetrator, he served as the commandant of the Treblinka I forced-labour camp (Arbeitslager) in occupied Poland during its entire course of operation. Unlike the parallel Treblinka extermination camp (Treblinka II) subordinate to the Operation Reinhard authorities in Berlin, Treblinka I was controlled by the SS and Police Leader in Warsaw. The labour camp was liquidated on 23 July 1944, ahead of the Soviet advance. By then, more than half of its cumulative number of some 20,000 inmates had died from summary executions, hunger, disease and mistreatment. The regular workforce consisted of 1,000‚Äì2,000 prisoners, terrorized by staff of about a dozen SS- men and 100 Wachm√§nner guards. Career Born in D√ºsseldorf, Eupen received a law degree before World War II similar to other notable members of the Nazi Party such as Hans Frank, head of the semi-colonial General Government. Eupen joined the Schutzstaffel with the card number 4528. After the invasion of Poland he was promoted to the position of Commandant of Treblinka I in the summer of 1941, ahead of the camp's official founding which took place in November 1941. He supervised the building of barracks as well as barbed wire fencing tall, around the perimeter. Treblinka I was a gravel quarry equipped with heavy machinery, essential to the production of concrete and road construction. Before the German occupation, the mega quarry was owned by the Polish industrialist Marian ≈Åopuszy≈Ñski who built a railway track connecting the mine with Ma≈Çkinia‚ÄìSoko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski junction. Setting up a penal colony there was the idea of Sturmbannf√ºhrer Ernst Gramss who first ran it as his own personal business venture in occupied Poland. The quarry became vital during the German attack on the Soviet Union, supplying gravel for the strategic road-building programme around the German‚ÄìSoviet border. Historic site of Treblinka I Arbeitslager run by Eupen; with the memorial stone. Eupen was in charge of Treblinka I officially from 15 November 1941 (date of the camp's founding by Warsaw SS Governor Dr. Ludwig Fischer), until its closing on 23 July 1944. He worked closely with the SS and police commandanture in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews to the gas chambers of Treblinka II in early 1943, in order to have the slave labour brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for necessary replacements. He claimed to have been a German-Dutch aristocrat and liked to have his wife and two little sons visit him in occupied Poland. Eupen was feared even by his own SS subordinates penalized by being sent to the Eastern Front for even the smallest infractions. He arranged to have a garden built by his house with a pond and water fowl. Reportedly well- mannered, Eupen nevertheless had a reputation of a notorious sadist who often personally executed prisoners, \\"taking shots at them, as if they were partridges\\" wrote Franciszek ZƒÖbecki, the Polish station master. Prisoners who worked 12- to 14-hour shifts received watery soup for breakfast, similar soup for lunch, and the roasted-grain beverage with rye bread for supper, each loaf shared by the 10 of them. During the liquidation of the camp, some 500‚Äì700 inmates were executed by the SS in the forest, and all structures were burned to the ground. Eupen's luck ended shortly thereafter. He was killed by Polish partisans near Jƒôdrzej√≥w in mid December 1944, ambushed on the road. He jumped out of the car and ran on foot as far as Lip√≥wka village where he crawled under a pile of hay. The partisans machine-gunned his hiding place and learned who he was only from the documents they found on his corpse.

Two of his songs gained international popularity through other artists: * \\"Swear\\" was covered by Sheena Easton for her 1984 album A Private Heaven. * Bruce Springsteen recorded one of his songs, \\"High Hopes\\", on the Blood Brother EP (1996). The song, released by Springsteen as a single in November 2013, gave the title to his January 2014 studio album. McConnell started touring at the age of 15. He got his first recording contract with Sire Records in 1982. He then recorded for Geffen on his next record in 1985, called \\"High Lonesome Sound\\". McConnell headed the LA-based band The Havalinas. The band recorded one album The Havalinas and a live album called Go North. After the break-up of The Havalinas, McConnell did a series of solo albums and toured with a band. In 2007, he released his first Ledfoot album and started touring heavily in Europe solo.

This new style could not be defined by any existing music genre, so he invented a name for it. It is characterized by the unique artist's appearance: black clothes, shiny white hair, silver jewelry and a body full of tattoos ‚Äì many of which designed by the artist himself. He sings with expressive and strong voice, plays the 12-string mostly in Bb minor tuning with porcelain slide and steel finger picks. Extra heavy strings contribute to a unique, strong sound. Frequently Ledfoot adds some extra rhythm with his stomp box. Lyrics and melody are often dark and atmospheric and describe the blues and worries of modern time human beings.

It has served as the publishing house and national headquarters of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union since its construction in 1910. The organization had an important role in the national discussion on prohibition and women's suffrage. History The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded in Ohio in November 1874. It became the largest women's organization in the United States. Under president Annie Turner Wittenmyer, the WCTU organized national campaigns to advocate for temperance. These steps focused on literature publication, including a weekly newspaper dedicated to the cause. Evanston, Illinois resident Frances Willard became the organization's second president in 1879. Willard used her home in Evanston as an informal headquarters for the organization. Many of its rooms were converted into office and dormitory space for WCTU officials. Here, the WCTU began to expand to other causes, including child welfare, labor reform, prison reform, women's suffrage, age of consent laws, and abstinence. The ECTU moved into an official headquarters building in Chicago, designed by Burnham & Root, in 1890. Evanston had a lengthy history with temperance. The town was founded by Methodists seeking to build a university; Northwestern University opened in 1855. When Evanston was incorporated in 1863, its first act was to create an ordinance banning alcohol within a radius around the school. Because so many Evanston residents worked at the university, the act was popular. As Evanston grew to be considered an idyllic suburb in the 1870s, residents supported alcohol control as a way to preserve the residential climate. The first temperance organization in town, the Temperance Alliance, was founded around 1872. After Frances Willard returned from an east coast trip to meet with temperance leaders, she became a local leader in the movement. Willard died in 1898 and left her house to the WCTU in her will. In 1900, the WCTU left Chicago and officially moved to Evanston. An addition was constructed on Willard's former house in 1904 to print The Union Signal and The Young Crusader. After almost a decade in Willard's former house, the organization decided that it needed a new building to suit its needs. The WCTU Printing House, also known as the Literature Building, was built in the rear of the Willard property. The new printing capabilities allowed the WCTU to increase their efforts. In 1913, the WCTU teamed up with the Anti-Saloon League and the Prohibition Party to focus their efforts on legislative prohibition. A 1915 fundraiser raised enough money to create an addition to the building, allowing it to hold more administrative offices. As a result, the building was renamed the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Administration Building. In 1919, the WCTU's efforts came to fruition with the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution establishing prohibition. The Nineteenth Amendment followed the next year, approving women's suffrage. During prohibition, the WCTU harshly criticized the government for lax enforcement of the Volstead Act. Although prohibition was repealed in 1933, the WCTU continued to prosper. They continued to encourage individuals to abstain from alcohol and promoted local prohibition ordinances. A memorial library addition commemorated to Willard was constructed in 1938. By 1943, the WCTU was the largest temperance organization in the nation; by 1951, it had over a quarter of a million members.

Nancy Carter Nancy Carter, played by Maddy Hill, is the daughter of Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). She made her first appearance on 1 January 2014 when about to marry Wayne Ladlow (Malachi Kirby) in Watford. Wayne is instantly disliked by Mick who carries the intended bride over his shoulder to their family-owned pub, The Queen Victoria where Nancy will live. Nancy continues to see Wayne in Walford. Nancy departed from the serial on 22 April 2016. Wayne Ladlow Wayne Ladlow, played by Malachi Kirby, appears in episodes first broadcast in the UK between 1 and 23 January 2014. He is Nancy Carter's (Maddy Hill) fianc√© and first appears at his wedding to Nancy. Her parents Mick (Danny Dyer) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) arrive, and Mick dislikes the fact that Nancy is marrying Wayne so much that he picks her up and carries her out. Nancy's brother Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) locks the remaining guests inside the community centre where the wedding is taking place. Wayne soon arrives in Walford where he and Nancy resume their relationship in secret. Wayne stays in the local bed and breakfast, and flirts heavily with some of Walford's other women, including Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Mick hires Wayne to fix a damp problem in The Queen Victoria pub, but while he is doing the job Nancy discovers he has been showing private pictures of her to other boys in the pub, leading to her humiliating Wayne by showing everyone similar pictures of him. An angry Wayne then leaves Walford. Inside Soap reported that Nancy's parents Mick and Linda hate Wayne, and called him \\"feckless\\". Dyer said that Nancy is probably planning to marry him just to rebel against Linda. Hill opined that Wayne's exit scenes were \\"too satisfying to film\\". She said, \\"Nancy's not too bothered about Wayne at this point. She knows her parents don't like him so Nancy was basically just vying for their attention. In any case, I think that Nancy's always known she was too bright for Wayne\\". Aleks Shirovs Aleks Shirovs, played by Kristian Kiehling, made his first appearance on 24 January 2014. Kiehling auditioned for the role and said he was \\"so excited\\" when he learned he had won the role. Of his casting, Kiehling told from Digital Spy, \\"I'm very glad to be here. First of all I was thrilled and terrified to be joining the show! I was thrilled because it's a great honour for me to be here, but then terrified because Britain is a country of such great talent in terms of directors and actors, so it was overwhelming.\\" Kiehling explained that Aleks is a Latvian who is \\"very, very meticulous\\" and is serious about his business. He is introduced as a new market inspector who likes to do things by the book. On 16 April 2015, Treadwell-Collins confirmed that Kiehling had left the show. Commenting on the decision of his departure, Kiehling said: \\"Well that's a tricky one! Let's put it this way, we negotiated a new contract but we couldn't come to an agreement. I did get the hint that I would always be welcome back, so I can only say that I would be honoured if the situation arises and I get a second invitation. Never say never!\\" Kristian Kiehling, who portrays Aleks Shirovs. Aleks puts market assistant Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) on probation and warns him to prove himself if he wants to keep his job. He tells Tamwar that there are plans to merge the street markets and not to tell anyone. However, Tamwar's sister Shabnam (Rakhee Thakrar), leaks the news causing the market traders to rally together, led by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). He and Jake Stone (Jamie Lomas) rent a flat together. Aleks dates Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), on orders from her sister, Ronnie (Samantha Womack). When Ronnie calls their relationship off, Aleks is annoyed. When Ronnie fails to meet Roxy as planned, she calls Aleks and he comes to her rescue. The pair end up having sex, which infuriates Ronnie. Struggling to pay the rent, Aleks advertises for a third person to live with him and Jake. Fiona \\"Tosh\\" Mackintosh (Rebecca Scroggs) later moves in and shocks him when he learns that she is in a relationship with Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). Later, Roxy discovers that Ronnie paid Aleks and they have an argument but they stay together. Then, Aleks' young daughter, Ineta (Octavia Alexandru) talks to him over video chat, asking if he is coming home. Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) becomes suspicious when he finds Aleks talking to somebody over the Internet in Latvian and he angrily throws Alfie out. Alfie enlists Tamwar's help to hack into Aleks' laptop and see what he is hiding, and Tamwar tells Alfie that he has been contacting his wife. Alfie and Tamwar tell Roxy but she does not believe him, choosing instead to ask Tamwar about Alfie's discovery and he shows her the evidence. Later on, Roxy cooks Aleks a romantic meal and asks about his wife. He reveals he has a daughter, Ineta, and that he is married to Ineta's mother but they are separated. Roxy then throws Aleks out and buys him a plane tickets to Latvia but as he is about to leave, Roxy stops him, saying that she still wants to be with him. Aleks later nearly comes to blows with Alfie after he makes remarks about Aleks' marital status and later gives Alfie's pitch to rival market trader Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), despite Alfie excusing his absence on the day to illness, causing further tension between them. Roxy asks Aleks to show his commitment to her and he arranges a surprise holiday, proving to Roxy that he's committed and avoiding his wife Marta (Noeleen Comiskey) and their daughter who have arrived from Latvia. Aleks has sex with Marta in his office. Ronnie's partner, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), sees him and demands he tells Roxy, but Marta does before he can. She is devastated and throws him out; however, she realises her feelings for him are too strong and invites him to move back in. Marta goes home but leaves Ineta with Aleks, believing she will be better off in England. Aleks supports Charlie after the traumatic birth of his son Matthew following a car crash and, inspired by Dot, suggests the name Matthew. Charlie's wife, Ronnie, goes into a coma after Matthew's birth. Aleks learns that Roxy and Charlie have slept together so he goes to the hospital to tell Ronnie but cannot bring himself to do so. Tamwar begins to suspects Aleks after he takes an \\"advance\\" from the market office cash box, Tamwar later studies Aleks' records and works out that Aleks has been taking an extra maintenance fee but there is no record of it on the council receipts and he has been ripping off the traders. Tamwar confronts Aleks about it so he fires Tamwar and throws the evidence in the bin. Later, Tamwar visits Aleks and tells him that he is fired as Tamwar told the authorities about Aleks fiddling the books and the police have been called. Ineta rushes downstairs to answer the door to Marta as she had overheard their conversation about moving away and so called her mum. Roxy is torn between Aleks begging her to go with him and Marta suggesting that she would be breaking up a family and only to leave with Aleks if she loves him. Roxy decides that she cannot lie to herself any more and agrees that Marta is right. Aleks makes it clear that they will not see each other again so Roxy returns her engagement ring and kisses him goodbye and Aleks leaves before the police can catch him with Marta and Ineta leaving Walford.

A week later, it is Lee who saves Stan from a small fire at The Queen Victoria public house. The family meet at the hospital. When Mick asks him why he punched him, he confirms that he was in Stan's flat. Lee then has sex with Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), however she insists it was a one-night stand. He begins pursuing Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) instead, but later resumes his affair with Lucy. When Lucy is found dead after being murdered (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?), the police take a DNA sample from Lee, before he returns to the army. He returns as a surprise for Linda on her birthday. He bonds with his uncle, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), and becomes drunk at his mother's party. After passing out on Mick's bed, he tells his father he did something stupid in connection with Lucy. The next day, Lee reveals that he saw Lucy arguing with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick).

Lee's brother Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) shows an interest in him, knowing that he is gay, but Ben tells him he is no longer homosexual and insults Johnny with homophobic names, resulting in Lee viciously attacking him. Lee realises that Lauren Branning's (Jacqueline Jossa) alibi is suspicious when he views her outside Lucy's house on a video taken on the night of Lucy's death. He also later shares this information with the police investigating Lucy's murder. Lee and Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) later learn that Mick and Linda are not actually married as they had previously thought. During Christmas and the New Year after Johnny's departure to go travelling, Lee and Nancy become paranoid about the situation between their parents and Dean, who believe that Dean has done something wrong. Lee and Nancy are left in charge of The Queen Vic for several weeks while Mick and Linda go on holiday. Nancy is determined to know what Dean has done, but Shirley and Tina refuse to talk to Nancy without Mick and Linda's consent. When Shirley moves Dean in, Nancy is upset by this and Lee tries to talk Nancy into accepting Dean's presence while Mick and Linda are away. After throwing a party, Mick and Linda later return and are horrified to see Shirley behind the bar and Dean drinking in The Queen Vic. After reporting Dean to the police, Linda finally reveals to Lee and Nancy that Dean raped her and it is possible that he could be the father of Linda's unborn baby. Lee is angry to learn of this news and is determined to make Dean pay. Both Lee and Mick's tempers worsen when Dean continues to harass them and their family. Lee and Dean fight in the street when Dean denies attacking Linda and Mick makes it clear to Dean and Shirley to stay away from The Queen Vic, although Shirley decides to instead stand by him when Dean disappears for a few weeks. Lee is later happy when Linda proposes to Mick, who accepts. Lee and his family are upset to learn that Stan has died after he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The feud between Dean, Shirley and Mick continues, which begins to cause disruption for the other members of the Carter family. Dean is arrested on suspicion of breaking his bail conditions, but he is later released from prison. Linda gives birth to a baby boy, later named Ollie (Jack Tilley), after falling down the stairs and Lee is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that the baby may only be his half-brother. Mick talks Lee round to accepting the fact that the baby may be Dean's but he will always be the baby's brother, half or not. Lee is later relieved when he learns that Ollie is not Dean's, and visits Linda and Ollie in hospital, with the company of Nancy and Whitney. Lee begins to develop clinical depression, which leads to him missing work and being discharged from the Army when he punches one of his colleagues who flirts with Whitney. Lee is prescribed medication for his condition but he refuses take it. He gets a job at the local car lot, but Lee develops bitter feelings towards those around him, repeatedly shunning Whitney and his family. His worsening alcoholism nearly gets him sacked from the car lot, but Whitney convinces Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) to give Lee one more chance. Lee's mood improves when he makes a sale at the car lot and is invited to a Halloween party. However, a heavily pregnant Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) is electrocuted by a broken socket that Lee did not fix properly. Stacey's boyfriend Martin Fowler (James Bye) punches Lee and threatens to kill him if Stacey's baby dies. Lee breaks down in Whitney's arms when he realises the baby could be dead because of him and confesses to being drunk when fixing the socket, but is relieved when Whitney tells him that the baby and Stacey are not badly injured. He and Whitney are later invited to have lunch with Martin, Stacey, Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) and Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar) in The Queen Vic, where Martin apologises to Lee for punching him and forgives him for the incident. Days later, during Dean and Roxy Mitchell's (Rita Simons) engagement party, Lee gets drunk and confronts Shirley after finding out that she and Mick have been seeing each other secretly. During the argument, Lee tries to attack his grandfather Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), who escorts him out and takes him to the caf√©. Buster tells Lee that he needs to start taking his anti-depressants and stay focused on his career. He then returns him home and Lee tells Mick that he has no problem with him and Shirley seeing each other. Lee later knocks himself unconscious while trying to eject Dean from the pub, so is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. When he regains consciousness, he overhears Whitney confess to Mick via the baby monitor that she intends to break up with him after Mick and Linda's upcoming wedding, unable to handle his depression. On New Year's Day 2016, the day of the wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee then tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Dean turns up to the wedding after attempting to rape Roxy and pushes Shirley into a nearby lake, and Mick saves them both. The police subsequently arrive and arrest Dean for the attempted rape of Roxy. Later, when Phil turns up at The Queen Vic drunk and demands more drinks, Lee tries to escort him out but Phil, being the owner of the car lot, sacks him. Lee later works alongside Buster at his local fish stall, but sneaks off one afternoon for an interview with local landlady Thelma Bragg (Lorraine Stanley), whom was initially interested in hiring Nancy. Lee gets the job, but when Nancy, who was covering his shift for Buster, finds out, she calls him a spineless traitor before assuring him that he will not last long given his history of failure. Although Whitney praises Lee for getting the job, he walks away in misery. To assist with getting to work, Mick buys Lee a new car, which he takes Whitney for a drive in. During their drive, Whitney confesses to kissing Mick. An enraged Lee finds Mick and Linda at Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) restaurant and tries to attack them both. He later gets drunk and is thrown out of The Albert by Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) for insulting his wife, Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). He then bumps into an equally drunk Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) and they end up having unprotected sex. Whitney goes to stay with Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), where the next day, Nancy drops the rest of Whitney's belongings off as Lee is unable to face her after what happened with Mick. However, he later sees Abi talking to Whitney, and fears she may have told them about their one- night stand. Abi denies doing so, but tells Lee that Whitney is planning to leave Walford. Lee rushes to Sonia's house and begs Whitney to stay, finally confessing that he has not been taking his anti-depressants. When his family finds out, Mick furiously denounces him for lying, but Lee promises to ensure he gets better from now on. Later, when Whitney comes down to The Queen Vic after talking to Nancy, Lee asks her to marry him, and she accepts. Lee's relationship with Nancy is further tarnished when he reveals he told Thelma about Nancy's epilepsy, which further jeopardised her chances of getting the job. She then leaves The Queen Vic to move in with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) and works on her market stall. Lee eventually quits his new job following what he believes to be sexual harassment from Thelma, and decides to work at The Queen Vic, taking Nancy's old bartending job. Nancy joins everyone for a Mother's Day meal, but when she finds out Lee took her old job, they have another argument. Lee tells her that he is not surprised her boyfriend Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel) left her, prompting Nancy to angrily push Lee. He falls into Ollie's highchair, sending him and Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) crashing to the floor as Nancy and Whitney watch in shock. Mick and Linda rush back to find that Ollie has no apparent injuries, but Nancy and Lee continue to argue despite Mick and Linda's protests. Eventually, Mick loses his temper, smashing a chair and throwing Lee and Nancy out of The Queen Vic. When Linda later finds Ollie not breathing in his cot and later suffers a seizure, the Carters are told that Ollie may have brain damage, after hitting his head severely during Lee and Nancy's fight. Mick blames Nancy for the accident, and after months of feuding, he forgives her, however Nancy and Tamwar leave Walford to go travelling. When Whitney discovers she is pregnant, Lee worries that he would not be a good father due to his depression. They visit the doctors, but both Lee and Whitney are tested positive for chlamydia, which Lee caught from Abi. Lee lets Whitney wrongly believe that she had caught the STI during her past relationship with Rob Grayson (Jody Latham), who sexually exploited her. Abi confesses to Whitney about the one-night stand and she ends her relationship with Lee and considers leaving Walford, but after speaking to Linda, she decides to give Lee another chance, saying that having a baby with him would bring her the happiness that she needs. To make up for his mistakes, Lee takes Whitney to the registry office to book their wedding date. Two months later, Lee and Whitney are devastated when Whitney has suffers a miscarriage. Lee is agitated when he believes that him giving Whitney chlamydia may have caused the miscarriage. He cancels his stag party and promises Whitney that he will change and be a better boyfriend, only for her to tell him that she is moving to Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca. Lee is accepting of this and after Whitney reassures him that their relationship is not over, he watches her leave tearfully. However, Whitney returns the next day, admitting that she missed Lee. Lee tells her how much he wants to look after her and she tells him that she is sure that he will. Lee gets a job, telling everyone he is a sales executive in the city. However, he worries about how he will cope. After his first day at work, Lee uses a credit card to buy Whitney an expensive pair of earrings. Johnny (now Ted Reilly) worries about the amount of money that Lee is spending on his wedding, but Lee insists he is fine. Lee checks his bank account and sees he is ¬£250 overdrawn, and then applies for a ¬£2000 payday loan. Lee realises he should be honest with Whitney about the money but he backs out of telling her. When Abi realises Lee is not over Whitney's miscarriage, she tells him she should have told him about the chlamydia as she read that it could have caused the miscarriage, leaving him worried. Lee confronts Whitney over her miscarriage lie, and she admits that she worried how he would cope but now wants complete honesty, to which he agrees. However, he ignores reminders about repaying the loan. Johnny discovers Lee's debts and tells him to be honest with Whitney before they marry the following day. He attempts to tell her but she thinks he is stressed over not spending time together and tells him not to worry. Lee calls in sick to work so that he and Whitney can marry. On the wedding night, Lee pretends to be asleep when Whitney wants to consummate the marriage. It is revealed that Lee has lied about his job and he is working in a call centre and is the worst performer, and his boss realises (due to social media searching), he called in sick for his wedding, so docks his pay. Trapped in a depressed state, Lee cries at home but keeps the truth from his family. When Whitney surprises Lee at work, she assumes Lee's colleague Oz Bolat (Noah Maxwell- Clarke) is his employee. Whitney hopes to move to an expensive flat in Stratford and asks Lee to put a deposit on the flat but knowing he cannot afford it, he does not do so and tells her he was too late. However, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) offers one of his flats on Albert Square at a reduced rate so Whitney is happy but Lee still knows he cannot afford it. He asks his boss for an advance on his wages but is refused due to his poor performance. Lee then steals a sentimental piece of jewellery from Linda, attempting to pawn it, but he is not offered what he expected. He tells Shirley he cannot afford a flat, so she tells him that Whitney will be happy as long as she has him. He cheers up following Shirley's comment, but when Whitney buys a picture reading \\"home sweet home\\" for the flat, he steals charity money from the pub and tells Jack he has a deposit. Whitney and Lee move in but he makes excuses not to have sex with her and she worries when his mood swings return. When Whitney seduces Lee, he suffers erectile dysfunction due to his depression, though Whitney comforts him. Whitney then suspects Lee is having an affair, and when she tries to surprise him by visiting him at work, she finds out he has called in sick. He spends the day hiding in the allotments, briefly encountering Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who tells him that relationships built on lies never last. Whitney confronts Lee, accusing him of having an affair, but he says he was buying her a Christmas present. Whitney believes him and they finally have sex. At work, Lee is continuously harassed and bullied by his aggressive colleague Oz, who tells him he knows he was not sick the previous day and can prove it. Lee pushes Oz, but later apologises, saying it will not happen again. Oz agrees, revealing that he has slashed Lee's suit jacket. A few nights later, The Queen Vic is violently burgled by three masked men armed with baseball bats, who steal thousands of pounds of money and almost abduct Ollie during their thievery, while also striking Johnny across the face with a baseball bat. It is later revealed that the culprits are Oz and Lee's other colleagues and that Lee organised the robbery. However, Oz denies Lee his share of the money as he was supposed to make sure Whitney was not there as she could have recognised Oz, seeing this mistake as botching up the operation. Lee cries when he causes a paranoid Linda to jump. Whitney decides to host a Carter family Christmas lunch at her and Lee's home and refuses any financial contribution from Linda as Lee is doing well at work; when Lee hears the plan, he tries to secure another payday loan. When Whitney buys an expensive Christmas gift for Linda, Lee applies for a further loan but is refused. A package is delivered for his neighbour, which Lee opens to find a virtual reality headset, which he pawns for cash. On Christmas Day, Lee is arrested for conspiracy to commit robbery. The next day he is released without charge and tells Whitney and Mick that it was mistaken identity, but when Whitney angrily demands the truth, he admits that he told his colleagues that cash was kept in the pub overnight because he wanted to be liked and accepted. She calls him pathetic and says he disgusts her but says she will not tell Mick because he is dealing with the stress of Linda being in Spain with her mother Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), who has suffered a stroke. Lee asks Whitney to take a pregnancy test but she says she cannot get over that he was involved in the robbery, calling him \\"spineless\\". Lee is frustrated when he is late for work, crying and shouting at a parking attendant, Karen Beckworth (Sally Rogers), when a machine will not take his money. At work, Lee gets a sale, but Oz says the old woman he convinced to change energy supplier will lose money and could die when she finds out. Lee passes his review with Haroon, who tells him to \\"man up\\" in 2017 and Lee then sees a fitness poster reading, \\"2017, time to be a man\\". Oz catches Lee crying and calls him a \\"cry-baby girl\\", trying to take a photo on his phone and telling Lee that he would lose everything if his family and friends knew the truth, calling him \\"spineless\\", and Whitney would leave if she met a \\"real man\\". Lee goes to his car where he vents his frustrations, writes a note saying \\"I'm sorry\\", and leaves his car, heading for the edge of the roof of the car park where he contemplates suicide. Karen finds him; he says that unlike other people, he finds life hard and is pretending all the time, feels worthless and has seriously let his family down; Karen tells him he is not a bad person, and tells him life has its ups and downs, convincing him to come down and go to her office where she gives him a card from the Samaritans; after he leaves, she cries in front of a photograph of a boy. At home, Whitney tells Lee she is not pregnant but she wants to be, and he says they will take things one step at a time. Mick finds the Samaritans card in Lee's phone case and confronts him about it, asking why he would confide in a stranger and not his family. Lee finally confesses that he was in on the robbery of the Vic alongside his colleagues, before also admitting he had thought about suicide because of how bad he felt about the robbery. An enraged Mick tells Lee he should have gone through with the suicide, but later says he did not mean it but admits that he cannot forgive Lee, who breaks down in tears. Lee offers to accompany Mick to Ollie's next appointment but Mick refuses. He then tells Lee that while he is still not ready to forgive him, he will lend him money to clear his debt for Whitney's sake on the condition that Lee tells Whitney the truth about his job. When Lee tells Whitney the truth, she is devastated to learn that Lee lied because he thought she would be disappointed due to the lack of money his real job brings, but chooses to forgive him. After she tells Mick this, Mick forces Lee to give him Oz's address and returns with blood on his knuckles, sparking concern from Babe. When Lee next sees Oz, he has a black eye and tells Lee they should keep away from each other from now on. Lee and Whitney begin to argue over money and he blames Whitney for his financial difficulties. This causes much tension for the couple and he becomes increasingly jealous when Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) tries to kiss her. Whitney decides to stay at The Vic and Lee apologises to Whitney the next day for his behaviour. Babe gets the Carters into trouble with the law and when everyone turns against her, she reveals Lee's involvement in the robbery; resulting Johnny to become hostile to Lee. Whitney decides to pawn her wedding rings so she and Lee can afford a night out. She invites one of Lee's ex-army friends (\\"Beanbag\\") and persuades him to offer Lee a job in security after informing them that he is in Dover doing such a job. Lee thinks that Whitney is flirting with his friend which causes a row. When Whitney admits that she pawned her wedding ring, she tells Lee that she wishes that he was more like Mick. Lee hits her in a rage of anger and is instantly wracked with guilt. He begs Whitney for forgiveness, but she lays on their bed in silence clearly frightened of Lee. The next day, Whitney decides to forgive Lee on the condition that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of working out their marriage. On Valentine's Day, Mick tells Lee that the best thing he can do for Whitney is to leave her. Despite this, on his way to work, Lee talks to Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who gives him advice on his marriage. Lee then treats Whitney to a romantic dinner, and just after asking for the bill, Lee tells Whitney that he has left a surprise for her back at the flat and insists he should go back. While waiting for him to return, Whitney realises that Lee has gone for a long time, so she returns to their flat, only to find all of his belongings are gone and reads a handwritten note from Lee saying he no longer loves her. Whitney attempts to contact him, to no avail, not knowing that Lee has called Mick requesting to see him. Mick meets Lee, who tells him that he is going to remain in Dover because he cannot stay in Walford. He returns to Walford briefly to see Whitney and tearfully explains the situation. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. After saying a tearful farewell to his family, Lee leaves after Mick tells him that Walford will always be his home. Several weeks later, Lee attempts to call Whitney but the pub's new manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal and Whitney agrees, deciding it is time to move on from Lee. Over two-and-a-half years later, during Christmas, Mick contacts Lee and asks him to come back to Walford to surprise Linda. However, he returns to find her in a drunken, unconscious state on the ground. Lee rushes her mother to hospital and questions her and Mick repeatedly about her behaviour. He also confesses that he is in a relationship with a woman named Sophie. Linda denies having a drink problem. Lee soon discovers that Mick has been having panic attacks and is shocked to see the animosity between his parents. He admits to Linda that he once tried to commit suicide as he felt he could not talk to anyone, and he urges her to talk to Mick. Meanwhile, Whitney is angry with Lee for not talking to her about their divorce and blaming her for the breakdown of their marriage. Lee apologises to her, saying that she did not deserve the way he treated her. Whitney then admits that she is scared to leave her house, due to being stalked by Leo King (Tony Wells). Lee advises her to fight back. Buoyed by Lee's advice, Whitney dresses up for New Year's Eve and Lee is proud of her and they agree to be friends. On New Year's Eve, Linda becomes unhealthily drunk and is even disorderly with Mick and Lee. Lee departs the Square once again after advising Linda to stop arguing with Mick. Donna Yates Donna Yates,Spotlight: LISA HAMMOND played by Lisa Hammond made her first appearance on 14 April 2014.BBC One ‚Äì EastEnders, 14/04/2014 Donna was not originally a disabled character, but this was changed when Hammond, who has dwarfism, impressed producers during her audition. Donna is the second regular disabled character to appear in EastEnders after Adam Best (David Proud). Donna is a market trader, who clashes with rival stall holders Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace). Donna has foster parents. Lisa Hammond starred in the series as Donna Yates between 2014 and 2018. In an interview with Inside Soap, Hammond said, \\"there will be a humorous side to Donna.\\" Despite being billed as aggressive and difficult, Hammond insists that she will not be totally unlikeable. She continued, \\"Initially, Donna is very opinionated. But there is a humorous side to her. I don't want her to just be a hard-faced cow. There needs to be a glint in her eye, tinged with a bit of sarcasm as well. It was hard to launch into being such a fiery character. Once I settled in, I thought, 'This is fun ‚Äì people will hate me!'\\" It was reported that her character would get on the wrong side of Bianca and Kat immediately, following their assumption she is from the council. Hammond said: \\"Not only did I come in on my first day as someone who is difficult and a bit nosey, but I had to do it with Kat and Bianca! They are really strong women, so it was daunting. But Patsy (Bianca) and Jessie (Kat) have always been a good laugh in between scenes, so it was very easy to settle in.\\" She also confirmed that her mentor is Patsy Palmer; \\"Patsy is my mentor. She told me to come straight to her with any questions.\\" Hammond was nominated for Best Bitch at the Inside Soap Awards in 2014 for her portrayal as Donna. In August 2017, Hammond was longlisted for Funniest Female at the Inside Soap Awards. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. Following the decision to merge Spring Lane market with Bridge Street market, Donna arrives to assess the competition. Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) assumes she is from the council and questions her. When she discovers she is a stallholder, she is furious to discover that the Spring Lane stallholders already know about the decision to merge. Later, Donna is hostile towards Kat and Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) as she also sells clothes. When the Spring Lane traders arrive, Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) asks Donna to wear a black armband as a mark of respect for Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who has recently been killed. However, Donna refuses as she does not want to put buyers off. It later becomes clear that Donna fancies Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and takes a disliking to Terry's former wife, Nikki Spraggan (Rachel Wilde). Donna is later rude about Patrick Trueman's (Rudolph Walker) stroke, and clashes with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), a fellow stall holder. Donna's one ally on the market is Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), a former social worker who now has a flower stall there. It is later revealed that Pam was once Donna's social worker and placed her with her long-term foster family. Pam helps Donna see the brighter side of life, encouraging her to make peace with Kat and getting her a date for Valentine's Day. After Donna and Fatboy clash when he is looking after the Beales' fruit and vegetable stall Pam encourages the two to make amends, with Donna offering an olive branch by helping Fatboy with his supplier receipts. Later, Donna lies about a salon appointment to go to the hospital but when she cannot find a taxi, Fatboy drives her. She confesses to Fatboy privately that she goes to the hospital regularly for blood tests and painkiller injections in hopes of prolonging the energy she has before undergoing joint replacement, and that she did not want Pam to worry about her. Pam plans a party for Donna's 30th birthday, where Martin Fowler (James Bye) shows an interest in her. When it becomes clear this is only down to Martin trying to annoy his estranged wife Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), Fatboy punches him, and an upset Donna leaves the party. However, she is pleased when Pam reveals she has secretly invited her foster mother Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), and is touched when Fatboy gives her a hoodie as his present to her. Her foster brother, Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), visits her and reveals that he is Kim Fox's (Tameka Empson) husband and the father of Kim's daughter Pearl, leaving her shocked. She later goes for a drink with Vincent, to the surprise of Kim, who confronts the pair believing that Donna is Vincent's date. Donna reveals that she is Vincent's sister and when Donna calls Kim's half-sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) a \\"dog\\", Kim stabs a tyre on Donna's wheelchair with a fork. Vincent invites Donna to Kim's birthday party at The Albert, where she upsets Kim by revealing Vincent's involvement with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). After Nancy Carter's (Maddy Hill) 22nd birthday party, Donna and Fatboy kiss and end up having sex. The next morning, they enjoy the gossip around them, but Fatboy feels that it is making their friendship awkward, and later tells Donna this, but she does not take it well and goes to Claudette's house in tears, saying that she wants a long-term relationship with someone who will love her for who she is. Donna then finds Pam's husband, Les Coker (Roger Sloman) in her house in just his underwear, and concludes that they are having an affair, but despite them both denying it, she tells Pam what she saw. When Vincent finds out about Fatboy's treatment of Donna, he angrily confronts him and locks him in a staircase as punishment. The next day, on Vincent's advice, Fatboy tells Donna that he will now be known as Arthur and will be showing his true self to her from now on. Although initially confused, Donna accepts this. However, the relationship does not last and Fatboy soon leaves Walford. Donna is confused when Claudette disappears, so Vincent says that Claudette left after an argument with Kim and is staying with her sister Cynthia, but Donna discovers this is a lie. Donna later reveals to Vincent that Claudette had told her that Vincent buried her in his basement after she fell down the stairs during a scuffle with Patrick. Vincent says Claudette killed her husband, Henry, but Donna does not believe him, so he reveals that Claudette had indirectly killed Fatboy. Donna tells Vincent and Claudette to leave, but Patrick arrives and confirms that Vincent is telling the truth about Henry. Claudette claims Henry's death was an accident and threatens to go to the police if Patrick calls the police on her, but Donna accuses Claudette of only fostering her to ease her guilt. Vincent tells Claudette to leave Walford, and gives Donna Fatboy's necklace. Donna tells him they should stick together as he is now the only family she has left. However, several months later, Claudette returns to Walford and Donna starts meeting her in secret, but fails to convince Vincent to talk to Claudette. When there is no market inspector, the market turns to anarchy, upsetting Donna. She fails to do anything about it and gets drunk, later asking Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) to father a child for her, but she regrets it the next day. Pam encourages Donna to apply to be market inspector. Donna later asks Vincent if he will be the father of her baby. He eventually agrees and reluctantly tells Kim the plan, who is against it. Kim calls Claudette to try to stop the plan but Claudette is supportive despite Vincent still hating her, and Vincent manages to convince Kim. Donna inseminates herself with Vincent's donated sperm, and Kim, realising how hard it will be on her family, attempts to stop it but she is too late. However, Donna does not get pregnant. Donna is determined to keep trying but when she finds out Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) is pregnant and Whitney says she would not be able to raise a baby on her own, Donna realises she will not be able to look after a baby by herself and decides to stop trying for a baby, with Kim reassuring her that she will find the right man. When a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct, Vincent finds parts of Donna's wheelchair when helping the injured. He eventually finds her lying conscious in the alleyway of The Queen Victoria pub.

She is delighted that her husband Les has bought 53 Turpin Road for their funeral parlour. The following week, the couple move into the upstairs flat, and Pam opens up her flower stall as the Spring Lane street market has been merged with the Bridge Street market. Pam is not in competition with anyone. She enjoys listening to the arguments and gossip between other rival stall holders. While Pam babysits for Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) and Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), she discovers photographs of the recently murdered Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) behind Billy's fridge. Pam confronts Billy who explains that the photographs of Lucy are not his but are her twin brother Peter's (Ben Hardy). Pam befriends Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) and helps her organise a naked charity calendar, posing nude herself with Mo Harris (Laila Morse) for the month of April. She becomes upset when DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) tells her that secrets always have a habit of revealing themselves. On the anniversary of her son, Lawrie's, death, she goes missing with Janet. When she returns with Janet, Billy is upset with her. Pam discloses to Emma that she used to be a social worker until accusations were made that she brought about the death of Lawrie, her terminally ill son; telling Emma that the accusations were false, but confessing to Billy that they were true. When Billy discovers the funeral parlour is in trouble because Les cannot bring himself to push bereaved families to pay overdue bills, Billy insists Les tell Pam the truth. Les is unwilling to upset Pam on their anniversary, but eventually confesses, and the pair agree to have no more secrets. However, Les is then revealed to be secretly meeting another woman to whom he gives a necklace. When Pam organises a 30th birthday party for Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) soon afterwards, she secretly invites Donna's foster mother Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) ‚Äì the same woman Les is secretly meeting. It is then revealed that Pam placed Donna in Claudette's care when she was a social worker and that the two are good friends. Les and Pam's grandson, Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), comes to stay in Walford with them after a two-year absence, despite animosity between him and Les as he believed he had found out Les and Claudette were having an affair before his departure. Two months later, Paul tells Pam that Les is having an affair with Claudette. Pam tries to confront Claudette about the affair, but loses her nerve. Pam uneasily tells Paul to stop thinking about the affair but later freaks out when she sees Claudette in the photo with her and Les in the newspaper, and admits to Paul that he is, in fact, right about it. Pam tries to arrange a dinner with Les and Claudette, but they both decline, secretly meeting up at Claudette's house. Pam finds Les' tie at Claudette's house and they both give conflicting explanations to her. She later goes to stay with her sister Mim Crabbe (Helen Cotterill), returning to find Les and Claudette together, with Claudette encouraging Les to tell Pam the truth. Les tries to explain that he and Claudette grew close after Lawrie's death when he needed someone to talk to, but it has only ever been platonic. Pam seeks advice from single mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), who encourages her to work on her marriage and seek some more answers from Les. Pam then issues Les an ultimatum: he must stop seeing Claudette or she will leave him. On Lawrie's birthday, Pam is too upset to speak to Les, so he visits Claudette. Donna finds Les in his underwear at Claudette's house, and tells Pam what she has seen. Pam then goes to Claudette's house and sets about destroying Les's gifts until Claudette says they are not hers and Pam should ask Les about Christine. When Pam confronts Les, she is horrified to discover that Christine is his feminine alter ego and that he enjoys wearing women's clothes, and tells Les he disgusts her, but restrains herself from telling Paul. The next day, she is still not coping with the revelation, but Donna and Claudette encourage her to speak to Les about it. After speaking to Les, she decides she wants to \\"meet\\" Christine. Whilst preparing Les for the \\"meeting\\", Claudette comforts a worried Pam, telling her the first time she \\"sees\\" Christine will be easier than she thinks. Upon \\"meeting\\" Christine, Pam is initially cautious, but after Les, as Christine, explains that this is how he can cope with things, as Christine is more open than Les, and he is still the same person, she becomes slightly more reciprocate. However, when Paul walks in on them and is horrified, Pam realises she knows nothing about her husband in his feminine form, so leaves to get some distance from Les. She stays with Donna overnight and then makes plans to visit Mim again, although Paul arrives at the train station to stop her. She later returns home to talk to Les, but when she gets hesitant again, Les moves out to give Pam some space and time as her friends and her job are clearly in Walford. Paul makes efforts to reunite Pam and Les but it is tense and awkward. When Paul suddenly becomes withdrawn from them, they both confront him and he confesses his relationship with Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), revealing he is in love with him. Les urges Paul to tell Ben his feelings, leaving Pam impressed with Les' approach at advice. Les admits to Pam that he is still in love with her, and she says she loves him too, but she is not ready to get back together with him yet. After another encounter with Les at the pub, where she admits she is unable to get the image of Christine out of her head when she sees him, Les calls Pam, telling her to meet at the allotments where he plans to burn Christine's things. She reluctantly watches as Les burns the things and allows him to walk her home. Several days later, Pam allows Les to move back in with her, but as she is still not ready to consummate their marriage, she orders single beds for her and Les. However, Pam and Les starts being blackmailed by Babe Smith (Annette Badland) after she finds a photograph of Les dressed as Christine at the allotments and she regularly demands money from them. Pam is then shocked to see Paul's estranged biological mother Jenny Rawlinson (Amy Marston) in Walford and she demands to meet Paul, but Pam refuses. When Les suffers a heart attack, Pam and Les decide to let Paul and his boyfriend, Ben, to continue with the family business at the funeral parlour. Following a night out with Ben, Paul is later killed off-screen in a suspected homophobic attack. Initially, Pam denies that it is Paul, but later identifies him in the mortuary with Les. When everyone proposes a toast in Paul's memory, Pam blames Ben for causing Paul's death, wishing it was him who had died instead of Paul. Pam and Les are later relieved when Claudette helps them expose Babe's blackmail. At Paul's funeral, Pam makes a truce with Ben after hearing his emotional eulogy for Paul and later decides to allow Les to be Christine, realising that she may need him to show this side of his personality. Before a bail hearing for Paul's murder, Pam meets a woman in the toilets and comforts her, but later realises she is actually the mother of one of Paul's killers. Paul's killers are refused bail and Pam escorts Les out of the courtroom. When they return home, Pam and Les consider leaving Walford together after the trial is over. Pam decides to visit Diane Atmore (Hazel Ellerby), the mother of Simon Atmore (Tom Palmer), one of Paul's killers, to try to get her to persuade him to plead guilty. Les thinks this is a bad idea as Pam could scupper the whole case. Pam messages Diane with Honey's assistance and arranges to meet her. Accompanied by Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth), she meets Diane who tells her she will not persuade Simon to plead guilty. However, she ends up doing so and at the hearing, Simon and the rest of Paul's killers plead guilty to killing Paul and to kidnapping Ben and Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). They are sentenced to thirty years in prison. Pam asks Ben to help her clear out Paul's bedroom. She then drops off his clothes to a homeless shelter where she is stunned to find Jay who has been sleeping rough. She persuades him to come back to the Square for Ben's sake, and she convinces Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) to allow Jay back into the Mitchell household. At a farewell party for the Cokers in The Vic, Pam confronts Babe‚Äîwho has recently returned the money she took from them‚Äîand tells her that she is a sad, pathetic old woman who she feels sorry for and that she will never have what she and Les have. After making an emotional farewell to all their friends, handing over the funeral parlour to Billy to manage and persuading Billy to give Jay a job, Pam and Les depart Walford for a new life in Worthing. Pam returns for Honey's housewarming party and tells Ben that he needs to move on from Paul. Before leaving, Pam tells Billy that Les is very impressed with his running of the business and offers him a partnership and wants to rename the company Coker and Mitchell. When Billy gets himself involved in a heist with former criminal Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin), he ends up illegally digging up a grave. The following month, Pam returns and tells Billy that his act has been caught on CCTV and has resulted in a bad reputation for the business. She appoints Jay as the new manager and fires Billy.

Emma supports the Beales as they mourn Lucy's death and becomes familiar with the residents of Albert Square during the early days of the investigation. However, she meets Max Branning (Jake Wood) in the Bridge Street caf√© and they both strike a bond after she confides in him about the breakdown of her engagement. Emma and Max begin a relationship but they keep it secret because Max is a suspect in the investigation and she knows that it could put Emma's job at risk. Emma gets a new boss, DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman), who dislikes Emma. She is further worried when she discovers Keeble had investigated Max before. Max is suspicious of Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) and the two have a rivalry but Charlie discovers Emma and Max's relationship, which infuriates Max. Emma does a background check on Charlie and finds out that he is impersonating a police officer. Emma tries to arrest him but he tells Emma he is a Special Operations Officer and threatens to report her unless she breaks up with Max. Emma, frightened at the prospect of losing her job, ends her relationship with Max who retaliates by placing an anonymous call to the police about their affair. Emma is immediately taken off the case and is suspended from the force. Max tries to reconcile with Emma, but she reveals that she is still engaged to her fianc√©, who turns out to be DS Cameron Bryant. Emma tells Max that she loves him and has left Bryant for good because of the way that he treated her when they were together. Emma then introduces Max and his daughters, Lauren (Jacqueline Jossa) and Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald), to her parents, Henry (Will Knightley) and Margot (Jill Baker), who initially dislike Max. However, they eventually accept him and Emma moves from Clapham into Max's home. Whilst she is facing a disciplinary hearing, Keeble asks Emma to give hand over Lauren's laptop; something Emma refuses to do as it is breaking the police rules. However, when reminded that she could lose her job, Emma gives Keeble the laptop, but soon regrets this and later confesses to Lauren what she has done. The police find suspicious activity on Lucy's social media site, which was down to Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), but they also discover that Abi knew about Max and Lucy's affair. Despite helping Keeble, Emma loses her job. Bryant tells Emma it was Max that placed the anonymous phonecall to the police about their relationship, and she angrily ends her relationship with him due to this. However, she finds an anonymous envelope addressed to her, which was posted by Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), containing proof that Lauren was not truthful about her alibi. After viewing the clip, Emma shows it to Lauren, who tells her that she went to the Beale household because she wanted a drink and wanted to see Lucy. However, Lauren worries that Emma is just using her to spy on her family. Later that night, Max admits to Emma that her passion for her job is what made him fall in love with her, and that he only acted out of fear of losing her. She later admits to Max that she is also scared of their relationship not ending well, and both admit neither of them want it to end, so agree to try to start again from scratch. Emma spends Christmas Day with the Branning and Beale families, but ends up asking questions about Lucy, which upset the others. She then arranges drinks in The Queen Victoria pub with both families, and uses it as an opportunity to pry.

Max takes Emma to hospital after she bleeds from the ear but she later dies from a brain haemorrhage. In February 2015, shortly after Ian's wedding to Jane, he finds out that his son Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) killed Lucy and that Jane has been covering for him. Jane admits to meeting with Emma at the park on New Year's Day in an attempt to stop her going to the police. She reveals that Emma suspected she lied about her alibi about her being at Masood Ahmed's (Nitin Ganatra) house at the time because Max had video footage showing that her car was not there.

She said \\"I had cause to give people tea in a time of crisis. I said to them, 'Can we just take out any vocal offer of tea? I'll put the tea in front of them'. I had to come in with the tray and teacups. People thought I was doing this as a nod to Father Ted, but I wasn't. It was in the script!\\" Yvonne first appears when her former mother-in-law, Dot Branning (June Brown), and her friend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) text her from her son, Charlie's, mobile phone and they agree to meet at the local launderette.

Sarah Deen from the Metro said of the twins' arrival: \\"The lovely scene with Kat and Alfie cuddling their healthy newborn sons is probably the most positive thing EastEnders viewers have seen in months. The mass outpouring of love on Twitter for two fictional characters was quite something.\\" Bert and Ernie do not appear in the spin-off series Kat & Alfie: Redwater, in which Kat and Alfie travel to Ireland, because Dominic Treadwell- Collins knew that having two small children in the series would have \\"limited Kat and Alfie and they wouldn't have been able to do as much\\", though revealed that they were originally due to appear, but \\"suddenly you ended up having storylines about who is looking after the twins and on a show like this we needed to tell other stories\\" and confirmed that Kat and Alfie have only left them for a few weeks and check on them during the series.

Stacey swears a reluctant Kush to secrecy and he marries Shabnam and departs with her for their honeymoon. When Kush and Shabnam return, Kush learns on the day of Jade's hearing that Shabnam took Jade without permission. Kush and Shabnam decide not to go for custody of Jade when they realise they have not come to terms with Zaair's death. When Stacey's son Arthur Fowler is born, Shabnam thinks Kush could be the father from his behaviour, and confronts Stacey, worried she will lose her husband, but Stacey tells her he is not the father, so Shabnam finds Kush and passionately kisses him. However, Shabnam later hears Kush talking to Carmel about Arthur being his son, and Shabnam begins to re-evaluate her marriage. She wants to tell Martin the truth about Arthur's paternity, but when Stacey's mental condition worsens, she and Kush agree to wait and Kush vows to prioritise Shabnam over Arthur. Kush suggests to Shabnam that they move away, but she decides to leave on her own, urging Kush to stay for Arthur. Masood finds out about this and Arthur's paternity, so punches Kush and threatens to kill him if he comes near Shabnam again, and tells him that Shabnam has already decided to leave Walford. Kush then breaks down in Carmel's arms, thinking he has lost Shabnam for good. Despite Kush's pleas, Shabnam leaves Walford with Jade after planting a tree in Zaair's memory, telling Kush that they must lead separate lives, but she still loves him. Kush then starts drinking heavily and Martin finds out that Kush is Arthur's father. Stacey tells Kush that he can be a part of Arthur's life, but Martin disagrees and breaks his friendship with Kush. An emotional Kush has sex with Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill), but she suffers an epileptic fit in his bed. Kush calls Nancy's former boyfriend, Tamwar, who calls Kush selfish. Kush realises he is a bad role model so tells Stacey and Martin that he wants nothing to do with Arthur. Tamwar calls Carmel, who agrees to move in with Kush. Carmel then reveals to Kush that his father has sold their house and she is homeless. Kush develops feelings for Carmel's best friend Denise Fox (Diane Parish). They admit their feelings to each other and they have a brief fling, however, she ends it, fearing it will ruin her friendship with Carmel. Kush later discovers from Carmel that Denise is pregnant and believes he is the father, but Denise tells him he is not as she is 18 to 19 weeks pregnant. Kush later advises his younger brother Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) when he wants to have sex with his girlfriend, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), who is Martin's daughter. When the explicit image Shakil sent to Bex goes viral around Shakil's school, Bex is blamed, even though Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) was the one who sent it. This causes things to become fraught yet again between the Kazemis and the Fowlers. Kush pursues Denise again but she turns him down due to her friendship with Carmel. However, when Kush is in the fish and chip shop after having a drink with Denise, Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) crashes into it, leaving him unconscious. Denise helps rescue Kush, and while he is in hospital, she admits her feelings for him and they start a relationship. Back home, Carmel interrupts Kush and Denise one morning, but assumes that Kush has met a doctor from the hospital, which he confirms. Denise tells Kush that they should admit to their relationship from the start, so they tell Carmel, who is shocked, and says that when the relationship ends, she would be forced to take Kush's side and would lose her friend forever. Kush asks Denise to move in with him but she declines where Kush accuses her of comparing him to her controlling ex-husband, Owen Turner (Lee Ross). Kush storms off and goes into cardiac arrest in the middle of the market, and is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome. Denise regrets rejecting him and spontaneously proposes to him in the hospital; he accepts. Later, Kush's other brother, Darius Kazemi (Ash Rizi), offers him work in Dubai but Kush and Carmel are left devastated when Shakil, while returning a stolen bike taken by his friend, dies after being stabbed by a gang. When Kush and Denise end their relationship, he begins having a secret sexual relationship with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). The pair decide to keep it a secret due to the complicated relationship Kush has with the Slaters and Fowlers, but when they are caught having sex, they admit to being together. When Kush sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) being harassed on a balcony by Leo King (Tom Wells), he rushes to her defence, and accidentally pushes Leo over the balcony. =Reception= Ghadami was nominated for Best Newcomer at the British Soap Awards in 2015 for his portrayal as Kush,EastEnders tops British Soap Awards 2015 shortlist but lost out to Doctors Jessica Regan, who plays Niamh Donoghue.

Sylvie Carter Sylvie Carter, portrayed by Linda Marlowe, is the estranged wife of already established character, Stan Carter (Timothy West) and is the mother of Shirley (Linda Henry), Tina (Luisa Bradshaw-White) and was also thought to be the mother of her grandson, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), until May 2014. She was also the great grandmother of Johnny Carter (Sam Strike/Ted Reilly), Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) & Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and Ollie Carter.She initially appeared in 11 episodes, from 11 December 2014 to 22 January, which later extended to 14 episodes, due to three further appearances on 10, 23 and 24 April 2015. Sylvie returned for a single episode on 1 January 2016 for Mick's wedding to Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), before reappearing as a regular from 14 June 2016 until the character's death on 30 March 2017. Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap praised the 2017 scene where Sylvie told Tina about her childhood abuse, saying, \\"all praise to EastEnders for the beautifully written and acted scene where Sylvie recalled her brutal treatment at the hands of her mum. Bravo to all.\\" Actress Linda Marlowe was cast as Sylvie Carter in 2014. Sylvie is first mentioned in January 2014, when Stan and Shirley reminisce about she left them when they were children, over 30 years ago. In December 2014, Shirley and Mick visit their aunt, Sylvie's sister, Babe Smith (Annette Badland), and discover that she has been living with her, since her diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, five years previously. Although she is still hostile towards Shirley, she takes a shine to Mick and when he cannot get hold of Babe, he and Shirley take Sylvie back to their home in Walford. Babe is angry to discover this, especially when she goes missing and when Sylvie is found, Babe takes her home. On Christmas Eve, Mick, Shirley and Babe take Sylvie out for lunch, to which Mick gets her a present, but Sylvie remains hostile to Shirley. At the end of the meal, Sylvie tells Mick that she wants to spend Christmas with him and his family and Babe brings her to their pub, The Queen Victoria, the following day, upsetting Stan. When Stan learns the truth about Mick's parentage, as he is Shirley's biological son, he blames Babe, who then abandons Sylvie and she moves in with them. Later, Stan attempts to talk to Sylvie, but she ignores him and this causes him to snap at her. When Babe eventually decides to take Sylvie home, she informs Stan that he did make her happy, before leaving, returning briefly for a dance party at the local community centre, where she kisses Stan. Babe is angry that Sylvie has left home, without her permission and also reveals that she had a crush on Stan, before him and Sylvie became a couple. When Babe announces that she is struggling to take care of Sylvie and that she is going to put her into a care home, they arrange a leaving party for her and her and Stan reminisce, about how they used to love each other. When Shirley sits down and explains to Mick why she could not be a mother to him, revealing that it was Sylvie and Babe's fault, as they tried to cause her to miscarry, by pushing her down the stairs, and would not even let her hold him, when she had just given birth to him, he disowns them. In April 2015, Babe takes Sylvie to see Stan, who is terminally ill, in a hospice, in the hope of causing trouble between him and his new fianc√©e, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). However, Stan and Sylvie admit to each other that they made the right decision to separate and take off each other's wedding rings, before saying an emotional goodbye. Sylvie later appears when Babe returns from Stan's funeral and reveals to Sylvie that Stan has died. It transpires that Babe did not tell Sylvie about Stan's death straight away, because she wanted to attend his funeral without her. When Sylvie tries to visit the rest of the Carter family to comfort them, Babe becomes hostile and orders her to stay put. When Sylvie exclaims that no man would ever love her, Babe slaps her and she then pretends to be upset and holds her cheek in pain, leading to Babe hugging her, only for Sylvie to bite her neck as revenge for slapping her. Sylvie then tries to call the police on Babe, as she and Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell), broke the law when they lived in Ramsgate. Babe then manipulates Sylvie into not going through with it. Tina brings Sylvie to Mick and Linda's wedding, though Shirley is angry about this. When asked, Sylvie does not remember why she is there and after being told, she then mistakes Mick's eldest son Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) for Mick. In June, Sylvie is escorted to The Queen Vic by the police because she was found and would only say the name of the pub. Sylvie's social worker visits and reveals that Sylvie has made unwanted sexual advances to other residents at her care home, though the home would welcome her back. The Carters decide the home is not good enough and try to find a new one, but Sylvie is not considered a priority case, so they are forced to look after her. Linda becomes worried for the safety of her infant son Ollie Carter when Sylvie calls him a slug and threatens to pour salt on him, so Tina allows Sylvie to move in with her and her girlfriend Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), which Sonia finds difficult adapting to. After Babe is locked in the freezer at The Queen Vic, Sylvie makes a trifle and attempts to replace Babe's status in the family. Babe's memory from the attack eventually returns, and tells Mick and Linda that it was Sylvie who locked her in the freezer. After Sylvie seemingly confesses to attacking Babe and arguing with Shirley, it is revealed that Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) was the real culprit, with Babe framing Sylvie in an attempt to have her sent back to a care home. Eventually, Sonia breaks up with Tina and moves to Kettering, so Tina and Sylvie move out of the house and in with Shirley, after her relationship with Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) ends. Babe looks after Sylvie, who insults Babe, so Babe convinces her they are meeting Stan and takes her in the rain to a canal, leaving her there. Sylvie is later found and brought back home, where she is scared of Babe. Babe denies any involvement but eventually rants that she is more family than Sylvie and rants at Sylvie, saying she should have drowned. Mick ejects Babe from the pub and tells her never to return, which delights Sylvie. Soon, Tina realises Shirley is tricking Sylvie into sleeping for most of the day to avoid caring for her. Shirley admits she is struggling and Sylvie should go into care, but Tina insists she belongs with them. Tina insists on celebrating Sylvie's 75th birthday, though Shirley says she will not remember and it will be a waste of time. On Sylvie's birthday, Sylvie is unaware of what is going on and Shirley says that her dementia is getting worse. The next day, Sylvie shares a memory with Shirley and Tina about her mother being abusive towards her, leaving Shirley angry because Sylvie was abusive to her. Tina accuses Shirley of avoiding the flat and her responsibility towards Sylvie, so Shirley walks out. Shirley then decides to go to prison to solve the Carters' debt problems, and as a way to avoid caring for Sylvie. A few days later, Tina leaves Sylvie at the caf√© while she and Mick visit Shirley in prison. On their return, a confused Sylvie is attacking Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), so Tina considers care for Sylvie, which scares Sylvie. A few days later, Tina leaves Sylvie alone most of the day and when she gets home, Sylvie is in the bath and scared. Kathy realises that Tina hates the idea of someone else caring for Sylvie and makes her realise that it is what is best for Sylvie, so Tina makes a call about getting her into a care home. The day before Sylvie is due to be assessed by social services, Tina, Johnny and Whitney arrange a 1960s-themed party for her in The Queen Vic. Sylvie has a moment of clarity when some men harass Tina in the pub and she defends her daughter, but later she tells Tina, believing her to be a stranger, that she was a bad mother but never stopped loving her children, despite not knowing where they are now; Tina cries. Sylvie enjoys the party, and at the end of the night, Tina puts her to bed with a CD. Sylvie wakes in the night, confused, and runs herself a bath, taking the CD player with her, plugged into the mains. After The Queen Vic closes, the power goes out, so Tina, Johnny and Whitney investigate, and Tina is distraught to find Sylvie electrocuted in the bath.

It is set to music by Max Richter, including his mashup of \\"This Bitter Earth\\", written by Clyde Otis and sung by Dinah Washington. It premiered at the Vail International Dance Festival in Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater, Vail, Colorado, performed by Fang-Yi Sheu, Wendy Whelan, Tyler Angle and Craig Hall. The \\"This Bitter Earth\\" pas de deux is often performed separately from the rest of the piece. Production Five Movements, Three Repeats was created for the Vail International Dance Festival, and premiered there in August 2012, after an incomplete version with the same cast was danced there the previous year. The original cast includes Fang-Yi Sheu, a Taiwanese modern dancer and former Martha Graham Dance Company principal dancer, and three dancers from New York City Ballet: principal dancers Wendy Whelan, Tyler Angle, and soloist Craig Hall. The title is a reference to the use of five songs by Max Richter, and a section with all four dancers in their \\"separate zones\\" is repeated three times, including once \\"spatially reversed\\". A pas de deux originated by Whelan and Angle is set to a mashup of \\"This Bitter Earth\\", written by Clyde Otis and sung by Dinah Washington, and Richter's \\"On the Nature of Daylight\\", first used in the film Shutter Island. Sheu danced barefoot and Whelan was in pointe shoes. Revivals In September 2012, the \\"This Bitter Earth\\" pas de deux was added to New York City Ballet's repertory. The company first performed it at their fall gala, with Whelan and Angle reprising their respective roles, wearing costumes from the fashion house Valentino. The company had since revived it with other casts, donning Reid Bartelme's costumes instead. Also in September 2012, the original cast performed Five Movements, Three Repeats for the Fall for Dance Festival at the New York City Center. Sheu later performed the piece with former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater dancer Clifton Brown, and San Francisco Ballet principal dancers Yuan Yuan Tan and Damian Smith. In 2016, Vail International Dance Festival revived the \\"This Bitter Earth\\" pas de deux, danced by Isabella Boylston and Calvin Royal III, both from the American Ballet Theatre, accompanied by live vocals from Kate Davis. Videography In 2020, New York City Ballet made a one-shot film with an excerpt of the \\"This Bitter Earth\\" pas de deux, danced by Sara Mearns and Adrian Danchig-Waring. Whelan, who became the associate artistic director of the company, was present on set. The short film was originally made to promote the spring season, which was cancelled before the film was released due to the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the Vail International Dance Festival in 2020 used a digital format, and a video of the 2016 performance of the \\"This Bitter Earth\\" pas de deux with Boylston and Royal was streamed on its opening night.

Founded in 1983, the Institute is one of the largest community health centers in New York State. It serves over 85,000 patients annually at 26 locations in the Bronx, Manhattan and the mid-Hudson Valley. The Institute is a federally qualified health center (FQHC) network. Like all Community Health Centers, the Institute accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay and is governed by a board that has a majority of health center patients. The Institute offers primary care, mental health, dental care, and social work, among other services. The Institute is accredited by the Joint Commission and recognized by the National Committee for Quality Assurance as a Level 3 patient-centered medical home. The Institute also leads programs and conducts research to address racial and ethnic disparities in health, advance the use of health information technology, and improve care for diabetes, depression, women‚Äôs health, and HIV. The Institute trains health students and professionals at all levels, including the operation of three family medicine residency programs: the Beth Israel Residency Program in Urban Family Practice, the Mid-Hudson Residency in Family Practice and the Harlem Residency in Family Medicine.  History  The Institute was founded in 1984 by an interdisciplinary group comprising two family physicians, a family nurse practitioner and a behavioral scientist. Since its inception, the organization has been led by Neil Calman, MD, President and CEO. The Institute began as a small private non-profit that received federal funds to open a Faculty Development Program in Urban Primary Care, which it ran for twenty years. In 1985, it contracted with Bronx-Lebanon Hospital to re-organize its outpatient department into a family practice center, and initiated its first residency training program in family medicine. It worked with Bronx Lebanon until 1999, and jointly developed several small community-based medical practices. In 1986, the Institute acquired the Sidney Hillman Health Center in Union Square from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and turned the-multi-specialty practice into a family practice. In 1994, the Institute developed a relationship with Beth Israel Medical Center, and began the Beth Israel Residency in Urban Family Practice, opening the Phillips Family Practice to serve as the ambulatory care training site for those residents. Simultaneously, the Institute was building and opening a series of small family practice sites. Between 1991 through 1998, the Institute opened the Parkchester Family Practice, Walton Family Health Center, Urban Horizons Family Health Center, East 13th Street Family Practice, and the Mount Hope Family Practice. In 1999, the Institute received an award from the Centers for Disease Control to initiate Bronx Health REACH, a consortium of community and faith based organizations committed to the elimination of racial disparities in health in the South Bronx. The group addresses issues related to nutrition and fitness education; access to healthy foods and safe places to exercise; diabetes maintenance and prevention; school food and exercise programs; and the segregation of health care in academic medical centers. In 2007, the Institute was named a Center of Excellence in the Elimination of Disparities. In 2000, the Institute implemented a system-wide electronic health record and practice management system, Epic. The system has altered the way care is delivered by allowing for increased care coordination and preventive care. The EHR also enables research in health processes and outcomes, and has permitted the Institute to participate in a number of federal and state payment initiatives such as Primary Care Medical Homes and achieve Meaningful Use designation. In 2006, the Institute assumed responsibility for three practices operated by St. Christopher‚Äôs, Inc. As a result, it obtained Article 31 licensure to operate two community mental health programs in the Bronx. A year later, the Institute acquired six health centers and the Mid Hudson Family Practice Residency Program in the Mid-Hudson Valley, which doubled the organizational budget, the number of staff, and the number of patients served. In 2010, when North General Hospital in East Harlem closed, the Institute opened a community health center on the first floor of the former hospital. Two years later, the Institute moved this practice to the newly built Family Health Center of Harlem, two blocks away, which serves as the home of its third residency program, the Harlem Residency in Family Medicine. In 2012, the Institute opened the Stevenson Family Health Center in the Soundview section of the Bronx, preserving access to care as well as jobs in this underserved and geographically isolated community.  Current Activities  = Mission = The mission of the Institute for Family Health is to \\"improve access to high quality, patient-centered primary health care targeted to the needs of medically underserved communities.\\" = Health Services = The Institute accepts most private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients without insurance. Services provided by the Institute for Family Health include: primary care, sexual and reproductive health, behavioral health, dental care, women‚Äôs health, prenatal care and delivery, health care for teens, diabetes care, HIV care, some specialty care, home visit services, WIC, Veterans services, free clinics, homeless health care, school-based health care, insurance enrollment, and social services. Patients can obtain a wide variety of free or low-cost sexual and reproductive health services at all Institute sites.

Airfield An airstrip was built on 320 acres east of Papeton, CO, around 1920. The land was owned by the Colorado Springs Company, and the airstrip was built by Winfield E. Bowersox, who learned to fly and attained his pilot's license in 1913 from the Wright Aviation School. The airstrip and a few buildings was about four blocks from the end of the street car line, between Papeton and Hwy 85/87 (now Nevada).[15][c]s. The Alexander Film Company moved their aircraft manufacturing plant from Denver to Colorado Springs in 1931, just off Nevada Ave between Peakview and Roswell, CO. The field became known as Nichols Field or Alexander Field, by May 1926. A building was labeled \\"Pan American Airways\\". The city's first air-mail service began at Nichols Field in 1927. Alexander Airport Alexander Aircraft Company moved their aircraft manufacturing facilities from Denver to Colorado Springs, where they would build larger facilities to build their biplanes for civilian use. In 1931, the Department of Commerce described the airport to be on with an oiled runway on a minor slope. There were airplane servicing facilities and two hangars at the airport. There was a mine and windmill north of the airport, and a water tower with an obstruction light to the west. In 1928 the Pikes Peak Flying school began at the airport, and was sold by Henry Chase Stone the following year. In 1929, Pikes Peak Air Commerce, Inc. operated what Ralph N. Miller described as \\"possibly the highest flying school in America today\\" at Alexander Airport. Planes flying in and out of the airport at in altitude, Miller stated, were 80% as efficient as planes and have harder landings than planes operating at sea level because of the thinner mountain air. This can make for a more careful, conservative pilot. A group of Boy Scouts formed the unique Eaglerock Glider troop in January 1930 to build and fly a glider at the Alexander Airport. Beginning in June 1930, 20 troop members took turns flying the Alexander glider, with more than 300 flights by December 1931. Aircraft Mechanics In 1937, Aircraft Mechanics, Incorporated (AMI), founded by former employees of Alexander Aircraft Company, bought the airfield and manufacturing plant. They restored and repaired airplanes, including Alexander Eaglerocks, and during World War II, build exhaust manifolds and engine mounts. They then built seats for aircraft, including Air Force aircraft ejection seats and crew seats for commercial aircraft and the Space Shuttle. Nichols Field By 1946, the airstrip was called Nichols Field, where Pikes Peak Air Commerce, Inc. continued to do business. Two crossing runways were added by 1947. By 1961, the former airfield was covered with structures.

It was a pact between Charles T. Metcalfe and Maharaja Ranjit Singhhttps://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Amritsar. Ranjit Singh (1780-1839) was a Sikh warrior who had been establishing a kingdom in what was at that time northern India. He had established a capital at Lahore in 1799 when he defeated Zaman Shah, an Afghan leader, and this emphasised his status among the Sikhs. He proclaimed himself maharajah of the Punjab in 1801 and expanded his territories to such an extent that by 1808 he had control of an area bounded by Gujarat, Ludhiana and Multan. He had Malwa, on the south side of the Sutlej river, as his next target but the Sikh chiefs in that area appealed to the British for protection. The protection was forthcoming and the British, who until recently had been occupied in Hindustan obtaining victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, attempted to resolve the issue using diplomacy. This failed, Singh invaded Malwa in September 1808 and in February 1809 the British successfully attacked Singh's forces there. Realising his relative military weakness, Singh conceded with the Treaty of Amritsar. They promised that they will not interfere his affairs . Although the terms of the treaty prevented Singh from any further territorial expansion south of the Sutlej, they also permitted him complete freedom of action to the north of it. This enabled him to extract tribute from less powerful chieftains, including Jats and other Sikhs, and ultimately to gain control of areas such as Peshawar and Kashmir. The unification of these territories, which was aided by him Westernising his armies, formed the Sikh empire that last until British subjugation in 1849.

The story is set in the early 10th century in Anglo-Saxon Mercia and Northumbria. Ten years of relative peace have passed since Alfred died. That is long enough for the Danes. Saxon warlord Uhtred of Bebbanburg tries again to gain his own inheritance and again fights for the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, now with his grown son as part of his warrior band. Plot summary There have been ten years of relative peace on the island of Britain between the Saxons and the Danes. Uhtred disowns his elder son Uhtred because he has just taken vows to become a Christian priest. He renames his elder son Father Judas, and then bestows the name Uhtred on his younger, 19-year-old son Osbert. Abbot Wihtred strikes Uhtred in anger, whereupon Uhtred grabs a staff and unintentionally kills him. As a result, nearly all of Uhtred's Christian warriors leave him. Aethelflaed, Queen of Mercia and Uhtred's lover, takes these men into her service. Reaching home, Uhtred discovers that Cnut Longsword burned down his hall because he mistakenly believed Uhtred had taken his wife and children. He manages to convince Cnut that he is innocent. Returning home, Uhtred finds all his outbuildings burnt, this time by Bishop Wulfheard. He has nothing to rebuild and a shrunken force. He decides to try to reclaim his inheritance, the fortress at Bebbanburg in Northumbria, held by his uncle Aelfric. Aelfric stole the fortress from Uhtred after Uhtred's father was killed by the Danes forty years earlier. His uncle had tried and failed to kill Uhtred; then he had him sold into slavery. They kill some of his uncle's men and succeed in entering through the first gate, masquerading as the dead men, but are detected too soon, trapped and outnumbered. While Uhtred confronts his cousin, also named Uhtred, Finan, Untred's second in command, takes captive the uncle, cousin Uhtred's wife Ingulfrid and her 11-year-old son (also named Uhtred). Uhtred kills his uncle and uses the wife and son of his cousin as hostages to leave. They sail to Frisia to rest and refit. Uhtred figures out that Cnut is readying for war, after ten years of relative peace. Cnut's wife and children had not been kidnapped; it was part of Cnut's ruse to persuade Aethelred, Aethelflaed‚Äôs despised husband, into believing that Cnut would be preoccupied with an enemy, encouraging Aethelred to attack East Anglia, a Danish-held area that is also Christian. Cnut then invades Mercia. Uhtred sails to the east coast of Britain. He proceeds to Bearddan Igge (Bardney Abbey), where the Mercians have been searching for some of the bones of St. Oswald. Mercian priests say that if all of Oswald's bones can be brought back together, it will be a sign that Wessex and Mercia can defeat the Danes. Uhtred plants an anonymous partial skeleton for them to find. Uhtred takes his men to Ceaster (Chester) and defeats the men guarding Cnut's family. He captures Cnut's wife and two children. When the children see a priest, they mistakenly greet him as Uncle (Abbot) Wihtred, so Uhtred realizes the abbot he killed was Cnut's man. Uhtred threatens to kill his captives to force a Danish force to raise its siege of Glaewecestre (Gloucester). Inside Glaewecestre, he finds Osferth, Aethelflaed, and the bishop who burned Uhtred's barns. Uhtred sets fire to all of Cnut's boats but one, which Osferth takes to reach King Edward. Uhtred buys time by tricking Cnut into believing that he killed Cnut's daughter. Enraged, Cnut pursues Uhtred and his greatly outnumbered band. Uhtred hopes that the time Cnut wastes will enable Edward to bring his army. At Teotanheale (Tettenhall), Uhtred awaits Cnut's attack. Before the battle, Uhtred gives Cnut his wife and daughter back, keeping the son. Although Uhtred uses his wiles to kill some of Cnut's men (despite being grossly outnumbered), he is on the verge of defeat when Father Judas, his disowned son, brings Father Pyrlig and a few hundred Welsh warriors to reinforce him. Then Cnut and Uhtred fight. Uhtred injures Cnut, but Cnut is carried away by his men. Uhtred's son slays Cnut's main ally, Sigurd Thorsen. Then King Edward arrives with his men and the Mercians. The Danes break and the Saxons have the victory. Word is that Aethelred was badly wounded, but still lives. Cnut comes back for a one-on-one fight with Uhtred. Uhtred kills Cnut, though he is grievously wounded himself, nearly to the point of death. But he lives.

The big set pieces are more impressive than the realistically meandering odyssey that threads them together. The most consistent motif is Uhtred‚Äôs undying and principled hostility to ‚Äúthe nailed god‚Äù of Christianity and the threat he represents to the warrior code Uhtred so perfectly embodies.\\" Publishers Weekly finds that Cornwell brings an important era in British history to light: > In Cornwell's (1356) latest, 10th century Britain is a splintered land, > populated by pagans and Christians and divided between Saxons and Danes.

Historical accuracy The historical basis for the fictional tale rests on the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which recorded a great battle between the Angles and the Danes at Teotanheale (Tettenhall) In the year 910. The victory was to the Angles, with an army composed of men from Wessex and Mercia. Two Danish leaders were killed in the battle, Eowils and Healfdan, whose roles were taken by the fictional Danes already part of Uhtred's life. No details of the battle were recorded other than these, so the progress of it is fictional. The River Tame flowed near Tettenhall then. It is true that Mercians travelled to Northumbria in search of Saint Oswald's bones, found them and interred them in Gloucester, minus the skull (claimed by many, perhaps at Durham) and the arm kept at Bebbanburg (Bamburgh). This is not the last battle between the Angles or Saxons and the Danes, but it was a decisive victory. The system of burhs for defence started by King Alfred to keep Wessex safe expands in the territories his son gains in battle.

A few species reach southeastern Asia. There are 322 species as of April 2019. Biology Lamprophiids are a very diverse group of snakes. Many are terrestrial but some are fossorial (e.g. Amblyodipsas), arboreal (e.g. Langaha), or semi-aquatic (e.g. Lycodonomorphus). Some are fast-moving (e.g. Psammophis) whereas others are slow (e.g. Duberria). They are found in deserts, grasslands, temperate and tropical forests, steppes and mountains. Together they feed on mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. Some species use constriction to subdue their prey (e.g. Boaedon), whereas others are highly venomous and dangerous to humans (e.g. Atractaspis). Tooth morphology within Lamprophiidae is probably more variable than within any other snake family. Most species are oviparous. Classification Most lamprophiids were historically considered to be members of the subfamily Lamprophiinae in the family Colubridae. The following classification follows Pyron et al., 2010,Pyron RA, Burbrink FT, Colli GR, Montes de Oca AN, Vitt LJ, Kuczynski CA, Wiens JJ. 2010. The phylogeny of advanced snakes (Colubroidea), with discovery of a new subfamily and comparison of support methods for likelihood trees. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 58: 329‚Äì342. whose finding that lamprophiids are more closely related to elapids has been repeated by several other studies. Together these two groups are sometimes referred to as the Elapoidea. In fact, some studies have found that Elapidae is nested within Lamprophiidae, a finding that, if confirmed, will likely necessitate taxonomic changes to restore monophyly within the Elapoidea.

In his 70s, he left entertainment and started a psychotherapy clinic called the Center For Human Problems and was accused of practicing psychotherapy without a license in a cultish environment.http://www.paulmorantz.com/cult/escape-from-center-for-human- problems/ Early years Kennedy was born Samuel Richard Solomonick either July 23, 1904 in Chicago, Illinois, c. 1906 in RussiaNew York, State Census, 1915 or in the East Bronx in 1911.p.30 Garrow Raised in the Bronx, he was the son of Isidor Solomonick (died 1974) and Erna E.

Solomonick held a wide variety of jobs including running a cinema in the Bronx, working on a farm in Kansas, a bricklayer, longshoreman, wrangler, farmer, bricklayer, painter, printer and even nightclub singer. His job in a print shop lead him to join the trade union and he became an officer of an Industrial Printing Employees Union. An excellent speaker, Solomonick was drawn to left wing causes notably the American League Against War and Fascism later changing its name to the American League for Peace and Democracy and the People's Committee Against William Randolph Hearst. Solomonick then became a circulation manager of The Daily Worker the newspaper published by the Communist Party USA. Solomonick became an anti-communist with the signing of the 1939 Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Finding himself unemployed and possibly unemployable due to his anti-communism, Solomonick conferred with his friend Andrew Loewi, whose family owned the Park Management Corporation, and Solomonick decided on changing his name upon seeing a sign reading \\"Kennedy\\".

After the war ended in 1945 Kennedy was employed by the United States Department of the Treasury. He approached Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. and the Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J. Anslinger that he tell the story of the Bureau's international work in cooperation with the United States Customs Service, United States Coast Guard and the Treasury with the understanding that the essential facts remain in focus. Kennedy and Sidney Buchman formed their own film company in Hollywood where he wrote and was credited as associate producer of To the Ends of the Earth a thriller about the international activities of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Due to the cooperation of the United States Government, the Motion Picture Production Code Motion Picture Production Code was amended to allow for the screen portrayal of the worldwide effort to curb the illicit traffic in narcotics.Kennedy, Jay Richard An Approach to Pictures The Screen Writer June 1947 A planned film on the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt was never made.

In the 1970s, he studied psychotherapy and opened Center for Human Problems Inc. in Tarzana. Patients and a former therapist at the Center claimed Kennedy did not believe licenses to practice psychotherapy were necessary but withheld the lack of licenses of some of the providers from the patients. They claimed under Kennedy's direction patients were taught they could never leave because they would become worse than when they had started and remaining was necessary to continually evolve and live to be over 100. They claimed Kennedy said he was going to live to be 150. Patients claimed they were told to donate monies, in one case even sell business to do so, to make sure the Center could pay its bills and so Kennedy could write a book on how to save mankind. The therapy, it was claimed, would prevent sickness. The theory included parents, they claimed were the cause of all illness, and to be well a person should disconnect from his/her parents. Paul Morantz, an attorney specialist in cults and brainwashing cases, sued on the half of 2 former patients in a case that was settled in 1990. The health Department investigated and a center was closed not long before Kennedy's death. Kennedy died of heart failure on October 14, 1991 in Westlake, Los Angeles.

Recently elected to the Academy of Arts and Sciences (Writers Division) 2020. Born to a Jordanian father and Palestinian mother, she began her career making commercials and has worked in both documentary and fiction since 1999. Her debut feature film Pomegranates and Myrrh picked up 10 international awards, sold worldwide and was released theatrically and screened at over 80 international festivals. Najjar's first fictional film, Pomegranates and Myrrh, features a young Palestinian dancer who defends her family's land after her husband is sent to an Israeli prison. According to Najjar, when the film was first screened in Ramallah there was public outcry by the Hamas Government in Gaza over the film's portrayal of \\"what was deemed its 'unpatriotic' portrayal of an untrustworthy wife of a political prisoner.\\" At the Doha Tribeca Film Festival, the film won the Best Arab Film award. Her second film Eyes of a Thief also is a multi-award-winning thriller based on a true story, and shot entirely in Palestinian Territories. with Egyptian multi-award-winning star actor and producer Khaled Abol Naga as the lead and the Algerian sensational singer Souad Massi debut as an actress, Eyes of a Thief was the official Palestinian submission to the 2014 87th Academy Awards (The Oscars).Eyes of A Thief, a Palestinian/Algerian/French/Icelandic co-production which received the support of Sundance Scriptwriting Lab, Sundance Duke Award, Dubai Film Connection, Jordan Film Fund and was a participant in the Rome International film Festival New Cinema Network. Her third feature film, a road trip: Between Heaven and Earth completed in November 2019 played at the Cairo International Film Festival international competition, and won the Naguib Mahfouz Best Screenplay award. The film lined up to play at several international prestigious film festivals was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Najjar's work includes several award-winning films also shown worldwide; Yasmine Tughani (2006), Naim and Wadee‚Äôa (1999), Quintessence of Oblivion (2000), Blue Gold (2004), A Boy Called Mohamad (2002), and They Came from the East which opened the 2004 European Academy Awards. Najjar produced a collection of short films by international filmmakers Gaza Winter (2009). The 1999 documentary film Naim and Wadee‚Äôa was based on Najjar's family and includes the oral histories of Na‚Äôim Azar and Wadee‚Äôa Aghabi, a couple who were forced to leave their Jaffa home in 1948. The film won the Award for Films of Conflict and Resolution at the 2000 Hamptons International Film Festival. A speaker on numerous panels on cinema and a member of International Film Festival Juries, Najjar has also reviewed books, and her articles on Palestinian cinema have been published. She was an advisor and reader for the Rawi Sundance Lab for Arab scriptwriters, and organized seminars for Palestinian filmmakers, and recently gave a Directors Masterclass in Galway International Film Festival. Najjar lives in the Palestinian Territories.  Early life  Her fragmented past was pieced together with stories, accompanied by the pictures that her maternal grandparents hurriedly tucked away when they were forced to leave Palestine in 1948. It was those pictures seen and stories told years later by her parents that made up her first taste of a country. A camera given to her by her father, a Jordanian who was living in Jerusalem, journalist at one point in his life, and also forced to leave in 1948 ... and the music her mother loved, which filled the house which became her tools for expression. At university in the US, she was confronted with horrific stereotypes of herself and Palestinians, and a media determined not to see Arabs otherwise. She realised being annoyed wouldn't make a difference. Armed with a MA/Cinema, she went back to the center of the conflict. Now living in a No Man‚Äôs Land between Ramallah and Jerusalem inside the 450-km Israeli Wall surrounded by havoc and destruction, she blinded herself to a situation worsening daily with no hope in sight, and opened her eyes to the possibilities that lie in cinema. With over 10 award-winning films including Palestinian nomination 2015 Oscars Best Foreign Film/ Golden Globe Awards, she has learnt that films allow people to dream the same dream, feel emotions and fill empty spaces together ‚Äì and ultimately have hope. She worked to promote that hope, and advise other Arab filmmakers by first being a Reader and then an Advisor for the Rawi Sundance Screenwriters Lab. And by bringing in Egyptian and Algerian superstars to Palestinian land, and a first on its screen, broke new ground for filmmakers and proved further shared commonalities across borders, passports, flags and show the power of cinema. This was not the first time she has opened doors as all her films including Pomegranates and Myrrh and Eyes of a Thief have all been completely shot in the Palestinian Territory defying the restrictions by bringing in Palestinians from all over the country, and those in diaspora to work on her set, while making sure the crew is equally divided male/females. Representing Palestine at all the major international film festivals by one film or another, or on the Jury of these festivals has further highlighted the narratives that need to be told by the people living in the country. While another untested ground was explored in her recent feature Between Heaven and Earth, cinema is just a part of her life and passions. Family especially, and friends, travel, arts & books, sports... adventures to the unknown, getting lost, cooking different foods, meeting new people are all the good things in life for her. Najjar has a BA in Political Science/Economics and earned her MA in Film in Washington, DC.

It is also Regional Route 15 of the National Cycle Network. From Reculver (going clock-wise), the trail passes through Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate to reach Pegwell Bay, where Vikings first landed in Kent. The Trail then, uses an inland route on quiet lanes (except the short section beside the A299), passing through a couple of villages with ancient churches including Minster-in-Thanet Abbey and St Nicholas at Wade, to return to Reculver. History The trail was devised by a collaboration of Douglas Bush (the Thanet representative for cycling tour club Right To Cycle, the local secretary of the Thanet Cycle Forum and a member of the East Kent cycle campaign group Spokes), Sustrans (British charity to promote sustainable transport) and Thanet District Council. Olympic athlete Kelly Holmes MBE opened the Trail, on Sunday 10 June 2001. Total cost of the trail (including design, construction and marketing) is about ¬£500,000 divided roughly equally between Kent County Council and Thanet District Council. Route It is largely traffic free (especially along the coast). On-road 46% - Off-road 54% . The coastal route also follows (in most sections) the route of the Saxon Shore Way (long distance footpath). But the inland section of the trail is still being upgraded and improved, such as the section between the A299 Thanet Way and Reculver. At Sandwich it connects to National Cycle Route 1 to head to Canterbury. At Reculver, the trail links to Wantsum Walk to Upstreet (following an old river route) and Oyster Bay Trail (leading to Whitstable, along the coastline). Viking Coastal Trail at Herne Bay (National Cycle Network 15) The Trail forms the route for many charity local cycle rides, including Thanet Road Runner mountain bike duathlon, which starts as a short 2.4-mile road run from Minnis Bay and continues with nine miles of cycling before another run of 4.5 miles. It is also used by the British Heart Foundation for its annual Viking Bike Ride. Usage Canterbury Christ Church University College studied the economic impact of the Viking Coastal Trail in 2003. 364 cyclists were interviewed between May and August. They concluded that the overall economic impact of the Trail equates to around ¬£293,297 per year. The Trail is Kent‚Äôs No. 1 cycle route. Used by at Ramsgate ‚Äì 27,965, Westgate ‚Äì 39,616 cyclists in 2003 during June and August.

On that day a sheriff and his deputies burned down the band's village at the behest of a local land developer who claimed to have purchased the village land parcels for back taxes. The event has been since labeled: \\"A Bitter Memory,\\" \\"A Shameful Past,\\" or \\"Legalized Arson.\\" Professional research by Richard White, Stanford University, George Cornell, Michigan State University, and Alice Littlefied, Central Michigan University, has shown that it was all of these things and was allowed to happen as a result of the state and federal government officials' inclination to either misinterpret, forget, or deny the written treaty language of the 1830s and 1850s, in the agreements between Washington, D.C and the Michigan-based Burt Lake Band of Ottawa Indians.  Background  The Tip of the Mitt area of northern Michigan has been categorized by Charles Cleland at Michigan State University as a \\"prehistoric crossroads\\", an avenue of travel by water beginning at the Straits of Mackinac, southwest along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, and south to Grand Traverse Bay. This waterway was used by Native Americans as far back as 10,000 years and was the centerpiece of the Woodland Indian \\"canoe culture\\" beginning in the mid 1600s. The Ottawa (Odawa) bands of Indians used as their base, what Cleland refers to as, the \\"Grand Traverse Corridor.\\" It was the area of origin for the many trade goods they canoed to other Great Lakes-based Indians of the Upper Mid-West Region. The Ottawa were farmers, fishermen and hunters, as well as gatherers, who used the warm months of the year to inhabit various Lake Michigan and inland lake shorelines of the Tip of the Mitt area in lower northern Michigan. It was here that they procured the goods that would later be traded. Unlike the political organization found to exist within Native American societies in other areas of North America, the Ottawa (Odawa) and fellow Chippewa (Ojibwa) people of northern Michigan existed as separate small bands of Indians, some migrating with the change in weather, others living in small (100‚Äì200 people) fixed villages. The small Ottawa-Chippewa village along the western shoreline of the inland lake once referred to as Lake Cheboigan, and later, Burt Lake, had its beginnings sometime in the mid to later 1600s. By 1850, the Cheboigan Band of Ottawa and Chippewa at this site on Burt Lake had their home referred to as Indian Village. The federal government treaties signed by representative of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa in Washington -1836, and Detroit-1855 (1856), both declared the area of the Indian Village (375 acres) on the Cheboigan (Burt Lake) to be regarded as an \\"Indian Preserve\\" or reservation. That was the INTENT of both documents and that fact was passed down from generation to generation by the \\"Oral Tradition\\" of the band's elders. When signed, the literacy of the Burt Lake Band signers was such that only a mark was placed on the document, but that was a mark of faith, one that meant there was trust in what was said (what was intended) and agreed to (in 1836 and again in 1855) The treaty language was thought by the Native signers to be in perpetuity; however, that did not happen. The area of Indian Point on Burt Lake's western shore has been shown by archaeologists to possess pottery fragments that date back over 500 years. Soil samples reveal that the existence of charcoal deposits existing in the same area due to periodic fires being set to help clear the land for cultivation. These fires were set by Native people historians refer to as the \\"Chaboiganing Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians,\\" and today referred to as the Burt Lake Band. This land area of the Burt Lake Band was approximately 20 miles inland, due south of the Michigan's Straits of Mackinac, an area of water separating Lake Michigan to the west from Lake Huron to the east. The Burt Lake Band's Indian Point was located on a peninsula of land in Burt Lake that was part of the \\"Inland Waterway Route.\\" It had been used for centuries by Native people for transportation, and then later by summer tourists for travel throughout the area's interconnecting rives and lakes.  The Act  On Monday, October 15, 1900, during the morning hours, a contingent of white men from the Cheboygan, Michigan area came to the small settlement on Indian Point, called Indian Village. They came to remove the inhabitants from their homes and fields. All who lived there were of Ottawa or Chippewa blood and were members of the Burt Lake Band of Indians.Department of Justice File No. 15812. Burt Lake Band of Indians. Leading the group of men was Cheboygan lumberman, banker, and land speculator John Walter McGinn. He had a two-year-old \\"writ of assistance\\" issued in 1898 by Circuit Court Judge Oscar Adams. McGinn had summoned the county sheriff, Fred Ming and his deputies to remove all villagers from the land he now claimed to own through his purchases of (supposed delinquent) \\"tax titles.\\" Ming and his deputies sat the household possessions of the nineteen families in front of their cabin homes and one by one, McGinn set fire to the houses. Only the St. Mary's Catholic Mission Church built in 1838 with aid from Bishop Frederic Baraga survived. It later became the Ming pig barn when he later built his farm on the nineteen evictee's property. Following the October \\"Burn-Out\\" by McGinn, many of the families moved in with Burt Lake Band members who lived close by on Indian Trail road, just north of Indian Village. Others took up residence further to the west in Middle or Cross village. As time progressed, the Burn-Out families built new homes on the land owned by the Massey and Nongueskwa families along Indian Trail (today it is Indian Road). This area then became known as Indianville. In 1908, a second St. Mary's Catholic Church was built there and remains active today. In 1911, the United States Attorney General, on behalf of the Burt Lake Band, instigated legal action against John W. McGinn in the Eastern District Court of Michigan- Bay City, Michigan. A \\"Bill of Complaint\\" was filed on June 22, 1911 by Frank H. Watson, District Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan asking that the land expropriated by McGinn in 1900 be returned to its nineteen owners. The federal government's cases hinged on the premise that: \\"all the deeds and attempted conveyances made by the persons named as grantees in the deeds... and the petition for a Writ of Assistance used by McGinn to force the assistance of the Cheboygan County Sheriff were wholly null and void.Department of Justice File No. 158012. Burt Lake Band. It was the federal government's claim that the Burt Lake Band had been granted the Indian Village area land by treaty and should not have been evicted for non-payment of property taxes. Burt Township, Cheboygan County and the State of Michigan had errored in assessing the federally recognized Burt Lake Band's Indian Village property. Added to that was the fact that at no time did the Governor of Michigan, whose name in perpetuity was on the six in question land deeds, receive notice of a property tax assessment on the lands (which all had been placed in trust to his office). Nor did the Governor received any legal notice that the six land deeds in question were delinquent in any wrongly assessed property taxes.  Consequences  The first sovereign nations the newly created United States of America dealt with was the North American-based \\"Indigenous People\\" who had arrived first in the New World. The 1789 adopted United States Constitution followed the established European tradition begun by the French in North America of dealing with the Native People encountered in the new country as separate and sovereign nations. Article 1, Section 8 of this document stated: \\"The Congress shall have power to- regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\\" Article VI then stated: > This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in > Pursuance thereof; and ALL TREATIES made, or which shall be made, under the > Authority of the United States, shall be the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND; and > the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the > Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. The Territory of Michigan was organized as part of the Northwest Ordinance of 1789, one of the first acts signed by President George Washington under the newly ratified United States Constitution. In fact, the Congress of the United States reaffirmed the Northwest Ordinance under the Constitution meaning it could not later be repealed. Section 14, Article 3 stated: > The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their > lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent; > and, in their property, rights, and liberty, they shall never be invaded or > disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws > founded in justice and humanity, shall from time to time be made for > preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace and > friendship with them. A few years later the Treaty of Greenville was signed in 1795, Article 5 of this treaty stated: > To prevent any misunderstanding about the Indian lands relinquished by the > United States in the fourth article, it is now explicitly declared, that the > meaning of that relinquishment is this: the Indian tribes who have a right > to those lands, are quietly to enjoy them, hunting, planting, and dwelling > thereon, so long as they please, without any molestation from the United > States; but when those tribes, or any of them, shall be disposed to sell > their lands, or any part of them, they are to be sold only to the United > States; and until such sale, the United States will protect all the said > Indian tribes in the quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of > the United States, and against all other white persons who intrude upon the > same. And the said Indian tribes again acknowledge themselves to be under > the protection of the said United States, and no other power whatever. For many years before and after the arrival of Europeans in the area of Mackinac Island (1640s) located in the upper region of the lower peninsula of Michigan, the Ottawa and Chippewa people of the area existed in small villages of 100 to 200 people. These villages were politically organized not as one tribe of people in the area of Michigan but rather as small individual bands of Ottawa or of Chippewa. Many of these were migrating bands who would come to northern Michigan for the summer months to fish and gather. The group of Ottawa and some Chippewa people who gathered along the western shoreline of the large inland body of water first known as Cheboigan Lake began to make a permanent village there by the early 1800s. They girdled the large trees and burned the area to clear the land, planting corn, beans and squash. They fished the inland lake, hunted, gathered maple syrup, and lived a life rather isolated from other Native people of the north. By the 1830s, they were known to the federal government as the Cheboigan Lake or Sheboygan band of Ottawa Indians. Their small village became known as Indian Village and was located on a peninsula that jutted out into Cheboigan Lake (later to be called Burt Lake). This location in the center of the Tip of the Mitt's \\"inland waterway\\" extending from Lake Michigan northeast to Lake Huron made the village a key spot in the avenue of trade for the Ottawa People. Its remoteness made it one of the last areas to be visited by the officials of the new American government in Washington D.C. The Mackinac Indian Agency of Mackinac Island was the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington D.C.'s official representative to the many Native people of the northern Michigan area. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Mackinac Agency in 1836 was Henry Schoolcraft. The government's Indian policy at the time was one of removal of all Native people to the west of the Mississippi. Schoolcraft (married to a Native woman) was somewhat sympathetic to the desire of the Michigan Native people to remain in their historic homeland. He was instrumental in helping accomplish the Treaty of Washington signed in the summer of 1836. The treaty ceded to the United States a vast territory of more than 13 million acres or about one-third of the present state of Michigan. It was then a territory and thought to be worth many millions of dollars (mostly its timber). Schoolcraft believed that the Ottawa and Ojibwe (Chippewa) people would be better off learning subsistence farming, and that meant giving up their widespread hunting lands. At that time, the Ottawa and Chippewa people of the Michigan Territory knew that they needed to deal with the federal government since there was an ever-increasing number of white settlers encroaching upon their hunting lands. They also recognized their growing reliance on manufactured goods as a result of their relationship with the fur trading companies they had long dealt with. This relationship had placed them in great debt to the various fur companies. The system of the \\"company store\\" was such that when the fur trade began to dwindle in the early 1830s, the Native people had less and less ability to repay for goods they had grown fond of possessing and had bought on credit. In the summer of 1836 the Treaty of Washington was agreed to by United States government's chosen Ottawa and Chippewa representatives in the nation's capitol. For the land ceded (almost one-third of present Michigan) Article 2 of the treaty stated: > One tract of fifty thousand acres to be located on Little Traverse bay: one > tract of twenty thousand acres to be located on the north shore of Grand > Traverse bay,... one tract of one thousand acres to be located by > Chingassanoo,‚Äîor the Big Sail, on the Cheboigan.Treaty of Washington, 1836. > Treaty with the Ottawa & Chippewa Nations. This meant each band of Ottawa or Ottawa & Chippewa were to receive land preserved for their use. In addition, Article 4 stated: > In consideration of the foregoing cessions, the United States engage to pay > to the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations, the following sums, namely: 1st- An > annuity of thirty thousand dollars per annum, in specie, for twenty years; > eighteen thousand dollars, to be paid to the Indians between Grand River and > the Cheboigan.... Different Article 2 language was then added by the United States Senate before ratifying it. This happened after it had been signed by the Ottawa and Chippewa representatives. It read: > From the cession aforesaid the tribes reserve for their own use, to be held > in common the following tracts for the term of five years from the date of > the ratification of this treaty, and no longer; unless the United States > shall grant them permission to remain on said lands for a longer period...\\" > This change in language which brought the idea of removal to the west caused > the Cheboigan Lake band of Ottawa to devise a strategy for survival in > Michigan. Taking the advice of the Mackinac Agency Indian agent assigned to the Cheboigan band, the villagers decided to pool their annuity monies to buy the land parcels which they had turned from forest into farms and a small village. On February 1, 1848 the first of six separate land patents were purchased by the \\"Sheboygan Band of Indians of whom Kie-she-go-way is Chief.\\" This was Certificate No 6293 and encompassed 71 acres of what would be a total of 375 purchased acres. The last of the six parcels was purchased on April 1, 1850 and was Certificate No. 7095. It was signed by then President Zachary Taylor. The first certificate was signed by President James Polk. All six land patent certificates contained the wording: > ...the United States of America...has given and granted unto the said > Governor of Michigan and his successors in trust...the said tract above > described to have and to hold in trust for the Sheboygan Indians forever. The oral tradition of the Ottawa People never forgot this wording and the wording of the 1836 and 1855 treaties along with the true intent of what all these paper legal documents meant. The land at Indian Village, on Indian point, along the shoreline of Burt Lake in Cheboygan County, Michigan was to be theirs forever. It was given to them as part of the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. On top of that, it had been outright purchased with their 1836 federal treaty annuity money between February 1848 and April 1850. The wording of the July 31, 1855 Treaty of Detroit began with: > In view of the existing condition of the Ottawas and Chippewas, and of their > legal and equitable claims against the United States, it is agreed between > the contracting parties as follows: > Article 1. > The United States will withdraw from sale for the benefit of said > Indians...Seventh. For the Cheboygan band, townships 35 and 36 north, range > 3 west.Treaty of Detroit, 1855. Treaty with the Ottawa & Chippewa Indians of > Michigan. These two townships were exactly where the Burt Lake (Cheboigan Lake) Band of Ottawa had their Indian Village settlement and their cultivated fields. All was within the parcels of land they had purchased between 1848 and 1850- a total of 375 acres. The wording of Article 5 was asked for by the Ottawa and Chippewa heads of the various \\"bands\\" or groups of Indians to make sure to the government officials that from the signing date of July 31, 1855 on, the federal officials would recognize and understand the actual political organization (units) of the various Michigan Indians. Unlike other parts of the United States, Michigan Indians organized themselves by \\"bands,\\" not \\"tribes. In 1836 these various \\"bands\\" were misnamed by government officials as being \\"Ottawa and Chippewa Tribes.\\" This was done strictly for the convenience of the federal government in making the treaty negotiations go easier. But, it was a false labeling and the signers of the 1855 Treaty specifically asked that it be changed for posterity. ARTICLE 5 read: > The tribal organization of said Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, except so far > as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions > of this agreement, is hereby dissolved; and if at any time hereafter, > further negotiations with the United States, in reference to any matters > contained herein, should become necessary, no general convention of the > Indians shall be called; but such as reside in the vicinity of any usual > place of payment,... The Burt Lake Band was so adamant about this wording and the fact that they wanted to be sure their 1836 Treaty granted land and that their 1848-1850 purchased land would be protected that they did not sign the 1855 Treaty until the summer of 1856‚Äîone year later. However, even with all the precautions taken, the Indian Village on Indian Point was destroyed on October 15, 1900. The wording of Article 5, put there by the federal government treaty negotiators at the request of the Ottawa and Chippewa headmen (chiefs) in July 1855 actually ended up having the exact opposite effect. The two Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioners George W. Manypenny, and Henry C. Gilbert were both out of office by the end of 1857. Their INTENT of the meaning behind the Article 5 language seemed to go with them since the Bureau of Indian Affairs later had trouble interpreting Article 5. Article 5 in the 1855 Treaty of Detroit was never meant to convey that the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan were to no longer exist as a political unit. It meant to correct the 1836 Treaty language defect which referred to the Ottawa and Chippewa \\"bands\\"' of Indians as each one tribe. This had never been and was only the artificial creation of federal officials to facilitate a quicker negotiation of the 1836 treaty. In 1855, the precedent (though wrong) from 1836 was kept and the federal Commissioner for Indian Affairs Henry Gilbert used the terms Ottawa and Chippewa Tribe in the treaty document. The fifth article was meant to set the record straight‚Äîit did not. Throughout the 1850s and 1860s the federal government officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs continued to recognize the Burt Lake (Cheboigan) band of Ottawa Indians centered at Indian Village on Indian Point. A new treaty with them was supposed to take place in the summer of 1864 but federal negotiators only got as far north that summer and fall as the Saginaw Bay area to negotiate with the Chippewa bands at Black River, Swan Creek and Saginaw. The October 18, 1864 TREATY WITH THE CHIPPEWA OF SAGINAW, SWAN CREEK, AND BLACK RIVER used the term \\"bands\\" to describe the three mentioned Indian political units as stipulated in the 1855 Treaty. Soon to be named Mackinac Indian Agency superintendent Richard M. Smith, who had been present in Detroit during the creation of Article 5 in 1855, was also present for the October 1864 negotiations in Michigan, again acting as a secretary. The other Ottawa bands of Michigan including the Burt Lake Band were left out of being able to negotiate new 1864 treaties and by 1869 the newly appointed head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Ely Parker, decided no new negotiations in Michigan were necessary. Then, in 1871, the now Superintendent of the Mackinac Indian Agency, Major James W. Long, in reading the 1855 Treaty of Detroit language written down in Article 5 interpreted it to mean that with the last annuity payments guaranteed in the early Michigan treaties, the Indians of Michigan became United States citizens and all Native political organizations then were extinguished in Michigan. Long had not been present during either treaty in 1836 and 1855 and did not understand the INTENT of Article 5. To add to the problem, in 1872 the Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano picked up on the Long misinterpretation and he voiced the opinion that the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan no longer belonged to any political organization‚Äî\\"bands\\" included. Even though this was not true, and even though the Michigan Indians were not yet true citizens of the United States, Long's and Delano's misinterpretations began to become part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs official policy. To add to the incorrect factual beliefs surrounding the Ottawa and Chippewa in Michigan, the state constitution of 1850 had language in it that some interpreted to mean all Native males of Michigan were granted citizenship. Thus, all were able to vote in state and local elections. Again, this was not a factual INTENT of the language written into the 1850 document. It was put there to cover the Metis (1/2 white 1/2 Indian) large population of the upper peninsula who had become the major populace of that area due to the fur trade with French Montreal. Thus, some area in Michigan allowed the Native vote, while others did not. It seemed to be under \\"local option.\\" If the Native vote could be used for political convenience it was allowed to take place. That was true in Cheboygan County where the Burt Lake band members were allowed to vote. From 1860 until October 1900, the residents of Indian Village, living in some twenty cabins in all, farmed, raised livestock, hunted, gathered, fished and had a self- sustained life. That life also included selling craft ware (baskets, herbs, blankets) to visiting summer tourists who stopped by the village on day cruises along the \\"Inland Waterway\\" from Crooked Lake northeast to the city of Cheboygan. Many of the men of the village worked in the local lumber mills or camps and to supplement their farming. Their land on the peninsula was valuable either for the red oak timber that grew there or the potential shoreline real estate lots that could be sold to the ever-increasing summer tourists. After the Burn-Out, the Cheboigan/Sheboygan/Cheboygan/Burt Lake Band of Indians, with its century-old village now gone, began a gradual decline in population. However, the 1910 census of Burt Township, Cheboygan County, Michigan showed close to 130 Native people living in close proximity to Indian Point, just north on Indian Trail road. Instead of listing farming as the main occupation of this settlement's males, as had been shown in the 1900 Indian Village census, lumbering occupations were now listed. The 1930 census showed twelves families of Natives centered around the St. Mary's Catholic Church on Indian Road with six heads of household being listed as farmers. By the 1940 census, Indian Road was home to forty-eight Native residents with six heads of households. Two were listed as farmers and the others as laborers.Summary Under Criteria & Evidence for Final Determination - Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Inc., September 21, 2006. By the late 1970s the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa & Chippewa Indians was a scattered band of descendants of the original Indian Village residents of October 1900. On October 5, 1977, Margaret (Nongueskwa) Martell, daughter of John and Jennie Nonqueskwa of Indianville in Burt Township (born there in 1920), organized a meeting in Lansing, Michigan of all descendants she could find from the Burt Lake Band of Indian Village. In early January 1978 (January 14, 1978), twenty-seven descendants (or in-laws of descendants) of Indian Village residents signed a petition requesting the Native American Rights Fund to represent the \\"Cheboygan Band of Ottawa\\" in a lawsuit pertaining to the parcels of land lost to John W. McGinn as a consequence of his Burn-Out action in October 1900. Martell was helped in her efforts by Louise (Cabinaw) Reznick, daughter of Louis and Margaret Cabinaw, who had been appointed by Governor G. Mennen Williams in 1956 to be a paid employee of the Governor's Commission on Indians. The Governor was looking into compensation for the Burt Lake Band as a result of the 1900 Burn-Out. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Louise Reznick worked on behalf of the Burt Lake Band educating descendants of the original Indian Village residents. Along with Martell and Reznick, Loretta Massey Parkey became involved in the effort to revitalize the Burt Lake Band in 1978. She lived on Indian Road close to the second St. Mary's Catholic Church. By the 1980s the Burt Lake Band had incorporated as the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (July 16, 1980), a non-profit organization in the State of Michigan. The organizing group worked with Michigan Indian Legal Services headquartered in Lansing, Michigan to help bring this about. By 1986 the State of Michigan formally recognized the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, but after petitioning the federal government for federal recognition on September 6, 1985 the petition was finally declined on September 21, 2006. It was declined on the grounds that the Burt Lake Band failed to meet the Bureau of Indian Affairs established criterion for federal recognition. The rules established by the Bureau in 1978 as 25 C.F.R. (Criteria For Recognition) Section 83.t A,B,C,D,E,F,G lay out how the process by which an American Indian Tribe can by be federally acknowledged. The Burt Lake Band was found to meet the criteria of 83.7a, 83.7.d, 83.7f and 83.7g but the Bureau found determined 83.7 b, 83.7 c and 83.7e. Failure to meet any of the seven mandatory criteria meant that the petitioning group (The Burt Lake Band of Indians) did not exist as an Indian tribe within the meaning of the 1978 federal law. The criteria which was met included the Indian entity (Burt Lake Band) had been observed by outsiders to exist on a continuous basis since the 1917 lawsuit brought by the Attorney General of the United States. The band had a constitution which described its membership rules and governing procedures. The band also had an official membership that was not principally made up of members of other federally recognized tribes and the Burt Lake Band had not been expressly terminated or forbidden by Congressional legislation. However, it was the Bureau's belief that the band did not sufficiently show enough evidence to demonstrate a large portion of its membership list existed as a community at present. The band did not provide sufficient evidence that it had a continuous group of identified leaders since 1917 to the present and finally, that only 70 percent of its members could demonstrate descent from Indian Village residents who were part of the historic tribe centered along the shore of Burt Lake (Lake Cheboigan).  Afterword  A long, drawn out court fight finally ended in May 1917. On May 31, Federal District Court Judge Clarence W. Sessions (sitting in for Judge Arthur J. Tuttle who had earlier recused himself from the case) issued an eight-page decree in favor of the defendant John W. McGinn's estate. McGinn had died in January 1912. By then his wife and his son John T. McGinn had built a large lake shore farm house on the former property of the Burt Lake Band and had also built two barns and some outbuildings on the cleared parcels of land once farmed by the Indian Village residents. The Session's ruling stated: > The Cheboygan Indians were a small band and have never been treated, > considered or recognized as a nation or a tribe. Their lands, whether held > as communal property by the band or in severalty (held separately) by the > individual members, were not tribal lands and hence were not within the > prohibition of the General Act of Congress forbidding conveyance of lands > belonging to a nation or tribe of Indians without consent of the Government. > Whatever may have been the earlier status of these Indians, by treaty, in > 1855, the tribal organization of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan > was dissolved... To all appearances the Federal Government abandoned and > relinquished all right of guardianship over these Indians and their property > more than a third of a century before the present suit was instituted...The > question upon which the decision of this case hinges is whether these lands > were taxable. That question must be answered in the affirmative... Upon the > full performance of treaty (1855) obligations, the dissolution of the tribal > organization of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan, and their final > attainment of citizenship (1850 Michigan constitution)... the Government > relinquished its right of guardianship over these Indians and their property > and cannot now represent them...A decree will be entered dismissing the Bill > of Complaint without costs.Department of Justice File No. 158012, Burt Lake > Band. The May 31, 1917 decree by Judge Sessions was based on his use of gathered facts that led him to believe the federal government had no standing in the case. The same facts led him to believe that the \\"Burt Lake Band of Cheboygan Indians\\" had no legal status as an entity. However, the work by noted scholar and historian Richard White (now at Stanford University-CA) in 1978 titled, \\"The Ethnohistory of the Burt Lake Indians\\" shows clear evidence that Judge Sessions used incorrect data in making his May 1917 ruling. The Burt Lake Band of Cheboygan Indians was and had been a political unit in Michigan prior and after the Treaty of 1855 and thus a \\"sovereign nation entity\\" protected by any and all Native American treaties enjoined in by the United States federal government. Sessions statement that, \\"...Whatever may have been the earlier status of these Indians, by treaty, in 1855, the tribal organization of the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan was dissolved...\\" did not represent the true intent of the wording he used as his basis for his 1917 decree. The language used in ARTICLE 5 of the 1855 Treaty of Detroit, according to White's research of the original treaty journals kept that summer in Detroit by Bureau of Indian Affairs secretaries John Logan Chipman and Richard W. Smith), was intended to correct a wrong that had been made in the 1836 Treaty of Washington. That treaty stated that the Michigan Ottawa and Michigan Chippewa existed as \\"unified tribes,\\" and that was absolutely incorrect. At no time had the Ottawa people or the Chippewa people of the Michigan Territory ever existed under a unified Ottawa Tribe or a Chippewa Tribe. Michigan Native people had lived in the Great Lakes area since the early 1600s and had always existed as small bands or villages, or both, separated by distance to enhance their ability to hunt, fish and gather. As needed, these bands might have migrated to different spots according to the seasons or for better hunting grounds. At no time did any of these bands exist under common leadership by one chief. The Treaty of 1836 used the terms Ottawa Tribe and Chippewa Tribe only as a convenience for government negotiators. Since the 1855 treaty was based on the earlier 1836 document, the use of these terms continued but Article 5 was put into the 1855 document on request of the Native leaders to correct the earlier misnomer of tribe. White's research found the intent of the Article 5 language was soon lost in the bureaucratic halls of Washington and by the time Judge Sessions did his research for a judgement in the United States Government vs. John W. McGinn case, he was using false facts provided to him by various government entities. The Burt Band had never been dissolved and furthermore, the parcels of land patented for the area of Indian Village on Indian Point had not been in \\"severalty\\" (individually) but issued to the Governor of Michigan in trust for the Cheboygan Indians of whom Kie-she-go-way is chief. There were six separate land patents issued this way from February 1848 until April 1850. The Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians exist today as a State of Michigan recognized Band (1986) and since 1985 have been working to achieve re-recognition as a federally acknowledged Band by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

However, after failing to join the Valencians, Sugi returned to Japan to play for Sendai University until October 2012, when Gaspar Campillo, coach and sporting director of FC Jove Espa√±ol San Vicente, decided to sign him after positive reports written by Subirats. He signed an 18-month deal with the Valencian side, but due to bureaucratic problems, was unable to play with the main squad in Tercera Divisi√≥n, and was assigned to the B-team in the regional levels. After Jove Espa√±ol's assignment as a farm team of H√©rcules CF, Sugi was called up to the latter's first-team, by manager Quique Hern√°ndez. He played his first match as a professional on 11 September 2013, replacing Quique de Lucas in the 56th minute of a 2‚Äì0 home win against Real Murcia, for the season's Copa del Rey, becoming the first Asian to play for H√©rcules. Sugi made his league debut on 17 November 2013, again from the bench in a 2‚Äì4 loss at C√≥rdoba CF for the Segunda Divisi√≥n championship, and scored his first professional goal seven days later, netting the last of a 3‚Äì0 home success against CE Sabadell.
