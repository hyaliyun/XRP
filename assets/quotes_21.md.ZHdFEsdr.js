In a very few cases this is due to the termination of the work for which the community was established, but in most cases it is due to amalgamation or the death of the final remaining member of the community. Former communities for men=Brotherhood of the Epiphany (BE) The Brotherhood of the Epiphany, also known as St. Paul's Brotherhood, was an Anglican religious order for men founded in 1879 by priests associated with the Oxford Mission. The order was originally based in Calcutta, and later expanded to include houses in other parts of northern India and present-day Bangladesh. With the closure of the Indian houses, jurisdiction was transferred from the Church of North India to the Church of Bangladesh. The final house of the order was at Bogra Road in Barisal, Bangladesh. It oversaw boarding schools, Christian youth hostels, a medical centre, an orphanage, and a primary school. The community was reported as active in 2003, but by 2011 was no longer listed on the Anglican Communion directory of religious communities. The Oxford Mission, an associated body, states on its website \\"The brotherhood has come to an end, but in India the work continues under an Administrator appointed by the Bishop of Kolkata, and in Bangladesh under the supervision of the Diocese of Dhaka.\\"See the Oxford Mission website. Ewell Monastery (OC) Ewell Monastery was an experimental Cistercian community of monks within the Anglican Church from 1966 to 2004, located at West Malling in Kent. The revival of religious communities within the Anglican Communion during the 18th century, and more especially the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was influenced by many of the traditional monastic rules, particularly those of the Benedictine, Franciscan, and Augustinian Orders. There were few attempts to revive the Cistercian Rule within the Anglican communion prior to 1966, and none that lasted more than a few years. In 1966 the Revd Fr Aelred Arneson OC, established his Cistercian community,History detailed here. which came to receive official recognition by both the Church of England and the world-wide Cistercian Order within the Roman Catholic Church. Fr Aelred OC was the Prior throughout the life of the monastery.Details at this directory page. The Abbey buildings were constructed on the site of a former farm, with an ancient Tithe Barn being developed into the community chapel. This chapel still remains after the closure of the monastery, and is a Grade II* listed building.Official listing status shown here. The Cistercian Rule was never popular within Anglicanism, and the community never numbered more than five members, although these were often strengthened by temporary residents at the monastery from amongst the associates of the Order. In 2004 the community shrank again leaving the Prior, Fr Aelred, as the only remaining member living under vows. The decision was taken to end the Cistercian experiment and the monastery was closed.Closure notice shown here. Fr Aelred continues to live the religious life as a Cistercian solitary, with the distinction of being the sole member of the worldwide Anglican Communion to be living under the strict Cistercian Rule of life, although some Anglican religious follow an adapted form of the Cistercian Rule. In 2010 a dispersed, uncloistered community was established as the Order of Anglican Cistercians in the Church of England. Former communities for women=Community of the Epiphany (CE) :Not to be confused with the Sisterhood of the Epiphany (see below). The Community of the Epiphany was founded in 1883 by George Wilkinson, Bishop of Truro,Article by Richard Savill ‚ÄúLast surviving nun of 127 year-old order‚Äù (p. 7) Daily Telegraph Tuesday 4 November 2008 who afterwards became Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane.\\"Death of The Bishop of St. Andrews\\".The Times; Thursday, Dec 12, 1907; p. 4; Issue 38514; col C The community was formed for work in the Truro diocese and was based at the Convent of the Epiphany, Truro, Cornwall. The sisters were involved in pastoral and educational work, the care of Truro Cathedral and St Paul's Church, and church needlework. The head of the community was the Mother Superior. There was for some forty years an active branch house in Tokyo, Japan, and there was a more long-term branch house at Penzance.Cornish Church Guide. Truro: Blackford; pp. 325-26 Branch houses were also opened in Newquay, and Truro (separate from the mother house). The sisters ran a convalescent home in St Agnes, and in Truro (in addition to the main convent and the Truro branch house) they ran a small school (Rosewin School) and a retreat house (St Michael's House). The main convent was originally located at Alverton House in Tregolls Road. The house, built in the early nineteenth century, was extended for the convent, and the chapel was built in 1910 by Edmund H. Sedding.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Harmondsworth: Penguin; pp. 234-35 After a century at Tregolls Road it moved to Copeland Court in Kenwyn. After a very full history, covering 125 years, the community was reduced to its last surviving member. In 2008 Sr Elizabeth CE attracted some attention in the local and national press, as the last surviving member of the order; she was then 92, and living in a nursing home, but still engaged in charitable work. In 1936 the sisters founded a parallel community for Japanese women, the Community of Nazareth, which achieved full independence in the 1960s. This community continues its work in Tokyo and Okinawa. Community of Jesus of Nazareth An Anglican order of sisters whose convent was in the small village of Westcote in Gloucestershire. It was founded by Mother Geraldine Mott at the suggestion of Brother Edward Bulstrode of the Cowley Fathers to support the establishment of a training centre for village evangelism. It was the only Anglican Order in the British Isles to live on faith and trust alone. The Sisters brought nothing with them, no dowry, and were allowed no income. They relied on prayer, hard work and donations to sustain them and their missions. The Sisters‚Äô chief work was to provide help for priests in their parishes. As the years went by, the community was asked to work in many parishes including Pentonville, Poplar, Peckham, Acton and Knightsbridge in London, Burgess Hill in Sussex and St. Aidan‚Äôs Birmingham, St. Peter‚Äôs Plymouth, Grimsby, Hull and Sunderland where Archbishop Ramsey visited the Sisters from York. He subsequently wrote to the Convent, asking for more help in the province. Their work ranged far and wide from Tewkesbury Abbey to St. Albans and to St Ninian's Cathedral, Perth. The Community was active from 1927 to 1969, at which point it merged with the Little Sisters of Charity at Knowle, Bristol. Community of the Presentation (CP) Founded in 1927 as a nursing order, originally named the Nursing Community of Christ the Consoler,See brief history in the Anglican Religious Communities Yearbook 2000-01, page 6. the sisters lived in a convent and nursing home in Highgate in north London, and maintained a convalescent home in Hythe, Kent, and after a short time renamed themselves the Community of the Presentation. In 1935 they took over St Saviour's House from the Community of the Epiphany. This House, opened in Regents Park in 1845, and relocated to Osnaburgh Street, London, in 1852, was also a nursing home, and the Presentation sisters closed their original Highgate home. In 1960 St Saviour's House was subject to a compulsory purchase order, and the sisters decided to relocate to the site of their existing convalescent home in Hythe, opening a new thirteen-bed hospital, St Saviour's Hospital. Running the hospital alone until 1975, from January 1976 the sisters began to employ nurses who were not members of the community. Their numbers declined, and a Board of Trustees took over the running of the hospital. Brigadier Ronnie Winfield, appointed Chairman of the Trustees in 1981, began an expansion programme up to a modern standard 36-bed hospital, and in 1989 this was sold to a private hospital company. The sisters' chapel had already been sold and converted into a private clinic. The remaining assets of the Community of the Presentation were invested to form the St Saviour's Medical Charity, for the benefit of the people of Hythe.See full history by Bruce Tait in Hythe Civic Society Newsletter, edition 153 (2010). The last remaining sisters continued to live in the convent beside the hospital during these last changes, until only one sister remained. Sr May CP moved in 1997 to live with the Community of St Francis in Birmingham, and died on 9 January 1999, ending the life of the Community. From 1960 until the 1980s the sisters were the owners and guardians of The Buxheim Carvings. Community of St Michael and All Angels (CSM&AA;) Bishop Edward Twells (Bishop of Bloemfontein) wrote in 1868 highlighting the need for a Sisterhood to set up schools for girls in Bloemfontein.Karel Schoeman, 1986. The Free State Mission: The Anglican Church in the OFS, 1863-1883, pages 18-19. The Community was founded by Twells' successor, Bishop Allan Webb in 1874. A party of seven led by Mother Emma (Mother Superior) traveled from England to Bloemfontein in 1874, and immediately opened a boarding school, St Michael's, and a day school.Karel Schoeman, 1986. The Free State Mission: The Anglican Church in the OFS, 1863-1883, page 42-53. St Michael's School exists to this day as one of the leading schools in South Africa. In 1877 the Community also established the St George's Cottage Hospital in Bloemfontein, the first hospital in the Orange Free State.Karel Schoeman, 1986. The Free State Mission: The Anglican Church in the OFS, 1863-1883, page 54. The Community also pioneered nursing ministry in Kimberley, from 1876, where Sister Henrietta Stockdale organised the training of nurses at the Carnarvon Hospital. She was later influential in securing the first state registration of nurses in the world, in 1891. Sister Joan Marsh, the last member of the Community, died aged 97 in Bloemfontein in May 2016.St Michael‚Äôs say farewells to beloved Sister Joan  Community of the Servants of the Cross  This community was founded in 1877 to nurse and care for the aged and infirm, and to live a life of prayer and hospitality. It was unusual in aiming to recruit nuns from working-class backgrounds, rather than the upper middle class from which many orders drew their sisters. The community moved to Sussex in 1895 where it remained for over 100 years. Their Chichester convent closed in 1996, and the Sisters moved to a nursing home on the site of the former Chichester Theological College, and the last sister died in 2003. Community of Reparation to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament (CRJBS) A community of nuns in the Church of England, founded in 1869, whose work came to an end in the early 1990s. The last remaining member, Sr Esther Mary CRJBS, lived for several years (and into the 21st century) with the sisters of the Community of St John Baptist (CSJB), and then for the final months of her life moved to St Peter's Convent, Woking. The order was founded following a meeting at All Saints, Margaret Street, by members of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament (including the President, Canon Carter of Clewer, and his friend Father Goulden), to make reparation for any dishonour perceived to have been done to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. From 1869 to 1872 the first sisters served as novices at CSJB, but from 1872 they worked together from a mission house in Southwark, south London. In 1911 they were able to construct their own convent, the Convent of Reparation, Rushworth Street, Southwark. In 1948 they opened a second convent, the Convent of Reparation, White Rose Lane, Woking (Surrey). Congregation of the Servants of Christ (CSC) From 1906 the community were based in Pleshy, in what is now the Chelmsford Diocesan House of Retreat, before moving to Potters Bar in 1914 after clashing with the Evangelical first Bishop of Chelmsford Bishop John Watts-Ditchfield. From 1920 the Congregation of the Servants of Christ lived at Britwell Court near Burnham, Buckinghamshire, renaming it The House of Prayer. The Sisters joined with the Community of St Mary at the Cross at Edgware in October 1989. Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration (PCRep) The 'Poor Clares' are the second order of the Franciscan religious movement, more formally known as the Order of St Clare. The Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration were founded in 1922 and based at St Clare's Convent on Mount Sinai, Long Island, New York. Members of the Order of St Clare live an enclosed life, and the Poor Clares of Reparation and Adoration also maintained a perpetual watch before the Blessed Sacrament. The last remaining sister died in 2003,Her death is reported here. leaving the Community of St. Clare in England as the only remaining Poor Clare community in the Anglican Communion. However, the Little Sisters of St. Clare in the United States do have some members living the Poor Clare life and Rule, within the somewhat flexible bounds of that community's style. Sisterhood of the Epiphany (SE) :Not to be confused with the Community of the Epiphany (see above). The Sisterhood of the Epiphany (SE), more formally entitled the Oxford Mission Sisterhood of the Epiphany, was a companion body for women, working alongside the Brotherhood of the Epiphany (see above) in India and Bangladesh. The Sisterhood was founded in 1902 under the leadership of Edith Langridge, and followed a slightly adapted version of the Benedictine Rule. The mother house was located at Barisal (then British India, but now Bangladesh), and there were several branch houses, the largest at Calcutta. The work of the sisters was very broad in scope, including evangelism, medical work, educational activity amongst women, and (in Calcutta) the provision of both a primary school and an orphanage. In 1970 a parallel community was founded for sisters of Bangladeshi nationality, named the Christa Sevika Sangha (Handmaids of Christ), and in 1986 this order became fully independent.Read summary history at this Oxford Mission page. The foundress, Sr Susila SE, left the Sisterhood of the Epiphany to become the first Mother Superior CSS, an office she still held until her death on 16 May 2011.Her death is reported here . At the same time another sister (Sr Leonore SE) transferred to the Community of St. Francis in order to follow the Franciscan Rule. By the early 1990s only three SE sisters remained, and they left Bangladesh (where the work in continued by CSS) and returned to England, taking up residence at Ditchingham with the Community of All Hallows. The last three sisters died there - Mother Joan in 1999, Sr Rosamund in 2003, and Mother Winifred on 26 May 2010, when the Sisterhood ended.'Sisterhood of the Epiphany' article in Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, published 2011 by Canterbury Press, Norwich, page 5. Society of the Most Holy Trinity (SHT) The Society of the Most Holy Trinity, also known more simply as the Society of the Holy Trinity, was established by Lydia Sellon in 1849, the second Anglican religious order established for women, to minister to the poor in the seafaring community of Devonport, hence their popular name, the Devonport Sisters. The Society expanded rapidly, and in the 1850s absorbed several smaller London communities, including the first- established, the Sisterhood of the Holy Cross (or 'Park Village Community'). The order grew large and very active, from its work with Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, to the establishing of a convalescent hospital and a grammar school (St Christopher's). The rule of the order was based on that of St Francis de Sales.See \\"Guide to the Religious Communities of the Anglican Communion\\", Mowbrays, 1951, page 53. From 1860, the community was resident at Ascot Priory in Berkshire, which remained its headquarters until the closure of the community in 2004. At the start of the 2000s the community had grown very small, and some sisters were placed with other (larger) orders, such as Sr Rosemary SHT who lived her final years with the Community of the Holy Name. The last sister was Reverend Mother Cecilia SHT, who joined the community in 1935, having been born in 1914, and offered herself as a postulant at the age of 18. She died on 12 February 2004, aged 89, and thus ended the life of the Society. Before her death, Mother Cecilia established a trust to ensure that the buildings at Ascot Priory continued to be used for the good of the Church of England and of society in general, principally in the care of the elderly, but also through the provision of facilities for retreats and conferences. Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary John Collier The Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary was a Franciscan Order, founded in London in 1916; it took its name from the 13th-century saint and princess Elizabeth of Hungary (Elizabeth of Thuringia), who was influenced by the early Franciscans and lived a religious life in Marburg. The Order was founded as an offshoot of the Confraternity of Divine Love, and Reverend Mother Elizabeth (Elizabeth Ann Hodges, 1869-1960) was the founder both of the Confraternity and of the Order in its final form. It retained three male priests to function as the Visitor, the Warden, and the Chaplain. In 1923 the Visitor was the Bishop of London, and the Warden was the Revd and Hon E. Lyttleton DD. The English Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary was devoted mainly to mission work among the poor of Southwest London, and was based at the Convent of St Elizabeth, 94 Redcliffe Gardens, London SW10, and had retreat houses at Oakhurst (Kent), and St Mary's Retreat, Heathfield (Sussex). It also had a children's home and guest house at 10 Earl's Court Square, London, and a home for retired ladies at Mayfield (Sussex). St Margaret's Guest House was also operated at Heathfield, near St Mary's Retreat. The Order also operated extensively in Western Australia, with convents at Bunbury, Busselton, and Margaret River.See 'Guide to the Religious Communities of the Anglican Communion', Mowbray, London, 1951, page 62. The sisters undertook missions to women and girls, and were responsible for Church Girl's Institutes as well as Children's Homes. The sisters observed a fruitarian diet, and were committed to absolute poverty, owning no property or invested funds. A short history of the Order and its work among the poor was published in 1967 entitled Into the Deep and subtitled \\"The story of the Confraternity of the Divine Love and the Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary by Mother Elizabeth of the Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary‚Äù. Little Grey Sparrows of the Anglican Diocese of Bunbury, Western Australia by Merle Bignall (1992) deals with the history of the Order with particular reference to its work in Australia, which began in the 1920s. The Sisters of the Order referred to themselves as Sparrows and wore grey habits. The Order continued to appear in the Post Office Directory at 94 Redcliffe Gardens until 1971. By 2000, it was under the care of the Anglican Community of St Peter (founded 1861), which is based at St Peter‚Äôs Convent, Maybury Hill, Woking, Surrey. The archives of the Order of St Elizabeth of Hungary for the period 1904-1990 are held at Lambeth Palace Library in London under reference 3862-93. Community of St Wilfrid The Community of St Wilfrid was founded in Exeter in 1866 by the Reverend John Gilberd Pearse, Rector of All Hallows-on-the-Wall Church in that city. From a convent in Bartholomew Street the sisters had a ministry to the poor and underprivileged, for whom they had been founded. The sisters lived in the convent for a hundred years from 1866 to 1966. In 1870, under the provisions of the Elementary Education Act 1870, the sisters opened the Forty School to provide a basic education to 40 poor children in the city. The school grew in size and importance, and became the community's main work, eventually under the name St Wilfrid's School. The sisters also ran an orphanage, a soup kitchen, and outreach ministries amongst the poor and the destitute. The sisters and the school had their own chapels, but on the Feast of St Wilfrid each year the sisters and the children of the school all paraded through the streets to Exeter Cathedral for their patronal festival celebrations. The community gave up running the school in 1988 as the remaining teaching sisters were elderly, but the school was handed over to independent operation, and remains open, continuing the charism and history of the community. The noviciate of the community was closed, and following the death of the final sisters (Sister Elsie in 1997, and Mother Lillian in 2004, aged 107) the community closed.

The song was created over a period of three months by splicing syllables from previously recorded vocals by Chrisye. At the concert, spliced black-and-white footage of Chrisye was shown lip synching to the song while Erwin's orchestra performed the music. The song was well received: the audience gave it a rowdy ovation, while critics praised its lyrics and described it as one of the best parts of the concert. Background Chrisye had a forty-year career in Indonesia's music industry, starting as a bassist with Sabda Nada before his first stint as a vocalist on the indie album Guruh Gipsy (1976). After the success of the song \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" (\\"Small Candles\\"; 1977) and album Badai Pasti Berlalu (The Storm Shall Surely Pass; 1977), he began a solo career with Musica Studios. Before his death of lung cancer on 30 March 2007, he released nineteen albums with Musica. In 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia listed Chrisye as the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Towards the fifth anniversary of Chrisye's death, Chrisye's widow Yanti Noor, director Jay Subiyakto, and composer Erwin Gutawa began collaborating for a concert; the concert was announced on 29 February 2012 and marketed as Chrisye's fourth concert. It was held on 5 April 2012 at Plenary Hall in the Jakarta Convention Centre and featured a hologram of Chrisye singing with Once Mekel, Vina Panduwinata, Sophia Latjuba, and the band Gigi. Another feature of the concert was \\"Kidung Abadi\\" (\\"Eternal Ballad\\"). Composition and performance \\"Kidung Abadi\\" was written by father/daughter team Erwin and Gita Gutawa. The song was composed by Erwin Gutawa, who had previously collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, he said that he felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert. To record the vocals, the elder Gutawa and a ten-member team of researchers compiled thousands of syllables from Chrisye's older songs, obtained from the masters, in a database. Some syllables were kept unaltered, while others were amalgamated to form a single sound or more than one; according to Kompas, the \\"ku\\" syllables in \\"Kidung Abadi\\" were an amalgamation of 1,056 \\"ku\\" syllables in Chrisye's previous songs. Ultimately, a total of 246 syllables were combined in Pro Tools to form the new song; the program was also used to change the pitch of numerous syllables. Gutawa inserted pauses where he assumed Chrisye would have paused if singing the song in real life; he based his choices on his previous experience with Chrisye. The entire process, from writing to recording, took three months. The song was initially performed at the Kidung Abadi concert on as the penultimate song. It was overlaid on a black-and-white video of Chrisye singing projected on an screen. The video was created by Jay Subiyakto, who spliced together archived footage of Chrisye performing. Chrisye's lips were synchronised to move in time with the vocals. Subiyakto stated that he did not base the work on foreign shows, choosing instead to start from scratch. The music was provided by a live orchestra. Reception Eko Sutriyanto, writing for Tribun, called the song one of the best parts of the concert, although he considered the synchronisation off. Frans Sartono wrote in Kompas that the song was \\"touching\\", quoting the lyrics \\"See the times pass, I'm here and you're there.... Though now I'm far from you, I'll keep singing. Hear my melody flow; this is for you\\" as reflecting Chrisye's unique style. The thousands-strong crowd gave the song a rowdy ovation after the performance.

T-Labs are working since 2006 in close cooperation with the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and other universities, such as the Berlin University of the Arts, the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest, and the TU Wien (Austria). History T-Labs were founded in 2004 as the central research and development institute of Deutsche Telekom under the direction of Manfred Jeromin. At the same time, T-Labs are also a so-called affiliated institute of Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin), meaning that T-Labs is a privately organized entity that is closely integrated in the teaching and research activities conducted at TU Berlin. This concept promotes intensive collaboration between research and industry. Experts, entrepreneurs and researchers work together on innovations intended for real-world application scenarios and on disruptive technologies in the area of information and communications technology. T-Labs follow a consistent Open Innovation approach and are themselves an innovation as an affiliated institute and thus pioneered a new form of research and development. In a report for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), T-Labs have been presented as a benchmark example of modern innovation management. At the beginning, 25 telecom employees and about 50 scientists from many countries worked at the T-Labs. Peter M√∂ckel took over the management from November 2004 to 2011. Under his leadership, several professorships were established at the TU Berlin and a team was set up in Silicon Valley in 2009. In order to design the academic work, a scientific management board was set up which was initially led by Bernd Girod from Stanford University and then Wolfgang Wahlster from the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Sahin Albayrak from the TU Berlin. In 2008, 100 other telecom experts were integrated into the T-Labs and other scientists were hired in parallel. First companies were founded. Heinrich Arnold was responsible for the reorientation of Telekom Laboratories to more application and implementation-oriented topics. In the course of this reorientation, he took over the management of T-Labs from 2011 until 2016. During this period the foundations were laid for three new business units in the area of cloud computing, smart home and mobile payment for and within Deutsche Telekom. In addition, further focus areas with the topics of health, energy, Machine to machine and media were established. As a result, a number of cross-industrial projects have been carried out for the digital industry, such as in the port of Hamburg in 2012 with industrial partners such as SAP SE, Adidas, Claas, Osram, Siemens, KUKA and Trumpf. Under the leadership of Heinrich Arnold, about 20 new spin-offs were founded, among others Trust2Core, SureNow, Litedesk, Motionlogic, Benocs, Soundcall, Zimory, Bitplaces, Schaltzeit as well as the digital cloudbased telecommunications service immmr (2016). In 2016, the EU-Labs programm were found together with the TU-Berlin, to expand the international collaboration. The first institution within this strategy was established at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest. The new professorship \\"Data science and Engineering\\" has its focus on the evaluation of economic and environmental relevant data with the help from mobile networks. In 2017, another professorship at the TU Vienna was instituted. In January 2017, the Management Board division of technology and innovation were found. Since 2017 the T-Labs are under the lead of Dr. Alex Choi and John Calian. Dr. Choi reports directly to Claudia Nemat, the head of the Management board division technology and innovation. In May 2018 John Calian became the Head of the Telekom Innovation Laboratories (T-Labs), in addition to being Vice President of the Blockchain Group, which he founded in June 2017. John is a blockchain expert and well known speaker in the blockchain community and events. As Head of T-Labs, John Calian is responsible for developing and leading innovation topics for Deutsche Telekom and its partners. Prior to joining T-Labs, John held numerous technology leadership roles and was the founder and COO of multiple startup software firms in the Seattle area. Mr. Calian holds an MBA in Technology Management from the University of Washington. Organization and fields of research The T-Labs are working within the Deutsche Telekom for all kind of corporate divisions. With the affiliate institution with the TU Berlin and many other professorships at universities worldwide, an intensive exchange between science and industry is provided. Since 2017 the T-Labs focus on three main topics: * Blockchain and Smart Cities * New Media Experience * Deep Learning / Machine Learning The fields of research at TU Berlin included * Internet Network Architectures, (2006 - 2013) by Anja Feldmann * Quality and Usability, (2007 - 2015) by Prof. Sebastian M√∂ller * Interaction Design and Media (2008 - 2010) by Prof. Gesche Joost (since 2010 professor in Design Research at Berlin University of the Arts) * Autonomous Security (2009 - 2011) by Tansu Alpcan (now at University of Melbourne) * Assessment of IP-based Applications, (2009 - 2015) by Prof. Alexander Raake (since 2015 professor at Technische Universit√§t Ilmenau) * Service-centric Networking, (since 2009) by Prof. Axel K√ºpper * Security in Telecommunications, (since 2010) by Prof. Jean-Pierre Seifert Other prioritised topics of the partners are: * Data- and network security as well as social networks (since 2006) at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev by Prof. Yuval Elovici * Design research and Design Research Lab (since 2010) at Berlin University of the Arts by Prof. Gesche Joost * Data Science and Engineering (since 2016) at E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University by Dr. Thom√°s Horv√°th * Data Intelligence (since 2017) at TU Vienna by Prof. Allan Hanbury Research scientists Some of the experts and scientists who have been working for the T-Labs (who can be found via Wikipedia) : * Heinrich Arnold * Yaniv Altshuler * Georg Essl * Anja Feldmann * Gesche Joost * Sebastian M√∂ller * Alexander Raake * Sascha Spors Results In October 2009, Alcatel-Lucent's Bell Labs, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz Institute and antenna supplier Kathrein conducted live field tests of a technology called Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) aimed at increasing the data transmission speeds of Long Term Evolution (LTE) and 3G networks.

Beginning as a condemnation of miserly behaviour, it eventually was taken to demonstrate how preferences differ. An image for misers Two Greek poems from the 2nd century CE seem to have contributed to the making of the modern fable. One is the four-line poem of Babrius about a fox who asks an ass how it can eat thorns with such a soft mouth, which is listed as 360 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site The other is a simile in a short poem by Lucian in the Greek Anthology (XI.397) in which he likens the behaviour of a miser to 'the life of mules, who often, carrying on their backs a heavy and precious load of gold, only eat hay'.Memorial University of Newfoundland Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, illustration from De warachtighe fabulen der dieren, 1567 Based on these, the Renaissance author Andrea Alciato created the image for misers in his Emblemata (1531). Below the picture of a loaded donkey that is stooping to eat a thistle he adds a Latin poem likening a rich man to an ass that, though it 'bears on its back costly victuals, he's a pauper who feeds himself on brambles and tough reeds'.Emblem 86 The English emblem-writer Geoffrey Whitney was later to use the same illustration provided with a 12-line epigram based on Alciato's in his Choice of Emblemes (1586).Emblem 18 Alciato's book was influential all over Europe and fathered many similar works. One of these was Joost van den Vondel's De Vorstelijke Warande der Dieren (1617), which raised Aesop's fables to emblematic status. Among them, however, is a poem about \\"The ass carrying food\\", the first four lines of which use the same likeness before continuing to a much longer consideration of human meanness.Poem 116 That the situation was already well known in the Netherlands is suggested by the engraver Rafael I Sadeler's emblematic \\"Landscape with ass eating thistle\\".In the collection of the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam Dating from 1598/9, it is based on an earlier design by Matthijs Bril. Earlier still, the Flemish engraver Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder had been involved in illustrating a similar emblem book based on fables, De warachtighe fabulen der dieren, 1567. Some of his designs were adapted by his son, by then a religious refugee in England, as rondels for trenchers. Included there was the picture of an ass laden with rich foods and cropping a thistle, surrounding which is the quatrain: ::: ::: ::: :::British Museum From emblem to fable In the previous century, Christopher Marlowe had identified the image without evidence as Aesop's in his play The Jew of Malta (first performed in 1592): ::: ::: ::: ::: :::The Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe, ed. Fredson Bowers, Cambridge University Press 1973, Act V.ii, lines 38-42, Volume 1, p.327 In this case, however, it was being quoted in an almost opposite sense to the emblematic usage, criticizing those who neglect the opportunity to amass wealth. A very similar emblematic design was used in Francis Barlow's illustrated volume of Aesop's Fables in 1687, where a final couplet of the short poetical commentary is applied to the miserly behaviour of \\"They that by brooding on their wealth are poore/ Without injoyment amidst all theyr store\\".De Asino rubos comedente, Fable 5 However, the Latin description tells a very different story of the laden donkey being asked by a dog why it prefers the roadside thistles. His reply is that to his taste \\"the thistles which I am eating are more pleasing to me and suit my palate better than all the meat in the butchers' and all the confections in the bakers' shops\\". Now that the situation was accepted as connected with Aesop, another writer set out to recreate the fable at greater length. The initiative of Samuel Croxall in his The Fables of Aesop and Others (1722), it was accompanied by much the same illustration and titled \\"The Ass eating Thistles\\". There an ass carrying all sorts of food to the harvesters himself chews on a thistle 'and while he was doing so he entered into this reflection: How many greedy epicures would think themselves happy, amidst such a variety of delicate viands as I now carry! But to me this bitter, prickly Thistle is more savory and relishing than the most exquisite and sumptuous banquet.' In addressing the moral lesson to be learned, Croxall quotes the English proverb 'One man's meat is another man's poison' and concludes 'he that expects all mankind should be of his opinion is much more stupid and unreasonable than the ass in the fable'.Fables of Aesop (1722), fable 163 More or less this wording was to be repeated from collection to collection for the next two centuries, while the former emblematic meaning was forgotten.

JUNQ and IPOD are types of cytosolic protein inclusion bodies in eukaryotes. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, are associated and correlated with protein aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins in inclusion bodies. For many years, protein aggregation was considered a random process by which misfolded proteins stick to each other to form inclusions (imagine a bundle of hairs haphazardly piling up in a corner of a room). Moreover, protein aggregates were thought to be toxic agents and the cause for neuronal dysfunction and death. However, recent studies, using advanced methods (i.e. fluorescence microscopy), show that protein aggregation may actually be a tightly regulated, organized process, by which the cell protects itself from toxic proteins by sequestration to inclusion bodies. In 2008, Daniel Kaganovich showed that eukaryotic cells sort misfolded proteins into two distinct inclusion bodies in a well-managed cellular process: #The JUNQ (JUxta Nuclear Quality control compartment) #The IPOD (Insoluble Protein Deposit) JUNQ and IPOD are evolutionarily conserved, and are found in specific and defined cellular sites. Delivery of misfolded, aggregated proteins to JUNQ and IPOD require an intact cytoskeleton and specific cellular quality control components, such as Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). The partition into the two distinct inclusion bodies is due to the different handling and processing of different kinds of misfolded proteins (e.g. ubiquitinated vs. non- ubiquitinated proteins). Segregation of toxic protein aggregates into JUNQ and IPOD inclusion bodies is a means by which mammalian cells can be rejuvenated through asymmetric division. Thus, the discovery of JUNQ and IPOD provided a new striking perspective of how cells manage misfolded aggregated proteins and gave convincing proof that protein aggregation is a non-random, well regulated and controlled cellular process. Furthermore, the discovery of JUNQ and IPOD suggested that in addition to temporal quality control (i.e. time dependent administration of damaged proteins) cells exploit homeostasis spatially: If degradation isn't available, protection of the cellular environment from a misfolded protein is accomplished by its sequestration to an aggregate inclusion.  Background  To function properly, most proteins must preserve a low-energy, three-dimensional structure known as the native state. The stability of a protein is tightly regulated through all its life stages: from cradle, as it is synthesized at the ribosome, through folding or assembly, till grave ‚Äì when the protein is degraded and cleared from the cellular environment. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis), results from the coordinated action of the different arms of the cellular quality control system: molecular chaperones, proteases and other regulatory factors. Hence, cellular viability depends on timely and efficient management of misfolded proteins. Such management, by the quality control machinery, includes recognition of the misfolded protein by chaperones and E3 ligases, ubiquitination and degradation. Proteostasis collapse, due to damage, stress, mutations, and aging, has been implicated as a basis for a large number of common human disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases. Although caused by different kinds of mutated proteins (e.g. in Huntington's disease ‚Äì the protein Huntingtin) and disruptive to distinct tissues (e.g. in Huntington's disease ‚Äì the striatum), such diseases share a common feature: accumulation of misfolded proteins in inclusion bodies. Thus, it was thought that the inclusion bodies are the cause of such diseases. However, the nature and characteristics of those intra-cellular inclusion bodies stayed elusive. Different kinds of proteins (e.g. prions, ERAD substrates) were reported to form different kinds of inclusion bodies (e.g. aggresomes, amyloids), yet it remained obscure if those observations combine into one and relate to the same sub-cellular site. Moreover, the pathways leading to inclusion formation and the involvement of the cellular protein quality control machinery were undefined and unknown. Thus, a systematic study providing a comprehensive understanding of protein aggregation and inclusion bodies was required. The discovery of JUNQ and IPOD suggested new insights of how the cell manages different kinds of misfolded proteins and offered a novel framework for putting together the great puzzle of protein aggregation. thumbupright=1.3Eukaryote cells sort misfolded proteins, based on their ubiquitination state, into two quality control compartments: 1\\\\. JUNQ (green), which is tethered to the nucleus (orange) 2\\\\. IPOD(green), which is tethered to the vacuole (black shadow)  Discovery  The fate of misfolded proteins and the process leading to the formation of aggregate inclusions, were initially studied using biochemical methods (e.g. western blotting). Deeper insights into the biological process of protein quality control and aggregation was made possible by a novel approach to looking at this problem, termed \\"Live Cell Imaging\\". Live cell imaging enables in vivo tracking of proteins in space and time, in their natural endogenous environment. Thus, such a method provides more information about the dynamics and stages of biological events and processes. The method takes advantage of the easily detectable fluorescent proteins fused to a protein of interest, which can then be followed inside a cell using a fluorescence microscope. The cell may then be treated by a perturbation of interest (e.g. a drug, expression of a misfolded protein), and various properties of the fluorescently tagged protein can be assayed using time-lapse microscopy: #Changes of the fluorescence level indicates changes of expression levels (i.e. higher levels = upregulation of a protein) #Changes of localization (e.g. entrance of a protein from the cytosol to the nucleus) #Solubility (e.g. by using the FRAP assay) #Interplay with the intracellular environment (e.g. by using the FLIP assay) In order to monitor the fate of cytosolic misfolded proteins in vivo, a plasmid carrying a GFP tagged folding reporter was cloned. The folding reporter, a model protein for aggregation, was a Ubc9 (SUMO- conjugating enzyme) mutant (UBC9ts), harboring a missense mutation (Y68L) with a temperature- sensitive (ts) phenotype. The marginally stable Ubc9ts is fully functional under physiological permissive conditions (25 ¬∞C) due to active cellular chaperones. The GFP‚ÄìUbc9ts was transformed into yeast and visualized using a fluorescence microscope. Monitoring the folding sensor GFP‚ÄìUbc9ts was thought to indicate the cellular proteostasis, and to assay the ability of the cellular protein quality control system to deal with various kinds of stress. It was then observed that under normal conditions, GFP‚ÄìUbc9ts is diffused in the nucleus and in the cytosol. However, upon heat shock, GFP‚ÄìUbc9ts formed cytosolic punctate structures. Strikingly, when the proteasome was impaired and clearance of the misfolded protein by degradation was blocked, two distinct cytosolic inclusions were observed to be formed. Standard and conservative biochemical methods, such as cell fractionation and western blotting would not have revealed the partition into the two types of cytosolic aggregates. The two detected inclusions were shown to be evolutionarily conserved quality control compartments, with different characteristics and distinct functions. They were named JUNQ (JUxta Nuclear Quality control compartment) and IPOD (Insoluble Protein Deposit), and represent two cellular pathways for the sequestration and management of aggregation prone, potentially toxic proteins. Partition of quality control substrates (i.e. misfolded proteins) to either compartment depends on their ubiquitination status and aggregation state (i.e. solubility): Proteins that are ubiquitinated are delivered to the JUNQ, where they are processed for degradation by the proteasome. Misfolded proteins that are not ubiquitinated and terminally aggregated are sequestered to the IPOD. Thus, the sub-cellular location of a misfolded protein (i.e. in the JUNQ or in the IPOD) provides information about its interaction with the cellular protein quality control machinery (e.g. its E3 ligase). JUNQ JUNQ is the JUxta Nuclear Quality control compartment. A JUNQ inclusion viewed by a ubiquitinated VHL protein(green), is tethered to the nucleus (orange). Significance To maintain cellular homeostasis, the cellular quality control system must distinguish between folded and misfolded proteins. A misfolded protein will be recognized and tightly taken care of by either refolding or ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. However, cellular increase of misfolded protein loads, due to various kinds of stresses (e.g. heat shock), may saturate and exhaust the quality control machinery. In such cases, degradation of misfolded proteins is unavailable, and a second line of active cellular defense mechanism must be executed: directing misfolded proteins to specific cellular sites. The JUNQ serves as such a sequestration site. It was shown that when the proteasome is impaired (e.g. by low expression levels of the proteasome subunit RPN11), ubiquitinated misfolded proteins are sorted into the JUNQ. Upon recovery from stress conditions (e.g. recovery from heat shock at a permissive temperature), misfolded proteins that accumulate in the JUNQ may be either refolded by the cellular chaperone machinery, or degraded by the 26S proteasome. Thus, the sequestration of a protein to the JUNQ is reversible. Properties The JUNQ is a non- membrane bound cellular site located in a margin of the nucleus, in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum. FRAP and FLIP assays revealed that proteins in the JUNQ are soluble and exchange with the cytosol, suggesting that the JUNQ has a dynamic structure. Delivery to the JUNQ depends on molecular chaperones and co-chaperones and on the actin cytoskeleton. Misfolded proteins must be ubiquitinated to be sorted to the JUNQ. If ubiquitination is blocked, a misfolded protein will be directed to the IPOD inclusion. Misfolded protein accumulation recruits 26S proteasomes to the JUNQ. IPOD IPOD is the Insoluble Protein Deposit compartment. An IPOD inclusion viewed by a non-ubiquitinated VHL protein(red), tethered to the vacuole (green). Significance It is becoming more evident that the cellular capacity to maintain proteostasis declines with age, thereby causing the late onset of neurodegenerative diseases. In such diseases (e.g. Huntington's disease), a mutated protein misfolds and becomes toxic to the cellular environment by various ways such as denaturating cytosolic proteins. Incompetent of degrading those toxic species, the cell must isolate them to avoid their hazardous interaction with the cellular proteome. The IPOD was shown to be the sub-cellular site to which toxic amyloidogenic proteins are sequestered to, hereby serving as a protective quality control compartment. In addition, it was suggested by the Lindquist group, that the IPOD is the site where yeast prions undergo a maturation process. Thus, the IPOD may serve not only as a sequestration site, but also as a functional compartment. Properties The IPOD is a non- membrane bound cellular site, which in yeast is located by the vacuole. FRAP and FLIP assays revealed that proteins in the IPOD are tightly packed, in-soluble and don't exchange with the cytosol. Amyloidogenic proteins, such as the Huntingtin protein, are the IPOD's substrates. Misfolded proteins must be non-ubiquitinated to be sorted to the IPOD. Ubiquitination of an otherwise IPOD substrate, such as the RNQ1 fungal prion, will result in its sequestration in the JUNQ inclusion. Upon accumulation of misfolded proteins, the disaggregase chaperone, AAA protein HSP104, localizes to the IPOD. It is yet to be determined if HSP104 functions in the IPOD or is simply sequestered there being hooked to a substrate. The pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) is localized by the IPOD. However, it wasn't shown that IPOD substrates are delivered to the vacuole, and so the link between the IPOD and autophagy is yet to be determined.

The resulting green part must later be sintered in a kiln. The compaction process permits an efficient production of parts to close tolerances with low drying shrinkage. It can be used for parts ranging widely in size and shape, and for both technical and nontechnical ceramics.  Background: traditional & advanced ceramics  The ceramics industry is broadly developed in the world. In Europe alone, the current investment is estimated at ‚Ç¨ 26 billion. Advanced ceramics are crucial for new technologies, particularly thermo-mechanical and bio-medical applications, while traditional ceramics have a worldwide market and have been suggested as materials to minimize the impact on the environment (when compared to other finishing materials).  The production process of ceramics  Up-to-date ceramic technology involves invention and design of new components and optimization of production processes of complex structures. Ceramics can be formed by a variety of different methods which can be divided into three main groups, depending on whether the starting materials involve a gas, a liquid, or a solid. Examples of methods involving gases are: chemical vapour deposition, directed metal oxidation and reaction bonding. Examples of methods involving liquids are: sol-gel process and polymer pyrolysis. Methods involving solids, especially powder methods, dominate ceramic forming and are extensively used in the industry. The practical realization of ceramic products by powder methods requires the following steps: ceramic powder production, powder treatment, handling and processing, cold forming, sintering, and evaluation of the performance of the final product. Since these processes permit an efficient production of parts ranging widely in size and shape to close tolerances, there is an evident interest in industry. For instance, metallurgical, pharmaceutical, and traditional and advanced structural ceramics represent common applications.  Mechanics of forming of ceramic powders  Fig. 1 A piece (formed with M KMS-96 alumina powder) has been broken after mold ejection.It is a well-established fact that the performance of a ceramic component critically depends on the manufacturing process. Initial powder characteristics and processing, including cold forming and sintering, have a strong impact on the mechanical properties of the components as they may generate a defect population (microcracks, density gradients, pores, agglomerates) within the green and sintered compounds. The mechanical characteristics of the solid obtained after cold forming (the so- called ‚Äògreen body‚Äô) strongly affect the subsequent sintering process and thus the mechanical properties of the final piece. Many technical, still unresolved difficulties arise in the forming process of ceramic materials. On the one hand the compact should result to be intact after ejection, it should be handleable without failure and essentially free of macro defects. On the other hand, defects of various nature are always present in the green bodies, negatively affecting local shrinkage during sintering, Fig. 1. Defects can be caused by the densification process, which may involve highly inhomogeneous strain fields, or by mold ejection. Currently, there is a high production rejection rate, due to the fact that manufacturing technologies are mainly based on empirically engineered processes, rather than on rational and scientific methodologies. Fig. 2 Micrographs of a M KMS-96 alumina powder. The loose state is shown on the left, while granule arrangements corresponding to Phases I and II of the compaction process are shown on the centre and on the right. Note the plastic deformation of grains visible on the right. The industrial technologies involved in the production of ceramics, with particular reference to tile and sanitaryware products, generate a huge amount of waste of material and energy.For the raw material grinding, big mills (with an installed power of up to a 1 MW) are used to reduce the particle size of the slip but the most power is lost just to increase the temperature of the slip itself. For the drying of the slip, big spray driers are used with up to 500 KW electrical power and 15.000.000 Kcal/h of thermal power : 80% of the thermal capacity of the machine is lost at the chimney with not a negligible percentage of the powder itself lost in the environment. For the forming of the powder, big presses (up to 7.500 ton of force and 250 KW of installed power) are used but only 5% of this energy is contained in the compacted final product. In the following step of drying and sintering, big burners with a consumption of 10.000.000 Kcal/h are used but most of the energy is wasted at the chimney. A big volume of waste glaze is also produced along the glazing line and only a little can be recycled in the plant itself. Even a small increase of the mechanical strength of the ceramic body would lead to a reduction in the weight of the ceramic article with a deepreduction of the above pollution effects. Consequently, the set-up of manufacturing processes is very costly and time consuming and not yet optimal in terms of quality of the final piece. There is therefore a strong interest from the ceramic industry in the availability of tools capable of modelling and simulating: i) the powder compaction process and ii) the criticality of defects possibly present in the final piece after sintering. Recently, an EU IAPP research project has been financed with the aim of enhance mechanical modelling of ceramic forming in view of industrial applications. During cold powder compaction, a granular material is made cohesive through mechanical densification, a process for which modelling requires the description of the transition from a granular to a dense and even a fully dense state (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 The hardening process during hydrostatic powder compaction described with the Bigoni & Piccolroaz yield surface.Since granular materials are characterized by mechanical properties almost completely different from those typical of dense solids, the mechanical modelling must describe a transition between two distinctly different states of a material.

Irvine House, also known as \\"The Locusts,\\" The Walker House, and The Kopf House, is a historic home located outside of Pine Grove Township, Warren County, Russell, Pennsylvania. The house design is Greek Revival in front (East face), and post-colonial/Pennsylvania Georgian in back. It was built between 1831 and 1835, and is a two-story, brick dwelling, with two-story flanking wings. It is five bays wide and two bays deep, with a gable roof. It features a pedimented porch supported by two columns. Note: This includes The foundation construction is 21\\" hand cut stone from a local quarry. The external and internal house walls are double brick. One unique feature is the \\"bridged\\" end chimneys. There were originally 14 fireplaces, with 11 remaining. There have been several fires, presumably isolated to the southern flanking wing. These were probably kitchen fires, possibly occurring around 1875 (3), 1890 and 1910. The grounds of the Irvine House still have many of the original Black Locust trees (Robinia pseudoacacia), which were either planted by Irvine, or were possibly existing as a locust grove prior to construction of the home. The wooden fence enclosing the front yard was rebuilt to original design in the early 1940s. The house and grounds are well documented in Charles Stotz book \\"The Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania\\".\\"The Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania\\", 1936, pp 30, 109, 136-139. Stotz noted that \\"The Locust\\" is one of only a few historic homes (pre-1860) in Western Pennsylvania that still retain some of its original landscaping. The house was designed by William Bell and built by William and John Thompson for business partners and friends, Guy Carrolton Irvine and Rufus Weatherby.\\"A History of Pine Grove Township, Warren County, PA\\". 1994. pp 212, 304. Guy and Rufus married sisters and traveled together extensively, so they initially designed the house to accommodate two families. However, during construction, Rufus Weatherby died (1833) and the house was finished for a single family. The Irvine House was part of the Irvine family until 1940, when it was purchased by the Walkers. The Walkers meticulously restored the house and grounds, retaining the original trees, rebuilding the fence and adding utilities for the first time. When the Walkers purchased the property there were several outbuilding; however all but the original outhouse were in poor condition and demolished. The original, two-stall brick outhouse was restored, and two brick outbuildings were added. The Locusts was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 13 September 1978. It is the only house in Pine Grove township listed on the National Register.

The company made a range of mountain bikes, but were best known at the time for their iconic turquoise colored FRO (For Racing Only) models.\\"THAT Was a Bike: 1988 Yeti FRO\\", Mar 4, 2014, Richard Cunningham, pinkbike.com Early sponsored riders included John Tomac, and Juli Furtado. In 1995, Schwinn bought Yeti Cycles company and later sold it to ski company Volant in 1999 (now part of Amer Sports). Revival In 2001, two Yeti employees, Steve Hoogendoorn and Chris Conroy, bought the company.\\"From The Top: Yeti Cycles' President Chris Conroy\\", May 2014, Mike Kazimer, pinkbike.com Conroy is currently the president and Hoogendoorn the vice president of Yeti Cycles. The company headquarters is now located in Golden, Colorado. Yeti Cycles competed in downhill mountain bike racing with the successful Lawwill DH-9 full- suspension downhill bike, developed by former motorcycle champion, Mert Lawwill. Yeti has a patented suspension system that they call ZeroLoss Technology or linear guide technology. The suspension system consists of two gliding pivots. The wheel path follows the direction of the impact so it transfers directly into the mountain bike suspension system and goes into the shock rather than flexing the frame. More recently, Yeti has patented a new suspension design called Switch Technology, which is basically a dual-link design that utilizes an eccentric mechanism that switches direction as the bike moves through its travel. This type of suspension is found on their 2012-2014 era mountain bikes, the SB-66, SB-75 and the SB-95. In 2014, Yeti introduced a refinement to the Switch Technology, dubbed Switch Infinity. This patented design was developed along with Fox Racing Shox and involves a 'translating pivot' which is said to improve the bike's rearward axle path. This rear suspension design change has been used on Yeti dual-suspension models, including the SB5, SB4.5, SB6, SB5.5, SB100, SB115, SB130, SB140, SB150 and SB165. Women specific bikes were introduced in 2015. Yeti Beti caters to women with smaller sized frames and lower standover height. Current Yeti/FOX Factory riders include Richie Rude, Duncan Nason, Shawn Neer and Jubal Davis. Yeti is also represented by a number of athletes and ambassadors throughout the world.

This subversion paved the way for the development of a fusion model of Hindu-Christian religion, free from European missionary interference and also inspired the Indian national movement, largely centred on Bengal and Madras Presidency to fight against Western-dominated institutionalized church leading to separation of Christ from Church and Indianization of Christianity: to express and interpret Christianity and Biblical text in Indian context, socially, culturally, and religiously. He was also the founder of indigenous Seventh Day sect on the outskirts of town Nazareth, Tamil Nadu, and was indirectly responsible for establishing the first Seventh-day Adventist church in South India ‚Äì Tamil Nadu. Biography He was educated at missionary schools run by Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG), an Anglican missionary society and also known by the name Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, presently known by the name United Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (USPG) from 1996. He was trained at a seminary run by SPG. He studied Hebrew and Greek languages, and was considered a great intellect, winning several prizes as a seminarian. He acquired the title Sattampillai, as a young man for being the monitor or classroom student leader, at the SPG seminary in Sawyerpuram. He worked in a missionary school and was associated with missionaries as a Catechist. He was a staunch Christian and acquired considerable knowledge of Christian history and Biblical literature‚Äîboth Old Testament and New Testament. Hindu church of Lord Jesus The monopoly and domination of Indian churches by Western missionaries grew larger when missionaries established a cordial relationship with the state -- British Raj or East India Company before. The effects of this Western dominance was felt not only in politics but also in the religious sphere, and European missionaries gradually started portraying Indian indigenous religious practices as inferior and targeted converts for alleged anti-white (European) sentiments. The Christian missionaries started establishment of their mission stations in Tinnevelly District (colonial British East India Company named it, present Tirunelveli district) of Tamil Nadu in the early 19th century. They established their mission stations‚Äîfirst at Mudalur, and followed by ones at Bethlehem and Nazareth, Tamil Nadu in Tinnevelly district. By 1803, a large number of Shanars (also known as Nadar) to the extent of more than 5000 Shanars were converted to Christianity in southeastern Tinnevelly. In addition to this, with growing opposition to Western colonialism in Asia, especially in India and China from the mid-19th century, the indigenous people perceived Western Christianity as the surrender to Colonialism and suspected Western Christianity in having de-nationalising influence. Not being comfortable with paternalistic and domineering mindset of SPG European missionaries, he looks to have had conflicts and disliked SPG missionaries like Augustus Frederick Caemmerer, a priest and author of Mission of Nazareth, in the District of Tinnevelly. Report for the Year 1845, and Robert Caldwell, an assistant bishop at Tirunelveli and evangelist. Suttampillai worked as catechist under Caemmerer, who was considered as an obnoxious missionary with a low opinion on indigenous converts. Suttampillai had conflicts with Caemmerer and Caldwell, both in theology and on the personal front; on the theological side, Suttampillai objected to the placing of the cross on the altar, which he considered as against the biblical injunction and interpreted as a sign of idolatry; on the personal side, anti- Western missionary feeling further fuelled when Robert Caldwell published The Tinnevelly Shanars, a quasi-ethnographical study of the Shanar community to which Sattampillai belongs; The study included some passages that deliberately disparaged Shanar community. For example, in Caldwell's view, they are the 'least intellectual people found in India', the majority of the community were marked by apathy, indifference, ignorance, and vice, and, again according to Caldwell, the religion followed by members of the Shanar community who were not yet converted was a 'school of immorality'. Under these circumstances and this context with the domineering mentality of Western missionaries against heathens, a desire arose in Arumainayagam Sattampillai to re-cast Christianity into a native and national social and cultural framework, to be interpreted as Hindu. It is also believed that, as Sattam Pillai was not willing to go by the British customary way of worship service, he started to garner like-minded believers and worship the Trinity in an Indian traditional way; accordingly, Sattampillai revolted against the Western superior mindset over Indian Christians, broke out from SPG, and established the \\"Hindu church of Lord Jesus\\", also known as \\"Indian church of the only Savior,\\" in 1857 at Prakasapuram (present Pragasapuram), Tirunelveli district. He established his new church, the Hindu church of Lord Jesus, with Hindu-Christian religion as its faith, to subvert the missionary authority and denounced Western Christianity as corrupt and inauthentic‚Äîhe interpreted Hindu as a geographical term (living across Indus river and/or in social and cultural context), rather than in a religious context; furthermore, he looks to have interpreted the Hindu customs as Indian customs. Over the period, the converted Christians in India started to interpret and express Christianity by employing their innate social, religious, and cultural categories. The year 1857 is significant, as uprising against the British Raj was already occurring in Northern India as part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Suttampillai revolted against Western dominance in Indian churches using a two-fold strategy; one, by separating Christ from Church and accommodating native traditions and customs into Christianity, he succeeded in undermining the authority of Western missionaries; two, he appropriated Hebrew scriptures and Jewish customs into the Church supporting the Old Testament rather than New Testament as an antidote against the Western missionaries who were moving towards a New Testament focus with British Raj support. The church rejected from their system everything that they perceived as having a savour of a European origin. They cut completely from all European help in money and influence, as if there were no longer any Europeans in the country. Sattampillai also seems to have claimed that Hindu cultural practices are similar to the Jewish cultural practices. His interpretations and inclusive approach made him incorporate (accommodate) \\"presumed Indian cultures as Hindu culture\\" into his movement such as prostration, sacrifice, use of frankincense, folding their hands while praying to deities, using unfermented grape juice instead of wine, and sitting on the floor. In the rituals of the Church, Old Testament ritualistic practices such as \\"ritual impurities attributed to women\\" were also practised in this church, as similar practices were also found in Indian (Hindu) religious rituals. Unlike the Anglican church use of bells, they use a trumpet. A trumpet blast from the church tower summons the faithful to worship, and followers wash their hands and feet before entering the sanctuary, where they punctuate the service with bodily prostration. The worship is usually held on Saturday Sabbath. People belonging to this church don't work on Saturday. Food for Saturday is made before 6 pm on Friday. They use Jewish calendar to celebrate feast days as followed in Old Testament days. He denied the efficacy of infant baptism and abandoned the idea of an ordained ministry, declaring that \\"anyone might become a minister of the Gospel.\\" Apologetics against Western Christianity He was strongly against the Western missionary Christianity and directed his apologetics to exposing their decadence, sexual immorality, and materialism that was rampant among Westerners, both in India and Europe. He cited the works of John Parker, William Howitt, Robert Southey, and Abbe Dubois that spoke of the savage nature of Saxons, their extravagant indulgence, drunken behaviour, polygamous marriage practices, and the rampant prostitution in western capitals. He not only attacked the lifestyle of Europeans, but denounced Europeans as immoral, depraved, and whorish. In a series of tracts written by Sattampillai, he tried to impose strict discipline to make his community above reproach, and consistently disparaged Europeans (mostly English people, but could also be meant to include Americans and Continentals) for their lax sexual morality and lack of control over women. He was severe on divorce and re-marriage, especially of offspring of such unions: in his view, Holy Church and the country was greatly polluted by admitting such despicable families procreating culpable offspring into the church communion. He loathed the European woman, who once married to one man was able to remarry subsequent to divorce or widowhood; Sattampillai objected to this as a total violation to the laws laid out in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Sattampillai also wrote that Europeans strayed from the true path, after Roman kings like Constantine and Theodorus converted to Christianity and introduced their own immoral rules regarding marriage into the laws of the Holy Church. Sattampillai preached that Jesus did not intend for Christians to abandon the laws given in the Hebrew Bible. According to Sattampillai, this is one among several of moral lapses and transgressions by European Christians. Sattampillai sought to correct the distortions wrought on the original form of Christianity by European Christians by returning to the laws of the Hebrew Bible. The Tinnevelly Shanars controversy Robert Caldwell in his derisive comments on Shanars using The Tinnevelly Shanars publication is said to have commented that \\"Shanar have no caste to raise, and they are conscious that were it not for the protection of the Missionaries and of Christianity, their condition would be deplorable.\\". Caldwell argued that Shanars could be considered Hindus only to the extent that \\"Hindu\\" was a geographical category that included \\"any class in India.\\" The controversy initiated by Sattampillai over The Tinnevelly Shanars again was resuscitated in 1880 when Y. Gnanamuthoo Nadar (a Tamil Christian clerk in the Tirunelveli courts, antiquarian and representative of the Shanar race, son of the first Indian catechists in SPG in Nazareth area, and a former catechist of CMS) petitioned the colonial British government and missionary ecclesiastical structure, demanding that the British censure Caldwell and remove the offending book from its publication. Gnanamuthoo continued his fight with SPG missionaries, demanding they retract their slanderous statements about their caste and including disrupting the bishops when they travelled to villages to convert between 1880 and 1885. According to Gnanamuthoo, many of the Nadar christians either reverted to Hinduism or joined the Hindu Christian church founded by Sattampillai in 1857 out of anger. Gnanamuthoo also wrote: With the impetus provided by the A.N. Sattampillai movement in revolting against Western church, educated Nadars (also known as Shanar), having got The Tinnevelly Shanars publication several years earlier, became furious and protested against Caldwell, demanding the removal of The Tinnevelly Shanars from publication. As part of this effort, Nadars produced a series of arguments to substantiate their claims against Caldwell's portrayal of Shanars, took a form of street corner oratory, published pamphlets, and in early 1880 filed an official petition to the British Raj in the Madras Presidency to retract the odious Tinnevelly Shanars publication and censure Robert Caldwell. Caldwell looks to have partly retracted his statements, especially his evaluation that Shanars were \\"not Hindus,\\" in a letter that was printed in the CMS Record of February 1880. =Hardgrave's hypothesis= Sattampillai's activism was centred on the rejection of Western manners and customs. His writings reveal how vehemently some Indian Christians rejected the ideas of civilisation and moral progress embedded in the prevailing colonial model of conversion as a series of stages. It is believed that he was dismissed for allegedly having remarked on foreign missionaries. Robert L. Hardgrave, an author of The Nadars of Tamilnadu, Portrait of the Hindus: Balthazar Solvyns & the European image of India, 1760‚Äì1824, Boats of Bengal: eighteenth century portraits, The Dravidian movement, and several other similar works, has hypothesized that Sattampillai, disgruntled for having been dismissed as a catechist, had somehow discovered Robert Caldwell's pamphlets with disdainful comments on the Shanar caste. Hardgrave believes that Sattampillai, who was supposed to visit Madras in 1850 to plead for his reinstatement with the SPG Corresponding committee, could have discovered Caldwell's pamphlets that ultimately instigated him to resent and revolt against European missionaries during that time. Seventh-day Adventist Church Sattampillai, founder of the indigenous Seventh Day sect at the Nazareth town in Tamil Nadu, received a copy of a booklet containing a lecture delivered by the Seventh Day Baptist representative at the World's Parliament of Religions, which brought representatives from different religious backgrounds together in order to bring forth truths and commonalities across various religions. It was held in 1893 in Chicago, United States. Sattampillai, having believed that it was only the Jews who observed the seventh day as Sabbath, sent a letter to New York with curiosity to know more about the Sabbath. However, the letter reached a Seventh-day Adventist office in Battle Creek, Michigan; hence, F. M. Woolcox sent him a few books and magazines in a reply. In 1906, J.S. James from Minnesota was chosen to work in South India; accordingly, he was sent as an Adventist missionary to Bangalore with his wife and two sons. James, having learnt the Tamil language, translated a few pamphlets into Tamil, such as \\"Is the end of the world near?\\", \\"Which day is Sabbath?\\", \\"The signs of Christ's second coming\\", and \\"New Testament Sabbath\\". Sattampillai, having received and studied them, sought more explanation about them. In 1908, James along with G. F. Enoch and J. L. Shaw visited Tirunelveli by train and reached Nazareth by bullock- cart;they were received with awesome ceremonial celebrations participated in by people in the hundreds, including women and children from Hindu Yeka Ratchahar church. They were accommodated for ten days in a local school and on 2 July 1908, the Church donated two acres of land worth 1000 rupees to James, marking the beginning of the Seventh-day Adventist presence there, as James decided to quit Bangalore and stay in Prakasapuram (also spelt Pragasapuram), an adjoining village to Mukuperi. The first church of Seventh-day Adventists in South India was formally organised with 50 members on 30 January 1915 in Prakasapuram, although, it was in fact functioning as early as 1908. James and C.G. Lowry conducted the religious service. Later, the Adventist Church also started an educational institution with the name James Memorial School in Prakasapuram.

He painted a portrait of Thomas Haswell, a North Shields songwriter.  Brief details  Shotton was born in North Shields in 1824. He showed a talent for drawing from an early age and later attended the Royal Academy Schools, where he became a friend of William Holman Hunt. When his father died he returned to North Shields. In 1857, he designed what is thought to be the first Victorian Turkish bath in England at Tyneside House, home of local ironmaster George Crawshay, who had just returned from seeing the first Victorian Turkish bath in the British Isles being built at Blarney, near Cork in Ireland. In 1869, Shotton designed the Cecil Street Turkish Baths in North Shields, in which Crawshay had shares, and followed this in 1874 by designing one in Pilgrim Street for the Turkish Bath Company Limited. After the earlier resumption of his artistic studies, he gained quite a reputation being accepted by the Royal Academy in 1863. He was a member of the Cullercoats Artists' Colony, and he rarely exhibited his work, but was well regarded as a portrait painter, twice painting Wesley Stoker Barker Woolhouse (the noted North Shields mathematician), one version of which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1863; and also James Edington.

He established British North America's largest wholesale hardware house, Frothingham & Workman. He was President of the City Bank of Montreal from 1834 to 1849, and a generous contributor to Queen's University, McGill University and Montreal's Protestant schools. The house he purchased in the 1830s, Piedmont (demolished in 1939), was one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile. In 1890, its ten acres of grounds were purchased for $86,000 by Lords Strathcona and Mount Stephen, on which they built the Royal Victoria Hospital. Early life Label from the Hardware House of Frothingham & Workman In 1788, Frothingham was born at Portland, Maine. He was the son of The Hon. John Frothingham (1749-1826), a graduate of Harvard University who became a Judge of the Superior Court of Massachusetts and kept a summer house at Portland. His mother, Martha (1763-1834), was the daughter of Samuel May (1723‚Äì1794), a prominent merchant of Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was a first cousin of Samuel Joseph May. From an early age, John was employed in his uncle's, Samuel May's, hardware firm in Boston. In 1809, he was sent to Montreal to open a branch there. Following the War of 1812, Americans tended to be discriminated against both socially and in business, and he suffered a few early setbacks. However, Frothingham re-established himself by setting up his own hardware business in partnership with his younger brother, Joseph May Frothingham, who died in 1832. In 1836, Frothingham went into partnership with William Workman, and their firm became the largest hardware and iron wholesale house in British North America. By 1853, Frothingham & Workman had moved to larger premises and started to manufacture some of their own merchandise. Life in Montreal City Bank, Montreal. Frothingham was President from 1834 to 1849 Piedmont House, home to the Frothinghams from the early 1830s to 1910 Mrs Louisa (Frothingham) Molson Frothingham promoted and invested in a wide variety of business interests that were being formed during the expansion of Montreal in the 1840s. Among others, these included, Montreal Board of Trade, the St Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad, the Montreal Stock Exchange and the Canada Inland Steam Navigation Company. He was also associated with the British and Canadian School of Montreal and the Montreal Horticultural Society. His principal business interest outside of his hardware firm was the City Bank of Montreal. Founded in 1831, it was the only bank since 1817 to have successfully broken the financial monopoly held by the Bank of Montreal. The initial capital had been supplied by investors from New York and Frothingham was associated with the bank from its origins, along with several other prominent Montrealers, who in opposition to the Scots-Quebecers were almost all English Canadian, French Canadian or American. Frothingham held a substantial quantity of the bank‚Äôs stock and he was a director of the bank for about sixteen years, before serving as the bank's President from 1834 to 1849. He resigned in 1849 after the bank sustained heavy losses and was succeeded by his close friend and business partner, William Workman. Frothingham took no interest in politics. Family and last years In 1816, at Brookline, Massachusetts, Frothingham married his first cousin, Louisa Goddard Archibald (1794‚Äì1843), daughter of Azor Gale Archibald (1763‚Äì1810) and Lucretia May (1765‚Äì1811). They were the parents of seven children, but the four eldest all died young. The three surviving children of the Frothinghams were: *George Henry Frothingham (1823‚Äì1875), of Montreal. He joined his father's business and in 1844 married Louisa Davenport Hayward (1826-1876), daughter of Joseph Henshaw Hayward (1789-1853), of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and his wife Mary May Davenport. *Frederick Frothingham (1825‚Äì1891), of Milton, Massachusetts. Educated at Harvard University, at Greenfield, Massachusetts in 1872, he married Lois Ripley Wright (1833‚Äì1900), of Lowell, Massachusetts. *Louisa Goddard Frothingham (1827‚Äì1910). After her mother's death in 1843, she vowed to stay with her father at Piedmont as his companion and housekeeper for as long as he may live. Her eventual husband, John Henry Robinson Molson, son of Thomas Molson of Montreal, had to wait thirty years before he could marry her, by which time she was too old to have children. They continued to live at Piedmont and she worked closely with the Montreal Protestant Orphan Asylum and helped pioneer the cause for higher education for women. Among many other charitable bequests, she gave over $120,000 to the Protestant Hospital for the Insane; $240,000 to the Montreal General Hospital and $100,000 to the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning. In the early 1830s, Frothingham had purchased Piedmont House from Louis-Charles Foucher, one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile. The house stood among orchards and formal gardens and was approached by a long tree-lined drive. He purchased the house in the hope that the country air would cure his ailing wife.The Square Mile - Merchant Princes of Montreal (1987), Donald MacKay When Parliament met during the winter at Montreal, Piedmont had been used as the Governor Generals residence. The house was situated on the McGill University campus and was demolished in 1939. Having retired from business in 1859, Frothingham lived quietly at Piedmont. Frothingham was a Presbyterian and a generous contributor to Queen's University, McGill University and Montreal's Protestant schools. His papers and diaries are kept at the University of Toronto.

It was first published in the May 5, 1980, issue of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, and reprinted in Banquets of the Black Widowers (1984) and The Return of the Black Widowers (2003). Asimov originally entitled it \\"Fourteen Letters\\", but the magazine's title was kept in subsequent uses of the story.\\"Afterword\\" to \\"Sixty Million Trillion Combinations\\" The story is one of a collection of short mysteries whose characters are based loosely upon the Trap Door Spiders, a stag-club of which Asimov was a member.  Plot summary  Each month, the seven men who comprise the Black Widowers (six who dine, and the waiter who attends them) meet at a fine restaurant and converse over dinner with each other, their guest, and their waiter, Henry. The host of the group ‚Äî that is, the member who pays for everyone else's dinner that month ‚Äî usually brings a guest for the evening, who will then be \\"grilled,\\" or questioned, when dessert has been finished and supper has reached the brandy stage. This occasion is different, for Thomas Trumbull, one of the members, wants to present to the others a problem that he faces at work. Trumbull works for the U.S. government in a mysterious capacity; it is known, though, that he is involved in cryptanalysis. As usual, the Black Widowers have discussed, during the pre-supper cocktails, a matter that will appear important later: the apparently unimportant subject of alliteration, or, to be more precise, first letters. Trumbull explains that his department is concerned with the important computations and, subsequently, with the paranoia of a mathematician, Vladimir Pochik, who suspects that his work on Goldbach's conjecture has been stolen. Trumbull also confesses that he feels rather as though he is in the position of the Chaldean wise men facing Nebuchadnezzar II. By this, he means that, instead of solving a known cryptogram, he must figure out what the cryptogram is. Pochik, a former restaurant waiter (like Henry), had proven to be a brilliant mathematician. He had been happily working with the authorities until another mathematician, Sandino, became his rival, and an insulting, harassing rival at that - always teasing Pochik about having started work as a waiter, for instance. To Pochik's vast dismay, Sandino publishes an article showing the same work that Pochik had made, and Pochik is certain that Sandino stole the work. At that point, Pochik retires to his room and reads only poetry, especially the poetry of William Wordsworth. When the authorities demand his cooperation, Pochik sulkily gives a clue to the code which protected his work on a shared computer; he had been certain that no one could possibly guess or deduce the code, which is made up of fourteen letters. The Black Widowers suggest various groups of fourteen letters, such as VLADIMIR POCHIK and SIR ISAAC NEWTON, which might provide the clue, and which Sandino might easily have thought of in order to break into the computer and steal Pochik's work. But Trumbull takes out his pocket computer and computes, gloomily, that there are about 64 million trillion different possibilities for the code word, beginning with AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. The Black Widowers are able to come up with the code, purely because one member shares a trait with the mathematician. That member is Henry, the waiter, who focused on the fact that Pochik was reading Wordsworth. He suggests fourteen letters to Trumbull (W, E, A, L, T, M, D, I, T, E, B, I, A, T) - and Trumbull leaps up and telephones Pochik, and discovers that Henry was right. But how did Henry know? Henry explains that the number 14 suggested to him the number of lines in a sonnet. He recalled that a famous Wordsworth poem refers to the English poet John Milton, whose sonnet On His Blindness concludes with the famous line, \\"They also serve who only stand and wait.\\" As a waiter, Henry felt sympathy for Pochik. The fourteen letters are the first letters of each line of the sonnet, which thus returns us to the earlier conversation about alliteration.

One of her most beloved performances was as Aunt Szabo in the radio soap opera The Szabo Family. A resistance member during World War II, she attempted to facilitate the reconstruction of the National Theatre by sponsoring a fundraising drive. Committed to her craft, she founded the √Årp√°d Horv√°th Actor's College (1947), a home to care for elderly actors named after Mari J√°szai (1948), a second actor's home named after (1950), the (1952), and bequeathed her Patk√≥ Villa to the National Theater for the purposes of creating a theater. Early life Hilda Em√≠lia Gizella Gobbi was born on 6 June 1913 in Budapest, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to German-born, Margit (n√©e Schneckenburger) and the Italian Hussar-turned industrialist, Ede Gobbi. Her paternal grandfather was Alois Gobbi, a noted violinist, who would later become the conductor of the National Conservatory. When she was a child, her family was well-to-do, as her father ran a paper-towel factory, but they became impoverished due to his gambling and spending money on other women. For a time, the couple separated and Gobbi and her mother were homeless. Gobbi attended the and then attended the Putnoki School of Economics for Women's Higher Education (). Going on to university, she enrolled in botany classes at the P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University, and worked in the university's botanical garden. To continue her education, Gobbi was able to secure loans and enter the National Theater Academy as a scholarship student, attending from 1932 to 1935. Career Upon completing her studies at the Academy, Gobbi was contracted with the National Theater in 1935 and began participating in many productions. She was a featured artist in the productions of the Vasas Trade Union. Gobbi's first film role was in The Borrowed Castle (, 1937) and the following year, she filmed The Lady Is a Bit Cracked (, 1938), in which she played an eccentric madwoman. Even in her younger days as an actress, Gobbi earned her reputation by playing older women. During the Nazi occupation of Hungary, Gobbi worked with the Resistance. Her father created forged documents to exempt men from military service, which Gobbi distributed. Gobbi was politically active and a member of the communist party until 1956, when she left over ideological differences; she felt the party had abandoned the people. Remembering her early struggles and time of homelessness, Gobbi had a strong social conscience and was involved in creating many organizations to assist actors. In 1947, she founded the √Årp√°d Horv√°th Actor's College to give aspiring actors a home and place to study. was an early actor and theater director. The following year, she created the Mari J√°szai Actress Home and then in 1949, established the √ìdry √Årp√°d Actors Home, to provide a homes to care for elderly performers. During her early years of struggling, Gizi Bajor, who served as a mentor, had once given her shoes. After the actress's untimely death, Gobbi purchased Bajor's villa and created a museum named in her honor to feature Hungarian performers in 1952. Besides Bajor, there are rooms at the museum dedicated to Marian J√°szai and Em√≠lia M√°rkus. After the 1959 theatrical season ended, Gobbi quit the National Theater and began working in 1960 at the J√≥zsef Attila Theatre. At a time when homosexuality was illegal, Gobbi was open about her lesbian orientation, often dressing in men's clothing. After H√©di Temessy divorced her husband, she began a relationship with Gobbi and they lived together from the late 1950s to 1960s in a home in Buda. Homosexuality was no longer a crime after 1961 but was classified as a mental illness. After Gobbi and Temessy ended their relationship, Gobbi became the partner of the writer, Erzs√©bet Galg√≥czi. In 1971, she rejoined the National Theater and remained here until 1982. In that year, she moved to the J√≥zsef Katona Theater, where she performed until her death. When she received a monetary prize for her 70th birthday in 1983, Gobbi offered the entire prize money to refurbish the National Theater. She launched a nationwide fundraising drive which garnered collections of 3.3 billion forints, but the theater was never constructed and there were accusations of governmental misuse of the funds. Gobbi performed on film, radio and stage, in a career which spanned over fifty years. She was a versatile actor and did not shy away from performing characters who were complex. She performed in a wide range of productions from comedy to tragedy, and was noted for her humor and caricatures, creating many memorable roles. Some of her most noted performances were as Gertrude in J√≥zsef Katona's B√°nk b√°n; as Gertrud in Shakespeare's Hamlet, in the title role of Mih√°ly Csokonai Vit√©z's Karny√≥n√©, as Sagittarius Misi in Zsigmond M√≥ricz's L√©gy j√≥ mindhal√°lig (Be faithful until death), as Rizi in Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny's Pisti a v√©rzivatarban (Pisti in the bloodstream), the mother in Gy√∂rgy Schwajda's A szent csal√°d (The holy family) and the old woman in Gy√∂rgy Spir√≥'s Csirkefej (Chicken Head). Her role as Aunt Szab√≥ in the Hungarian radio soap opera, The Szab√≥ Family, was one of her most popular performances, as was the performance in Mickey Magnate (, 1949) in which she played an aristocratic old woman who was a kleptomaniac. In 1982, Gobbi published her autobiography, K√∂zben--, which was released by Sz√©pirodalmi Kiad√≥. Awarded numerous honors for her performance, Gobbi received the: \\"Wolf Ratko Prize (1941), the Kossuth Prize (1949), Artist of Merit (1950), Outstanding Artist (1955), the Labor Merit Gold Grade (1973), SZOT Prize (1977), Order of the Flag of the Republic of Hungary (1983), and The Order of the Enlightened Flag of the Hungarian People's Republic (1988)\\". Death and legacy Statue of Hilda Gobbi outside of the National Theatre. Gobbi died on 13 July 1988 in Budapest. As she had no living relatives, per the terms of her will, she left her estate to the National Theater with instructions to sell her home in Buda and use two-thirds of the proceeds to set up a prize named the Aase Award, after the mother in Peer Gynt, to make an annual award to the season's best theater production. The other third was to provide an actors' assistance fund. For her centennial birth date, numerous tributes were held throughout Budapest. She also left the National Theater her Patk√≥ Villa vacation home in Visegr√°d to create a theater venue in that city. The villa was never converted and in 2017, controversy surrounded the issue, as the property had been left to decay. The Hungarian Theater in Pest took over the project from the National Theater in 2016 with the intent to complete the project; however, by April 2017, no work had been done.

One of her important works is an autobiography about her emigration from Nazi Germany to the US.  Life  Barschak was a leaned typist and bookkeeper and worked in this position for 6 years, until she received a diploma in the field of business education. In 1915 Barschak completed the German Abitur which allowed her to go on to university, where she studied economics, sociology and psychology in Berlin and T√ºbingen.Christine von Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung ‚Äì Zur transnationalen Vernetzung von Akademikerinnen 1917‚Äì1955 G√∂ttingen 2012, biographical appendix. Also the following. Throughout her studies Barschak was a teacher at evening schools and after being awarded a doctorate in 1912, she moved on to work as a teacher at the public college for business and economics in Berlin as well as at the Pestalozzi-Fr√∂bel-Haus, known as a social center and school for sociology as well as women's education. During this time Barschak frequently published articles in socio-scientific journals, for example the weekly paper \\"Social Practice\\" (Soziale Praxis) published by Susanne Charlotte Engelmann.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 308. In 1930 Barschak became a professor at the public institute for teaching vocational education in Berlin, she was however removed from this post in 1933 following the rise to power of the Nazi party in Germany. Barschak was able to leave Berlin and move to London and Genf to study psychology,Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 308. which spared her the experience of career stagnation, as well as further occupational and private reprimands. However Barschak returned in 1935, while the Nazis were still in power, for an involvement in the Jewish educational system. She taught psychology and pedagogy at the Jewish academy for the education of teachers in Berlin and was actively involved in the preparation for emigration within the education system. This work, which she organised together with Fritz Bamberger, erroneously associated Barschak with Zionism.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 308. In September 1939, notably the month of the invasion of Poland by the Nazis and thus marking the beginning of World War II, Barschak began to prepare her emigration by getting into contact with people she was associated with.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 308. In 1940 she reached the US via Great Britain and with the help of the American Association of University Women (AAUW), secured a place as a Refugee Scholar at the Wilson College in Pennsylvania for the academic year 1941/42, a position that a year later would be transferred to Susanne Charlotte Engelmann.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 333. Similar to Susanne Charlotte Engelmanns experience, this job opened up a way into academia which fortunately saved the career aspirations of the two women.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 326. Hence Erna Barschak subsequently became a professor for psychology at the Miami University in Ohio.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 333. After her emigration to the US, Barschak published an autobiography which collect her experiences as an immigrant.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p. 320f. Also the following. She illustrates a variety of problems for academic war refugees, especially within the new and unfamiliar work environment. For example she describes the utopian and unrealistic idea, to be able to instantly continue their occupational career in the new home country.

Education  Engelmann was born in Berlin on 26 September 1886. At the turn of the 20th century Engelmann finished her secondary education at an all-girls school there and in 1905 completed her Abitur at the private secondary school established by Helene Lange.Christine von Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung - Zur transnationalen Vernetzung von Akademikerinnen 1917-1955 G√∂ttingen 2012, biographical appendix. Engelmann attended university in Berlin and Heidelberg, where she studied a range of subjects including German, English studies, psychology, and pedagogy. She finished her studies in 1909 with a dissertation on \\"the influence of the folk song on the lyric poetry of the liberation wars\\", (\\"Einfluss des Volksliedes auf die Lyrik der Befreiungskriege\\"). In 1910 she completed the German teaching accreditation examination and spent that year as a preparatory year at various schools for girls in Berlin. In 1912 she received a licence to teach in secondary schools in Prussia. Engelmann spent the academic year 1913-14 as a German scholar at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in the United States. She made professionals contacts at the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and developed her knowledge of the country and the language that later helped her successful immigration and settlement in the U.S. when the rise of National Socialism in Germany forced her to emigrate.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.325.  Work  After her stay in the U.S., Engelmann worked as a teacher (Studienrat) for 12 years until she became the director of a secondary school and in 1928 worked as the director of the Viktoria-Oberlyzeum, the first all-girls school in Berlin to offer the Abitur, the examination that marks the end of pre- college education.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.303. Engelmann was an important pedagogue during the Weimar Republic working in the field of female education. She published numerous scientific works on this subjectRenate Heuer, Bibliograpfia Judaica ‚Äì Verzeichnis j√ºdischer Autoren deutscher Sprache, Bd.1, M√ºnchen 1981, S.385. and throughout her life worked in teaching or researching education and educational systems. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, teachers who had a Jewish background, as Engelmann did, were increasingly put under pressure and eventually left the profession. After Engelmann was forced to retire, she contacted Esther Brunauer at the American Association of University Women in Washington.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.303. While exploring the possibility of emigration, Engelmann worked as a private teacher of literature, psychology and pedagogy. She was unhappy with the way her career was going but did not want to emigrate without first securing a university position.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.304. Unlike most other people who were forced out of her jobs, Engelmann received a small pension, and she lived with her mother, Martha Engelmann, who depended on her income.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.304. Beginning in 1935, Engelmann headed the department of adult education at the Berliner Paulus- Bund, a position for which she qualified based on her status as a Protestant and a member of the Confessing Church headed by Martin Niem√∂ller in Berlin.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.310. In 1937 she was removed from the post upon the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws. Engelmann then intensified her efforts to emigrate, especially in her correspondence with the AAUW.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.311. Her brother helped Engelmann and their mother to flee Germany and join him in Turkey, where he worked for the Turkish Ministry of Economics. Engelmann lived in Istanbul and worked for the American Social Service Center, where she taught educational psychology.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, biographical appendix. Her mother in June 1940 and Engelmann traveled through Russia, Siberia, Manchuria, and Japan, reaching the U.S. in 1941. She entered the academic field through the help of the American Association of University Women, which placed her as a Refugee Scholar at Wilson College in Pennsylvania for the academic year 1942-43.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.292. She held several academic posts over the next several years and in 1947 held her first professorship at the Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she worked until her retirement in 1952.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.334. Engelmann became an American citizen in 1948. In 1952, she returned to Berlin and received financial compensation for the pension due her but unpaid following her forced retirement in 1933.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, biographical appendix. Some believe her ties to the congregation in Dahlem also led her to return.Oertzen, Strategie Verst√§ndigung, p.338. Another possible attraction was the reconstruction of the German education system. Her later publications were increasingly concerned with the German education system of the 1930s and especially the methods of indoctrination endorsed by the National Socialists.Heuer, Bibliograpfia Judaica, p.385.

He became a major publisher of chapbooks in the Seven Dials district of London.  Early life  James Catnach was born in Alnwick on 18 August 1792. He received an education under a Mr Goldie, but his interest in learning was minimal and his attendance spasmodic. In his youth he seemed to spend much of his time as a shepherd.  His father‚Äôs business  His father John Catnach, a printer, had been declared bankrupt in 1801. This fact, together with details of the asset sale was advertised in a hand-bill, a rare copy of which is now in the National Library of Scotland. Father managed to restart the business and in 1807 he took on two apprentices, one being his son James, and another was a lad named Mark Smith, (see later); a few months afterwards John entered into partnership with William Davison to form Catnach and Davison. Unfortunately this partnership did not appear to work, as it lasted less than two years, after which it was dissolved. John Catnach then moved to Newcastle in 1808, taking a small shop in Newgate Street in which to restart his business.. He made some unfortunate decisions, and the result of these plus his own irregular habits (and drinking) and the way he ran his business, caused him to get into debt, until eventually he became a bankrupt and as such ended up in a debtors' prison. He had managed to send his wife and family to London together with a small wooden printing press, some type etc. and other small items which they managed to secrete away. Once in London in 1812, the family moved into lodgings in a court off Drury Lane, where they were joined by John in 1812 on his release, but the accommodation was to prove temporary. Very shortly after, they were evicted and moved firstly to a small shop in Wardour Street, Soho (while living in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square), followed by another move to Gerard Street, where, after falling down stairs on 29 August 1813, John Catnach was taken to St George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, where he died on 4 December 1813. Family re-united  James Catnach who had been working in Newcastle upon Tyne, joined the family several weeks after his father's death, and shortly after this, the family again moved. It was from the little shop and parlour at 2 Monmouth Court, Seven Dials that James Catnach set up his printing business c. 1813 using only his father's old wooden printing press. He was now supporting his mother and family and so had even more incentive to succeed, and so by very careful management he gradually built up a very solid yet lucrative business. His main-stay was small histories, ballad poetry, broadsides, catch-pennies, and penny awfuls. And the customers who were connected with the catchpenny trade and who frequented his place of business were, in the main, vagrants, miscreants, and the underclasses of society. After the Napoleonic war, many printers cashed in on the public's demand for news and printed small penny papers, each with a topical story. In 1818 James Catnach printed an edition on a small sheet in which he suggested that certain local butchers in Drury Lane had received two human bodies which they intended to sell as pork. In the ensuing court case he eventually pleaded guilty and was sent to Clerkenwell Prison for 6 months, during which time his mother and sisters manned the presses. Business improved and c. 1820 James was running 3 presses, all working flat out. By the end of the 1830s James Catnach was at the height of his power, influence and wealth, never employing more than 4 and with only 6 presses, he had a phenomenal turnover, sometimes not even having time to count the number of copies coming of the presses.  Retirement and early death  James Catnach retired in 1838 to a property which he had bought in preparation for this event. It consisted of the \\"Lion Inn\\", a disused public house and its grounds at Dancer's Hill, South Mimms, near Barnet in Middlesex, leaving the business to his sister (now) Mrs. Anne (baptised Nancy) Ryle. He never married and kept his Northumberland burr. He did not long survive his retirement and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, in one of the two plots that his sister had purchased earlier. The official number of the grave is 256, Square 29, over which is placed a flat stone, inscribed : ‚Äî IN MEMORY OF JAMES CATNACH, Of Dancer's Hill. DIED 1 February 1841, Aged 49. He left somewhere between ¬£3,000 and ¬£10,000 depending upon which story you want to believe.  Mark Smith  When the two partners, John Catnach and William Davison dissolved the partnership, the indentures on son James Catnach and the lad Mark Smith became void, and they afterwards worked together as \\"improvers\\" in their trade with Mr Joseph Graham, a printer from Fenkle Street in Alnwick. Mark Smith moved away to London and later, on learning that the family had arrived there, went to visit them at their lodgings in a court off Drury Lane. There he helped to set up the press in readiness for John Catnach's freeing from prison. He kept in touch, helped out the family by providing firstly utensils, later paying off the rent arrears and whilst John was in hospital, by working at night-time to finish off the jobs on his books. James Catnach kept in touch with Mark and visited him in Alnwick on more than one occasion.  Works  These include: One class of literature which Jemmy Catnach made almost his own, was children's farthing and halfpenny books. Among these are: ** The Tragical Death of an Apple Pie ** The House that Jack Built ** Jumping Joan ** The Butterflys' Ball and Grasshoppers' Feast ** Jerry Diddle and his Fiddle ** Nurse Love-Child's Gift ** The Death and Burial of Cock Robin ** The Cries of London ** Simple Simon ** Jacky Jingle and Suky Shingle ** He advertised them as \\"Here you have just printed and published, and adorned with ten beautiful and elegantly engraved embellishments, and for the low charge of one farden ‚Äì Yes ! one farden buys\\" (A farding is an obsolete or dialectal form of the word farthing) * The story of the Battle of Waterloo ‚Äî (this last and 16th of the decisive battles at which Napoleon was finally overthrown, and took place i8 June 1815) * Old Songs and Ballads.‚Äî A Collection of 35 most Curious Old Songs and Ballads, printed at Seven Dials, on rough old straw paper, and illustrated with quaint and rude woodcuts or engravings * He also wrote many verses and songs, most of which he also printed on broadsides and chapbooks. * In the British Museum there is a collection of upwards of 4,000 ballads in two folio volumes ‚Äì all printed by James Catnach * St Bride Library, Fleet Street, holds a substantial collection of broadsides and ballads, printed by Catnach and his successor William Fortey.

As well as helping film workers in times of need, it provides support to various organizations including the Mowelfund Film Institute. History Mowelfund is a non-stock, non-profit social welfare, educational and industry development foundation established in 1974 by Joseph Estrada, at that time Mayor of San Juan and President of the Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association. In addition to supporting the welfare of movie industry workers, Mowelfund reorganized the Board of Censors to become the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board and created the Film Academy of the Philippines. Mowelfund handled the Metro Manila Film Festival until the People Power Revolution in 1986, when the government assumed responsibility. In December 2011 Francis Tolentino, chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, expressed support for transferring responsibility for the festival back to private industry. Activities With about 4,500 members, Mowelfund provides financial support for hospitalization, surgery, medical fees and death benefits, and helps with housing and employment. The foundation maintains an archive of old Filipino movies. A museum was opened in 2005 in the Mowelfund headquarters, which are in a quiet part of Quezon City. The museum is run on a shoestring budget, and can be visited only through arrangement. Working with the Film Development Council of the Philippines, the Mowelfund Film Institute holds Intensive Filmmaking Workshops twice a year. These have helped many aspiring young Filipino filmmakers who are now active internationally. Mowelfund also campaigns against film and video piracy. Fundraising In March 2011 Mowelfund celebrated its 37th anniversary at the Mowelfund Plaza in Quezon city. Former president and founder Joseph \\"Erap\\" Estrada was a guest of honor. The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and the Mowelfund sweepstakes partnership were launched at the event. Through the partnership, Mowelfund beneficiaries could become dealers or agents of sweepstakes tickets, thus providing a livelihood. In June 2011 Mowelfund organized a fundraising concert at the Cultural Center of the Philippines to celebrate the 92nd anniversary of Dalagang Bukid, the first Filipino-produced film, which was directed by Jose Nepomuceno.

It fired a projectile of eight livres in weight, equivalent to 8.633 English pounds, or 8 lb 10 oz (the French livre was 7.916% heavier than the English pound weight). They were used as main guns on light ships of the early 19th century, and on the quarterdeck and forecastle of ships of the line. They were similar in design to the Canon de 8 Gribeauval.  Usage  The 8-pounder was the heaviest of the light guns. Its light weight allowed it to be mounted on the upper gun posts of ships of the line, where the timber of the deck was too light to support larger guns; furthermore, it could be mounted relatively high without jeopardy to the stability of the ship, and could be installed at will at different positions. This made it useful as a chase gun, since its load packed enough power to damage the rigging of a fleeing enemy (if used as a bow chaser) or of a pursuing enemy (when used as a stern chaser).

In 2012, Mozilla launched Open Badges 1.0 and partnered with the City of Chicago to launch The Chicago Summer of Learning (CSOL), a badges initiative to keep local youth ages four to 24 active and engaged during the summer. Institutions and organizations like Purdue University, MOUSE and the U.K.-based DigitalME adopted badges, and Mozilla saw international interest in badging programs from Australia and Italy to China and Scotland. By 2013, over 1,450 organizations were issuing Open Badges and Mozilla's partnership with Chicago had grown into the Cities of Learning Initiative, an opportunity to apply CSOL's success across the country. In 2014, Mozilla launched the Badge Alliance, a network of organizations and individuals committed to building the open badging ecosystem Founding members include Mozilla, the MacArthur Foundation, DigitalME, Sprout Fund, and Blackboard. More than 650 organizations from six continents signed up through the Badge Alliance to contribute to the Open Badges ecosystem. In 2015, the Badge Alliance spun out of Mozilla and became a part of MacArthur Foundation spin off, Collective Shift - a nonprofit devoted to redesigning social systems for a connected world. Later that year, Collective Shift partnered with Concentric Sky to develop Open Badges 2.0. That same year, Concentric Sky launched the open source project Badgr to serve as a reference implementation for Open Badges. The Badgr Server is written in Python using the Django framework; source code is available under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. In early 2016, IMS Global announced their commitment to Open Badges as an inter-operable standard for digital credentials, and in late 2016, Mozilla announced that stewardship of the Open Badges standard would transition officially to IMS Global. In late 2018, Mozilla announced that it would retire the Mozilla Backpack and migrate all users to Badgr. Technical details Open Badges are designed to serve a broad range of digital badge use cases, including both academic and non-academic uses. The core Open Badge specification is made up of three types of Badge Objects: ; Assertion : Represents an awarded badge. It contains information about a single badge that belongs to an individual earner. ; BadgeClass : Contains information about the accomplishment(s) a specific badge recognizes. As the same badge may be awarded to many earners, there may be many Assertions that correspond to a single BadgeClass. ; IssuerOrganization : Contains a collection of information about the entity (e.g., person, organization) which issued a badge. Beginning with version 1.1, valid JSON-LD must be used for Open Badges. Version 1.1 also adds Extensions, a structure that follows a standard format for collaboratively extending Badge Objects so that any issuer, earner, or consumer can understand the information added to badges. Any issuer may define and publish Extensions to include new types of metadata in badges. Any other issuer may use the same extensions to publish similar information in a mutually recognizable way. An exploratory prototype draft xAPI vocabulary has been defined so that Open Badges may be referenceable from Experience API activity streams.

During the cold war this team successfully performed in many competitions. The Golden Crown was officially founded in 1958. Fourteen Iranian pilots were sent to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, Germany, in order to learn aerobatics in jet aircraft. Nine of them returned to Iran after a couple of months and the remaining five went on to undergo further flying training. After 72 training sessions, the team performed its first aerobatic display in 1958. It was equipped with four Republic F-84G Thunderjet aircraft. By 1959, it had nine F-84s. The team performed near Mehrabad International Airport and later, at Kooshk Nosrat 100 kilometres from Tehran. During the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the team was disbanded after the dissolution of the Imperial Iranian Air Force.

He studied piano at the Royal College of Music in London later becoming professor there. He composed songs, chamber music and orchestral pieces. He was one of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music. Early life Herbert Sharpe was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England in 1861 the son of a Yorkshire merchant. He gained a piano scholarship (The Halifax Scholarship) at the National Training School for Music (now the Royal College of Music) in 1876. He went on to succeed Eugen d'Albert as the Queen's Scholar there studying under Arthur Sullivan, Ebenezer Prout, J. F. Barnett and Frederick Bridge. After finishing his studies in 1882, he gave many concerts in the provinces as well as in London where he organised several series of trio concerts between 1899 and 1902. He married Bertha Turrell in April 1884 and his son the cellist Cedric Sharpe was born in 1891. Career Sharpe was one of the founding members of the Royal College of Music being appointed professor of piano there in 1884 one year after it opened. In 1890 he became an examiner for the Associated Board. He was one of the first to bring the music of the modern French school into the curriculum. The composer Vaughan Williams was one of his most well-known pupils. His successful career was to end in 1925 when he died suddenly while still in post aged 64. The pianist S. G. Shimmin who was one of his pupils wrote the following as part of the obituary article published in the RCM magazine in 1925: > Mr. Sharpe brought to his teaching certain qualities that endeared him to > all his pupils. His patience was phenomenal. Imperturbably genial and kind, > he would go over a difficult point again and again if necessary, without a > trace of irritation. He had a quiet comprehensiveness of personality that > made pupils trust his guidance entirely. His teaching was not of the narrow > kind that sees but a segment of musical truth and proclaims it as the whole, > thereby warping instead of widening the powers of judgment in the pupil. His > musical vision was wide, and embraced many different manifestations of the > art. He did not rely on any particular \\"method\\" in teaching, but used > largely the way of example at the keyboard. It was a rare pleasure to bear > him play passages from Debussy and Ravel, with a quality of tone almost > uncanny in its beauty. But memory of all [sic], perhaps, was his Mozart > playing which had unassuming serenity that approached perfection. > His influence for good in the life and work of the College has been a very > potent one, and perhaps all the more so owing to the complete freedom from > anything spectacular in his artistic nature. Always modest and self- > effacing, inclining to no extremity of view, but always keeping a splendid > balance and poise in his musical outlook, he has been instrumental in giving > to the innumerable students who passed through his hands a broad and sane > view of their work which is a very precious thing in these days of change > and instability. While deeply mourning his loss, they will resolve to carry > on in the light of his example. Compositions Sharpe's principal compositions are as follows: Piano solos: Op. 1‚Äì10 ‚Äì various, Songs of The Year twelve two-part songs Op. 16, Twelve two-part songs Songs of Moor and Mountain Op. 18, Twelve two-part songs Songs by the Sea Op. 19, Five pieces Op. 23, Five Character Pieces for piano duet Op. 24, Twelve trios Op. 25, Legende for Violin Op.26, Two Musical Sketches Op. 28, Four duets for 2 violins and piano Op. 29, Idylle for flute and piano Op. 38, Variations for two pianos Op. 46, Three four-part songs with orchestra (also for female voices with piano) Op. 52, Three Part Songs Op.54, Suite for Piano Op. 58, Three symphonic pieces for piano duet Op. 59, Pianoforte School Op. 60, Pantomime Suite Op. 61, Suite for flute and piano Op. 62, Six Two-part Songs Op.63, Suite for violin and piano Op. 65, Six English Fantasias Op. 71, Fantasie-Romance for Piano \\"We Two\\" Op.73, Preludes for Piano Op.74.

The first revolves mainly around the Albanian members of the International Brigades, the horrors of war that they experience and also their personalities and personal philosophies.

The second story is the love between Gori, a handsome Albanian soldier in his twenties with curly hair, and Anita, a beautiful Spanish nurse who tends to the wounded soldiers. They meet and fall in love in a hellish improvised hospital, which the author describes as always being in turmoil and very noisy, after Gori is wounded in battle and Anita tends to his wounds.

Saylor, founder, chairman, and CEO of MicroStrategy, Inc. The Mobile Wave provides an analysis of then- current trends in mobile technology from the point of view of a scholar of the history of science. The book argues that mobile devices will become essential tools for life in the modern day, changing how businesses operate and how industries and economies are powered. In The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything, Saylor argues that mobile technology will change how people live worldwide, affecting businesses, entire industries, and the very economies they power. Saylor has also been featured in Forbes and CNN for the ideas presented in his book. Synopsis Chapter 1 - The Wave: The Shape of the Wave lays the foundation for some of the themes that occur throughout the book. These include the universal nature of mobile devices, and how mobile and cloud computing technologies will continue to disrupt established industries and the old ways of doing business. This chapter also introduces the ongoing Information Revolution as the third great revolution to transform society, after the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. Chapter 2 - Computers: The Evolution to Mobile Computing discusses the four great waves of computing described by technologists as leading to the fifth mobile wave: the mainframe, the minicomputer, the personal computer and the Internet PC. Saylor writes that a critical turning point unleashing the mobile wave was triggered by Apple, with the introduction of the affordable iPhone and its App Store, multi-touch capabilities and built-in GPS. Chapter 3 - Paper: The Demise of Paper covers a short history of media delivery systems, ranging from the first clay tablets around 3000 B.C., up to the highly disruptive electronic content transforming the print industry. The chapter also discusses the benefits of electronic publishing, from distribution efficiencies that save money and protect the environment, to display format flexibility making the content more appealing. Chapter 4 ‚Äì Entertainment: The New Universal Screen describes how mobile technology has evolved to display movies, TV programming and video games. The impact of content mobility on advertisers is also discussed. Chapter 5 ‚Äì Wallet: A Smarter Wallet and Intelligent Money covers a short history of money and payment systems, and describes the effect the mobile wave is having on banking systems, including offering greater security. Chapter 6 ‚Äì Social Networks: A Mobile Social World discusses how evolving mobile/social applications are changing society, including their impact on events ranging from 2010‚Äôs unrest in the Middle East, to the social activities of today‚Äôs teenagers. Chapter 7 ‚Äì Medicine: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare describes the impact of mobile technology on the medical industry. Topics include the wide benefits of Telemedicine, improvements to medical record keeping, and technical advances to assist sight and hearing impaired people. Chapter 8 ‚Äì Education: Remaking Education for Everyone covers the positive disruption mobile technology brings to the education system. Expanded access to affordable education along with improved learning and retention using mobile content are shown as two ways the mobile wave is improving education. Chapter 9 ‚Äì Developing World: Bootstrapping the Developing World highlights the benefits of mobile technology on Third World countries. By facilitating an improved communications infrastructure, launching more secure, less corrupt financial transaction systems and enabling businesses to more easily sell their products where there‚Äôs higher demand, the developing world is already enjoying the benefits of the Mobile Wave. Chapter 10 ‚Äì New World: Human Energy Unleashed ties the book‚Äôs themes together again, including reiterating the transformative effects on business and society of mobile technology. The privacy issue is touched upon, along with a suggestion that perhaps an electronic bill of rights type document could be useful to help navigate these issues. Reception The Mobile Wave has been featured on several book bestseller lists: *Ranked #5 on The Wall Street Journal Bestseller list on July 15, 2012 in the Hardcover Business category. *Debuted on The New York Times Bestseller list at position #31 in Hardcover Nonfiction the week of July 23, 2012, and ranked in position #5 in Hardcover Business in August 2012. *Ranked #1 in The Washington Post DC-area Bestsellers list in August 2012.

It stars Jomari Yllana, Ara Mina and Christian Vasquez. The film was critically acclaimed and garnered numerous awards in the Philippines. With a soundtrack by Arnel de Pano and Lucien Letaba, the song Minsan itself was performed by Jonathan Badon. The film was produced by lawyer Joji Alonso under the MLR Films studio. Synopsis Jerry is a wide-awake tourist guide in Cebu who knows all the angles, and who has supported his divorced mother and younger brother and sister since their musician father deserted the family for a younger woman. Jerry guides tour buses, taking the mostly Japanese tourists boating, golfing and to strip shows. Jerry also acts as a pimp, and even prostitutes himself. As the breadwinner he makes sacrifices for his family but wields control over his siblings and mother in return. Luna is a young woman who joins one of the tours. She always carries a camera. Her boyfriend, Alex, follows her. While they are on a boat trip Luna lets her camera fall into the sea. Alex proposes to Luna but has an accident that causes him to start losing his vision, and he withdraws the proposal. Luna returns with Jerry to try to recover the camera, which has taken on symbolic value as a store of memories of past happiness. Jerry becomes increasingly attracted to Luna, but his feelings are not reciprocated as he is unable to give except in exchange for some reward. Eventually Luna is able to make both Jerry and Alex recover from their handicaps and become emotionally mature. The camera is recovered from the sea, and the images captured on it end the film.

Jacob as Matthew *Natasha Denser as Noemi Production The movie was shot by MLR Films in the tourist area of Cebu, including the Argao Church, Kawasan Falls and Moalboal diving sites. It originally was going under the title of Usahay. The two leads, Jomari Yllana and Ara Mina, were a couple in real life, but split up soon after the movie was completed. The resulting gossip helped publicize the movie. The film was Yllana's comeback after an absence of four years from the big screen since Gatas: Sa Dibdib ng Kaaway (2004). which she did in 2000. The film includes underwater scenes shot by Tamara Benitez, who also had a small role as an American backpacker. The budget was reportedly high given that the photography involved complicated underwater and aerial shots, such as the sweeping opening footage taken from a helicopter. Yllana has said that the film was exceptionally difficult to make, and he not only had to learn how to speak Visayan, Japanese, Korean and Spanish in his portrayal of the tour guide, but being naturally adverse to the water, he also had to take a crash course in diving to be able to accomplish some of his dives up to in the film, amongst dolphins, swordfish and whale sharks. With a soundtrack by Arnel de Pano and Lucien Letaba, the song Minsan itself was performed by Jonathan Badon. Reception The film opened commercially in Metro Manila theaters on November 24, and had its premiere night on November 22 at SM Megamalls Cinema 1 and 2. The film was a major critical success in the Philippines, garnering 8 awards and 4 nominations in 2005. The film was originally submitted to be showcased at the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) in December 2004. Minsan Pa won Best Director, Best Motion Picture (Drama), Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Song, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Drama, Musical or Comedy) (Ara Mina) and was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Drama) (Jomari Yllana) at the Golden Screen Awards. It also received awards for Best Film, Best Performance by Male or Female, Adult or Child, Individual or Ensemble in Leading or Supporting Role (Jomari Yllana) and Best Screenplay at the Young Critics Circle Awards. At the Gawad Urian Awards, the film received nominations for Best Actor (Jomari Yllana), Best Music (Lucien Letaba and Arnel de Pano) and Best Supporting Actress (Ara Mina). The Filipino Reporter cited the film as one of the best Filipino movies of 2004. The Manila Bulletin described the film as a \\"must-see movie\\", \\"a love story with an unusual twist in that the two main characters do not end up with each other\\", and said \\"with its tight direction and beautiful cinematography that makes much of Cebus beautiful tourist spots (such as its famous dive sites in Moalboal), the movie is expected to break attendance records once more like Jeturian did with Bridal Shower that was both a critical and box- office success. Liz Braun of the Toronto Sun said of this movie, \\"Minsan Pa has all the requisite tears and drama and reconciliation to qualify as melodrama, but there is a lot more going on in the film about relationships in general and the passage of time... Minsan Pa is beautiful to look at, and not just for the cinematography.\\" The Filipino Express said \\"Ara Mina's role in this Jeffrey Jeturian film actually lies in the borderline of lead and supporting actress. Although she is the leading lady of Jomari Yllana and is, in fact, billed alongside his name, her character is basically secondary to the flow of the story (her first scene, in fact, comes much later in the movie). But whether lead or support, Ara Mina had already proven her worth as an actress in films like Mano Po 2 and Huling Birhen sa Lupa‚Äîthe two films that had already given her acting trophies in the past. In Minsan Pa, she delivers another fine performance that is worth of more acting awards.

Nuocytes are amongst the first cells activated in type 2 immune responses and are thought to play important roles in activating and recruiting other cells types through their production of type 2 cytokines interleukin 4, 5 and 13. Nuocytes have been observed to proliferate in the presence of IL-7 in vitro. Nuocytes contribute to the expulsion of helminth worms and to the pathology of colitis and allergic airways disease. The nuocyte was identified at the same time as several other immune cells that play similar roles in type 2 immunity. These include Natural Helper Cells (NHCs), Innate Helper 2 (Ih2) cells and Multi- Potent Progenitor (MPP) type 2 cells. The exact relationship between these cell types remains contentious but all share a type-2-inducing phenotype. MPP type 2 cells appear to differ from the other populations in that they have a myeloid, rather than lymphoid, origin. Nuocytes have been shown to have a lymphoid origin and a developmental pathway that is dependent upon the transcription factor RORŒ± and Notch signalling. Pro-T cell progenitors retain nuocyte developmental potential but, unlike T cells, the thymus is dispensable for their development.

She is the recipient of a 2007 National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship in poetry. Life Jane Satterfield was born in Northamptonshire, England and raised in the United States. She is the daughter of an American serviceman and an Irish-English mother. Her mother had grown up in Corby, where she also gave birth to Satterfield. Satterfield earned a Bachelor of Arts in English and Creative Writing from Loyola College (now Loyola University Maryland) in 1986. The following year, she received a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Iowa. In 1994 Satterfield moved to England for a year as a result of her first husband's participation in the Fulbright Program. At this time she became pregnant with her daughter Catherine who was also born in England. Satterfield and Catherine's father eventually divorced. Until 2006, Satterfield raised her daughter largely as a single mother. Satterfield writes about this period in her life in Daughters of Empire: A Memoir of a Year in Britain and Beyond. Satterfield became a tenured professor of writing at Loyola College in 2005. She currently lives in Baltimore, Maryland. Her husband is poet Ned Balbo.Lori A.

In 2007, Satterfield was awarded both a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Literature for poetry and the Pirate's Alley Faulkner Society Gold Medal for the Essay. In reviewing Satterfield's memoir Daughters of Empire, critic Rick Taylor of Elevate Difference writes that \\"the evocative power of her memory and the clarity of her language, she draws the reader willingly into this vortex\\". Critic Sondra Guttman notes that \\"Satterfield's approach is more scholarly than most... [and] brings a poet's eye and ear to the task of grappling with questions of gender, sexuality, and maternity\\". According to Susan McCallum-Smith in Belles Lettres, Satterfield describes \\"the terrifying vortex of new motherhood...where one's body is a foreign country, where sensual and creative energies are smothered, constricted, then transformed.\\"http://redroom.com/member/jane-satterfield/reviews/daughters-of- empire-by-jane-satterfield Reviewer Deborah L. Humphreys praised Satterfield's Assignation at Vanishing Point for being \\"so carefully arranged, there occasionally appears to be a sort of enjambment between several poems. A link between senses...\\" Nonetheless, Humphrey did comment that \\"the use of the historical figures in several of the poems was an obstacle in my reading. Did I need to know about the references, the lives or writings of saints, philosophers and others? Does the work stand on its own?... Was I missing an essential element or a level of richness?\\" By contrast, reviewer Allyson Shaw observed that Satterfield deftly incorporates \\"fragments from the lives of women writers from Simone de Beauvoir to Bront√´. These bits of lost history are re-imagined in epistolary persona poems and lyric meditations, yet these voices are not just claimed; they are interrogated.\\"http://www.webdelsol.com/Perihelion/satterfield.htm In reviewing Her Familiars Caitlin Doyle noted that \\"Satterfield's intense engagement with political and military matters marks a central difference between Her Familiars and her previous collections,\\" adding, \\"She shines as a poet when drawing unique parallels across the centuries, placing surprising details in relation to each other so that her poems achieve a densely layered complexity.\\"http://www.thecommononline.org/reviews/her-familiars Bibliography Satterfield has published four books of poetry, a memoir, and numerous essays.

Biography  His father Saturnino Jos√© √Ålvarez, was a successful merchant, and also Treasurer of Commerce of the city of Buenos Aires. Juli√°n √Ålvarez studied at the Real Colegio de San Carlos later attending the University of Charcas where he obtained a Law degree. He took part in the May Revolution and was one of the signatories of the populous petition to the Viceroy of May 25, 1810. After the defeat, exile and death of Mariano Moreno, he headed the \\"Sociedad Patri√≥tica\\", the most liberal political group in Buenos Aires. He was arrested during the revolution of April 1811, but soon regained his freedom. √Ålvarez supported the creation of the First Triumvirate and worked in its secretariat under Bernardino Rivadavia. As a ranking member of the Masonic Lodge Independencia de Buenos Aires in 1812, he received General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n at his arrival from Europe with the members of the Lautaro Lodge, which he joined. He was a representative to the short-lived Assembly of 1812. He supported the Second Triumvirate, and was arrested for a short time after turning around and requesting its dissolution. The Supreme Director Gervasio Antonio de Posadas named him as Deputy Secretary of State, supporting the work of Nicol√°s de Herrera. After the fall of Supreme Director Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, he left politics for a period of time. In 1816 he took part in the revival of the Lautaro Lodge, now called \\"Ministerial Lodge\\", directed by Secretary Juan Gregorio Garc√≠a de Tagle, and supported Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n politically. Between 1815 and 1820 he also directed the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper. In 1819 he was sent as representative of Pueyrred√≥n to Estanislao L√≥pez, who was becoming a dangerous political enemy. The year 1820 was politically a very troublesome period in the young country of Argentina. At the beginning of the year during what is called the Anarchy of the Year XX, governor Manuel de Sarratea put him in jail at the request of L√≥pez. He escaped, in the midst of the political chaos of the city and a few months later he went to Montevideo (Uruguay). √Ålvarez supported the Empire of Brazil over the Cisplatine Province (today's Uruguay) and worked at several government posts during the government of Carlos Federico Lecor. When the province seceded from Argentina and Brazil to become Uruguay, he was a member of the Constitutional Congress of the new country for San Jos√© de Mayo (1830). Since 1829 he was editor of the \\"El Constitucional\\" newspaper in Canelones. On 24 November 1811 he married Mar√≠a Pascuala Obes in Buenos Aires, sister of Lucas Obes. In the first decade of the independence of Uruguay, he was part of the group known as \\"The Five Brothers\\", which had great influence during the presidency of Fructuoso Rivera. From 1831 √Ålvarez was President of the Supreme Court of Uruguay. During the Uruguayan Civil War, he was a member of the Gobierno de la Defensa, and was three times President of the Chamber of Deputies of Uruguay from 1841 to 1843. His children married into prominent families of Argentina and Uruguay. His daughters, first Felicia and after her death, her sister Estanislada, married General Juan Andr√©s Gelly y Obes.

Owners of the hacked accounts were no longer able to access their accounts, and the website repeatedly encouraged its users to change their passwords after the incident. Vicente Silveira, the director of LinkedIn, confirmed, on behalf of the company, that the website was hacked in its official blog. He also said that the holders of the compromised accounts would find their passwords were no longer valid on the website. LinkedIn said, in an official statement, that they would email all its members with security instructions and instructions on how they could reset their passwords. In May 2016, LinkedIn discovered an additional 100 million email addresses and hashed passwords that claimed to be additional data from the same 2012 breach. In response, LinkedIn invalidated the passwords of all users that had not changed their passwords since 2012. Reaction by communities and users Rep. Mary Bono Mack of the United States Congress commented on the incident, \\"How many times is this going to happen before Congress finally wakes up and takes action? This latest incident once again brings into sharp focus the need to pass data protection legislation.\\" Senator Patrick Leahy said, \\"Reports of another major data breach should give pause to American consumers who, now more than ever, share sensitive personal information in their online transactions and networking ... Congress should make comprehensive data privacy and cybercrime legislation a top priority.\\" Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, \\"Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information.\\" Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted in a way that was fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O‚ÄôHarra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore‚ÄìWright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach. The lawsuit sought injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class. Response from LinkedIn LinkedIn apologized immediately after the data breach, and asked its users to immediately change their passwords. The Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted the LinkedIn Corporation in investigating the theft. As of 8 June 2012, the investigation was still in its early stages, and the company said it was unable to determine whether the hackers were also able to steal the email addresses associated with the compromised user accounts as well. LinkedIn said that the users whose passwords are compromised would be unable to access their LinkedIn accounts using their old passwords. Controversy Internet security experts said that the passwords were easy to unscramble because of LinkedIn's failure to use a salt when hashing them, which is considered an insecure practice because it allows attackers to quickly reverse the scrambling process using existing standard rainbow tables, pre-made lists of matching scrambled and unscrambled passwords. Another issue that sparked controversy was the iOS app provided by LinkedIn, which grabs personal names, emails, and notes from a mobile calendar without the user's approval. Security experts working for Skycure Security said that the application collects a user's personal data and sends it to the LinkedIn server. LinkedIn claimed the permission for this feature is user- granted, and the information is sent securely using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. The company added that it had never stored or shared that information with a third party. Arrest of suspect On October 5, 2016, Russian hacker Yevgeniy Nikulin was detained by Czech police in Prague. The United States had requested an Interpol warrant for him. A United States grand jury indicted Nikulin and three unnamed co-conspirators on charges of aggravated identity theft and computer intrusion. Prosecutors alleged that Nikulin stole a LinkedIn employee's username and password, using them to gain access to the corporation's network. Nikulin was also accused of hacking into Dropbox and Formspring, allegedly conspiring to sell stolen Formspring customer data, including usernames, e-mail addresses, and passwords. Nikulin is facing a Czech hearing to determine whether he will be extradited to the United States. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova indicated that Russian authorities were trying to block the extradition. Nikulin is currently being held in the Santa Rita Jail. Nikulin is scheduled to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine whether he is mentally competent.

Her best known roles were probably as the runaway heiress Geraldine Melford in the original London production of Slade and Reynolds' musical Free as Air and, on television, as Drusilla Lamb, secretary to Mr. Rose in the detective series of that name. Early stage career Gillian Lewis was born in Tisbury, Wiltshire.Biographical note in Theatre Royal, Brighton programme for Difference of Opinion (January 1965) She trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and then worked with the company, combining minor acting parts with the job of assistant stage manager. In 1953 she had a supporting role (Cousin Rosie) in Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds' Christmas musical The Merry Gentleman at the Theatre Royal, Bristol and the following year worked backstage at the Vaudeville Theatre in London when Slade and Reynolds' Salad DaysTheatre Royal programme for Difference of Opinion, loc.cit. transferred there from Bristol.Oxford Companion to Popular Music (1991) While working with the Ipswich Repertory Company, she met her future husband, the actor Peter Beton (born 1930). Free as Air (1957) In 1957, after Slade and Reynolds had enjoyed considerable acclaim with Salad Days, Lewis and Patricia Bredin (who in the same year was the United Kingdom's first ever entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest) took the main female roles in their follow-up show, Free as Air, which opened at the Savoy Theatre in London on 6 June 1957 following an initial season in Manchester. Although this and other Slade musicals never quite matched the success of Salad Days,See, for example, Oxford Companion to Popular Music (1991) Free as Air, which was set on the fictional Channel Island of Terhou,Based on Jethou ran for 417 performances, some critics regarding it as more slick and professional than its predecessor.Independent obituary of Julian Slade, loc.cit.. Rexton S. Bunnett, an avid collector of memorabilia of musical theatre, described Free as Air as \\"a true book musical\\" rather than (like Salad Days) \\"a flimsy, revue like show\\": sleeve notes to 2007 CD release of Free as Air (Sepia 1102).

Like Lewis, both Harper and Tewson moved successfully into television in the 1960s.Gerald Harper achieved fame as Adam Adamant and James Hadleigh. Josephine Tewson's best known role came in the 1990s as Hyacinth Bucket's neighbour Elizabeth in the situation comedy Keeping Up Appearances. Leonard Rossiter, remembered for his TV roles as Rupert Rigsby and Reginald Perrin, was also in the original production of Free as Air. In 1967 Lewis and Pauline Yates, who later played Rossiter's wife, Elizabeth Perrin, appeared together in an episode of Mr. Rose (\\"The Honest Villain\\"). Peter Beton also appeared in Free as Air. Other roles In the early 1960s Lewis played extensively in repertory theatre in Bristol, appearing in, among many other productions, revivals of John Dighton's The Happiest Days of Your Life (1960) (based on his screenplay for the 1949 film starring Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford), No√´l Coward's Private Lives (1960) and Blithe Spirit (1961) and Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (1960). In 1962 she played the flirtatious Natalia Snevellicci in the Bristol premi√®re of Step into the Limelight, a musical by Edgar K. Bruce and Betty Lawrence based on the Crummles theatrical troupe in Charles Dickens' novel Nicholas Nickleby. In 2004 a compact disc was released of \\"demo\\" recordings made at the time by members of the cast, with Lawrence on piano, together with ones cut in 1969 when the show was revived in Bristol with a new cast that included Josephine Gordon and Elric Cooper. Lewis appeared also at other provincial theatres: for example, with Robert Beatty, Kynaston Reeves and Geoffrey Palmer in George Ross and Campbell Singer's Difference of Opinion at the Theatre Royal, Brighton in 1965.Theatre Royal programme, loc.cit., for production beginning on 25 January 1965.

Lewis took the feisty role of Claire (the part played by Ann Miller in the 1949 film and on Broadway by the show's librettist Betty Comden) alongside two American actresses, Andrea Jaffe and Carol Arthur.Ethan Mordden, notes for 1993 Deutsche Grammophon CD 437 516-2 One view of Lewis's stage persona in the late '50s and early '60s is that she, Susan Hampshire and Anna Dawson, who all had leading roles in Slade musicals, \\"possessed an extraordinary Englishness of feature and bearing and voice that seems absolutely to have vanished from the theatre, perhaps from the world itself\\".\\"Icarus\\" at . Susan Hampshire starred in Follow That Girl and Anna Dawson in Wildest Dreams (both 1960). Both subsequently achieved fame on television, Hampshire notably as Fleur in the BBC's adaptation of John Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga (1967). Television in the mid-1960s In the mid '60s Gillian Lewis appeared in episodes of such popular television series as Gideon's Way (1964), The Avengers (1965), Mogul (1965), Public Eye (1965) and The Baron (1966). A number of her roles, then and later, were in series that subsequently acquired \\"cult\\" status among devotees. In the Avengers episode, \\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\\" (broadcast December 1965), she played Laura Burford, an old friend of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) who was mysteriously lured away from scientific work alongside her tactile fianc√© to a horticultural project aimed at propagating menacing bean-like plants with gigantic tendrils. As Joyce Grant in The Baron (\\"So Dark the Night\\", broadcast 15 March 1967), her father died in a spooky country house just before the series' eponymous hero (Steve Forrest as John Mannering) and his glamorous assistant (Sue Lloyd as Cordelia Winfield) arrived to value some antiques. This was the prelude to \\"an eerie web of intrigue, murder and revenge, with two girls facing hair- raising danger\\".Notes to Network DVD, The Baron (2005), page 13 Such parts were fairly typical of those available to young women making guest appearances in adventure series of the time. Mr. Rose (1967) In the influentialPhilip Purser in Leslie Halliwell's Television Companion (8th ed., 1984) Mr. Rose (Granada, 1967), starring William Mervyn as Charles Rose, an acerbic retired Scotland Yard detective,See, for example, Hallilwell, supra; notes to Mr. Rose: complete first series (Network DVD, 2012). Mervyn, who was probably best known for his role as the Bishop of St. Ogg's in All Gas and Gaiters, first appeared as Chief Inspector Rose in The Odd Man (1962). Lewis played his live- in secretary, Miss Drusilla Lamb. Drusilla was employed ostensibly to help Rose with his memoirs, although work on these was repeatedly delayed by his getting involved in unofficial investigative work.In his use of \\"influential\\" to describe Mr. Rose, Purser (Halliwell, supra) went so far as to draw a comparison with the American series Ironside, which began in 1967 with Raymond Burr as a former San Francisco police chief assisted by three young officers, including Barbara Anderson as the fashionable and well-heeled Eve Whitfield. A year earlier, in the BBC's Adam Adamant Lives!, Gerald Harper as Adamant had, like Rose, a young female assistant (Juliet Harmer as Georgina Jones) and a manservant (Jack May). Though set thirty or so years earlier, the most similar role on British television to that of Drusilla Lamb was probably that of Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) in the adaptations of Agatha Christie's Poirot novels starring David Suchet (LWT/ITV, 1989‚Äì). Lewis as Drusilla Lamb Over a series of 13 episodes produced and mostly written by Philip Mackie, Lewis portrayed Drusilla as a highly professional and, at first, rather prim, proper and somewhat icyIn the first episode, \\"The Bright Bomber\\", Donald Webster as John Halifax refers to Drusilla (to her face) as \\"frigid\\" (a word with overtones of sexual unresponsiveness), but quickly apologises and changes his description to \\"icy\\". assistant who had been through finishing school, had a shorthand speed of 150 words per minute,Episode, \\"The Noble Roman\\", broadcast 3 March 1967 but was unable (so she always said) to make decent coffee.Although Drusilla was required to cook infrequently, it transpired that she had achieved only \\"highly commended\\" for her domestic science at finishing school: episode, \\"The Honest Villain\\", 14 April 1967. However, despite her apparent hauteur, she was also beautiful,Sleeve notes, 2012 DVD (loc.cit.) attracting ready attention from men to whom Rose introduced her, and, in the first episode (broadcast 17 February 1967), her potential sexiness was hinted at by an unexpected scene in which Rose's manservant (Donald Webster as John Halifax) burst into her bedroom as she was about to put on a jumper over her bra and panties.\\"The Bright Bomber\\", loc.cit. Halifax's intentions were perfectly honourable: Rose had just told him about Drusilla's proximity to a bomb explosion and he was concerned for her welfare. Despite Drusilla's momentary loss of composure, she appeared largely unfazed by this intrusion, as also by other early incidents, such as a bomb explosion at Rose's front door and (a few years before \\"women's lib\\" began to take hold) Rose's pinching her buttocks, apparently to demonstrate that he alone was capable of shocking her. Her generally worldly and practical outlook was further corroborated by her calm demeanour at a boisterous riverboat party that culminated in a provocative striptease by a blonde teenager (Judy Geeson) who had been hired to compromise Rose.Episode, \\"The Tin God\\", broadcast 31 March 1967. In the event, Rose outwitted his protagonists. Even so, Rose thought Drusilla bossyEpisode, \\"The One Woman\\", broadcast 5 May 1967 and \\"refused to be nagged\\" by her on Sunday afternoon.Episode, \\"The Good Loser\\", broadcast 12 May 1967 She could also be quite spirited, even blunt and wilful: she was angrily defiant when held prisoner after being kidnapped,Episode, \\"The Avenging Angel\\", 28 April 1967 while, during a minor domestic encounter, Rose seemed amused by her telling him to \\"damn well do\\" something himself because she thought she was being treated unreasonably.Episode, \\"The Honest Villain\\", broadcast 14 April 1967 An enticing contrast with Drusilla's initial twinset imageA later description of Lewis herself was of a \\"Home Counties heroine [who] seemed most at home in twin set and pearls\\", although, as noted, she came from Wiltshire, rather than the south-east, and cut her theatrical teeth in Bristol. In addition, her roles on television were diverse. In \\"The Tin God\\", Rose gave Drusilla a set of pearls for her birthday, while Halifax bought her a fashionable shift dress that she herself said she would not have dared to buy on her own. was provided by a working cruise to South Africa on which she enjoyed a romance with a suave ex-jewel thief and Halifax teased her that she was displaying too much of her cleavage while relaxing on deck.Episode, \\"The Jolly Swagman\\", broadcast 17 March 1967 It eventually came to light that in fact her background was not as straight forward as it had seemed: specifically, she had been encouraged to apply for the job with Rose by an ex-army confidence trickster whom she believed to be her father. His unwelcome re-appearance in Drusilla's life following release from a seven-year prison sentence led both Rose, who he tried to blackmail, and Halifax, who began to emit some tender feelings for his female colleague, to take stock of their relationship with her, but then actively to stand by her.Episode, \\"The Bad Halfpenny\\", broadcast 7 April 1967, in which Drusilla also confirmed that her mother, whose surname she used, had died when she was 17. In the final episode of the series, Drusilla told Rose that she had \\"no private life\\", although it became reasonably clear that she reciprocated Halifax's apparent fondness for her.\\"The Good Loser\\", loc.cit. The first series of Mr. Rose was released on DVD by Network in 2012. Lewis did not return for the second series (1968) in which Jennifer Clulow played Drusilla's successor, Jessica Dalton. In the first episode of that series,\\"The Frozen Swede, broadcast 30 May 1968 Rose recalled to Halifax that he had given Drusilla away at her wedding. Later TV roles Lewis appeared in a number of later series, including Department S, starring Peter Wyngarde as Jason King (1969), the ground- breaking science fiction drama Doomwatch (1970), The Mind of Mr. J.G. Reeder (as Margaret Belman, a role she took over from Virginia Stride, in several episodes based on stories by Edgar Wallace, 1971), Crown Court (1972), The Duchess of Duke Street (1976) and The Mallens, adapted from the novels of Catherine Cookson (nine episodes as Jane Radlet, 1979‚Äì80). Films Among Lewis's film credits were Ring of Spies (1964), based on the events surrounding the Portland spy ring of the early 1960s, Galton and Simpson's satirical spoof The Spy with a Cold Nose (1966) with a cast that included Laurence Harvey, Lionel Jeffries and Eric Sykes, and a TV movie Belgrove Hotel, Goodbye (1970). She also made an uncredited appearance as a television announcer in Fahrenheit 451 (1966). Film historian Leslie Halliwell dismissed The Spy with a Cold Nose as a \\"rather painful, overacted and overwritten farce full of obvious jokes masquerading as satire\\".Halliwell's Film Guide, 7th ed (1989) The essence of Lewis's role as Lady Warburton was captured in the opening sentence of Galton and Simpson's 1967 novel based on their screenplay: \\"To the eyes of her beholders, the beauty of Sandra, Lady Warburton, lay in strict ratio to the importance they attached to her bank balance\\".Ray Galton & Alan Simpson, The Spy with a Cold Nose (Arrow Books, 1967) External links Unsung heroines ‚Äì Gillian Lewis (an appreciation of her early career in musicals) * Still of Gillian Lewis in The Avengers (1965) * Still of Gillian Lewis and Laurence Harvey in The Spy with a Cold Nose (1966) * Still of Gillian Lewis in The Baron (1967) * Still of Gillian Lewis as Drusilla Lamb with William Mervyn (Charles Rose) and Donald Webster (John Halifax) in Mr. Rose (1967) * YouTube extract from episode of Mr. Rose, \\"The Nobel Roman\\" (1967) with Gillian Lewis as Drusilla Lamb, William Mervyn & Donald Webster * Videocaps of Gillian Lewis References English film actresses English television actresses English female singers English musical theatre actresses People from Tisbury, Wiltshire ","title":"Gillian Lewis"},{"id":"36070428","text":"Euriphene coerulea, the western nymph, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

The Registry was co-founded in 2012 with the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law to provide detailed information about known exonerations in the United States since 1989. As of February 6, 2020, the Registry has 2,551 known exonerations in the United States since 1989.The National Registry of Exonerations The National Registry does not include more than 1,800 defendants cleared in 15 large-scale police scandals that came to light between 1989 and March 7, 2017, in which officers systematically framed innocent defendants.See also Michael McLaughlin, National Registry of Exonerations: More Than 2,000 People Freed After Wrongful Convictions (May 22, 2012) and Huffington Post; Michael Doyle, New national registry lists exonerations from wrongful convictions (May 21, 2012). McClatchy Newspapers. The co-founders of the Registry are Rob Warden, then the executive director of Northwestern's Center on Wrongful Convictions, and Michigan Law professor Samuel R.

According to Gross, \\"these cases merely point to a much larger number of tragedies that we do not know about.\\"Andrew Cohen, Wrongful Convictions: A New Exoneration Registry Tests Stubborn Judges (May 21, 2012). The Atlantic. The registry and report includes cases of defendants convicted of crimes that never occurred, cases involving false confessions, and cases involving innocent defendants who pleaded guilty. The new report reveals many more exonerations than previously found. The National Registry of Exonerations is the largest and most detailed compilation of exoneration data ever made.Hilary Hurd Anyaso, Registry Tallies Exonerations Since 1989 (May 21, 2012). Northwestern University.David G. Savage, Registry tallies over 2,000 wrongful convictions since 1989 (May 20, 2012). Los Angeles Times. Data Exonerations may be browsed and sorted by name of the exonerated individual, state, county, year convicted, age of the exonerated individual at the time of conviction, race of the exonerated individual, year exonerated, crime for which falsely convicted, whether DNA evidence was involved in the exoneration, and factors that contributed to the wrongful conviction.Browse the Registry, National Registry of Exonerations. Race is the focus of a March 7, 2017, report that says, 'African Americans are only 13% of the American population but ... 47% of the 1,900 exonerations listed in the National Registry of Exonerations (as of October 2016), and the great majority of more than 1,800 additional innocent defendants who were framed and convicted of crimes in 15 large-scale police scandals and later cleared in 'group exonerations.' ... The main reason for this racial disproportion in convictions of innocent drug defendants is that police enforce drug laws more vigorously against African Americans than against members of the white majority, despite strong evidence that both groups use drugs at equivalent rates. African Americans are more frequently stopped, searched, arrested, and convicted‚Äîincluding in cases in which they are innocent. The extreme form of this practice is systematic racial profiling in drug-law enforcement. The registry also indicates whether a co-defendant or a person who might have been charged as a codefendant gave a confession that also implicated the exoneree and whether the false conviction case involved \\"shaken baby syndrome\\" or child sex abuse hysteria. The exoneration also includes a glossary of terms.Glossary, National Registry of Exonerations. For all exonerations listed in the original 873 cases identified, the most common were perjury or false accusation (51%), mistaken witness identification (43%), official misconduct (i.e., by police, prosecutors, or judges), false or misleading forensic evidence (24%) and false confession (16%). Inadequate legal defense also played a role in some cases of wrongful conviction.Jorge Rivas, 50 Percent of Those Exonerated in National Registry are Black, Color Lines (May 22, 2012). The exoneration data indicates that factors contributing to false convictions vary by crime. The largest contributor to false convictions for homicide is perjury, often by someone who claims to have witnessed the crime or participated in it, and false confessions. In rape cases, the largest contributor is eyewitness misidentification, frequently by white victims who misidentify black defendants. Witness mistakes are also present in the majority of false convictions for robbery, which has few exonerations because DNA evidence is rarely available in such cases. The report also indicates that child sex abuse exonerations are almost all because it is later determined that no crime occurred. By March 2017 the total on the Registry exceeded 2,000. A 2017 report highlighted that although African Americans form 13% of the American population, they accounted for 47% of the exonerations on the Registry. To which must be added most of the 1,800 additional innocent defendants who were framed and convicted of crimes in 15 large-scale police scandals and later cleared in \\"group exonerations.\\"  Potential victims of injustice  In 2014 a study involving the Registry found that 4% of those sentenced to death in the US turned out to be innocent. This 4% error rate has been extrapolated by commentators to the 2.2 million people in prison in the United States, giving them a figure of 88,000 innocent people behind bars, few of which have access to attorneys and innocence projects to appeal their cases.

The 6th Form also received the same classification. The school is aided by the Elizabeth Farmor Trust, founded in 2008. The trust assists the school by advancing the education of the pupils at the school.http://opencharities.org/charities/1123825 For example, in 2011, the trust helped fund new computer hardware for the school. Background The school was founded in 1738, using a gift by Miss Mary Barker and a bequest by Miss Elizabeth Farmor. When first opened, the school accepted only 50 boys from the town of Fairford. In 1852, the school began to accept girls in a separate section of the school. The school became co-educational in 1922, and the sections were combined under a single headmaster.

These people are all awaiting determination of their legal status in South Africa (or deportation). Due to an ever increasing burden on SAPS holding cells and the lack of detention capacity in the country‚Äôs prisons, the need for a repatriation centre in Gauteng was identified by the Department of Home Affairs. In 1996, Lindela was opened to meet this requirement. It claims to be compliant with all good governance and lawful criteria. The Department of Home Affairs is legally and administratively responsible for all matters pertaining to the apprehension, holding, processing, repatriation and release of illegal aliens at the Lindela repatriation centre. Detainees are repatriated and transported by Home Affairs, almost on a daily basis, to border posts or O. R. Tambo International Airport and Lanseria International Airport.

Q5's consultants consist of psychology PhDs and advertising, marketing and research professionals. Marvel had already used Q5 to develop their Defenders of the Earth series, so ABC brought them in for the 1987-88 season to improve its kid appeal on its Saturday morning offerings to get out of third place in the ratings. A Little Clowns former story editor indicated in September 1987 to the Los Angeles Times regarding Q5 consulting on the series: > They aren't merely researching trends; they're trying to engage in social > engineering. There's absolutely no passion with these people. There is no > sense of honor, of anger, of deep emotion, of love. They're bland-izers; > they try to hammer out all of the high and low points of being a human > being. I can see we're not doing Dostoevsky on Saturday morning, but there > has to be some leeway to create characters who are free to express > themselves. Fred Wolf and his Murakami Wolf Swenson were also brought in to produce the series. The show was promoted as a part of the third annual ABC Family Fun Fair, which brought the voice talent of the characters to perform highlights of their show. The show stopped in Oklahoma City from Friday August 28 through Sunday August 30, 1987. Reception The Los Angeles Times were critical of the show, with writer Charles Solomon saying that younger kids should have skipped it by staying in bed. They also claimed that the show was predictable and copied the Smurfs heavily, including using \\"clown\\" as a general word substitute. Joking Around With the Little Clowns During the show's run, ABC aired a series of short segments called Joking Around With the Little Clowns, which ran during the commercial breaks of their other Saturday morning programming and featured one of the clowns telling another a joke. Although Little Clowns of Happytown was cancelled after a single season, the Joking Around With the Little Clowns segments continued to run on ABC for another two years.

Design and development The Topaz is a development of the Ekolot JK-05L Junior and was designed to comply with the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale microlight rules. It features a cantilever high wing in place of the Junior's strut-braced wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. Like the Junior, the Topaz is made from composites. Its span wing employs an NN-1817 airfoil, has an area of and flaps. Dual fuel tanks are located behind the seats. A ballistic parachute is an available option. The standard engine available is the Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant. The use of a one-piece wing without struts gives the Topaz a higher cruise speed than the Junior, while resulting in the same empty weight. The Topaz has been accepted by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a light-sport aircraft.

Cutmore was primarily a middle-order batsman who played right-handed, making a total of almost 16,000 runs in 342 first-class matches at an average of 28.61; however, he also bowled on occasion, taking 11 wickets at an average of 62.45. Cutmore was born in Walthamstow, Essex (now in the London Borough of Waltham Forest). He made his Essex debut on 5 July 1924 in a home match against Surrey in the 1924 County Championship; coming in at number 7, he made 18 runs in the first innings and 29 in the second, as well as taking the second-innings wicket of William Abel with one of the four balls he bowled in the innings; Surrey won the match by 5 wickets. As his career continued, Cutmore rose up the Essex batting line-up, even opening the innings on occasion; in 1927, he opened the batting in an away match against Gloucestershire at Greenbank and went on to make his career best score of 238 not out before Essex declared on 578/6. By the end of his career, Cutmore had settled near the top of the middle-order. His final appearance came on 17 June 1936, away to Yorkshire; with Essex batting second, Cutmore came in at number 3 and made 21 runs before being trapped LBW by Bill Bowes; in the second innings, he opened the batting, but this time made only 13 runs before he was caught by Arthur Mitchell off the bowling of Hedley Verity. Cutmore died in Brentwood, Essex, on 30 November 1985 at the age of 86.

Between October 2015 and April 2017 he was Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. Early life and education Abdullah bin Faisal was born in Taif in 1951. His mother, Luluwah bint Abdulaziz, was a full sister of the Sudairi Seven. He is the oldest of six siblings. His brother, Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki, was killed in a car crash at age 41 on 23 July 2002 while coming from Jeddah to Riyadh to participate in funeral prayers for Prince Ahmed, son of Prince Salman, who has been the King of Saudi Arabia since 2015. Prince Abdullah is the brother-in-law of Prince Abdul Rahman bin Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud, Prince Sultan bin Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Prince Saud bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. Prince Abdullah's family on the father's side is directly descended from Saud bin Faisal. Saud's rule as well as that of his brother Abdullah witnessed civil war between these rulers leading to the end of the second Saudi state after an invasion of Ottomans early in the 19th century. Prince Abdullah received elementary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia. He then went to the United Kingdom for higher education where he studied engineering. Career and activities Following graduation Abdullah bin Faisal first worked at a factory in England. His early career as an engineer involved both technical and management positions in Saudi Arabia. He assumed the responsibility of the coordination of various studies for the two industrial cities, and later for the industrial security and safety sector. Abdullah bin Faisal was the acting secretary general between 1985 and 1987 at the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu immediately after established by King Khalid in 1975. Then, he was appointed secretary general of the royal commission in 1987. Next, he was appointed chairman of the body in 1991 and he served as chief executive officer of the commission and chairman of its board of directors. In April 2000 the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) was created, responsible for promotions of the foreign and domestic investments in Saudi Arabia. Prince Abdullah was appointed governor of SAGIA with the rank of minister in 2000. His tenure lasted until 2004 when he resigned from this post. It was speculated that since he was frustrated with the government‚Äôs bureaucratic approach and the slow pace of the reforms in the country, he left SAGIA. Prince Abdullah was the chairman of Saudi Italian Development Company (SIDCO), charged with the task of revitalizing Saudi Arabia's economy. Since he had knowledge of the Italian economy, he was regarded as the most appropriate figure to support the commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Italy. In October 2015 Prince Abdullah became the Saudi ambassador to the USA. He succeeded Adel al-Jubeir in the post. On 23 April 2017 Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud replaced Prince Abdullah as ambassador to the USA. SAGIA governorship When Prince Abdullah was the governor of SAGIA, he strongly supported both liberal policies and privatization in the Saudi Arabia‚Äôs economy. Nearly 2,000 foreign business licenses were issued during his tenure. The worth of these licenses were estimated to be 15 billion U.S. dollars. Prince Abdullah further encouraged the membership of Saudi Arabia to the World Trade Organization. However, this goal was not achieved at that time because of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs protectionist policies towards the industries of oil production and telecommunications, and its inability to produce a formal trade agreement with the United States. Personal life Abdullah bin Faisal is married and has four children: Turki, Salman, Al Anoud and Sarah. He is keenly interested in environmental issues and in international relations as well as in the arts.

One of the first fully annotated bibles to be issued as a part-work William Davison (1781‚Äì1858) was born in Alnwick. He was a pharmacist, apothecary, printer, engraver/etcher, bookseller, stationer, publisher, bookbinder, librarian/owner of a circulating library, and stereotyper/stereotype founder. His main employment became printing/publishing but he was always dedicated to social reform through education.  Early life  William Davison was born in Alnwick on 16 November 1781, the younger son of William (senior) and Mary. William was educated in Alnwick, and was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to Mr. Hind, a chemist in Ponteland, Newcastle. He returned to Alnwick in 1802 to set up business as a pharmacist, and in 1803 was for a short time in partnership with a printer (Joseph Perry). Wishing to enlarge his business, William placed an advert in the \\"Newcastle Courant\\" in 1804 indicating that his pharmacy now stocked books, paper, drawing materials and musical instruments in addition to the ointments etc. William was a very active and successful pharmacist and apothecary, and only entered into the world of printing accidentally, although he is probably best known for his printing, He actually came into printing at an opportune time, as there had only been five successful printers in Alnwick previously. He went into partnership with John Catnach. Catnach had only recently formed a new business after his original venture had gone into bankruptcy. The partnership between Davison and John Cannich ran under the name of Davison & Catnach from 1807‚Äì8, Davison's role appeared to be primarily that of financier whilst Catnach provided the contacts and technical expertise. The arrangement obviously didn't work as intended for either one or both the parties, and in less than 2 years it was dissolved leaving Davison publishing under his own account. But their edition of \\"The Poetic Works of Robert Burns\\" enjoyed such financial success as to warrant Davison issuing his new edition shortly after they parted. Early in his life as a printer, he started to use stereotyping, which was then not used generally. He also employed Thomas Bewick to illustrate his books and publications. About 1814 he opened a small foundry at his works in Bondgate Street, Alnwick, at which he produced the metal stereotypes. He also printed a trade catalogue which contains over a thousand impressions of wood-engravings, metal ornaments, ornamental borders and similar items. He worked very hard and was extremely innovative, publishing and printing his own products which included the broadsheets, small chapbooks, larger chapbooks, pamphlets, children's books, school books, guidebooks, books dealing with his own home town of Alnwick both guide books and history books, commercial billheads, advertising flyers, and everything else it seemed it was possible to print. Between around 1812 and 1817 he published a set of caricatures, (the total number is uncertain but probably almost 50), being small (approx. 233mm x 133mm or 9.5\\" x 5.5\\") single sheets with a topical subject shown in the, then newly, very popular caricature style. He failed in his attempt to produce a comprehensive history of the region, but his most significant works were probably his \\"splendid\\" (ref Isaac) Book of Common Prayer and his innovative folio Bible with copious commentaries originally sold in 100 parts at one shilling each. Although a financial disaster, the latter has been recognised as an innovative approach to supporting learning in the Christian faith. The copy of the Davison Bible on display at Bailiffgate Museum was hence designated as one of the Top 100 Objects in the NE of England in an initiative supported by Arts Council England in 2013.  Family  William Davison' father, also William (the elder), was a religious dissenter who lived in Alnwick with his second wife, Mary, the mother of at least one child. The parish records described William the elder as husbandman, gardener and farmer. William's own son, also a William, trained under him in the medical school set up in his pharmacy to become a doctor.  Later life and progressive principles  Hindley describes Davison as \\" ..what is now termed a Liberal, he had strong leanings to what was then known as the Progressive School.\\" Despite his own father having been a religious dissenter, William Davison himself was a churchwarden. He was on the committee responsible for the provision of a workhouse to accommodate the poor of Alnwick in 1810. Around 1815 the \\"Alnwick Dispensary\\" was founded ‚Äúfor the prompt and judicious aid of medicines and medical advice‚Äù (Isaac), and where Davison acted as apothecary. He was a subscriber to both the dispensary and the Alnwick Scientific and Mechanical Institution which had been founded in 1824. The medical school he set up in his pharmacy premises was noted throughout the North of England. Davison was also a pioneer in bringing gas to Alnwick. This process began in 1817 but initially does not seem to have been very successful. However, in 1825, Davison, along with another eight men of the town began with a new works in Canongate which continued to produce gas until 1882 when production was moved to another site in Alnwick. When Infant Schools became established in England in the 1830s pioneered by reformers such as Samuel Wilderspin, Davison was a major supplier nationally of educational ‚Äúchap‚Äù books; primers for new readers or illustrated short stories designed to stimulate young minds. On a sheet of foolscap paper eight panels of vignettes and text would be printed, then another eight on the reverse. Cut and folded they produced a child-size 16 page book which was cheap to produce and hence accessible to the masses. Although he produced a number of school textbooks, his most successful was his edition of Charles Hutton's Complete Treatise on Practical Arithmentic and Book-Keeping (1828) In 1854, at the age of 72 William Davison established the ‚ÄúAlnwick Mercury‚Äù . The first edition had a print run of just 1000 and cost one old Old Penny each. The paper was a success, remarkably so as the between 1827 and 1852 no less than 4 newspapers had been introduced and had failed, possibly due to the population being relatively small and in addition spread over a large area. William Davison's died in 1858. His son William took over the running of the business. And about a year later he sold the newspaper title, which changed to the \\"Alnwick and County Gazette\\" in 1883, by which time the circulation was several thousands. The paper is now published weekly as the \\"Northumberland Gazette\\"  Works  These include (this is not a complete list) :-  Books and pamphlets  Written by Davison = *Facsimile of the cover of first issue of the \\"Alnwick Mercury, Northumberland Advertiser, and Entertaining Miscellany\\" *A descriptive and historical view of Alnwick, the County Town of Northumberland, and of Alnwick Castle, Alwick & Hulne Abbeys, Brislee Tower, The Borough of Alnwick, Etc.. 1822 * The Northumbrian Minstrel ‚Äì 1811 = Printed and produced by Davison = * Prospectus for the History of Alnwick (Second edition) ‚Äì requesting anyone with any information to contact the publisher ‚Äì of 4 pages ‚Äì 1822 * Prospectus for a Prayer Book: \\"In the Press, and speedily will be published Price 6d ‚Äì requesting suggestions for inclusion ‚Äì 1817 * Tynemouth Priory ‚Äì 2 leaves folded to 235x189mm, carrying a small wood- engraved view of Tynemouth Priory c1840 * The Poetic Works of Robert Burns ‚Äì 270 pages ‚Äì 1808 * Prospectus for \\"The History of Northumberland ‚Äì 8 pages ‚Äì 1820 * Metrical Legends of Northumberland: containing the traditions of Dunstanborough Castle, and other poetical romances * A History of the Earth and Animated Nature by M. de Buffon, Goldsmith, and others * The Heart of Mid- Lothian ‚Äì 12 pages ‚Äì cost 1 penny * Day, a Pastoral in Three Parts, viz, Morning, Noon, and Evening to which is added \\"The Stubborn Dame\\" ‚Äì 36 pages * A natural history of reptiles, serpents and insects ‚Äì 36 pages * Poetical Works ‚Äì numerous editions and volumes between 1812 and c1817 * Poems and Songs c1828 * Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect both humorous And entertaining.

Lea√±os is director and author of the mariachi performance Imperial Silence: Una √ìpera Muerta (A Dead Opera in Four Acts) in collaboration with choreographer Joel Valent√≠n-Mart√≠nez and the Mariachi Ensemble Los Cuatro Vientos. This \\"dead opera\\" fuses dark-humored animation with Mexican baile folkl√≥rico, modern dance, traditional Mariachi music, hip- hop, and borderlands blues. From 2000 to 2004, Lea√±os was a part of artist collective Los Cybrids: La Raza Techno-Cr√≠itca, which critically engaged high technology from Latino perspectives. Their performance \\"El World Brain Disorder:surveillance.control.pendejismo\\" toured galleries and universities.John Jota Lea√±os' Website, Biography, June 3, 2012 Of Mexican- Italian-American descent, he identifies as part of the mainly hybrid tribe of Mexitaliano Xicangringo G√ºeros called \\"Los Mixtupos\\". Lea√±os received his M.F.A. in Photography from San Francisco State University in 2000. He has taught as an artist-in-residence at Carnegie Mellon University in the Art Department (2003) and at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in the Center for Chicano Studies (2005‚Äì2006). Lea√±os was an Assistant Professor of Chicana/o Studies at Arizona State University 2003-07 and an Assistant Professor of Social Practices and Community Arts at the California College of the Arts 2007-09.UCSC LALS Department Website, Affiliated Staff Members, June 3, 2012 Political Censorship In 2004 Lea√±os created two pieces that expressed his account on U.S. censorship and the \\"War on Terror\\". In the following works Lea√±os' use of digital imaging express personal views of the U.S. occupation in Iraq: Dead Conversations on Art and Politics In this piece Lea√±os is having an imaginary conversation with 19th-century Mexican artist and illustrator, Jos√© Guadalupe Posada (1851‚Äì1913). In this \\"dead conversation\\" Lea√±os fills Posada in on the current U.S. war in Iraq. Lea√±os explains to Posada that the U.S. military has committed sexual abuse crimes against Iraqi prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison. Lea√±os goes onto show Posada some of the few of many degrading photos that the U.S. government released in 2004 of the Iraqi prisoners.Dead Conversations on Art and Politics, Jose Guadalupe Posada interviews John Jota Lea√±os, June 5, 2012 Intellectual Freedom and Pat Tillman John Jota Lea√±os became the center of national controversy in October 2004 when he created a poster questioning the heroization of former football player Pat Tillman's death during his military service in Afghanistan. These are the comments of Lea√±os, assistant professor of Chicana/o art, before a forum on academic freedom at Arizona State University in early December. Lea√±os explains his piece on Tillman as \\"... a quiet piece. It is an emotional argument. It brings issues into question. It does not violently scream at you. It uses first person as an artistic strategy. It's a declaration from the dead.\\"Arizona State University State Forum, Intellectual Freedom and Pat Tillman, June 4, 2012 Decolonizing/Postcolonial space One of the main themes of Lea√±os' works is decolonization. According to Anibal Quijano, decolonization refers to the undoing of colonialism, either culturally or politically. Lea√±os has been involved with mural making and public artwork in places such as San Francisco's Mission district, in order to reclaim the public space. One of the more notable mural Lea√±os was a part of was Resist the Dot Con, which was done in collaboration with the Galeria de la Raza.With and Without Permission,The (Postcolonial) Rules of Engagement: Cultural Activism, Advertising Zones & Xican@ Digital Muralism, June 6, 2012 Many of Lea√±os' writings about decolonizing space tries to answer the burdening question of how do art tactics of reclaiming space differ from more conservative groups who set out to reclaim their streets. He has also contributed immensely to the reclaiming of public space in marginalized communities that were taken over by the dot- com era. Xican@ Lea√±os is one of many Chicanos who have identified as xican@, a recent modification of the word chican@. Jos√© Cuellar describes Xican @ in his entry on \\"Chicanismo/Xicanism@\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures: As a Xican@, Leanos strives to bring into light the varies social, political, and economic injustices that Chicanos face on a daily basis. One of the main differences Xican@s use to distinguish themselves from Chican@s, is that they do not claim to \\"'take back' the territory and rights that belong to 'us'\\", they argue that such a strategy ignores the hybrid cultures that all American urban spaces represent. Much like Xican@s, their murals are a hybrid of Mexican-American working class aesthetics, culture and politics.

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design‚Äîfrequently described as a movement or field‚Äîhas gained public recognition. History Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American civil rights leader Whitney Young issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention: \\". . . you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock. You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance.\\" The response to Young‚Äôs challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.Design Coalition, \\"Our Roots\\" CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities, provided a variety of design services ‚Äì such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods. In architecture schools, ‚Äúdesign/build programs‚Äù provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas. One of the earliest design/build programs was Yale University‚Äôs Vlock Building Project. The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing. One of the most publicized programs is the Auburn University Rural Studio design/build program, which was founded in 1993. The Rural Studio‚Äôs first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500. Public Interest Design from the 1990s ‚Äì Present Interest in public interest design ‚Äì particularly socially responsible architecture ‚Äì began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium. Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers, which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies. Non-profit organizations ‚Äì including Architecture for Humanity, BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, Public Architecture, Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group ‚Äì began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions. Many public interest design organizations also provide training and service-learning programs for architecture students and graduates. In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established, giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.Enterprise Community website, \\"About the Fellowship\\" Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the University of Texas .Overview of Public Interest Design program, University of Texas School of Architecture In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States. The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.Harvard School of Design course description Also in 2011, a survey of American Institute of Architects (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community. Conferences and exhibits The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world. The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called ‚ÄúDesign for the 98% Without Architects.\\" Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder Samuel Mockbee challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: ‚ÄúI believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.\\" In 2007, the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum held an exhibition, titled ‚ÄúDesign for the Other 90%,‚Äù curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the \\"Design Other 90\\" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled ‚ÄúDesign for the Other 90%: CITIES‚ÄùDesign for the Other 90%: CITIES (2011), held at the United Nations headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the Museum of Modern Art in New York curated an exhibit, called ‚ÄúSmall Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.MoMA Exhibition: \\"Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement\\"‚Äù Professional Networks One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.Association for Community Design website, \\"About\\" page In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders, during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria. In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by Architecture for Humanity in conjunction with co-founder Cameron Sinclair's TED Wish.Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the Creative Commons \\"some rights reserved\\" licensing system. In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched. In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition. In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human- centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end- user of a product, place, or system ‚Äî taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on \\"The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,\\"The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.
