It was last used in 1974, and the swing span was removed in 2001 leaving only two fixed truss spans.  History  The original structure was a covered bridge built in 1835 by Thomas Hassard for the Boston and Providence Railroad. He had been mentored by Colonel Stephen H. Long, inventor of the Long truss. It was the first interstate railroad bridge built in the United States. The bridge had a manually operated draw consisting of two parts located on the East Providence side of the bridge. In order to let a vessel pass, the eastern part had to be moved northward and the western part was moved into the vacated space. This draw was replaced in 1858 by one resting on a turntable providing a gap of . In 1866, due to the bridge's piers being deemed unreliable, work began on a new bridge adjacent to the existing one that was to have a draw of at least . This bridge used a Howe truss and was built by Daniel Harris and Richard Hawkins, who held the patent rights for this design in Southern New England. On 20 February 1868, a successful test run was made, and the main track was connected to the new bridge the following day. In 1882, an iron swing section replaced the manually operated one. This provided a channel of about . However, a curve in the channel made passage through it difficult. The remaining covered part of the bridge was replaced with a steel swing span in 1902 by Boston Bridge Works giving it a channel of approximately and aligning the draw with that of the 1885 Washington BridgeAt the time, the bridge was known as the \\"Seekonk River Bridge\\" but was eventually renamed to match its predecessors. to the north. Finally, the iron swing section was replaced with fixed pony trusses in 1903. Both of these sections were built around the existing spans, so that rail and water traffic would not be interrupted. During peak working hours, trains could cross the bridge at an average rate of one every four minutes.  Removal  The bridge continued to operate until 1974. After its closing, the United States Coast Guard eventually determined the bridge to be a navigational hazard. In May 1990, they threatened to fine the City of Providence US$1000 for each day beyond one year from then that the bridge was neither removed nor illuminated. Though the deadline passed, the Coast Guard delayed imposing any fines until at least 1993, when Federal money was to be made available for the bridge's removal. Under the plan, the Federal government and city were each to pay US$250,000 towards the cost of removing it. However, this plan was not executed. Also, the Water Resources Acts of 1986 and 1996 had each approved plans for removing the bridge, but these plans failed to come to fruition as well. On 18 December 2000, the Providence City Council approved the transfer of the bridge to the Federal Government. The United States Army Corps of Engineers then advertised to give the bridge to any organization that could demonstrate a suitable disposition for it. No claims were received, so demolition was scheduled to begin in October 2001. By then, the estimated removal cost had increased to US$668,690 which also had been agreed to be split evenly by the Army Corps and the city. At the end of December 2001, the swing span had been dismantled. The final step was to remove the concrete platform measuring in diameter that supported the swing section. As of February 2020, only the two fixed truss sections on the East Providence side remained. However, in the summer of 2019, the East Providence City Council had passed a resolution asking for federal help in removing these remaining sections. The Army Corps of Engineers responded by saying there is money in the fiscal year 2020 budget for an environmental review and design to remove it but not for the actual demolition costs.

The center for this veneration is at the San Hipolito Church in the city center, for centuries the only church with any space devoted to this saint. Although the church remains named for its original patron, the image of Judas Thaddaeus has been moved to the main altar. The church and some other locations in Mexico, receive thousands of devotees, mostly coming on the 28th of each month, especially October 28, the saint's feast day. The saint is officially associated with difficult circumstances, but more recently has been associated with delinquents, with the idea that the saint hears the petitions of both the good and the bad. Mexico City, especially its poorer areas, is filled with thousands of street shrines to San Judas Tadeo. Other areas with significant numbers of devotees include Michoacán, the State of Mexico, Mexicali and Monterrey. The saint Judas Thaddaeus (or San Judas Tadeo in Spanish) was one of the Twelve Apostles. A relative of Jesus, he was one of his first followers and after Christ's death, became an evangelizer. He was martyred along with Simon the Zealot, by decapitation with a hatchet. Depictions of this saint, especially in Mexico, include a medallion on the chest with Christ’s image (representing evangelism), a staff and a hatchet (reminder of martyrdom). He is considered to be a direct intercessor to Jesus Christ as a saint to appeal to in difficult and desperate situations and is credited with many miracles. Petitions often include help with personal problems, legal problems, work issues and family. He is also invoked to help find lost objects. Sometimes the petition can simply be that the situation does not get worse. Aspects of his veneration in Mexico Devotees in procession in Mexico City Devotion to Judas Thaddaeus is widespread in Mexico City and some other areas, especially among the poor, often referred to by the familiar diminutive San Juditas. Devotees also include police, truck drivers, manual laborers and some upper-class people such as college students, politicians, businesspeople and artists. The popularity of this saint is growing, especially among young people. Images can be seen at secular, popular events for youth, especially on the 28th of the month. This saint has also become popular with drug abusers and delinquents, with some even petitioning the saint to get away with a crime. According to Father José de Jesús Aguilar Valdés, a director of the radio and television service of the Archdiocese of Mexico, the association of the saint with criminals came from the illegal copying of his image from prints in Italy, which reversed the hand on which his staff is held from right to left. As the left often symbolizes evil in Catholicism, folk belief has Judas Tadeo as the saint of both the good and the bad, with idea that sometimes the \\"good\\" can act worse than the \\"bad.\\" Devotees of the saint may also venerate Santa Muerte and Jesús Malverde. However, unlike Santa Muerte and Jesús Malverde, veneration of Judas Thaddaeus receives support from the Catholic Church as a manifestation of folk religion in Latin America. The archdiocese celebrates the saint's day, and clarifies that Judas Thaddaeus is not a saint for delinquency or drug trafficking, nor related in any way to Santa Muerte. The Church considers these beliefs incompatible with doctrine. Although the Church denies this, UNAM researcher Héctor Castillo Berthier states that the Church uses this veneration to combat that of Santa Muerte. Josué Tinoco, a psychologist at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, states that the veneration is an option for marginalized youth who want to keep in the Catholic faith. San Hipólito Church, Mexico City San Hipólito Church, Mexico City The San Hipólito Church in the historic center of Mexico City is the most important center of the veneration of this saint. For three hundred years, it was the only church with a shrine to him. However, as Judas Thaddaeus grew in popularity, its image in this church also became more important until the image was elevated to the main altar in 1982. Although the church is officially dedicated to San Hipolito and maintains the name, it is the center of veneration of Judas Thaddaeus. The church is one of few which allows mass participation by drug addicts and those who have had problems with the law. Located in the Cuauhtémoc borough of Mexico City, with high crime rates, most who visit this church are poor, marginalized and young, generally between thirteen and twenty years of age. Most are also male although groups of females can be seen, and most of the young people attend with their group or gang (called “bandas” in Mexican Spanish). On the 28th of each month, masses are held in honor of this saint, which bring people to the church from all over the city. Most use public transportation but some will walk the entire way to the church, starting the night before. Most attendees have images of the saint with them from their homes, which can be anywhere from 20 cm to over a meter and a half in height, made of various materials. Those with small children sometimes dress them as the saint. Many devotees also carry red and white roses. For this monthly event, police are assigned to the area around the church, mostly to redirect traffic. October 28 is the saint's feast day, and the crowds in and around the church are much larger, reaching 80,000 to 90,000 people attending over fifteen masses. Celebrations begin the night before when devotees begin to arrive, mostly staying on Hidalgo Avenue, closed for the occasion. As time passes, these crowds will block Paseo de la Reforma as well, one of the city's main arteries. Police presence for this event numbers in the hundreds. On the feast day proper, the area around the church is one of the most crowded spots in the city, despite the cold temperatures. At 6am on October 28, the day begins with the singing of Las Mañanitas The church is surrounded by vendors year-round, selling candles, rosaries, other religious objects, t-shirts, candies and food. On the 28th of the month, vendors sell at least 2,000 figures of the saint to visitors. Other centers of veneration Mexico City is the main center of veneration to Judas Thaddaeus, with thousands of small street shrines, especially in older, lower- class neighborhoods such as Colonia Obrera. However, other areas with significant numbers of devotees include Michoacán, the State of Mexico, Puebla, Nuevo León and Baja California . Veneration of this saint is an important event on his feast day of October 28 in Mexicali and at the church dedicated to him on the Colonia Héctor Mayagoitia in the city of Durango. The saint has a sanctuary in the center of the city of Monterrey, which receives thousands of visitors each year, up to 75,000 for October 28. The sanctuary petitioned for and received a small piece of bone from the remains of Judas Thaddaeus buried in Rome.

This theme is often considered the starting point for the area of organocatalysis, even though early discoveries went unappreciated. Modifications, such as MacMillan’s catalyst and Jorgensen's catalysts, proceed with excellent stereocontrol. Proline catalysis was initially reported by groups at Schering AG and Hoffmann-La Roche. Proline's chiral structure enables enantioselective synthesis, favoring a particular enantiomer or diastereomer.  Reactions  The Hajos–Parrish–Eder–Sauer–Wiechert reaction, reported in 1971 by several research teams, is an early example of an enantioselective catalytic reaction in organic chemistry. Its scope has been modified and expanded through the development of related reactions including the Michael addition, asymmetric aldol reaction, and the Mannich reaction. This reaction has likewise been used to perform asymmetric Robinson annulations. The general scheme of this reaction follows: An enantioselective intramolecular aldol reaction. This example illustrates a 6-enolendo aldolization. In the , proline catalyses an asymmetric aldol reaction. The zwitterionic character and the H-bonding of proline in the transition state determine the reaction outcome. An enamine is formed during the reaction and only one proline molecule is involved in forming the transition state. Asymmetric synthesis of the Wieland-Miescher ketone is also based on proline. Additional reactions include aldol reactions, Mannich reaction, Michael reaction, amination, α-oxyamination, and α-halogenation. Modifications on the basic proline structure improved the enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of the catalysis. These proline-derived auxiliaries and catalysts, including the Enders hydrazone reaction and Corey–Itsuno reduction, have been reviewed, as have MacMillan’s iminium catalysts, Miller catalysts, and CBS- oxazaborolidines. Illustrating an enolexo intramolecular aldolization, dicarbonyl (dials,diketones) can be converted to anti-aldol products with a 10% L-proline catalyst loading. Intramolecular aldolization of a dialdehyde via an enamine intermediate. A prominent example of proline catalysis is the addition of acetone or hydroxyacetone to a diverse set of aldehydes catalyzed by 20-30% proline catalyst loading with high (>99%) enantioselectivity yielding diol products. As refined by List and Notz, the aforementioned reaction produces diol products as follows: Proline-catalyzed asymmetric aldol reaction Mechanistic considerations Proline-catalyzed aldol additions proceed via a six-membered enamine transition state according to the Zimmerman-Traxler model. Addition of 20-30 mol% proline to acetone or hydroxyacetone catalyzes their addition to a diverse set of aldehydes with high (>99%) enantioselectivity yielding diol products. Proline and proline derivatives have been implemented as organocatalysts to promote asymmetric condensation reactions. An example of such a reaction proceeding through a six membered transition state is modelled as follows. A six-membered transition state in asymmetric proline catalysis. Intramolecular aldolization reactions that are catalyzed by proline likewise go through six-membered transition states. These transition states can enable the formation of either the enolexo or the enolendo product. The chair transition state controls, in part, whether the enolexo or the enolendo product forms.

The event, held in a large warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York, served as an album release party and included a press conference and a live performance. During the press conference, Gaga revealed \\"the world's first flying dress\\", called the Volantis, confirmed plans to stage a performance in space in 2015, and introduced new works by Marina Abramović, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Jeff Koons, and Robert Wilson. The warehouse contained a giant statue of Gaga created by Koons on one side and other artworks, while screens all around displayed videos of Gaga's performances with Abramović. There were contortionists, a DJ booth, as well as free food and drink for the assembled crowd. The event was to have been sponsored by American Express, however they backed out at the last moment failing to come to terms regarding ArtRave's production. Gaga performed a concert which was streamed live on Vevo and later rebroadcast through the website's syndication partners. The set list consisted of songs from Artpop. On November 11, Clear Channel aired a half-hour special called Album Release Party with Lady Gaga, hosted by Ryan Seacrest on more than 150 radio stations throughout the United States. On November 19, The CW aired a television special with footage from the album release party. ArtRave received generally positive reviews from critics who noted the enormity of the production, as well as Gaga's performance and enthusiasm; the launch of Volantis was generally criticised. Background and conception Development of Lady Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, began shortly after the release of her second one, Born This Way in 2011. By the following year, Gaga started collaborating with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. In the meantime, she began presenting tracks to her record company and hoped to announce the album's working title by September 2013; a revelation that was actually disclosed one month earlier. The artist later claimed that Artpop was her first \\"real album\\" comparing herself to a \\"phoenix rising from the ashes\\", which reflected her heightened confidence in writing material for the album compared to her previous efforts. Gaga recruited artist Jeff Koons for the project in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga \\"just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave me a big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'.\\" In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which \\"combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community.\\" A public announcement, posted on July 12, 2013, revealed plans for an ArtRave event the night before the release of Artpop, unveiling projects Gaga had been working on in collaboration with her creative team, the Haus of Gaga, Dutch photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, avant -garde theater director Robert Wilson, performance artist Marina Abramović, and Koons. The announcement featured Gaga covering her bare breasts with her arms, with her forearm \\"Artpop\\" tattoo in plain sight, wearing a visor designed by London College of Fashion alumna Isabell Yalda Hellysaz. Another promotional image showed Gaga with long brown hair, sporting a pair of spectacles, sitting completely naked on a chair crafted from motherboards as she displays her unicorn thigh tattoo. Development and sponsors alt=A faraway image of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The event was held at the reportedly \\"top secret\\" Duggal Greenhouse, a large warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. It spanned two days, starting with a press conference on November 10 and extending into the morning of November 11, 2013, the album's release date in the United States. New York's OneNine Design company was responsible for the event planning and the production. Gaga also employed the Roschman Dance group to perform during the party and the event. The interior of the yard was strewn with art pieces and art works. There was a food truck and open bar, and at one end there was a white stage with a spiral staircase. Opposite the stage, across the room, stood a giant statue of Gaga depicted naked, with her hands covering the breasts, created by Koons. In between her spread legs, Koons' characteristic blue gazing ball was placed; the statue was photographed and used in the album cover design for Artpop. Between the stage and the Gaga sculpture stood four other statues created by Koons In flagrante delicto, as well as the open bars where contortionists performed their intricate moves. The area was surrounded by large video screens which displayed Gaga's work with Abramović (showing the singer stumbling through a forest naked), Inez and Vinoodh, as well as with Wilson. Adjacent to the main space, there was a side area which featured an art installation called Binary Room, by artist Benjamin Rollins Caldwell, consisting of a room with all the furniture and flooring made up of old computer parts. Another room was dedicated to the display and usage of the Artpop app, as well as the fashions created by the Haus of Gaga for the ArtRave. There were personnel dressed in matching future-esque uniforms to walkthrough the app and its uses, including \\"the ability to read auras, create animated 3D Gifs and remix Gaga's music.\\" ArtRave was an \\"extravagant spectacle\\" according to Billboards Andrew Hampp. However, he also noted that though the event did not have any sponsors, Gaga \\"was part of a select group of artists who have firmly thrown their branding lot in with the tech–music innovation space\\". Projects like Creators with Vice and Intel, as well as artists like will.i.am, Jay-Z and Björk were cited as precedents for crafting events and merging music and technology with art. Gaga, who had been named a creative director of Polaroid Corporation in 2010, had been involved in technical projects like Backplane with her former manager Troy Carter; Gaga separated from Carter a few days before the ArtRave. But Hampp believed that the explicit nature of the art works and the videos being shown had deprived Gaga of the opportunity of any \\"overt\\" sponsorship for the event. He explained that Billboard had reached out to three executives from American Express (AmEx), the company which was supposed to sponsor ArtRave but had \\"backed out\\" due to creative differences. Speaking off the record, the executives confirmed that AmEx had been slated to bear the expenses of the event as well as the live streaming. They later issued an apology statement: > American Express had been in discussions to potentially live stream Lady > Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. American Express decided > not to proceed with the live stream because of an inability to reach a > mutual agreement on the production of the event. However, American Express > honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to > proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an > incredible artist and we hope to work together in the future. Press conference Gaga hosted a press conference, where she introduced Volantis, a battery-powered vehicle described as \\"the world's first flying dress.\\" The white vehicle, described by Entertainment Weekly as a \\"hover dress\\", features a central column to which the wearer is clamped by a safety harness, in turn covered by a white plastic \\"dress\\". The column also houses the batteries and other equipment. Six lifting fan units are mounted on booms in a hexagonal formation radiating from the top of the column, giving the device the ability to hover three feet above the ground. The dress was designed by TechHaus, the Haus of Gaga's technology branch, and it took them two years to create. Gaga promoted the dress by tweeting earlier in the day, \\"At 6pm EST today we will beta test Volantis with the world. We invite you into our creative process during her initial stages of lift off.\\" For the demonstration, she transitioned from a white astronaut suit down to black tights and a black body wrap. According to Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media, \\"[Volantis] roared to life and lurched forward a few feet, hovering. Then it did the same thing, backwards. Then it stopped. That was it.\\" Hampp reported that \\"one attendee disparagingly referred to [it] as a 'Zamboni with fans'.\\" Gaga quipped that the dress was \\"maybe a small step for Volantis... but a big- time step\\" for her. The singer also announced plans to stage the first musical performance from space, following previous reports about her singing at Zero G Colony, a music festival scheduled to occur at Spaceport America in New Mexico in 2015. The concert was later cancelled when a test flight for the project crashed. Concert and broadcast Gaga performing on ArtRave Following the press conference, Gaga performed a live-streamed concert that included songs from Artpop. She appeared at 12:45 a.m., more than an hour after her expected start time of 11:30 p.m. Traffic overload to the music video website Vevo, which had exclusive rights to broadcast the concert portion of the event, was given as the reason for her delay. Following the site's crash, Gaga tweeted, \\"We're working on fixing the Livestream, there's A LOT of traffic. If Vevo does not work in your territory, fear not, we're posting video.\\" Subsequently, she posted of her fans: \\"Only little monsters can crash Vevo. *face palm*.\\" The live broadcast was available on-demand through various Vevo platforms in the: United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Immediately following the initial broadcast, which began at 11:30 p.m. on November 10, the event was rebroadcast continuously for 48 hours. Prior to the official concert, DJs Madeon, White Shadow and Lady Starlight played for the crowd. The concert started with Gaga performing two songs, beginning with \\"Aura\\". The set list also included choreographed performances of \\"Manicure\\" and \\"Sexxx Dreams\\", followed by \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Dope\\" with a live band. \\"Applause\\" and \\"Do What U Want\\" served as an encore; R. Kelly's vocals from the latter song were supplied by a backing track. Koons' sculpture of Gaga served as her backdrop. The stage and the performers' costumes were solid white. Gaga wore a \\"clown-like\\" white mask with black-and-white buoys. It was designed by Gareth Pugh for his Spring/Summer 2007 collection, and was the dress that had made him famous. She also made other costume changes throughout the night, including a set of three dresses during her performance of \\"Applause\\". On November 11, Clear Channel broadcast a half-hour special called Album Release Party with Lady Gaga, hosted by Ryan Seacrest, and available on more than 150 radio stations throughout the United States. Video on demand access was available through Vevo's syndication partners, including YouTube, beginning on November 14. The CW aired a television special with footage from the album release party on November 19. Critical reception alt=A model walks on a runaway wearing a white dress with black stalkings. The dress has inflatable small white cushions on it, and the model is wearing a white and black mask. Amy Phillips of Pitchfork Media commended Gaga's performance saying that it was \\"amazing as usual – a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in – that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being.\\" Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to \\"top\\" the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle. Billboard Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a \\"bizarro\\" version of Jack Box, the mascot for Jack in the Box, and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was \\"more pop art than artistic pop music.\\" Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, \\"Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and high art at a party.\\" Michael Baggs of Gigwise described the concert as \\"sparse but impressive\\" and wrote that Gaga appeared \\"wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Marisa G. Muller noted that Gaga spoke of the artists and the personnel involved with the event continuously throughout the night, and \\"[despite] being more than an hour late, Gaga made her tight-knit audience of little monsters feel special... Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak.\\" David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a \\"blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions that make you think about the nature of philosophy and life and art.\\" He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Do What U Want\\", and deduced that: \\"Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun.\\" Carl Swanson of New York magazine was amazed by the ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that \\"[the] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras as well as those of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it.\\" However, he noticed a bit of \\"vulnerability\\" in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as \\"borderline gibberish\\", adding that: \\"It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind.\\" Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that \\"[o]nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness.\\" Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the \\"underwhelming display\\" of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about \\"changing the world\\" with the album and the technology were \\"both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [Gaga] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'.\\" Set list # \\"Aura\\" # \\"Artpop\\" # \\"Venus\\" # \\"Manicure\\" # \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" # \\"Gypsy\\" # \\"Dope\\" # \\"Applause\\" Encore # * \\"Do What U Want\\" Source: See also * 2013 in art * 2013 in aviation * Performance art References External links * Gaga's 'Artpop' Party, CBS New York * 10 Things No One Told You About Lady Gaga's artRave Complex * Scenes from Lady Gaga's ArtRave at Brooklyn Navy Yard Paper 2013 in American music 2013 in art 2013 in fashion 2013 in New York City Brooklyn Navy Yard Concerts in the United States Events in New York City Lady Gaga ","title":"ArtRave"},{"id":"41228487","text":"Paris Plane is a 1933 British crime film directed by John Paddy Carstairs and starring John Loder, Molly Lamont and Allan Jeayes.Paris Plane at NY Times It was made at Shepperton Studios as a quota quickie.79 Plot A Scotland Yard detective pursues a murderer aboard a Paris bound Hercules plane.

All fifty states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Mississippi voters chose seven electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Mississippi was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Mississippi, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican. The vast majority of counties in Mississippi voted in majority for Reagan, a particularly strong turn out, even in this typically conservative-leaning state. A notable exception is the counties bordering the Mississippi River itself, which tended to vote Democratic during this time. In fact, in Jefferson County, possessing the largest African-American share of any United States county's population, Mondale received 77.94% of the vote, a proportion exceeded only by the District of Columbia, Macon in Alabama, and Native American Shannon County in South Dakota.Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; 1984 Presidential Election Statistics Mississippi weighed in for this election as 3% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which the following counties voted for a Republican presidential candidate: Clay, Issaquena, Jefferson Davis, Sunflower, and Tallahatchie.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory A Reagan-Bush Rally in Gulfport, Mississippi on October 1, 1984. Reagan won the election in Mississippi with a resounding 24 point sweep-out landslide. Mississippi continued its trend of voting for the same presidential candidate as its sister Dixie State Alabama this election cycle – a trend which has remained unbroken since 1872.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Alabama voters chose 9 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Alabama was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Alabama, with just under 99 percent of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican. The majority of counties in Alabama voted for Reagan, in a particularly strong turn out in this typically conservative leaning state. Typical for the time, the almost entirely African-American counties of the Black Belt turned out overwhelmingly for Mondale: in Macon County, Mondale received 82.71% of the vote, which was the highest percentage he received in any county nationwide outside the District of Columbia.Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections; 1984 Presidential Election Statistics Mondale also carried Colbert, Lawrence and Jackson counties in northern Alabama, which had continued to be more receptive to Democrats, even as the rest of the state, especially the Gulf Coast and the suburbs around Birmingham had already trended strongly Republican. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Alabama with a resounding 22 point sweep-out landslide. While Alabama typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in Alabama are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. Also, Alabama continued its trend of voting for the same presidential candidate as its sister Dixie State Mississippi this election cycle – a trend which has remained unbroken since 1872. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\"Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Alabama, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with the USSR, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan’s 1984 landslide victory, in Alabama and elsewhere.

Politics Çiljeta is self-declared as being a supporter of the Democratic Party of Albania, and its leader Lulzim Basha. Earlier, she had sung in New York, in a party organized by Red and Black Alliance, now an extinguished party, but declared that she was unaware of who the organizer of the party was. She notably had two public reactions against Serbia and Greece politicians: to Serbia after the Serbian government removed a memorial to the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac in Preševo, an Albanian- inhabited region of Serbia. The second reaction was to Greece, after she saw in television an anti-Albanian interview of Christos Pappas, a politician of the Golden Dawn, a Greek far-right political party. After these declarations, the Greek media attacked her, saying that she claims to be a singer, but must be something else, and published provoking photos of Çiljeta. Humanitarian activities On March 20, 2012 Çiljeta was reported by the media to visit a correctional facility for minors, where she met 38 children, a meeting organised by the Institute of Minors, Kavaje, the Centre for the Human Rights of Children of Albania, and UNICEF.

In an internal combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion applies direct force to some component of the engine. The force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, rotor or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful work. The first commercially successful internal combustion engine was created by Étienne Lenoir around 1860 and the first modern internal combustion engine was created in 1876 by Nicolaus Otto (see Otto engine). The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described. Firearms are also a form of internal combustion engine , though of a type so specialized that they are commonly treated as a separate category. In contrast, in external combustion engines, such as steam or Stirling engines, energy is delivered to a working fluid not consisting of, mixed with, or contaminated by combustion products. Working fluids for external combustion engines include air, hot water, pressurized water or even liquid sodium, heated in a boiler. ICEs are usually powered by energy-dense fuels such as gasoline or diesel fuel, liquids derived from fossil fuels. While there are many stationary applications, most ICEs are used in mobile applications and are the dominant power supply for vehicles such as cars, aircraft, and boats, known as internal-combustion-engine vehicles (ICEV). Typically an ICE is fed with fossil fuels like natural gas or petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel or fuel oil. There is a growing usage of renewable fuels like biodiesel for CI (compression ignition) engines and bioethanol or methanol for SI (spark ignition) engines. Hydrogen is sometimes used, and can be obtained from either fossil fuels or renewable energy.  History  Various scientists and engineers contributed to the development of internal combustion engines. In 1791, John Barber developed the gas turbine. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794, Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use liquid fuel, and built an engine around that time. In 1798, John Stevens built the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, Swiss engineer François Isaac de Rivaz invented a hydrogen-based internal combustion engine and powered the engine by electric spark. In 1808, De Rivaz fitted his invention to a primitive working vehicle – \\"the world's first internal combustion powered automobile\\". In the same year, French engineers Nicéphore Niépce (who went on to invent photography) and Claude Niépce ran a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the Pyréolophore. This engine powered a boat on the Saône river, France. In 1823, Samuel Brown patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially. In 1854 in the UK, the Italian inventors Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci obtained the certification: \\"Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gases\\". In 1857 the Great Seal Patent Office conceded them patent No.1655 for the invention of an \\"Improved Apparatus for Obtaining Motive Power from Gases\\". Barsanti and Matteucci obtained other patents for the same invention in France, Belgium and Piedmont between 1857 and 1859. In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, Nicolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine. In 1876, Nicolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gasoline engine. Later, in 1886, Benz began the first commercial production of motor vehicles with the internal combustion engine. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the Heinkel He 178 became the world's first jet aircraft.  Etymology  At one time, the word engine (via Old French, from Latin ingenium, \\"ability\\") meant any piece of machinery—a sense that persists in expressions such as siege engine. A \\"motor\\" (from Latin motor, \\"mover\\") is any machine that produces mechanical power. Traditionally, electric motors are not referred to as \\"engines\\"; however, combustion engines are often referred to as \\"motors\\". (An electric engine refers to a locomotive operated by electricity.) In boating, an internal combustion engine that is installed in the hull is referred to as an engine, but the engines that sit on the transom are referred to as motors.  Applications  Reciprocating engine of a car Diesel generator for backup power Reciprocating piston engines are by far the most common power source for land and water vehicles, including automobiles, motorcycles, ships and to a lesser extent, locomotives (some are electrical but most use Diesel engines). Rotary engines of the Wankel design are used in some automobiles, aircraft and motorcycles. These are collectively known as internal-combustion-engine vehicles (ICEV). Where high power-to-weight ratios are required, internal combustion engines appear in the form of combustion turbines or Wankel engines. Powered aircraft typically uses an ICE which may be a reciprocating engine. Airplanes can instead use jet engines and helicopters can instead employ turboshafts; both of which are types of turbines. In addition to providing propulsion, airliners may employ a separate ICE as an auxiliary power unit. Wankel engines are fitted to many unmanned aerial vehicles. ICEs drive large electric generators that power electrical grids. They are found in the form of combustion turbines with a typical electrical output in the range of some 100 MW. Combined cycle power plants use the high temperature exhaust to boil and superheat water steam to run a steam turbine. Thus, the efficiency is higher because more energy is extracted from the fuel than what could be extracted by the combustion engine alone. Combined cycle power plants achieve efficiencies in the range of 50% to 60%. In a smaller scale, stationary engines like Gas engine or Diesel generators are used for backup or for providing electrical power to areas not connected to an electric grid. Small engines (usually 2‐stroke gasoline engines) are a common power source for lawnmowers, string trimmers, chain saws, leafblowers, pressure washers, snowmobiles, jet skis, outboard motors, mopeds, and motorcycles.  Classification  There are several possible ways to classify internal combustion engines.  Reciprocating  By number of strokes: * Two-stroke engine ** Clerk cycle ** Day cycle * Four-stroke engine (Otto cycle) * Six- stroke engine By type of ignition: * Compression-ignition engine * Spark- ignition engine (commonly found as gasoline engines) By mechanical/thermodynamic cycle (these 2 cycles do not encompass all reciprocating engines, and are infrequently used): * Atkinson cycle * Miller cycle  Rotary  * Wankel engine  Continuous combustion  * Gas turbine engine **Turbojet, through a propelling nozzle ** Turbofan, through a duct-fan ** Turboprop, through an unducted propeller, usually with variable pitch ** Turboshaft, a gas turbine optimized for producing mechanical torque instead of thrust * Ramjet , similar to a turbojet but uses vehicle speed to compress (ram) the air instead of a compressor. *Scramjet, a variant of the ramjet that uses supersonic combustion. *Rocket engine  Reciprocating engines   Structure  Bare cylinder block of a V8 engine Piston, piston ring, gudgeon pin and connecting rod The base of a reciprocating internal combustion engine is the engine block, which is typically made of cast iron or aluminium. The engine block contains the cylinders. In engines with more than one cylinder they are usually arranged either in 1 row (straight engine) or 2 rows (boxer engine or V engine); 3 rows are occasionally used (W engine) in contemporary engines, and other engine configurations are possible and have been used. Single cylinder engines are common for motorcycles and in small engines of machinery. Water-cooled engines contain passages in the engine block where cooling fluid circulates (the water jacket). Some small engines are air-cooled, and instead of having a water jacket the cylinder block has fins protruding away from it to cool by directly transferring heat to the air. The cylinder walls are usually finished by honing to obtain a cross hatch, which is better able to retain the oil. A too rough surface would quickly harm the engine by excessive wear on the piston. The pistons are short cylindrical parts which seal one end of the cylinder from the high pressure of the compressed air and combustion products and slide continuously within it while the engine is in operation. The top wall of the piston is termed its crown and is typically flat or concave. Some two-stroke engines use pistons with a deflector head. Pistons are open at the bottom and hollow except for an integral reinforcement structure (the piston web). When an engine is working, the gas pressure in the combustion chamber exerts a force on the piston crown which is transferred through its web to a gudgeon pin. Each piston has rings fitted around its circumference that mostly prevent the gases from leaking into the crankcase or the oil into the combustion chamber. A ventilation system drives the small amount of gas that escapes past the pistons during normal operation (the blow-by gases) out of the crankcase so that it does not accumulate contaminating the oil and creating corrosion. In two-stroke gasoline engines the crankcase is part of the air–fuel path and due to the continuous flow of it they do not need a separate crankcase ventilation system. Valve train above a Diesel engine cylinder head. This engine uses rocker arms but no pushrods. The cylinder head is attached to the engine block by numerous bolts or studs. It has several functions. The cylinder head seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons; it contains short ducts (the ports) for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape. However, 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves; the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead. The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection. All CI engines use fuel injection, usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection. SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection. Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2. A head gasket prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block. The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs—or in some engines—a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs. The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm, again, either directly or through a pushrod. Engine block seen from below. The cylinders, oil spray nozzle and half of the main bearings are clearly visible. The crankcase is sealed at the bottom with a sump that collects the falling oil during normal operation to be cycled again. The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a crankshaft that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion. The crankshaft is held in place relative to the engine block by main bearings, which allow it to rotate. Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing; the other half is a detachable cap. In some cases a single main bearing deck is used rather than several smaller caps. A connecting rod is connected to offset sections of the crankshaft (the crankpins) in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft. The end of the connecting rod attached to the gudgeon pin is called its small end, and the other end, where it is connected to the crankshaft, the big end. The big end has a detachable half to allow assembly around the crankshaft. It is kept together to the connecting rod by removable bolts. The cylinder head has an intake manifold and an exhaust manifold attached to the corresponding ports. The intake manifold connects to the air filter directly, or to a carburetor when one is present, which is then connected to the air filter. It distributes the air incoming from these devices to the individual cylinders. The exhaust manifold is the first component in the exhaust system. It collects the exhaust gases from the cylinders and drives it to the following component in the path. The exhaust system of an ICE may also include a catalytic converter and muffler. The final section in the path of the exhaust gases is the tailpipe.  4-stroke engines  Diagram showing the operation of a 4-stroke SI engine. Labels: 1 ‐ Induction 2 ‐ Compression 3 ‐ Power 4 ‐ Exhaust The top dead center (TDC) of a piston is the position where it is nearest to the valves; bottom dead center (BDC) is the opposite position where it is furthest from them. A stroke is the movement of a piston from TDC to BDC or vice versa, together with the associated process. While an engine is in operation, the crankshaft rotates continuously at a nearly constant speed. In a 4-stroke ICE, each piston experiences 2 strokes per crankshaft revolution in the following order. Starting the description at TDC, these are: # Intake, induction or suction: The intake valves are open as a result of the cam lobe pressing down on the valve stem. The piston moves downward increasing the volume of the combustion chamber and allowing air to enter in the case of a CI engine or an air fuel mix in the case of SI engines that do not use direct injection. The air or air-fuel mixture is called the charge in any case. # Compression: In this stroke, both valves are closed and the piston moves upward reducing the combustion chamber volume which reaches its minimum when the piston is at TDC. The piston performs work on the charge as it is being compressed; as a result its pressure, temperature and density increase; an approximation to this behavior is provided by the ideal gas law. Just before the piston reaches TDC, ignition begins. In the case of a SI engine, the spark plug receives a high voltage pulse that generates the spark which gives it its name and ignites the charge. In the case of a CI engine the fuel injector quickly injects fuel into the combustion chamber as a spray; the fuel ignites due to the high temperature. # Power or working stroke: The pressure of the combustion gases pushes the piston downward, generating more work than it required to compress the charge. Complementary to the compression stroke, the combustion gases expand and as a result their temperature, pressure and density decreases. When the piston is near to BDC the exhaust valve opens. The combustion gases expand irreversibly due to the leftover pressure—in excess of back pressure, the gauge pressure on the exhaust port—; this is called the blowdown. # Exhaust: The exhaust valve remains open while the piston moves upward expelling the combustion gases. For naturally aspirated engines a small part of the combustion gases may remain in the cylinder during normal operation because the piston does not close the combustion chamber completely; these gases dissolve in the next charge. At the end of this stroke, the exhaust valve closes, the intake valve opens, and the sequence repeats in the next cycle. The intake valve may open before the exhaust valve closes to allow better scavenging.  2-stroke engines  The defining characteristic of this kind of engine is that each piston completes a cycle every crankshaft revolution. The 4 processes of intake, compression, power and exhaust take place in only 2 strokes so that it is not possible to dedicate a stroke exclusively for each of them. Starting at TDC the cycle consist of: # Power: While the piston is descending the combustion gases perform work on it, as in a 4-stroke engine. The same thermodynamic considerations about the expansion apply. # Scavenging: Around 75° of crankshaft rotation before BDC the exhaust valve or port opens, and blowdown occurs. Shortly thereafter the intake valve or transfer port opens. The incoming charge displaces the remaining combustion gases to the exhaust system and a part of the charge may enter the exhaust system as well. The piston reaches BDC and reverses direction. After the piston has traveled a short distance upwards into the cylinder the exhaust valve or port closes; shortly the intake valve or transfer port closes as well. # Compression: With both intake and exhaust closed the piston continues moving upwards compressing the charge and performing a work on it. As in the case of a 4-stroke engine, ignition starts just before the piston reaches TDC and the same consideration on the thermodynamics of the compression on the charge. While a 4-stroke engine uses the piston as a positive displacement pump to accomplish scavenging taking 2 of the 4 strokes, a 2-stroke engine uses the last part of the power stroke and the first part of the compression stroke for combined intake and exhaust. The work required to displace the charge and exhaust gases comes from either the crankcase or a separate blower. For scavenging, expulsion of burned gas and entry of fresh mix, two main approaches are described: Loop scavenging, and Uniflow scavenging, SAE news published in the 2010s that 'Loop Scavenging' is better under any circumstance than Uniflow Scavenging. = Crankcase scavenged = Diagram of a crankcase scavenged 2-stroke engine in operation Some SI engines are crankcase scavenged and do not use poppet valves. Instead the crankcase and the part of the cylinder below the piston is used as a pump. The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when the crankcase pressure is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in the crankcase is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port, blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2-stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios. Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions: * They use a total-loss lubrication system: all the lubricating oil is eventually burned along with the fuel. * There are conflicting requirements for scavenging: On one side, enough fresh charge needs to be introduced in each cycle to displace almost all the combustion gases but introducing too much of it means that a part of it gets in the exhaust. * They must use the transfer port(s) as a carefully designed and placed nozzle so that a gas current is created in a way that it sweeps the whole cylinder before reaching the exhaust port so as to expel the combustion gases, but minimize the amount of charge exhausted. 4-stroke engines have the benefit of forcibly expelling almost all of the combustion gases because during exhaust the combustion chamber is reduced to its minimum volume. In crankcase scavenged 2-stroke engines, exhaust and intake are performed mostly simultaneously and with the combustion chamber at its maximum volume. The main advantage of 2-stroke engines of this type is mechanical simplicity and a higher power-to-weight ratio than their 4-stroke counterparts. Despite having twice as many power strokes per cycle, less than twice the power of a comparable 4-stroke engine is attainable in practice. In the US, 2-stroke engines were banned for road vehicles due to the pollution. Off-road only motorcycles are still often 2-stroke but are rarely road legal. However, many thousands of 2-stroke lawn maintenance engines are in use. = Blower scavenged = Diagram of uniflow scavenging Using a separate blower avoids many of the shortcomings of crankcase scavenging, at the expense of increased complexity which means a higher cost and an increase in maintenance requirement. An engine of this type uses ports or valves for intake and valves for exhaust, except opposed piston engines, which may also use ports for exhaust. The blower is usually of the Roots-type but other types have been used too. This design is commonplace in CI engines, and has been occasionally used in SI engines. CI engines that use a blower typically use uniflow scavenging. In this design the cylinder wall contains several intake ports placed uniformly spaced along the circumference just above the position that the piston crown reaches when at BDC. An exhaust valve or several like that of 4-stroke engines is used. The final part of the intake manifold is an air sleeve which feeds the intake ports. The intake ports are placed at a horizontal angle to the cylinder wall (I.e: they are in plane of the piston crown) to give a swirl to the incoming charge to improve combustion. The largest reciprocating IC are low speed CI engines of this type; they are used for marine propulsion (see marine diesel engine) or electric power generation and achieve the highest thermal efficiencies among internal combustion engines of any kind. Some Diesel-electric locomotive engines operate on the 2-stroke cycle. The most powerful of them have a brake power of around 4.5 MW or 6,000 HP. The EMD SD90MAC class of locomotives are an example of such. The comparable class GE AC6000CW whose prime mover has almost the same brake power uses a 4-stroke engine. An example of this type of engine is the Wärtsilä- Sulzer RT-flex96-C turbocharged 2-stroke Diesel, used in large container ships. It is the most efficient and powerful reciprocating internal combustion engine in the world with a thermal efficiency over 50%. For comparison, the most efficient small four-stroke engines are around 43% thermally-efficient (SAE 900648); size is an advantage for efficiency due to the increase in the ratio of volume to surface area. See the external links for a in-cylinder combustion video in a 2-stroke, optically accessible motorcycle engine. =Historical design= Dugald Clerk developed the first two cycle engine in 1879. It used a separate cylinder which functioned as a pump in order to transfer the fuel mixture to the cylinder. In 1899 John Day simplified Clerk's design into the type of 2 cycle engine that is very widely used today. Day cycle engines are crankcase scavenged and port timed. The crankcase and the part of the cylinder below the exhaust port is used as a pump. The operation of the Day cycle engine begins when the crankshaft is turned so that the piston moves from BDC upward (toward the head) creating a vacuum in the crankcase/cylinder area. The carburetor then feeds the fuel mixture into the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve (driven by the engine). There are cast in ducts from the crankcase to the port in the cylinder to provide for intake and another from the exhaust port to the exhaust pipe. The height of the port in relationship to the length of the cylinder is called the \\"port timing\\". On the first upstroke of the engine there would be no fuel inducted into the cylinder as the crankcase was empty. On the downstroke, the piston now compresses the fuel mix, which has lubricated the piston in the cylinder and the bearings due to the fuel mix having oil added to it. As the piston moves downward is first uncovers the exhaust, but on the first stroke there is no burnt fuel to exhaust. As the piston moves downward further, it uncovers the intake port which has a duct that runs to the crankcase. Since the fuel mix in the crankcase is under pressure, the mix moves through the duct and into the cylinder. Because there is no obstruction in the cylinder of the fuel to move directly out of the exhaust port prior to the piston rising far enough to close the port, early engines used a high domed piston to slow down the flow of fuel. Later the fuel was \\"resonated\\" back into the cylinder using an expansion chamber design. When the piston rose close to TDC, a spark ignites the fuel. As the piston is driven downward with power, it first uncovers the exhaust port where the burned fuel is expelled under high pressure and then the intake port where the process has been completed and will keep repeating. Later engines used a type of porting devised by the Deutz company to improve performance. It was called the Schnurle Reverse Flow system. DKW licensed this design for all their motorcycles. Their DKW RT 125 was one of the first motor vehicles to achieve over 100 mpg as a result.  Ignition  Internal combustion engines require ignition of the mixture, either by spark ignition (SI) or compression ignition (CI). Before the invention of reliable electrical methods, hot tube and flame methods were used. Experimental engines with laser ignition have been built. = Spark ignition process = Bosch magneto Points and coil ignition The spark ignition engine was a refinement of the early engines which used Hot Tube ignition. When Bosch developed the magneto it became the primary system for producing electricity to energize a spark plug. Many small engines still use magneto ignition. Small engines are started by hand cranking using a recoil starter or hand crank. Prior to Charles F. Kettering of Delco's development of the automotive starter all gasoline engined automobiles used a hand crank. Larger engines typically power their starting motors and ignition systems using the electrical energy stored in a lead–acid battery. The battery's charged state is maintained by an automotive alternator or (previously) a generator which uses engine power to create electrical energy storage. The battery supplies electrical power for starting when the engine has a starting motor system, and supplies electrical power when the engine is off. The battery also supplies electrical power during rare run conditions where the alternator cannot maintain more than 13.8 volts (for a common 12V automotive electrical system). As alternator voltage falls below 13.8 volts, the lead- acid storage battery increasingly picks up electrical load. During virtually all running conditions, including normal idle conditions, the alternator supplies primary electrical power. Some systems disable alternator field (rotor) power during wide open throttle conditions. Disabling the field reduces alternator pulley mechanical loading to nearly zero, maximizing crankshaft power. In this case, the battery supplies all primary electrical power. Gasoline engines take in a mixture of air and gasoline and compress it by the movement of the piston from bottom dead center to top dead center when the fuel is at maximum compression. The reduction in the size of the swept area of the cylinder and taking into account the volume of the combustion chamber is described by a ratio. Early engines had compression ratios of 6 to 1. As compression ratios were increased, the efficiency of the engine increased as well. With early induction and ignition systems the compression ratios had to be kept low. With advances in fuel technology and combustion management, high performance engines can run reliably at 12:1 ratio. With low octane fuel, a problem would occur as the compression ratio increased as the fuel was igniting due to the rise in temperature that resulted. Charles Kettering developed a lead additive which allowed higher compression ratios, which was progressively abandoned for automotive use from the 1970s onward, partly due to lead poisoning concerns. The fuel mixture is ignited at difference progressions of the piston in the cylinder. At low rpm, the spark is timed to occur close to the piston achieving top dead center. In order to produce more power, as rpm rises the spark is advanced sooner during piston movement. The spark occurs while the fuel is still being compressed progressively more as rpm rises. The necessary high voltage, typically 10,000 volts, is supplied by an induction coil or transformer. The induction coil is a fly-back system, using interruption of electrical primary system current through some type of synchronized interrupter. The interrupter can be either contact points or a power transistor. The problem with this type of ignition is that as RPM increases the availability of electrical energy decreases. This is especially a problem, since the amount of energy needed to ignite a more dense fuel mixture is higher. The result was often a high RPM misfire. Capacitor discharge ignition was developed. It produces a rising voltage that is sent to the spark plug. CD system voltages can reach 60,000 volts. CD ignitions use step-up transformers. The step-up transformer uses energy stored in a capacitance to generate electric spark. With either system, a mechanical or electrical control system provides a carefully timed high-voltage to the proper cylinder. This spark, via the spark plug, ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine's cylinders. While gasoline internal combustion engines are much easier to start in cold weather than diesel engines, they can still have cold weather starting problems under extreme conditions. For years, the solution was to park the car in heated areas. In some parts of the world, the oil was actually drained and heated over night and returned to the engine for cold starts. In the early 1950s, the gasoline Gasifier unit was developed, where, on cold weather starts, raw gasoline was diverted to the unit where part of the fuel was burned causing the other part to become a hot vapor sent directly to the intake valve manifold. This unit was quite popular until electric engine block heaters became standard on gasoline engines sold in cold climates. = Compression ignition process = Diesel, PPC and HCCI engines, rely solely on heat and pressure created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via a fuel injector that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines are more susceptible to cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. Light duty diesel engines with indirect injection in automobiles and light trucks employ glowplugs (or other pre-heating: see Cummins ISB#6BT) that pre-heat the combustion chamber just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a switch or mechanical apparatus), and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic engine control units (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.  Lubrication  Diagram of an engine using pressurized lubrication Surfaces in contact and relative motion to other surfaces require lubrication to reduce wear, noise and increase efficiency by reducing the power wasting in overcoming friction, or to make the mechanism work at all. Also, the lubricant used can reduce excess heat and provide additional cooling to components. At the very least, an engine requires lubrication in the following parts: * Between pistons and cylinders * Small bearings * Big end bearings * Main bearings * Valve gear (The following elements may not be present): ** Tappets ** Rocker arms ** Pushrods ** Timing chain or gears. Toothed belts do not require lubrication. In 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines, the interior of the crankcase, and therefore the crankshaft, connecting rod and bottom of the pistons are sprayed by the 2-stroke oil in the air-fuel-oil mixture which is then burned along with the fuel. The valve train may be contained in a compartment flooded with lubricant so that no oil pump is required. In a splash lubrication system no oil pump is used. Instead the crankshaft dips into the oil in the sump and due to its high speed, it splashes the crankshaft, connecting rods and bottom of the pistons. The connecting rod big end caps may have an attached scoop to enhance this effect. The valve train may also be sealed in a flooded compartment, or open to the crankshaft in a way that it receives splashed oil and allows it to drain back to the sump. Splash lubrication is common for small 4-stroke engines. In a forced (also called pressurized) lubrication system, lubrication is accomplished in a closed loop which carries motor oil to the surfaces serviced by the system and then returns the oil to a reservoir. The auxiliary equipment of an engine is typically not serviced by this loop; for instance, an alternator may use ball bearings sealed with their own lubricant. The reservoir for the oil is usually the sump, and when this is the case, it is called a wet sump system. When there is a different oil reservoir the crankcase still catches it, but it is continuously drained by a dedicated pump; this is called a dry sump system. On its bottom, the sump contains an oil intake covered by a mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver it to the big end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there to the bottom of the piston and from then to the cylinder. Other systems are also used to lubricate the cylinder and piston. The connecting rod may have a nozzle to throw an oil jet to the cylinder and bottom of the piston. That nozzle is in movement relative to the cylinder it lubricates, but always pointed towards it or the corresponding piston. Typically a forced lubrication systems have a lubricant flow higher than what is required to lubricate satisfactorily, in order to assist with cooling. Specifically, the lubricant system helps to move heat from the hot engine parts to the cooling liquid (in water-cooled engines) or fins (in air-cooled engines) which then transfer it to the environment. The lubricant must be designed to be chemically stable and maintain suitable viscosities within the temperature range it encounters in the engine.  Cylinder configuration  Common cylinder configurations include the straight or inline configuration, the more compact V configuration, and the wider but smoother flat or boxer configuration. Aircraft engines can also adopt a radial configuration, which allows more effective cooling. More unusual configurations such as the H, U, X, and W have also been used. thumbSome popular cylinder configurations: a – straight b – V c – opposed d – W Multiple cylinder engines have their valve train and crankshaft configured so that pistons are at different parts of their cycle. It is desirable to have the pistons' cycles uniformly spaced (this is called even firing) especially in forced induction engines; this reduces torque pulsations and makes inline engines with more than 3 cylinders statically balanced in its primary forces. However, some engine configurations require odd firing to achieve better balance than what is possible with even firing. For instance, a 4-stroke I2 engine has better balance when the angle between the crankpins is 180° because the pistons move in opposite directions and inertial forces partially cancel, but this gives an odd firing pattern where one cylinder fires 180° of crankshaft rotation after the other, then no cylinder fires for 540°. With an even firing pattern, the pistons would move in unison and the associated forces would add. Multiple crankshaft configurations do not necessarily need a cylinder head at all because they can instead have a piston at each end of the cylinder called an opposed piston design. Because fuel inlets and outlets are positioned at opposed ends of the cylinder, one can achieve uniflow scavenging, which, as in the four-stroke engine is efficient over a wide range of engine speeds. Thermal efficiency is improved because of a lack of cylinder heads. This design was used in the Junkers Jumo 205 diesel aircraft engine, using two crankshafts at either end of a single bank of cylinders, and most remarkably in the Napier Deltic diesel engines. These used three crankshafts to serve three banks of double-ended cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle with the crankshafts at the corners. It was also used in single-bank locomotive engines, and is still used in marine propulsion engines and marine auxiliary generators.  Diesel cycle  P-V diagram for the ideal Diesel cycle. The cycle follows the numbers 1–4 in clockwise direction. Most truck and automotive diesel engines use a cycle reminiscent of a four-stroke cycle, but with compression heating causing ignition, rather than needing a separate ignition system. This variation is called the diesel cycle. In the diesel cycle, diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinder so that combustion occurs at constant pressure, as the piston moves.  Otto cycle  Otto cycle is the typical cycle for most of the cars internal combustion engines, that work using gasoline as a fuel. Otto cycle is exactly the same one that was described for the four-stroke engine. It consists of the same major steps: Intake, compression, ignition, expansion and exhaust.  Five-stroke engine  In 1879, Nicolaus Otto manufactured and sold a double expansion engine (the double and triple expansion principles had ample usage in steam engines), with two small cylinders at both sides of a low-pressure larger cylinder, where a second expansion of exhaust stroke gas took place; the owner returned it, alleging poor performance. In 1906, the concept was incorporated in a car built by EHV (Eisenhuth Horseless Vehicle Company); and in the 21st century Ilmor designed and successfully tested a 5-stroke double expansion internal combustion engine, with high power output and low SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption).  Six-stroke engine  The six-stroke engine was invented in 1883. Four kinds of six-stroke use a regular piston in a regular cylinder (Griffin six-stroke, Bajulaz six-stroke, Velozeta six-stroke and Crower six-stroke), firing every three crankshaft revolutions. These systems capture the wasted heat of the four-stroke Otto cycle with an injection of air or water. The Beare Head and \\"piston charger\\" engines operate as opposed-piston engines, two pistons in a single cylinder, firing every two revolutions rather more like a regular four-stroke.  Other cycles  The very first internal combustion engines did not compress the mixture. The first part of the piston downstroke drew in a fuel-air mixture, then the inlet valve closed and, in the remainder of the down-stroke, the fuel-air mixture fired. The exhaust valve opened for the piston upstroke. These attempts at imitating the principle of a steam engine were very inefficient. There are a number of variations of these cycles, most notably the Atkinson and Miller cycles. The diesel cycle is somewhat different. Split-cycle engines separate the four strokes of intake, compression, combustion and exhaust into two separate but paired cylinders. The first cylinder is used for intake and compression. The compressed air is then transferred through a crossover passage from the compression cylinder into the second cylinder, where combustion and exhaust occur. A split-cycle engine is really an air compressor on one side with a combustion chamber on the other. Previous split-cycle engines have had two major problems—poor breathing (volumetric efficiency) and low thermal efficiency. However, new designs are being introduced that seek to address these problems. The Scuderi Engine addresses the breathing problem by reducing the clearance between the piston and the cylinder head through various turbo charging techniques. The Scuderi design requires the use of outwardly opening valves that enable the piston to move very close to the cylinder head without the interference of the valves. Scuderi addresses the low thermal efficiency via firing after top dead centre (ATDC). Firing ATDC can be accomplished by using high-pressure air in the transfer passage to create sonic flow and high turbulence in the power cylinder.  Combustion turbines   Jet engine  Turbofan jet engine Jet engines use a number of rows of fan blades to compress air which then enters a combustor where it is mixed with fuel (typically JP fuel) and then ignited. The burning of the fuel raises the temperature of the air which is then exhausted out of the engine creating thrust. A modern turbofan engine can operate at as high as 48% efficiency. There are six sections to a turbofan engine: * Fan * Compressor * Combustor * Turbine * Mixer * Nozzle  Gas turbines  Turbine power plant A gas turbine compresses air and uses it to turn a turbine. It is essentially a jet engine which directs its output to a shaft. There are three stages to a turbine: 1) air is drawn through a compressor where the temperature rises due to compression, 2) fuel is added in the combuster, and 3) hot air is exhausted through turbine blades which rotate a shaft connected to the compressor. A gas turbine is a rotary machine similar in principle to a steam turbine and it consists of three main components: a compressor, a combustion chamber, and a turbine. The air, after being compressed in the compressor, is heated by burning fuel in it. The heated air and the products of combustion expand in a turbine, producing work output. About of the work drives the compressor: the rest (about ) is available as useful work output. Gas Turbines are among the most efficient internal combustion engines. The General Electric 7HA and 9HA turbine combined cycle electrical plants are rated at over 61% efficiency.  Brayton cycle  Brayton cycle A gas turbine is a rotary machine somewhat similar in principle to a steam turbine. It consists of three main components: compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine. The air is compressed by the compressor where a temperature rise occurs. The compressed air is further heated by combustion of injected fuel in the combustion chamber which expands the air. This energy rotates the turbine which powers the compressor via a mechanical coupling. The hot gases are then exhausted to provide thrust. Gas turbine cycle engines employ a continuous combustion system where compression, combustion, and expansion occur simultaneously at different places in the engine—giving continuous power. Notably, the combustion takes place at constant pressure, rather than with the Otto cycle, constant volume.  Wankel engines  The Wankel rotary cycle. The shaft turns three times for each rotation of the rotor around the lobe and once for each orbital revolution around the eccentric shaft. The Wankel engine (rotary engine) does not have piston strokes. It operates with the same separation of phases as the four- stroke engine with the phases taking place in separate locations in the engine. In thermodynamic terms it follows the Otto engine cycle, so may be thought of as a \\"four-phase\\" engine. While it is true that three power strokes typically occur per rotor revolution, due to the 3:1 revolution ratio of the rotor to the eccentric shaft, only one power stroke per shaft revolution actually occurs. The drive (eccentric) shaft rotates once during every power stroke instead of twice (crankshaft), as in the Otto cycle, giving it a greater power-to-weight ratio than piston engines. This type of engine was most notably used in the Mazda RX-8, the earlier RX-7, and other vehicle models. The engine is also used in unmanned aerial vehicles, where the small size and weight and the high power-to-weight ratio are advantageous.  Forced induction  Forced induction is the process of delivering compressed air to the intake of an internal combustion engine. A forced induction engine uses a gas compressor to increase the pressure, temperature and density of the air. An engine without forced induction is considered a naturally aspirated engine. Forced induction is used in the automotive and aviation industry to increase engine power and efficiency. It particularly helps aviation engines, as they need to operate at high altitude. Forced induction is achieved by a supercharger, where the compressor is directly powered from the engine shaft or, in the turbocharger, from a turbine powered by the engine exhaust.  Fuels and oxidizers  All internal combustion engines depend on combustion of a chemical fuel, typically with oxygen from the air (though it is possible to inject nitrous oxide to do more of the same thing and gain a power boost). The combustion process typically results in the production of a great quantity of heat, as well as the production of steam and carbon dioxide and other chemicals at very high temperature; the temperature reached is determined by the chemical make up of the fuel and oxidisers (see stoichiometry), as well as by the compression and other factors.  Fuels  The most common modern fuels are made up of hydrocarbons and are derived mostly from fossil fuels (petroleum). Fossil fuels include diesel fuel, gasoline and petroleum gas, and the rarer use of propane. Except for the fuel delivery components, most internal combustion engines that are designed for gasoline use can run on natural gas or liquefied petroleum gases without major modifications. Large diesels can run with air mixed with gases and a pilot diesel fuel ignition injection. Liquid and gaseous biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel (a form of diesel fuel that is produced from crops that yield triglycerides such as soybean oil), can also be used. Engines with appropriate modifications can also run on hydrogen gas, wood gas, or charcoal gas, as well as from so-called producer gas made from other convenient biomass. Experiments have also been conducted using powdered solid fuels, such as the magnesium injection cycle. Presently, fuels used include: * Petroleum: ** Petroleum spirit (North American term: gasoline, British term: petrol) ** Petroleum diesel. ** Autogas (liquified petroleum gas). ** Compressed natural gas. ** Jet fuel (aviation fuel) ** Residual fuel * Coal: ** Gasoline can be made from carbon (coal) using the Fischer-Tropsch process ** Diesel fuel can be made from carbon using the Fischer-Tropsch process * Biofuels and vegetable oils: ** Peanut oil and other vegetable oils. ** Woodgas, from an onboard wood gasifier using solid wood as a fuel ** Biofuels: *** Biobutanol (replaces gasoline). *** Biodiesel (replaces petrodiesel). *** Dimethyl Ether (replaces petrodiesel). *** Bioethanol and Biomethanol (wood alcohol) and other biofuels (see Flexible- fuel vehicle). *** Biogas * Hydrogen (mainly spacecraft rocket engines) Even fluidized metal powders and explosives have seen some use. Engines that use gases for fuel are called gas engines and those that use liquid hydrocarbons are called oil engines; however, gasoline engines are also often colloquially referred to as, \\"gas engines\\" (\\"petrol engines\\" outside North America). The main limitations on fuels are that it must be easily transportable through the fuel system to the combustion chamber, and that the fuel releases sufficient energy in the form of heat upon combustion to make practical use of the engine. Diesel engines are generally heavier, noisier, and more powerful at lower speeds than gasoline engines. They are also more fuel-efficient in most circumstances and are used in heavy road vehicles, some automobiles (increasingly so for their increased fuel efficiency over gasoline engines), ships, railway locomotives, and light aircraft. Gasoline engines are used in most other road vehicles including most cars, motorcycles, and mopeds. Note that in Europe, sophisticated diesel-engined cars have taken over about 45% of the market since the 1990s. There are also engines that run on hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biodiesel, paraffin and tractor vaporizing oil (TVO). = Hydrogen = Hydrogen could eventually replace conventional fossil fuels in traditional internal combustion engines. Alternatively fuel cell technology may come to deliver its promise and the use of the internal combustion engines could even be phased out. Although there are multiple ways of producing free hydrogen, those methods require converting combustible molecules into hydrogen or consuming electric energy. Unless that electricity is produced from a renewable source—and is not required for other purposes—hydrogen does not solve any energy crisis. In many situations the disadvantage of hydrogen, relative to carbon fuels, is its storage. Liquid hydrogen has extremely low density (14 times lower than water) and requires extensive insulation—whilst gaseous hydrogen requires heavy tankage. Even when liquefied, hydrogen has a higher specific energy but the volumetric energetic storage is still roughly five times lower than gasoline. However, the energy density of hydrogen is considerably higher than that of electric batteries, making it a serious contender as an energy carrier to replace fossil fuels. The 'Hydrogen on Demand' process (see direct borohydride fuel cell) creates hydrogen as needed, but has other issues, such as the high price of the sodium borohydride that is the raw material.  Oxidizers  One-cylinder gasoline engine, Since air is plentiful at the surface of the earth, the oxidizer is typically atmospheric oxygen, which has the advantage of not being stored within the vehicle. This increases the power-to-weight and power-to-volume ratios. Other materials are used for special purposes, often to increase power output or to allow operation under water or in space. * Compressed air has been commonly used in torpedoes. * Compressed oxygen, as well as some compressed air, was used in the Japanese Type 93 torpedo. Some submarines carry pure oxygen. Rockets very often use liquid oxygen. * Nitromethane is added to some racing and model fuels to increase power and control combustion. * Nitrous oxide has been used—with extra gasoline—in tactical aircraft, and in specially equipped cars to allow short bursts of added power from engines that otherwise run on gasoline and air. It is also used in the Burt Rutan rocket spacecraft. * Hydrogen peroxide power was under development for German World War II submarines. It may have been used in some non-nuclear submarines, and was used on some rocket engines (notably the Black Arrow and the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighter). * Other chemicals such as chlorine or fluorine have been used experimentally, but have not been found practical.  Cooling  Cooling is required to remove excessive heat—over heating can cause engine failure, usually from wear (due to heat-induced failure of lubrication), cracking or warping. Two most common forms of engine cooling are air-cooled and water-cooled. Most modern automotive engines are both water and air- cooled, as the water/liquid-coolant is carried to air-cooled fins and/or fans, whereas larger engines may be singularly water-cooled as they are stationary and have a constant supply of water through water-mains or fresh-water, while most power tool engines and other small engines are air-cooled. Some engines (air or water-cooled) also have an oil cooler. In some engines, especially for turbine engine blade cooling and liquid rocket engine cooling, fuel is used as a coolant, as it is simultaneously preheated before injecting it into a combustion chamber.  Starting  Hand-cranking a boat diesel motor in Inle Lake (Myanmar). Electric starter as used in automobiles Internal combustion engines must have their cycles started. In reciprocating engines this is accomplished by turning the crankshaft (Wankel Rotor Shaft) which induces the cycles of intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust. The first engines were started with a turn of their flywheels, while the first vehicle (the Daimler Reitwagen) was started with a hand crank. All ICE engined automobiles were started with hand cranks until Charles Kettering developed the electric starter for automobiles. This method is now the most widely used, even among non-automobiles. As diesel engines have become larger and their mechanisms heavier, air starters have come into use. This is due to the lack of torque in electric starters. Air starters work by pumping compressed air into the cylinders of an engine to start it turning. Two-wheeled vehicles may have their engines started in one of four ways: * By pedaling, as on a bicycle * By pushing the vehicle and then engaging the clutch, known as \\"run-and-bump starting\\" * By kicking downward on a single pedal, known as \\"kick starting\\" * By an electric starter, as in cars There are also starters where a spring is compressed by a crank motion and then used to start an engine. Some small engines use a pull-rope mechanism called \\"recoil starting\\", as the rope rewinds itself after it has been pulled out to start the engine. This method is commonly used in pushed lawn mowers and other settings where only a small amount of torque is needed to turn an engine over. Turbine engines are frequently started by an electric motor or by compressed air.  Measures of engine performance  Engine types vary greatly in a number of different ways: * energy efficiency * fuel/propellant consumption (brake specific fuel consumption for shaft engines, thrust specific fuel consumption for jet engines) * power-to-weight ratio * thrust to weight ratio * torque curves (for shaft engines) thrust lapse (jet engines) * compression ratio for piston engines, overall pressure ratio for jet engines and gas turbines  Energy efficiency  Once ignited and burnt, the combustion products—hot gases—have more available thermal energy than the original compressed fuel-air mixture (which had higher chemical energy). The available energy is manifested as high temperature and pressure that can be translated into work by the engine. In a reciprocating engine, the high-pressure gases inside the cylinders drive the engine's pistons. Once the available energy has been removed, the remaining hot gases are vented (often by opening a valve or exposing the exhaust outlet) and this allows the piston to return to its previous position (top dead center, or TDC). The piston can then proceed to the next phase of its cycle, which varies between engines. Any heat that is not translated into work is normally considered a waste product and is removed from the engine either by an air or liquid cooling system. Internal combustion engines are heat engines, and as such their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency is determined by the difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the cylinder temperature rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the cylinder temperature nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto- ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak cylinder temperature. The thermodynamic limits assume that the engine is operating under ideal conditions: a frictionless world, ideal gases, perfect insulators, and operation for infinite time. Real world applications introduce complexities that reduce efficiency. For example, a real engine runs best at a specific load, termed its power band. The engine in a car cruising on a highway is usually operating significantly below its ideal load, because it is designed for the higher loads required for rapid acceleration. In addition, factors such as wind resistance reduce overall system efficiency. Engine fuel economy is measured in miles per gallon or in liters per 100 kilometres. The volume of hydrocarbon assumes a standard energy content. Most iron engines have a thermodynamic limit of 37%. Even when aided with turbochargers and stock efficiency aids, most engines retain an average efficiency of about 18–20%. However, the latest technologies in Formula One engines have seen a boost in thermal efficiency past 50%. There are many inventions aimed at increasing the efficiency of IC engines. In general, practical engines are always compromised by trade-offs between different properties such as efficiency, weight, power, heat, response, exhaust emissions, or noise. Sometimes economy also plays a role in not only the cost of manufacturing the engine itself, but also manufacturing and distributing the fuel. Increasing the engine's efficiency brings better fuel economy but only if the fuel cost per energy content is the same.  Measures of fuel efficiency and propellant efficiency  For stationary and shaft engines including propeller engines, fuel consumption is measured by calculating the brake specific fuel consumption, which measures the mass flow rate of fuel consumption divided by the power produced. For internal combustion engines in the form of jet engines, the power output varies drastically with airspeed and a less variable measure is used: thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), which is the mass of propellant needed to generate impulses that is measured in either pound force- hour or the grams of propellant needed to generate an impulse that measures one kilonewton-second. For rockets, TSFC can be used, but typically other equivalent measures are traditionally used, such as specific impulse and effective exhaust velocity.  Air and noise pollution   Air pollution  Internal combustion engines such as reciprocating internal combustion engines produce air pollution emissions, due to incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fuel. The main derivatives of the process are carbon dioxide , water and some soot—also called particulate matter (PM). The effects of inhaling particulate matter have been studied in humans and animals and include asthma, lung cancer, cardiovascular issues, and premature death. There are, however, some additional products of the combustion process that include nitrogen oxides and sulfur and some uncombusted hydrocarbons, depending on the operating conditions and the fuel-air ratio. Not all of the fuel is completely consumed by the combustion process. A small amount of fuel is present after combustion, and some of it reacts to form oxygenates, such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, or hydrocarbons not originally present in the input fuel mixture. Incomplete combustion usually results from insufficient oxygen to achieve the perfect stoichiometric ratio. The flame is \\"quenched\\" by the relatively cool cylinder walls, leaving behind unreacted fuel that is expelled with the exhaust. When running at lower speeds, quenching is commonly observed in diesel (compression ignition) engines that run on natural gas. Quenching reduces efficiency and increases knocking, sometimes causing the engine to stall. Incomplete combustion also leads to the production of carbon monoxide (CO). Further chemicals released are benzene and 1,3-butadiene that are also hazardous air pollutants. Increasing the amount of air in the engine reduces emissions of incomplete combustion products, but also promotes reaction between oxygen and nitrogen in the air to produce nitrogen oxides (). is hazardous to both plant and animal health, and leads to the production of ozone (O3). Ozone is not emitted directly; rather, it is a secondary air pollutant, produced in the atmosphere by the reaction of and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Ground-level ozone is harmful to human health and the environment. Though the same chemical substance, ground-level ozone should not be confused with stratospheric ozone, or the ozone layer, which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Carbon fuels contain sulfur and impurities that eventually produce sulfur monoxides (SO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the exhaust, which promotes acid rain. In the United States, nitrogen oxides, PM, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone, are regulated as criteria air pollutants under the Clean Air Act to levels where human health and welfare are protected. Other pollutants, such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene, are regulated as hazardous air pollutants whose emissions must be lowered as much as possible depending on technological and practical considerations. , carbon monoxide and other pollutants are frequently controlled via exhaust gas recirculation which returns some of the exhaust back into the engine intake, and catalytic converters, which convert exhaust chemicals to harmless chemicals. = Non-road engines = The emission standards used by many countries have special requirements for non-road engines which are used by equipment and vehicles that are not operated on the public roadways. The standards are separated from the road vehicles.  Noise pollution  Significant contributions to noise pollution are made by internal combustion engines. Automobile and truck traffic operating on highways and street systems produce noise, as do aircraft flights due to jet noise, particularly supersonic-capable aircraft. Rocket engines create the most intense noise.  Idling  Internal combustion engines continue to consume fuel and emit pollutants when idling so it is desirable to keep periods of idling to a minimum. Many bus companies now instruct drivers to switch off the engine when the bus is waiting at a terminal. In England, the Road Traffic Vehicle Emissions Fixed Penalty Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 1808) introduced the concept of a \\"stationary idling offence\\". This means that a driver can be ordered \\"by an authorised person ... upon production of evidence of his authorisation, require him to stop the running of the engine of that vehicle\\" and a \\"person who fails to comply ... shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale\\". Only a few local authorities have implemented the regulations, one of them being Oxford City Council. In many European countries, idling is, by default, disabled by stop-start systems.

Located near Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea and the Penn Station area, the building is a part of the Hudson Yards urban renewal project, a plan to redevelop the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's West Side Yard. Coach, Inc. is the anchor tenant. During planning, the tower was known as Tower C.  History   Construction  Hudson Yards, conceived through a large master plan by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, is expected to consist of 16 skyscrapers containing more than of new office, residential, and retail space. Among its components will be of commercial office space, a retail center with two levels of restaurants, cafes, markets and bars, a hotel, a cultural space, about 5,000 residences, a 750-seat school, and of public open space. 10 Hudson Yards, the first building on the site, is expected to help draw visitors to the area. March 2016 Groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards occurred on December 4, 2012, with a provisional completion date of 2016. Foundation work continued through the first half of 2013 and the superstructure work began on the tower in August 2013. During excavation work, of soil was removed and of concrete was poured.10 Hudson Yards Fact Sheet The contract to construct the tower was awarded to a subsidiary of Tutor Perini in March 2013. The tower is the first tower in the Hudson Yards complex to have been completed, because it is the only Hudson Yards tower not on the artificial platform over the West Side Yards. , 10 Hudson Yards had risen more than . , 10 Hudson Yards was 27 stories tall. , thirty-two of the tower's 52 floors had been completed. , 10 Hudson Yards had topped out. The tower was opened on May 31, 2016, with the first 300 Coach, Inc. employees moving into the building. The southern facade of 10 Hudson Yards cantilevers over the 30th Street spur of the High Line, and one of the building's entrances is to be located on the High Line. The architectural firm who designed 10 Hudson Yards was Kohn Pedersen Fox. In January 2019, the developers unveiled a long sculpture by American artist Jonathan Borofsky for the west lobby. Occupancy The first tenants were signed in April 2013. The building is anchored by Tapestry, Inc.'s global headquarters, which covers on floors 9 to 24 within the tower. The company purchased their space in a complex transaction with Related that involved purchasing space in the new building for over $750 million while simultaneously selling their nearby headquarters at 516 West 34th Street so that Related could erect portions of 50 Hudson Yards and the Hudson Park and Boulevard on the site. Coach's space includes a 15-story atrium, double height conference rooms overlooking the High Line, a private cafeteria, and a large terrace with views of the Hudson River. Coach was the first tenant to move into the new building on May 31, 2016. In September 2017, Coach subleased of space to The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. Building Entrance In total, the building was designed to accommodate over 7,000 employees. Additional occupants include L'Oreal USA, Boston Consulting Group, SAP, and Intersection occupying , and , and respectively. VaynerMedia occupies the building's 25th floor. There will also be retail space at street level adjacent to the retail building immediately to the north of 10 Hudson Yards. That building will be designed by Elkus Manfredi Architects. Fairway, a locally based grocer, was expected to build a store in the lower floors of the building, occupying . Additionally, Spanish chef José Andrés will operate a food hall named Mercado Little Spain which will contain a wine bar, a cocktail bar, and 15 kiosks serving different kinds of tapas. An outpost of fast casual salad restaurant Sweetgreen opened in August 2018 in the base of the tower. Ownership 10 Hudson Yards was initially owned by the master developers of the Hudson Yards project, Related Companies and Oxford Properties, in partnership with the Kuwait Investment Authority. Various sections of the tower were sold to tenants as office condos, with Coach purchasing their space for $750 million prior to construction. In August 2016, Coach sold their stake in the tower to Allianz for $420 million. The deal gave Allianz 44% ownership and valued the building at $2.15 billion. In May 2018, the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio purchased roughly 20% of the tower for $432 million at a similar valuation.

Kornblum was an American coroner who served as Los Angeles County Coroner from 1982 to 1990. Early life Kornblum was born December 5, 1933 in Chicago. He completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles and earned his medical degree at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1960 to 1961, Kornblum was a Navy medical officer in Saigon. Early career After Kornblum's naval service, he pursued his medical residency at Santa Clara County Hospital. Kornblum discovered that he enjoyed diagnosing illnesses more than treating them and decided to specialize in pathology. In 1966 he took a job with the Maryland Medical Examiner's office, where he rose to the position of chief deputy. There he presided over the autopsy of Yosef Alon. Ventura County In November 1973, Kornblum was named Ventura County's first full-time Chief Medical Examiner- Coroner after the county adopted a new system. He took office on January 1, 1974. Los Angeles County In 1980, Kornblum left Ventura County to become the top assistant to Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi. In 1982 Noguchi was demoted to physician specialist for speaking too freely to the media, moonlighting, and alleged mismanagement. Kornblum was appointed acting coroner. In 1987 he was appointed to the job outright after the Supreme Court of California declined to hear Noguchi's legal challenge of his demotion. Kornblum was praised for improving the office's efficiency and professionalism. He was also recognized for his knowledge of Sudden infant death syndrome, chokehold deaths, and fatalities involving Tasers. However Kornblum's office was also criticized for moving too slow on autopsies, leaving bodies at crime scenes for hours, and for bouncing corpses on freeways due to bad door locks on old coroner vehicles. Notable autopsies Kornblum performed include John Belushi, Natalie Wood, Truman Capote, William Holden, Karen Carpenter, Ron Settles, and Warren Oates. Outside of his capacity as coroner he testified in the Preppie Murder trial as an expert on chokehold deaths. In 1990, Kornblum resigned as Los Angeles County Coroner after an independent audit found that staff shortages and a high homicide rate were leading to unsanitary conditions, including dead insect larvae in the morgue and a body that had decomposed because it had been misplaced, and poor oversight of employees that had allowed for a double-billing scam to take place. Kornblum stated that he agreed with most of the 154 changes called for in the audit and had begun to implement some, but certain changes were impossible due to the \\"limited sized of the department's budget and the overwhelming workload\\". Death Kornblum died on September 23, 2008 at his home in La Cañada Flintridge, California.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Georgia voters chose 12 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Georgia was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Georgia had been 1 of just 6 states that voted against Reagan in 1980, but with Jimmy Carter not on the ballot, President Reagan cruised to victory in Georgia, even winning Sumter County where Carter's hometown, Plains is located. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Georgia, with just under 100% of the electorate voting either Democratic or Republican, and only those 2 parties appearing on the official ballot. The majority of counties in Georgia voted in majority for Reagan in a particularly strong turnout, even in this typically conservative- leaning state. A major exception to this trend was Atlanta's Fulton County, which voted mainly for Mondale, as did many counties in the center of the state. In Hancock County, Mondale received over 76% of the vote, which made it his fourth strongest county outside the District of Columbia. Georgia weighed in for this election as 2% more Republican than the national average. 1984 marked the first time a winning candidate won over a million votes in Georgia. , this is the last election in which Randolph County, Clarke County (home to Athens and the University of Georgia), and DeKalb County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois – his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for what he charged was his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide- spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Georgia with a resounding 21-point sweep-out landslide. While Georgia typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in Georgia are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Georgia, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Georgia and elsewhere. While Georgia backed its native son Jimmy Carter in the previous elections. The lack of Carter running along with Reagan's strong social conservative appeal made this state flip in large numbers. Additionally mirroring the previous trends, Reagan did very well the suburban counties which were receptive to his positions on reducing taxes and regulations.

Loeb in 1995. The firm operates as an employee-owned and SEC-registered investment advisor with approximately $17 billion in assets under management. As of December 2016, it has returned an average of 15.7% a year since inception. Third Point primarily invests in public equity, fixed income, and ADR markets globally and deploys an investment strategy that capitalizes on companies “undergoing events such as spinoffs or bankruptcies and pushes for corporate change\\". It also manages Third Point Reinsurance, a property and casualty reinsurer, and Third Point Offshore Investors, a UK-based closed-end investment company. Third Point's funds include: Third Point Partners, Third Point Opportunities Master Fund, Third Point Ultra Master Fund, and Third Point Resources. Third Point Ventures, its capital arm, invests in startup technology alternative energy and clean technology companies. Headquartered in New York City, the firm also has six additional offices: in Sunnyvale, California; Los Angeles, California; Stamford, Connecticut; Bangalore, India; Hong Kong; and London. Stakeholdings Massey Energy After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet. In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?” Acorda Therapeutics In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process \\"and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda were to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm it “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%. Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”. In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%. Yahoo = Board appointment = After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”. Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in- Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”. In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later. On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board. = Resignation from board = Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”. Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo \\"seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”. According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell \\"20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings\\", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would \\"bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board\\". Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018. Sotheby's Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%. Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”. Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet. Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”. Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's. Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.Sotheby shares rise on news of Ruprecht's tendered resignation, zacks.com; accessed January 4, 2015. Sony Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a \\"partial spinoff\\" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business\\", and even offered to \\"backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success\\". “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”. In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony's largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake. Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”. Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”. MGM The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM, leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul\\". Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”. Fanuc In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided \\"it would start talking to shareholders\\" and \\"return some of its cash to them.\\" Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to \\"shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards.\\" Ligand Pharmaceuticals After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million. Baxter International In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International. In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company's willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board. Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board. Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.” Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism. In December 2018, Third Point sold 22.2% of its stake in Baxter, dropping holdings to 28,008,125 shares. The sale was completed at a price of $68.62 per share. Nestlé In June 2017, Third Point disclosed its ownership in approximately 40 million shares of Nestlé, making it the company's sixth- largest shareholder according to Standard & Poor's Global Market Intelligence. Netflix In the fourth quarter of 2017, Third Point acquired 2 million shares or a .46 percent stake in Netflix, making it the ninth-largest equity long holding in the fund. Third Point funds Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P. Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund. According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch. A list of current investment holdings is available here. Third Point Re Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012. Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns. Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd. Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said. =2010 letter about Bernanke= In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the \\"narrative\\" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it. Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”. Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”. =Fairfax lawsuit= The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax- related positions” was the result of extensive research. New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.

It was originally settled as a German Catholic community. It is located in the northeastern part of Pasco County in Central Florida a few miles north of San Antonio and Saint Leo University. Saint Joseph also claims to be the \\"kumquat capital of the world\\" for its production of the citrus fruit. Because of this, nearby Dade City hosts the annual Kumquat Festival.http://www.dadecitychamber.org/Annual%20Kumquat%20Festival.cfm The community is also home to Sacred Heart Catholic Church, the third oldest parish in the Diocese of St. Petersburg.A CENTURY OF SERVICE St. Petersburg Times Oct 1, 1988; by Jeanne Pugh SACRED HEART CHURCH IS THE FOCUS OF AN ENDURING COMMUNITY IN PASCO History The area that became St. Joe was originally an unnamed satellite community of the Catholic colony of San Antonio, in what was then southern Hernando County. Judge Edmund F. Dunne was a legal counsel involved in the Disston Land Purchase of 1881, and as his commission, received 100,000 choice acres (400 km2) of land out of the 4,000,000 acre (16,000 km) purchase.http://www.fivay.org/san_antonio.html The following year, while surveying the Disston Purchase,Horgan, James J. (1990). Pioneer College: The Centennial History of Saint Leo College, Saint Leo Abbey, and Holy Name Priory. Saint Leo, FL. Saint Leo College Press. Judge Dunne selected the location for San Antonio, settling it as the center of a haven for Catholics in Florida. Most of the original colonists were of Irish and French lineage. Beginning in 1883 with Bernard A. Barthle, numerous German- immigrant families steadily moved to the greater colony. For the first few years the area was commonly known as Barthle Settlement and Barthle Crossing, after the pioneer family's adjoining homesteads. In 1888 the name St. Joseph, which was a homage to Barthle's first \\"American\\" hometown of St. Joseph, Minnesota, came into regular use. Judge Dunne mapped out, platted and established numerous villages surrounding San Antonio, including St. Thomas, Villa Maria, Carmel and San Felipe, but only St. Joseph survives today. In 1889 the Benedictines established the nearby monastery of St. Leo and St. Leo College on Dunne's former homestead and farm land, later incorporating the area as part of a separate town called St. Leo. The first Benedictine's arrival was a direct result of the colony's rapidly growing German-immigrant population, and their desire to have a German-speaking priest. Though the area for St. Leo was also platted by Dunne, it did not actually receive its name until after the arrival of the Benedictine monks.A short history of San Antonio On land donated by the Nathe family, St. Joseph School (later called St. Joe Elementary) operated beside Sacred Heart Church from September 1881 until it was closed in 1981 by the Pasco School Board. It was replaced by the much larger San Antonio Elementary about 2 miles away that same year. On October 15, 1984, and using the same buildings, Sacred Heart Early Childhood Center opened its doors with 7 children enrolled. Today, with greatly expanded and enhanced facilities, it serves over 150 children ranging from age 6 weeks to 12 years old,http://sacredheartecc.com/about/history/http://www.fivay.org/saint_joseph.html and is operated under the Diocese of St. Petersburg.

This is not to be confused with Libraries Without Borders, which has its headquarters in France, Belgium, Canada and Switzerland, or Bibliothécaires Sans Frontières, a now defunct French nonprofit. The organization is overseen by student committees at five Canadian Universities and a volunteer Executive Team and Board of Directors. Librarians Without Borders seeks to provide access to information in communities worldwide by creating partnerships with local people and local librarians. Librarians Without Borders engage in a number of outreach programs created to inspire a love of learning, community engagement and citizen scientists. Members are located in over 75 countries with the majority in Canada and the United States. History Librarians Without Borders (LWB) was founded by Melanie Sellar and Jorge Chimbinda at the University of Western Ontario's library school in London, Ontario in February 2005.Baird, Jansen & Liegbregts, 2007, p. 67–73 The organization was founded with the mission to \\"strive to improve access to information resources regardless of language, geography, or religion through the formation of partnerships with community organizations in developing regions.\\" The first project undertaken by LWB was in Huambo, Angola with the goal of building a sustainable library to house desperately needed nursing and medical information resources, among other resources to be added later.Baird, Jansen & Liegbregts 2007, p. 68-69. Projects Since its inception Librarians Without Borders has partnered with local community organizations, international non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, and other non-profit organizations to improve access to information in developing regions. Major projects have been undertaken in Angola, Ghana, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.  Angola  Librarians Without Borders' inaugural project focused on providing a medical and nursing collection for the Biblioteca Tutangi, a Portuguese-language library in Huambo, Angola. The library was acquired and renovated in early 2004 with the support of a local Catholic Mission. In addition to providing medical resources, LWB planned to partner with Angola library staff to provide collection development and maintenance support, information literacy instruction, and professional development. Unfortunately, due to complications related to legal issues surrounding the name of the organization brought forth by Doctors Without Borders and communication difficulties as a result of staff relocation, LWB decided to direct funds destined for the development of the collection to another African library by adopting an institution through the Canadian Organization for Development through Education (CODE).  Ghana  In 2011, Librarians Without Borders partnered with Librii—whose vision is to work with local communities to build low-cost networked libraries in the developing world—to develop a digitally powered library in Accra, Ghana.Heesen 2013, p. 35–37 While Librii would provided the \\"up-front costs for the facilities and provided content updates for the digital portal,\\" LWB would bring to the partnership the professional expertise and skills needed to establish and manage the library.Heesen 2013, p. 35 Since launching its Ghana project LWB has offered library science students and professional librarians the opportunity to work with Librii and its parent organization, Libraries Across Africa, to conduct research projects in library and information science.  Costa Rica  In 2010, LWB student committee members from the University of Western Ontario traveled to El Humo de Pejibaye in Costa Rica to build a school library and furnish it with books and other materials obtained through fundraising.Doi 2010, p. 221–222 The project was made possible through a partnership with La Asociación de Voluntariado, Investigación y Desarrollo Ambiental (VIDA: www.vida.org). In addition to constructing the library, students also \\"designed a basic cataloging method, processed the ISO-plus Spanish and English books purchased, created a card catalog, and prepared a library handbook for the school administrators.\\"Doi 2010, p. 221 Guatemala  In April 2010, students at the LWB Chapter at McGill University traveled to Quetzaltenango, Guatemala to establish a school library at the Asturias Academy, a combined preK-12 grade school of 250 students.Doi 2010, p. 222 The LWB Chapter students brought donations of books and school supplies, but their primary goal was to \\"address key aspects of library building and practices, including cataloguing, collection development, library space and layout, shelving recommendations, and programming ideas\\" Since 2010, LWB runs annual library service trips to Guatemala during April and May.

All fifty states and 50, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. South Carolina voters chose 8 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. South Carolina was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for South Carolina, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican. The majority of counties in South Carolina voted in majority for Reagan in a particularly strong turnout, even in this typically conservative-leaning state. South Carolina weighed in for this election as 5% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which Bamberg County voted for a Republican Presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in South Carolina with a resounding 28 point sweep-out landslide. While South Carolina typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in South Carolina are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in South Carolina, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in South Carolina and elsewhere.

He is recognised as the last master of the tabla tarang – a melodic percussion instrument consisting of numerous individually tuned hand drums, set in a semicircle. Maitra grew up in Calcutta and played the tabla until joining Uday Shankar's ballet company in 1950 and taking up the tabla tarang. He became the company's musical director and toured internationally with the troupe through to the mid 1970s. Along with Alla Rakha, Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia and others, Maitra was among the musicians that Ravi Shankar selected for his Music Festival from India revue in 1974. He then accompanied Shankar on ex-Beatle George Harrison's North American tour that year – a venture that led to him performing with American jazz musicians Emil Richards and Tom Scott. Maitra settled in Berlin in 1977, where he performed and worked as a music teacher. In 1980, he formed the Ragatala Ensemble, an orchestra that fused elements of Indian and European classical music with jazz and other Western genres. Among his recordings, Tabla Tarang – Melody on Drums (1996) has received critical acclaim, one reviewer describing it as a \\"milestone\\" in world music. Maitra developed strong cultural ties with Berlin and continued to live and work in Germany until his death in 2005. Background and formative years Kamalesh Maitra was born in Tangail in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in 1928. His father was an Ayurvedic doctor,Peter Pannke, \\"Ein Bengale in Berlin\\" (in German), Berliner Zeitung, 29 April 2005 (retrieved 29 November 2013). and the family lacked the musical lineage commonly associated with Hindustani classical music.\\"Kamalesh Maitra\\" > Bio, culturebase.net (retrieved 29 November 2013).Neuman, pp. 107, 108, 112. Maitra spent his formative years in Calcutta, absorbing much of the European influence on the city. At the age of twelve,World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 78. he began playing a variety of hand drums, including tabla. Early career In 1950, Maitra joined Uday Shankar's ballet and dance company, as master drummer. Having established himself as a tabla player, he was asked to master the tabla tarang,Gabriele Stiller-Kern, \\"Kamalesh Maitra: The last master of tabla taranga\\", culturebase.net (retrieved 29 November 2013). an instrument made up of between ten and sixteen tablas,Craig Harris, \\"Kamalesh Maitra\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 November 2013). specifically the treble-variety dayan.Lavezzoli, pp. 3, 24.Adam Greenberg, \\"Kamalesh Maitra Tabla Tarang – Melody on Drums\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 November 2013).

While developing the potential of the tabla tarang, he continued his advanced musical studies, learning the lute-like sarod under the tutelage of Ali Akbar Khan. From 1955, Maitra was musical director of Shankar's troupe, for whom he composed and directed music for a wide range of stage productions.Collaborations, p. 47. During a period of over twenty years, he toured the United States, China, Africa and Europe with the company. International career and relocation to Berlin In 1974, Uday's brother Ravi Shankar invited Maitra to join his Music Festival from India revue,Shankar, pp. 223–24. sponsored by former Beatle George Harrison,Madinger & Easter, p. 442. a champion of Indian classical music in the West.World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 109.Lavezzoli, pp. 14, 81, 147.

Long interested in the possibilities of Indo–European musical fusion, Maitra performed at the 1976 Meta-Music Festival in Berlin, in what was then West Germany. After moving to Berlin the following year, he began teaching Indian classical instrumentation, and in 1980 formed the Ragatala Ensemble with some of his students, including New York-born tablist Laura Patchen.\\"Laura Patchen\\", Global Music Academy (retrieved 24 April 2014). In 2003, Germany's House of World Cultures (HKW) website wrote of Maitra's music with the Ragatala Ensemble: \\"The group has enabled him to fulfil his old dream of having his compositions played by a mixed European–Indian orchestra. The pieces follow the rules of classical Indian music but are deliberately fused with elements of European classical music, jazz and new music.\\" Among his subsequent projects, from 1983 to 1988 Maitra participated in the Nada Brahma – the Whole World is Sound initiative by Joachim-Ernst Berendt; in 1992, as part of Berlin's Indian Festival, his orchestral works were performed at the HKW; and in 2000 he contributed to Festival of Vision – Berlin in Hong Kong. He worked again with Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Genesis (1986), recorded in Paris.Shankar, p. 247. In his 1997 autobiography, Raga Mala, Shankar describes Maitra as an \\"extremely versatile\\" musician, while the Boston Phoenix once said of his playing: \\"far from an eccentric novelty, (Maitra) is simply one of the great drummers of India to record in this century.\\" He also worked with Charlie Mariano, an American saxophonist who similarly relocated to Europe during the 1970s,Scott Yanow, \\"Charlie Mariano\\", AllMusic (retrieved 28 December 2013). and Israeli clarinetist Giora Feidman. Recordings Among Maitra's many recordings, starting with Tabla Tarang – Magnificent Percussion of India (1968) for HMV India, in 1993 he released Masters of Raga: Kamalesh Maitra on Germany's Wergo record label. The album features tabla accompaniment from Kumar Bose.Ken Hunt, \\"Kamalesh Maitra Masters of Raga\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 November 2013). The following year, the Gramophone Company of India issued The Voice of Sarod from the Strokes of Drums – Tabla Tarang by Kamalesh Maitra, on which he played three ragas accompanied by Rakha's son Fazal Qureshi on tabla and Laura Patchen on tambura.\\"Pandit Kamalesh Maitra tabla tarang – Catalog\\", University of Wisconsin–Madison Libraries (retrieved 29 November 2013). This was followed in 1996 by Tabla Tarang – Melody on Drums, issued in America by Smithsonian Folkways. The album features contributions from Indo–jazz percussionist Trilok Gurtu and Patchen again on tambura.

He continued to perform and record with the Ragatala Ensemble until 2003, the same year that he premiered his final orchestral work, Raag Symphonia, in Berlin. Maitra died on 22 April 2005, aged 76, in Kreischa, near the German city of Dresden. Hunt describes him as a \\"master musician\\" and attributes much of his musical vision to the pioneering spirit of Uday Shankar, who \\"painted the backdrops against which many trained musicians learned to deliver traditional music in a new age for people with no grounding or appreciation of traditional styles of dance or music\\". Maitra is commonly referred to as the \\"last master\\" of the comparatively rare tabla tarang.

He is best known for his work in forensic linguistics, which relates to investigating problems of the law by using the study of language. This includes analyzing legal material work such as notes, audio and video tape recordings, contracts, and confessions. Prior to his academic career, Leonard was a founding member of the rock band Sha Na Na and performed at Woodstock. Biography While he was working on his undergraduate degree at Columbia University, Leonard and his brother George became members of the school's a cappella group. In 1969, the doo-wop band Sha Na Na was born when George suggested changing the style of the group to a faux Brooklyn thug style, with slicked back hair, and white shirts. Leonard, who was the bass singer of the band, sang the lead on “Teen Angel” when the band opened for their friend Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. Leonard was listed by TIME magazine as one of the top ten smartest musicians. Leonard spent two years with the band, until he stopped at the age of twenty-one. He left the band because he was offered a fellowship at Columbia University Graduate School and wanted to further his education in linguistics .  Education and qualifications  Leonard began his education at Columbia College, receiving his BA and graduating in 1970 cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in sociology. He then moved on to the Columbia Graduate School as a faculty fellow, receiving his MA and MPhil in linguistics in 1973, and his PhD in linguistics in 1982. While receiving his PhD at Columbia, he was trained by William Diver, founder of the Columbia School of Linguistics, and William Labov, founder of variationist sociolinguistics. During a Fulbright Fellowship tenure which lasted from 1974-1975, Leonard studied at the University of Nairobi in Kenya. He held a position as a research associate at the Institute of African Studies. His other training includes Advanced Linguistics Training at the Linguistic Society Institute, and Leonard studied at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the summer of 1973 and the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, in the summer of 1977. Leonard also studied the Thai language at the American University Alumni Association in Bangkok, Thailand, during the summer of 1976. Leonard is qualified as an expert witness in linguistics in twelve states, and six Federal district courts (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and in U.S. district courts in Newark, New Jersey, Austin, Texas, New York, New York, San Jose, California, Tampa, Florida, and Denver, Colorado, and has also testified before World Bank ICSID tribunals in Washington, DC, and Paris. In addition, he knows how to speak and read several varieties of Swahili, as well as French and Spanish. He knows how to read Italian, and has structural knowledge of Giriama, Kamba, Rabai, Pokomo (Kenya); Shona (Zimbabwe); Thai, and Arabic.  Career  Leonard has assisted in solving many cases. Examples include: * The murder of JonBenet Ramsay: Leonard testified that the ransom note had not been written by John Mark Karr, who falsely confessed to the murder.http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13062193 * The murder of Charlene Hummert: Leonard testified that the writing of Charlene's husband Brian Hummert matched the letters supposedly sent by a stalker to Charlene Hummert. Leonard's explanation was partially based on the contraction patterns of positive and negative statements. Brian Hummert was guilty of the murder. * The Tennessee Facebook murders: Leonard testified that a supposed CIA agent named \\"Chris\\", who presumably accepted the murders as a CIA hit, wrote a series of Facebook messages that were consistent with the writing patterns of the two suspects, Jenelle and Barbara Potter. Leonard's analysis explained partially the use of the peculiar placement of quotation marks; in this case, the beginning of the sentence contained a single quote, but the end contained a double quote. Both Jenelle and Barbara Potter were complicit in the murders.https://abcnews.go.com/US/social-media-feud-led- murder-young-tennessee-couple/story?id=34346840 * Featured on many TV shows such as Forensic Files; A Tight Leash, Uncovering the Truth (Byron Case and Michael Politte exoneration cases on MTV); and Too Pretty to Live: The Catfishing Murders of East Tennessee on Investigation Discovery. * Presented \\"The Groundbreaking Science of Forensic Linguistics\\" at the Polyglot Conference in 2015. Leonard founded and directs the graduate program in forensic linguistics at Hofstra University, where he is professor of linguistics. He previously taught at Columbia. The New Yorker wrote that Leonard “has emerged as one of the foremost language detectives in the country,” and jocularly termed him “a Sam Spade of semantics.” Newsday characterized him as “Professor Henry Higgins meets Sherlock Holmes.” Leonard's forensic linguistic consulting clients have included the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force, the FBI, Federal Public Defenders offices, and the Prime Minister of Canada. The Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI recruited Leonard to train agents in forensic linguistic analysis at Quantico, and he has trained British law enforcement units in London. He was Apple's linguist in its civil trademark cases against both Microsoft and Amazon.\\"Order denying motion for preliminary injunction.\\" Salon pointed out that Leonard came from quite a different former career path and noted Leonard’s quip, \\"I like to say I'm one of the very few people in the world who have worked with the FBI and the Grateful Dead.\\" (He trained FBI agents in how to analyze language for clues in solving crimes and previously helped to found and sang with Sha Na Na that had opened for groups such as Grateful Dead.)

The Party set its agenda taking into account developments since its last convention, including the recent convention of the AFL-CIO, the 2012 election, and the Occupy movement, as well as re-examining the Party's organizational structure.  Pre-convention  The National Committee of the Communist Party USA met on 16–17 November 2013 in New York City to assess the political development, project actions and adopt plans for the 30th National Convention and the discussion period preceding it. Chairman Sam Webb opened the meeting with an assessment of the recent government shutdown and its aftermath, the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the 2013 election results, new developments in organized labor, the Democratic Party and neo-liberalism, climate change, and the struggle against racism. While no resolutions were made, subjects of discussion included incorporating \\"Socialism of the 21st Century\\" into the party platform, as well as changes to terminology, including officially dropping Marxism–Leninism from the party constitution. The Chicago convention was to have 3 days of official Communist Party USA activities; increased online activity was expected. The Communist Party USA had to deal with issues of supporting the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, for example, which hurt the party's credibility.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Virginia voters chose 12 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Virginia was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Virginia, with just under 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, and only three candidates appearing on the ballot. The majority of counties in Virginia voted for the Republican candidate in a particularly strong turn out, in what was at the time a typically conservative-leaning state. Mondale did gain majorities in largely African-American counties in the east, highly unionized coal counties in southwest Virginia, and the independent cities of Alexandria, Norfolk, and Richmond.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/47846/ Virginia weighed in for this election as 5% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which the independent cities of Franklin, Roanoke, and Falls Church voted for the Republican candidate. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice- President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination from the party in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan (center, far left frame) attends the interment ceremony for the Vietnam Era serviceman, at the Tomb of the Unknowns, Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. May 28, 1984. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970s, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Virginia with a resounding 25 point sweep-out landslide. While Virginia typically voted conservative at the time, the election results in Virginia are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Virginia, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in Virginia and elsewhere.

He is an assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State University, and his areas of academic focus include atheism, critical thinking, pedagogy, scientific skepticism, and the Socratic method. He is the author of A Manual for Creating Atheists and How to Have Impossible Conversations: A Very Practical Guide. Boghossian was involved in the Grievance Studies affair (also called \\"Sokal Squared\\" in media coverage) with collaborators James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, in which they published several hoax papers in academic journals, as part of their criticism of a set of fields including gender studies. As a result, Portland State University initiated a research misconduct investigation of him in 2018. Boghossian coined the term Street Epistemology for a set of conversational techniques he described which are designed to enable examination of strongly held beliefs, especially of the religious kind, in a non-confrontation manner. Career Boghossian's primary interests are critical thinking, philosophy of education, and moral reasoning. Boghossian's thesis looks at the use of the Socratic method with prison inmates for critical thinking and moral reasoning with the intention to decrease ongoing criminal behavior. The research was funded by the State of Oregon. Boghossian was Chairman of the Prison Advisory Committee for the Columbia River Correctional Institution and he is currently a fellow at the Center for Prison Reform. Boghossian is employed as an assistant professor at Portland State University. Boghossian is the author of two books, A Manual for Creating Atheists, a book with a foreword by Michael Shermer, and How to Have Impossible Conversations: A Very Practical Guide. He also contributed a foreword to Stefan Molyneux's book Against the Gods. As part of his ongoing interest in Prison Reform, Portland State University entered into a partnership with the Columbia River Correctional Institution in 2009 to address the needs of inmates releasing into the community. Details of this partnership have been elaborated in an article titled Prisons, Community Partnerships, and Academia: Sustainable Programs and Community Need. Along with Michael Shermer and Jennifer Whitson, Boghossian was featured as an expert in the 2017 documentary Reasons To Believe, which explores the psychology and science of belief. Boghossian has been a speaker for the Center for Inquiry, the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, and the Secular Student Alliance. He has been nominated as a member of the Global Secular Council.Secular Global Institute: \\"Peter Boghossian\\" . Views Boghossian has called all faith-based beliefs \\"delusions.\\" He has been described by The Daily Beast as aligned with the New Atheist movement. He advocates using the Socratic method to dissuade religious believers, though he recommends focusing on the problems of faith as a way of knowing (he calls it an \\"unreliable epistemology\\"), rather than the outward trappings of religious communities. In a 2015 interview with Dave Rubin, Boghossian described himself as a classical liberal who has never voted for a Republican candidate, but is \\"not a fan\\" of the Democrats. He stated that any of the Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election \\"would be an unmitigated disaster.\\" He donated to and endorsed Andrew Yang for the 2020 United States presidential election. According to Boghossian, \\"the regressive left have taken over academia.\\" He has repeatedly stated that cultural relativism and egalitarianism are contradictory values. Grievance studies affair The grievance studies affair, also referred to as the \\"Sokal Squared\\" scandal by the news media, consisted of the submission of hoax academic papers for peer- review, performed by Boghossian, James A. Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose on a series of academic fields which they termed “grievance studies”, a sub- category of race, gender, feminist and sexuality studies which they believed were characterized by low scientific standards. Previous hoax paper In 2017, Boghossian and Lindsay published a hoax paper titled \\"The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct\\". The paper, which the authors said was intentionally absurd and written in a way that imitated the style of \\"poststructuralist discursive gender theory\\", argued that the penis should be seen \\"not as an anatomical organ but as a social construct isomorphic to performative toxic masculinity.\\" Boghossian and Lindsay initially submitted the paper to Norma, where it was rejected. They later submitted the paper to Cogent Social Sciences, an open access journal which has been criticized as a pay-to-publish operation. The authors later revealed the hoax in Skeptic magazine. Boghossian and Lindsay stated that they intended to demonstrate that \\"gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding almost-religious belief that maleness is the root of all evil\\", and also to highlight problems with the review processes of open-access journals. A number of critics questioned whether Boghossian and Lindsay's paper demonstrated a problem in the field of gender studies. Alan Sokal, a mathematics professor who was responsible for a similar hoax in 1996, noted that Cogent Social Sciences was a low-tiered open access journal that did not specialize in gender studies, and said that it seemed unlikely the paper would have been accepted at a mainstream gender studies journal. While the journal did conduct a postmortem, Boghossian and Lindsay concluded the \\"impact [of the hoax] was very limited, and much criticism of it was legitimate.\\" Sequence of events Beginning in August 2017, Boghossian, Lindsay, and Pluckrose began a much larger attempt in which they wrote 20 hoax papers, submitting them to peer-reviewed journals under a variety of pseudonyms as well as the name of Richard Baldwin, a professor emeritus at Florida’s Gulf Coast State College and friend of Boghossian. The project was halted early after one of the papers in the feminist geography journal Gender, Place and Culture was criticized on social media, and then its authenticity questioned on Campus Reform. After this, the trio revealed the full extent of their work in a YouTube video created and released by documentary filmmaker Mike Nayna, alongside an investigation by The Wall Street Journal.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVk9a5Jcd1k By the time of the revelation seven of their twenty papers had been accepted, seven were still under review, and six had been rejected. One paper, which was accepted by feminist social work journal Affilia, transposed up-to-date jargon into passages lifted from Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf. Tom Whipple of The Times wrote that academic reviewers had praised the studies prior to the revelation of the hoax as \\"a rich and exciting contribution to the study of ... the intersection between masculinity and anality\\", \\"excellent and very timely\\", and \\"important dialogue for social workers and feminist scholars\\". Reactions The project drew both praise and criticism, with author and Harvard lecturer Yascha Mounk dubbing it 'Sokal squared' in reference to the famous Sokal Affair hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal and saying \\"The result is hilarious and delightful. It also showcases a serious problem with big parts of academia.\\" Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker said the project posed the question \\"is there any idea so outlandish that it won’t be published in a Critical/PoMo/Identity/‘Theory’ journal?\\" Daniel Engber of online magazine Slate criticised the project, saying \\"one could have run this sting on almost any empirical discipline and returned the same result.\\" In an open letter, eleven of Boghossian's colleagues at Portland State University wrote that the hoaxes \\"violat[ed] acceptable norms of research,\\" and were \\"fraudulent, time- wasting, anti-intellectual activities.\\" Joel P. Christensen and Matthew A. Sears said it was \\"the academic equivalent of the fraudulent hit pieces on Planned Parenthood\\" produced in 2015. Carl Bergstrom claimed \\"the hoaxers appear woefully naïve about how the [peer review] system actually works.\\" Research misconduct investigation In 2018, Boghossian's employer, Portland State University, initiated a research misconduct inquiry relating to the grievance studies affair. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the university's institutional review board (IRB) concluded that Boghossian violated the ethical guidelines by conducting research on human subjects without approval. The University also said it is \\"considering a further charge that he had falsified data.\\" After news of the research conduct investigation broke, a number of prominent academics wrote letters defending Boghossian, including evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, mathematician and physicist Alan Sokal, philosopher Daniel Dennett, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, and psychologist Jordan Peterson. Pinker wrote that Portland State University's investigation struck him and his colleagues \\"as an attempt to weaponize an important [principle] of academic ethics in order to punish a scholar for expressing an unpopular opinion.\\" Dawkins suggested that the investigation could be politically motivated: \\"If the members of your committee of inquiry object to the very idea of satire as a form of creative expression, they should come out honestly and say so. But to pretend that this is a matter of publishing false data is so obviously ridiculous that one cannot help suspecting an ulterior motive.\\" Peterson said that those pursuing allegations against Boghossian, and not Boghossian himself, were guilty of academic misconduct. On the other hand, IRB experts interviewed by Jesse Singal for New York magazine agreed that Boghossian should have sought IRB approval for the study. In December 2018, Portland State University ruled that Boghossian had \\"violated ethical guidelines on human-subjects research\\". Consequently, he was banned from doing research until he had \\"completed training and could demonstrate that he understood how to protect the rights of human subjects.”Mangan, Katherine (July 24, 2019) \\"Portland State Says Researcher Violated the Rights of the Editors He Duped\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved September 11, 2020.  Street Epistemology  Street Epistemology (often abbreviated to SE) is a term coined by Boghossian in his book A Manual for Creating Atheists. This is a set of non-confrontation conversational techniques concerning a strongly held belief, designed to promote thoughtful reflection and open-mindedness in a participant regarding the belief. Boghossian outlined the method and its application in helping religious believers to reflect on the reliability of faith as an epistemology. However, it has also found effective use in many other contexts, and Boghossian later co-authored How to Have Impossible Conversations with James Lindsay, which describes the application of Street Epistemology to an examination of a wider range of beliefs. SE was popularized by Anthony Magnabosco who has uploaded many examples of SE conversations he has had to a YouTube channel, created many resources surrounding the topic, and engages with a community of Street Epistemologists looking to become proficient in the method and apply it in their lives. Magnabosco is the founder of Street Epistemology International, a non-profit organization \\"whose mission is to encourage and normalize critical thinking and skepticism while providing people around the world with the resources needed to develop and promote Street Epistemology.\\" Resources are available for the community of SE practitioners, which include a guide on how to perform interviews using the style.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. West Virginia voters chose 6 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. West Virginia was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with incumbent Vice President and former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for West Virginia, with over 99% of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or Republican parties, and only five parties appearing on the ballot. Most counties turned out for Reagan except for a bloc of heavily unionized, coal- dependent counties in the southern part of the state bordering Virginia and Kentucky. West Virginia weighed in for this election as 4% more Democratic than the national average. Democratic platform Walter Mondale accepted the Democratic nomination for presidency after pulling narrowly ahead of Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Rev. Jesse Jackson of Illinois - his main contenders during what would be a very contentiousKurt Andersen, \\"A Wild Ride to the End\\", Time, May 28, 1984 Democratic primary. During the campaign, Mondale was vocal about reduction of government spending, and, in particular, was vocal against heightened military spending on the nuclear arms race against the Soviet Union,Trying to Win the Peace, by Even Thomas, Time, July 2, 1984 which was reaching its peak on both sides in the early 1980s. Taking a (what was becoming the traditional liberal) stance on the social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, the right to choose regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools. He also criticized Reagan for his economic marginalization of the poor, stating that Reagan's reelection campaign was \\"a happy talk campaign,\\" not focused on the real issues at hand.Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics A very significant political move during this election: the Democratic Party nominated Representative Geraldine Ferraro to run with Mondale as Vice-President. Ferraro is the first female candidate to receive such a nomination in United States history. She said in an interview at the 1984 Democratic National Convention that this action \\"opened a door which will never be closed again,\\" speaking to the role of women in politics. Republican platform Reagan challenging Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall!,\\" from the Brandenburg Gate in June, 1987. Reagan's firm stance with the Soviet Union was an important contributor to his 1984 reelection. By 1984, Reagan was very popular with voters across the nation as the President who saw them out of the economic stagflation of the early and middle 1970's, and into a period of (relative) economic stability. The economic success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep tax cuts for the wealthy, and the second was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending,Historical tables, Budget of the United States Government , 2013, table 6.1. the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called \\"Reaganomics\\", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987. These new tax policies also arguably curbed several existing tax loopholes, preferences, and exceptions, but Reaganomics is typically remembered for its trickle down effect of taxing poor Americans more than rich ones as a percentage of an individual's total income. Reaganomics has (along with legislation passed under presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton) been criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession. Virtually unopposed during the Republican primaries, Reagan ran on a campaign of furthering his economic policies. Reagan vowed to continue his \\"war on drugs,\\" passing sweeping legislation after the 1984 election in support of mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. Furthermore, taking a (what was becoming the traditional conservative) stance on the social issues of the day, Reagan strongly opposed legislation regarding comprehension of gay marriage, abortion, and (to a lesser extent) environmentalism, regarding the final as simply being bad for business. Republican victory Reagan won the election in West Virginia with a decisive 11 point landslide. While West Virginia typically voted Democratic at the time, the election results in the state are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 election. West Virginia would not vote Republican again in a presidential election until 2000. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\" Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in West Virginia, and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, in West Virginia and elsewhere.

She is believed to be an influence for the fairy tale of Snow White. Life According to Bad Wildungen city documents she was famous for her beauty.Dekker, p. 33 Since 1539 she had a very strict stepmother, Katharina von Hatzfeldt (1510–1546) and perhaps soon after Margaretha was raised at Weilburg at the court of Philip III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1545 she traveled through the Siebengebirge (\\"seven hills\\") to live with her mother's brother Johann Cirksena (1506-1572) at Valkenburg Castle, in present-day Limburg, Netherlands.Dekker, pp. 31-32 In 1549, her father sent her on to the Brussels court of Mary of Hungary, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Margaretha's presence at the court was partially meant to improve the relationship of her father with the emperor and help the release of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who had been imprisoned in Brussels for his role in the Schmalkaldic War. The situation at the court was complicated as several high ranking personalities were striving for Margaretha, including Lamoral, Count of Egmont. Charles V's son, Crown Prince Philip, arrived at his aunt's court in 1549. Tradition has it that he pursued Margaretha during the few months he was there, though there never could be any official relationship, as she was Lutheran.Dekker, p. 35 Three surviving letters from Margaretha to her father show that her health declined steadily over the next few years and she died at the age of 21 in March 1554.Dekker, p. 40 In Waldeck chronicles it was suggested that she had been poisoned. Snow White inspiration Eckhard Sander, in his book Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? (Snow White: Is It a Fairy Tale?), alleged that Margaretha's life was inspiration for the tale of Snow White. Since, however, her father's second wife died in 1546 and he only remarried again in October 1554, her stepmother was not a suspect in the alleged poisoning case. Margaretha's father owned several copper mines; a majority of workers were children, and the legendary reference to the seven dwarfs is suggested to be related to child labor in the mine. The residence of the seven dwarfs has been suggested to be the former copper mining village Bergfreiheit, now a district of Bad Wildungen that calls itself Schneewittchendorf (Snow White village). Like the fairy tale's dwarfs, the child laborers there used to live in groups of about 20 in a single room house.

It was first released on November 23, 2013, in the United States and stars Najarra Townsend as a young woman that finds herself suffering from a mysterious sexually transmitted disease after a rape. It has been compared to the 2012 film Thanatomorphose, with which it shares similarities. Twitch Film has criticized the movie for its marketing, in which England describes the character Samantha's rape as a \\"one night stand\\".  Plot  In a morgue, a man with an Abaddon tattoo has sex with a corpse that has a biohazard symbol on the toe tag; afterward, he handles an empty test tube while washing up. Samantha is trying to get over a recent break-up with her girlfriend, Nikki. The party's host, Alice, plies her with strong drinks, while Zain offers her drugs. After she becomes heavily inebriated, Samantha is approached by BJ, who offers her a drink. Even though she tells him that she is a lesbian, when she begins to black out, BJ takes her to his car and rapes her. The next morning, Samantha thinks she is suffering from a bad hangover. She bickers with her mother, who struggles to accept her daughter's lesbianism and is worried that she might have relapsed into hard drug use. Alice tells Samantha that the police are searching for BJ, who Alice had never met. At the restaurant where she works, Samantha has trouble eating and is overly sensitive to noise. When she bleeds heavily from her vagina, she visits her doctor. Despite her protests that she is a lesbian who has not had sex with men for nearly a year, he is suspicious that she has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from heterosexual intercourse because of a rash that has developed in her groin. Samantha tries to repair her relationship with Nikki, who is rude to her. Samantha is hurt to learn that Nikki had not let her know that a scholarship offer had come in the mail. Meanwhile, her symptoms continue to worsen. Her eyes turn bloodshot, and her hair falls out in clumps. When she is called into the restaurant on a short-notice shift her fingernails begin to fall off. Samantha flees the restaurant and returns to her doctor, who advises her to avoid contact with other people until tests can determine the nature of her disease. Instead, Samantha visits Zain, who gives her heroin. When Alice arrives, she encourages Samantha to talk to the police about her encounter with BJ. Believing that Alice wants to isolate her from her other friends, Samantha argues with her and storms off. Zain reveals to Alice that he sold Rohypnol to BJ at the party. Samantha stops off at home and argues violently with her mother. She abruptly leaves for her flower competition but is turned away at the door because of her appearance and the condition of her flowered plant. Samantha turns to Nikki for consolation, but Nikki coldly rejects her and calls her sexually confused. Enraged, Samantha chokes Nikki to death. She then drives to Alice's in a rage and murders her by biting out her throat. Losing her sanity, Samantha invites Riley, a man who has had a crush on her, to Alice's house and tries to seduce him. Riley sees maggots fall out of Samantha's vagina and becomes repulsed. When he goes to the bathroom to inspect himself, he discovers Alice's body. Samantha flees the house. As she drives, she fades out of consciousness and is involved in a car crash. She emerges from the wreckage transformed fully into a zombie. Her mother, who has arrived at the scene, begs the police not to shoot Samantha. As the police caution Samantha against moving, she lunges at her screaming mother.  Cast  * Najarra Townsend as Samantha Williams * Caroline Williams as Nancy Williams * Alice Macdonald as Alice Patrick * Katie Stegeman as Nikki * Matt Mercer as Riley McCormick * Charley Koontz as Zain * Simon Barrett as Brent \\"BJ\\" Jaffe * Ruben Pla as Doctor * Dave Holmes as Therapist  Production  England said that he began working on Contracted due to his wanting to \\"tell a story within the virus/infection subgenre like we've never seen before\\" and that he wanted to use sex as a plot device as it was something that \\"most people can understand and relate to\\". He wrote the film's script in March 2012 and shot Contracted during a 15-day period in Los Angeles in May of the same year. Casting for the film was difficult due to the limited funds, as well as some actors finding the film's content \\"too bold\\" or having scheduling conflicts. Veteran horror actress Caroline Williams was cast as the mother of the main character after England and film producer Matt Mercer approached her via her Facebook page. England had initially planned to have the film center around the film's protagonist experiencing the loss of her virginity, but changed it to focus on a character that is uncertain of her sexuality and has a prior lifestyle different than the one she currently has. He had also initially planned to have the film set outside of the United States and focus slightly on xenophobia, but did not have the budget to accommodate this and as such, changed the movie's setting to Los Angeles.  Release  Contracted at Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival on July 7, 2013. IFC Films released it in the United States in theaters and video on demand on November 22, 2013, and on DVD on March 18, 2014.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 53% of 16 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.8/10. Metacritic rated it 48/100 based on 5 reviews. Rob Staeger of The Village Voice wrote the film moves from moralizing to under-explored themes while remaining full of stereotypical characters. Fangoria compared Contracted to the similarly plotted Thanatomorphose, saying that while both had a similar premise, Contracteds \\"visual palette is relatively conventional\\" in comparison. In a mixed review, Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that the \\"ending to this fable misses the opportunity for broader metaphorical resonance, but getting there has its own unnerving rewards\\". In contrast, Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times stated that while the film was \\"absurd\\" it was also \\"compelling\\" and that it would play well off of the unrelated 2013 film Blue Is the Warmest Colour. Staci Layne Wilson of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote the film is neither body horror nor a zombie film but simply a gross-out film. Dennis Harvey of Variety called it \\"a body horror opus\\" whose vague themes and unlikeable characters are not readily discernible as intentional. Ben Croll of Twitch Film criticized the film's marketing, which depicts a one-night stand that is opposed by an unambiguous depiction of rape in the film.

All 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, were part of the 1984 United States presidential election. Voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president of the United States. Connecticut was won by incumbent United States President Ronald Reagan of California, who was running against former Vice President Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Reagan ran for a second time with former C.I.A. Director George H. W. Bush of Texas, and Mondale ran with Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York, the first major female candidate for the vice presidency. Partisan background The presidential election of 1984 was a very partisan election for Connecticut, with over 99% of the electorate voting only either Democratic or Republican, and only 4 parties appearing on the ballot. Every county in Connecticut voted in majority for the Republican candidate. Connecticut weighed in for this election as 2% more Republican than the national average. , this is the last election in which Hartford County voted for the Republican candidate. This is also the final time that a Republican presidential candidate was able to win every county in the state. Republican victory Reagan won the election in Connecticut with a resounding 22 point sweep-out landslide. Typically a liberal-leaning state, the election results in Connecticut are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the \\"second American Revolution.\\" This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the Atlantic Northeast, at large, as Reagan did. It is speculated that Mondale lost support with voters nearly immediately during the campaign, namely during his acceptance speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. There he stated that he intended to increase taxes. To quote Mondale, \\"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\\"Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984, AllPolitics Despite this claimed attempt at establishing truthfulness with the electorate, this promise to raise taxes badly eroded his chances in what had already begun as an uphill battle against the charismatic Ronald Reagan. Reagan also enjoyed high levels of bipartisan support during the 1984 presidential election, both in Connecticut and across the nation at large. Many registered Democrats who voted for Reagan (Reagan Democrats) stated that they had chosen to do so because they associated him with the economic recovery, because of his strong stance on national security issues with Russia, and because they considered the Democrats as \\"supporting American poor and minorities at the expense of the middle class.\\" These public opinion factors contributed to Reagan’s 1984 landslide victory, in Connecticut and elsewhere.

Early life and education Cloud graduated from Fife High School and received a B.A. in economics from the University of Washington before going on to earn a J.D. from the University of Washington School of Law. Career Legal work Cloud began his legal career working as a prosecutor for Pierce County and Kitsap County before opening a Tacoma, Washington based law firm in 1992. Political campaigns Cloud, a Republican, has faced longtime congressman Norm Dicks in the general election from Washington's 6th congressional district in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. His best showing was in 2010 when he received 42 percent of the vote. During that campaign he raised just short of $120,000 (40 percent of which was self- financed), being easily bested by Dicks who received $1.4 million in campaign donations. Cloud's worst performance was in 2006 when he earned less than 30-percent of the vote. In 2012, following Dicks' retirement, he again sought election from the sixth district but was eliminated in the primary. After his defeat in 2010, Cloud sued the U.S. government over the Federal Bureau of Investigation's rejection of a Freedom of Information Act request his campaign had filed regarding a federal investigation into Dicks. Cloud had asked for the investigative files of a FBI inquiry into Dicks' involvement with PMA Group, a lobbying firm accused of influence buying. The FBI had rejected the request on the grounds that fulfilling it would constitute an invasion of Dicks' privacy. The cornerstone of many of Cloud's past campaigns has been his opposition to the use of earmarks. He has made a special point of drawing attention to federal funding of the Puget Sound Partnership, a Washington state environmental agency formerly led by Dicks' son. \\"He [Dicks] used his power to set up multimillion-dollar funding to provide his kids with jobs duplicative of existing agencies,\\" Cloud has criticized. Dicks has defended himself by asking \\"why should we send people [to Congress] if they don't do something to help their district?\\" Cloud has also called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and increased enforcement of federal immigration law. He has signed the \\"taxpayer-protection pledge\\" circulated by Americans for Tax Reform. In addition to his frequent campaigns for a seat in the United States Congress, Cloud sought appointment to the Washington House of Representatives in 2013 to fill a vacancy created by the election of Jan Angel to the Washington Senate. He came in last place in a selection vote by local Republican leadership to succeed to the seat; Jesse Young was chosen by resolution of Kitsap County board of commissioners and Pierce County council from a list of recommendations provided by Republicans.

Early career Cogan graduated from Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine. From 1971 to 1973 he served in the United States Army as a general medical officer and briefly served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He completed his pathology residency at Loyola University Medical Center. Los Angeles County In 1977 he joined the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's and Coroner's Office. In 1986 he became senior medical examiner, the third-highest medical position in the department. He supervised deputy medical examiners and residents in forensic pathology. Autopsies performed by Cogan include those on Dennis Wilson and Charlotte Lamb (victim of Rodney Alcala). Acting Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner In 1990 Cogan was appointed acting Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner following the resignation of Ronald Kornblum. During his tenure in this position, the county's murder rate jumped by 18% and the office struggled to keep up with the high murder toll of 38 homicides per week. In 1991, the office conducted 6,256 autopsies and investigated 18,068 suspicious or violent deaths (including 2,401 possible homicides). Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana described the office as \\"operating smooth as glass\\" under Cogan. After the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' first selection for Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner, Dr. Joshua Perper of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, declined the job due to Los Angeles' high housing costs and its second choice, Dr. Yong-Myun Rho, of Queens, New York thrice failed the state medical exam, it appeared that Cogan would get the job. However, the department's chief of forensic medicine, Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, was selected instead after the Board of Supervisors received a letter signed by several deputy medical examiners recommending the consideration of in house candidates rather than appointing an outsider. Cook County Cogan later left Los Angeles to serve as an assistant medical examiner in Cook County, Illinois. He was also contracted to perform autopsies for Kane County, Illinois.

His main area of responsibility is Syria. While working for AIUK, Benedict has been involved in grassroots activism. For example, he has helped plant olive trees and has dined with Palestinian families and listened to their stories. Early life and education Benedict was born in Lancashire and is of Indian and Trinidadian descent. He received a master's degree in communication, culture and society at Goldsmiths, University of London, in 1997. Career Benedict began to work for Amnesty International UK in 2003. He has worked as the organization's Middle East Campaign Manager and as Campaign Manager for China. He became campaigns manager in 2006. He is the campaign manager for Crisis work with a focus on Syria at AIUK, which means that his primary professional responsibility is for Syria. Nonetheless, he spends “a significant amount of his time as an advocate for the human rights of Palestinians and Israelis caught up in the long running conflict.” Syria After UK Foreign Secretary William Hague announced in August 2012 that the UK would be aiding Syrian opposition groups, Benedict said: “Practical measures which aim to protect all of Syria's civilians are to be welcomed.” He encouraged the UK to help “develop the awareness and mechanisms to ensure the armed opposition leadership make clear to their forces that war crimes and human rights abuses will never be tolerated.” He added that the UK “needs to be crystal clear with the commanders of Syria’s armed opposition that they have a duty to prevent war crimes by those under their command. The UK should also emphasise to them that they may be held criminally responsible if they fail to do so.” He summed up by saying that AI “wants to see a Syria which genuinely respects and protects everybody’s human rights” and that “instilling and expanding human rights values in the armed and civilian opposition is a key part of that process.” \\"We are telling the Syria opposition that the Geneva Conventions covers them as organised armed groups and they will be held responsible for what they do and what they fail to prevent,\\" Benedict told The Daily Telegraph in August 2012. \\"We have seen video of people being executed with machineguns - clearly that's a war crime.\\" After FSA fighters killed bound captives from the Berri clan in Aleppo in August 2012, Benedict said that to applaud that crime while claiming to support human rights in Syria “is a gross hypocrisy”. In November 2012, after Hague met with Syrian opposition figures in London, Benedict commented that Hague “must insist on practical actions not just fine words to prevent opposition abuses. We need to see proper accountability with any fighters accused of abuses detained and proper investigations mounted.” “Instead of talking about immunity deals for President Assad,” Benedict said in November 2012, “David Cameron should be supporting efforts to ensure that he faces justice, ideally at the International Criminal Court at The Hague.” Citing the Syrian government's “massive campaign of indiscriminate bombings, mass round-ups and torture,” he maintained that “there should be no question of Bashar al-Assad escaping justice with a cosy deal of this kind,” because “Syrians who have lost relatives are entitled to and deserve credible justice, and President Assad and his commanders must be held to account for their brutal actions.” In a March 2013 article about the ongoing crisis in Syria, Benedict turned the focus to Israel, writing that \\"some Syrian opposition activists, fighters and politicians have suggested the reason arms are not flowing from the UK and the US to the 'Free Syrian Army' is because the 'West wants to protect Israel'.\\" He commented that it was \\"not unreasonable\\" to hypothesize that \\"a possible 'threat' to Israelis enters into the strategic calculations of the US, UK and others,\\" and complained that the US takes a \\"near non existent human rights approach...to the wider Israel / Palestine issue.\\" Benedict went on to rehearse the history of Israeli's occupation of the Golan Heights, declaring that the \\"establishment and retention of civilian settlements in occupied territory violates international law\\" and calling on the US, UK, and other countries to address \\"the matter of long standing Israeli government impunity.\\" Criticism of Israel Benedict, has argued that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has persisted because the U.S. \\"plays both Arab and Israel sides to generate money, power and control.\\" He has compared Israel to apartheid South Africa and the Soviet Union, and has implied that he looks forward to Israel's system of oppression falling as those countries systems of oppression fell. He has coordinated a number of anti-Zionist/pro-Palestinian events for AIUK according to Zionist government organisations, and in several of these cases he has collaborated with British journalist and author Ben White. In a March 2011 news release written by Benedict, AIUK accused Israel of \\"ignoring\\" the \\"victims\\" in Gaza for over two years and asked the UN Security Council to refer the Gaza situation to the International Criminal Court. \\"Israel,\\" he said in a 2012 interview, \\"is now included in the list of stupid dictatorial regimes who abuse peoples’ basic universal rights – along with Burma, North Korea, Iran and Sudan, its government has the same wanton attitude to human beings.\\" He attributed to its current government \\"a feeling of 'ethnic supremacy'\\" and described Israelis as being afflicted by \\"blatant racism,\\" comparing their attitudes to those of “the BNP members in the north of England.” He said that Jewish settlers in Hebron throw \\"bottles, sticks and bags filled with liquid – sometimes their own urine\\" from the windows of their flats onto Palestinian passersby. And he accused Israel of hiding the truth about conditions on the Gaza Strip from the foreign media. When asked by The Jewish Chronicle newspaper if Amnesty would be urging action on behalf of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza, Benedict said that this could be done but changed the subject to the thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, saying that \\"We will have to do that if we want to be consistent.\\" He responded to charges of being one- sided or anti-Semitic by pro-Israeli government organisations by insisting that his views are founded in international human rights law and international humanitarian law. \\"Amnesty,\\" he said, \\"is not worried about being accused of bias in the face of obvious atrocious human rights violations. We have a passion against all forms of injustice in the world. As for those who loosely throw about the term anti-Semitism as an attempt to gag us, we tell them to take their concerns to the Israeli government. The real delegitimising of Israel is its government’s behaviour when they act outside of the law.\\" He added: \\"I think those in the Israeli government, who are fanatical, think that if they can make life miserable enough then the Palestinians will leave. The blockade of Gaza has turned it into an outdoor prison.\\" He has also claimed, in line with Amnesty International research on the issue , that Israel has engaged in a \\"deliberate denial of water\\" to Palestinians in Gaza \\"as a means of expelling them from the land.\\" Benedict described the Israeli government in 2012 as being \\"more right-wing\\" than before \\"and less tolerant of the human rights narrative we give,\\" and expressed agreement with the statement in the 2009 Goldstone Report that Israel's \\"treatment of Palestine is meant to punish, humiliate and terrorize.\\" In tweets sent out in late 2012, Benedict wrote such things as: \\"How soon before Israel brings out the flechettes & white phosphorus given that 'All options are on the table'?\\" and \\"Israel continues to 'defend' its apartheid state by bombing families in#Gaza. Palestinians will not sit back and receive your death wishes.\\" NGO Monitor documented that he called Operation Pillar of Defense \\"Israel’s murder campaign\\" and advocated BDS. 2008 China comment “With dissenters silenced within China it's more important than ever that pressure comes from outside the country,” Benedict said in 2008. “We'd encourage anyone involved in the [Beijing Olympic] Games to find out what's really happening in China and to consider speaking out against human rights abuses.” 2011 comment to audience member A 2011 article charging that AI has undergone a “moral decline,” and quoting Christopher Hitchens on its “degeneration and politicization,” maintained that “Amnesty's UK branch has a particular anti- Israel obsession,” and cited an AIUK event at which an audience member who writes a pro Israeli government blog who challenged a claim about a purported Israeli action was told by Benedict that he would “smack me in my little bald head.” The audience member posted an audio recording of the exchange online. 2012 B52 tweet In November 2012 Benedict drew criticism for a tweet that was alleged to be anti-Semitic by pro Israeli government commentators. In the context of a British parliamentary discussion on violence in Syria and Gaza, he singled out three Jewish MPs for supporting Israel's campaign against Hamas. The tweet read “Louise Ellman, Robert Halfon and Luciana Berger walk into a bar… each orders a round of B52s… #Gaza.” A B52 is a type of long-range strategic bomber, but it is also the name of a popular cocktail. It was reported that after the tweet, AIUK “launched a disciplinary process,” saying that “the matter has been referred to our internal and confidential processes.” AI campaigns director Tim Hancock said, “We do not believe that humor is appropriate in the current circumstances, particularly from our own members of staff.”The organisation did not consider the tweet in question anti-Semitic though and Benedict continues to work at Amnesty International UK. Benedict deleted the tweet from his account. This controversy came at a time when many critics, including the UK’s Zionist Federation, were criticizing what they called Benedict's “one-sided view of the conflict.” Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), accused Benedict of insensitivity and called on him to issue a public apology. In a letter to Amnesty International, MP John Mann, chairman of the “All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism,” said the tweet had crossed the line between legitimate criticism and anti-Semitism. Responding to criticism of his tweeted “joke,” Benedict argued that it was merely coincidental that he had named three Jewish MPs and insisted that he focused on “views not religion.” 2012 ZF accusation In 2012 the Zionist Federation of the United Kingdom (ZF) accused Benedict of a demonstrated anti-Israel bias, saying he had “regularly shown a partisan approach” when dealing with the country. 2012 Kurd criticism In February 2012 Benedict was criticized by some Kurds when he refused to allow Kurdish activists to participate in a planned “Arab spring solidarity rally.” When a Kurdish protester asked Benedict to include a Kurd, Benedict walked away having explained all speakers were on a set list and nobody new could be added. Events In April 2005, Benedict conducted an interview with Saverio Contanzo, the director of “Private,” a film that is highly critical of Israeli soldiers and of Israeli policies in the Occupied Territories. Benedict described the film as showing “a family subjected to a violation of their privacy, family life, home and dignity” In May 2009 Benedict chaired a discussion forum focused on learning from bereaved families in Israel and the “Occupied Palestinian Territories.” In September 2009, Benedict hosted an event featuring Jeff Halper, director of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions and critic of Israel's “apartheid strategy.” According to an account of the event, “Halper gave irrefutable evidence of Israel’s apartheid strategy which is to deny any possibility of an independent Palestinian State.” Halper also called on President Obama to order Israel to retreat to its 1967 borders. In July 2010, Benedict promoted an AIUK event featuring Combatants for Peace, a group devoted to ending the Israeli \\"occupation\\" of Palestinian territories. \\"What Combatants for Peace’s members are doing is remarkable,\\" Benedict said, \\"and we support them in their aim of seeing Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully together with their human rights and dignity respected and protected.\\" In April 2011, Benedict chaired a screening of \\"War Child,\\" a movie which focuses on the child survivors of Operation Cast Lead and \\"gives a voice to those whose lives were changed forever through the tragedy of war.\\" In April 2012, Benedict was one of the key speakers at an event hosted by the Palestine Film Foundation in association with AIUK and Adalah: The Legal Centre for Arab Minority Rights in Israel. After a screening of three short films, Benedict and Adalah lawyer Suhad Bishara discussed “threats faced by Palestinians in Israel today.” References 1974 births Living people Amnesty International people Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London People from Lancashire ","title":"Kristyan Benedict"},{"id":"41229346","text":"David Eric England (born February 23, 1988) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.

While attending Yerington High School, Dodge became an all-state receiver for the Yerington Lions high school football team, but ultimately made the decision to join the United States Army when he wasn't offered a single athletic scholarship to play college football.  Military career  While serving in the U.S. Army from April 2000 to January 2004, Dodge was assigned to the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as \\"The Old Guard,\\" the U.S. Army's honor guard that serves at both military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and for various national ceremonies. On the morning of September 11th, 2001, Dodge was at the Pentagon filing his application for a White House security clearance. As he watched news coverage of the unfolding attacks on the World Trade Center, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west wall of the Pentagon building. Following the crash, Dodge and his fellow Old Guard members, stationed at the nearby Fort Myer, were mobilized and sent to the crash site. Initially, Dodge was instructed to set up tents for survivors. Once the fires were extinguished, Dodge and his fellow soldiers were then sent into the wreckage to search for the bodies and remains of victims, which were then accounted for and collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the following weeks, the Old Guard continued searching for victims during the day, and patrolled the capital at night.  College football career  Following the September 11th attacks, as well as his own experiences at the Pentagon, Dodge suffered from post-traumatic stress. \\"I broke down . . . and cried for the families and cried for my family,\\" Dodge said in a 2006 interview. Ultimately, Dodge decided not to pursue his military career further. Instead, Dodge planned to attend college with the intention of playing football at the collegiate level. He also planned to reconcile with his estranged father. \\"We both kind of realized we have one life together,\\" Dodge said in 2006. In the fall of 2004, at the age of 23, after achieving the U.S. Army rank of sergeant and reconciling with his father, Dodge enrolled at Feather River College, a two-year community college in Quincy, California. Quickly, Dodge's performance at inside linebacker gained him national attention from Division I college football programs offering him athletic scholarships. After two seasons at Feather River, Dodge chose Texas A&M; University, citing its Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) military tradition as the deciding factor in his decision. Dodge enrolled at Texas A&M; in January 2006. Over the course of the Texas A&M; Aggies football team's spring practices in 2006, Dodge achieved the starting role at inside linebacker and retained it throughout the following summer. Although he did not start the season opener (the result of an ankle injury), on September 2, 2006, at the age of 25 – three to six years older than all of his teammates – Dodge played in his first Division I football game at Texas A&M;'s Kyle Field against The Citadel. On his first play, Dodge recorded a tackle for a loss. He finished the game with seven tackles and was credited with an assist on a forced fumble in the Aggies' 35-3 victory. Dodge's story gained national attention when in September 2006, ESPN's \\"College Game Day\\" featured a segment in which Dodge was interviewed about his experiences during the September 11th Attacks, as well his experience with college football. \\"You see stuff like that and it gives you a whole new thought on life; you never know when it can end, you got to take every day as it is. Enjoy every day. I mean, I go out to practice now and love it at practice for every practice because I know I could be doing something a whole lot worse,\\" Dodge said. Having won the starting position, Dodge played linebacker for two seasons at Texas A&M; in 2006 and 2007. As a junior in 2006, Dodge tied for the leading number of interceptions for the team with two. As a senior in 2007, he led the team with 117 total tackles. He ended his two-year college career in 2007, finishing with 168 total tackles, two forced fumbles and two interceptions. Following his senior season, he received honorable mention All-Big 12 honors.\\" 2007 All-Big 12 Football Awards Announced,\\" Big 12 Conference (November 27, 2007). Retrieved August 3, 2014.  Life after football  On May 2, 2011, following the killing of Osama Bin Ladin, Dodge was asked in an interview how, following the announcement of Bin Ladin's killing, his experiences at the Pentagon had resurfaced in his thoughts: > \\"[Sunday] night, after they announced that he had been killed, I thought > back to burying all of the people that he actually killed. Younger people > and families . . . it wasn't just military. It's a big difference from when > you're at War and it's a soldier that gets killed. With all of these > families and civilians that got killed and with planes flying into the World > Trade Center… you look at that stuff and it blows your mind that someone > would feel that way against another human being, no matter the > circumstances. I looked back at that stuff and I laid there for hours > thinking about where I was [on September 11, 2001] and how it's changed. It > was really cool. I think that the most emotional part of it was that for a > little bit, you saw all of the people of United States – Democrat, > Republican and no matter the race or the status – everybody came together > and it was all for the one cause. That happened after [September 11] . . . > the nation came together for months. It’s unfortunate that things can't > remain like that and that people aren't able to work with each other.\\" References 1980 births Living people American football linebackers People from Yerington, Nevada Players of American football from Nevada Texas A&M; Aggies football players United States Army soldiers ","title":"Mark Dodge"},{"id":"41229382","text":"The Interethnic Placement Act, also known as IEPA or the Interethnic Placement Provisions (Pub.

IEPA eliminated some unclear language in MEPA about cultural considerations in the foster care and adoption processes. IEPA's primary purpose was to eliminate racial discrimination during federally funded foster care and adoption placements so that children will not be delayed nor denied placement based on their race, color, or national origin. This protection against discrimination also extends to foster and adoptive parents. IEPA established financial penalties for states that do not comply with these provisions. IEPA also reiterated MEPA's requirement that agencies need to recruit more racially diverse foster and adoptive parents in order to reflect the diverse children in need of placements. IEPA's provisions do not apply to children protected under the Indian Child Welfare Act.

The land is planted with several species, including Hibiscus tiliaceus and Codiaeum variegatum. The temple is located in Kadisoka hamlet, Kalasan, Sleman, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, part of the fertile Kewu Plain. It is surrounded by agricultural fields, with the Kuning River running to the east. The temple is some north of Sambisari and located at an altitude of . The temple is made of andesite; its stones are in fairly good condition, with little microbial growth. Its architectural style is thought to have been quite similar to that of the numerous other temples found in the Kewu Plain, based on the shape of the bell and half-circle shape of the base. It is oriented to the west, though off by about 10 degrees. Kadisoka is maintained by two people, tasked with cleaning the site, reporting damage, and receiving visitors (be they tourists or pilgrims). Access to the site is limited by its dirt path, which becomes muddy during the rainy season. History The excavation area Kadisoka Temple in 2015 Kadisoka Temple in 2015 Kadisoka is thought to have been built around the eighth century. According to Véronique Degroot, it was not completed; she writes that only some five layers of the base were completed. It was buried by lahar flows running down the Kuning River on two separate occasions, thought to have been at least a century apart. The temple was eventually under of earth. The temple at Kadisoka is generally identified as a Hindu temple, based on the layout of the cella: in its centre archaeologists have found a pit, a feature thought only to be found in Hindu temples. The temple was rediscovered by a sand miner on 7 December 2000 and reported to the Balai Pelestarian Peninggalan Purbakala (Department for the Preservation of Prehistoric Artefacts). After preliminary examinations looked promising, in February 2001 excavation began; it had soon uncovered the entirety of the temple's eastern foundation as well as the temple pit. Within the pit excavators found some semi-precious stones, gold, and a box containing a gold plaque engraved with a lotus flower. As of 2010 the majority of the temple remains buried.

Reception The Christian Science Monitor called the play \\"essentially immature and inconclusive.\\" The New York Times said it \\"contains several interesting scenes, offers two excellent tenement settings... and bits of engaging acting... this correspondent was never bored... but it could never believe his melodrama. It looked very like a loosely contrived and whimsical play, more interested in bravaura scenes than integrity.\\" Production history The Broadway production closed after seven performances.

In 2013, he was arrested in North Korea, and released 42 days later.

Career According to Newman's family, he served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. As a member of the White Tigers, he advised a UNPIK guerrilla unit at some time between 1950 and 1953. He later worked in technology and financial consulting. After serving in the army, Newman was a high school teacher and, later, an executive for technology companies in Silicon Valley.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/us/back-in- korea-60-years-later-and-finding-a-war-is-still-on.html?_r=0 2013 arrest In October 2013, Newman left his home in Palo Alto, California, for North Korea as part of a nine-day trip organized by Juche Travel Services, a travel agency that specializes in trips to North Korea. According to family members, Newman had generally been enjoying his trip and had communicated with them via telephone and postcards. On October 26, after boarding an Air Koryo airliner in Pyongyang on which he was scheduled to depart the country, Newman was removed by a single, uniformed official. Newman's traveling companion reported the arrest to U.S. officials via telephone upon the aircraft's arrival in Beijing later that day. U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki discusses travel safety in North Korea for American citizens during the department's daily press briefing on November 21, 2013. On November 20, the San Jose Mercury News first reported on Newman's detention. In response to media inquiries, the United States Department of State confirmed that a U.S. citizen had recently been arrested in North Korea, but refused to specifically discuss the case beyond generally noting they were working with Sweden, the protecting power of the United States, to secure his release. Officials noted that the individual in question (generally accepted to be Newman) had not filed a privacy act waiver, which legally prevented them from providing specifics regarding the case to the press. On November 21, former New Mexico governor turned diplomat Bill Richardson confirmed to Reuters that he was \\"in touch with his North Korean contacts\\" regarding Newman.Bill Richardson in touch with North Korea over detained American At some point by or before November 22, DPRK authorities acknowledged to Swedish consular staff that they were holding Newman. On November 29, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released a video showing Newman signing a letter of apology and confession for war crimes committed during the Korean War. According to the accompanying report, the video had been recorded the preceding November 9. It went on to state that Newman had \\"masterminded espionage and subversive activities against North Korea and in this course he was involved in killings of service personnel of the Korean People's Army and innocent civilians\\" and that, during his visit, Newman had been found with an e-book containing subversive material. The KCNA story also reported that Newman said he had served during the Korean War as a military adviser to the \\"Kuwol unit of the U.N. Korea 6th Partisan Regiment\\" and had asked his government tour guides to help him contact surviving members of the Kuwol Partisan Comrades-in-Arms Association. (United Nations Partisan Infantry Korea units were clandestine, special forces groups that operated during the Korean War and whose activities were not publicly acknowledged until 1990.) Kim Heyon, the former member of Newman's Korean War military unit, said that the irregular warfare engaged in by the partisan units had left Newman a permanently marked man in North Korea: \\"They detained him because he served in the Kuwol regiment. He is just a very bad guy for them.\\" Dan Sneider, a North Korea specialist at Stanford University, remarked that \\"it seems that Mr. Newman inadvertently walked into a historical minefield that he wasn't fully aware of.\\" Newman was held in a room in Yanggakdo Hotel, North Korea's largest operating hotel. By December 1, the Swedish ambassador to North Korea, Karl-Olof Andersson, had visited Newman for the first time and found him to be in good health. At the same time, the United States National Security Council issued a statement requesting Newman's release, referring to Newman by name and also calling for the repatriation of Kenneth Bae. A Reuters report published later that day confirmed Newman's membership in the Kuwol regiment of the United Nations Partisan Infantry Korea. The Reuters article also revealed that Newman had twice visited South Korea, on both occasions wearing a commemorative ring that identified him as a former partisan. (No mention was made as to whether Newman had worn the same ring during his trip to North Korea.) Details of Newman's military exploits had been included in a book published in South Korea and edited by a member of Newman's unit, Kim Heyon. Another partisan veteran stated that North Korean intelligence had obtained the complete roster of the Kuwol regiment, on which Newman's name was included, prior to the Korean War armistice. Together, these facts seemed to indicate that Newman's background was beyond concealment. On December 7, Newman was released. After flying from Pyongyang to Beijing, Newman met with U.S. Embassy officials, who bought him a ticket to San Francisco International Airport; a medical officer provided him with medications, and cleared him to fly. Newman boarded the flight the same day, declining an offer from Vice President Joe Biden, who was touring East Asia at the same time, to take a later flight out of Seoul on Air Force Two. After returning to the United States, Newman declined interview requests from media but casually remarked he had been well taken care of and held in comfortable conditions during his detention. Newman did not immediately retract his written confession, however, and \\"smirked\\" at a reporter who asked him about it. In a subsequent written statement released by Newman's family, Newman declared his confession had been coerced, writing that \\"the words were not mine and were not delivered voluntarily.\\" In the same statement, however, Newman confirmed the veracity of the earlier KCNA report that he had requested his North Korean tour guides put him in contact with former anti-communist insurgents, but claimed it was for reasons of \\"curiosity\\" and his intention in making contact with guerrilla fighters had been \\"misinterpreted ... as something more sinister.\\" Personal life As of 2013, Newman was living with his wife in Channing House, a Palo Alto retirement community. Family members said that, at the time of his arrest, Newman suffered from a heart condition for which he needed medication. In 2014, journalist Mike Chinoy published an e-book about Newman's detention, The Last P.O.W.

An accompanying book was also published. Episodes 1. \\"Apeman – Spaceman\\" First broadcast: 9:00 pm, 7 Oct 2014 on BBC Two Brian charts our story from apes to the birth of civilization and ultimately to the stars. Beginning in Ethiopia, Professor Brian Cox discovers how the universe played a key role in our ascent from apeman to spaceman by driving the expansion of our brains. But big brains alone did not get us to space. To reveal what did, Brian heads out of Africa, to the ancient city of Petra in Jordan, where he unpicks the next part of our story – the birth of civilization – and then on to Kazakhstan, where he witnesses the return of astronauts from space and explains what took us from civilization to the stars. 2. \\"Why Are We Here?\\" First broadcast: 9:00 pm, 14 Oct 2014 on BBC Two Brian Cox tackles the question that unites the 7 billion people on Earth: Why are we here? Brian reveals how the wonderful complexity of nature and human life is simply the consequence of chance events constrained by the laws of physics that govern our universe. But this leads him to a deeper question – why does our universe seem to have been set up with just the right rules to create us? In a dizzying conclusion Brian unpacks this question, revealing the very latest understanding of how the universe came to be this way, and in doing so offers a radical new answer to why we are here. 3. \\"Are We Alone?\\" First broadcast: 9:00 pm, 21 Oct 2014 on BBC Two Brian Cox explores mankind's place in the universe. He considers the possibility of alien life – could it exist and will humans ever find it? Brian discusses the Wow! signal, Drake equation and explains the ingredients needed for an intelligent civilization to evolve in the universe – the need for a benign star, for a habitable planet, for life to spontaneously arise on such a planet and the time required for intelligent life to evolve and build a civilization. Brian weighs the evidence and arrives at his own provocative answer to the puzzle of our apparent solitude. He argues that the difficulty inherent in the development of eukaryotic cells represents such a barrier to the emergence of intelligent life that Earth may be the only planet where this has taken place in the Milky Way galaxy. In this episode Brian also tells us how Kepler observes into deep space seeking other solar systems just like our very own – How many potential 'earth-like' planets are there in the galaxy? 4. \\"A Place in Space and Time\\" First broadcast: 9:00 pm, 28 October 2014 on BBC Two Professor Brian Cox explores our origins, place and destiny in the universe. He describes the initial conditions of the human psyche as one that places itself at the center of the universe, surrounded by family, environment, and events. Brian tells the story of how our innate human curiosity has led us from feeling that we are at the center of everything, to our modern understanding of our true place in space and time – that we are living 13.8 billion years from the beginning of the universe, on a mere speck of rock in a possibly infinite expanse of space. The story begins with Brian climbing to the summit of the fortified village of Ait-Ben-Haddou in the foothills of Morocco's Atlas Mountains. Here he demonstrates how the stars' motion across the night sky appears to make our central position self-evident. Thanks to the artisan glass-blowers of Renaissance Venice, Galileo was able to build the first telescope and discover our orbital position around the sun—relegating us to just one among a number of planets and effecting our demotion from the center of the universe. 5. \\"What is Our Future?\\" First broadcast: 9:00 pm, 4 Nov 2014 on BBC Two In the final episode of the series, Professor Brian Cox explores the future of our home planet, its unfolding relationship with the rest of the universe, and its effect on our destiny as a species. Production Human Universe was commissioned by Janice Hadlow for BBC Two and Kim Shillinglaw, head commissioner for science and natural history. The series consists of five sixty-minute episodes.

Early life and education  Vasantrao Patil was born on 25 March 1922 to a Kuruba-Patil (Dhangar) family in Byakud village, Bombay state. He was born to Shri Sidagouda and Smt. Anandibai Patil. Patil had an older sister and a younger brother, Hutatma Prataprao. His ancestors administrated the surrounding region on behalf of Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur (Shahaji II). He began his higher education at Rajaram College, Kolhapur, but was unable to complete his degree due to his involvement in the freedom movement.  Freedom movement  Under influence of his teachers like Dr. M.R. Desai, Acharya Jawadekar, N.S. Hardikar and Barrister Khardekar, Vasantrao was instilled the spirit of patriotism and social service. While in Kolhapur he came in contact with a radical freedom fighter by the name of Nana Patil (Kranti Sinha), who further bolstered his decision to take part in the freedom struggle. Under Nana's guidance both Vasantrao and Prataprao became heavily involved in orchestrating skirmishes in the areas which are today known as Southern Maharashtra and North Karnataka. This led to the assassination of his younger brother Prataprao. Due to the grief of losing his only brother, Vasantrao left college in 1943 and became fully involved in the freedom struggle. As Vasantrao's reputation strengthened, he became one of the most wanted men in the region, leading to a 'shoot at sight' imposition by the British administration.  Political career  Patil first entered politics when he was elected M.L.A. from Chikodi Raibagh in 1952 as an Independent candidate, and became the first elected representative for the area post independence. In 1957 he contested successfully once again as an Independent candidate from Raibag, which was merged into the newly created State of Karnataka. He won the election with a significant majority and in addition to this, wielded considerable power across Bombay-Karnataka districts. These events stunned Pandit Nehru, the Prime Minister of India at the time. This caused Nehru to invite Patil to Delhi because Nehru wanted to see the person who had shattered the 'Congress storm'. Nehru invited him to the Congress Party but Patil rejected the offer, as he was a staunch opponent of Nehruvian Socialism (however, he later joined the Congress Party after requests from senior leaders at the time). Below are details of further positions held by Patil: * 1962–1967 Member of Parliament from Chikkodi (IND) * 1968–1971 M.L.A. from Raibag & Minister of Social Welfare under the Veerendra Patil government (INC)http://www.elections.in/karnataka/assembly-constituencies/raibag.html Raibag (Karnataka) Assembly Constituency Elections * 1972–1977 M.L.A. from Raibag & Minister of Social Welfare and Horticulture under the Devraj Urs government(INC)https://elections.traceall.in/vidhan-sabha-assembly-election- results/Raibag-in-Karnataka Previous Year's Election Results in Raibag, Karnataka * Between 1972–77 he was member of Central Congress Working Committee and wielded great influence over the Congress Party in Karnataka. * 1983–1984 M.L.A. from Kagwad & Minister of Industries, Labour, Transportation and Revenue under the Ramakrishna Hegde government (JP) http://www.elections.in/karnataka/assembly-constituencies/kagwad.html Sitting and previous MLAs from Kagwad Assembly Constituency * 1985–1989 M.L.A. from Kagwad & Revenue Minister under the Ramakrishna Hegde and S.

It lies 430 million to 440 million light years away in the constellation Cetus and does not appear to be part of any significant galaxy group. The system was originally discovered in 1893 by Stephane Javelle and is listed in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. The system was formed when a spiral galaxy (image right) collided with an elliptical galaxy (image left). The collision produced an expanding wave of star production (shown as bright blue) traveling at an effective speed of ≳100 km s−1 and began some 40 million years ago. The most extreme period of star formation is estimated to have ended 15 million years ago and as the young, super hot stars died (as exploding supernovas) they left behind neutron stars and black holes. The right-side galaxy is 30,000 light years in diameter and is located 21,000 light years away from its partner galaxy. The entire system extends some 115,000 light years across. In September 2008, Hubble's main data-handling unit failed. After the problem was corrected, the telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 was aimed at Arp 147 and the quality of the images taken assured NASA that Hubble was working properly. Main ring The main ring contains nine bright X-ray sources which are black holes, each with a mass 10–20 times the mass of the Sun. The edge- to-edge expansion of the ring is 225 ± 8 km/s and there is very little rotation seen (47 ± 8 km/s). It also has a star formation rate of approximately 4.68 solar masses per year. The reddish bulge in the main ring is thought to be the original galactic nucleus of the primary galaxy and comprises 30–50% of the total mass of the galaxy. Smaller galaxy The smaller companion galaxy (left side) also contains an X-ray source which may be a poorly fed black hole.

As Bishop of Kraków he was concerned with the level of education of the clergy, was a supporter of a soft approach with dissenters. In 1546 he ordered an inspection visit of the diocese, which in concept at least, was to limit the influence of the Reformation, but due to the mildness of his character was largely ineffectual. He called a diocesan synod in 1547 at Wiślica but the resolution of the Synod has not been preserved.

Castles in the Sky is produced with Open University, BBC Two, BBC Scotland, BBC Worldwide and Creative Scotland with Glasgow Film Office, Robert Watson Watt Trust and Brechin Civic Trust. Filming took place in various locations on Scotland's east coast; on Dunbar Beach and Hedderwick Sands in East Lothian, Newbattle Abbey and Arniston House in Midlothian, Gosford House in Longniddry, and in Edinburgh. Mark Russell composed the musical score, whilst the costume designer was Gill Horn. Producer Wheeler said that he hoped the film would illuminate the \\"sex appeal\\" of science. He said, \\"The time is right for a contemporary approach to this rich and under-reported vein of British history—it's not like other war stories—if anything it's more akin to a combination of The Social Network and Chariots of Fire than The Dambusters or Reach for the Sky.\\" Reception The film was previewed at the Edinburgh Film Festival in June 2014. Variety took the view that there were \\"many ways in which 'Castles in the Sky' adheres timidly to biopic convention...from Mark Russell’s sugary score to Gill Horn’s elegant but unworn costumes.

He was appointed Minister of Agriculture of Argentina in November 2013, replacing Norberto Yauhar. Biography Born in Viedma, Río Negro Province, Casamiquela studied Agricultural Engineering at the National University of La Plata, graduating in 1973. He also held degrees in Local Economic Development from the National University of General San Martín and the Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain. He joined the National Agricultural Technology Institute (INTA) in 1974 as a topsoil specialist, and in 1980 returned to his home province by way of a transfer to INTA's Río Negro Upper Valley Experimental Station. His work as researcher focused on irrigation needs for the orchard-rich Upper Valley, and he went on to direct the facility between 1984 and 1990. He authored the \\"Project for the Restructuring of Fruticulture in Argentina\\" (1986), among 15 published research papers. Casamiquela was promoted to the post of INTA Regional Director for North Patagonia in 1990. He remained in the post until September 2003, when he was appointed Vice President of SENASA, the food safety regulatory office. The revival of the Agriculture Ministry as a cabinet-level office in 2009, and the appointment of Buenos Aires Province Legislator Julián Domínguez to the post, was followed by Casamiquela's appointment as President of the INTA by Minister Domínguez in October of that year. Casamiquela oversaw the continued revitalization of INTA, which grew from 3,500 employees in 2003 to 7,200 by 2010, while focusing its efforts on the promotion of local agriculture and small farmers (who employ 54% of all agricultural workers in Argentina). INTA's Prohuerta program, launched in 2005, provided assistance to 630,000 market gardens and 148,000 small farms by 2013, as well as 19,000 rural families in Haiti. Other highlights during his tenure include an instructional program for intensive agriculture methods initiated in South Africa, and the approval for import by China of two of INTA's GMO soy and one GMO maize varieties. A cabinet reshuffle by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in late 2013 led to the resignation of Agriculture Minister Norberto Yauhar and his replacement by Casamiquela. His nomination was welcomed by the head of the influential Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA), Rubén Ferrero, who remarked that \\"we've know him for a long time, and he's knowledgeable about the problems facing agriculture in Argentina; we hope he'll be given the necessary latitude to implement the policy changes we've been advocating for some time now.\\" He died from COVID-19 on 12 September 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina.

He died in Charlotte Street, 11 March 1823, and was buried in a vault under the middle aisle of Bloomsbury Church. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society, and led a quiet life. Works Bingley was a prolific writer, and several of his works were popular. His Tour round North Wales, the result of his college vacation of 1798, was published in 1800 in two volumes. He revisited the district in 1801, and in 1804 issued North Wales ... delineated from two excursions. A second edition appeared in 1814, and a third, with corrections and additions by his son, William Richard Bingley, in 1839. As a companion to these works there appeared a volume entitled Sixty of the most admired Welsh Airs, collected by W. Bingley, arranged for the piano by William Russell in 1803, and again in 1810. One of the most popular of Bingley's compilation was Animal Biography (1802), on natural history. The sixth edition appeared in 1824, and the work was translated into several European languages. A related volume Memoirs of British Quadrupeds, appeared in 1809. His Practical Introduction to Botany was published in 1817, and republished after the author's death in 1827. In 1814 he drew up a volume on Animated Nature, and two years later he compiled a work on Useful Knowledge, an account of the various productions of nature, mineral, vegetable, and animal, frequently reissued with the seventh edition appearing in 1862. One set of Bingley's works was composed of \\"biographical conversations\\"; he narrated the lives of 'British characters,' 'eminent voyagers,' 'celebrated travellers,' and 'Roman characters.' Another consisted of condensed accounts \\"from modern writers\\" of Africa, South America, North America, South Europe, North Europe, and Asia, in six volumes appearing between 1819 and 1822. They were reproduced with a general title-page of Modern Travels. A planned county history of Hampshire took up much of Bingley's time; it had backing from Brownlow North. In 1817, when the manuscripts amounted to 6,000 pages, he had to explain the delay to subscribers. Thirty copies of a small portion of it, The Topographical Account of the Hundred of Bosmere, were printed for private circulation. Bingley's dictionary of Musical Biography appeared anonymously in 1814; it was reissued with his name on the title-page in 1834. At Christchurch he published (1805), from the originals in the possession of a Wiltshire lady, three volumes of Correspondence between Frances, Countess of Hereford, and the Countess of Pomfret, 1738-41. Most of the copies of the second edition were destroyed by fire. He also wrote a sermon on the Economy of a Christian Life (1822), and a handbook to the Leverian Museum.

It was conceived from a desire to explore different directions in the electro musical sphere, from pure synthpop to dark and menacing electro and EBM. In 2013, the band released three albums, including a limited edition semi-live recording session. True to its self- imposed remit of exploration, the Rossetti's Compass catalogue of works includes track remixes for bands from across the genre, including A.W.o.L. Angst Pop, Kant Kino, HNN, Technomancer, Shatoo, Attrition, and Naked Lunch.  Formation and Evolution  Rossetti's Compass was conceived by Mark Warner during a 2010 visit to Berlin where he was working with Oppenheimer Analysis members Andy Oppenheimer and Martin Lloyd (now deceased). At the time an active member of the Minimal Wave band Sudeten Creche, Warner was keen to explore the wider EBM sphere, and his early Rossetti's Compass compositions were used as set fillers by Sudeten Creche on their short European tour in April 2011. After Warner split from Sudeten Creche in late 2012, Rossetti's Compass began to grow. A successful collaboration on the first Rossetti's Compass EP, Tear Garden, released in March 2013, led to the synthpop master and former member of Apoptygma Berzerk, Per Aksel Lundgreen, joined Rossetti's Compass as a permanent member. A second EP, My Beloved, was released in August 2013. Like Tear Garden, it was mastered by Martin Bowes, a long-time friend of Lundgreen and a member of the British dark industrial music act Attrition. This second EP release coincided with Bowes joining the band as its third member, completing the current Rossetti's Compass line-up. In November 2013, the band recorded a third, semi-live album entitled Cage Sessions 01, which included guest vocals by Bowes' Engram partner John Costello. The Cage Sessions are a Martin Bowes innovation inspired by the old John Peel band sessions, where musicians spend one day in the studio recording several tracks, and are interviewed at the same time. It is a chance for them to do something a little different. Profits from this release were donated by Rossetti's Compass to Cancer Research. Recording work has started on a full album by Rossetti's Compass, with its release anticipated in early 2014, to coincide with a series of live gigs, the first in the band's history.  Name  The name Rossetti's Compass encapsulates the idea of freedom of musical exploration that is the cornerstone of the band's ethos. While it expresses the concept of direction, this is driven from the heart by passion, thus casting aside the constraints of conformity.  Musical style  The defining sound of Rossetti's Compass lies among the distinctive multilayered textures of synthpop, and the hard, minimal, rhythmic beat of electronic body music (EBM), and everywhere in between. At the EBM end of the spectrum the sound could stylistically be labelled as \\"dirty pop\\" or \\"future pop\\". Clearly illustrating the diversity of the Rossetti's Compass range, the first EP, Tear Garden, was described as \\"covering almost every phase of electro music\\". A diverse array of musical influences is behind the Rossetti's Compass sound, reflecting the exploratory nature of its music. Key influences include electro bands from across the genre, such as Kraftwerk, Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle, Click Click, The Klinik, A Split-Second, hard CORPS, Test Dept and Portion Control. Additional strains of punk derive from the likes of D.A.F., Sex Pistols, The Clash and early Siouxsie and the Banshees, with new wave influences coming from bands such as The Human League, The B-52's, Tuxedomoon and Devo. Further rock and synthpop influences are found in the form of Yazoo, Bowie, Roxy Music, The Velvet Underground, The Legendary Pink Dots, Leather Nun and Joy Division.

Due to the poor performance of Spanish archers at the previous world championships, the Spanish Sports Federation for Persons with Physical Disabilities did not provide funding for Marin or other Spanish archers to compete at this event. Funding instead came from regional sports federations. Club Arquero Chiclana organized the 2012 Spanish national championships in June 2012. Marin finished first there in the W2 standing recurve event. Following the merger of the Spanish archery federations for archers with disabilities and those without, a combined national championship was held in February 2013.

Founded in 2012, the INMG aims to expand and increase the audience for contemporary culture by exhibiting art outside the physical walls of a traditional museum, and providing an educational framework for discussion both online and offline. The INMG is dedicated to exploring current debates and topics in art history: touching on areas such as migration, war, environmental activism and the internet itself. The gallery has had three exhibitions to date: *Corinne Silva: Wandering Abroadhttp://www.inmg.org.uk/archive/silva/ Corinne Silva: Wandering Abroad (2012–13) * Thomson & Craighead: A Short Film About Warhttp://www.inmg.org.uk/archive/thomson-craighead/ Thomson & Craighead: A Short Film About War (2013) * Amy Balkin: (In)visible Matterhttp://www.inmg.org.uk/balkin/ Amy Balkin: (In)visible Matter (2013–14) Planned future exhibitions will include work by Ursula Biemann. The INMG's curators have described how they were interested in 'blurring' the boundaries between online and offline; explaining that \\"Our project was never intended to be online only. From the beginning we have considered the hosting of offline events as fundamental to our curatorial practice\\". The INMG have hosted reading groups and talks at Carroll/Fletcher gallery, Sussex University and UCL; collaborating with groups like the Centre for the Study of Contemporary Art (UCL). Nevertheless, the INMG's online discussion forums are important to the gallery's practice, and have thrown up some interesting questions, such as: \\"This isn't a gallery, i would argue. what distinguishes it from youtube?\\". Unlike YouTube, the INMG's exhibitions are curated, not user- generated. However, the gallery's participation programme has launched a project that explores the potential middle ground between the two. The INMG is also unlike many other online galleries in that it publishes extensive catalogues online, free to download. Its contributors are largely postgraduates or academics, including figures such as TJ Demos and Alan Ingram.http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/about-the-department/people/academic- staff/alan-ingram Alan Ingram The notion of public space or a commons is a re- occurring theme in the catalogues published by the gallery so far. In one, Corinne Silva reflects, \\"I want the work to have life beyond the physical gallery, so having it on the web and contextualised through the International New Media Gallery is really exciting. I could be really precious and say that I don't want it to be seen on a tiny screen or watched on somebody's phone but I have to trust that the film can carry that\\". The idea of sharing material online is also the subject of Thomson & Craighead's A Short Film About War (2009): the artists gathered photography from Flickr that was listed under a creative commons license. Comparably, in Demos' discussion with Balkin he observes how her work is often an investigation of ways of creating a space of the commons, through legal interventions or building a collective archive.

Early life Heather Penney majored in literature at Purdue University. Her father was retired Air Force Col. John Penney (born 1947), who served from 1970 to 1979 during the Vietnam War and joined United Airlines in 1979 and served until his retirement in 2007. Career Air National Guard Penney was the \\"only woman in her fighter pilot training class and the only woman in her fighter squadron\\" (121st Fighter Squadron) with the DC Air National Guard, stationed at Joint Base Andrews. September 11 attacks Maj. Penney, who was a first lieutenant at the time, was ordered into the air in her F-16 fighter jet alongside Marc H. Sasseville's aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base as the terrorist attacks were unfolding on September 11, 2001. They were ordered to down United Flight 93 before it reached Washington, D.C.'s airspace, but because of the urgency, there was not enough time to outfit their aircraft with live ammunition. The mission could only have been accomplished by ramming the plane with their respective fighter jets. Flight 93 subsequently crashed as the crew and passengers fought to take control of the aircraft. This ended the mission. When asked why she was ready to fly a kamikaze mission, Penney replied: > Why? Because there are things in this world that are more important than > ourselves. Freedom. The Constitution of the United States. Our way of life. > Mom, baseball, apple pie; these things and so many more that make us > uniquely American. We belong to something greater than ourselves.

Plot Henry Dodge is a 15-year-old boy haunted by the tragic death of his father during World War II. Henry discovers, after being coached by his grandmother, that the father of a classmate was the man who murdered his own father. After a violent row resulting in disciplinary action from a pacifist teacher, Mrs Beaumont, and spurred by classmate Grace, Henry begrudgingly makes peace with the boy, Paul Jeffries, who (along with his mother) is treated as a pariah due to the belief that the elder Jeffries was a deserter during the second world war. Whilst developing a photo taken of Grace during a group outing involving the three classmates, on a camera given to him by Mrs Beaumont, Henry spots a man who closely resembled the man he knew as his father, Joey. Upon seeing the photo his pregnant mother, Maureen, passes out with shock. Henry begins to develop distrust for his grandmother, as it is implied that she was the driving force behind the eviction of Paul and his mother. While honoring his father at the gravesite, the man who appeared in the photograph approaches Henry and the father and son are reunited. Henry tells his mother and she responds with disbelief and exasperation, accusing Henry of lying. Maureen falls to the ground while leaving the room and instructs Henry to fetch Bill from work. Later that night, Maureen chides Henry in her convalescence, pointing out that her new marriage would not be legal if the man he met were truly his father, that she would be guilty of the crime of bigamy and that the baby would be born a bastard. She instructs Henry to keep silent, but also to bring word to his father that she wishes to see him. The friendship between Grace and Henry begins to bloom into more romantic feelings with repeated trips to the cinema. Henry takes her to meet the man, who begins to show sinister motives. It is apparent upon Grace's intense questioning that Henry's father is a deserter who faked his own death, though he makes the claim that he was an amnesiac. Henry's devotion to the self-made cult of his father causes him to reject Grace and flee in anger. Joey approaches the house and borrows a match from an unwitting Bill, who is headed to his night job, and then enters the house and attempts to reclaim his rights as husband and father. Maureen points out that Bill has been paying the rent for five years and is more of a father to Henry. Meanwhile, Henry is totally supportive of his father in defiance of his mother. Henry's grandmother hears the noise and comes downstairs to investigate, declaring it a miracle when she sees her son, who immediately leaves on supposedly urgent business. The next morning, Henry's grandmother informs Bill over the breakfast table despite Maureen's protestations. Bill believes Maureen has hidden this information because she is ashamed that he is working class and poor. She assures him that this is not the case. Henry runs into his father on the street, who offers to take him under his wing in a nebulous, presumably nonexistent or illegal family business. Henry attempts to apologise to Grace, and Grace meets with Mrs Beaumont looking for advice on how to help Henry. The entire family gathers to hash things out with Joey. Joey threatens police action against Maureen and Bill. Only the grandmother stands in favor of Joey's return. Henry begins to have flashbacks to his early childhood, wherein his father was abusing his mother after throwing Henry out in the rain; he rejects Joey and runs off into the rain to drown himself at the beach, believing he must be evil if his father is evil, too. Bill convinces Henry to come home, telling him he could have the most precious thing in the world, his mother's love, if he would only take it. Henry meets with Grace where it is revealed to him that she and Mrs. Beaumont are working behind his back to discover the truth about his father. The police are involved and it is revealed the gifts that Henry's biological father had given him were stolen from a food depot in another town, and that they had been attempting to apprehend his father (under the pseudonym Walter Briggs) for some time for these and other crimes including stolen ration coupons. The police ask Maureen permission to exhume and examine the body in Joey's grave. It is revealed that the body is that of Ronald Jeffries, Paul's absentee father. Returning from a school pageant presented by Grace and Paul and Henry, wherein Henry reveals some of these heartfelt lessons, the family discovers that the house has been ransacked by Joey, who with blessings of the grandmother is stealing all of their possessions and furniture. Joey pistol- whips Bill and abducts Maureen and Henry, declaring his hatred for his mother by shoving her away as she offers to come along. Joey takes the pair to an abandoned warehouse where he has been in hiding, and takes their pictures with Mrs Beaumont's camera, hoping to have them made for passport photos to escape to Australia. He strikes Maureen again, wherein Henry reveals his newfound hatred for his father. Joey locks them in the warehouse basement with no food or heat, where Maureen begins to go into labor. Henry delivers the baby girl while the police attempt to locate Joey. Joey returns, and Henry hits him over the head with a large object, forcing him to reveal that he murdered Paul's father to fake his own death and desert as Ronald caught him looting, and assumed the new identity of Walter Briggs from some paperwork on the office table. The police arrive and kill Joey after he begins a shootout, and Henry holds his father as he dies. Ronald Jeffries is reburied with military honors, restoring his family's name, and Joey is dolefully buried as well. Grandmother Dodge attempts to move out of the house in shame and the family convinces her to stay and settle with her demons. Henry calls Bill \\"dad\\" for the first time as he is leaving the house to meet Grace, where it is revealed she is moving away temporarily for school and Henry has accepted an apprenticeship in a photography shop. They kiss in the theater they visited so frequently and the film ends.

History Engine house and cable winding machinery, Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company, 1898 The MTOC was started by Francis Boardman Clapp, who had come to Australia from the United States in 1853 to search for gold. In 1869 he set up the Melbourne Omnibus Company which ran horse-drawn trams in the inner suburbs of Melbourne. The company carried five million passengers. Clapp reorganised the horse tram company into the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company. By 1882 the company had over 1,600 horses and 178 omnibuses. In 1885 the company carried 11.7 million passengers. In 1885, the Government of Victoria offered MTOC a 30-year exclusive contract to operate a tram system using either horse, steam or cable power. Clapp chose to use the cable system which was being used successfully in both Chicago and San Francisco. The 12 councils which were in the area to be serviced by the MOTC formed the Melbourne Tramway Trust. The Trust laid the tracks, bought land and built the cable winding houses. The MOTC provided the trams and operated the service. From 1885 to 1891 service was established to covered the suburbs of Brunswick, Carlton, Collingwood, Clifton Hill, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, South Melbourne, West Melbourne, Port Melbourne, Prahran, Richmond, St.Kilda and Toorak. By 1887 with the new cable cars, the company carried 18 million passengers.

His film and TV career spanned from 1942 to 1977, and although mainly a character actor he is remembered for his part as Captain Greer in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) and for his reoccurring role as Ravenswood the butler in The Beverley Hillbillies. , He was sometimes credited as Arthur E. Gould-Porter and A. E. Gould-Porter. Biography Gould-Porter was born in Penzance, Cornwall, in 1905 to Archibald Gould-Porter and his wife, Mabel Amor. By the early 1930s Gould- Porter had moved to the United States and in 1931 he appeared at the Palm Beach Playhouse in A.A. Milne's Mr. Pim Passes By, to good reviews. In February 1932 he appeared at the Forrest Theatre on Broadway in the comedy play New York to Cherbourg. He returned to Broadway in 1935 to start an 18-month run at the Broadhurst Theatre in Laurence Housman's play Victoria Regina. Other Broadway appearances included Bachelor Born (1938-39) and Oscar Wilde (1938-39). By 1942 Gould-Porter was branching into film roles, with uncredited roles in Eagle Squadron, The Black Swan and Random Harvest. He also received his first credited role in 1942 when he appeared as Freddie in the American thriller Nightmare. Gould-Porter continued to find work throughout the 1940s, appearing in minor parts in a string of Hollywood films, including roles in Jane Eyre (1943), National Velvet (1944) and A Double Life (1947). He took a break from film in 1948 and returned to the stage, appearing at the Booth Theatre in Keith Winter's The Rats of Norway. The play lasted just three days before closing, and in 1951 he was again finding roles in film, appearing as a chauffeur in Kind Lady. In 1952 Gould-Porter made his first appearance on television, appearing in an episode of the American detective series Saber of London. He followed this with further small film parts before landing his largest role to date in the comedy The Girls of Pleasure Island. Despite this larger role, it did not lead to greater success, but work continued to follow with an appearance in the Tony Curtis-led biopic Houdini (1953) and a part as the bartender in Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1953). More television work followed, and between 1955 and 1957 Gould-Porter appeared in The Colgate Comedy Hour, The 20th Century-Fox Hour, Topper, Lux Video Theatre and The Joseph Cotten Show. From 1955 Gould-Porter began appearing in more notable film roles, included credited parts in Lady Godiva of Coventry (1955) and Top Secret Affair (1957). Although now appearing as a credited film actor, he instead found himself being drawn to more television work, and between 1956 and 1960 he starred in eight episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. He followed this with more small-screen outings in Adventures in Paradise, One Step Beyond, Sea Hunt and The Rogues, amongst others. Of all the television shows he appeared in during the 1960s, he only appeared once as a recurring character, that of Ravenswood the butler in the comedy series Beverley Hillbillies, appearing in eight episodes between 1962 and 1966. In 1966 Gould- Porter made an appearance in an actual Alfred Hitchcock movie, taking the role of Freddy the Bookseller in Torn Curtain. This was followed with a bit part in Richard Fleisher's 1967 British musical film Doctor Dolittle, but he did not return to acting until 1970, when he made an appearance in another musical, Darling Lili. One of his final movie credits was as Captain Greer in the Disney musical Bedknobs and Broomsticks. His final television role came in 1977, when he played Winston Churchill in Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years. He retired to Los Angeles, where he died in 1987. He was never married.

He is best known for his successful career as an ultramarathon runner and his indistinct fast speech. Mahmut Yavuz was born in 1982. At the age of 14, he entered the Naval High School on the island Heybeliada in Istanbul. After finishing the high school, he attended the Naval Academy in Tuzla, Istanbul. He graduated with a BSc degree in computer engineering. He was commissioned as an officer of the SAT Commando (Underwater Attack) at the Turkish Navy Marines and Special Forces, a similar unit to the Underwater Demolition Team of the United States Navy SEALs. As of November 2013, Yavuz has the rank of a navy lieutenant (), and is stationed in Keçilik village at Anadolu Kavağı, Beykoz, Istanbul. Sports career Mahmut Yavuz used to perform running sport already during the high school and academy years participating at competitions. Following his graduation from the naval academy, he began to run half marathons and marathons. In later years, Yavuz got interested in ultra running. In 2012, he debuted in ultramarathon running as he took part at the İznik Ultramarathon. In order to be prepared for the ultramarathons, he trains around within the week. Due to his strict duty times, he participates at the single-stage competitions on weekends, and at multiday races only during his vacation. He lately ran at ultramarathons with extreme conditions in Turkey, China and Republic of South Africa. Mahmut Yavuz admits that the training in terms of physical and psychological endurance he received during the SAT commando courses is an absolutely significant advantage at this type competitions. Yavuz won the 2012 İznik Ultramarathon over , and repeated his success by winning the first edition of the six-day Runfire Cappadocia Ultramarathon the same year. After coming first at the 2013 İznik Ultramarathon again, he became runner-up at the seven-day lasting and long Gobi March in China, the second event of the 4 Deserts series. Yavuz won the DASK Anatolian Mountain Marathon held at Mount Bolu on July 5–6, 2013 together with his teammate İlyas Avcı.

It is a monotypic genus, the only species being A. ligustrina, and is assigned to the showy mistletoe family, Loranthaceae. It is sometimes called Louisa's mistletoe.  Description  Atkinsonia ligustrina is a stout upright evergreen shrub of 1–2 m high, that parasitises on the roots of other woody plants, but photosynthesises for itself. It has twenty four chromosomes (2n=24).  Roots  The primary roots are long-lived, fleshy, bear many scars, and turn blue when damaged. Secondary roots bearing the taproots (or haustoria) are short-lived and devoid of root hairs.  Stems and branches  There are numerous red–brown branches that split into smooth branchlets that break easily.  Leaves  The leaves are oppositely set along the branches, but sometimes apparently randomly positioned if some leaves have fallen, are slightly fleshy, spread out, initially bright green and later somewhat more dull green 2–5 cm long, ½–1 cm wide, the downward facing surface felty, an entire margin that has an identical curve from the tapering foot, that ends in an approximately 2 mm long leaf stalk, and a blunt tip at the other side.  Flowers  The up to eight sweetly scented flowers in each inflorescence are set in racemes in the axils of the leaves, and are almost the same length as the leaves themselves, and appear in November. Each flower has a short stalk, and is subtended by a pair of bracteoles close to the flower, and a third bract further down. The mostly six (sometimes up to eight) petals are spreading narrow strips of approximately 7 mm long, yellow in color, later becoming more rusty red. The anthers are short, pale yellow, and are merged to the petal at the foot.  Fruits  The drupe-like oval to egg-shaped fruit of about 1½ cm long, is initially green, but develops a red skin when ripe in about March. It hides a thin sticky layer around the seed. The fruits are eaten or shed before the following season's flowerbuds occur.  Taxonomy  Allan Cunningham discovered this species in 1817 and called it Nuytsia ligustrina. This name was published by Lindley in 1839, but not accompanied by the required description. Ferdinand von Mueller described the plant in 1861, thus finally providing the plant with a name. When he was able to see the fruits, he decided the species should be in a new genus, Atkinsonia, and he made the new combination Atkinsonia ligustrina in 1865. Later, in 1883, G. Bentham and J.D. Hooker assigned A. ligustrina to Loranthus, but since Loranthus ligustrina (now Helixanthera ligustrina) had already been used by Nathaniel Wallich in 1824 for another species from India, a new combination, Loranthus atkinsonae, was created. Adolf Engler first included this species in Gaiadendron in 1894, to subsequently distinguish the subgenera Atkinsonia and Eugaiadendron in 1897 based on the morphology of the inflorescences, and eventually in cooperation with Ernst Hans Ludwig Krause restoring both genera to their original circumscription in 1939.  Etymology  The genus, Atkinsonia, was named for Louisa Atkinson, a plant collector, who found many new plants in the Blue Mountains, including the specimen of A. ligustrina that Cunningham based his description on. The specific epithet, ligustrina, derives from \\"Ligustrum\\", a genus in the family Oleaceae, and the Latin, \\"-ina\\", a suffix indicating resemblance. Thus the epithet means resembling Ligustrum.Plantillustrations.ord: ligustrinus, -a, -um. Retrieved 11 September 2019.  Distribution  Louisa's mistletoe is confined to a small area in the Blue Mountains inland from Sydney, approximately between Linden, Mount Wilson and Mount Victoria, and around Marrangaroo.  Habitat  The species occurs in woodland and heathland growing in exposed sites, and on rocky ridges.  Ecology  A specimen can often be simultaneously parasitic on the roots of many nearby plants. Taproots have been found connecting with the root system of Acacia intertexta, a Caustis species, Dillwynia ericifolia, Eucalyptus piperita, Leptospermum attenuatum, Monotoca scoparia and Platysace linearifolia. A. ligustrina's small, open, perfumed flowers are insect- pollinated, and the drupe-like fruit has a thin sticky layer on the seed. Seedlings can grow substantially without making contact with a host.

Dr. El Ghanem then claims he was menaced to remove the harassment charges he had filed. The harassment continued repeatedly and without pause. Dr. El Ghanem alleged that informants were being used in the harassment, most of them migrants. In 2003, Dr. El Ghanem called journalist Robert Fisk in Beirut and told him of the threats and harassment he'd received from the Swiss secret services.Robert Fisk’s World: The curious case of the missing Egyptian and the Swiss police, The Independent, 29 August 2009Jailed in Geneva: The Colonel Who Stood up to Mubarek but Refused to Spy for the Swiss, Robert Fisk, the Independent, March 5, 2012 Robert Fisk knew Dr. El Ghanem from Egypt; had previously written articles about his Egyptian government persecution.

Plot  John Solomon, a documentary filmmaker, recruits Grace Lee to investigate the zombie subculture of Los Angeles. Solomon is convinced that the zombies are dangerous and wishes to expose them, but Lee takes a more sympathetic view. Zombies are divided into three different categories: the feral, Romero-style zombies that exhibit no sentience; low-functioning zombies that can work simple menial jobs, such as sweatshops; and high-functioning zombies that do not retain their memories or personality but can pass as human. At first open and welcoming, the zombies become evasive and warn the documentary crew away from a private ceremony at an upcoming zombie festival. There, the crew discovers that the rumors of cannibalism are not simply an ignorant cultural stereotype.  Cast  * Grace Lee as a fictional version of herself * John Solomon as a fictional version of himself * Austin Basis as Ivan * Suzy Nakamura as Judy * Al Vicente as Joel * Jane Edith Wilson as Lisa * Andrew Amondson as himself * Amy D. Higgins as Dr. Gloria Reynolds * Vanessa Peters as Monique  Production  The film was inspired by director Grace Lee's previous documentary work and the violent dreams that one of Lee's friends had been having. Lee wanted to make a satire about documentary filmmaking, identity politics, and life in Los Angeles.  Release  American Zombie premiered at Slamdance Film Festival on January 18, 2007. It also screened at SXSW and Sitges Film Festival. On March 28, 2008, it got a limited theatrical release. To publicize the release, Lee and members of the cast recreated artistic elements of the show, including a zombie art showing and zines. It was released on DVD on July 8, 2008. American Zombie is the first English-language film distributed by iHQ.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 72% of 18 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.5/10. Bloody Disgusting rated the film 2.5/5 stars and said that the climax invalidates the biting satire that comes before it. Dennis Harvey of Variety called the film mildly amusing and tepid compared to much better zombie spoofs, which he said are played out. Steve Barton of Dread Central rated the film 3.5/5 stars and said the film \\"will keep you laughing and also send the shivers. It's one of the most unique living dead experiences you're likely to have for some time to come.\\" However, Barton criticized the ending as \\"a very flaccid exclamation point on an otherwise ambitious experience.\\" Tom Becker of DVD Verdict wrote that it is \\"a funny and original faux documentary that works as a social satire as well as a send up of the horror subgenre made famous by George Romero.\\" Heather Seebach of Shock Till You Drop wrote that it \\"provides a clever idea with elements of social commentary and self-parody.\\" J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader said that while almost nothing in the film is original, Lee \\"smoothly steers the narrative from farce to suspense.\\" In a mixed review, Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter said that \\"the satire is highly uneven, and the whole enterprise is a bit too drawn out to retain its irreverent momentum.\\" Academic Peter Dendle called the film a \\"discerning, carefully thought out contribution to the genre\\" that \\"is never reducible to a preachy, thinly veiled metaphor\\". Author Eric Hamako wrote that the film \\"portrays conservative rhetoric that the Other does not deserve civil rights and will only use those rights to further their attempts to destroy society.\\"  References   External links  2007 films 2007 horror films 2007 independent films American films American independent films American zombie films American mockumentary films American satirical films English-language films Films directed by Grace Lee ","title":"American Zombie"},{"id":"41230590","text":"Senticaudata is one of the four suborders of the crustacean order Amphipoda (aka scuds, sideswimmers).

The game was crowdfunded on Kickstarter, and was released in 2015.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot Dex is a 2D side-scrolling platform game focused on exploration and non-linear gameplay, more like a Role-playing game. The player controls the eponymous character, Dex, and receives quests from NPCs. Every quest has multiple possible solutions and it is up to player which of them to choose. The player receives experience points for every quest completed or enemy killed. Experience points grant skill points that can be invested into the character's skills. Skills include fighting, shooting, hacking, and lock-picking. Plot The story follows Dex, a young woman living in Harbor Prime. Harbor Prime is a city controlled by corporations that are integrated into a secret authority known as the Complex. Dex becomes a target of the Complex that sends its assassins to her. Dex is saved by a hacker known as Raycast who guides her to safety. Raycast reveals that Dex is the \\"fragment of Kether.\\" Kether was the supreme Artificial Intelligence program created by the Complex. It was shut down when the Complex lost control of it. Dex becomes part of resistance against the Complex.  Development and release The game was announced at the Game Developers Session 2012 and originally scheduled to be released in 2013. In late 2012, developers started a Kickstarter campaign, which started on November 12 when the studio asked for £14,000. The amount was reached a week later and in the end the game was pledged £30,647. On November 4, 2012, Dex was greenlit for Steam. The first build of Alpha version was released an Early Access on August 14, 2014. It featured a limited amount of quests and locations. The second build was released three months later, featuring more quests, locations and characters. The Beta was released on April 1, 2015, adding almost all features intended for the final release, including the story, and was published only in Steam Beta Build. The final version was released on May 7, 2015. A physical version produced by publishers PQube and BadLand Games for the PlayStation 4 console was released on July 29. Reception Dex received mixed reviews upon its release. Arcade Sushi praised the gameplay system which \\"combines expressive 2D sprites and nostalgic platforming with some grade-A, modern action-RPG.\\" It also praised the story and its familiarity to Deus Ex and Shadowrun. On the other hand, the save system was criticised as was the journal system. The review also mentioned some minor bug, but was overall positive and called Dex a \\"solid game worth investment.\\" Czech website Zing praised the atmosphere of the game world and the story along with the soundtrack. Side-quests that include possibility to make a decision also gained praise. However, it criticised the number of bugs and noted that Dex should have stayed in Early Access for a bit longer. Dex won the Czech Game of the Year Award for artistic contribution to Czech video game output in 2014. Website Games.cz voted Dex the best Czech video game developed in 2015. They noted that the game would not have been nominated for the title at release due to the high number of bugs that spoiled the experience, but Dreadlocks had released multiple bug- fixing and game-improving updates since then. The review noted that after these updates Dex \\"is the undisputed best title\\" among Czech games of 2015. The console version has received more positive reviews than PC version. It holds 69% on Metacritic. Elias Blondeau of CGMagazine praised the story and gameplay. He called Dex \\"the absolute best Ghost in the Shell game we’ve ever gotten.\\" Digitally Downloaded compared Dex with The Technomancer. It praised Dex for its gameplay but criticised narrative. Lauren Relph praised the art design and the inspiration from various cyberpunk sources such as Blade Runner. Another praise was for story and well-acted characters. Relph on the other hand criticised combat mechanic and hacking. Relph concluded her review: \\"A modest and enjoyable game, with a selection of great characters, and a storyline often giving pause for thought. Dex is a solid project, clearly put together with love. While its combat mechanic and hacking are lacking, the majority of the experience is deep and interesting.\\" ZTGD published a negative review which criticised combat, story and controls. He also noted performance issues with the Xbox One version. His conclusion was: \\"Dex just never stood out enough for me. The generic and clichéd story left me cold, and the technical issues made the game hard to like. However, it is worth noting that the various performance issues I encountered on the Xbox One were not present on the PC version. So if you feel like you need to check Dex out and have the ability to do so, get it on PC. It doesn’t differ much in general, but at least it will be slightly more pleasant to play.\\" Brandon Marlow has written another negative review. He praised game's world and story, noting interesting characters and places; but he criticised, on the other hand, its gameplay which he called a \\"dull affair.\\" References External links *Official website 2015 video games Action role-playing video games Crowdfunded video games Cyberpunk video games Hacking video games Indie video games Kickstarter- funded video games Linux games Open world video games MacOS games Ouya games Platform games PlayStation 4 games PlayStation Network games PlayStation Vita games Science fiction video games Side-scrolling role-playing video games Single-player video games Steam Greenlight games Unity (game engine) games Video games developed in the Czech Republic Video games featuring female protagonists Video games with alternate endings Windows games Xbox One games Early access video games ","title":"Dex (video game)"},{"id":"41230620","text":"Koz cham Dherai koz cham is a part of Dherai village in Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan.

He was one of Malik's best known companions and had a tremendous influence in spreading the Maliki school in Egypt and the Maghreb. Life He was born at Old Cairo in Dhu al-Qi‘dah in the year 125 AH (743 CE). He was a member, by adoption, of the tribe of Quraysh: a native of Egypt, was a mawla to Rehana, who was herself a mawla to Abu Abd ArRahman Yazid Ibn Unais, of the tribe of Fihr. He received his early training in the Islamic sciences under the tutelage of the Egyptian scholar Uthman ibn Abd al- Hakam al-Judhami (d. 779), and travelled thereupon to Medina to study with Malik ibn Anas. He stayed with Malik for about twenty years, and disseminated his fiqh in Egypt. He studied not only with Malik but also with many of the companions of Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri. Ibn Wahb took from more than four hundred shaykhs of hadith in Egypt, the Hijaz and Iraq, including Sufyan al-Thawri, Ibn 'Uyaynah, Ibn Jurayj, 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Ziyad al-Ifriqi, Sa'id ibn Abi Ayyub and others. Many also related hadiths from him. Ibn Wahb has a high standing in the Maliki school as he was one of Malik's first and most prominent companions. Al-Asbagh, one of the students of Malik's companions said of him, \\"Ibn Wahb was the companion of Malik with the most knowledge of the Sunnah and traditions although he related from men who were weak\\". Ibn Wahb himself recognised that some of his hadiths were weak. He said, \\"if it had not been that Allah rescued me through Malik and al-Layth, I would have been lost. I knew many hadiths, and that confused me. I used to present them to Malik and al-Layth and they would say, 'Take this and leave that'\\". Malik esteemed and loved Ibn Wahb. He did not spare any of his companions criticism except for Ibn Wahb. Malik used to call him \\"the faqih\\" when he wrote to him. Ibn Wahb was one of those who spread Malik's school in Egypt and the Maghreb. People travelled to him to learn Malik's fiqh both during Malik's lifetime and after his death. He left many excellent books, including what he heard from Malik which took up about 30 volumes. He died on 24th of Sha‘ban in the year 197 AH (813 CE).

Through his career in the tea import business he invented and patented a number of industrial machines and developed the earliest air conditioning systems. He founded the Sirocco Works in Belfast in 1881. Early life Davidson was born in County Down on 18 November 1846, the youngest child of a family of Ulster Scots. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution (the \\"Inst\\") and left at the age of 15 to work at a Belfast civil engineering firm, William Hastings. As a teenager he gained experience as an apprentice to a surveyor in Belfast, and visited his uncle John Davidson's flax mill in Drumaness, probably the first in Ulster to be equipped with power machinery. He also became familiar with John's experimental approach using scientific methods to increase crop yields in flax farming for the linen industry. These early experiences gave Sam a lifelong appreciation for learning through personal hands-on experience, and innovation in commercial agriculture and engineering. Career Samuel Cleland Davidson with a huge centrifugal fan he designed and manufactured, probably for ventillating a mine shaft. Sirocco Engineering Works, Belfast. Hand painted illustration from an illuminated coming of age book presented to Samuel's son James on his 21st birthday. The Sirocco Works on the River Lagan, Belfast, during demolition in 2009 In 1864 he left his job to work for his father, James Davidson who owned a flour mill close to the site of the later Sirocco works. The Indian government had discovered wild tea growing in the Assam region and was determined to initiate a massive tea-growing operation there with the potential to generate huge wealth for the British Empire as it consolidated its hold on the economy of India. The opportunity to have its own tea industry and become less dependent on importing the Empire's favourite drink from China was too important to ignore. Initially the government paid for and organised clearing the forest and the planting and management of tea 'gardens', as the large plantations were called. Once they were established they were sold to private investors to consolidate and expand, and develop a commercially viable industry. Samuel's father and uncle set up a business importing tea and bought a share in a tea estate in Cachar, 300 miles north- east of Calcutta in India. Samuel's cousin James went to India to personally manage the estate and later invited 17-year-old Samuel and some other local young men to join him. Samuel Davidson quickly gained a reputation as a hard working, trustworthy and successful estate manager. He applied his agricultural and engineering knowledge to significantly improve crop yields, and to begin mechanising every stage of the archaic and very labour-intensive processes involved in turning plucked tea leaves into a marketable product of consistent quality. As a person who had not pursued higher education at home, Samuel's innovations mainly came about through persistent experimentation, and his greatest successes were sometimes counter-intuitive to the assumptions of engineers at the time. Not knowing that what he was trying to achieve with centrifugal fans was considered impossible by more educated mechanical engineers turned out to be a great blessing. When he later travelled to America to prove to sceptical patent authorities that his design actually worked he said \\"An ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory.\\" ('The Sirocco Story: Birth and growth of an industry' by Edward Maguire 1958) He sold the property in India in 1874 and returned to Ireland where he began to manufacture his patented tea machinery with Combe, Barbour and Coombe of Belfast. After a year of manufacturing the first versions of his tea machinery in Belfast, Samuel returned to India in 1878 and toured the major centres of tea production with a portable tea factory which he set up in each remote location to demonstrate to the planters what his products could achieve. The orders started to flood in and his machines became the standard for the whole industry over the following years. His expertise in every aspect of the industry was so respected that tea companies paid him to spend time in each area he took his factory to making assessments of the local estates and recommendations for how they could best raise their productivity. He also paid for the trip by selling hundreds if another invention of his – a simple wheeled hoe which the planters loved. In 1881 he started his own manufacturing operation in Belfast. The success of his innovative use of stoves to move hot air led him to develop a convection heating system for use in human environments, and by the end of the 1880s his Sirocco stoves were in popular use in schools, church halls and workrooms. He developed his invention further with the introduction in 1898 of a forward-bladed centrifugal fan, which was significantly more powerful than conventional fan designs. This innovation, originally designed for drying tea, evolved into the first air conditioning system. The powerful force of moving hot air across a room with one of his centrifugal fans led one of Davidson's planter colleagues to remark that it reminded him of the Sirocco, the hot wind that blows across the North African desert, and Davidson adopted Sirocco as his brand name, applying it to his products and to the firm's Belfast factory, the Sirocco Engineering Works. Davidson & Co grew into one of the largest engineering firms in Ireland, manufacturing and exporting equipment for cooling, drying, dust collecting, heating, ventilating, pneumatic conveyance, and mechanical handling, all invented by Davidson himself. He supplied ventillation fans for the Titanic which was built practically next door to the Sirocco works at the Harland and Wolff shipyard, and have been photographed on the wreck. During World War I the Sirocco works supplied the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy. When the German fleet was scuttled at Scapa Flow in 1919, it was discovered that nearly every German ship was equipped with Sirocco fans manufactured before the war. Desperate to use his inventing skills to aid the war effort in World War 1, he designed and made prototypes of a hand-held grenade-launching pistol or 'Hand Howitzer' for use in the trenches where his son Jim was fighting as a machine gun captain. The American military were close to placing a big order for these when the war ended. Samuel was always aware of the diverse applications of the technology he invented and newspapers of the late 1800s and early 1900s featured adverts for Sirocco products ranging from lawn tennis net poles to ventillation machinery for mining operations. He invented and marketed a sparkling tea drink, and was close friends with John Dunlop as they were both experimenting with the vulcanisation of rubber, another imperial cash crop with huge potential for the British economy. Samuel was a very effective strategist – he could think ahead, see the big picture and take bold steps to change the circumstances for his businesses if necessary. An example of this was the retail price of tea. It was still very expensive in the late Victorian era and he realised that if the Indian tea estates and his machinery were to make a profit in the long term the retail price would have to come down significantly and become affordable for the whole population. To fix this he set up the Sirocco Bonded Tea Store, imported and sold tea at a far lower price than usual that forced the larger tea companies to cut their prices too, then closed that company once it had achieved its goal. He brought the retail price of tea in Belfast down from 5 shillings to 2 shillings per pound. Throughout the political tensions and upheavals in Northern Ireland Samuel was a keen Unionist who believed strongly that Irish businesses like his were safer in the British Empire than out of it, and he was a staunch supporter of Edward Carson and the original Ulster Volunteer Force opposing home rule for Ireland. However, he never indulged in sectarian bigotry and employed Protestants and Catholics alike at the Sirocco Works. When anti-Catholic gangsters demanded that he sack his Catholic employees Samuel refused and posted armed guards at the works to protect them until the threats subsided. When his son and heir James, who had been groomed to inherit the company, was killed at the Somme Samuel's health began to decline and his son in law Frederick Maguire who was already a senior manager led the company through the next generation. In 1988, the Davidson Group was acquired by the fan and heat exchanger firm James Howden & Co (established 1854 by the Scottish engineer James Howden) to form Howden Sirocco Limited, today known as Howden UK. Davidson's Sirocco Works were eventually vacated and in 2009 the property was demolished as part of the redevelopment of the Belfast Waterfront. The name of Davidson's former factory continues today in the Sirocco Works Football Club, a team formed in 1924 by works employees which continues to play today in the Northern Amateur Football League.

Clara married one of her father's employees, Frederick George Maguire, in 1903. James worked as general manager in his father's business and patented several of his own mechanical engineering developments. He toured the world in 1911 making business deals in Russia, Japan and America, and was expected to eventually take over from his father. He served as a volunteer with the 1st Battalion North Down Regiment of the Ulster Volunteer Force and during World War I he became a captain in the 13th Royal Irish Rifles. James was shot dead by a German sniper on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, aged 39, while being carried back to the British trenches after fighting hard all day and being shot in the knee. Later life and death Samuel Cleland Davidson portrait photo. Samuel Cleland Davidson became a Member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1888, and in 1921 he was knighted by King George V although too ill to make the journey to London for the ceremonials. A few months later Davidson died on 18 August 1921 in Seacourt, Bangor, County Down. He was buried alongside his wife, Clara Mary, in Belfast City Cemetery. Davidson's contribution to engineering in Ireland was commemorated by the Northern Bank in its Inventor series of banknotes celebrating Northern Irish inventors. Sir Samuel featured with tea plants and some of his machinery on the bank's £50 note. Three design versions of this series were issued over the years, the second being hastily replaced by the third after a major bank robbery by the IRA. The note was discontinued in 2013 when the bank reissued its banknotes under the new Danske Bank brand.

C. Simmons, standing at rear, and Mr. C. G. Ludford, on the left. The history of veterinary medicine in the Philippines discusses the history of veterinary medicine as a profession in the Philippines. Its history in the Philippines began in 1828, while the Philippines was still a colony of Spain, progressing further during the time when the Philippines became a territory of the United States, until the establishment of the Philippines as an independent Republic in the modern- day era. Spanish era (1521–1898) Although there was a Spanish Royal Decree that was issued on May 31, 1828 assigning that there should be one veterinarian for the Philippine islands (a number later increased to two veterinarians in 1843), the highlight of the history of veterinary medicine in the Philippines was in 1888, when the need to investigate the occurrence of the Rinderpest epizootic (cattle plague) in the Philippine islands emerged. The cattle plague that affected the cow and carabao (water buffalo) population between Manila and Bulacan were caused by sick animals that were imported from Indochina and Hong Kong. The Commission assigned to perform the investigation was appointed by Don Benigno Quiroga y Ballesteros, the Director General of the Administraction Civil de Filipinas (Civil Administration of the Philippines) during that time. The Commission was composed of an army veterinarian, a pharmacist, and a medical doctor. The army veterinarian and head of the Commission was Don Gines Geis y Gotzens. The pharmacist was Don Anacleto del Rosario y Sales, who at the time was the Director of the Laboratorio Municipal de Manila (Municipal Laboratory of Manila). The physician was Don Francisco Masip, an official in-charge of public health. The 1888 cattle plague (also known as steppe murrain) prompted the need for the services of veterinarians in the Philippines, including those from the ranks (commissioned officers) of the Spanish Army. The effects of the plague lasted from 1888 through 1939, meaning it moved on from Spanish period up to the American period in the history of the Philippines. From 1901 to 1902 alone, more than 600,000 cattle and water buffaloes were killed by the disease. American era (1898–1946) Veterinary functions American occupation of the Philippines began in 1898. During the American period in Philippine history (1898-1946), the American government established the a veterinary department in 1899, a part of the Board of Health, the office that was in- charge of public health and safety. The government of the United States sent groups of American veterinary doctors to the Philippines to function as inspectors of cattle imported through Manila, as inspectors of both locally butchered and imported beef, as caretakers of the health of animals owned by the government (including the horses of American soldiers), and as sanitary inspectors of public and private stables. In 1899, 60 civilian American veterinarians were working hand-in-hand with the United States Army's Veterinary Corps. In 1905, the veterinary department was placed under the management of the Bureau of Agriculture (known at present as the Bureau of Animal Industry). Philippine Veterinary Medical Association On September 7, 1907, the Philippine Veterinary Medical Association (PVMA) was established by a group composed of veterinarians from the US Army and veterinarians from the Insular Government. At the time, the acting Chief Veterinarian was Dr. C.M. Richards, and the chief of the Animal Husbandry Division was Dr. Frank C. Gearhart. First veterinary school In 1908, the College of Veterinary Science of the University of the Philippines was founded. On September 1, 1910, Dr. George E. Nesom, the first president of the Philippine Veterinary Medical Association (PVMA) and who was also the first Director of the Bureau of Agriculture was appointed as the chairman of the Committee on Forage and Committee on Beef, a committee that was a component of the Board of Officers of the Civil Government of the Philippines and the United States Army. The UP College of Veterinary Science (later became known as the UP College of Veterinary Medicine) started to offer classes in 1910. Its first dean was Archibald Ward, an American veterinarian licensed to practice in the Philippines. Two other Americans after Ward became deans of the college. The college was first housed in Pandacan, Manila, which was later transferred to the Barlett Building built in Diliman, Quezon City (the Barlett Building was named after Murray Barlett, the first president of the University of the Philippines), before the college was moved to its current location in Los Baños, Laguna. The Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) stayed in Diliman, Quezon City. From 1910 to 1960, the UP College of Veterinary Science was the only school of veterinary medicine in the Philippines. Between 1910 and 1960, the college produced 450 veterinarians. Among them was Dr. Teodulio Topacio, Sr. Topacio, Sr. was one of the first four Filipinos to enroll in and graduated from the UP College of Veterinary Science. Curriculum The curriculum of the college for the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) course started as a five-year education program. It became a four-year course in 1920. It became a six-year course in 1926 due to the combination of two degrees, namely the Bachelor of Science in Agriculture and the degree in Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. In 1960, the BS degree in Agriculture was removed but the course remained as a six-year program. The first two years of the 1960 program was pre-veterinary education involving studies of the liberal arts and the natural sciences, followed by a four-year intensive veterinary training studies. Veterinary regulation board As of February 11, 1913, the practice of veterinary medicine in the Philippines was being regulated by Public Act No. 2245, and resulted in the creation of the Veterinary Examining Board. The Veterinary Examining Board begun to function on November 4, 1913. The board was composed of appointees chosen by the Governor-General and was supervised administratively by the Director of Agriculture. The board was later managed by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce because of Public Act No. 4007, transferring the authority to appoint board members to its Department Secretary. Pioneer veterinarians By 1914, apart from the first graduates of the UP College of Veterinary Science which included Dr. Teodulio Topacio, Sr., other Filipinos started to become active in the field of veterinary medicine in the Philippines. Some of them graduated from schools of medicine in the United States, such as Dr. Victor A. Buencamino (a graduate from the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, 1911), Dr. Vicente G. Ferriols (a graduate from the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, 1912), Dr. Ventura T. Gatchalian, and Dr. Sixto N. Almeda Carlos (a graduate from The San Francisco Veterinary College, 1916). A Spaniard veterinarian residing in the Philippines, Mariano Juan Francisco Muñoz y Tomen, was also active in the Philippines in 1914. Some Filipino veterinarians stayed in the Philippines to practice their profession. Others migrated to the United States, Australia, and other countries that has a demand for their services. Military veterinarians In 1916, the veterinarian members of the Veterinary Corps of the US Army assigned to the Philippines were given military ranks (they previously did not have ranks in the US Army) and thus became commissioned military officers through the efforts of Dr. William Proctor Hill, the president of PVMA from 1910 to 1911. Dr. Hill, a graduate from the Ontario Veterinary College in Canada, was an advocate for the \\"regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine and surgery\\" in the Philippines. Filipino veterinary officials From 1907 to 1917, the PVMA were managed by American officials only. In 1918, two Filipinos (Dr. Victor A. Buencamino as vice-president and Dr. Sixto N. Almeda Carlos as treasure) became officers of the PVMA. In 1919, all officers of the PVMA were Filipinos: Dr. Victor A. Buencamino became the PVMA president while Dr. Vicente G. Ferriols became the vice-president; the two other Filipino PVMA officers elected were Dr. Angel K. Gomez (as secretary) and Dr. Santiago B. Montemayor (as treasurer). Independent Philippine-Republics era (1946-present) Other veterinary schools The Philippines became an independent nation on July 4, 1946. In the 1970s, there were already three veterinary schools in the Philippines. Apart from the first College of Veterinary Science that was established by the University of the Philippines in 1908, the other two were the veterinary colleges of the University of Eastern Philippines and of the Araneta University. Regulation and ethics During the years of the Fifth Philippine Republic (1986–present), the regulatory law called Public Act No. 2245 of 1913 was replaced by Philippine Republic Act No. 3892 on February 23, 1992. RA No. 3892 had also become known as the An Act to Regulate the Practice of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery in the Philippines. The Philippine Veterinary Medical Association that was founded in 1907 became an incorporation and became known as Philippine Veterinary Medical Association, Inc. On February 23, 1992 when the PVMA, Inc. ratified the Code of Ethics that should be followed by veterinary medicine professionals in the Philippines. The first members of the Philippine veterinary medicine Board of Ethics were Dr. Santiago Y. Rotea, Dr. Faustino Turla, and Dr. Anacleto B. Coronel, with Dr. Rotea functioning as chairman of the board. Veterinary organizations Several chapters of PVMA, Inc. had been established as the profession of veterinary medicine progressed during the period of modern-day Philippines. There had been a number of veterinary associations that become affiliates to PVMA, Inc. The first association to be affiliated to PVMA, Inc. was the Cebu Veterinary Medical Society, founded in November 1963 and was then headed by Dr. Nestor R. Alonzo as its president while seconded by Dr. Rosalio C. Mandin as vice-president. From 1974 onward, there had been other independent veterinary organizations that affiliated themselves with PVMA, Inc. Among them were the City Veterinarians League (CVL, established in 1975), the Veterinary Practitioners Association of the Philippines (VPAP, established in 1972, formerly known as the Veterinary Private Practitioners Association when it was founded by private veterinary medicine practitioners), the Veterinary Women's League (VWL, established in 1973, which later became known as the Philippine Veterinary Women's Association, PVWA), the Philippine Animal Hospital Association (PAHA, established in 1978) and the Philippine Society of Veterinary Diagnosticians (PSVD, registered with PVMA, Inc. in 1981), the Veterinary Quarantine Officers of the Philippines (VQOP, established in 1986), and the Davao Veterinary Private Practitioners Association (DVPPA, established in 1984).

The Finnish institute for local languages, 7 January 2013. Accessed on 23 February 2013. The system is intended to provide affordable owned apartments to Helsinkians. Apartments within the Hitas system are set a maximum selling price already when the lot is signed over for construction, and this maximum selling price may not be exceeded even when selling the apartment afterwards. The system includes approximately 18 thousand apartments, all of them in Helsinki. Hitas regulated apartments are generally a little less expensive than those on the free market, depending on the location and date of building. All Hitas apartments are situated on lots rented from the city. Formation of the maximum selling price The current market index was taken into use on 1 March 2004. Before this, the Hitas maximum price was calculated by a specific Hitas price index. However, the index change had a negative effect on the price of apartments built from 1988 to 1990, and so a complaint was made about this to the city council and the legal warden of the Parliament of Finland. The city council decided on 29 March 2005 to extend the use of the old Hitas index parallel to the market index longer than originally planned, and make changes to the calculations according to voiced complaints. Exceeding the maximum selling price can result in compulsory purchase of the apartment, to the loss of the buyer. Such action is taken a couple of times per year. The owner of a Hitas apartment is entitled to sell furniture at a decent price, but the price of the furniture may not exceed its real value. Also renovations and improvements to the apartment, such as a glassed terrace, might increase the Hitas price. The owner must provide a written record of the improvements. Repairs to the apartment can also increase the Hitas price. According to the new price index, the value of the repairs must be at least 100 € per square metre for them to have an effect on the price. Any possible corporate loan left over is deducted from the maximum selling price, if it has not been paid yet for the apartment. The seller of the apartment must provide a premade and confirmed calculation of the Hitas maximum selling price to the buyer on demand. Queueing for Hitas apartments The selling of the Hitas apartments has been criticised as old-fashioned. In April 2010, the city of Helsinki sold one hundred new apartments in three corporations in Hermanni for about 3000 € per square metre, 400 € below the average price of old apartments in the neighbourhood. The apartments were only available for sale in the housing cooperative premises in Pasila, in a queueing order of buyers having come to the premises. Some people even spent several days in front of the premises queuing for new apartments.\\"Jonossa tienaa tonnin tunnissa\\", Helsingin Sanomat 11 April 2010, p. A14.Ostajat jonottavat jo asuntoja, Taloussanomat 9 April 2010. This was the last new Hitas building where buyers queued in front of the premises in Pasila. Further apartments were dealt by random. Criticism Professor Ari Hyytinen says the Hitas system favours those who have the time and possibility to queue outside, and as such is unfavourable towards families with children, single parents, people with long-time illnesses, and the elderly. He also claims that artificially low prices attract over-demand, along with its problems.Onko Hitas-järjestelmässä mitään järkeä?, professor Niku Määttänen 16 April 2010 & professor Ari Hyytinen 17 April 2010, Akateemi talousblogi. According to professor Niko Määttänen the Hitas system makes no sense, because of the following reasons: The apartments are targeted inefficiently A greater problem than the queuing is that the system causes apartments to be targeted poorly to different kinds of people. Because of the low prices, the apartments end up in the hands of those who happen to buy them, not those who might have use for them. As well as this, it is inefficient for the people to move out of their cheap apartments even when their housing needs change. Other apartments become more expensive Because of the inefficient targeting of the apartments, the shortage of apartments worsens, and the prices of non-Hitas apartments rise. The system is expensive The city loses money renting out or selling lots below the market price. This support is targeted to middle-class individuals instead of equally among citizens, which Määttänen claims is unfair. According to Määttänen, the effect on segregation is weakened by people renting out Hitas apartments to well-off tenants.

It was originally released on 14 August 1970 in Hong Kong and was one of the top grossing Hong Kong films between the years of 1970 and 1972. Plot In 880s imperial China, the Tang dynasty court no longer had effective control of its empire, and the national capital Chang'an was sacked by Huang Chao's anti-government army. Li Keyong, a Shatuo chieftain loyal to the Tang cause, led his troops to suppress the rebellion. His 13 generals—essentially all adopted sons—helped expel Huang from Chang'an, although a rift between some of them became more and more apparent in the process. Following the victory, Li Keyong accepted an invitation for a banquet at military governor Zhu Wen's territory of Bianliang, unaware that it was a trap to assassinate him. Cast and characters * Ku Feng as Li Keyong, Prince of Jin * Chin Han as Li Siyuan, Li Keyong's 1st general * Pao Chia-win as Li Sizhao, Li Keyong's 2nd general * Lo Wei as Li Cunxu, Li Keyong's 3rd general * Nam Seok-hun as Li Cunxin, Li Keyong's 4th general * Liu Kang as Li Cunzhi, Li Keyong's 5th general * Sung Yuan as Li Cunke, Li Keyong's 6th general * Huang Pei-chi as Li Cunjin, Li Keyong's 7th general * Wang Kuang-yu as Li Cunzhang, Li Keyong's 8th general * Chen Chuan as Li Cunshen, Li Keyong's 9th general * Lau Kar-wing as Li Cunshou, Li Keyong's 10th general * Ti Lung as Shi Jingsi, Li Keyong's 11th general * Wang Chung as Kang Junli, Li Keyong's 12th general * David Chiang as Li Cunxiao, Li Keyong's 13th general * Chan Sing as Zhu Wen, the Bianliang governor (he was an officer under Huang Chao before he surrendered to the Tang government) * Lee Hae-ryong as Huang Chao, the rebel leader, self-proclaimed Qi emperor * Bolo Yeung as Meng Juehai, Huang's general * Jin Bong-jin as Zhang Quan, Huang's general * Lily Li as Cuiyan, a young woman in Chang'an Deviations from history Some events in the film are loosely based on history, such as Li Keyong's troops expelling Huang Chao from Chang'an in the summer of 883, and Zhu Wen's failed assassination attempt of Li Keyong a year later that took the lives of Shi Jingsi and many others. However, many other events have been fictionalized. While Li Cunxiao did in fact have a strained relationship with Li Cunxin and Kang Junli and did die by dismemberment, he was actually the one who betrayed Li Keyong, who eventually executed him. Except for Kang who was killed by Li Keyong in relation to Li Cunxiao's death, no other general died from infighting. In history, Shi and Kang were not adopted sons of Li Keyong, hence their different surnames from the other generals, in fact Kang was Li Keyong's senior by 9 years. Li Cunjin was one of the oldest adopted sons, and both Li Cunxin and Li Cunshen were older than Li Siyuan, and quite possibly Li Sizhao and Li Cunzhang as well. Li Cunxu, a few dozen years younger than most of his adoptive brothers, was not even born in 883-884. Li Keyong was not created \\"Prince of Jin\\" until 895, a good 12 years after expelling Huang Chao from Chang'an. Zhu Wen (who since 882 bore the name Zhu Quanzhong) was actually called the Xuanwu governor instead of the \\"Bianliang governor\\"—Bianliang being a much later name of Xuanwu's capital Bianzhou. The film got one detail right: according to historical records, Li Keyong had one eye smaller than the other. Reception Empire Online gave The Heroic Ones four out of five stars, saying that although the film was \\"occasionally uneven in pace, [it] nonetheless delivers spectacular action and earns its rep as a must-have.\\" Far East Films remarked that it was a \\"worthwhile addition to anyone's collection though, but is not among Cheh's finest works\\". The film has experienced some success since its original release in 1970 and has been screened at the 2004 Melbourne International Film Festival.

This festival is held in October. Grevenbicht is a village in the far south of the Netherlands, near to the border of Belgium and Germany. Musicians from countries in Europe and around the world travel to meet and perform. During the festival about 10 bands or 40 musicians perform. Every year the Bluegrass Beeg attracts 500 to 600 visitors. Bluegrass Beeg is organized by Foundation AutiVriendelijk Limburg.  Format and design of the festival During the bluegrass festival there are stage performances that take place in the public room of the building 'Oos Hoes'. The bluegrass bands from Europe participate in a battle to win the Bluegrass Beeg award. The public votes to determine who is the best band and gave the best performance. Parallel to the festival, workshops dealing with bluegrass are performed by renowned European and American bluegrass musicians. There are also activities and workshops for children of all ages. Bluegrass Beeg strives to be a family oriented bluegrass event as well. Near the location is a public parking lot which can be used. Musicians and public use the parking lot to play together. Bluegrass Beeg supplies its attendees with around the clock first aid volunteers, security and a transportation system to and from the festival. The festival is Autism- friendly organized. This means that necessary measurements are taken for people to be able to enter the festival safely as a visitor, a volunteer or as an artist. The format of the festival helps people with autistic qualities to participate active or passive in an international social society.  Background  In the Netherlands there is a relative small group approximately 2000 persons busy with bluegrass music. In the Autumn of 2013 the first autism friendly took place. In 2013 the next countries participated: Belgium, Germany and Netherlands. In the first year ten Bluegrassbands performed one or more times. This festival sets an example for local 'Picking Parties' organized through the year. Bluegrass originates from Northern America. Therefore the main language is English. Among others a few big names in the world of Bluegrass are Bill Monroe, Earl Scruggs and Lester Flatt. More musicians can be found at the List of bluegrass musicians.

However, it remains possible that he could be held indefinitely: §44 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act permits a suspect to be held 16 days from the time of his arrest and §241 of the 1955 Prevention of Corruption Act permits him to be held up to a year without trial. Such a decision will be considered by the Ministry of Home Affairs and an advisory council before being personally made by President Halimah Yacob. Further, Singapore still does not formally acknowledge his detention and the year-long pretrial term can be extended by the authorities. He was released on appeal to the Court of Appeal in 2015.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/alleged-match-fixing- mastermind-freed-after-court-rules-against-continued  References   External links  * An article by the Telegraph showing all major international football-fixing scandals through late November 2013 1964 births Living people Singaporean businesspeople Singaporean people of Chinese descent Match fixers ","title":"Dan Tan"},{"id":"41230918","text":"Arthur Tashko (1901-1994) was an Albanian born in Korçë, in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Albania) 10 April 1901, an American modern painter, lawyer and musician.

In 2013 she was awarded the inaugural Brunel University African Poetry Prize, chosen from a shortlist of six candidates out of a total 655 entries. Her words \\"No one leaves home unless/home is the mouth of a shark\\", from the poem \\"Conversations about Home (at a deportation centre)\\", have been called \\"a rallying call for refugees and their advocates\\". Life Born on 1 August 1988 in Kenya to Somali parents, Shire migrated with her family to the United Kingdom at the age of one. She has four siblings. She has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Writing. As of 2015, she primarily resides in Los Angeles, California. In 2011, she released Teaching My Mother How To Give Birth, a poetry pamphlet published by Flipped eye. Her full collection was released in 2016, also through Flipped Eye. Shire has read her poetry in various artistic venues throughout the world, including in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, North America, South Africa and Kenya. Her poems have been published in various literary publications, including Poetry Review, Magma and Wasafiri. Additionally, Shire's verse has been featured in the collections Salt Book of Younger Poets (Salt, 2011), Ten: The New Wave (Bloodaxe, 2014), and New Daughters of Africa (edited by Margaret Busby, 2019).Obi-Young, Otosirieze (10 January 2018), \\"Margaret Busby-Edited Anthology to Feature 200 Female Writers Including Adichie, Aminatta Forna, Bernardine Evaristo, Imbolo Mbue, Warsan Shire, Zadie Smith\\", Brittle Paper. Her poetry has also been translated into a number of languages, including Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish and Estonian. As of 2016, Shire is working on her first full-length poetry collection, having put out a limited-release pamphlet called Her Blue Body in 2015. She serves as the poetry editor at SPOOK magazine and she teaches poetry workshops both globally and online for cathartic and aesthetic purposes. Shire's poetry featured prominently in Beyoncé's 2016 feature-length film Lemonade. Knowles-Carter's interest in using Shire's work was sparked with Shire's piece \\"For Women Who Are Difficult to Love\\".  Influences  Shire uses not only her own personal experiences but also the experiences of people to whom she is close. She is quoted as saying: \\"I either know, or I am, every person I have written about, for or as. But I do imagine them in their most intimate settings.\\" Her main interest is writing about and for people who are generally not heard otherwise, e.g. immigrants and refugees as well as other marginalized groups of people. Shire is also quoted as saying: \\"I also navigate a lot through memory, my memories and other people's memories, trying to essentially just make sense of stuff.\\" As a first-generation immigrant, she has used her poetry to connect with her home country of Somalia, which she has never been to. She uses this position as an immigrant herself to convey the lives of these peoples. Shire utilizes the influences of her close relatives, and family members and their experiences to depict in her poetry the struggles that they have all faced. Awards and honours Shire has received various awards for her art. In April 2013, she was presented with Brunel University's inaugural African Poetry Prize, an award earmarked for poets who have yet to publish a full-length poetry collection. She was chosen from a shortlist of six candidates out of a total 655 entries. In October 2013, Shire was selected from a shortlist of six as the first Young Poet Laureate for London.

He has been described as \\"the father of cancer genetics.\\" Early life and education He was born October 21, 1866, in Greensburg, Indiana. His parents were Edward Mason Warthin and Eliza Margaret (Weist) Warthin. As a young man he studied piano and earned a teacher's diploma from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1877. In 1888 he received an A.B. in science from Indiana University. He then entered the University of Michigan Medical School, earning an M.A. in 1890, an M.D. in 1891 and a Ph.D. in 1893. He did postgraduate study in Vienna and Freiburg, then joined the faculty at the University of Michigan, where he remained for the rest of his career. Career In 1892 he was appointed a demonstrator in internal medicine at the University of Michigan. In 1895 he took charge of the pathology laboratory, and in 1903 he was named laboratory director and professor of pathology, positions he held until his death in 1931. He also served as chair of the pathology department for most of that time. He taught more than 3,000 medical students, who described him as \\"the greatest living teacher of pathology\\". He was a master of the American College of Physicians and served as its first vice president. He also served as editor of the Annals of Clinical Medicine (now the Annals of Internal Medicine). In 1930 he published a book \\"The Creed of a Biologist: A Biologic Philosophy of Life. It he argues in favor of the theory, popular at the time, of the genetic transmission of acquired traits and extols the importance of using Eugenics for the protection and improvement of the race. The book ends with the following postscript: \\"CREDO :: I BELIEVE IN THE LAW * IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE GERM PLASM AND THE CREATIVE * PROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION OF LIFE * IN THE VARIABILITY OF THE VALUE OF THE GERM PLASM THROUGH HEREDITY & ENVIRONMENT * IN THE TRANSMISSION OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERS * AND IN THE CONSCIOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE RACE THROUGH THE LAWS OF VOLITIVE EUGENICS * I BELIEVE THAT THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIFE IS THE PROTECTION * IMPROVEMENT AND CONTINUATION OF THE IMMORTAL GERM PLASM * .....\\" Research In 1895, a young seamstress of his acquaintance told him about her family's long history of cancer deaths. Intrigued, he researched her family's history, searching death records and administering questionnaires, and found multiple cases of cancer. He followed the family, which he called \\"family G\\", for decades, and in 1913 he published their history in the Archives of Internal Medicine. His article was one of the first to make the case that cancer was heritable in humans, and the medical pedigree of family G (which was later determined to suffer from hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch Syndrome) is one of the longest and most detailed cancer genealogies in the world. By 1913 he had worked up the pedigrees of 29 cancer-susceptible families. He found one family in which 27 of the 144 descendants of a cancer patient also had cancer. He located several sets of identical twins that developed identical cancers in mirror-image sites. He became convinced that both susceptibility and immunity to cancer could be inherited. He began his genetic studies before Gregor Mendel's principles of genetics became widely known. It took many decades before the heritability of cancer was finally accepted by the medical community, partly through the research of Henry T. Lynch. Although he is best known today for his groundbreaking research on the heritability of cancer, during his lifetime he was better known for other things. He studied the pathology of syphilis for 20 years and became the world's leading authority on the subject. He and his research associate developed the Warthin-Starry stain still used to demonstrate the presence of syphilis spirochetes. Some thought his most important work was his study of diseases of the reticuloendothelial system. He studied the effects of the chemical weapon mustard gas, about which he co- wrote a book in 1919. Personal life In 1900 he married another physician, Katherine Angell (born 1869), and they had four children. She died in 1940. His hobbies included golf, raising flowers (especially phlox), and collecting artistic portrayals of death, about which he wrote a scholarly monograph, The Physician of the Dance of Death. He died suddenly of asthma on May 23, 1931. He is buried in South Park Cemetery, Greensburg, Indiana.

Although these taxes would be levied and collected in accordance with an Act of Parliament, they would not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India, but would accrue to the States themselves in accordance with such principles of distribution as may be formulated by Parliament by law. The 6th Amendment also expressly empowers Parliament to formulate by the principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Parliament was also empowered to formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place outside a State, or in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the territory of India. Further, it gave Parliament the power to declare by law the goods which are of special importance to inter-State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) would be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the sale or purchase of those goods. Text Constitutional changes Section 2 of the 6th Amendment inserted a new entry 92A in the Union List. It also re-enacted entry 54 on the State List which previously read, \\"Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspaper\\". This brings taxes on inter-State sales and purchases of goods other than newspapers within the exclusive legislative and executive power of the Union and makes Entry 54 of the State List \\"subject to the provisions\\" of this new entry. Section 3(a) of the Act added taxes on inter-State sales and purchase of goods other than newspapers to the list given in clause (1) of article 269 by inserting a new sub-clause (g) in that article. Although these taxes would be levied and collected in accordance with an Act of Parliament, they would not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India, but would accrue to the States themselves in accordance with such principles of distribution as may be formulated by Parliament by law. Section 3(b) inserted a new clause (3) in article 269. The new clause expressly empowers Parliament to formulate by the principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Section 4 omitted the Explanation given in clause (1), and re-enacted clauses (2) and (3). Clause (2) was revised to empower Parliament to formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place outside a State, or in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the territory of India. Under the revised clause (3) of article 286, Parliament will have the power to declare by law the goods which are of special importance to inter- State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) would be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the sale or purchase of those goods. The full text of Article 286 of the Constitution, prior to being amended by section 4 of the 6th Amendment, is given below: Background While \\"taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers\\" was an entry in the State List, article 286 of the Constitution subjected the States' power to impose such taxes to four restrictions, of which two are total and two are partial. Under clause (1) of the article, a State is debarred from imposing such a tax when the sale or purchase takes place outside the State or in the course of import of the goods into, or export from, the country. With regard to the first restriction, namely, the non-taxability of sales outside the State, an explanation is given in the clause that \\"a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State\\". Then, under clause (2), a State is debarred from imposing the tax on inter-State sales except in so far as Parliament may otherwise provide. Lastly, under clause (3), Parliament is authorised to declare the goods which are essential to the life of the community, and when such a declaration has been made, any law made by a State Legislature imposing a tax on the sale or purchase of those goods has to receive the President's assent in order to be effective. High judicial authorities found interpretation of the article to be a difficult task and expressed divergent views as to the scope and effect, in particular, of the explanation in clause (1) and of clause (2). The majority view of the Supreme Court in the State of Bombay v. United Motors (India) Ltd., was that sub-clause (a) and the explanation in clause (1) prohibited the taxation of a sale involving inter-State elements by all States except the State in which the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption therein, and furthermore, that clause (2) did not affect the power of that State to tax the inter-State sale even though Parliament had not made a law removing the ban imposed by that clause. This resulted in dealers resident in one State being subjected to the sales tax jurisdiction and procedure of several other States with which they had dealings in the normal course of their business. Two-and-a-half years later, the second part of this decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in the Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. State of Bihar, but here too the Court was not unanimous. In pursuance of clause (3) of the article, Parliament passed an Act in 1952 declaring a number of goods like foodstuff of various kinds, cloth, raw cotton, cattle feeds, iron and steel, coal, etc. to be essential to the life of the community. Since this declaration could not affect pre-existing State laws imposing sales tax on these goods, the result was a wide disparity from State to State, not only in the range of exempted goods, but also in the rates applicable to them. The Taxation Enquiry Commission examined the problem and made certain recommendations which might be summarised as follows. In essence, sales tax must continue to be a State source of revenue and its levy and administration must substantially pertain to the State Governments. The sphere of power and responsibility of the State might, however, be said to end, and that of the Union to begin, when the sales tax of one State impinges, administratively on the dealers, and fiscally on the consumers, of another State. Broadly, therefore, inter-State sales should be the concern of the Union, but the responsibilities pertaining to the Union could be exercised through the State Governments, and in any case, the revenue should appropriately devolve on them. Intra-State sales, on the other hand, should be left to the States, but with one important exception. Where, for instance, raw material produced in a State is important from the point of view of the consumer or the industry of another State, certain restrictions have to be placed on the taxing power of the State Government, as otherwise it can effect an increase in the cost of the manufactured article, whether such manufacture takes place in the State which produces the raw material, or in another State which imports the material from the State. In either case, to the extent that the finished goods are consumed in a State other than the one which taxes the raw material, the increase in cost on account of the tax is a matter of direct concern to the consumer of another State. Such cases of intra-State sales should appropriately be brought under the full control of the Union. These recommendations of the Commission had been generally accepted by all the State Governments. Proposal and enactment The bill of The Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 3 May 1956, as the Constitution (Tenth Amendment) Bill, 1956 (Bill No. 35 of 1956). It was introduced by M.C. Shah, then Minister of Revenue and Civil Expenditure, and sought to amend articles 269, 286 and the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution to remove certain anomalies regarding taxes on inter-State sales and purchases. The object of the Bill was to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission as regards the amendment of the constitutional provisions relating to sales tax. In clause 2, it was proposed to add a new Entry 92A in the Union List placing taxes on inter-State sales and purchases within the exclusive legislative and executive power of the Union, and to make Entry 54 of the State List “subject to the provisions\\" of this new entry. In clause 3, the Bill proposed to add these taxes to the list given in clause (1) of article 269, so that, although they would be levied and collected in accordance with an Act of Parliament, they would not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India, but would accrue to the States themselves in accordance with such principles of distribution as might be formulated by Parliament by law. A further provision was proposed in article 269 expressly empowering Parliament to formulate by law principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. It was proposed in clause 4 to omit from clause (1) of article 286 the Explanation which had given rise to a great deal of legal controversy and practical difficulty. In view of the centralisation of inter-State sales tax proposed in clause 2 of this Bill, clause (2) of article 286 in its present form would cease to be appropriate. In its place, it was proposed to insert a provision empowering Parliament to formulate principles for determining in case of a sale or purchase of goods outside a State, in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India, or in the course of export of the goods out of the territory of India. It was further proposed to replace clause (3) of article 286 by a new clause on the lines recommended by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. Under this revised clause Parliament would have the power to declare by law the goods which were of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) would be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the sale or purchase of those goods. The bill was debated by the Lok Sabha on 7 May 1956, and on 9 May, the House moved and adopted a motion to refer the bill to a Joint Committee of the Houses of Parliament. This motion was concurred in the Rajya Sabha on 16 May 1956. The Joint Committee presented its Report to the Lok Sabha on 23 May 1956, recommending that the Bill be passed, as no amendments to it were necessary. The Bill was then considered and passed by the Lok Sabha on 29 May 1956. A formal amendment, moved by then Minister of Finance C.D. Deshmukh, substituting the brackets and words \\"(Tenth Amendment)\\" in clause 1 by the brackets and words \\"(Sixth Amendment)\\", was also adopted. Clause 2 (seeking insertion of a new Entry 92A in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule), clause 3 (amending article 269) and clause 4 (amending article 286) were adopted in their original form. The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 31 May 1956. The bill, after ratification by the States, received assent from then President Rajendra Prasad on 11 September 1956. It was notified in The Gazette of India, and came into force on the same date. Ratification The Bill was passed in accordance with the provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution, and was ratified by the Legislatures of more than one-half of the States specified in Parts A and B of the First Schedule by resolutions to that effect passed by those Legislatures before the Bill making provision for such amendment is presented to the President for assent, as required by the said article. State Legislatures that ratified the amendment are listed below: # Andhra State # Assam # Hyderabad # Madhya Bharat # Madhya Pradesh # Madras # Punjab # Patiala and East Punjab States Union # Saurashtra # Uttar Pradesh # West Bengal Did not ratify: # Bihar # Bombay # Orissa # Jammu and Kashmir # Mysore # Rajasthan # Travancore-Cochin # Vindhya Pradesh See also *List of amendments of the Constitution of India References 06 1956 in India 1956 in law Nehru administration ","title":"Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of India"},{"id":"41231127","text":"Ocypode fabricii is a species of ghost crabs endemic to the coast of northern and western Australia, from Darwin to Shark Bay.

Maskey spearheaded the trend of creating art using new techniques for its aesthetic value, and introduced a new style in the milieu of traditional art which is essentially religious and follows descriptions laid down in ancient texts. Early life Maskey was born in Kathmandu to a Newar family that traditionally served as officials in the government. He abandoned family tradition and chose art as a career. He was also one of the very few Nepalese artists to get an opportunity to study modern art abroad, as the autocratic Rana regime kept tight control on modern education. In those days, the king was a nominal ruler while the Rana prime minister for life held actual power. From 1918 to 1923, Maskey studied art at the Government School of Art, Kolkata. He was among the first two officially recognized art teachers in Nepal. The other was Tej Bahadur Chitrakar (1898-1971). After returning to Kathmandu, Maskey held the first ever one-man exhibition in Nepal in 1928. He also began teaching art at Durbar High School and Padma Kanya Girls High School. In jail Maskey aroused the anger of the Rana regime by starting a public school, and it looked for an opportunity to punish him. In 1940, he was convicted of drawing an anti-Rana cartoon and sentenced to 18 years in jail and all his property was confiscated. Maskey served five years and was released in 1945. In prison, one of his fellow inmates was poet Chittadhar Hridaya who had been given a six-year sentence for writing a poem about his late mother which was deemed subversive. Hridaya spent his time in prison secretly writing an epic based on the Buddha's life. Maskey drew the paintings to illustrate the epic entitled Sugata Saurabha which was published when they were both released. Later years Two years after being released from prison, Maskey resumed teaching at Padma Kanya Girls High School. In 1957, he and his friends opened the Popular University of Kathmandu which was shut down after six months. Maskey has served as the director of Nepal National Museum, Department of Culture and Archaeology and National Zoo, and adviser to the Nepal Association of Fine Arts (NAFA). Maskey's paintings have been described as a chronicle of Nepalese life and culture. He has painted everyday scenes of rural Nepal as well as ceremonies and celebrations. His works consist of pencil, pen and ink drawings, oils and watercolors. Honors In 1995, the Postal Services Department of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting a portrait of Chandra Man Singh Maskey to honor his contribution to the development of art in Nepal.

The conflict ended on 6 December when Saudi forces retook al-Wadiah. Background The town was placed along the contentious border of South Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and had some fifteen years prior, in 1954/5, been the site of a border dispute between the Saudis and the British. Al-Wadiah had previously been part of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, itself part of the Protectorate of South Arabia, which had been incorporated into the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen following the withdrawal of British forces from the region. The PRSY therefore considered the town as part of its territory. The Saudi government however saw al-Wadiah as part of their own territory, as well as a frontier in confrontations with the PRSY. There were also rumors of oil and water deposits around the town, thereby aggravating the dispute. Simultaneously PRSY-Saudi relations had been incredibly tense, with Faisal of Saudi Arabia regarding the left-wing government with extreme hostility, which was in turn reciprocated by the PRSY, which supported the overthrow of the Gulf monarchies. The Saudi government went so far as to fund and arm South Yemeni dissidents, and encouraged them to conduct raids across the border into South Yemen. The PRSY accused the Saudi government of planning further attacks in November 1969. PRSY Advance In November 1969, the Saudis built a road to al-Wadiah and garrisoned soldiers there, incorporating it into the Kingdom. The PRSY government claimed that the Saudis had occupied al-Wadiah in order to secure potential oil reserves in the area. The Saudi government in turn accused the PRSY of seizing al-Wadiah. On 27 November 1969, PRSY regular army units advanced on, and took, the town of al-Wadiah. Saudi forces deployed in the region were limited to some tribal militias, backed by some aircraft and artillery. A small section of the PRSY force began advancing on Sharurah, but was halted. Having been informed of the PRSY advance, King Faisal ordered Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the Minister of Defense and Aviation, to expel PRSY forces. Sultan commissioned all units in the southern region for the task of attempting to reoccupy al-Wadiah within two days. Saudi counterattack The first phase (air strikes) The initial part of the conflict was largely limited to aerial battles, with a series of air clashes taking place in late November and early December. During this initial period Iraq and Jordan attempted to mediate an end to the conflict. The Royal Saudi Air Force also conducted a series of aerial bombardments. These attacks continued over the course of two days, initially being directed at PRSY Army forces in the region, and later specifically at the PRSY leadership, whilst also attacking PRSY logistics. The second phase (ground attack) At 0945 in the morning, the Saudi ground offensive began advancing on Yemeni positions on two axes: A battalion of Saudi National Guard units, along with some other forces, advanced on Yemeni positions from the West. A second group, composed of exiled Yemenis and Saudi border guards, advanced on Yemeni positions from the east. During the attack PRSY forces were divided into two pockets. A PRSY counterattack failed to unite the pockets. The following day clashes began at dawn, and continued throughout the day. The commander of the PRSY Brigade was killed in the fighting, following which PRSY forces began to withdraw. Saudi forces harassed PRSY forces during the retreat, although stopped at the border under orders. The third phase (reinforcement) Saudi forces then proceeded to take up defensive positions within al-Wadiah. Some abandoned PRSY equipment was seized. The Saudis claimed to have occupied al-Wadiah by 5 December, and took journalists to the town. Saudi forces claimed to have killed 35 soldiers from the PRSY, and also claimed that they could have marched on Aden, the PRSY capital, had they not been ordered to stop at the border by King Faisal. Aftermath Following the conflict the Saudi government began a large scale program of construction of military sites in the region, whilst also deploying further military forces to Sharurah, close to al-Wadiah. Tensions continued, especially after the 1972 Tripoli Agreement, under which North and South Yemen agreed to merge, due to Saudi hostility to any merger. In March 1973 Saudi Arabia claimed that two PRSY MiGs had attacked al-Wadiah, although the PRSY denied any such incident, and claimed Saudi Arabia was searching for a pretext for military intervention in South Yemen. There was a brief warming of relations between the two countries in November 1977, although this soon lapsed and ambassadors were recalled by both countries. There were further reports of clashes in January 1978, including the shooting down of 4 RSAF Lightnings by a PRSY MiG, although this was denied. There were minor clashes in February 1987. The issue of ownership was finally settled by the Treaty of Jeddah of 2000, which affirmed Saudi ownership of the town.

History Proposal and design stage (2008-2011) Wynn Macau Ltd's land reserve on Cotai Strip in 2011, showing the plot before the start of construction on the Wynn Palace. In 2006, the hotel and casino Wynn Macau was launched in the city of Macau by Wynn Resorts, a Las Vegas-based hospitality and development company. Wynn Macau, Ltd became a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, with Wynn Resorts owning 72.2% of Wynn Macau, Ltd. Following the opening of Wynn Macau, Wynn Enterprises expressed interest in opening a second resort nearby and began looking into land on the Cotai Strip, which is similar to the Vegas Strip in its focus on luxury casino-hotels and entertainment. In 2008, Wynn Resorts paid US$50 million to Tien Chiao Entertainment and Investment Company Limited \\"in exchange for the company relinquishing its rights to what is now Wynn's Cotai site,\\" a plot in close proximity to casinos such as City of Dreams, Las Vegas Sands, St. Regis Macao and Sheraton Resorts. Steve Wynn, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Wynn Resorts, announced in mid-August 2010 that he would be building a new casino-resort on the plot, and that the Cotai project could break ground in March or April 2011, or as soon as the building's design was completed. He estimated that the resort could open within five years after the start of construction. The overall development was initially projected to cost over MOP 20 billion, and would more than double the operator's hotel rooms in the special administrative regions of China (SAR). The development's designs were advanced throughout 2010 and early 2011. Land concession contract (2011) As of May 16, 2011, Steve Wynn was expecting the Government of Macau to approve the application for the Cotai resort shortly, with construction to begin right after. Wynn stated to the press in May 2011, \\"I believe the Cotai project is the best work we have done... it has many new things and new approaches to the way the property is presented.... now that we have nine years of experience in Macau, as you saw with [Encore at Wynn Macau] we are learning how to really address the emotional and physical needs of our guests.\\" At the time, Wynn estimated that the proposed hotel-casino would need around 9,000 staff. Wynn Macau announced on September 12, 2011 that it had accepted a land concession contract from the Macau government to develop of the plot. Specifically, the contract permitted Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. and Wynn Resort's Palo Estate Company Ltd unit to develop a resort containing a five-star hotel, gaming areas, retail, entertainment, food and beverage outlets, a spa, and convention offerings. Under the contract, Palo Estate will lease the land from the Macau government for an initial term of 25 years, with a right to renew the lease. On top of a US$193 million land premium payment to the Macau government, Palo must also pay $771,738 in yearly rent during the resort's development phase, which increases to $1 million in yearly rent after development is complete. In December 2011, Wynn made a deposit of $62.6 million for the land, with eight more projected payments of $16.4 million. At the time, the project's overall budget was estimated at $2.5 billion, with design still in flux. Approval and groundbreaking (2012-2013) On May 1, 2012, Wynn Macau received formal approval from the Macau government for its Cotai resort, paving the way for ground to be broken on the plot. A cost was not revealed at the time, though financing would be mostly cash and partly loans. Wynn Macau, Ltd announced on June 5, 2012, that it had started the first stage of construction, with an estimated cost of US$4 billion and a projected construction timeline of around four years. Overall, the development would equal , with the height of the skyscraper restricted to due to a nearby airport. The resort's design as of June 2012 included a hotel with convention space, shops, entertainment, ten restaurants, 500 gaming tables, a spa, meeting rooms, and a nightclub named 'Climax,' among other attractions. While no real estate projects were announced as part of the new casino resort, Wynn did state that there was space to develop such properties if policy allowed. Pre-foundation work started in February 2013, with the name of the new skyscraper, Wynn Palace, first announced on July 29, 2013. Steve Wynn described Wynn Palace as \\"the most aggressive, ambitious and lovely project\\" he had ever undertaken, outlining new attractions such as gondolas, pedestal gardens, and a performance lake at the entrance and a 1,700-room hotel. The construction firm Leighton Asia, India and Offshore Group finalized a US$2.6 billion design and build contract on July 30, 2013 to construct Wynn Palace, with clients listed as Wynn Resorts (Macau) S.A. and Palo Real Estate Development Company S.A. The Australian parent company Leighton Holdings had been selected as the preferred contractor in November 2012, and had previously constructed Wynn Macau. Leighton projected a 2016 completion date for Wynn Palace. Wynn Macau, Ltd had invested a total of US$519 million in the project by the summer of 2013, with US$109.9 million invested during that year's third quarter. Initial construction stages (2014-2015) By the summer of 2014, Wynn Macau, Ltd was one of only six licensed casino operators in Macau. In July 2014, Reuters reported that Macau's corruption agency was examining the 2008 sale of Wynn's Cotai land plot for signs of graft, after the International Union of Operating Engineers requested an inquiry into \\"how a little-known company [like Tien Chiao Entertainment and Investment Company had] secured rights to land before it was granted to Wynn.\\" In response, Macau's Land, Public Works and Transport Bureau announced that the land grant had followed legal procedures. Foundations for the Wynn Palace were being laid by July 2014. During the ensuing construction process, at one point eleven tower cranes from Comansa CM were being used simultaneously. Work commenced on the casino's interior design in October 2014, with Chinese interior decoration subcontractor Sundart projecting completion for November 2015. On February 2, 2015, Wynn Macau, Ltd announced that the opening of Wynn Palace had been delayed, and would no longer take place before the February 2016 Chinese New Year. The delay resulted from late and incomplete approval of workers permits, with Barron's Asia explaining that \\"they received only 700 workers after requesting 1000 and the approvals came three months late. Wynn said they need a total of 7000 workers, which means they need approvals for another 1600-1700.\\" The resort announced it was still on budget despite the delay, with a new estimated launch for the first half of 2016. Final construction stages (2015-2016) Approximately US$374.3 million was invested into the Wynn Palace Cotai project during the first quarter of 2015, making the accumulative investment equal to US$2.2 billion. As of April 2015, the total projected budget including \\"construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees\\" was US$4.1 billion. Wynn Macau, Ltd was seeking government approval for 500 gaming tables by the fall of 2015. In November 2015, around 130 non-resident construction workers for Wynn Palace staged a meeting outside the PRC Liaison Office, alleging unpaid and involuntary overtime. The Labour Affairs Bureau (DSAL) subsequently stated that it had been aware of the situation since October 2015, and had promised staff to examine the issue. Also in November 2015, general construction delays pushed the projected opening back three months, from March 25, 2016 to the original date of June 25, 2016. As a result, Leighton Holdings (then renamed CIMIC) lost access to a US$38 million bonus. Wynn Resorts share values fell 6 percent after the announcement, before rising again shortly afterwards. Wynn Macau, Ltd stated in January 2016 that if substantial delays continued, CIMIC might be liable for a maximum of US$200 million in damages. Following a further update, the current expected opening date is August 22, 2016. Although Wynn Palace was built to have space for 500 gaming tables, it was reported that Wynn Palace had only been allotted 100 gaming tables at opening, with 50 more to be allotted before 2019. As a result, Wynn moved 250 of their approved tables from nearby Wynn Macau to Wynn Palace, leaving to a total of 350 tables at Wynn Palace and 270 at Wynn Macau. Sixty of the 400 total tables at the casino are devoted to VIP guests, a high concentration in comparison to other Cotai casinos. Opening and Reception On January 28, 2016, Forbes described Wynn Palace's upcoming debut as one of the \\"20 Most Anticipated Hotel Openings Of 2016.\\" Despite an effort on behalf of the Chinese government to make new Cotai casinos into family-friendly attractions, before the opening Steve Wynn described Wynn Palace as \\"for adults\\" and \\"pitched at 21-year-olds or above.” On August 22, 2016, Steve Wynn unveiled the resort at an event officiated by political figures such as Chui Sai On of Macau. The official opening time for the casino was 8 pm on a Monday, considered a time of cultural significance, with opening ceremonies held around the musical fountain and in the ballroom. The Macau Post Daily wrote the following day that the opening drew \\"big crowds to Cotai to try their luck in the new casino,\\" and Wynn Palace's design met with a positive response. A week after the resort's opening, analysts claimed the casino had caused a \\"lackluster\\" to \\"marginal\\" increase in mass-market customers in Macau, with Credit Suisse reporting that VIP business to Macau remained consistent. Although Cotai's gambling profits had been steadily dropping since 2014 due to government crackdowns on corruption, among other factors, Macau's gross gaming revenue grew 1.1% for the month of August to $2.4 billion, \\"the first growth since May 2014 and beating street estimate of 1.5% decline.\\" Barron's credited \\"Macau casino operators\\" and the opening of Wynn Palace for the increase. Opining that Macau was experiencing a market \\"revival,\\" on September 16, 2016, Nasdaq reported that the shares of Wynn Resorts had \\"rallied to a 52-week high.\\" For Wynn Resorts, \\"gross gaming revenues (GGR) for the month of August rose 1.1%,\\" and AFR Weekend wrote that Wynn Resorts' \\"gamble\\" in Macau had paid off, per \\"signs that revenue in the gambling mecca has passed a key inflection point.\\" Features Design and architecture Opened on August 22, 2016, the Wynn Palace resort on the Cotai Strip includes a 1706-room luxury hotel, a casino, convention space, a spa and salon, and venues for retail, entertainment, and dining. Steve Wynn described it as \\"the most aggressive, ambitious and lovely project\\" he has ever undertaken, with a design \\"reminiscent\\" of the Bellagio in its use of fountains and lighting as a key attraction. With a construction floor area of around , after topping off in 2015 the main Wynn Palace tower is tall, with 29 floors and design by Wynn Design & Development. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, \\"the halls to the guest rooms are wider than those found in conventional hotels to evoke a sense of palatial living.\\" The article goes on to say that \\"the largest suites — there are four penthouses — have of living space, two master bedrooms with floor-to-ceiling views of the performance lake, walk-in closets, media rooms, grand pianos and 24-hour butler service. The beds have 800-thread count Italian linen.\\" Attractions and venues The resort features a number of attractions and venues, including convention space, shops, restaurants, gaming tables, and meeting rooms. There are of luxury retail space in the Wynn Palace Esplanade, and as of September 2016, brands such as Chanel, Chopard, Hermès, Franck Muller, Panerai and Brioni had set up outlets. There are thirteen dining venues in Wynn Palace, with five fine dining restaurants, and eight casual. One of the luxury restaurants, Wing Lei Palace, was designed by Roger Thomas. GOCO Hospitality operates a spa area, with 22 treatment rooms and four spa suites, as well as a barber and beauty salon, tea lounge, juice bar, gym, and an area for foot massages. The spa offers $450 facials with gold leaf and crushed diamonds. Exterior features include an aerial transport system with gondolas, pedestal gardens, and a Performance Lake at the entrance. The Performance Lake is a fountain created by WET Design, with more than 1,000 jets and 2,000 lights that are synchronized to Beethoven and other musical pieces. Interior design and artwork Steve Wynn described the interior design theme as \\"flowers,\\" explaining the \\"use of... water and natural light and flowers has been taken to a new level.\\" Jerry Sibal was appointed Design, Development and Floral Director for Wynn Palace in April 2015, arriving in Macau that September. The Chinese interior design subcontractor Sundart published several photos of the Wynn Palace design in June 2015, displaying a floral theme. Some of the floral sculptures move. There is floral designer Preston Bailey's floral carousel and Ferris wheel in the atriums, among other projects. Fine art and Chinese antiques are display at the resort, including $150 million of art at opening. Wynn Macau, Ltd, first paid £8 million (US$12.8 million) at a London auction on July 7, 2011, for a set of four 18th-century Chinese porcelain vases, as well as a Chinoiserie tapestry. Explicitly purchased for Wynn Palace, Roger Thomas executive vice president of design for Wynn Design and Development said after the sale that \\"we are delighted to return works of this extraordinary quality to the city of Macau.\\" The vases and sixteenth-century Louis XIV Beauvais Chinoiserie tapestry of 'The Emperor on a Journey' were shown on October 27, 2011, in the Wynn Macau lobby, and will \\"later on join other pieces of art in the new hotel in Cotai,\\" Wynn said. Transportation Wynn Palace is close to a ferry terminal and the Macau International Airport, and in 2012 it was announced that the new Macau LRT would stop at the lakeside front of the resort. In 2013 it was announced that Wynn Palace will have a light rail station stopping at midpoint of the performance lake. The light rail will have bridges going west to casinos such as City of Dreams, Hyatt and MGM, and east to the Wynn Palace sidewalk. A direct connection to the Wynn gondola system is in construction as well.

Pellegrinus was a member of a noble family of Trentino, the lords of Povo. He was a younger son of Duke Ulrich I of Carinthia. He was appointed Patriarch of Aquileia in 1130. He succeeded the Patriarch Gerardo (1122–1128). He was a faithful supporter of the emperors Conrad III and Frederick Barbarossa during their struggle against Rome. He reached an agreement of \\"peace and friendship\\" (pax et amicitia) with Archbishop Conrad I of Salzburg (died 1147) whereby the latter agreed to pay tithes to Aquileia for those properties which the archdiocese held in the patriarchate. Conrad's example was followed by pledges to pay their tithes from the others present when the agreement was reached at Pentecost. In 1146 he intervened before Pope Eugene III in Brescia. In 1150 he came into conflict with Engelberto, from the family of the Counts of Gorizia, who laid a claim against the assets of the church of Aquileia. Engelberto came to the meeting armed, and arrested Pellegrinus. However, under pressure from the other feudal lords Engelberto was forced to quickly release the patriarch. In 1158 Pellegrinus attended the emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the Diet of Roncaglia, held near Piacenza.

Early life Nevzad Hanım was born on 2 March 1902, in the mansion of Sultan Mehmed V's secretary Hüseyin Bey in Vişnezade, Beşiktaş, Istanbul. Born as Nimet Bargu, she was a member of the Albanian family, Bargu. Her father was Şaban Efendi Bargu, a palace gardener, and her mother was Hatice Hanım. She had two younger sisters, Emine Hayriye Nesrin Hanım (1905 – 1988) and Fatma Tüzehra Nevzer Hanım (born 1906), and a younger brother, Salih Bey (born 1908). Hüseyin Bey's wife Eda Hanım was the sister of her father. In 1913, on Eda Hanım's request, Demsan Hanım (sister- in-law of Mihrengiz Kadın, wife of Sultan Mehmed V) presented Nimet and her sister Nesrin in the imperial harem, where according to the custom of the Ottoman court her name was changed to Nevzad. She was then sent to the harem his son Şehzade Mehmed Ziyaeddin, where she served in the entourage of Safiye Ünüvar's student princesses and had taken the same classes and training as they. After Mehmed's accession to the throne in 1918, she became one of the kalfas and went over to his palace. First marriage Nevzad married on 1 September 1921 in the Yıldız Palace. She was given the title of \\"Second Fortunate\\". Mehmed was sixty-one while Nevzad was nineteen years old. The act of marrying her exacerbated the already frosty, and resentful relations between the children of Sultan Reşad, and Mehmed's own family. Furthermore, Mehmed was so smitten by his new wife as to be causing gossip in the capital due to his refusal to leave the harem and so part from her company. Nevzad remained childless. When Mehmed was deposed in 1922, she and other members of his family were imprisoned in the Feriye Palace. When the imperial family went to exile in March 1924, she went to live in with her aunt Fatma Hanım. On Mehmed's persisted requests, she joined the deposed Sultan in San Remo, in May 1924. Here they stayed in Villa Magnolia. After some months her sister Nesrin also joined her in San Remo. Nevzad was with Mehmed at the time of his death on 15 May 1926. Sami Bey, son of the sultan's sister Mediha Sultan confronted Nevzad, and attracted attention to the possibility of his uncle's having being murdered. Sami Bey, doubted that Nevzad was involved in his death. He interrogated her, and then sealed her personal property after the sultan's cupboards. Soon after Mehmed's death, Nevzad returned to Istanbul with her sister. Second marriage In 1928 she married captain Ziya Bey Seferoğlu, and took the name Nimet Seferoğlu. The same year she gave birth to a girl Sıdıka Selçuk, followed by a son Şaban Mustafa in 1931. Memoirs In 1937, Nevzad published her memoirs under the title Yıldız'dan San Remo'ya. The memoirs were published in Tan newspaper, and noteworthy information about Sultan Mehmed VI is gained. However, serious discussions were made about the memories' reliability at that period. Death Nevzad Hanım died at the age of ninety, on 23 June 1992 in her mansion in Göksu, Istanbul, and was buried in Karacaahmet Cemetery.

It was originally named Carrollcliffe and was built for \\"General\\" Howard Carroll, a journalist, playwright and businessman, with intention that it should be reflect Norman castles in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. It was built in two stages between 1897 and 1910 as the residence of General Howard Carroll, a newspaperman and playwright, to a design by the architect Henry Franklin Kilburn. Beginning in 1941, it served for decades as the headquarters of the financial firm Axe-Houghton Management. It was converted to a hotel during 1994-96. New owners Hanspeter and Steffi Walder of Tarrtown bought the property along with a group of investors in 1992. Their vision was to re-create Carrollcliff's glory days. The couple's vision was to convert the Castle into a luxury inn while rediscovering, and ultimately preserving the Castle's original beauty and charm. Their goal, Hanspeter says, is the operation of a hotel and restaurant that can be a haven for the stressed executive or professional desiring to relax in a setting that is warm, inviting, and majestic. In 2003, Elite Hotels, a limited liability company formed by C.

They also have better emotional health, lower stress, lower percentages of depression, better relationships, and are better equipped to solve life's problems. Sood claims that human mind wanders for half to two-thirds of the day and we can measure happiness through validated happiness scales, assessment is subjective Sood states that the classic fight-or-flight reaction is mostly due to the three major stress hormones, adrenaline, cortisol and norepinephrine Basic Tenets Sood's life work is committed to decreasing suffering and increasing happiness. As per Sood, pain is unavoidable, but a large proportion of suffering is optional. Suffering is unrelenting pain for which one cannot find meaning. Suffering can be decreased by greater self-awareness, developing intentional attention, and emotional resilience. Sood claims self-awareness is becoming aware of who we are as a species and how our brain operates. Sood notes that when we are awake, our brain seesaws between two functional modes - focused mode of intentional presence or default mode of mind wandering. An average person spends half to two-thirds of the day with a wandering attention. Bulk of this time is spent with neutral or negative thoughts. We also have a tendency to discount the good, inflate the bad, and make unhappy comparisons. All this leads to excessive stress. Sood emphasizes more on developing intentionality in choosing the direction and depth of attention, then in remaining in the present moment. Any species that has imagination, preferences and cares about the future, will struggle with being in the present. Further, instead of suggesting longer meditative practices, Sood teaches brief sprinkles of intentional attention, such as five thoughts of gratitude in the morning, choosing not to improve anyone in the family for first three minutes at the end of the day, noticing novelty in the ordinary, and sending silent 'I wish you wells' (kind attention). Emotional resilience is experiencing positive emotions and recovering relatively quickly from negative emotions. Sood prescribes five principles to develop emotional resilience - gratitude, compassion, acceptance, meaning, and forgiveness. Gratitude is recognizing and being thankful for all your blessings, little or large. Sood states that \\"I try my best to focus on what went right within what went wrong. There are so many things that I am grateful for. And when I focus on them I feel full and when I am full I am ready to give and I am also better able to withstand adversity.\\" Compassion is noticing and feeling others' suffering and doing something to alleviate it. That something could be tangible action, kind words or just a good wish or silent prayer. Being happy in others' success is also compassion. Compassion to self is as important as compassion for others. We don't recognize that we are humans and as capable of committing mistakes and being imperfect. Look at yourself with the eyes of the person who loves you the most. Love yourself, like your pet does. Acceptance is about flowing with adversity, creatively working with what is, being open to possibilities. For small things, focus on will it matter in five years; for bigger things, try to find meaning in it, some positive meaning. Acceptance isn't apathy, it is empowered engagement, acceptance is wisely letting go of the uncontrollable to save energy for the controllable. Meaning focuses on who you are, why you are here and what this world means. At the core, no matter what you do, you're an agent of service and love. You touch a part of the world, however small, and leave it a little better than you found it. The world itself is a giant school of learning. Forgiveness respects each person's humanness, recognizing we all are fallible and vulnerable to ignorant thoughts and actions. Forgiveness is your gift to yourself and others—a gift that provides peace and freedom to all.

The Paul-Wyatt cotton mills were the world's first mechanised cotton spinning factories. Operating from 1741 until 1764 they were built to house the roller spinning machinery invented by Lewis Paul and John Wyatt. They were not very profitable but they span cotton successfully for several decades. Development In 1738 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt obtained a patent for a cotton spinning machine that for the first time used the principle of two sets of rollers travelling at different speeds to enable fully mechanical spinning. The patent outlined the two key developments that were later to underlie both Richard Arkwright's water frame and James Hargreaves' spinning jenny, and made it possible for a single power source to drive more than one spinning machine. Wyatt envisaged \\"a kind of mill, with wheels turned either by horses, water or wind.\\" Using this technology, and with financial support provided by associates of the author Samuel Johnson, in the summer of 1741 Paul and Wyatt set up the Upper Priory Cotton Mill in Birmingham, the first mill to spin cotton \\"without the aid of human fingers\\". The mill \\"containing fifty rollers ... turned by two donkeys walking round an axis\\" was not a commercial success, with Wyatt unable to enforce the levels of organisation and discipline that an operation on this scale demanded; Andrew Ure was to comment that Wyatt was \\"favourably placed, in a mechanical point of view, for maturing his admirable scheme\\" but \\"a gentle and passive spirit, little qualified to cope with the hardships of a new manufacturing enterprise\\". Two years after its opening the mill was described as being in a \\"pitiful state\\" and in 1743 Wyatt was incarcerated in the Fleet Prison for debt. Matthew Boulton was later to observe that the Paul- Wyatt mill \\"would have got money had it been in good hands\\", but nothing is known of it after Wyatt's release in October 1743. Marvel's Mill in Northampton pictured in 1746 - the earliest known pictorial representation of a cotton mill.; Four other mills were set up using the Paul-Wyatt machinery in the following years. Edward Cave – publisher of The Gentleman's Magazine and one of the friends of Dr Johnson who had funded the development of Paul and Wyatt's invention – experimented in London with running the machinery by hand and by 1742 had set up 250 spindles at Marvell's Mill, a watermill in Northampton. This was the first cotton mill to be driven by water power. Cave experienced similar problems organising his workforce to Paul and Wyatt (\\"I have not got half my people come to work today\\" he wrote to Wyatt, \\"and I have no great fascination in the prospect I have to put myself in the power of such people\\") and the mill generated little profit, but was to continue operation until about 1764. Samuel Touchet set up a second Birmingham mill in conjunction with Paul and Wyatt in 1744; little is known of its fate, but it was sufficiently encouraging for Touchet to lease the Northampton mill from Cave for a period up to 1755. The final mill was Pinsley Mill established by Daniel Bourn in Leominster. This may have been in operation by 1744, but is first mentioned in 1748, when both Bourn and Paul patented machinery for carding cotton - a premilinary process that must be undertaken before spinning. Bourn's mill burned down in 1754 but must have had a considerable reputation, as the Manchester Mercury's report of the fire described it as being \\"erected there with great expense and skill\\" and \\"viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them\\" References Cotton mills Cotton industry in England Textile machinery manufacturers Spinning History of the textile industry in the United Kingdom Industrial Revolution in England 1741 works English inventions Industrial Revolution Manufacturing companies established in 1741 British companies established in 1741 Textile mills completed in the 18th century ","title":"Paul-Wyatt cotton mills"},{"id":"41232457","text":"Marshfield Township may refer to the following townships in the United States: * Marshfield Township, Lincoln County, Minnesota * Marshfield Township, Webster County, Missouri * Marshfield (township), Wood County, Wisconsin ","title":"Marshfield Township"},{"id":"41232473","text":"Li Congyi (李從益) (931History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51. – June 23, 947Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), known as the Prince of Xu (許王), was an imperial prince of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang. He was the youngest son of its second emperor Li Siyuan (Emperor Mingzong). In the confusion of the destruction of Later Tang's successor state Later Jin, he was forced into claiming imperial title by Xiao Han, a general of the Khitan Liao Dynasty (whose forces had destroyed Later Jin), and was subsequently killed by Liu Zhiyuan, the founder of the succeeding Later Han.  During Later Tang  Li Congyi was born in 931. He was Li Siyuan's youngest son, and the only one born after he became emperor. His biological mother was a concubine of Li Siyuan's, but nothing further is known in history about her identity. Li Siyuan gave Li Congyi to his favorite concubine, Consort Wang, to raise. (Similarly, Consort Wang raised Li Congyi's younger sister, the later Princess Yong'an.)New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 15. In 933, Li Siyuan created Li Congyi the Prince of Xu, at the same time that he created his adoptive son Li Congke and nephews Li Congwen (), Li Congzhang (), and Li Congmin () princes.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. (He already created his older biological sons Li Congrong and Li Conghou princes in 930, before Li Congyi's birth.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Later in 933, Li Congrong tried to seize power in Li Siyuan's illness, but was defeated and killed. When Li Siyuan died shortly after, Li Conghou succeeded to the throne. Subsequently, Li Congyi's wet nurse Lady Wang was exposed to have had an affair with Li Congrong and put to death. Because of this, Li Conghou also suspected Li Congyi's adoptive mother Consort Wang, but did not take further actions against her. In 934, Li Conghou was overthrown by Li Congke, who took the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In 936, Shi Jingtang — who had married Li Congyi's (and Li Congke's) sister the Princess of Jin and therefore was a brother-in-law — in turn, rebelled against Li Congke, initially declaring that as an adoptive son, Li Congke was unfit for the throne and should pass it to Li Congyi, but shortly after, with the support of the Khitan Liao Dynasty's Emperor Taizong, declared himself emperor of a new Later Jin, and attacked south toward the Later Tang capital Luoyang from his power base in Taiyuan after the joint Liao/Later Jin forces defeated the Later Tang forces Li Congke sent against him. The situation at Luoyang appeared hopeless, and Li Congke prepared for a mass suicide of his family members by fire. Li Congyi's mother Consort Wang (who then carried the title of consort dowager) tried to persuade Li Siyuan's wife, Empress Dowager Cao, who was the birth mother of the Princess of Jin, not to join in the mass suicide, but was unable to persuade the empress dowager. The empress dowager, however, urged her to live on, and so she took Li Congyi and Princess Yong'an, and hid in a polo field, while Empress Dowager Cao, Li Congke, Li Congke's immediate family members, and a number of officers loyal to him committed suicide by fire. Shi arrived at Luoyang shortly after and took over the realm.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280.  During Later Jin  After Later Jin's takeover of Later Tang territory, Shi Jingtang created Li Congyi's sister, the Later Tang Princess of Jin, empress. The empress took Li Congyi and Consort Dowager Wang into the palace, personally raised Li Congyi, and honored Consort Dowager Wang like a mother. In 939, Shi Jingtang created Li Congyi the Duke of XunZizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. and had him be in charge of offering sacrifices to five emperors of Tang Dynasty (which Later Tang claimed to be the legitimate successor to) and Later Tang — Tang's first emperors Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong, as well as Later Tang's founder Li Cunxu, Li Siyuan, and Li Conghou — at Zhide Palace (), where Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi resided. Shi Jingtang died in 942, and was succeeded as emperor by his nephew Shi Chonggui.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. After Shi Chonggui's succession, Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi returned to Luoyang and took up residence there. In contrast to Shi Jingtang's view of Khitan's Emperor Taizong (who had changed the name of his state to Liao by this point) as a benefactor — going as far as referring to himself as \\"Son Emperor\\" and \\"subject\\" while honoring Emperor Taizong as \\"Father Emperor\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. — Shi Chonggui, at the advice of the general Jing Yanguang, took a confrontational stance against the Khitan, initially only referring to himself as \\"grandson\\" and not as subject, and eventually went as far as closing the Liao trade office, seizing its assets, and killing Khitan merchants. This led to repeated Liao incursions. In 946, Shi Chonggui launched a punitive expedition, commanded by the generals Du Wei (the husband of one of Shi Jingtang's sisters) and Li Shouzhen, but Emperor Taizong defeated and then induced Du and Li Shouzhen to surrender to him. He then attacked south. With nearly the entire Later Jin army given to Du and Li Shouzhen for the expedition, Kaifeng was defenseless, and Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  After Later Jin's destruction  After Emperor Taizong entered Kaifeng, he claimed to be the emperor of China (i.e., the former Later Jin realm) as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Meanwhile, the wife of the Liao general Zhao Yanshou (who was previously a Later Tang general — having married a daughter of Li Siyuan's (sister of Li Congyi's), the Princess of Yan — but who had served Liao ever since his capture by Emperor Taizong in the campaign of Later Tang's destruction) had died by this point, and Emperor Taizong thus wanted to give Princess Yong'an to Zhao in marriage as his next wife. As her mother, Consort Dowager Wang went to Kaifeng for the ceremony. When Emperor Taizong saw her, he, claiming that he and Li Siyuan had previously agreed to be blood brothers, bowed to her, greeting her as a sister-in-law. Meanwhile, Liu Suining (), whose father, the Later Liang general Liu Xun, had been Consort Dowager Wang's master, asked her to intercede for him to ask for a military governorship, and she did. Emperor Taizong thus commissioned Liu Suining as the military governor of Anyuan Circuit (安遠, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei). He also commissioned Li Congyi as the military governor of Weixin Circuit (威信, headquartered in modern Heze, Shandong) and created Li Congyi the Prince of Xu. Believing that Li Congyi was still too young, Consort Dowager Wang declined the opportunity to have him report to the post, and took him back to Luoyang. Emperor Taizong, despite his desire to rule over the former Later Jin realms, treated it poorly, allowing his soldiers to pillage the realm. This led to many armed rebellions against him, and he, troubled by the situation, decided to head back to Khitan territory, leaving his brother-in-law Xiao Han in charge at Kaifeng. He became ill on the way, and died near Heng Prefecture (恆州, in modern Shijiazhuang), plunging the succession into a battle between his nephew Yelü Ruan (supported by the army that attacked south, and who then declared himself emperor, as Emperor Shizong) and his brother Yelü Lihu (supported by his mother Empress Dowager Shulü). Xiao wanted to abandon Kaifeng himself, particularly with one of the rebellion leaders, the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan (who had declared himself the emperor of a new Later Han) bearing down toward Luoyang and Kaifeng, but feared that, with Han rebellions already overtaken the realm, if he simply abandoned Kaifeng, he might be caught in such a disturbance that he could not withdraw safely. He sent the officer Gao Mohan () to Luoyang under the name of the deceased Emperor Taizong, summoning Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi to Kaifeng. Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi tried to hide themselves at Li Siyuan's tomb, but were discovered by Gao and his soldiers and forced to report to Kaifeng. Once there, Xiao declared Li Congyi emperor and, after leaving some of the soldiers from Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing, ceded by Shi Jingtang to Liao in appreciation of its support of him) to help defend Kaifeng, departed. Consort Dowager Wang realized that this left her and Li Congyi in a disastrous position, and when the officials left at Kaifeng greeted her, she wept and stated, \\"We, mother and son, are left in such a vulnerable position, but you, lords, pushed us to this position; this will bring disaster on our household!\\" She tried to firm up Kaifeng's defenses by summoning Gao Xingzhou the military governor of Guide Circuit (歸德, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan) and Wu Xingde () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), but neither paid her any heed. She, in fear, stated to the officials, \\"We, mother and son, had been forced by Xiao Han into destruction. But you, lords, are sinless. You should quickly welcome the new emperor to seek your own fortune. Do not worry about us!\\" The officials were touched by her, and none left. When she subsequently consulted them, some advocated resisting Liu, arguing that if they could hold out for a month, Liao would send reinforcements. Consort Dowager Wang, however, believed that resistance would be useless and that a siege would be disastrous to the people of Kaifeng, and therefore resolved to surrender. She thus had Li Congyi, using the lesser title of Prince of Liang, submit a petition welcoming Liu to Kaifeng, and they moved out of the palace into a private residence. This overture, however, could not save her or Li Congyi. Liu subsequently entered Luoyang and, receiving the petition, sent his officer Guo Congyi () to Kaifeng with instructions to kill Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi. As Consort Dowager Wang was facing death, she wept and stated, \\"My son was put into this position by the Khitan. What crime did he have to deserve death? Why not allow him to live, such that each year, at Cold Food Festival, he could sacrifice a bowl of wheat grains to the tomb of Emperor Mingzong?\\" It was said that whoever heard of what she said were touched to weep for their fate.

He authored two seminal works Et si les OVNIs n’existaient pas? (And What if UFOs don’t exist?)(1977) and Le naufrage des Extra-terrestres (The Shipwreck of the Extraterrestrials)(1979) Prior to this, he was a member of the editorial board of Lumières dans la Nuit, France’s most respected ufo magazine, but was fired after the second book was published.Jacques Scornaux, “The Rising and Limits of a Doubt” Magonia #15, April 1984, pp. 3-6; http://magonia.haaan.com/2009/doubt/ Research One of the primary findings that prompted Monnerie’s advance of the PSH was the fact that IFO reports seem to contain all the same narrative elements as unsolved reports, even purported physical interactions with the environment such as engine-stoppages and animal reactions. There was no firm way to predict how a case will break upon investigation by what was present in the report. There was a clear continuum between the trivial and extraordinary, an observation reinforced and amplified in Hilary Evans’s writings on entity phenomena.Hilary Evans, Visions, Apparitions, Alien Visitors, Aquarian, 1984.Hilary Evans, Gods, Spirits, Cosmic Guardians: Encounters with Non-Human Beings, Aquarian Press, 1987. Monnerie’s ideas include the suggestion that many high strangeness ufo experiences involve a waking dream, sometimes triggered by an external stimulus of the sort responsible for IFO reports that creatively works up and produces an experiential narrative involving projections of mental images and materials that the experiencer holds personally and/or culturally significant.Hilary Evans, Visions, Apparitions, Alien Visitors, Aquarian, 1984, p. 266. The dreamer is influenced by the prevailing myths of his time, particularly those carrying the sanction of widespread social acceptance – an authorized myth.Hilary Evans, Visions, Apparitions, Alien Visitors, Aquarian, 1984, p. 285. Universal psychological archetypes are also part of the psychological process shaping such experiences. Hilary Evans expressed doubts that archetypal processes shape most UFO sightings and experiences. It cannot have a dominant role in creating the UFO phenomenon as seen in UFO databases in part because it is the vast diversity of forms seen there that drives theorists to despair.Hilary Evans, “The Myth of the Authorised Myth,” Magonia #16, July 1984, pp. 15-16; http://magonia.haaan.com/2009/myth/ It must be noted this amounts to a quibble since Evans elsewhere pointed out that such diversity also plays havoc with the theory that UFOs involve real spacecraft piloted by real extraterrestrials visiting here from interstellar distances.Hilary Evans, The Evidence for UFOs, Aquarian Press, 1983, p. 137. It only requires a theoretical tweak that the dreaming process be only loosely constrained by such shaping processes within the dream producer and that drives for creative difference and individual predilections shaped by personal history are also part of the mix that eventually form the narrative of UFO encounter experiences.

It was built in 1893 to serve passenger traffic on the Housatonic Railroad, which operated the tracks that run through the town between Pittsfield to the north and Connecticut to the south. It served as the town's main passenger station until passenger service was terminated in 1971 by the Penn Central Railroad, the NYNH&H;'s successor. In 1976 the building was converted to office use, and in 1981 it was rehabilitated and opened as a restaurant. It also serves excursions of the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 as Lee Station. Description and history Lee station is located in the village center of Lee, on the west side of Railroad Street at its junction with Elm Street, one block west of Main Street (United States Route 20). It is set parallel to railroad tracks running north-south to its west, which roughly parallel the Housatonic River further west. The station is a single-story wood frame structure, set on a brick basement that is exposed on the track side due to sloping terrain. The exterior is finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and bands of shingles in the Queen Anne style. The street facade has ten asymmetrically placed bays, eight of which have windows and two have doors. The main entrance is located in one of the central bays. The track facade has nine bays, with a central projecting section which originally housed the agent's office. The station was built in 1893 by the Housatonic Railroad shortly before it was absorbed by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H;). It served as a combination station, serving both passengers and freight. In peak mid-20th century years of passenger service, the Berkshire, Housatonic, Litchfield, Mahaiwe, Mahkeenac, Taconic, Umpachanee, and unnamed trains made stops at the station on trips between New York City and Pittsfield.New Haven Timetable, April 24, 1955, Table 11 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Haven_Railroad_1955_timetable.pdf Passenger service ended in 1971 and freight service ended in 1973. The railroad played an important role in the town's economy, bringing its manufactured goods (principally paper) and raw materials to market, and bring vacationers to the area's summer estates and boarding houses. It was the busiest station on the line between the major stops of Pittsfield, Massachusetts and Bridgeport, Connecticut. The station, considered surplus by the Penn Central, was sold to private owners in 1976, who first operated a real estate business there, before converting it to a restaurant in 1981.

The ISI has reportedly been suspicious about CIA's attempted penetration of Pakistani nuclear assets, and CIA's alleged intelligence gathering in the Pakistan's tribal areas along the Afghan border. Based on these suspicions, it was speculated that the ISI was pursuing counter- intelligence against CIA operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ISI former DG Ashfaq Parvez Kayani is also reported to have said, \\"real aim of U.S. [war] strategy is to denuclearize Pakistan.\\" 2010s According to a report by The New York Times, FBI officials tracking the activities of Pakistani spies in the United States have claimed that the ISI actively monitors the Pakistani American community. The objective is to extract information from Pakistanis living in the United States and to specifically keep a check on any elements that are openly critical of the Pakistani government. In one such incident, Mohammad Tasleem, an attaché posted at the Pakistan consulate in New York, had been identified as a clandestine ISI operative who had been posing as an FBI agent to collect information from members of the Pakistani community, in what was described as an ISI campaign to keep tabs on the Pakistani diaspora community. When the matter came to light following an FBI tip-off to Leon E. Panetta, the director of the CIA at that time, a \\"tense conversation\\" had reportedly taken place between the directors of the two intelligence agencies in April 2010. According to the report, \\"Within days, Mr. Tasleem was spirited out of the United States — a quiet resolution typical of the spy games among the worlds's powers\\". U.S. diplomats in Pakistan have claimed being intimidated or harassed frequently. One American official described harassment occurring in the form of vehicles of American diplomats being constantly stopped and thoroughly checked by Pakistani security personnel, and pressure against the construction of American consulates. These actions particularly came into the limelight during the director-generalship of Ahmad Shuja Pasha, in his final year in the backdrop of the Osama bin Laden operation. Pasha reportedly adopted a hostile stance on Washington, cutting down the ISI's cooperation, jailing Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani informant who whistleblew Osama bin Laden's alleged presence to the CIA, \\"ordering the harassment of U.S. diplomats in Pakistan\\" among other things. ISI allegedly blew the cover of the CIA station chief in Islamabad in 2010 by filing a lawsuit naming the CIA station chief Jonathan Banks. The lawsuit was filed by a drone victim who alleged that CIA was killing innocent civilians using its drone program. Following this Banks was recalled. In 2013, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf a political party that also runs the government in the Pakistani North Western province Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lodged a complaint against CIA director John O. Brennan and Islamabad station chief Craig Osth for aiding in the drone attack at Hangu District on 21 November 2013. ISI operative Mohammed Tasleem, an attache in the New York consulate, was found by the FBI in 2010 to be issuing threats against Pakistanis living in the United States, to prevent them from speaking openly about Pakistan's government. US officials and Pakistani journalists and scholars say the ISI has a systematic campaign to threaten those who speak critically of the Pakistan military. Pakistani political academic Ayesha Siddiqa has controversially claimed that the ISI has infiltrated US think tanks. According to Siddiqa, a Pakistani diplomat had confided that the ISI set up funds to infiltrate think tanks in Washington, D.C. and had \\"finally did it\\".

The intelligence agency has been portrayed in a nemesis role in the games.

Premise  After a pharmaceutical company develops a new wonder drug, its customers turn into zombies. T. K. Kane, a mysterious outsider, arrives in a community terrorized by local warlord Adam. Kane protects the community and hunts down the zombies plaguing the community.  Cast  * Frank Farhat as T. K.

Bonilla believed that zombies created from a defective drug would allow for a wide variety of effects on people, and allowed him to write in both feral and intelligent zombies. The cast and crew were mainly made up of people with no experience in filmmaking. Scenes were shot at the Bluegrass Aspendale housing project in Lexington, Kentucky. Bonilla's wife Tammy is the executive producer.  Release  Zombie Planet was distributed by J. R. Bookwalter's Tempe Entertainment. It was released on DVD on October 19, 2004.  Reception  Peter Dendle called the film \\"epically awful\\" and embarrassing for Lexington natives. David Johnson of DVD Verdict said that the film is better than most Z movies, but its length leads to too much filler.

It is the last remnant of the estate of Lemuel Milk, who once owned over of land. History Lemuel Milk moved to Kankakee, Illinois from New York around 1855. An early settler to the area, Milk was among the first to drain the Kankakee region for farming. By purchasing cheap, swampy land for draining, Milk was able to amass a large estate exceeding . This made him one of the largest landowners in Illinois. Milk opened a department store in Chebanse in 1868, which he ran until 1883. In 1876, he founded the Waldron Ice Company, harvesting ice from the nearby Kankakee River. Milk was a trustee on the board of the Illinois Eastern Hospital for the Insane. Milk's most ambitious undertaking was the draining of Beaver Lake in Newton County, Indiana.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/200130.pdf The carriage house, built at some point between 1861 and 1868, is the only remaining structure from Milk's large estate. Milk lived in a seventeen-room mansion at the corner of Oak and Indiana Avenues, which has since been demolished. Aside from sheltering his carriage, Milk also used the building to house livestock. The carriage house is now the third-oldest building remaining in Kankakee after the First Baptist Church and the Asbury United Methodist Church Sanctuary. The building was used as a barn until the early 1920s, when it was used as a painting garage. It later became a warehouse for Fred Swannell Sr.'s hardware store. The building was converted to a bakery and restaurant in 1973. The restaurant quickly went out of business and the building became a meeting place for civic groups. On June 4, 1979, the carriage house was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The carriage house is built with locally quarried limestone. The roof features a cupola with a weather vane, placed at the crossing of the two gables. The building is largely undecorated except for a wide bracketed cornice. The interior retains its rough cut roof trusses. The floor was changed to concrete in the 1920s.

Career Prager began her photography practice after viewing an exhibition of William Eggleston's at the Getty Museum which was on view between 1999 and 2000. Her staged color photographs are described by Ken Johnson as being influenced by Cindy Sherman, Philip- Lorca diCorcia and Douglas Sirk.Ken Johnson (March 19, 2010), Aipad Photography Show New York The New York Times. MoMA curator Roxana Marcoci has described Prager's work as \\"intentionally loaded,\\" saying \\"it reminds me of silent movies— there is something pregnant, about to happen, a mix of desire and angst.\\" Michael Govan the director of LACMA has said that \\"Prager's photographic and filmic compositions, like Eggleston's photographs, Alfred Hitchcock's films, and Edward Hopper's paintings, reveal the extraordinary lurking within the ordinary. Wreaking havoc with our involuntary voyeurism and our tendency to leap to conclusions about people's characters based on the merest details of their appearances, Prager cues our own fantasies by representing her own.\\" In 2005, Prager created a group of works, The Book of Disquiet, as an exhibition and joint publication with artist Mercedes Helnwein. She began to gain more attention after exhibiting Polyester in 2007, which focused on what is now described as her signature cinematic styled portraits set in Los Angeles. Her next series, The Big Valley, was shown in 2008 at Michael Hoppen Gallery in London and in 2009 at Yancey Richardson Gallery in New York. In 2010 Prager exhibited Week-End at M+B Gallery in Los Angeles, Yancey Richardson Gallery and Michael Hoppen Gallery where she debuted her first short film, Despair alongside a group of photographs. Despair was conceived in London during The Big Valley Exhibition, where viewers were inquiring what happened before and after to the subjects in her photographic work. The film starring Bryce Dallas Howard was a full-sensory version of Prager's photographs in motion, showing the before, now and after of one of her images. Her intention was to create pure, cinematic melodrama through the use of an array of artistic mediums – imagery, motion, color, sculpture, painting and sound.Prager's Despair was included in Museum of Modern Art's exhibition \\"New Photography 2010\\" where she was recognized as a notable emerging talent. A pivotal moment for Prager came in 2011 when Kathy Ryan, director of Photography for The New York Times Magazine commissioned her to shoot 12, 1 minute films with some of 2011's stand-out film actors inspired by \\"cinematic villainy\\". Prager won an Emmy for her Touch of Evil short films. In 2012, Prager addressed themes of disaster and spatial turbulence with the series Compulsion. exhibited at M+B Gallery and Yancey Richardson Gallery. Prager's short film La Petite Mort starring French actress Judith Godreche with narration from Gary Oldman was shown alongside the body of work. The film was a \\"contemplation on death\\" and \\"a way for [her] to deal with the hopelessness [she] was feeling about the world. Creating a parallel universe where tragedies happen but with a sense of lightness as well.\\" Prager's series, Face in the Crowd, debuted at Washington D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery of Art in 2013 followed by a solo exhibition at Lehmann Maupin in New York. Prager was commissioned by the Paris Opera in 2015 to create a film for 3e Scène. The film, La Grande Sortie, explores the tension between a performer's experience on stage and the audience watching. It stars Émilie Cozette and features leading dancer Karl Paquette dancing to an adapted score by Nigel Godrich. The film was produced by Jeremy Dawson. La Grande Sortie premiered at 3e Scène on September 15, 2015. followed by solo exhibitions by Prager at Galerie des Galeries in Paris followed by solo exhibitions by Prager at Galerie des Galeries in Paris and in 2016 at Lehmann Maupin in New York, alongside a new set of photographic works.

Early life and family  Darius Miller was born in 1859 in Princeton, Illinois, the son of John S. and Elizabeth H. Miller. He was educated in his home town; in 1882, he married Sue C. Brown of Morris, Illinois. In 1910, Miller and his wife Sue were living in Chicago. Thorndale Manor, which was designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw and built in Lake Forest, Illinois, in 1916, was originally built for Miller. The home was owned from the 1940s until 2001 by the family of Ronald P. Boardman.  Railroad career  Miller's railroad career began in 1877, at the age of 18, as a stenographer for the Michigan Central Railroad. In 1880 he changed jobs to be a clerk for the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in that company's freight office. He was promoted in 1881 to be chief clerk to the general manager, holding this position for two years. Miller changed jobs again in 1883 to become the general freight and ticket agent for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad; he held that position until 1887 when he was promoted to general freight and passenger agent. Two years later in 1889, Miller became the traffic manager for the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railroad. Miller made another change in 1890 to become traffic manager for the Queen and Crescent Road, holding that position until late 1893. At that time he was appointed as traffic manager for the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (MKT); he was promoted to vice president in November 1896. In October 1898 he left the MKT to become second vice president of Great Northern Railway, serving in that position until 1902 when he became first vice president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;). He was appointed president of both the CB&Q; (succeeding George Harris) and the Colorado and Southern Railway in 1910. In 1913 Miller drafted sample legislation against trespassing on railroad property, which he then submitted to the governors and railroad commissions of the states through which the CB&Q; operated. Miller cited a total of 51,083 deaths following trespassing on railroad property in 1911 as part of the reasoning behind the sample legislation; he proposed fines ranging from $10 to $100 or jail terms of up to 30 days per infraction. After his death in 1914, Miller was succeeded as president by Hale Holden.  Death and burial  While on a vacation at Glacier Park, Montana, with his wife Sue, Darius Miller reportedly collapsed on August 22 from what was soon revealed to be appendicitis. Special emergency trains carrying physicians, railroad officials and family members were dispatched from St. Paul, Seattle and Great Falls, Montana, and Miller received an operation to treat the condition on August 23, but Miller died from the original injury on Sunday, August 24, 1914. His funeral was held on August 27, 1914, with a large number of railroad presidents and prominent Chicago businessmen serving as honorary pallbearers. These included: :A. F. Banks, W. G. Bierd, J. H. Carroll, E. F. Carry, W. P. Clough, A. J. Earling, Howard Elliott, Samuel Morse Felton, Jr., Samuel W. Fordyce, W. A. Garnder, Jule Murat Hannaford, George Harris, James J. Hill, Louis W. Hill, W. V.

Reynolds, Edward Payson Ripley, T. Schumacker, John G. Shedd, S. C. Scotten, O. N. Spencer, J. B. Terbell, J. J. Turner, Frederick Douglas Underwood, Daniel Willard and B. M. Winchell The active pallbearers were all executives of the CB&Q.; Miller was interred in an Egyptian Revival- style mausoleum at Rosehill Cemetery. Although some websites include him as part of the expedition that opened King Tut's tomb, his death in 1914 and the date of the tomb discovery in 1922 would disprove this assertion. In honor of Miller, CB&Q; officials donated land in Princeton, Illinois, where Miller was born and raised, to the city of Princeton; the land formed the basis of Darius Miller Park. The park is adjacent to the current Princeton station served by Amtrak.

It is endemic to Kenya, where it is only found in severely fragmented montane forests in Taita Hills in the south-eastern part of the country. Originally Callulina was thought to be monotypic and widely distributed through Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and in southern Kenya. However, within the last decade eight new species has been identified, many which are considered critically endangered by IUCN. C. dawida was described in 2009 by a team led by Simon Loader; it received its specific name after Dawida language, which is spoken in Taita Hills.  Description  Callulina dawida is a medium-sized frog in which females can reach 55 mm and males 35 mm. The toes of the hind feet are arranged in two opposable groups, with the fourth and fifth together, pointing backward when walking on the forest floor. The skin is warty and dorsal adult colour is variable from light brown, grey, dark brown, orange to yellowish. In terms of colouration there is no well-marked sexual dimorphism. Males have larger tympanum than females.  Habitat  Callulina dawida is a high-elevation species occurring in indigenous forest fragments above 1400 m (4600 ft) within Dawida and Mbololo blocks of the Taita Hills. The species is most abundant in the high altitude, but is absent in typical farmland and plantation habitats. Callulina dawida is most active during the warm months of January to March and August to October and less so during the cold months of June and July. They are also less active during the peak rainy seasons in April and November/December, and especially in July, which is the coldest month in the Taita Hills. Callulina dawida is a solitary species. Movement is limited in this species justifying its survival in tiny forest patches. The frogs are good climbers and may perch higher than 1 m on tree stems.  Breeding  Callulina dawida start breeding with calls mainly during the long dry season from around July. The call is a fast repeated “brrr brr brr...”, with the peak frequency at 1.6 kHz. Then egg clutch is deposited on leaf litter nests in September and the mother broods them for three months until November. Callulina dawida, like other brevicipitids, deposit relatively small clutches of large yolk-rich eggs that are buffered by infertile jelly- filled egg capsules, possibly to prevent the fertile eggs from desiccation during the dry period. Eggs hatch at different times and the young ones immediately leave the nest site. After hatching around November the froglets are grown-up enough to move around and be easily detected in January and February. Callulina dawida reaches sexual maturity within eight months of hatching.  Conservation  Callulina dawida has been evaluated by IUCN as a critically endangered species because its small and fragmented range and ongoing deterioration and loss of its habitat. There are plans to replant several pine and eucalyptus plantations with native tree species.

Biography  Lev Razumovsky was born in Leningrad, USSR on May 1, 1926. He survived the Siege of Leningrad. In 1943, aged 17, he was drafted to the army, was seriously wounded in a battle near Petrozavodsk losing his left arm. In 1945, despite his disability, he entered the Leningrad College of Art and Design (now the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy) to become a sculptor. His diploma work, the Pilot (cast bronze, 1953), was installed in Victory Park in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg. In 1955, Razumovsky was admitted to the Union of Artists of Russia. In sculpture, he worked in various genres: monuments, park sculpture, portraits, compositions, small-size sculpture, and medals. War and the Holocaust were major themes in his work. Five sculptures by Lev Razumovsky have been acquired by the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg. Bulat Okudzhava wrote a letter to Lev Razumovsky about his sculpture composition \\"The Roads of War\\" (1980): Lev Razumovsky was a professional toy designer: his toys were produced in large quantities by toy factories of Leningrad and Moscow. He took part in numerous exhibitions – local, national and international. His works are displayed in Russian museums and in private collections in Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Israel, and the US. His memoirs about the siege and the army were published in the 1990s. He has also written about 100 short stories. In 1997, a video was made by Alexander Gref where Lev demonstrates self-invented devices helping one-armed people to manage in everyday life without having to ask someone for help. Initially, this video was meant as an aid for disabled people. In 2011, it was used for a short documentary Life of Full Value.

It is closely associated with University College London (UCL) and in partnership with the UCL Institute of Child Health, which it is located adjacent to, is the largest centre for research and postgraduate teaching in children’s health in Europe. It is part of both the Great Ormond Street Hospital/UCL Institute of Child Health Biomedical Research Centre and the UCL Partners academic health science centre. Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust became a foundation trust on 1 March 2012. Criticism In 2009, Great Ormond Street Hospital was criticised for their role in Baby P's death. Consultant paediatrician Kim Holt and three colleagues wrote to Great Ormond Street Hospital managers in 2006, a year before Baby P's death warning that understaffing and poor record keeping posed a serious risk to patients' safety at St Anne's clinic in Haringey, north London. Kim Holt said bosses ignored her warnings and removed her from the clinic. Dr Kim Holt told in an interview the hospital offered her £120,000 to withdraw her complaints in the wake of Peter's death, a claim the hospital denied. In 2011, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Haringey primary care trust issued an apology to Dr Holt stating \\"Both Trusts accept and are sorry that you have been through a difficult time. You are a respected and valued member of staff and we look forward to you resuming your role in community paediatrics very soon\\".Butler, Patrick. \\"Great Ormond Street hospital issues apology to Baby P whistleblower\\",The Guardian, London, 14 June 2011. In 2014, following a BBC documentary into Baby P's case, Great Ormond Street Hospital released a statement stating they have publicly apologised for their failings and have worked since to make sure improvements were made. The hospital takes its responsibility in the safeguarding of children's safety and welfare very seriously.GOSH statement. \\"GOSH statement in response to BBC one Baby P Documentary\\", NHS, London, 27 October 2014. In April 2012, BBC One London broadcast a documentary called \\"Great Ormond Street Hospital\\", presented by Tim Donovan, which explained how the trust is facing accusations that it is downgrading child protection work and \\"victimising\\" staff who raise concerns.Great Ormond Street Hospital 'victimising concerned staff' \\"Great Ormond Street Hospital\\" - BBC One London documentary 18 April 2012 The hospital posted a detailed response stating that \\"the allegations in this programme are not correct and the programme does not provide a balanced position\\".Response to BBC London programme Research The hospital works with the UCL Institute of Child Health, and is the largest centre for research into childhood illness outside the United States and Canada, and a major international trainer of doctors and nurses.

All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. An informatics hub, called DRIVE (Digital, Research, Informatics and Virtual Environments), was launched in October 2018 in partnership with University College London. Patients at the hospital are said to be digital natives who will naturally embrace the technology. One proposal is a recreation of the hospital in Minecraft so that patients can virtually explore it before they actually visit. Private patients The trust increased private income by 18.9% from 2014 to 2016, a total of £43 million. 80% of its private patient income comes from overseas. Income rose to £55.2 million in 2106/7. In July 2017 £24.4 million was overdue from patients based abroad, mostly in cases of sponsorship by a government or other international organisation. £1.5 million was owed by the Saudi Health Office and £2.7 million by the Kuwaiti Health Office. The trust sued the Libyan Government for £1.5 million in unpaid bills in September 2017. In June 2019 it was owed a total of £45.9 million for international private patient work after increasing international private work, most of which comes through embassies based in London, by 9.1% to £62.3 million in 2018-19. It plans to continue increasing by 10% a year with “marketing road shows” in China, Russia and India. Performance It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 3652 full time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 2.63%. 84% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 73% recommended it as a place to work. In February 2016 it emerged that the trust had not properly recorded waiting time information for patients in the outpatient, surgical and diagnostic divisions. The waiting list grew from 2,000 to more than 9,000 as a result.

There are about 150 brothels in Oahu alone. Legal situation Under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 712-1200, both the buying and selling of sex are illegal, and also related activities such as soliciting, promoting prostitution and allowing premises to be used for prostitution, are prohibited. The penalty is a fine of up to and/or up to 30 days imprisonment. It was legal for Law Enforcement Officers to have sex with prostitutes if they were 'collecting evidence' of prostitution. A new law in 2014 outlawed this practice. A Bill was put before Hawaii's state government in January 2017, with the intent of decriminalising prostitution. On the second reading it was referred to the \\"House Committee on Judiciary\\" for further investigation and the case was adjourned sine die. History Prior to European contact, there was no prostitution on the islands. Polygamy was common and there was no need for prostitutes. Once European sailors started to come to the island and offered money or goods for sex to the native women, prostitution started. The dock area of Iwilei grew into a red-light district. A law was passed in 1835 that prohibited \\"illicit connections,\\" including prostitution. This was soon followed by a \\"Law Respecting Lewdness\\". In 1860, the \\"Act to Mitigate the Evils and diseases arising from Prostitution\\" was passed. It required registration and periodic medical examinations for prostitutes. By the 1900s, Iwilei had become a closed stockade, its 5 entrances controlled by police. Inside there were brightly coloured houses where the prostitutes worked. Many of the prostitutes were Japanese. In 1898 there were 26 Hawaiian, 5 half-caste, 8 French, 2 British, 1 American and 115 Japanese prostitutes registered. Iwilei lasted until May 1917, when it was closed down due to pressure from moralists. The \\"bawdy houses\\" soon set up in Chinatown. An era of unofficial regulation followed, which was endorsed by the US military. There were struggles between the police and military, neither wanting to be seen as being in charge of the red-light district. During the early 1940s the area served 250,000 men per month, at a fixed fee of . On August 28, 1942, the prostitutes of Hotel Street (the main street of the red-light district) went on strike for better conditions and the right to work away from the brothels. The strike lasted 22 days. The best- known prostitute of the period was Jean O'Hara. She is credited with inventing the \\"bull pen\\" system where a single prostitute would work three rooms in rotation: In one room a man would be undressing, in a second room the prostitute would be having sex, and in the third room the man would be dressing. With price controls circumventing the laws of supply and demand, O'Hara's system sped up the process and allowed each prostitute to see many more 'johns' every day. O'Hara later wrote her memoirs in My Life as a Honolulu Prostitute. Following pressure from various groups, Hawaii's Governor, Ingram Stainback, ordered the closure of the red-light district. On September 21, 1944, all the houses of prostitution were ordered to close. Sex trafficking Hawaii is a source, destination and transit country for sex trafficking. Women from China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Russia and parts of Eastern Europe are trafficked to the island and forced into prostitution. Many are moved on to cities on the American mainland after a few months. Hawaiian women and girls are vulnerable to sex trafficking. In 2017 a Chinese national was convicted of trafficking. He brought in Chinese women to work in the Mayflower and Empire Relax massage parlors in Honolulu. He also trafficked women to work in massage parlors in New York City. The Chinese owner of the Mayflower was convicted of attempting to bribe Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. Both faced deportation. In January 2018, an American male was charged with prostitution and sex trafficking offences. He had \\"recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, advertised, maintained, patronized, and solicited\\" by force and threats.

From 2012 to 2017 he was the Nuffield Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford and a professorial fellow of Nuffield College. He is considered one of the world's leading experts in the fields of Choice Modelling, structural modelling, simulation estimation, and panel data econometrics. He is also one of the world's leading economists by many measures of research productivity.And, according to the IDEAS/RePEc October 2013 rankings of economists by several measures of research productivity, he ranks 110th among all economists in the world, 5th in the United Kingdom, 37th in the world over the past 10 years, and 1st among all economists in the 1990 PhD cohort. In terms of total journal pages, weighted by journal impact factors and number of co-authors, he is 23rd in the world and 5th in the world over the last 10 years. Keane works in numerous areas including labor economics, econometrics, consumer demand models, marketing, industrial organization, health economics, and trade. He is currently a chief investigator of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (Cepar). From 2006–10 he was Co- Director of the Centre for the Study of Choice (CenSoC) at UTS. Keane became a dual citizen of Australia in 2010. Education and career Keane was born in Suffern, New York, United States, and graduated from Xavier High School in Manhattan in 1979. He received a B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, and a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1990. In 1993, he became a tenured associate professor at the University of Minnesota, and was promoted to full professor in 1996. He subsequently held full professor positions at New York University (1998–2001) and Yale University (2000-2006). In 2006, he moved to Australia to take up an Australian Federation Fellowship at the University of Technology Sydney. In 2011, he became an Australian Laureate Fellow at the University of New South Wales. Keane was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society (2005), to the Council of the Econometric Society (2009), and a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia (2012). He was the recipient of the John D.C. Little award for the Best Paper in Marketing (1996) and the Kenneth J. Arrow Award for Best Paper in Health Economics (2008). In 2004–05, Keane was the Goldwater Chair of American Institutions at Arizona State University and, subsequently, has been a regular visiting professor there. Contributions Keane's work is notable for the fact that it spans a very wide range of substantive and methodological areas. He is best known for work on the following topics: Discrete choice models Keane's work on recursive importance sampling (the \\"GHK\\" algorithm), contained in his thesis (1990) and published in 1993–1994, made it feasible to estimate a much larger class of discrete choice models than was previously possible. In particular, his thesis developed a fast algorithm for the highly accurate calculation of areas of polyhedrons in very-high-dimensional spaces. While primarily a result in applied mathematics, this result is very useful in economics (and other social sciences) because the choice probabilities in discrete choice models generally have this form.See Skrondal, Anders and Sophia Rabe-Hesketh (2004), \\"Generalized Latent Variable Modeling,\\" London: Chapman & Hall/CRC, pp. 173–4, where they state \\"In econometrics the GHK simulator is very popular for models with multi-normal latent responses, for instance probit panel (longitudinal) models (e.g., Keane, 1994, Geweke, et al., 1994). This is probably because the simulator has been shown to outperform other simulators although it is relatively easy to implement.\\" The GHK algorithm is now included in many popular econometrics software packages, including SAS, Stata, GAUSSX, Matlab and R-Cran-Bayesm, and is a standard topic in graduate econometrics texts. Consumer demand and marketing A 1996 paper with Tulin Erdem in Marketing Science presented what is now the main economic model of advertising and consumer learning. This paper received the John D.C. Little Award for the Best Paper in Marketing in 1996, and it has had a major impact on the fields of marketing and industrial organization. There is now a large literature on consumer learning based on the Erdem-Keane framework. Erdem and Keane (among others) have argued that their framework can provide an economic explanation for the phenomenon known as brand equity, based on incomplete information and risk aversion. The November 2013 issue of Marketing Science contains an extensive review of the large literature based on the Erdem-Keane framework. Dynamic life-cycle models In a series of joint papers with Kenneth Wolpin, published between 1994 and 2010, Keane developed a major line of research on dynamic life-cycle models of career (i.e., school and work) choices. This line of research is notable both for the methodological contributions on how to estimate these types of models, and for its substantive economic contributions. Methodologically, their method of approximating the solution to computationally intensive dynamic programming problems led to a great expansion in the class of such models that are feasible to implement empirically (i.e., their method made it possible to estimate models with many more choices and state variables than was possible previously). Substantively, their seminal 1997 paper on \\"The Career Decisions on Young Men\\" presented the so-called \\"90 percent result\\"—i.e., that most of what matters for lifetime earnings has already happened by age 16. This result helped to shift the focus of the human capital literature away from college education and towards early childhood education. This is now a very active area of research in economics, which has been pursued by both Keane and Wolpin and, quite notably, by the Nobel Prize–winning economist James Heckman, among others. Welfare and transfer programs His 1998 paper with Robert Moffitt, entitled \\"Multiple welfare program participation and labor supply,\\" has had great influence on subsequent models of transfer/welfare programs. This was the first paper to account for the very complex budget constraints created when people may participate in several government welfare programs simultaneously. The model predicted that welfare caseloads would drop substantially in response to earnings subsidies (like the Earned Income Tax Credit). Human capital and labor supply Michael Keane at the Becker- Friedman Institute, 2013 In recent years, Keane has argued persuasively that, due to human capital effects, labor supply elasticities are much larger than the previous consensus of the economics profession would suggest. These views are presented in Imai and Keane (2004), Keane (2010) and Keane and Rogerson (2012).Prescott Nobel Lecture, In discussing the long-standing conflict between the typically small empirical estimates of labor supply elasticities and the large elasticities implied by macro models, Prescott (2006) states: \\"Recently, Imai and Keane (2004) resolved the conflict... [they] took into consideration the value of human capital people acquire when working ... This adjustment dramatically increases the estimate of the labor supply elasticity ...\\"Becker-Posner Blog \\"Is Raising Marginal Tax Rates on Higher Income Individuals a Good Idea?\\" July 15, 2012, In discussing Keane and Rogerson (2012), Becker states: \\"... on the job investments in human capital ... bias downwards the micro estimates of labor supply elasticities that are based on variations in hours worked over the lifecycle. This bias is especially large at younger ages where most of these investments occur since the true earnings at these ages is much larger than the observed wages at these ages because younger workers are raising their future wages through investments in their human capital. This bias helps explain why computed elasticities of labor supply are usually greater for older workers ... These and other corrections to simple interpretations of the micro evidence on labor responses to changes in tax rates clearly suggest that aggregate labor responses to tax rates may be quite large.\\" If correct, his views imply that welfare losses from income taxation are much higher than was previously thought. Recently, Keane gave a keynote lecture summarizing this work at the 2015 annual meeting of the Royal Economic Society.http://www.fsmevents.com/res/2015/session02/ His Cowles lecture at the 2011 summer meeting of the Econometric Society also dealt with this topic. Modelling expectations Keane's papers with David Runkle (1990, 1998) are considered fundamental contributions in the literature on how people form expectations. These papers showed that the widespread empirical failure of \\"rational expectations\\" was in fact due to a set of econometric and data problems (such as the failure to account for aggregate economic shocks and the effects of data revisions). Panel data econometrics The recursive importance sampling algorithm developed in Keane's 1994 Econometrica paper made it possible to estimate panel data discrete choice models with complex serial correlation patterns. This approach is now widely used to model discrete dynamic processes in marketing and labor economics. Keane's 1992 Journal of Business and Economic Statistics paper with David Runkle developed a new approach for estimating linear panel data models in cases where the available instruments are predetermined but not strictly exogenous. This is a very common case that includes all dynamic panel data models as a leading example. Chamberlain (1982) noted that the Keane-Runkle approach was not fully efficient because it fails to use all available instruments. Keane and Runkle (1992) responded that the use of additional instruments would be unwise as it would generate bias due to the \\"many instrument problem.\\" Nevertheless, the development of more efficient panel data estimators based on more instruments became a major research program in the 90s. Examples of this line of research are well-known papers by Arellano-Bond (1991), Ahn-Schmidt (1995), Arellano- Bover (1995) and Blundell-Bond (1998). For a review of the literature see Baltagi (2005) chapter 8. More recent work, such as Ziliak (1997), supports Keane and Runkle (1992)'s original argument that use of additional instruments may cause severe bias.See the well-known reference on panel data by Baltagi (2005), pp. 151–52, where he states: \\"Ziliak (1997) performs an extensive set of Monte Carlo experiments for a dynamic panel data model ... Ziliak finds that the downward bias of GMM is quite severe as the number of moment conditions expands, outweighing the gains in efficiency. Interestingly, Ziliak finds that the forward filter 2SLS estimator proposed by Keane and Runkle (1992) performs best in terms of the bias/efficiency tradeoff and is recommended.\\" Econometric methodology Keane is well known as a champion of the \\"structural econometrics\\" school, which emphasizes the important role of economic theory in empirical work. This contrasts with the \\"experimental school\\" which has become very popular in the last 20 years. The latter seeks to use \\"natural experiments\\" to substitute for economic theory. He has written a number of articles on the importance of theory and the limitations of experiments (see Keane 2010a, 2010b).See also the discussion by Other areas In addition, Keane has done significant work in many other areas, such as health economics, child development, international trade, political economy, experimental economics, and development economics.

The byelection was fought due to the resignation of the incumbent Conservative MP, Charles William Nevill. It was won by the Liberal candidate Arthur Cowell- Stepney,http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm who was returned unopposed.British Parliamentary Election Results 1832-1885 (The Macmillan Press 1977), compiled and edited by F.W.S. Craig, page 503 Background A Liberal seat for decades, Carmarthen Boroughs fell to the Conservatives in 1874 when the octogenarian sitting member, Sir John Stepney, stood down. He was succeeded as Liberal candidate by his son, Arthur, who was not regarded as holding radical views. To general surprise he declared his support for policies such as the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Wales. As a result, Charles Nevill, who resisted calls to oppose the elder Stepney in 1868, entered the fray, and was championed as 'one of the largest employers of labour' in the locality. During his short parliamentary career, Nevill did not always support Conservative policy. He voted in favour of the extension of the county franchise, and also supported Osborne Morgan's Burials' Bill. On 19 July 1876, Nevill indicated his intention to resign as an MP, in a letter to the Vicar of Carmarthen, the Rev Latimer M. Jones. Nevill cited his business interests as the main reason for his decision. Candidates A number of possible candidates were initially mentioned, both Conservatives and Liberals. On the Conservative side, Mansel Lewis of Stradey and J.S. Tregoning of Iscoed, Ferryside were mentioned Among the Liberals, potential candidates included Arthur Stepney, W.R.H. Powell of Maesgwynne, who had unsuccessfully contested Carmarthenshire in 1874, B.T. Williams, the Recorder of Carmarthen and Evan Matthew Richards, former member for Cardiganshire. Williams was initially regarded as the most likely candidate. However, Liberals supporters of Arthur Stepney swiftly took action to select a candidate before their political opponents had any opportunity to fully consider their options. On the morning of 31 July, Arthur Stepney travelled to Carmarthen by train, where he was met by a delegation of prominent liberals who held a formal meeting chaired by the Mayor, David Edwards. That same evening a meeting was held in Llanelli, presided over by John Randell, chairman of the Llanelly Local Board of Health, with Stepney being formally adopted. Stepney's actions not only caught his Conservative opponents unawares but also rival aspirants for the Liberal nomination. B.T. Williams was said to have intended to declare his candidature but withdrew to avoid a division in the ranks, while the claims of Lewis Morris were also ignored. It was soon apparent that the Conservatives would not field a candidate, and it does not appear that any potential candidates were considered. Outcome Within a few days it became apparent that Arthur Stepney would be returned unopposed.

The program consist of two major stimulus packages injected in the Thai economy involving vast investments in industry, science, technology, agriculture, logistics and infrastructure, environment, education, labour and tourism and the positive impact remains in the economy up to the present.  Historical context  Thailand became a great exporter almost 200 years ago, mainly to the Southeast Asia and US. The long history in exporting lead to a state, in which more than 60% of Thailand's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) came from export. In July 1997 a financial collapse of the Thai Baht occurred due to lack of foreign currency to support its currency peg to the U.S. dollar. The collapse caused the country to acquire a burden of foreign debts and the country bankrupted. The consequences of the collapse caused the spread of Asian financial crisis. Thailand was not able to fully recover from the Asian crisis, but the GDP grew annually anyway until a global financial crisis occurred in 2008. It struck the Thai economy much less than the previous crisis, mostly because the epicenter of the crisis was the USA and west Europe, but the consequences could have been much worse if the government had not responded with a good investment plan known as Thai Khem Khaeng which spurred the Thai's economy in final value of 400 billion baht in various markets and industry sectors.  Thai Khem Kaeng  In 2009, Thailand's economy was in a state of unstable and distressful consumption as a consequence of great financial crisis. Due to this global crisis, suppliers and consumers worldwide seriously tightened their belts. First-phase stimulus came in Q1 (First quartal), when the administration of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva poured 116 billion baht worth of tax breaks, public utility subsidies, and cash incentives for low- income workers into the economy. These measures, referred as SP1 or Stimulus Package 1, helped spur local consumption. Thailand's economy weathered a difficult period and then climbed out of recession in the second half as investment and consumption improved. Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) nurture along many new projects to invigorate business, with 1 573 project applications submitted in 2009. BOI-approved investment covered a wide spectrum of sectors, from services, transport and industrial estates to electronics, eco-car parts and alternative energy. High-tech businesses engaged in the manufacture of telecommunication parts, semiconductors, HDDs, automotive electronics and many more. On 23 November, the One Start One Stop Investment Center (OSOS) was launched in Bangkok. Its main purpose was to facilitate and speed up the entry of new investors to the markets as well as assist existing businesses to expand within the borders of Thailand and it is a convenient focal point for businesses to ease the dealing with government as their representative up this day. Promotional policies and roadshows conducted during the year helped to bring in FDI. According to a BOI survey made of 576 investors between April and June 2009, none of them aimed to withdraw their investments from Thailand, 30% intend to expand more and the rest wanted to keep projects at current states. Investors also responded that one of the reasons is the attractiveness of the investment incentives, reasonable wages, well-developed infrastructure, and reliable suppliers of materials for the industries, parts and services in the country. The value of investment from China increased tenfold in 2009 and investors from Japan, United States, Europe and ASEAN countries followed. In the third quarter of 2009, the private investment declined by just 12.2% y-o-y, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB). That was a huge decrease in comparison with the 17.8 and 16.1% contractions in Q1 and Q2, respectively. With foreign funds flowing back in the second half of 2009 Thailand's stock market rebounded as well. The stock prices index rose by 57.1% from 2 January to 3 December 2009. A breakdown of various sectors in 2009 shows ups and downs but generally forward movement, especially after the first quarter. Consumer confidence firmed up as the year carried on, with this index rising steadily to hit 74.5 in August 2009 and 75.6 in September. Overall demand expanded throughout the whole year. Vehicle purchases in particular increased for the third consecutive month as employment grew livelier. Healthier consumption can also be seen in the agricultural market as the income improved with higher crop prices. November 2009 is considered a breakpoint month when Thailand recovered from the crisis of past year. Imports in November rose 4.7% from the previous month and contracted just 0.3% y-o-y. Earlier months had double-digit contraction rates. In a move that bodes well for continued growth in consumption, the Central Wage Committee in December increased Thailand's minimum wage. In Bangkok, the new minimum climbed from 203 to 206 baht per day. As in most countries around the world, the job market in Thailand suffered a heavy blow in 2008. Injections of government funding stirred the activity in 2009 and by the third quarter, mostly service businesses and manufacturers of electronics and textile were hiring more staff. The country's unemployment rate decreased to record-breaking 1.1% in November which was the lowest percentage yet, indicating a comeback in progress, as the unemployment rate was 2.1% in Q1. November 2009 also brought back Thailand's incomes from tourism. The number of foreign visitors grew throughout the year, and in Q3 the arrivals had almost reached the levels achieved before the financial crisis took place. In November 2009, 1.37 million foreign tourists came to Thailand, up 13.1% from the previous month. The BOI promoted development of tourism clusters in the country, such as theme parks and cultural centers as examples of facilities and with import duties and corporate tax exemptions to prompt investors. Other opportunities for investment in Thailand's tourism infrastructure included property development in major cities, spas, hotels and short-haul air and sea transport. Many tourists traveled to Thailand for its very affordable surgeries. At the beginning of 2010 a second stimulus package was injected in the economy according to the data gathered through the year 2009. It aimed mostly at Thailand's infrastructure but it could not reach the same impact level as the SP1 had. It is said that the second stimulus package was made partially to increase the popularity of the government at that time. The fact is that the decision making behind it was not as sophisticated as the year before.

Her son Min Hla briefly became king for three months in 1425, following the death of her second husband King Thihathu of Ava. Her first husband was Thihathu's elder brother Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa of the Forty Years' War fame. Her eldest child Minye Kyawhtin was the rebel king of Toungoo (Taungoo) from 1452 to 1459. Brief Saw Min Hla was a daughter of Tarabya I of Pakhan, and sister of Tarabya of Toungoo, who was viceroy of Toungoo from 1440 to 1446. In 1406, she was married to Prince Minye Kyawswa at his coronation ceremony as heir-apparent.The Maha Yazawin chronicle (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 33–34) says that she was married to Minye Kyawswa in 775 ME (29 March 1413 to 28 March 1414), and that she was first married to Letya Pyanchi and then to Sokkate, both viceroys of Prome. But the Yazawin Thit chronicle corrects Maha Yazawin and says that it was a different Saw Min Hla, and that Saw Min Hla of Pakhan was married to Minye Kyawswa in 768 ME (30 March 1406 to 29 March 1407) at his coronation ceremony as crown prince. The Hmannan Yazawin chronicle (Hmannan Vol. 2003: 20–21) follows Yazawin Thit's account, citing other evidence. Minye Kyawswa was a cousin.According to the Toungoo Yazawin chronicle (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 33), she was a niece of King Minkhaung I, which makes her a first cousin of Minye Kyawswa. But the standard chronicles do not mention any relations between her and Minye Kyawswa. She and Minye Kyawswa had four children between 1408 and 1415:(Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 21): The first child Minye Kyawhtin was born in 770 ME (29 March 1408 to 28 March 1409). (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 54): the youngest child was born in 776 ME (30 March 1416 to 29 March 1417). Minye Kyawhtin, Min Hla Htut, Minye Aung Naing and Saw Min Phyu. A year after Minye Kyawswa fell in action, she was made the chief consort of Minye Thihathu, Minye Kyawswa's younger brother and successor as heir- apparent. She had three children with Thihathu: Min Hla, Saw Pyei Chantha and Shwe Pyi Shin Me. In all, she had seven children (three sons and four daughters.) When Thihathu became king in 1421, Saw Min Hla became the chief queen.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 53 But her rank as the chief queen was only nominal. Thihathu also took his father's favorite queen Shin Bo-Me as queen. He spent much time with Bo-Me that Saw Min Hla left the palace for a hall next to the Shwe Zedi Pagoda in the capital, and retired to religion.Harvey 1925: 95 She hence became known as Tanzaung-shin Mibaya တန်ဆောင်းရှင် မိဖုရား).Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 55 Her fifth child Min Hla became king in August 1425 after Thihathu was assassinated in a plot arranged by Shin Bo-Me. Three months later, the eight-year-old king was poisoned by Shin Bo-Me, who put her lover Prince Min Nyo of Kale on the throne.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 59Harvey 1925: 96 Saw Min Hla's eldest child Minye Kyawhtin (also known as Min-nge Kyawhtin) became the rebel king of Toungoo from 1452 to 1459.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 33–35 Notes References Bibliography  * Chief queens consort of Ava ","title":"Saw Min Hla"},{"id":"41233478","text":"The East Aberdeenshire by-election of 1875 was fought on 22 December 1875.

One of these protests, in 1984, led to the shooting of the British police officer Yvonne Fletcher and the subsequent siege of the embassy by armed police. Diplomatic relations with Libya were broken off and were not resumed until 1999, whereupon the embassy was moved to its current location in Knightsbridge. The embassy was again the focus of attention in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War. There were several protests in the early part of the year against the Gaddafi government's crackdown on protesters in Benghazi, culminating in the occupation of the embassy's roof and the swapping of the flag with that of the National Transitional Council (now the current Libyan flag). In July of that year the British government expelled the existing embassy staff and formally recognised the NTC as the sole legitimate authority in Libya.

It pioneered the use of searchlights (S/Ls) for port defence before World War I and for anti-aircraft (AA) defence during the war. In the interwar period it formed the two senior searchlight regiments of the Territorial Army, which defended Southern England during The Blitz. Detachments later served in the Battle of Crete and Siege of Tobruk. The regiment was one of the first to employ women in a combat-related role. Origin Former Drill Hall of the London Electrical Engineers in Regency Street, London SW1 Queen Victoria approved the formation of 'The Electrical Engineers, Royal Engineers (Volunteers)' on 27 April 1897.London Gazette 27 April 1897 Their role was to supplement the regular Royal Engineers (RE) in wartime by operating searchlights to defend major ports in conjunction with minefields controlled by Volunteer companies of Submarine Miners, RE. The headquarters of the new force was at 5 Victoria Street, Westminster, and initially there were four companies recruited in London and the Midlands. By 1908 there were seven 'Divisions' of electrical engineers around the great estuary ports of Britain, including the London Division, which was responsible for the Thames Estuary. The London Electrical Engineers established its HQ at 46 Regency Street, Victoria, in 1900.Keith Brigstock 'Royal Artillery Searchlights', presentation to Royal Artillery Historical Society at Larkhill, 17 January 2007.Osborne, p.p 132–3.Westlake, p. 16. Second Boer War The commanding officer of The Electrical Engineers was Rookes Crompton (1845–1940), the electrical pioneer and founder of Crompton & Co, one of the first large-scale manufacturers of electrical equipment. In earlier life he had been an infantry officer in the Rifle Brigade and the 57th Foot before going onto the Reserve List in 1880,Who Was Who 1920–1940.Hart's Army List, 1890. but had spent much of his service in India designing military steam wagons. Early in the Second Boer War, Colonel Robert Baden-Powell improvised searchlights to deter night attacks during the Siege of Mafeking. Soon afterward Major Crompton led a detachment of the Electrical Engineers Volunteers to South Africa where they operated electric Arc lamp searchlights of his own design, the first use of such equipment by the Royal Engineers on campaign.London Gazette 17 April 1900. The detachment served from April to October 1900 in the Transvaal and Orange Free State.Quarterly Army List Crompton was promoted to lieutenant-colonel,London Gazette 6 November 1900. Mentioned in DispatchesLondon Gazette 10 September 1901. and made a Companion of the BathLondon Gazette 27 September 1901. for his efforts and was later given the honorary rank of colonel.London Gazette, 17 December 1907. Territorial Force Cap badge of the Royal Engineers (George V cypher). Under the Haldane Reforms, the Electrical Engineers RE were converted into Fortress Companies RE in the new Territorial Force. They were responsible, among other duties, for electrical installations in the defended ports. The large London Division was planned to split into six RE companies as follows:London Gazette 20 March 1908 *London (Fortress) Royal Engineers *1st London Divisional Telegraph Company RE *2nd London Divisional Telegraph Company RE *London Wireless Telegraph Company RE *London Cable Telegraph Company RE *London Ballon Telegraph Company RE However, the plan was changed over the next two years. Instead, the London Electrical Engineers retained its title and role, 1st London Divisional Telegraph Company, RE, (as well as the 1st and 2nd London Divisional Field Companies) was found by the East London (Tower Hamlets) RE (V), while the 2nd London Divisional Telegraph Company (as well as 3rd and 4th London Field Companies) was found by the 1st Middlesex RE (V).Lord & Watson, pp. 157, 168–9.London Gazette, 14 October 1910. The London Division was therefore finally reorganised as follows: *London Electrical Engineers *London Wireless Telegraph Company RE *London Cable Telegraph Company RE *London Air-Line Telegraph Company RE *London Balloon Company RE (disbanded 1913) The three telegraph companies formed London District Signals,Lord & Watson, p. 184. while the London Electrical Engineers (LEE) specialised on searchlights. Crompton and most of the other officers appointed to the LEE were Members or Associate Members of the Institution of Civil Engineers.London Gazette, 22 December 1908. Another was the pioneer aeronautical engineer Edward Teshmaker Busk, who was a lieutenant in the corps. Crompton retired in 1910,London Gazette 8 July 1910. but was appointed Honorary Colonel of the corps in 1911.London Gazette 23 June 1911. World War I By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the London Electrical Engineers had grown to six companies based at Regency Street.Monthly Army List.Mark Conrad, The British Army in 1914.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 13–4. Searchlight units were immediately deployed to the South Coast of England and the Thames Estuary to form light barriers against surface raiders. For example, No 2 Company London Electrical Engineers was positioned at Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury.Smith, p. 21. By an agreement between the Admiralty and War Office on 3 September 1914, responsibility for air defence of the UK lay initially with the Royal Navy, which provided aircraft, quick-firing guns and searchlights to defend vulnerable points against the anticipated air raids. These acetylene searchlights were operated by civilian Special Constables.Morris, pp. 22–8. Anti-Aircraft defence The first night raid was made by Zeppelin airships on 19/20 January 1915, then in April and May regular raids began on the East Coast of England, reaching London on 31 May/1 June. Zeppelin raids continued during the summer and autumn of 1915, after which it was decided that the Royal Navy would try to deal with raiders approaching the British coastline, while the Army would be responsible for dealing with them over land. The transfer took effect between February and April 1916. Experience had shown the need for plentiful searchlights to guide both gunners and fighter pilots to their targets. The army established a 25-mile wide searchlight belt stretching from Northumberland to Sussex, with a double ring round London.Morris, pp. 30–59, 81–6, 178–9. The TF began forming AA S/L companies in December 1915, mainly from the LEE and the Tyne Electrical Engineers (TEE). By July 1917 there were 42 AA Companies of the RE scattered around the country, all with the LEE and TEE as their parent units. These included the following LEE units:Short et al., p. 143.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 78. * Nos 1–6 AA Companies, London * Nos 11–12 AA Brigade Searchlight Companies * Nos 20/21 and 24/26 Aeroplane Squadron Searchlight Companies * No 40 AA Company, Dover * No 53 AA Company, Newhaven (The LEE itself had been reduced to five companies by August 1917).Watson & Rinaldi, p. 85. Changes were also needed in searchlight design and training, so a team was selected from the London Electrical Engineers to return to their Headquarters at 46 Regency Street and set up workshops, design and drawing offices to deal with the redesigns. This organisation became The Searchlight Experimental Establishment commanded by Captain P. Yorke, RE. (The TEE similarly took responsibility for the School of Electric Lighting at Gosport.) Technology and tactics developed to keep pace as the Germans replaced vulnerable airships with heavy bombers. New 90 cm and 120 cm electric searchlights and their sound locators were linked directly to the guns to provide early warning.Short et al.. In August 1918, a new establishment was implemented. The London and Tyne Electrical Engineers became the parent units for all coast defence and anti-aircraft Electric Light units and the depots that trained men for them.RE Fortress Companies at Long, Long Trail It was from these that nearly all RE AA companies and AASL companies were formed, serving on Home Defence, with the British Expeditionary Force in France and Flanders, and on the Italian Front.London Cable Signal Company at Great War Forum Between 1915 and 1918, the RE formed 76 AA Searchlight Sections for overseas service. The LEE is known to have found 25 of these: Nos 2 (jointly with Regular RE), 3–5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 25, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45 and 48, together with Nos 21, 23 and 24, which were formed in France from Nos 1-8 AAS sections. Others were formed by the Regular RE (No 1) and by the TEE. The parent units of a further 29 AAS sections are not known, but they probably consisted of mixed LEE, TEE and Medical Category B personnel. A fixed two-light section in France in 1917 comprised 20 men with three vehicles; a mobile three-light section in 1918 consisted of five vehicles and 28 men.Short et al., pp. 206–11. Western Front In August 1915, a detachment of volunteers from the TEE (72 men) and LEE (39 men) proceeded to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. They were formed into 13 small detachments, each assigned to a Field Company of the RE to operate small oxy-acetylene searchlights to detect enemy raiding parties in No-Man's Land. Although these were used with some success for a few months, exposing a light drew heavy fire from the enemy, and the dangerous work earned the detachments the nickname of 'the suicide brigade'.Short et al., pp. 81–2. In November 1915 a joint LEE/TEE company was formed for service in France, designated No 1 (London and Tyne) Electrical & Mechanical Company, RE. It assembled at the LEE's HQ in London, and landed at Le Havre on 15 December, where it was attached to General Headquarters (GHQ) of the BEF. It carried out a variety of duties, ranging from installing electric lighting for hospitals, water pumps and laundry equipment, to erecting a printing works and building a trench locomotive. After the Battle of the Somme it was decided to form an E & M Company for each of the Armies of the BEF and the London & Tyne Company was split to form 351 Company (Second Army) and 354 Company (Fifth Army). 354 Company was later responsible for the development of air-lift and belt water pumps to supply drinking water. During the German Spring Offensive of 1918, 351 and 354 E &M; Companies were entrusted with destroying electrical installations and water supplies ahead of the advancing enemy. These then had to be replaced during the Hundred Days advance.Short et al., pp. 102–18.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 54, 80. Among the professionals who served with the London Electrical Engineers during the war were the electrical engineer Reginald Frankland-Payne Gallwey (who later succeeded as the 5th Baronet of that name)'Frankland-Payne-Gallwey Baronets', Burke's Peerage. and the chemist Theodore Acland. The remaining part-time civilian searchlight operators were also replaced. By the end of the war there were 622 searchlights in use for Home Defence. Interwar The Duke of York's Headquarters This large anti- aircraft effort was quickly scaled down after the Armistice, but the Searchlight Experimental Establishment continued as civilian body, with several officers of the London Electrical Engineers still attached. In 1922 the London Electrical Engineers was split into the 10th and 11th Anti-Aircraft Battalions RE. These were renumbered in 1923 as the 26th and 27th (London Electrical Engineers) Battalion, RE, becoming the two senior searchlight units of the new Territorial Army (Numbers 1–25 were reserved for Regular Army units, but most were never used). 26 AA Battalion, based at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, comprised Nos 301–3 AA Companies, and 27 AA Bn headquartered at Mitcham Lane, Streatham, had Nos 304–6 based at Rochester Row, Westminster. (The Regency Street premises were used by the former London District Signals, which had become Air Defence Signals.) Crompton remained Honorary Colonel of the 27th.Frederick, pp. 858–9, 863–5.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 105, 107–8, 112–4.1 AA Division 1936–38 at British Military History During the 1930s the air defence strength of the Territorial Army was greatly expanded. In December 1935 1st Anti-Aircraft Division was formed to cover London, with 26th and 27th Battalions assigned to 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Group (later Brigade), which shared the Duke of York's Headquarters. With the further expansion of the TA after 1938, each battalion was brought up to a four- company establishment with newly-raised companies, 26th Bn gaining 321 AA Company and 27th Bn receiving 390 AA Company. On 15 December 1938, 26th Battalion transferred its 302 AA Company to 34th (Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion at Greenwich, receiving 339 AA Company in exchange. In September 1938, 26th AA Bde was split in two, the two London Electrical Engineer battalions remaining with 38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade at the Duke of York's Headquarters.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files1 AA Division 1939 at British Military HistoryRoutledge. Table LX, p. 378. World War II 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth Mobilisation The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. By October, 306 AA Co had been moved to the area round the Humber Estuary where it came under the command of 46th (Lincolnshire Regiment) AA Bn in 39 AA Bde. In November the company moved into Grimsby to make that a lighted gun zone. In February 1940, 306 AA Co took over some S/L sites on the East Coast that were positioned to pick up low-flying aircraft laying Parachute mines in the mouth of the Humber.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2272.

Blitz When heavy German night air raids on the UK (The Blitz) began in late summer 1940 the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ) had 73 S/L positions operated by 26th and 27th (LEE) and 75th (Middlesex) S/L Rgts, controlled from a central operations room at Brompton, working directly under HQ No 11 Group, Fighter Command at Uxbridge. 75th S/L operated a 'fixed azimuth' line of S/Ls and sound detectors across the flight paths to the IAZ, while the two LEE regiments cooperated with the HAA guns in the urban area.Routledge, pp. 388–9. The three regiments continued to formed part of 38th AA Brigade under 1st AA Division. Later, as the Blitz continued, 27th (LEE) S/L Rgt moved out to join 47 AA Bde in 5 AA Division, covering Southampton.Farndale, Annex D, p. 257.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.27 SL Rgt at RA 39–45 By the end of the Blitz in May 1941, 26th (LEE) S/L Rgt was still with 38th AA Bde in 1 AA Division with 321 and 339 Btys, while 301 and 303 Btys were detached to 8 AA Division in South West England. Meanwhile, 27th (LEE) S/L Rgt had left AA Command, and from now on the two regiments' histories diverged.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. 26th (Mixed) Searchlight Regiment (London Electrical Engineers) AA Command's formation sign. 26th Searchlight Regiment retained its role of defending London as part of AA Command throughout the war.

A secret trial (the 'Newark Experiment' in April 1941) having shown that women were capable of operating heavy searchlight equipment and coping with conditions on the often desolate searchlight sites, members of the Auxiliary Territorial Service began training to replace male personnel in searchlight regiments. At first they were employed in searchlight Troop headquarters, but on 7 July 1942 the 26th became the first 'Mixed' regiment, with seven Troops of ATS women posted to it, forming the whole of 301 Battery and half of 339 Battery. On 25 October that year, 303 and 339 Btys were listed as Mixed, and the all-women 301 Battery transferred to the new 93rd (Mixed) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery the last searchlight regiment formed, which by August 1943 comprised about 1500 women out of an establishment of 1674.

With the lower threat of attack by the weakened Luftwaffe, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). All Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced in February 1944, and 26th (LEE) S/L Rgt lost 529 Bty, which commenced disbandment on 2 April.

Until late 1942 (when it was joined by a Royal Marines unit) it was the only searchlight regiment in Middle East Forces, and frequently had detachments serving over a wide area.HQ 2 AA Bde War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 169/1560.Joslen, pp. 482, 484–5. =Crete= In May 1941, 304 Battery was detached with other Royal Artillery units from Egypt to Crete, where it operated 20 searchlight projectors in the defence of the Suda Bay area alongside mainly Royal Marine AA gunners (whose own searchlight unit was acting as infantry). German air raids began on 14 May, reaching a peak of intensity on the morning of 20 May, followed by landings by German paratroops and gliders as the Battle of Crete began.Playfair, pp. 125, 131–2 & fn. 7.Crete 1941 at British & Commonwealth Orders of BattleRoutledge, pp. 148–9. On 22 May, at St Matthews Hill near Canea, Battery Serjeant-Major William Egglesfield of 304th S/L Bty called for a volunteer and went out with Gunner L.E.P. Cory to rescue a wounded trooper of the Northumberland Hussars lying wounded in a ravine some 800 yards away. They brought the man back over open ground under fire from snipers.

By 26 May, after continuous German attack from the air and by airborne troops, the defences round Canea finally collapsed and Suda had to be abandoned. The force had to retreat across the island to Sfakia, where the Royal Navy evacuated as many as possible to Egypt. Thousands of British and Commonwealth troops were taken prisoner.Playfair, pp. 141–8. =Tobruk= While the Battle of Crete was progressing, two Troops of 306 Battery were serving with 4 AA Bde in the defence of Tobruk, which resisted months of air attack.Playfair p. 152. Meanwhile, night bombing attacks on British bases in Egypt were common, and two Troops of 390 Battery were guarding Alexandria.Playfair, pp. 298–301. By October 1941, the whole regiment (including the reconstituted 304 Bty) was back in Egypt under the command of 2 AA Bde:Routledge, Table XXII, p. 143. * 304 Bty in the Suez Canal area with 24 x S/Ls * 305 Bty at Port Said and Port Fuad with 24 x S/Ls * 390 Bty less 1 Trp at Suez and Shallufa with 18 x S/Ls * One Trp 390 Bty at Alexandra with 8 x 150 mm S/Ls giving a total of 74 projectors – the only S/Ls then in Egypt. The British Eighth Army advanced again in Operation Crusader, and AA units followed behind.

But there was little to do apart from training with the new Searchlight Control (SLC) radar. In May, 304 Bty returned to Ismailia and 484 Bty went a short way to Quassassin where it came under 21 AA Bde.484 S/L Bty War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 169/16264 By June, the AA defences of the Middle East had been reduced to a 'shell' to protect Alexandria and the Suez Canal. In July the regiment was disposed as follows: * RHQ, 306 and 484 Btys under 17 AA Bde in the Suez Canal area * 390 Bty under 1 AA Bde covering the Levant and Cyprus The following month 484 Bty began to disband (officially it entered 'suspended animation' on 10 September) and most of its personnel were sent to No 2 Depot Regiment, RA, for drafting elsewhere. 390 Battery disbanded on 27 September 1944. 27th (LEE) S/L Regiment and the remaining batteries followed it into suspended animation on 15 June 1945.

The club was founded in 1885. The club fields teams in hurling from underage up to Junior A, and in Gaelic football from underage to Intermediate. Location The club is situated in the half parish of Crecora and in the parish of Manister in central County Limerick. The parishes are situated roughly 15 km south of Limerick City and are near the larger villages of Patrickswell, Croom and Fedamore. Neighbouring clubs include Mungret St. Paul's, Patrickswell, Croom, Banogue, Camogue Rovers, Fedamore and South Liberties. History The club was founded in 1885 and competed in a number of tournaments at that time. In one tournament in Ballyneety, Crecora lost to South Liberties in the final. There was also a recorded match against Liberties in Ballysheedy in 1895. Manister also had its own club during the latter years of the 1800s. The club went in and out of existence over the first half of the 20th century. At times, players from the parishes played with neighbouring clubs. The modern club was established in 1968 and teams competed at junior level although there was still no underage structure. The club started to prosper during the late 1990s and early 2000s when several underage division two titles were won at under 14, 16 and minor. Crecora/Manister won the County Junior B Hurling Championship in 2001 with a win over Ballybricken in the final. They reached the semi finals of the County Junior A Hurling Championships in 2007, but thus far haven't challenged for promotion to intermediate level. Due to the small population of the parishes the club amalgamates with neighbouring clubs such as Fedamore and Croom with some success. Grounds Prior to 1988, the club rented out various fields around the parishes from local farmers for training and matches. In 1988, it located a site about half a kilometre from Crecora village in the townland of Skehanagh in Manister parish. It was blessed and officially opened in 1991 and contained a full sized pitch along with a smaller sized training pitch. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1997-98 and soon after nets and lights were added. A hurling wall was also built in 2010-11.

The by-election, to one of two seats in the House of Commons constituency of Tipperary, arose due to the resignation of the incumbent MP, Charles William White of the Home Rule League. Immediately on news of White's resignation, there was speculation that John Mitchel, the Fenian campaigner, would be a candidate. Mitchel had been convicted of treason in 1848 on the basis of writings which were considered seditious, and sentenced to transportation for 14 years. Sent to Bermuda, he had escaped in 1853 to the United States. On 3 February, he announced that he would sail for Ireland, and issued an election address to the electors of Tipperary, saying he was in favour of Home Rule, total overthrow of the established Church, free education, universal tenant rights, and the freeing of Fenian prisoners. This met with a mixed reception; the Irishman newspaper announced that 'By electing John Mitchel, Tipperary will prove to our rulers that Ireland is neither dead nor dying.' The Daily Express on the other hand insisted that as he was a felon who had broken his parole, his election would be regarded as 'a defiance to England and an incentive to disaffection'.OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. \\"Mr. John Mitchell.\\" Times [London, England] 6 Feb. 1875 Mitchel's candidacy raised mixed feelings on the Nationalist side.

Charles Kickham, the prominent Fenian writer, told the voters that it was unlikely the British government would render Mitchel's election void, but rather would seek support for a candidate of their own, hoping to get the Roman Catholic clergy to advise against electing Mitchel.OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. \\"The Election For Tipperary.\\" Times [London, England] 12 Feb. 1875 On 16 February 1875, no other nominations having been received, John Mitchel was declared elected, unopposed, as Member of Parliament for Tipperary.\\"News in Brief.\\" Times [London, England] 17 Feb. 1875 The next day, the House of Commons directed that a new writ be issued, as Mitchel was disqualified as an undischarged felon.\\"House Of Commons, Thursday, Feb. 18.\\" Times [London, England] 19 Feb. 1875 References 1875 elections in the United Kingdom 1875 in Ireland February 1875 events By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in County Tipperary constituencies Unopposed by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Irish constituencies 1870s elections in Ireland ","title":"February 1875 Tipperary by-election"},{"id":"41233833","text":"The High Commission of Eswatini in London is the diplomatic mission of Eswatini in the United Kingdom.

Biography  John was born in 1656, the only son and heir of Mark Mortimer, grocer of London, by his wife Abigail Walmesley of Blackmore in Essex, who married 3rd October 1651 in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes, London. His father was born into a yeoman family of Bow, Devon, and had a brother Peter who also entered into a commercial profession. John Mortimer received a commercial education, and became a prosperous merchant on Tower Hill. Land with a farmhouse in the back in Hatfield Peverel. In November 1693, at the age of about 43, he bought the estate of Topping Hall, Hatfield Peverel, Essex, which he improved; a number of cedar trees planted by him were still in there in the 19th century. Mortimer became Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1705. Mortimer was married three times. His first wife, Dorothy, born at Hursley, near Winchester, on 1 August 1660, was the ninth child of Richard Cromwell, and it is supposed that the ex-protector's return to England in 1680 was prompted by a desire to be present at the wedding. She died in childbirth (14 May 1681) within a year of the marriage. He married, secondly, Sarah, daughter of Sir John Tippets, knight, surveyor of the navy, by whom he had a son and a daughter. Thirdly, Mortimer married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Sanders of Derbyshire, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. The second son was Cromwell Mortimer.  Works Mortimer wrote Some Considerations concerning the present State of Religion, with some Essays towards our Love and Union, London, 1702, against sectarian feeling, Advice to Parents, or Rules for the Education of Children, London, 1704, and The whole Art of Husbandry, in 1707.  The whole Art of Husbandry, 1707  Title page of The whole Art of Husbandry, 1707 Mortimer's The whole Art of Husbandry, in the way of Managing and Improving of Land forms a landmark in English agricultural literature, and largely influenced husbandry in the 18th century. The writer states that he had read the best books on ancient and modern agriculture, and inspected the practice of the most diligent husbandmen in most countries. After duly digesting these he had added his own experiences. The book, which treats not only of the usual branches of agriculture, but also of fish ponds, orchards, and of the culture of silkworms, and the making of cider, is said by Donaldson (1854) to \\"form a very large advancement in the progress of agriculture from the preceding authors on the subject. Trees and fruits do still occupy too much room, but the animals are more largely introduced and systematically treated.\\"John Donaldson's Agricultural Biography, (1854) p. 41; Containing an abstract of the contents of the Art of Husbandry. The work was dedicated to the Royal Society, of which Mortimer had been admitted a member in December 1705.Thomson, Royal Society, App. p. xxxi A second edition was issued in 1708, and a third in 1712, \\"containing such additions as are proper for the husband- man and gardiner (sic) ... to which is added a Kalendar, shewing what is to be done every month in the flower garden.\\" It was translated into Swedish by Jacob Serenius in 1727, and a sixth edition, with additions, and revised by Thomas Mortimer, the writer's grandson, appeared in 2 volumes in 1761.  The whole art of husbandry, content  The whole art of husbandry consisted of a total of 15 books, published in one volume, each book divided into chapters on connected subjects. The first book has four chapters – on inclosing lands; of pastures, and meadow lands, how to improve them, and defend by banks from floods and tides; and of making hay; and of several sorts of grass seeds, as clover, sainfoin, and lucerne, – ray grass, trefoil, and several other grasses. The second book has 6 chapters – of arable land and tillage; on ploughs, of which some are figured; and the square earth board is shown and recommended for stiff clays; the Hertfordshire wheel-plough was until in the 19th century much recommended; of ploughing and laying land in ridges; of sowing corn and steeping it. The third book has three chapters, describing the different natures of soils; the ability and power of production. Book 2 of The whole Art of Husbandry, p. 41. The fourth book has seventeen chapters: I. On the manuring and digging of lands, with observations on each sort of manure ; II. Of the burning of land ; III. Of chalk ; IV. Of lime. ; V. Of marl ; VI. Of fuller's earth. ; VII. Of clay. ; VIII. Of sand. ; IX. Of earth. ; X. Of sea sand and weed. ; XI. Of dungs. ; XII. Of sheep's dung. ; XIII. Of hog's dung. ; XIV. Of urine. ; XV. Of human ordure. ; XVI. Of the dung of fowls. ; And XVII. Of several other sorts of manures, as ashes, soap ashes, soot, rags, malt dust, and the several soils each sort of manure is best for. The fifth book has 25 chapters, on grains and pulse crops, the roots, and herbaceous plants. The sixth book, of 21 chapters, treats on the animals, fowls, and insects that stock the farm. The seventh book, of three chapters, describes the pests of the farm, in four-footed and feathered beasts. The eighth book has five chapters on the uses of corn, and the making of malt. The four chapters of the ninth book treat on the small tools of work. The tenth book has four chapters on buildings and repairs. Book eleven treats on the different trees in 21 chapters. The twelfth book, in 12 chapters, describes coppice woods. The thirteenth book has two chapters on the plants of the kitchen garden. The fourteenth book has 21 chapters on fruit trees. The fifteenth book has five chapters on English liquors, as ale, cyder, and fruit wines. About agricultural lime, Mortimer prescribed, that it had to be used at the rate of 160 bushels to an acre, and laid in cinders in a bushel to a pole square, covered with earth, and spread when dissolved—but better in being carried hot on the land. It makes corn grow with a thin bark, and does not last above five years. Forty bushels or soot were sown by hand on an acre, and produced a mighty sweet grass. The spade is figured for paring land to be burned, and is the same used in the 19th century. Turnips are sown in broad cast on finely fallowed lands, in midsummer, and afford food for sheep, cows, and fattening cattle into the month of March. The crop is a great help to dry barren lands, and will grow on almost any ground—the fly and caterpillar often destroy them. The crop is thinned by twice hoeing, at an expense of 4s. to 9s. an acre, or in daily wages in that time of fourteen-pence. Stubble turnips were sown at this time of the cultivation of the plant. On farm animal Mortimer spoke of: * A bull, which should have a sharp quick countenance, forehead broad and curled, eyes black and large, horns long, neck fleshy, belly long and large, hair smooth like velvet, breast big, back straight and flat, buttocks square, thighs round, legs straight, joints short. * The cow ought to have a broad forehead, black eyes, clean great horns, neck long and thin, large deep belly, thick thighs, round legs, short joints; white, large, deep udder, having four teats, and the feet large. * Of sheep, he says, the ram must have a large, long body, forehead broad, round, and well rising, eyes cheerful and large, nostrils short and straight. The ewe must have the neck large and upright, bending like a horse's, back broad, buttocks round, tail thick, legs small and short, clean, and nimble, wool thick and deep, covering all the body; gums must be red, teeth white and even, brisket skinned, eye- strings ruddy, felt loose, wool fast, breath sweet, the feet not hot. Fat pastures are said to produce straight tall sheep, and hills and short pastures breed square ones; woods and mountains yield small and slender sheep. The observations are very judicious on the breeding and management of sheep, and differ little from the modern practice. It appears that many sheep were then rotted. In 1854 Donaldson concluded that the accompanied \\"Farmer's Calendar,\\" in directions of monthly work, would do credit to any modern publication. Mortimer also gave an account on rent, stating according to Donaldson, that but \\"few farms will afford the generally allowed increase of three rents; one for the landlord, one for charges, and the third for the tenant. A farm of 100 acres, let at £1 per acre, may be maintained for the charge of £100 yearly; but if let for £50 a year the charges will be more than double the rent; or there must be the quantity of 200 acres of land in the farm.\\"  Legacy  The British The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry by members of the Royal Society, first published from 1756 to 1768, considered John Mortimer among the foremost agriculturists of that time. The 3rd edition of The Complete Farmer (1777) even listed Mortimer in the subtitle of this work among other foremost authorities, such as Carl Linnaeus, Louis François Henri de Menon, Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, Jethro Tull, William Ellis, Philip Miller, Thomas Hale, Edward Lisle, Roque, John Mills, and Arthur Young.The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry. 3rd ed. 1777. By the end of the 18th century Mortimer authority faded. The 3rd edition (1777) of The Complete Farmer still mentioned Mortimer as reference over 50 times, but in 4th edition (1793) just over a dozen times. In his 1825 An encyclopædia of agriculture, John Claudius Loudon confirmed Mortimer's authority in the 18th century, stating: :\\"In England, from the restoration to the middle of the eighteenth century, very little improvement took place, either in the cultivation of the soil, or in the management of live stock. Even clover and turnips (the great support of the present improved system of agriculture) were confined to a few districts, and at the close of this period were scarcely cultivated at all by common farmers in the northern parts of the island. From the Whole Art of Husbandry, published by Mortimer in 1706, a work of considerable merit, it does not appear that any improvement was made on his practices till near the end of last century. In those districts where clover and rye-grass were cultivated, they were cut green, and used for soiling as at present. Turnips were sown broadcast, hand hoed, and used for feeding sheep and cattle, as they were used in Houghton's time, and are still in most districts of England.John Claudius Loudon\\"(1825) An encyclopædia of agriculture, Donaldson in his 1854 Agricultural Biography, credited both Mortimer and John Mills for being the first authors, who wrote on agriculture, presenting all the branches of the art within the compass of one work.John Donaldson. \\"John Mills, F.R.S.\\". in: Agricultural Biography, 1854, p. 51 John Mills succeeded, according to Donaldson, while \\"Worlidge began the attempt, but failed in the comprehension required.\\"Samuel Austin Allibone.

It is one of the longest streets in Portland, running down the entire east side of the city, and extending into suburbs to the south. The street runs from Airport Way Frontage Rd in Northeast Portland, south through Clackamas and Happy Valley, to Interstate 205 in Gladstone. Oregon 213 continues south beyond I-205. Within the city of Portland, it runs through the neighborhoods of Montavilla and Madison South, and it serves as a boundary line for the neighborhoods of Roseway, Cully, Sumner, South Tabor, Foster-Powell, Mt. Scott-Arleta, Brentwood-Darlington, and Lents. It is a highly commercial street that, in many of these neighborhoods, is directly surrounded by dense neighborhoods of primarily single-family homes. The MAX Light Rail serves 82nd Avenue directly at the Interstate 84 overpass, where the NE 82nd Ave MAX Station offers access to MAX's Blue, Green, and Red lines. The Green Line then parallels 82nd Avenue going south along I-205 to Clackamas Town Center Transit Center. The Red Line roughly parallels the northern portion of 82nd Avenue. The entire length of 82nd Avenue is signed as Oregon Route 213. Because it is a state highway, 82nd Avenue is under the jurisdiction of the Oregon Department of Transportation. The agency views the street's top priorities as moving high volumes of automobile traffic efficiently, serving freight traffic, and serving as an alternative route when I-205 has problems. There is interest in transferring jurisdiction from the state to the City of Portland, in a transfer similar to what has already happened with North Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Sandy Boulevard. In an attempt to improve the quality of life around 82nd Avenue, the 82nd Avenue Improvement Coalition was formed; among its main goals is the transfer of ownership of 82nd Avenue to City of Portland control, instead of state control. As of 2014, five of the intersections along 82nd ranked among the most dangerous 5% of Oregon intersections, with six of its intersections identified as high-crash by the City of Portland. The Oregon Department of Transportation planned to spend $5 million on safety improvements. Nearby residents often cross this five-lane road for school, work, or recreation—there are a variety of schools, parks, and community centers that are sited along 82nd Avenue, such as Vestal Elementary, Portland Community College, and Montavilla Community Center. The intersection of 82nd and Glisan Street is among the city's identified high-crash intersections, and it is ranked by the City of Portland as the most dangerous intersection within Portland for pedestrians, however no public plans have been announced to improve this intersection.

She won six of her twenty-two races and was rated the best British filly of her generation at both two and three years of age. In 1980 she won three of her six races including the Cherry Hinton Stakes, Lowther Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she recorded her biggest wins in France where she won the Prix de Diane and the Prix Vermeille, but produced arguably her best performance in defeat when finishing second in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In 1981 she was sent to race in the United States where she won the Queen Charlotte Handicap, but failed to reproduce her European form. She was then retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare. Background Mrs Penny was a \\"lengthy\\" chestnut mare with a broad white blaze and a long white sock on her right hind leg bred by Marshall Jenney at the Derry Meeting Farm near Cochranville, Pennsylvania . She was sired by Great Nephew, a British stallion whose other progeny included Grundy and Shergar. Her dam Tananarive won in France when owned by her breeder Daniel Wildenstein and was exported to the United States when pregnant with the filly who would become Mrs Penny. Tananarive later produced Cadeaux d'Amie, the dam of the 1000 Guineas winner Hatoof. As a yearling, Mr Penny was sent to the Saratoga sales and bought for $40,000 by the American lawyer Eric Kronfeld. She was sent to race in Europe where she was trained by Ian Balding at Kingsclere. Like many Balding-trained horses she usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season Mrs Penny finished second in her first two races over the minimum distance of five furlongs before being moved up in class and distance for the Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July. Ridden by John Matthias, she started at odds of 11/1, with the Queen Mary Stakes winner Abeer being made favourite. Mrs Penny started slowly and appeared to have little chance until the final furlong, but finished very strongly to overtake Abeer in the closing stages and win by three quarters of a length. Abeer had been conceding nine pounds to Mrs Penny at Newmarket, and when the fillies met again at a three-pound difference in the Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse in August she was widely expected to reverse the placings. Starting the 11/2 third choice in the betting, Mrs Penny took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won decisively by two lengths from Teacher's Pet, with Abeer in fourth place. In September, Mrs Penny was matched against colts and started favourite for the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury Racecourse. She led for most of the way but faded in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Lord Seymour, Taufan and Known Fact. Mrs Penny's final race of the season was the Cheveley Park Stakes, which was then the only British Group One race restricted to two-year-old fillies. She started at odds of 7/1, with La Legende being made favourite ahead of Luck of the Draw and the Irish-trained Monroe. Mr Penny took the lead two furlongs from the finish, and rallied after being headed by Millingdale Lillie to regain the advantage and win by a short head. At the end of the year the independent Timeform organization described her as an \\"admirably game\\" filly who would have no difficulties competing over longer distances. 1980: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut, Mrs Penny ran in the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the 1000 Guineas, over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April and finished second, half a length behind Millingdale Lillie with Quick As Lightning in third place. Two weeks later, on 1 May, Mrs Penny, started the 8/1 third favourite for the 168th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. She took the lead with two furlongs left to run, but at least seven fillies were still in contention a furlong out, and in a driving finish Mr Penny finished third, beaten a neck and half a length by Quick As Lightning and Our Home. On 24 May, Mrs Penny started third favourite for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh and finished third of the eighteen runners behind Cairn Rouge and Millingdale Lillie. Lester Piggott took over from John Matthias as Mrs Penny's jockey when the filly was sent to France and moved up in distance to contest the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. She started at odds of 8.2/1 against twelve opponents which included the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Aryenne and the Prix Saint-Alary winner Paranete. She took the lead in the straight and held off the sustained challenge of Aryenne to win by a short neck, becoming the first British-trained winner of the race since Highclere in 1974. Mrs Penny was then aimed at Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in July. Piggott settled the filly just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third place before moving up to challenge the four-year-old colt Ela-Mana-Mou inside the final quarter mile. She briefly looked likely to win, but was outstayed by the older horse and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length, five lengths clear of the other runners. In the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York on 19 August, Mrs Penny was unable to obtain a clear run in the straight before finishing strongly to take fourth place behind Master Willie, Cairn Rouge and Cracaval. As Piggott was serving a suspension, Matthias reclaimed the ride on Mrs Penny when the filly was sent to France in September for the Prix Vermeille over 2400m on soft ground at Longchamp Racecourse. The race attracted an exceptionally strong field including Detroit, Aryenne, Cairn Rouge, Gold River and Paranete. Starting at odds of 8.8/1 she took the lead in the straight and held off several challengers to win by half a length from the Irish-trained outsider Little Bonny with Detroit in third and Gold River fourth. On her final appearance of the season, Mrs Penny started at odds of 12/1 for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 5 October when she was again ridden by Matthias. Racing on firmer ground she held a good position on the turn into the straight but dropped back in the closing stages and finished fifteenth of the twenty runners behind Detroit. At the end of the year, Timform described her as \\"a very game, tough, consistent filly\\". 1981: four-year-old season Mrs Penny remained in training as a four-year-old in England, but failed to recover her best form, finishing fourth behind Master Willie in the Coronation Cup and unplaced behind Pelerin in the Hardwicke Stakes. She was then sent to race in the United States where he was trained by Thomas Skiffington. She ran six times, with her best efforts being a second place behind Match The Hatch in the Manhattan Handicap at Belmont Park in September and a win in the Grade III Queen Charlotte Handicap at Meadowlands Racetrack in October. Assessment In 1979, Mrs Penny was given a rating of 119 by Timeform, making her the second-best two-year-old filly of the year behind the French-trained Aryenne. In the official International Classification she was rated a pound ahead of Aryenne and level with Princess Lida as the best two- year-old filly in Europe. In 1980, Mrs Penny was given a rating of 127 by Timeform organisation, equal with Bireme and Shoot A Line and four pounds below the top-rated three-year-old filly Detroit. In the International Classification she was rated two pounds below Detroit and level with Shoot A Line. Stud record Mrs Penny was retired from racing to become a broodmare in the United States for Kronfeld's Maverick Productions and died in 1997. She produced at least nine foals and six winner between 1984 and 1996: *Tale of Intrigue (bay filly, foaled in 1984, sired by Alleged), failed to win in six races *Pennsylvania (chestnut filly, 1985, by Northjet), failed to win in two races *Mrs Jenney (chestnut filly, 1986, by The Minstrel), won two races in England and two races in the United States, dam of the Whitney Stakes winner Unaccounted For *Northern Park (bay colt, 1988, by Northern Dancer), won one race *Pennys Valentine (chestnut filly, 1989, by Storm Cat), won one race in France and one in the United States, dam of the Prix Quincey winner Penny's Gold *Pencombe (bay colt, 1990, by Nureyev), won one race in France and one race in Dubai *Fort Knox (chestnut colt, 1993, by Miswaki), won two races in the United States *Woods Landing (colt, 1995, by Woodman), won four races in the United States *Hand Crafted (colt, 1996, by Woodman), failed to win in two races Breeding References 1977 racehorse births 1997 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in Pennsylvania Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Thoroughbred family 25 ","title":"Mrs Penny"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("section",null,[t("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[t("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),t("section",null,[t("div",I,[(a(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(a(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const B=d(x,[["render",R]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/25.md","filePath":"library/25.md"}'),H={name:"library/25.md"},E=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{D as __pageData,E as default};
