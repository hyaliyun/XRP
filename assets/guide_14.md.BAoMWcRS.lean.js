Early life  Villiers was born Marie José de la Barre d’Erquelinnes on April 30 1916 at Cuckfield, Sussex. After the end of World War I, the family returned to Jurbise. Villiers was educated at home before attending the Convent of the Assumption at Mons. She also attended a finishing school in Haywards Heath, Sussex. She was one of seven children, five boys and two girls.  World War II  In 1938 Villiers and sister joined the newly formed Motor Corps of the Red Cross. She was trained as an ambulance driver and mechanic and, after the German forces invaded Belgium, she accompanied the Corps on missions throughout the country. While helping to evacuate patients from hospitals, her vehicle was strafed by enemy fighters and two of her charges died. After the occupation of Belgium in May 1940, Italian air force officers occupied her Villiers’s family chateau Villiers joined the newly formed Resistance and gathered information on German aircraft at the nearby Chièvres airfield. Villiers became part of “Service Zero”, initially headed by Charles Woeste. She was trained to recognise all the different aircraft by their silhouettes and draw target maps by the Resistance. Her work was of great value to British intelligence, which needed to know the proportion of bombers to fighter planes at any given time. She extended her intelligence activity to cover several German airfields in Belgium and northern France, and recruited agents to help her. By October 1942 Service Zero had been betrayed and many of its members, including Woeste, were arrested. With her family already in Britain, Villiers went underground, sneaking through France and Spain before flying to London from Portugal. In Britain, Villiers worked for Belgian Emergency Relief. In autumn 1944, she went to the American Delta Base in Marseille as a liaison officer.  After World War II  Villiers met her husband, Charles Villiers, after a British friend asked her to look after him because he had fallen ill while staying at a hotel in Brussels. The couple married in 1946. They then took a four-month honeymoon, travelling through Africa in an old Chevrolet delivery van to research investment opportunities. The couple had two daughters together, in addition to Charles's son from a previous marriage. After her marriage, Villiers became friends with the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Villiers trained as a school care worker and spent 20 years working in the East End of London. In 1988, she published Granny was a Spy, an account of her wartime exploits.  Death  Villiers died on 1 February 2015, aged 98.  Awards  For her wartime work, the Belgian government awarded her the Chevalier de l’Ordre de la Couronne with Palme, Croix de Guerre with Palme, Médaille de la Resistance, Médaille Commemorative de la Guerre 1940-45 and the Croix des Evades. The French government awarded her a Croix de Guerre. From the American government, she received the Bronze Star.

Zhong served on Xi's staff beginning in Zhejiang province, then followed him to Shanghai, and then Beijing. Zhong currently serves as director of Xi Jinping Office and director of the General Office of the Central Military Commission. He holds the military rank of Lieutenant general in 2019. Career Zhong was born in Kaihua County, Zhejiang, near the modern city of Quzhou. He hold a master's degree from Zhejiang University. He once served as the deputy head of the provincial party's Organization Department in Zhejiang. It is not clear when Zhong began working for Xi, but evidence suggests that Zhong was on Xi's staff at least as early as when Xi was serving as the Communist Party Secretary of Zhejiang province. In Zhejiang, Zhong often drafted Xi's official statements. Upon the sacking of Chen Liangyu due to a corruption scandal, the central authorities selected Xi to fill the position vacated by Chen as party chief of Shanghai. The transfer elevated Xi from a relatively unknown provincial administrator to the front runner to succeed Hu Jintao as the next leader of the Communist Party. Zhong then followed Xi to Shanghai and took on the title of deputy chief of the municipal party General Office, and often accompanied Xi on visits. When Xi was transferring his duties to his successor as Zhejiang party chief Zhao Hongzhu, Zhong would frequently accompany Xi on trips between Shanghai and Hangzhou. It was said that on some trips, Zhong was the only person accompanying Xi. In the fall of 2007, Xi was transferred to Beijing to become a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China. Zhong was promptly also transferred to Beijing to work for the General Office of the Communist Party of China. Upon arriving in Beijing, Zhong also enrolled in a doctorate program at the prestigious Tsinghua University, some say he was admitted with the help of then Tsinghua party chief and friend Chen Xi. On June 11, 2013, Zhong was seen in military uniform (with the rank insignia of a senior colonel) on national television watching the launch of the Shenzhou 10 spacecraft at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre accompanying Xi Jinping. Zhong's relationship with Xi has been compared to that between former General Secretary Jiang Zemin and his former secretary Jia Ting'an (later promoted to General in the People's Liberation Army) and that between former General Secretary Hu Jintao and his chief aide Ling Jihua. However, there is not much publicly available information about Zhong or about his relationship with Xi Jinping. He has additionally been named as a member of the \\"New Zhijiang Army\\", that is, a trusted lieutenant of Xi Jinping who shares Xi's political philosophies and who may become an important political player or be destined for higher office in the near future.

Bahuma, described as an \\"exceptional soldier\\" by Le Potentiel and one of the Congo's \\"most popular and reform-minded officers\\" by The Economist, commanded the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) in the provinces of North and South Kivu during the M23 rebellion and Allied Democratic Forces insurgency. Bahuma was born in the village of Tolaw in Isangi Territory, near Kisangani, in 1957. He began his military career under the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, attending military academies in the Congo and France. During the Second Congo War, he commanded the military wing of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) and was later re-integrated into the Congolese army. Bahuma was appointed to the command of the 8th Military Region, covering Kivu, by President Joseph Kabila following the fall of Goma to M23 rebels in 2012. The fall of Goma in November 2012 was widely perceived as an embarrassment for the FARDC and the United Nations' MONUSCO peacekeeping force and led to calls for reform. Morale among government forces in the region was low. After taking command, Bahuma reformed the FARDC in the region, cutting down on corruption. He was personally credited for much of the FARDC's subsequent success against M23 in the Kivu region by international observers. He gained a reputation as a reformist, alongside Lieutenant General François Olenga and Colonel , and attempted to turn the FARDC into a professional military force. During a diplomatic mission to Uganda in August 2014, Bahuma suffered a heart attack. Taken to a hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, he died on 30 August aged 57. His death was viewed by some as suspicious, following the assassination of Ndala, head of the Unité de réponse rapide (URR), in Kivu eight months previously. It was rumoured that he had been poisoned. Foreign commentators rejected this theory, but noted that Bahuma's death would slow attempts to reform the FARDC. Bahuma received posthumous tributes from a number of leading Congolese politicians and was posthumously awarded the \\"Héros nationaux Kabila-Lumumba\\" medal by President Kabila. A 48-hour period of mourning was observed by students at the Christian Bilingual University of Congo in Beni, North Kivu in his honour. In September, Brigadier General Emmanuel Lombe Bangwangu was announced as Bahuma's replacement as head of the 8th Military Region.

It was flown with some success in competitions in 1920 and 1921. Design and development Caudron C.39 photo from L'Aerophile-Salon, 1921 Between 1919 and 1922, Caudron built a series of multi-engined civil passenger transport biplanes of similar design but increasing size and engine power, the C.33, C.37, C.39, C.43 and C.61. The C.39 and C.43 shared the same airframe but had three and five engines respectively. The C.39 was a three-bay biplane with fabric-covered, rectangular-plan wings mounted without stagger. The lower wing had dihedral outboard of the engines; it had a smaller span than the upper one which carried the ailerons, aerodynamically balanced by overhanging extensions beyond the tips. The wings were joined by vertical pairs of interplane struts, the forward members attached near the leading edges, and the centre section was supported by similar, shorter cabane struts from the upper fuselage. The inner bay was defined by two close pairs of leaning interplane struts, with a Clerget 9B nine cylinder rotary engines about halfway between the wings. Each wing-mounted engine was in a long, cylindrical cowling, open at the rear. The third engine, another cowled Clerget 9, was in the nose; behind it the fuselage had a square section. The pilot and engineer had an open cockpit with its windscreen immediately under the wing leading edge. The passenger cabin, long, wide and high, was lit by six small windows on each side and was accessed through a starboard-side door. Behind the wings the fuselage tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical-edged unbalanced rudder that reached down to the keel. The fabric-covered tailplane had a straight leading edge with angled tips, and was mounted on top of the fuselage so its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. In landplane configuration the C.39 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of main wheels mounted on single axles attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine at each end on short, forward-raked V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat-bottomed floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted W-struts, one to each side of the float, assisted by an inverted V-strut from the inside edge to the wing root. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off. In either configuration the undercarriage track was . Operational history The date of the first flight, made in landplane configuration, is not known. By the spring of 1920 it was flying with floats, for it competed with the C.33, C.43 and another French aircraft as well as three from Italy in the Grand Prix de Monaco, a seaplane event held between 18 April and 2 May. During the contest Maïcon flew it from Monaco to Ajaccio and back in 8 hrs 10 min, but like the other civil aircraft taking part the C.39 was eliminated. The C.39 returned to the same competition in April the following year and was much more successful. Flown again by Maïcon, it won first prize over the Monaco-Ajacco-Monaco circuit in almost the same time as in 1920. it also won over the shorter Monaco-Cannes-San Remo and return course, during which it reached an altitude of in 45 minutes carrying of ballast. Their attempt in the speed trial was cut short by a fire. With smoke in the cockpit Maïcon lost control and sideslipped into the sea near Saint- Raphaël. No one was hurt and the C.39 was recovered, though seriously damaged. By June 1921 it was a landplane again and competing in the Grand Prix d'Aéro- Club de France. Pilot Maïcon and flight engineer Courcy were forced to land near Bordeaux with an engine problem. After it was repaired, long grass prevented their take-off and they retired, though only after what L'Aérophile described as a \\"magnificent debut\\".

Murg near Raumünzach Forbach Granite (), also called Raumünzach-Granite (Raumünzach-Granit), is a type of granite rock that occurs in the Northern Black Forest. It is part of the Northern Black Forest's granitic massif, to which Bühlertal granite and Wildbad granite also belong. Forbach granite predominantly outcrops in the counties of Calw and Rastatt. The most important quarrying area for Forbach granite used to be the middle Murg valley near Forbach. Today it is only quarried near Raumünzach. Forbach Granite is about 305 million years old. The stone is coarse-grained - this points to a slowly cooling of the lava / magma (at the time the formation of the stone). Forbach Granite is a bright mica, coloured from gray to pink. Forbach Granite includes the following minerals. * Alkali feldspars (up to 44 percent) have a size of up to 5 centimetre and leads to a red colour. * Quartz (26 percent). * Plagioclase (20 percent) * Muscovite (5 percent) * Biotite (5 percent) and leads to the distinct structured texture. * Apatite (below 1 percent) * Monazite(rare) * Xenotime (rare)  Literature  * W.

Her publications included a landmark survey of the international business relations of Czechoslovakia, An Economic Background to Munich, published in 1974. She co-authored her most recent work, Nation, State and the Economy in History (2003), with the Austrian economist historian, Herbert Matis. Teichova was born into a Jewish family in Vienna on 19 September 1920 to Arthur Schwarz, a watchmaker, and Gisela (née Leist). She was raised in a single room residence in the Floridsdorf district of Vienna, where her father owned a watch shop. The family fled Austria in the late 1930s following the rise of the Nazis and the Anschluss in 1938. Alice, who had obtained a job as a maid in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, England, was the first to flee the country. The rest of the family later joined her in the United Kingdom.

This genus of bacteria lacks a cell wall around their cell membrane. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Mycoplasma are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered, can survive without oxygen and are typically about 0. 1 μm in diameter. Mycoplasma salivarium is found in the mouths of 97% of the healthy population, and is generally considered to be a commensal organism and part of the normal oral flora. Mycoplasma salivarium has, however, been implicated in eye and ear disorders, oral infection, septic arthritis and periodontal disease. This species has been isolated from synovial fluid from patients with chronic arthritis and from primates. It has been recovered from a biliary stent. It also was recovered from the pleural cavity of a hospitalized man who did not respond to the normal treatment of conventional antibiotics. And it has been cultured from brain abscesses. It has also been recently identified as a common finding in patients with ventilator-acquired pneumonia, a severe infection which can occur in patients in the intensive care unit, and it may play a role in dampening down the immune response to other pathogens so allowing opportunistic infection to develop. The type strain is ATCC 23064 = IFO (now NBRC) 14478 = NCTC 10113.

His command encompassed the M23 rebellion and Mwakibolwa was personally credited with making an important contribution to the defeat of the M23 rebels in Kivu Province. Mwakibolwa served in the TPDF for over 30 years. Before receiving the command of the FIB, he served as commander of the Military Assessment Team of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) in October 2012 to assess the military situation in the Eastern Congo. The FIB, of which Mwakibolwa was the first commander as brigadier general, is a military formation which forms part of the MONUSCO mission. During Mwakibolwa tenure, MONUSCO was under the command of Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz. The FIB was authorized by the United Nations Security Council on 28 March 2013 through United Nations Security Council Resolution 2098 and was the first UN peacekeeping formation specifically tasked to carry out offensive operations to neutralize armed groups that threaten State authority and civilian security. After the end of his mandate in April 2014, Mwakibolwa returned to Tanzania with his contingent of Tanzanian soldiers.

Founded in 2006, the company has members from various fields such as visuals arts, media arts, computer programming, architecture, engineering and more. They have collaborated with various professionals and companies to produce music, dance recitals, videos and even sports such as a figure skate, facing, basketball and synchronised swimming. They came to wide attention in 2008 with Daito Manabe's YouTube video and 2010 with Perfume's live concert at Tokyo Dome and have become a common sight at Ars Electronica and transmedia festivals around the world. Origin Rhizomatiks was founded as a collective of creative people in 2006 in Tokyo to work on large-scale commercial projects.< One early project was with the Japanese pop group Perfume, work with the single Polyrhythm in 2007, which led to touring with the band. They became widely noticed with a video piece in 2008 called Electric Stimulus To Face, which had more than a million YouTube hits in its first month. The company has gone international, becoming a fixture at transmedia festivals around the world and has expanded its portfolio 10x. In 2014, the collaborated with dance troupe Elevenplay, appearing at the Festival Internacional Cervantino. They also participated in the Art Fair Tokyo 2015, by displaying their \\"mega-synth system,\\" which works like a regular synthesizer. Members Rhizomatiks is an eclectic combination of creators which includes architects, visual artists, media artists, designers, musicians, engineers and programmers. The founder of the group is (1976), an artist, composer, programmer, designer, DJ and VJ. Manabe is from a traditional media art environment, with a degree in dynamic sensory programming from the International Academy of Media Arts and Sciences and a degree in mathematics from the Tokyo University of Science. The CTO of the group is Motoi Ishibashi (1976), an artist and engineer. Lives and works in Tokyo. Ishibashi studied control systems engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, followed by mechanical and image processing engineering at the Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences (IAMAS) in Gifu, at the inception of digital media production. He met Manabe at IAMAS, who was also a student there. He is currently working on the development of new artistic methods touching on both the visual environment and the elaboration of engineering solutions in terms of artistic production and interactive public spaces. In 2011, he and Manabe were the recipients of an Award of Distinction in the interactive art category of the Prix Ars Electronica. That same year, he received the Excellence Award at the 15th edition of the Japan Media Art Festival. Since 2015, he has co- directed Rhizomatiks Research along with Manabe, a strand devoted to research and development in the spheres of art, technology and entertainment. Founding member Seiichi Saito (1975) studied architectural design At Columbia University in New York and worked in advertising starting in 2000 before returning to Japan and joining Rhizomatiks. His is noted for this three- dimensional interactive commercial art work, based on architectural concepts. Today he is the director of the company and also lectures part-time at the Tokyo University of Science. Other founding member is Hidenori Chiba, who has a background in website development. Currently his is in charge of web design, system engineering and programming. Other members of the company include Satoshi Horii, Daisuke Nakahama, Hiroyasu Kimora, Sumito Kamoi, Ichiro Kojima, Youichi Sakamoto, Muryo Honma, Motoi Ishibashi and Keisuki Arikuni and more people. Work and artistry Rhizomatiks produces interactive materials with their work crossing the boundaries between design, art and entertainment. Projects often involved collecting massive amounts of data using motion capture, kinect controllers and sensors to track dance movements in order to recreate human forms and movements as 3-D representations in real time. They also use projection mapping, lasers, sonar, robots and even drones. New ideas will cross between artistic and commercial projects. The commercial pieces tend to be on a larger scale because of funding. (Rhizomatiks) is like a music label, Manabe says. People with similar values gather and each person pursues different projects. Leadership changes from project to project. They’re a challenging group of people, Shimizu says. Whether the project's commercial or noncommercial in nature, they aren’t able to stop trying something new. They are not just artists, they’re also Japanese craftsmen who focus on detail. This might also explain why they are essentially ‘process driven’ (in the way they approach projects).

He served as secretary of both the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the Orthodox Union (OU), then called the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations of America. Lucas was born and educated in London, England The middle path While a staunch traditionalist, Lucas saw that second- and third-generation American Jews could not sustain the milieu of European Orthodoxy. The pull of American culture was too strong, and the communal walls too weak. He therefore encouraged integration of Orthodox Jewry into America, while parrying assimilation. While Lucas fought the assimilationist Reform movement, he supported all Jews - whether Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform - in their struggles with discrimination. However, he would not participate in activities involving the Reform establishment, even when the goals were in line with his own. For example, he refused to join the New York Kehillah, initially formed to fight anti-Semitism in the NYPD and promote common cause in the kosher meat industry, because it was a joint effort of Orthodox and Reform congregations. In contrast, Lucas helped form and direct the JDC. This communal effort against Jewish poverty throughout the world, and especially in Eastern Europe, was supported and run by Jews from all denominations. However, unlike the Kehillah, the Reform movement was not directly involved; many members and officers were Reform, but as individuals, not primarily representing Reform religious institutions. Lucas was one of eight directors, and served as secretary of the board. Practically, though, the JDC was funded by contributions from appeals in all types of synagogue. The result was that Lucas walked a fine line down the middle between European traditionalists and Reform modernists. Paradoxically, this meant that he was often in conflict with both. Causes * Repeal of Blue Laws restricting business on Sundays, a problem for Orthodox businessmen who closed on Saturday * Protecting Sabbath- keeping workers from discrimination and reprisals, an infamous problem in the New York garment industry and civil service * Keeping religion out of public schools * Fighting anti-Semitism on behalf of all Jews * Education for girls * Anti-missionary work * Jewish youth and education Education and recreation initiatives As part of his education and anti-assimilation initiatives, Lucas cajoled local synagogues into allowing him to create religious classes on their premises. For example, Lucas served as principal of the Sons of Israel Congregational Sunday School. These \\"schools\\" and \\"associations\\" borrowed from both the traditional Talmud Torah model and modern education methods. Lucas also set up Jewish Centres, which combined recreation with Jewish secular and religious activities. These \\"settlements\\" combined elements of traditional heder, modern Talmud Torah, and Jewish Community Center. While his Centres did not last, they had a profound impact on evolving Jewish education in America, and helped stem the tide of assimilation.

On his lands in Sutherland he was one of the first landlords to evict tenants in order to create sheep farms, a process which grew to become the Highland Clearances. He used his political power in Orkney to return as Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland first his brother Robert, then his son Robert, and finally a younger son Richard.  Early life  His father Patrick Honyman of Graemsay was a descendant of Andrew Honyman, a 17th-century Bishop of Orkney. The family claimed maternal descent from Sir Robert Stewart, an illegitimate son of King James V of Scotland. His mother Margaret MacKay, was the elder daughter of Captain. John MacKay, 5th Laird of Strathy (died 1783) and descendant of John MacKay, 2nd Lord Reay & 15th Chief of Clan MacKay (c1612-80)  Legal career  Honyman was called to the bar in 1777, and became Sheriff-Depute of Lanarkshire in July 1786. As Sheriff, he was involved in the investigations into the political reformer Thomas Muir of Huntershill, interrogating potential witnesses for Muir's show trial on a charge of sedition before the Lord Justice Clerk (Scotland's most senior judge) Lord Braxfield, who was also Honyman's father-in-law. Muir's admission to the Faculty of Advocates and his appointment as Sheriff were both aided by the support of Sir Lawrence Dundas, who had bought the earldom of Orkney and lordship of Zetland from James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton and become known as the \\"Dundas of Kerse\\". In the 1770s, the Honymans supported Dundas and his son Colonel Thomas Dundas, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland in the 1770s. In February 1797 he was appointed as a judge in succession to Lord Dreghorn. He joined the Lords of Justiciary in June 1799 after the promotion of Lord Eskgrove, and in 1804 was made a baronet, taking the territorial designation of Armadale, after his lands on the north coast of Sutherland. He resigned from his judicial posts in 1811 and retired to Smyllum Park, his estate in Lanarkshire.  Orkney  Despite his judicial career, Honyman actively excised his political strength in Orkney. The Kerse control of Scottish parliamentary seats was being challenged by Henry Dundas (later Lord Melville), and in the 1780s the Honymans transferred their support to Henry Dundas. In 1790, William Honyman helped secure the election in Orkney of John Balfour, who defeated Sir Lawrence's son Thomas in a contested election. By the 1796 election, Honyman hoped that his son Robert, then only 15 years old, would take the seat when he was old enough. After prolonged negotiations with Balfour, Honyman installed his half-brother Commander Robert to keep it in the family until young Robert was eligible. Despite growing challenges to Honyman's hegemony, young Robert (by now a 25-year-old Major in the 93rd Foot) was returned for Orkney in 1806. However, shortly after his election the new MP was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in the 18th Foot, and never voted or spoke in the House of Commons. By the 1807 election, Honyman supported the election of his rival Malcolm Laing. Laing's health declined, and at the 1812 election Honyman's rivals divided, allowing the election of Honyman's younger son Richard (Robert having died of fever in Jamaica in 1808). However, his rivals met in February 1818 and agreed to combine against the Honymans. Thereafter, the Orkney seat was alternated between the Balfour, Dundas and Laing families.  Sutherland  In 1790 Honyman purchased lands at Strathy on the north coast of Sutherland from his maternal grandfather Captain John Mackay. The estate included Armadale, which Honyman later took as his judicial title. Honyman was one of the first landlords in the north of Scotland to recognise the higher returns available from sheep farming, and became one of the pioneers of the Highland Clearances in which the people were driven off their land. Honyman divided his estate into three, and by 1800 he had cleared the people from the valley of Armadale to a new coastal settlement, establishing a new Armadale Sheep Farm on an area 6 miles by 4. The estate was sold in 1813 to the Marquess of Stafford (later 1st Duke of Sutherland), who continued the clearance.  West Lothian  Also in 1790, Honyman purchased lands at Barbauchlaw in West Lothian, which he renamed Armadale.  Family  In 1777 Honyman married Mary McQueen, the daughter of Lord Braxfield, by whom he had at least five sons and four daughters. The two oldest sons joined the British Army, Patrick serving in the 28th Light Dragoons, and Robert becoming a Lieutenant colonel of the 18th Regiment of Foot. In 1820, John Wade's The Black Book: Or, Corruption Unmasked collated data on pensions paid out of the civil list of England and the heritable revenue of Scotland. Wade revealed that in Sir William's pensions as a retired amounted judge of £1,800 per annum (equivalent to £,000 in ). This sum was revised by the 1831 edition of Wade's book to £1,950, when Wade noted that Lady Mary Honyman had in February 1814 been awarded a pension of £137 per year, followed in June 1815 by further pensions of £37 for each of their for daughters: Mary, Catherine, Margaret and Jemima. Wade singled out the Honymans for special criticism. He noted that the family \\"possessed a considerable estate ... how they came to be chargeable on the civil list is most extraordinary.\\" The Scottish Reformers Gazette said \\"we can only account for their appearance here, by recollecting that Sir William Honyman, in 1793, then Mr Honyman, Sheriff of Lanarkshire, was the most active in hunting for evidence against Thomas Muir of Huntershill\\".

Iran's military action against ISIL   In Syria  Since the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, Iran is supporting the Syrian government against its opponents, including ISIL.  In Iraq  Iran was the first country to pledge assistance to Iraq to fight ISIL, deploying troops in early June 2014 following the North Iraq offensive. President of Iraq Fuad Masum has praised Iran as \\"the first country to provide weapons to Iraq to fight against the ISIL Takfiri terrorists\\". Iran's Quds Force is a \\"key player\\" in the military intervention against ISIL and its \\"mastermind\\" commander Major General Qassem Soleimani maintained a frequent presence in Iraq while his pictures in the battlefield were regularly published. Iran–Iraq border In 14 March 2016, two ISIL cells equipped with explosive devices were eliminated near the border by the Ground Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran Army.  Iran's political stance  Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Javad Zarif has described ISIL as an \\"ideological sibling\\" to Al-Qaeda, adding \\"the so-called Islamic State, is neither Islamic nor a state\\". Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has openly commented on the American-led intervention in Iraq and the Combined Joint Task Force:  Designation as \\"terrorist\\"  Iranian official and semi-official media outlets such as state-run Iran Daily, IRIB-affiliated Press TV and IRGC-tied news agencies Fars and Tasnim frequently call ISIL as \\"terrorist organization\\" and \\"Takfiri\\". The deputy secretary of Supreme National Security Council has also called it \\"terrorist group\\".https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2014/12/02/576287/iranian-official- us-not-serious-about-countering-isil-terrorists  ISIL's threats to Iran  While Iran is a Shia-dominant country, ISIL is ideologically anti-Shia and regards Shias as infidels, having killed thousands of them. After rapidly expanding in Iraq, ISIL became a threat only kilometers away from Iranian western borders. With the Pakistan-based Sunni Jihadist groups in eastern Iran and an ongoing Sistan and Baluchestan insurgency, some alarmed the possibility of a wider backlash there. Iran threatened ISIL that managing to attack Baghdad or holy shrines of Shia Imams and getting close to Iran-Iraq border is \\"over the red lines\\" and if they are crossed, Iran will engage in a direct action. In September 2014, Iranian paper Islamic Republican quoted Hadana news reporting \\"ISIL designated Emir for Iran and several of his aides were arrested by security bodies\\". The report did not name the Emir, and did not say if they had been able to sneak into Iran or arrested abroad. Neither did it mention the security bodies of which country have made the arrest. In the same month, Minister of Interior Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli announced Iran has arrested several suspected members of ISIL trying to enter Iran. He said that two or three of them have confessed \\"entering Iran has been among the plans of the ISIL\\" and dismissed the reports on the ISIL move to recruit members inside Iran, despite noting \\"this does not mean that the group has not launched a publicity campaign for recruitment\\". On 29 January 2015, ISIL announced a new province called Wilayat Khorasan consisting of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \\"other nearby lands\\". Hafiz Saeed Khan was designated as Emir of the province. Pakistani Hafiz Saeed Khan, also known as Mulla Saeed Orakzai, is a former member of the Taliban. On 7 June 2017, ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack on the Iranian Parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini. The attack was confirmed to have left 16 dead and was the first instance of an ISIL attack within Iran's borders. There are worries about the implications of this attack on President Hassan Rouhani's \\"moderation project\\".  Iranian citizens and ISIL  Tehran Bureau reports a popular support on Iran's military action against ISIL. According to Al Jazeera, as of January 2015 \\"hundreds\\" of Iranian Sunni Kurds have crossed the Iran-Iraq border to fight ISIL, mostly joining Iraqi Kurdistan fighters also known as Peshmerga. Several research works and polls conducted by a security body in Iran have shown that Iran's Sunni community \\"are not interested in membership in the ISIL\\". However, Erbil-based website Rudaw cites a Facebook post from the One ISIL page saying that in October 2014, 23 Kurds from Iran had joined the group. Kurdish activist Mokhtar Hoshmand has claimed \\"20 Iranian Kurdish members of ISIL have been killed and 30 have been injured\\".

Coral species in this genus are commonly known as whip or wire corals because they often exhibit a twisted or coiled morphology. In addition to their colorful appearance, with colors ranging from yellow to red passing through blue and green, these species possess a dark skeleton that is characteristic to every black coral. Distribution Commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, these corals are part of the reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans, at depths greater than . Long and unbranched, Cirrhipathes species are attached to coral reefs. Description Like all corals, Cirrhipathes species are made of and covered by polyps. These polyps are responsible for providing defense and feeding mechanisms in the form of stinging structures known as nematocysts. These structures, which are present in their tentacles, are fired at preys or predators. The characteristic barbed-wire-like appearance of Cirrhipathes species is the result of their inability to completely retract their polyps. They can grow up to more than three meters in length.Wildscreen Arkive. Accessed via http://www.arkive.org/black-corals/cirrhipathes-spp/ on 2015-04-03 Corals in this genus have different ways of obtaining nutrients. While some species obtain nutrients from their mutualistic interaction with photosynthetic zooxanthellae, others obtain their food by simply capturing small floating animals with their tentacles. From their interaction with the zooxanthellae, the Cirrhipathes obtain essential molecules and in return, protection and access to sunlight are provided to the zooxanthellae. Furthermore, important habitats that house numerous species of marine organisms are formed by these corals. It is even believed that the survival of two species of shrimp depends entirely on these corals.

It is in the Pleopsidium genus of the Acarosporaceae family. This lichen is one of the few species able to survive at high altitudes in Antarctica, at altitudes of up to . It is able to cope with high UV, low temperatures and dryness. In its Antarctic habitat, it can be found on the surface, but it is mainly found in cracks, where just a small amount of scattered light reaches it. This is probably an adaptive behaviour to protect it from UV light and desiccation. It remains metabolically active in temperatures down to -20 C, and can absorb small amounts of liquid water in an environment with ice and snow. It is of especial interest for astrobiology since this is one of the most Mars like environments on the Earth. In a 34-day experiment when placed in a Mars simulation chamber, it continued to photosynthesize, and it adapted to Mars conditions and even adapted physiologically by increasing its photosynthetic activity, and producing new growth.

The church is approximately 300 metres from Jalan Besar MRT station. Founded in 1894, KKMC is one of the first Peranakan churches and the fourth Methodist church to be established in Singapore. During its early years, the church catered to the Peranakan or Straits-born Chinese, with services conducted in Baba Malay in a building located on 155 Middle Road. In 1930, the church moved to its current site on 1 Kampong Kapor Road, where it now offers a variety of services to different ethnic groups. The church building on Kampong Kapor Road was given conservation status by Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1989; its earlier building on 155 Middle Road was awarded historic site status in 2000. The church celebrated its hundredth anniversary in January 1994. History Founded as a church in 1894, Kampong Kapor Methodist Church began its activities in November 1890, in the lower room of the Deaconess Home. Upon request, Miss Sophia Blackmore, a missionary to Singapore (and also the founder of the Fairfield Methodist Schools and the Methodist Girls' School) started a Sunday Malay language worship service. The group comprised 25 “native” girls from the mission hostel, boys from Epworth Home (precursor of the Methodist Youth Fellowship), Malay-speaking Christian workers from the nearby Mission Press and two missionaries. Miss Sophia Blackmore On 25 January 1894, this group moved to “The Christian Institute” located on 155 Middle Road to function as a church. At 7.30pm that evening, six full and 16 preparatory members were organised as the first Malay Quarterly Conference chaired by the presiding elder, Rev. R.W. Munson. The “Malay Church” was formed with Cpt. Rev. William Shellabear undertaking pastoral charge. Three days later, the Sunday school was officially organised with about 40 students. “Sunday” school was also carried out on weekdays as well. Rev. Shellabear and about a dozen young men held street and kampong meetings in Malay. Meanwhile, Miss Blackmore and her team of women as well as the women missionaries made a deep impression on Nyonya women and their children as they distributed tracts, sang hymns, visited several hundred “native” Straits-born Chinese women in their homes and held Sunday School for “native” children in their homes and along five-foot ways. The church soon outgrew its Middle Road premises and a new building was constructed on Kampong Kapor Road. It was completed in 1930 and the church became known as The Straits Chinese Methodist Church (Bishop Bickley Memorial). This reflected the largely Chinese membership and the vast donations which the family and friends of Bishop George Harvey Bickley made for the construction of the building. In 1957, the Board of Stewards decided that since the church not only catered to the spiritual needs of the Straits- born Chinese but also to the other ethnic groups as well, the church should be known as Kampong Kapor Methodist Church (Bishop Bickley Memorial). It has retained this name ever since. Buildings The building which was once occupied by the church on 155 Middle Road still exists to this day. It now houses Objectifs — the Centre for Photography and Films. The church’s first place of worship on 155 Middle Road. The present church building dates from 1929, and was designed by Swan and Maclaren, the oldest architectural firm in Singapore. Over the years, the church has undergone major renovation and rebuilding works to cater to the growing congregation without affecting the main features of the church. The church was recently renovated in 2000, when emergency structural works were necessary, as the construction of the nearby North East MRT Line caused the foundations of the building to shift, causing large cracks to appear on the walls of the sanctuary. The foundations of the sanctuary were underpinned, and the church also took the opportunity to renovate the education block, reconfiguring parts of it to create a new chapel and classrooms on the third floor. While the church was closed, worship services were held at the Anglo-Chinese Primary School, Ah Hood Road (which was also at a temporary location, as the school's Barker Road campus was being rebuilt). The present building is in a stripped-back Art Deco, incorporating elements from the earlier styles of Gothic architecture, which is clearly seen in the spire of the bell tower, as well as the finials that occur on all the original façades and tower. The ornamentation is simple but delicate, and is derived from the shape of the cross, with the finials, tower windows and exterior walls' ornament all derived from it. This motif continues inside. The interior of the sanctuary is simple and elegant, with dark wooden trusses springing gracefully from cross-shaped brackets on the walls between round clerestory windows. At the apex of the roof, a further clerestory window admits more daylight. Originally a single nave with side aisles, the sanctuary is now L-shaped, incorporating a hall which was originally screened off by doors. The design of the pews is based on the original rattan-backed pews which they replaced. Aerial view of Kampong Kapor Methodist Church. The 1928 building is on the left; the education block (c. 1980s) is on the right The altar and pulpit were originally in an apse at the end of the church, surrounded by wood paneling on the walls, with a cross-shaped window above it and flanked by two arched windows, but this is now occupied by the pipe organ which was introduced in 1936. Earlier designs for the church included a gallery and an enclosed organ chamber, but these were not included in the final design. The interior has undergone several renovations, including (a rather unsuccessful) one in the 1960s, when the entire apse was screened off by a plasterboard wall. The changes from that renovation have all been since undone. The altar, ambo and font are now on a dais just in front of it, surrounded by a communion rail. The tower is eighty-eight feet tall, and contains four bells cast in the Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry, which are hung dead for stationary chiming. The street-facing façade of the sanctuary building originally had three portals: one at each aisle, and a central portal with a large porte cochère, but none of these remain. It is unclear why the original porte-cochère was demolished, but it is thought to be because the government intended to widen the road. In its place, the window over the central entrance has been enlarged and now contains stained glass, and the sanctuary is now access via the main entrance of the education block. The road widening clearly did not require the demolition of the porte cochère, as the strip of land in front of the church was subsequently returned, unused, in the 2000s, but there are no plans to re-instate the original entrances. This strip is now enclosed by a fence, which the Church built in order to enclose the newly returned piece of land. KKMC also owns a three-storey shophouse next to the church which is called The Unfailing Light. The place is used for the church's Youth, Seniors Ministries as well as the Homework Centre. Occasionally, it is also used for special sermons and courses. Pipe Organ The church is home to one of the few working pipe organs in Singapore, and is the only Methodist Church in Singapore to have one. The organ was the gift of the Ladies’ Aid Society. It was built by Walker & Taylor, Lincoln, England, in 1936 and installed in the church in 1937. The façade bears a strong resemblance to the organ in the chapel at Orchard Road Presbyterian Church. The organ originally had tracker action and mechanical stop and coupler controls. In 1987, when the Education Block was constructed and the sanctuary was renovated, the organ was completely dismantled and stored in a warehouse. After the renovation, it was rebuilt and raised to its present height. A new console replaced the original, and the swell box was removed to accommodate more ranks. The action was also electrified to accommodate the enlargements to the organ. However, the organ's original slider wind chests were retained. In 1995, platforms were included on both sides of the organ to allow for more pipes to be added. The new ranks of pipes that have been added over the years include the Great Mixture, mutations in the Swell, the reed stops (Trumpet 8' and Clarion 4') and the Subbass 16' in the Pedal. The organ continues to be integral with the music of the church, and is played during the Sunday morning services. Robert Navaratnam, at one time Singapore's only organ builder, has been responsible for the renovations, maintenance and tuning of the organ.

Adam Morgan from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review from the film and its cinematography: \\"The film is beautifully composed and full of striking images, but Acevedo's ruthless depiction of hardship makes this hard to watch\\". Peter Debruge from Variety wrote: \\"Cesar Acevedo's deliberately paced and distant-feeling debut works its way under audiences' skin, weaving a haunting allegory through painterly compositions.\\".

Personal life Modi was born in a Gujarati Hindu family and is a vegetarian,He is married but publicly acknowledged the marriage only in April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power.His spouse is Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged for more than fifty years. Quote: \\"Marriage: Jashodaben (Chimanlal) Modi (1968-present, separated); Entered into an arranged marriage as a teenager to Jashodaben Chimanlal. When he filed his nomination for prime minister, he was forced to acknowledge the marriage after almost 50 years of claiming to be single.\\" He is a lifelong member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its political arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Modi became a 'Pracharak' (missionary worker) of the RSS in early 1970s.Since becoming a prachark, Modi has either cut down or reduced ties to his family per the RSS rules. He has never politically helped any members of his family. Members of his immediate and extended family lead simple middle class lives. Modi donates big chunk of amount for different government related schemes. He always auctions gifts received. He has raised Rs 89.96 crore by auctioning all gifts he received as chief minister of Gujarat and donated this to the Kanya Kelavani Fund. After becoming PM, he has contributing to public causes ranging from Girl Child Education to Clean Ganga to welfare of underprivileged. These donations have now exceeded 103 crores and most of that comes from auctions of the gift he has received and from his personal savings. After promoting Yoga in his 2015 address to the UN, Modi has been holding the International Day of Yoga every year on Northern Summer solstice which falls on 21 June,with participation by millions of people throughout world. Perception through the years Journalist Ashis Nandy, who is also a trained psychologist, was one of the first to interview Modi when the latter was an RSS pracharak at the height of the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign in the early 1990s. At that time in Modi, he found \\"a classic, clinical case of a fascist\\".Nandy, A., 2002. Obituary of a Culture. Journal of Future Studies, 7(1), p.101. Soon after becoming the chief minister of Gujarat, the state was convulsed by sectarian riots in 2002.The complicity, at that time, of Modi's government in the pogrom against the Muslim minorities made Modi a pariah for many years. The United States and many European countries imposed denied visa to Modi after the riots.These remained in force for a long period and lifted shortly before he became prime minister in 2014 Soon after the Gujarat riots, Modi embarked on a strategy to make the state a friendly place to set up business.This led to him being dubbed as Vikaspurush (Development man). This was the main theme during his successful campaign in 2014. Communication strategies Modi has used multiple strategies to build up his image.These include use of Social media, government media outlets, and a distinct attire.The machinery for this works also includes ad makers,speechwriters and assorted spinners managing Modi's image and campaigns. Social media One of the main strategies used by Narendra Modi and his government has been the extensive use of Social media to directly communicate with the public. In September 2014 Modi became the second-most-followed leader in the world with 5 million Twitter subscribers. Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi was the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 30 million followers on Twitter, as of June 2017 behind only Barack Obama. For the 2014 elections, The BJP's National Digital Operations Centre (NDOC) led a group of volunteers for the social media campaign.The volunteers were charged with trolling and attacking mainstream journalists considered unfavorable to Modi. The group was headed by Arvind Gupta. Gupta joined the team in 2009 and for 2014 election campaign, he was in charge of websites, uploading videos of rallies and meetings, distributing them to media houses, and posting comments and releases and trolling opponents online. Mann ki Baat Modi's use of social media has been at the expense of traditional media such as Television and print media.He rarely gives interviews or holds a press conference.Plagemann, J. and Destradi, S., 2019. Populism and foreign policy: The case of India. Foreign Policy Analysis, 15(2), pp.283-301. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has also been hosting a monthly monologue called Mann Ki Baat on the government owned All India radio and Doordarshan.His supporters applaud the use of an old fashioned medium like radio to promote positive social causes while his detractors call it another propaganda tactic by Modi to reach out to millions of people untouched by the internet. Media intimidation Modi has been called a controversial, polarising and divisive figure by many media sources. There are reports that Modi and his government are highly anxious to avoid negative media attention. Journalists and public figures have lost their jobs following criticism of Modi.  Optics and Attire  Modi has been called a fashion leader in India, and his clothing choices have been discussed internationally. Recognition of his sartorial style is a major part of his public image. The type of vest regularly worn by Modi have become popular, and called as Modi Jackets. https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/three-years-and-counting-modi-jackets- remain-hot-favourites-with-consumers-2358289.html In January 2015 while receiving United States President Barack Obama in a state visit at the Hyderabad House, Modi wore a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes. The suit was gifted to him. Modi's political opposition criticized his wearing the suit, complaining that he campaigns on an image of coming from a poor background and living without money while at the same time wearing luxury products such as this suit. Other commentators said that in choosing this suit Modi was being a parvenu, at the height of vanity, going to a ridiculous extreme, and political opposition party leader Jairam Ramesh said that he was a megalomaniac. A month later the suit was auctioned for and amount was which was directly donated to Clean Ganga Mission. Journalist Siddharth Varadarajan commented on the public support for the auction by saying \\"the manner in which Mr. Modi's leadership has been projected is extremely unhealthy in any democratic society\\". What was noticeable was that though Modi had not payed a penny for the suit material and also the making which was done free of cost by Jade Blue, he still managed to auction the suit for US$695,000 and contributed the entire amount for Clean Ganga project. Modi's usual attire is a kurta and vest, and his half-sleeve kurta is sometimes called the Modi Kurta. The prime minister's clothes are made of silk or cotton, are crisply ironed and are handmade in Gujarat. When he was chief minister he wore bold, bright colours, changing to pastels as prime minister. For holidays, Modi wears a traditional turban from wherever he is. Some of his clothing has been created by Bollywood fashion designer Troy Costa. In 2009, Modi's clothing was said to be Bollywoodesque and indicative of Gujarat's modernism. According to Vogue India editor Priya Tanna in a New York Times blog, \\"Never before has there been such a strong convergence between what a politician in India stands for and his clothing.\\" Tanna called his clothing choice \\"100% India\\": democratic, supportive of Indian industry (separating him from politicians in Western suits), emblematic of his humble birth, clean and hygienic. Responding to Tanna, another commentator said that Modi's fashion choice has no particular meaning and there is no need to interpret it. Modi also likes to don the orange (bhagwa) robes of a Hindu sanyasi for photo opportunities. At the end of the election campaign in May 2019, he travelled to a mountain cave in the Himalayas at Kedarnath for meditation.He was heavily mocked by national and international media for conducting his meditation (tapasya in Sanskrit) in a cave that had an attached toilet, a heater, a bathing area, an electric geyser, a telephone, WiFi, and a grand view. A cameraperson was allowed to record the session.  Awards and recognitions  In a nationwide survey concerning Indian Chief Ministers, Modi was named Best Chief Minister in 2007 by India Today. In March 2012 Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of Time, one of the few Indian politicians to have done so, and made the 2014 Time 100 list of the world's most influential people. He has become the most followed Asian leader on Twitter, and in 2014 was ranked the 15th-most-powerful person in the world by Forbes. In 2015, Modi was one of Times \\"30 most influential people on the internet\\" as the second- most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook. In 2015, Modi was ranked 5th on Forbes magazine's list of 'World's Greatest Leaders'.Modi was featured in the cover story titled \\"India's Divider in Chief\\" in the May 2019 issue of Time magazine. Modi has received various honours from other countries. Popularity In November 2017, a survey of Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the \\"by far\\" most popular figure in Indian politics. In this survey Modi at 88% was ahead of Rahul Gandhi (58%), Sonia Gandhi (57%) and Arvind Kejriwal (39%).

Unlike heterotaxy syndrome, the absent spleen (asplenia) is not associated with other structural developmental defects. In some cases the spleen is present, but very small and nonfunctional (hyposplenism).  Immunodeficiency  The spleen is an organ within the lymphatic system and its primary function is to filter blood. However, the spleen also plays a key role in immune responses as it detects pathogens within the blood and secretes phagocytes to fight potential infection.

The school was established in 1840 for children aged 4 to 11, and closed in 2006 with just 9 pupils. The site has since been converted into affordable housing. The school was renowned for its rural setting with large grounds for children to play in, and for providing a wide range of extra-curricular activities including: football, hockey, rounders, athletics, swimming, roller-blading and cricket. The school also provided an unusually wide range of opportunities including: canoeing, climbing, gorge walking, fell walking, orienteering and problem solving activities.  History  The school was founded to cope with the dramatic increase in the population of the area as workers settled to man the three new bobbin mills constructed during the Industrial Revolution. Although both Satterthwaite and Rusland already had chapels serving as primary schools they were not able to cope with the increased student numbers. Animosity between residents meant that parents from Rusland refused to let their children go to school in Satterthwaite and vice versa, so a new building site was offered equidistant from the two chapels, in an isolated spot just within the bounds of Satterthwaite. In order to found the school the parish set up a building fund, notable for the donation of 1 shilling made by the famous poet William Wordsworth. Satterthwaite and Rusland National School, the name under which it was founded, could accommodate 100 pupils, although the student count never exceeded 80. The building and grounds were large, including a spacious nine- roomed house attached for the master. In 1855 a government inspector described the school as \\"the best country school in the country\\", whilst other reports say that the pupils excelled in mathematics and were also reciting poetry and performing Shakespearean plays.

City of Boston Archives The Playland Café (1937-1998), located at 21 Essex Street in Boston, Massachusetts, was Boston's oldest gay bar.According to Improper Bostonians, the bar opened in 1938. According to the owner, as reported in a Boston Globe story (Kindleberger, 1998), it opened in 1937. History According to Paul Staffier, when his father Rocco Staffier opened Playland in 1937 it was not a gay bar, but by the start of World War II it had begun attracting a gay clientele. When the bar closed in 1998, Staffier, who had run Playland for 40 years, said that it was not the \\"den of iniquity\\" it was reputed to be, and that arrests had been rare. Over the years it was mentioned only a few times in the Boston Globe.Boston Globe archives, 2015 1930s-1940s In the early days of the bar's operation, a mural on the wall depicted Playland regulars hobnobbing with movie stars. Dancers, singers, and other performers provided entertainment. A well-known lesbian performer, Marie Cord, frequented the bar and sang there. Since Boston's blue laws prohibited drinking at the bar on Sundays, at the stroke of midnight on Saturday employees would block access to the barstools and set out folding chairs, thus complying with the letter of the law. One bartender, Jim McGrath, worked at Playland for 38 years.The History Project (1998), p. 166. 1950s According to historian Neil Miller, the crowd at Playland in the 1950s was surprisingly diverse for its time, both racially and in terms of class. \\"Blue-collar truck drivers mingled with Harvard students.\\" In 1954, disturbed by reports of underage drinking by teenagers, authorities conducted undercover inspections of several Boston bars over a period of two and a half weeks. During that time, one teenager was spotted in the Playland Café and 17 were spotted in the Golden Nugget, the strip club next door. The following year, citing concerns about teenage drinking, the U.S. military declared Playland and ten other Boston bars off-limits to servicemen. Oddly enough, the blacklist did not include the Golden Nugget. It did include the Punch Bowl, the Touraine, the Melody Bar, and the Mardi Gras, all gay or \\"mixed crowd\\" bars.The History Project (1998), p. 161. The \\"Combat Zone\\" years The Playland Café was in a part of town that became known in the 1960s as the Combat Zone. The bar was popular with drag queens. Writing in 2007, Boston Globe reporter Robert Sullivan recalled it as \\"a Combat Zone bar known for its sketchy clientele, banged-up piano, and year-round Christmas lights.\\" Playland was linked to a notorious murder trial in 1995. Chanelle Pickett, 23, an African-American trans woman, met William Palmer, a white computer programmer, at Playland. She and another trans woman left the bar with Palmer, and the three of them spent some time snorting cocaine at Pickett's apartment. Pickett then accompanied Palmer to his home, where, according to the medical examiner, Palmer beat her about the head and strangled her for over eight minutes. At his trial, Palmer claimed he had no idea Pickett was a trans woman until they began having sex; when he rejected Pickett, according to him, she attacked him and he was forced to defend himself. Other Playland patrons said that Palmer was a regular there, and had a well-known attraction to pre-op transsexuals. The defense portrayed Palmer as a naive dupe and Pickett as a cunning and dangerous \\"gender shape-shifter\\". Palmer was convicted of assault and battery but acquitted of murder, and sentenced to two years in prison. In 1998, Playland still reportedly drew \\"the city's most eclectic crowd by age, class, race, and dress size.\\" By then it had been in continuous operation for 60 years, making it Boston's oldest surviving gay bar. The bar lost its entertainment license in April 1998 after undercover police officers reported that drug dealers were using it as a base. The building was sold to developer Kevin Fitzgerald that September, and has since been demolished. Jacques Cabaret, which opened in 1938 and is still in operation, is now Boston's oldest surviving \\"LGBT establishment\\". It became a gay bar in the mid-1940s, a lesbian bar in the 1960s, and a venue for drag performers in the 1970s.

United States   Croissan'wich  The Croissan'wich is a family of breakfast sandwiches sold by the fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. It was introduced in 1983. The Croissan'wich, a portmanteau of the words croissant and sandwich, was introduced in 1983, as part of a menu expansion and as attempt to differentiate BK's breakfast line from McDonald's. Before this, BK's breakfast line was almost identical to McDonald's in composition. In the U.S., the standard Croissan'wich consists of a sausage patty, bacon, or ham; eggs; and American cheese on a croissant. * The Double Croissan'wich with sausage, bacon, egg and American cheese (The Double tag refers to two meat portions on the sandwich) * The Western Croissan'wich ham, sauteed onions, eggs and American cheese * The Hawaiian Croissan'wich spam, eggs, sausage, sold in Hawaii. Internationally it is sold as either the Croissan'wich or the Croissant Sandwich, but the base composition of the sandwich varies; in New Zealand bacon is the primary meat and in Argentina where ham is the primary meat. It also sold in Korea and Taiwan, but sausage is not offered.  Supreme Breakfast Sandwich  The Supreme Breakfast Sandwich (formerly the Enormous Omelet Sandwich) is a breakfast sandwich sold by the fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. It consists of sausage patties, bacon, eggs and American cheese on a sesame seed bun. The Meat'normous Omelet Sandwich was a variant on the Enormous Omelet Sandwich that added a portion of ham to the sandwich. It is one of their late teen to young adult male oriented products. The sandwich attracted criticism for its high fat and caloric content, and was discontinued in the United States for a short while. It is still sold in some of its international markets. The sandwich was re-introduced at US restaurants in 2016, albeit under a new name, entitled the Supreme Breakfast Sandwich. The sandwich was introduced on March 28, 2005 as the Enormous Omelet Sandwich, and attracted significant media attention for its ingredients and caloric content. It was the first new product launched under the auspices of then CEO Greg Brenneman, and helped boost Burger King breakfast sales by 20%.CEO turns the flame up, USA Today, May 23, 2005. The Meat'normous Omelet Sandwich was introduced in May of the same year. Because of its large serving size and high fat and caloric content, the sandwich garnered negative press when first sold.Burger King to offer whopper of a breakfast sandwich By Bruce Horovitz, USA TODAY 28 March 2005 The negative press was compounded when Burger King began selling the companion Meat'normous sandwich.Word of the day: Meat'Normous SpokesmanReview.com (Spokane, WA) 26 September 2005  Ham omelet   BK Breakfast Muffin   Burgers for Breakfast  Lunch items such as hamburgers and fries were not traditionally served during breakfast time, however, some BK stores began selling food under their \\"Burgers for Breakfast\\" program which began in 2000.  BK Breakfast Shots   Advertising  When the Croissan'wich was first introduced, television advertisements used a young woman in a BK uniform announcing the new product and having consumers on the street compare it to McDonald's Egg McMuffin much like the Pepsi Challenge. Later advertisements followed up on this by incorporating the slogan \\"Croissan'wich beat the stuffin' out of Egg McMuffin\\". Enormous Omelet Sandwich in wrapper Burger King again used the viral marketing ads featuring the \\"Creepy King\\", who presented the product to unsuspecting consumers in unexpected places such as their own bedroom or in their front yards. It was promoted with the slogan \\"Wake up to a mouthful of breakfast with the Enormous Omelet Sandwich.\\" The television advertisements described the sandwich like this: > Two slices of melted, American cheese, two fluffy eggs stuffed with three > crispy strips of bacon, and a sizzling sausage patty, piled high on a > toasted bun. The Enormous Omelet Sandwich from BURGER KING. So big, > breakfast will never be the same. The tag line for the Meat'normous was similar: > Meat on top of meat, on top of meat… Wake up to a mouthful of breakfast with > the Meat’normous Omelet Sandwich. Two slices of melted American Cheese, two > fluffy eggs, three crispy strips of bacon, two sizzling sausage patties and > two slices of ham, piled high on a toasted bun.

Early career Richardson was born in Sydney, and spent several seasons as a batsman in the New South Wales team, scoring 473 runs at an average of 22.52 in 15 matches between 1886–87 and 1894-95. His highest score was 75 not out against South Australia in 1892-93 in his first Sheffield Shield match; it was also the highest score in the match, which New South Wales won by an innings. He moved to New Zealand late in 1897 to take charge of the New Zealand office of the Mutual Life Association of Australasia, and played his first match for Wellington a few days later, scoring 77 in an innings victory over Canterbury.Wisden 1950, p. 912. He was selected to tour Australia with the New Zealand team in 1898-99, but was unable to obtain leave from his work to make the trip.Don Neely & Richard Payne, Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985, Moa, Auckland, 1986, p. 40. He captained Wellington in two matches in 1899-00, and scored 113 in the match against Otago, reaching his century on 1 January 1900, thus becoming the world's first first-class century-maker of the 1900s. He and Frederick Midlane, who reached his century during the previous day's play and ended up scoring 149, added 207 for the fourth wicket. Playing for New Zealand Richardson played his first match for New Zealand a few weeks later against the touring Melbourne Cricket Club. Although Melbourne did not have first-class status, they were too strong for New Zealand, winning by an innings. In the second innings, Richardson, batting at number three, scored 114 not out in a total of 246, the first time anyone had scored a century for New Zealand. He was appointed New Zealand's captain for their next series, two matches against Lord Hawke's XI in 1902-03. However, apart from winning the toss in both matches he had little success, scoring 44 runs in two losses by large margins.Neely & Payne, pp. 43-44. He did not play for New Zealand again. Dan Reese, who scored a century in the second match, later said, \\"no more likeable man has led New Zealand sides; he was also an able leader\\".Dan Reese, Was It All Cricket?, George Allen & Unwin, London, 1948, p. 145. Later career He captained Wellington in his last first-class match in 1906-07, against the MCC. For some years he held the record for the number of runs scored in a season of Wellington club cricket: 553.Auckland Star, 27 November 1913, p. 2. He later served on the selection panel for Wellington.Free Lance, 20 February 1909, p. 18. His younger brother William also played for New South Wales, from 1887 to 1896.

Cambodia has had a history of violence against women especially due to its past conflicts. During the Pol Pot regime, women were exposed to several different violent acts against them such as forced marriages and rape by the Khmer Rouge officials in Cambodia and refugee camps in Thailand. Presently, there is still a number of different forms of exploitation and discrimination against women in Cambodia such as rape, domestic violence, and human trafficking as the country is recovering from the history of conflict. Domestic violence There is a tradition of subservience and inferiority of women to men that makes the issue of domestic violence in Cambodia a complex issue. The traditional code of conduct Chbab Srey (Women's Law) had taught women in Cambodia to be subservient to men. Up until 2007 schools in Cambodia had taught the chbab to the young girls in regards to what was expected from them as a women. Domestic violence in Cambodia has been identified as having increased in scope and intensity after Pol Pot's control. In 2008, the national survey showed that over one quarter of women in Cambodia suffered from domestic violence. The traditional view that women are subservience and inferior makes the issue of domestic violence in Cambodia a complex issue. There is a common saying in Cambodia which expressed the status of inequality between men and women, “Men are gold and women are cloth”. The traditional code of conduct Chbab Srey (Women's Law) somewhat teaches women in Cambodia to be subservient to men. The chbab cautions about leaving girls unsupervised or giving them too much independence and freedom. Up until 2007, the Chbab was taught within school's curriculum for how women should behave. In a 2014 study, it was shown that the general attitude towards women to stay at home to take care of their children and husband was at 78%. One of the reasons for a woman to stay in a domestic violent relationship is because of the economic reliance on the man. Generally the men are the predominant income earner in the household, this is extremely common for males in rural areas. 66% of participants in the 2014 survey believed that the wives should remain silent when domestic violence occurred in order to keep the family unit together. National legal mechanism In 2005, Cambodia introduced the legislation called Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence and the Protection of Victims. In Article 1 of the statute, it provided that the aim was to prevent domestic violence and protect the victims. Article 13 provided some guidelines for authorities in terms of intervention such as offering shelter to the victim, mediating, as well as educating both parties in order to reduce domestic violence from reoccurring. Under Article 16, the victim can file to the Courts for a Protection Order. Article 35, provided that the perpetrator can be charged under the Cambodian penal laws. However, under Article 36, the victim can request for the charges to be dropped if the offences was “minor misdemeanors or petty crimes”. One of the issue with the domestic violence law in Cambodia is that it is seen as a luxury which women who are of a poor social economic background cannot afford. In terms of implementation of the domestic violence law there has been issues due to the economic dependence on the male as an income provider, so the women who may seek legal help then changes their mind due to this financial constraint. In a 2014 study, it showed that 92% of men and 90% of women indicated that they had knowledge of domestic violence laws. However, the study also showed that there was still confusion in regards to women rights. This was because the survey showed that only 26% of the participants actually knew about women's right to equal justice and protection. In 2013, Cambodia's Secretary of State for Ministry of Women's Affairs at the 57th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women issued a report in regards to Cambodia's efforts to tackle the issue of violence against women and girls. At a national level, Cambodia had developed the National Action Plan to Prevent violence against Women. One of the focus of the policy was to build on CEDAW. The aim of the program was to raise public awareness both at a commune and district level. The distribution of information such as laws and support services available to victims and survivors were through media campaigns and informational meetings. This has shown to be of some success as in the 2014 national survey showed that 95% of the participants had the source of knowledge about domestic violence law derived from mass media. In terms of the gap between domestic violence law within the country, there are several social and legal conditions which contribute to this. These factors includes: the structural gender inequality, discriminatory attitudes of gender, customs and traditions which are detrimental rather than supportive of domestic violence laws, a weak system of upholding the rule of law, and the inadequacy of financial as well as human resources to support the implementation and enforcement of domestic violence law training. Rape Rape is the most common and serious crime in Cambodia. In a UN report released in 2013 showed that 1 in 5 men in Cambodia between the ages of 18-49 had admitted that they had raped a woman. 15.8% of those who admitted to having committed a rape had done so when they were younger than 15 years old. “Bauk” is the term used in Cambodia for gang rape. More than double the men in Cambodia admitted to gang rape in comparison to India. Bauk has been described as an activity amongst Cambodian men as a means of male bonding. These young men would discuss and share their experiences with one another. Subsequently, Bauk has become a socially accepted form of recreation amongst young middle class Cambodian men. National legal framework Legally, rape or an attempt to commit the act is a crime in Cambodia. Rape has been defined as “any sexual act involving penetration carried out through cruelty, coercion or surprise”. The focus of the offence is not on the lack of consent, which means that the judges tend to look at elements of violence in order to convict. A failure to provide evidence of violence and a lack of medical evidence to support this has resulted in judges finding the penetration as consensual. In terms of the prosecution of the perpetrators, almost 50% of those that had admitted to rape were arrested, while only 28.3% faced imprisonment and 44% did not face any legal consequences. A large number of rapists have escaped criminal liability due to the fact that the occurrence of compensatory payments are made to either the victims or their family in return for waiving their right to complain to the authorities. Another issue with perpetrators not being held liable is due to the corruption within the courts and police. Rapists who are from a wealthy background can bribe law enforcement agents to turn a blind eye. Human trafficking See human trafficking in Cambodia. International legal mechanisms Cambodia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1992. Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are currently playing an active role in implementing CEDAW in Cambodia. The different type of work that the NGOs have been involved with includes policy and law reforms, health services, gender sensitisation, non-formal education and rights awareness programs. In 1995 the Cambodian NGO Committee on CEDAW (NGO CEDAW) was established to support the Cambodian Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Currently there are 79 NGOs members. Their main mission is to establish independent reports on the progress of implementation of CEDAW. Also the Cambodian Committee for Women (CAMBOW) was established in 2000 where their aim was to work alongside NGO CEDAW. CAMBOW is particularly focused on violence against women in Cambodia and used education, training, research and documentation to promote and protect women's rights.

Generally speaking, Western European militaries show a greater tendency toward inclusion of LGBT individuals. As of 12 April 2019, 19 countries allow transgender military personnel to serve openly: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Cuba and Thailand reportedly allowed transgender service in a limited capacity. In 1974, the Netherlands was the first country to allow transgender military personnel.  Debate about inclusion of transgender people in the military   Arguments against inclusion  There are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service. One argument is based on the view that being transgender is a mental illness, and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service. This argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals. This is especially pertinent in individuals who have had sex-reassignment surgery and are unsatisfied with the results; in such cases severe depression is prevalent.Clements T.I., Wicks R.E.,\\"Transsexualism and Flight Safety\\" Aerospace Medicine Branch Education USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force Base, Texas online Hormone therapy can affect mood and a sense of well-being, a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability. Besides the well-being argument of hormone treatment, complications may arise due to hormone treatments. Possible complications arising from estrogen and testosterone therapies include an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, myocardial infarction, breast cancer, fertility problems, stroke, abnormal liver function, renal disease, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis.Major Bunn S.A., Straight talk: The implications of repealing \\"Don't ask, Don't tell\\" and the rationale for preserving aspects of the current policy 203 MIL. L Rev. 207, 236 (2010) online Any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service, especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings. another concern is the cost to treat transgender members in the military. A small portion of transgender soldiers seek medical intervention, yearly 30 to 140 pursue hormone treatment and 25 to 100 have surgical reassignment surgery. It is estimated that a male-to-female transition can cost between US$7,000 and $24,000; female-to-male transition can exceed US$50,000.Sex Reassignment Surgery Encyclopaedia of Surgery, Retrieved 27 April 2015 The Defense Department’s yearly budget for healthcare is $6 billion, the numbers found in the study show the cost to treat service members with GD would fall between $2.4 million and $8.4 million, that is .04 to .14 percent of the military's annual healthcare budget.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/transgender-soldiers-photo- essay-180971015/ A further argument is that in order to have an effective, smooth-running military, there must be cohesion within the unit. It is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion. \\"The bonds of trust among individual service members\\" are vital.Kaplan D., Rosenmann A, Unit social cohesion in the Israeli military as a case study of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell, 33 Pol. Psychol. 419, 422 (2012)l There is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly, morale will be detrimentally affected. But this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations. Military service forces members into very intimate living quarters. Requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined.  Arguments for inclusion  By excluding a demographic from equal service, militaries are overtly intensifying the stigma of that group's civic inferiority.Binkin M., Eitelberg M.j., Blacks and the military, (1982) Washington, DC, Brookings Institution This is supported by the notion that all citizens are obligated to serve their nations if the need arises.Herek G.M., \\"Sexual orientation and military service: A social science perspective,\\" American Psychologist 48, no. 5 (1993) pp. 538-549 Allowing transgender military personnel to serve openly without fear of exclusion would be a huge step toward equality. It has been recognized by some academics that the inclusion of all LGBT personnel in the military is more than a mere human rights issue, it is argued that for militaries to survive in the twenty-first century diversity is critical. With advancements in the current understanding of human experience, sexual identity is now better understood. Where being transgender was once considered a paraphilic disorder, the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders places being transgender in a separate chapter, terming the condition gender dysphoria. It is argued that militaries that exclude transgender people on grounds of mental illness, whose policies pathologize gender dysphoria, are at odds with the current medical understanding. This argument requires that transgender personnel be treated by the same level of medical care as all other personnel, in accordance with established medical practice.Gale S.P. (co-chair), Shannon M. (co-chair), \\"Report of the Planning Commission on Transgender Military Service\\" A nonpartisan national commission offering implementation guidance for the inclusion of openly-serving transgender personnel in the US military (Aug 2014) Palm Centre Blueprints for sound public policy Experts argue that there is no empirical evidence that supports the argument that transgender people are unfit for service. Often cited are factors such as a supposed predisposition of transgender individuals to problems such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; this is countered by the prevalence of these same issues in the LGBT community, yet in many countries their service is not excluded.Carpenter: Why LGB people should care about trans bias in the military Tom Carpenter & Karen Ocamb, LGBt POV, (24 October 2012) Retrieved 28 April 2015 By creating a more accepting environment, distress that transgender personnel feel might be mitigated if they may serve openly with full support.Ross A., \\"The Invisible Army: Why the military needs to rescind its ban on transgender service members\\" 23 S. Cal. Interdisc. L.J. (2014) p.185 Whilst militaries often cite the high medical cost of transgender people, they fail to reconcile this argument with current standards with other service members. For example, militaries often allow hormone treatments for an array of reasons and conditions, besides gender dysphoria; a common hormone treatment being contraceptive. Furthermore, the often cited risks of cross hormone treatment are rare, and not likely to cause any significant issues to the military. Whilst the cost of gender reassignment surgery is high, it is suggested that fewer than 2% of transgender members per year will choose to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Perhaps one of the most supporting arguments is based on the experiences of the 18 countries that currently allow transgender service. Research on the impacts of allowing LGBT to serve openly in the Israeli Defense Forces, British Armed Forces, and Canadian Armed Forces found no necessary negative impacts on performance, unit cohesion or morality. The idea of unit cohesion can also be demonstrated by a social study conducted less than one year prior to the repeal of the ban preventing transgender personnel from serving openly in the United States military. Morten G. Ender, David E. Rohall, and Michael D. Matthews presented the American military academy, Reserve Officers Training Corps, and civilian undergraduates with a survey to assess the general attitude on the prospect of the transgender community serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. After statistical analysis, 50.8% of individuals disagreed with the ban. In regards to productivity, 72.6% of subjects say that transgender inclusion would have no impact on their ability to do their job. Finally, on the subject of visibility, 21.8% of those interviewed said they would want transgender individuals to tell them their gender preferences, 56.1% said no preference. Overall, based on this study one year prior to the ban, the majority of the people that participated in the survey showed overwhelming support towards the inclusion of the transgender community in the United States military. In October 2017, ruling that a renewed ban within the US military should not go into force, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly stated that the evidence presented up to that time showed that \\"all of the reasons proffered ... for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself\\".  Status of transgender people in the military by country   Australia  Eighteen years after the Australian Defence Force lifted their ban on gay and lesbian service, the ADF reversed policy that excluded transgender people from military service. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017. It is believed that the Australian Defence Force was the last agency whose policy specifically allowed for firing employees for transitioning gender. The ADF policy supports diversity in the military identifying LGBTI as a main priority, whose key objective is to position the ADF as an employer of choice, who as an organisation respects and supports the inclusion of gender diverse persons.Australian Government; Department of Defence: Our Identified Priorities retrieved 29 April 2015 In 2013 Australian law formally codified protections against discrimination based on gender identity by including federal protections for LGBTI in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.New protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status Australian Human Rights Commission, 1 August 2013; Retrieved 29 April 2015 There are approximately 15 transgender service member who are openly living as their identified gender,The Secret I Kept for 50 Years Australian Women's Weekly, Jan 2014, Retrieved 29 April 2015 with the support of ADF ranking officials who have been vocally committed to creating an inclusive and diverse military environment.

Canada  In 1997, Seargent Sylvain Durand became the first serving member of the Canadian Forces to transition from male to female, and became the first member of any military worldwide to transition openly while serving under the Flag. On Canada Day of 1998, the military changed her name from Sylvain to Sylvia and changed her sex designation on all of her personal file documents. In 1999, the military paid for her Sex Reassignment Surgery. Sylvia continued to serve and got promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer. When she retired in 2012, after more than 31 years of service, she was the assistant to the Canadian Forces Chief Communications Operator. As of 2014, Canada allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.

France  As of 2014, France allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017. In France, the military is sometimes initially more accepting of transgender service members than civilian authorities are, at least in some localities and jurisdictions, but they are also influenced by rulings of civilian courts which have strict requirements about changing identity documents. One service member was whipsawed by initially positive reception in the military, later overruled after a civilian court decision. In 2009, a transgender Adjutant in the French Air Force who had already served 18 years as a man, returned to her unit in Nancy as a woman after a sick leave. Her superiors took stock of the situation, and provided the necessary uniforms and military papers with her new name. Delphine Ravisé- Giard was reintegrated into the military smoothly and without incident. On the other hand, she had difficulties in civilian life, such as when presenting her driver's license, passport, or other papers. The military then issued a request to the Nancy to have her gender and name altered on her birth certificate, but their decision was negative based on the fact that she had not yet undergone sex reassignment surgery so her situation was reversible. A 1992 decision by the Cour de cassation (Court of Appeals) requires those wishing to change their legal documents to show proof of being diagnosed with \\"transsexual syndrome\\" which is listed as a long-term psychiatric disorder in France, and to have undergone surgical intervention, but the Adjutant declared that she had no \\"long-term psychiatric disorder\\", and any question about any surgical interventions she had or didn't have was her private affair. Her lawyer insinuated that the real reason for the denial had to do with her ability to still have a child, and that the court's objective was sterilization before they would accord a legal name and gender change. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the European Council said that a transgender person \\"seeking to have their gender identity legally recognized should not be forced to submit to sterilization or to any other medical treatment.\\" However, in December, following the District Court decision, Hervé Morin, the Minister of Defense, ordered her to turn in her military papers, which she did. Meanwhile, she discovered that the name on her pay stub reverted to her old name, that the military supplement that women service members receive for feminine undergarments had been removed, and that the military was even going to dock her pay for the supplement she received while serving two years as a woman.  Germany  As of 2014, Germany allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.  Iran  As of 2017, Iran requires all male citizens over age 18 to serve in the military except for transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating this exemption. This practice of identifying transgender individuals put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.IRAN 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT  Ireland  Commenting in July 2017 on the Trump administration's decision to roll back service in the U.S. military by openly transgender personnel, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said, \\"On the transgender ban, it is not something I agree with.\\" He further indicated that Ireland had never formally banned transgender military service and that he would not consider introducing such a ban.

The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.  Thailand  In Thailand, identity documents may not be changed. All males must show up for the military conscription event on draft day, and kathoeys are not exempt from this requirement. It is possible for kathoeys to get an exemption certificate that will allow them to avoid service, but they must still attend, in order to present the document and be dismissed. As a result, on draft day, lines of people awaiting processing may include transgender women in makeup and feminine attire, waiting along with the male draftees. Contrary to the wide impression of acceptance of transgender women in Thailand, many complain about being treated as second- class citizens, and of the stress of being undressed or publicly humiliated.  United Kingdom  As of 2014, the United Kingdom allowed transgender people to serve openly in its military forces. The policy of inclusion was reportedly still in effect in 2017.  United States  The United States' military policy previously allowed for exclusion of transgender people from service on medical grounds. While gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members were allowed to serve openly since 2011, transgender service members risked discharge if they did not pass as their assigned sex. This required that service members conceal their gender identities throughout service. It was estimated that in 2008–2009 there were approximately 15,500 transgender individuals either serving on active duty or in the National Guard or Army Reserve forces within the U.S. Military. A 2016 study, however, based on previous research estimated that only between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender individuals served on active duty and between 830 and 4,160 in reserve duty, with midrange figures of 2,450 in active duty and 1,510 in reserves. Regardless of how many transgender individuals are members or veterans of the United States Armed Forces, transgender individuals are between 2-5 times more likely to serve in the military than their cisgender (non-trans) counterparts, primarily due to the provision of both financial security and a sense of belonging to a community. These reasons contribute to the belief that the United States Armed Forces is one of the largest, if not the largest, employer of transgender Americans. A key controversy and concern for transgender service members is the use of military medical services to transition from one gender to another. = Barack Obama administration = On 22 August 2013, the day after her sentencing at an Army court-martial, U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning issued a public statement declaring herself to be a transgender woman.

Department of Defense regulations that ban transgender persons from US military service were repealed on 30 June 2016. Beginning on that date, otherwise qualified United States service members could not any longer be discharged, denied reenlistment, involuntarily separated, or denied continuation of service because of being transgender. = Donald Trump administration = On 26 July 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve in the US military. The following day, General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that openly transgender people will continue to be allowed to serve until Trump provides direction to James Mattis, the Secretary of Defense. The Palm Center released, on 1 August 2017, a letter signed by 56 retired generals and admirals opposing the proposed ban on transgender military service members. The letter stated that if implemented, the ban \\"would cause significant disruptions, deprive the military of mission-critical talent and compromise the integrity of transgender troops who would be forced to live a lie, as well as non-transgender peers who would be forced to choose between reporting their comrades or disobeying policy\\". On 9 August 2017, five transgender United States military personnel sued Trump and top Pentagon officials over the proposed banning of transgender people from serving in the military. The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect. Two major LGBT-rights organizations filed a petition in the United States District Court in Washington on behalf of the five transgender service members. Trump signed a presidential memorandum, dated 25 August 2017, directing the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security to submit an implementation plan by 21 February 2018, to reinstate the ban and halt the use of military funds for \\"sex reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel\\". On 30 October 2017, US District Judge Colleen Kollar- Kotelly barred the administration from excluding transgender people from military service in Jane Doe v. Trump, but did not address whether federal funds should be used to pay for sex reassignment surgery for service members. The ruling also stated that as far as could be seen, \\"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself\\". In November 2017, the Defense Health Agency for the first time approved payment for sex reassignment surgery for an active-duty US military service member. The patient, an infantry soldier who is a trans woman, had already begun a course of treatment for gender reassignment. The procedure, which the treating doctor deemed medically necessary, was performed on 14 November at a private hospital, since US military hospitals lack the requisite surgical expertise. On 11 December, Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the government must accept transgender recruits into the military by 1 January 2018. After the ruling, the Department of Justice appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to issue a stay on the district court's ruling. The Pentagon confirmed on 26 February 2018 that the first transgender recruit had signed a contract to join the military. On March 23, 2018, President Trump banned transgender and transsexual people with current or previous gender dysphoria from serving in the U.S. military. However, the Pentagon said they would comply with the court decision until it is reversed. The policy was stayed in Karnoski vs. Trump (Western District of Washington) on 13 April 2018, when the court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi- suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy. On January 22, 2019, the US Supreme Court allowed President Trump's transgender military ban to go into effect while the ban was litigated in lower courts.https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/politics/scotus-transgender- ban/index.html On March 12, 2019, acting Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist signed a directive to allow Trump's policy to take effect in 30 days.

It is the middle of three bridges where the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway switches from one side of the river to the other, the others being the L Street Bridge and the Shoreham Hill Bridge. The bridge is near the site of a historical river ford used by French soldiers traveling to Yorktown in 1781.Davis, Timothy (1992). History and Description, pp. 10–12, 62, 98, 101, 109 The bridge is reinforced concrete faced in mica schist.Miller, Marcia (1988). History and Description History The original 1908 plans had the parkway cross from the west to the east side of Rock Creek farther north, near Lyons Mill. Frederick Law Olmsted opposed having the parkway run on the east side north of Q Street, due to the extensive grading required to accommodate the steepness of the valley at that point. The retaining walls that were built to protect the parkway proved inadequate, as a 1935 landslide after a heavy rain partially blocked the parkway for the next two years. The section of the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway from P Street south to K Street was the last portion of the parkway to open, in 1935. Initially, there was no bridge directly connecting the new segment to the existing segment on the opposite side of the creek. Traffic had to exit the parkway and climb out of the valley to city streets, use the high- level P Street Bridge, and then descend back into the valley. The low-level bridge directly connecting the parkway segments and bypassing the high-level bridge was completed in 1936, and was the last original bridge constructed on the parkway. This completed the final link, allowing motorists to drive from Virginia Avenue to Rock Creek Park without any stoplights, leading to a rapid increase in commuter traffic that soon necessitated measures such as operating the entire parkway one-way during rush hour.

When the callistemons were moved to Melaleuca, Callistemon sieberi became Melaleuca paludicola. Description Melaleuca sieberi is a small tree with white, grey or brown papery bark which sometimes grows to a height of but more usually less than . Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, narrow elliptic to lance-shaped and tapering to a sharp point. The leaves are often covered with short, soft hairs, especially when young. The flowers are white or pinkish, arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes contain 5 to 20 groups of flowers in threes, or sometimes individual flowers, and are up to in diameter and long. The flower buds are woolly. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 11 to 25 stamens. Flowering occurs in the spring and is followed by fruit which are woody, cup- shaped capsules long in loose clusters.M. sieberi foliage and fruit Taxonomy Melaleuca sieberi was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Repertorium Botanices Systematicae. The specific epithet (sieberi) honours Franz Sieber who collected 645 plant specimens in the Sydney area in the early 1800s. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sieberi occurs in coastal areas of New South Wales north of Gosford to near Maryborough in Queensland growing in coastal heath in sand.

The idea is similar to the Soviet Stakhanovite icon. Model workers are selected in China by central and provincial-level departments. Some cities and large companies also have processes for selecting and praising model workers. The basic criteria for model workers are patriotism, \\"worship of science,\\" activities in environmental protection, and the pursuit of excellence. Model workers are often afforded privileges not available to other citizens or Communist Party members. \\"The possibility to become a model worker offered peasants and workers one of the few opportunities for upward mobility other than joining the army,\\" writes scholar Yu Miin-lin. Model workers have an easier time joining the Communist Party, and also to become a higher-level cadre, manager, or other leader. Notable model workers Hao Jianxiu, model worker in 1951 One of the earliest model workers was the teenage textile worker Hao Jianxiu (awarded 1951), who invented the \\"Hao Jianxiu Work Method\\". She was sent to study at East China Textile Engineering Institute and was elevated to the upper echelon of Chinese politics, serving as Minister of Textile Industry, secretary of the CPC Central Secretariat, and vice chair of the State Planning Commission. Ni Zhifu, model worker in 1959 Another prominent model worker was Ni Zhifu (awarded 1959), a fitter who invented the \\"Ni Zhifu drill\\". He was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal governments of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, and became a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China.

He was born in St Andrews, Fifeshire, Scotland. As a young lad he worked as a caddie, carrying the clubs of Old Tom Morris at St Andrews. Strath placed 14th in the 1878 Open Championship at Prestwick. He served as the first professional at Royal Troon Golf Club in Scotland from 1881–87. In June 1883, Strath increased the links at Troon to twelve holes. A further six holes were completed by 1885. Strath's brother—Davie Strath—was also a fine golfer with seven top-10 finishes in the Open Championship. His other brother, Andrew Strath, won the 1865 Open Championship. George had three brothers, one of which was not a professional golfer. Early life Green keepers and their equipment at Ilkley Golf Club. Tom Vardon stands far left, c. 1900. Strath was born on 1 October 1843, the son of Alexander Strath and Susan Strath (née Reid). He married Christina Ronald on 31 December 1868 in St Andrews, Scotland. They had at least one child, a daughter named Susan. At the time of his marriage, Strath was working as a ship carpenter but would soon thereafter start a career in golf. His first professional post was at the Glasgow Golf Club where he was well known for the great condition of his golf course, especially the wonderful putting surfaces. He moved to the north of England to become professional at Southport Old Links from 1888–92. He later served at North Manchester in 1894–95. Strath assisted in the design of Ilkley Golf Club (pictured left) which is the oldest club in West Riding and the third oldest in Yorkshire.Saywell 1990, p.1 A 9-hole course was established on Rombald's Moor at the request of Ben Hirst and Alfred Potter in June 1890. The location for the original 9-hole course was planned with assistance from Strath, who after leaving Royal Troon was the club professional at Southport Old Links. After leaving Southport he then took a job as professional at Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire from 1893–94.Saywell 1990, p. 1 He was an excellent club maker, making beautiful long-nosed woods. When Strath left Troon in 1887, Willie Fernie took over as professional and served the club for 37 years. Fernie was also from a St Andrews family and won the Open Championship in 1883. Emigration to the U.S. Strath and his wife Christina boarded the RMS Umbria and sailed from Liverpool, arriving in New York City on 28 September 1895. Prior to leaving Scotland, Christina had been ill and doctors recommended a change of climate for her recovery. Golf career He began his U.S. golf career quickly by entering the 1896 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. He shot rounds of 91-89=180 and finished well back from the leaders. After his arrival in the United States, Strath never made it a priority to be a tournament golfer, but rather he preferred the business side of the game by being a greens keeper and instructor, having no superiors in either of those categories. In late 1895 he laid out the links at Dyker Meadow Club in Brooklyn where George Low would later be posted. He left Dyker Meadow and took a post at Shelter Island in 1897. He later worked for a short time at Wee Burn Club in Darien, Connecticut, in 1901. While at Wee Burn he instructed such champions as Charles H. Seely, 3-time champion of Connecticut from 1901–3, and twice winner of the Metropolitan Amateur championship in 1905 and 1908. In 1909 Strath was appointed as president of the Eastern Professional Golf Association. While still posted at Wee Burn, Strath was the golf instructor to Genevieve Hecker who was the U.S. Women's Amateur national champion in 1901 and 1902. After his stint at Wee Burn, he spent one year at the Hillandale Golf Club in Stamford, Connecticut. He left Hillandale to design the Crescent Athletic Club links in Brooklyn where his tenure was from 1901 through 1918.

The website was launched in November 2010 with an initial coverage of six main cities in the region, and now covers fourteen different capitals and major urban areas. It is run by a collective of young journalists, graphic designers, photographers, and translators who come from diverse backgrounds and are either born in the region or chose to make it their home. Mashallah news was created in order to contrast mainstream news coverage in the area that focuses on geopolitics, war, and international politics. The founders are independent journalists who strive to tell the story of regions and people that have different narratives that had previously been neglected. Mashallah News aims to display what is playfully called disOriented information about urban life in places like Istanbul, Jeddah, Cairo, Tehran, Ramallah, Beirut and beyond, in stories that have important societal implications. The focus of these stories is on urban life, culture, and society; aspects of life that the mainstream media often ignores. Run by a core team of four editors and one graphic designer, as well as teams of contributors from across the region, Mashallah News gathers people with diverse experiences and skills to share less-told stories and inspiring work from a region in transformation. Creative get-togethers, workshops and a print version with ‘the best of’ stories are in the works, to extend the emerging alternative public sphere even further. Additionally, the team has also released a book, Beirut Re-Collected, featuring a series of \\"forgotten stories\\" from the city.http://mashallahnews.com/news/about/ Their Story The following is a poem from the Mashallah News Facebook page.

The pilgrimage dates back to 1676. Neviges was the home of a Franciscan monastery from 1675 until the end of 2019. A church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in 1728 became too small for the growing numbers of pilgrims in the 20th century. Inspired by the Second Vatican Council, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne was open to a radically new church building. Gottfried Böhm designed a building in brutalist style which won the cardinal's approval. It was consecrated in 1968, and also became known as the Mariendom and Wallfahrtsdom. It is the second largest church in the Diocese of Cologne, after the Cologne Cathedral. The concrete structure with an irregular roof and an interior like a forum became the architect's signature building, and is regarded as one of the important \\"spatial creations\\" in 20th-century architecture.  History of the pilgrimage  The place of the pilgrimage to Neviges was an apparition of Mary to the Franciscan friar Antonius Schirley in 1676. He performed his daily prayer before a small painting of Mary, when he heard a voice saying \\"Take me to the Hardenberg, I wish to be worshiped there!\\" (\\"Bring mich nach Hardenberg, da will ich verehrt sein!\\"). Schirley delivered the painting of Mary to a chapel in Hardenberg-Neviges. In 1681, , who had been severely ill and was healed, made a pilgrimage of thanks to Neviges. This was the beginning of the pilgrimage. In 1688, the Vicar General of the Diocese of Cologne officially sanctioned the pilgrimage, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of Mary. It was a decidedly counter-Reformation dedication in a mostly Protestant area. Neviges was home to a Franciscan monastery from 1675, which operated the pilgrimage until the end of 2019. A small new parish church was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in 1728. It became too small for the growing number, and after World War I, several plans for a new church were made but not carried out. After World War II, 300,000 pilgrims arrived each year, at times 10,000 on a single Sunday. A larger church was needed.  Church  The archbishop of Cologne, Cardinal Josef Frings, had attended the Second Vatican Council, which developed concepts about a congregation participating in the liturgy. He tried to introduce the ideas in his diocese, and saw the chance for a radically different church realising the new approach and large enough to hold the many pilgrims. Gottfried Böhm, an architect of many churches, designed a church for the Neviges site in 1963 and entered an international competition as one of 17 architects. He failed to win in a first round. Cardinal Frings was disappointed by the result of the competition. Böhm presented a revised model to the cardinal, who was then almost blind but could feel the model by touch and ultimately favoured it. Böhm won the commission in June 1964, and construction began in 1966. The church was consecrated on 22 May 1968. It is, after the Cologne Cathedral, the second-largest church in the diocese, with room for 6,000 visitors. The church is a concrete building in brutalist style, with a concrete roof that has been compared to tents, crystals, a rock and a town. The complex is reminiscent of an abstract cubist sculpture. The entrance hall, with a low ceiling, is kept dark, to make the altar, illuminated through large stained-glass windows, the brightest place. The floor plan shows a curved approach from the entrance opening towards the altar. The interior is intended to resemble a market place, following concepts of the Second Vatican Council. It was a radical transition from elaborately decorated churches with a separation of altar and congregation. Intimate rooms are available for private devotion: the Gnadenkapelle (Chapel of Grace) with the image of Mary, the Sakramentskapelle (Chapel of the Sacraments), and the Unterkirche (Lower Church) below the main hall.  Features  Böhm also designed the large windows, such as the green Schlangenfenster (Snake Window) and the red Rosenfenster (Rose Window), the rose being a repeated motif throughout the building. The Mariensäule (Mary's Column) holding the image of Mary, the altar and a high Sakramentshaus housing the Eucharist were designed by , a sculptor from Cologne. The church first had an electronic organ. A pipe organ was consecrated in May 2010. It was first built in 1976 by organ builders from Werl, Germany, for the Antoniuskirche in Hildesheim. It was transferred to Neviges in 2010 by Orgelbau Seifert from Kevelaer and expanded to include an additional six stops.  Reception  The architect became internationally known by the building of the Neviges church, which was discussed already during the building phase, similar to his father's of St. Engelbert in Cologne 30 years earlier. The Neviges church and the town hall of Bensberg, which was built at the same time, are regarded as his most mature concrete buildings, and were the basis for awarding him the Pritzker Prize for architecture. The architect realised the liturgical reform towards community, participation and transparency in the service (Gemeinschaft, Mitwirkung und Transparenz im Gottesdienst). The Neviges church became Böhm's signature piece. It has been regarded as one of the important \\"spatial creations\\" in 20th-century architecture.

A performance of the work lasts approximately 28 minutes. In the program notes to the Concerto for Orchestra, Rouse commented on the unique form of the piece, saying: Instrumentation The Concerto for Orchestra is scored for an orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), two clarinets, bass clarinet (doubling piccolo clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, timpani, percussion (four players), and strings. Reception Joshua Kosman of San Francisco Chronicle called the piece \\"...a boisterous, exhilarating concoction, in which fiercely patterned rhythmic explosions alternate with lyrical interludes headed by the strings, and as the title suggests, it's a display piece for the orchestra members.\\" Scott MacClelland of Metro Silicon Valley similarly praised the work, saying, \\"Christopher Rouse's Concerto for Orchestra, composed with dazzling virtuosity, gave Marin Alsop's musicians a showpiece of fierce demands and breathtaking execution. Like Bartók's eponymous opus, it challenges every member of the orchestra and rewards each with at least cameos.\\" MacClelland further remarked, \\"...for all the dizzying activity, colors and effects, Rouse delivered this commission with an idiomatic mastery of the instruments and categorical style integrity.

She was the author of an original pedagogy of peace inspired by the international institutions present in Geneva: the League of Nations and International Labour Organization. Her pedagogy is the basis for the International Baccalaureate. Biography Born Marie-Thérèse Charlotte Dupuy September 28, 1890, at 45 Rue d'Ulm in Paris, she was the daughter of Paul Dupuy (1856–1948), master supervisor, supervisor and secretary general from 1885 to 1925 of the École Normale Supérieure and Louise Marthe Lecoeur. Raised in the premises of the school of the rue d'Ulm, she met her husband; Fernand Maurette became a geographer and economist. They married on March 30, 1911, in Paris and in 1915 they had a son, filmmaker Marc Maurette. She moved to Geneva soon after her marriage with her husband, who in 1924 joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) at the request of his former prep school colleague Albert Thomas. In Geneva, she worked as an educator at the International School of Geneva, founded by local educators and officials of the League of Nations and the ILO. She led the school from 1925 until 1950 and influenced its teaching advocating education for peace, based on respect and openness to others and with a strong international orientation. In 1948 she published the main lines of her teaching following a request of the UNESCO in a booklet entitled \\"Do Education Techniques for Peace Exist?\\" She died June 25, 1989, in Paris at the age of 98. Pedagogy The pedagogy advocated by Marie-Thérèse Maurette is based on several elements: # The Synthetic Geography invented by her father Paul Dupuy or International Culture that introduces children first to a global image of the world (globe or world map) and to ignore for a time the country from which they come. They study the great elements regardless of frontiers to put the world into perspective. This knowledge is complemented by human geography, which includes demographics to introduce the concepts of relativity between countries and regions. # Teaching of national history begins much later than in most national schools. History is taught from twelve years old. First the world history is taught, then insertion of national history is done to its proper and relative importance. # The practice of two languages: French and English (official languages of the League of Nations), to practice the two modes of thinking inherent in these languages, and generally to understand the thinking of one's interlocutors. The IB draws heavily on the educational principles of Marie-Thérèse Maurette.

Huck denies that he has a wife or son and is finally let out of the hole. He cleans up and is immediately put on his first assignment back. Huck is unable to torture the man, and Charlie pulls a gun on him. He explains how command told him to kill him, but changes his mind and lets Huck go free. Charlie is shown talking to the mysterious man and tells him Huck is dead. Olivia comes back from the hospital and talks to Huck, explaining how she needs him to come back and that he saved her when she found him in the train station.

It is the longest continuously operational military facility in Australia since colonial settlement. Lancer Barracks is located on Smith Street in the Parramatta CBD, opposite Parramatta Railway Station. It has been home to the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, an armoured cavalry unit, since 1885. History Construction of Lancer Barracks commenced in 1818 and was completed in 1820. It was constructed to replace earlier buildings that were in a state of disrepair. Governor Lachlan Macquarie wrote to Earl Bathurst in 1817, stating that \\"a new barrack for the troops being also necessary at parramatta, the old one being almost in ruins and consequently very dangerous to be any longer inhabited by the soldiers, I purpose to have a new barrack erected there as soon as the hospital has been completed\\". After construction, Lancer Barracks was home to a number of different British infantry regiments while the colony expanded. When British troops were withdrawn in the 1850s, it was used by the police and government, until it became home to the Lancers in 1891. The barracks became a hub of the regiment and the city, being the base from which the Lancers trained to travel first to England, and then to fight in the Boer War. Slowly, the barracks was modernised and preserved as a distinctive part of the area's colonial and military heritage. A number of memorials have been consecrated on the site to remember those who served at Lancer Barracks and were killed in conflicts. The buildings were heritage listed as protected against demolition in 1977. A heritage management plan is place to preserve the barracks for future generations. Buildings The Barracks, in its current form, consists of a number of operational buildings and workspaces. Of note, these include: * The Two-Storey Building, or '100-Man Block' * Bob's Hall, a single-story colonial building * Linden House, home to the Regiment's Museum and Association * Regimental Headquarters (Vernon House) * The Drill Hall & Frank Tattersall Stables (the Other Ranks bar) * The Officer's Mess Building * The Sergeant's Mess Building * Parade Ground * The Lancer Band Rehearsal Studio Museum Linden House Museum The Barracks is home to the Lancer Association Museum, in historic Linden House. It is open to the public on Sundays, and is run by the Lancer Association. A dedicated group of volunteers help to maintain and preserve the wealth of historic documents, artefacts, and armoured vehicles. The Museum Building was commemorated in 1981 as a memorial to all those who served with the Lancers.

The novel is set in Australia in 1967.  Plot introduction  In a class of only eleven schoolgirls, the young and enthusiastic teacher Miss Renshaw disappears after an unexpected excursion to the Gardens. There, they meet the mysterious Morgan and take a trip into a deep, dark cave. The girls return to school that day without a teacher. And so, Miss Renshaw is declared missing while the rest of the teachers scramble to get an answer. Only, Miss Renshaw told the schoolgirls never to tell what happened that day. Bethany breaks her promise in the end under pressure from Mr Dern. Eventually a news report is released with details of Morgan’s past and Miss Renshaw is declared dead.  Plot summary  The Golden Day is about a class of 11 girls and their teacher, Miss Renshaw. They are like a big family all perched up in a Sydney school from 1967. That year started off with a man getting hanged, the last man to be hanged in Australia, and PM Holt also went missing. The new teacher, Miss Renshaw, loves poetry and always takes the girls put on class excursions to the park. They would meet with Morgan, the teacher's 'boyfriend', a supposed gardener and poet, who refused to go to war. One day, they go to the park to think about death in relation to the hanging of Ronald Ryan. They meet Morgan again and he teaches them about poetry and nature. Along with Miss Renshaw, he convinces the children to go into a secret cave along the beach. On their way to the cave a naked man unexpectedly appears, staring. When they give him a second glance, he is gone. Soon enough they are in a cave with Aboriginal Dreaming paintings along the walls and ceiling of the cave and Morgan's lecture continues. He leads them deeper in and eventually it is so dark and so cramped that one of the girls gets an asthma attack. They decide to turn back without their teacher, who in turn does not protest their leaving. In the end the teacher never comes back. After an investigation is held, they find out that Morgan is actually a criminal and he is the main suspect. Eight years later Cubby, Icara, Martine and Bethany go to a cafe to celebrate the end of their tests when they meet Miss Renshaw again. But for some reason she is still the same, wearing exactly the same clothes as the day she disappeared. Cubby, unlike the others, knows that she is a ghost, or a spirit of some sort. This is because she wears exactly the same pendant that the police found, broken, on the cave floor.  Characters   Main  *Cubby: Main character; the story is told through her perspective, indirectly. She is a shy girl who is in the class of eleven. Her only real friend is Icara, who she is able to sit with yet not talk for long periods of time.

Her mother died, but Icara believes she lives in Los Angeles. She lives with her single father, who is a judge, and a 'granny', Mrs Ellerman who ended up marrying him. She is described by Miss Renshaw as reserved and a realist. *Miss Renshaw: The teacher that goes missing. She has red, springy hair and is described as tall, noble and strong. The only outfit she wore in the book was a droopy geometrical dress. She has a boyfriend called Morgan, who reportedly murdered her. She comes back after a number of years, but she still looked exactly the same as the day she disappeared. *Martine: A new student who just recently moved to Sydney from New Caledonia. She is bilingual (she can speak English and French) and has a French accent. *Morgan: He is a poet, gardener and a conscientious objector, that is, a person who refuses to fight in the war. Described in the book as having soft, beautiful eyes, poor, handsome, clever and even famous, has a voice that is low and owlish, tender, and a hippie.

It is the sequel to the 1974 film It's Alive. The film stars Frederic Forrest, Kathleen Lloyd, John P. Ryan, John Marley, Andrew Duggan and Eddie Constantine. The film was released by Warner Bros. on May 10, 1978. Plot This film continues with Frank Davis (John P. Ryan), still reeling from the death of his child and the part he played in it, seeing his chance to atone by assisting other would-be parents of mutant children. He tries to warn soon-to-be parents Jody (Kathleen Lloyd) and Eugene Scott (Frederic Forrest) of the vast and dangerous conspiracy to murder their baby and the other unborn mutant children who are being born around the country. They are convinced when they are met by Mallory (John Marley) and a strong force of police officers at the hospital as Jody is about to go into labor. She is rescued by Frank from the maternity ward before she goes into labor. The baby is delivered in a truck specially constructed for this specific purpose. They manage to elude the people going after them. The baby is placed with two others in a secluded confine for observation by the doctors Frank has been working with. Frank informs a skeptic Eugene about the special bond the babies have with their parents. Despite seemingly to adjust slightly to society, they take advantage of an opportunity to escape and begin wreaking havoc. While one of the other babies attacks Eugene in the pool, the Scott baby corners Jody with intentions unclear until Frank arrives to defuse the situation. Frank discovers a homing device placed in Jody's purse by her mother before taking the baby to safety. On his way in the woods, Frank is stopped by a night watchman, whose flashlight spooks the previously calm baby, and it attacks and kills Frank in an attempt to escape. Mallory is revealed to be the father of the monster baby born in Seattle at the end of the original, and convinces a recovering Eugene and Jody his people manage to track Jody to the place in Los Angeles where her baby is taken. The baby also finds them and Jody calms a frightened Eugene as the baby only came to be a part of the family, just as Frank Davis had previously said. However, Mallory enters with the intent to kill the baby, but it attacks him first, forcing Eugene to shoot it to save Mallory's life. In the last scene, Eugene is seen going up to expectant couples in the street to warn them and offer his help, just as Frank Davis did to him.

The film follows an ex-mercenary (Andrew Cheney) during the American Revolution who attempts to redeem himself from a life of murder by becoming a masked vigilante to overthrow the British in the colonies. The film was produced under Burns Family Studios and was released by Gathr in select theaters before a mainstream distribution by Freestyle Releasing. Beyond the Mask received negative reviews from critics, but had a warmer reception from Christian film critics. The film was later released on DVD.  Plot  The film follows William Reynolds, a former assassin for the British East India Company. He attempts to \\"retire\\" from the East India Company and as a result his Boss, Charles Kemp, tries to have him killed because he knows too much. He flees, taking the name and job of a vicar who died saving Will's life. Will attempts to settle into the quiet life of a vicar (with a surprising degree of success) and falls in love with Charlotte Holloway. An old associate happens upon the quiet town and confronts Will, who kills the man and buries him under the cover of darkness. Later, he asks Charlotte to marry him and she agrees, provided he passes her uncle's approval. At Christmas, Charlotte's uncle arrives and is revealed to be Charles Kemp, who reveals William's identity to Charlotte and tries (again) to kill him. Will flees once more, and, yet again, his rescuer dies saving Will's life. Again using the identity of his rescuer (Jeremiah Flack), William travels to the colony of Pennsylvania and finds a job in Benjamin Franklin's printing shop after passing Franklin's 'test of faith' and revealing that his sympathies lay with the revolutionary cause. Will later discovers that Charlotte and her uncle have arrived in America as well, with Kemp supporting the loyalists on behalf of the East India Company. Upon discovering Kemp's plans, Will sets out to redeem his name before reuniting with Charlotte - Working as a printer only by day, he also becomes a masked vigilante by night, thwarting the evil plans of the East India Company, and is dubbed \\"The Highwayman\\" by the revolutionaries. Will later attends a masked ball in New York with the intentions to reveal some documents he stole earlier in the film that outlines the role of the East India Company, specifically Charles Kemp. He saves the life of George Washington, but is framed and arrested by Kemp as a murderer and loses the document. He is sentenced to be hanged at dawn. While in the hole he realizes that someone else took what he deserves and he accepts the Lord into his heart truly. Realizing her feelings for William as well as her uncle's evilness, Charlotte steals her uncle's next set of plans and breaks Will out of the prison ship. They flee to Philadelphia where she is captured by her uncle's goons. Kemp reveals to her that he has planted barrels of gunpowder under various important buildings in the city, notably Independence Hall where the Continental Congress is debating the Declaration of Independence, with the explosives set to go off at noon, just when the Declaration of Independence is about to be approved. Will discovers the gunpowder and traces the trigger back through the new sewer system to Windmill Island, where Kemp and his men have set up a generator and are also holding Charlotte. After revealing the plot to Dr. Franklin, Will swims to the island, defeats Kemp's men, fights and kills Kemp, rescues Charlotte, and blows up the laboratory, preventing disaster. The Declaration of Independence is passed without incident, much to Franklin's relief. The two swim back to shore where Franklin and some soldiers are waiting for them with a prison carriage. The surviving loyalists are arrested, while Charlotte insists on accompanying Will. Out of their earshot, Franklin says that the extradition policy between Pennsylvania and New York is vague. Charlotte and Will discover a note saying that the carriage isn't taking Will to prison. Will gives Charlotte the ring he has been carrying since he first asked her to marry him back in England, she accepts, and the two kiss.  Cast  Production The idea for the movie began after cousins Aaron and Chad Burns finished their self-produced film called \\"Pendragon\\" that was picked up for international distribution and broadcast by various TV stations. Aaron said that inspiration for the latter came from novels they both read together when they were younger, and that during their homeschool education they read and analyzed the literature, biography, historical fiction, and culture that inspired their work in the film. Subsequently, they formed Burns Family Studios and started a Kickstarter campaign in 2011 to fund the costs of production, raising $24,010 of their $20,000 goal. The movie distribution company Gathr was chosen to help distribute the film for one night in selected theaters and it was later marketed by churches, social media, volunteers and homeschooling communities. Freestyle Releasing later picked it up for release in mainstream theaters; the proceeds from the films distributed alongside the movie by Freestyle, under co-writer Stephen Kendrick's team, were given back by building an 82-acre sports park in Albany and by funding missions and a new church for the communities that marketed it. Releases Burns Family Studios released Beyond the Mask on April 6, 2015 and after increasing demand and talks with movie theaters, Burns Family Studios reached an agreement with film distributor Gathr to release the films to 111 movie theaters nationwide on June 5, 2015. The film was to be released on DVD on Tuesday, September 8, 2015 in 3,900 Walmart stores across the U.S., but some didn't receive copies until a few days later due to a distribution problem. The DVD was also available on Amazon, ChristianCinema.com, and its own website (beyondthemaskmovie.com), along with a \\"making-of\\" book, soundtrack CD (which had been released substantially earlier), and other promotional merchandise. Reception Beyond The Mask received negative reviews from secular critics, but largely positive reviews from the Christian community. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 17% approval rating with an average rating of 5.1/10 based on 12 media reviewers. Christian movie review site PluggedIn gave the film four out of five \\"Plugs\\" (Units for measuring family-friendliness). The Christian media site BreatheCast gave the film four stars, saying \\"The movie's fight choreography and period costuming are to be commended. With a slim budget of $4 million, Burns Family Productions manages to create a film that visually rivals many big budget movies of the same genre (such as 'The Count of Monte Cristo' and 'Zorro'.) Variety (magazine) gave the film a largely negative review, calling it a \\"a mostly stiff, infrequently stirring attempt to furnish a swashbuckling historical yarn for Christian audiences...onscreen memories...makes a pretty odd fit with Will’s spiritual journey.\\" However, they positively reviewed the acting, calling the lead actors \\"likeable leads\\" and \\"Rhys Davies['s]...bellicose, two-dimensional villainy makes for undeniably enjoyable viewing.\\" Movieguide gave the film a largely positive review. The Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, stated that the film seemed a \\"stagy, overstuffed costume drama\\". They also called the film \\"preachy\\" and complained of a \\"cut-and-paste script by Stephen Kendrick and Paul McCusker that manages to drag into the fray Benjamin Franklin (Alan Madlane), who dutifully proceeds to offer up a medley of his greatest quotes.\\"  References   External links  Burns & Co.

Biography Watts was born in Mount Tabor (now Tabor City) a market town in Columbus County, North Carolina, United States, between 1896 and 1898. After World War One he moved to the city of Belmont, North Carolina where he worked as a weaver in textile factories. Having learned several instruments including banjo, fiddle, guitar, dobro, autoharp, harmonica, musical saw and drums he became a semi-professional musician around 1921 and made his first recordings in January or February 1927 as a duo with local guitarist Charlie Wilson (1900–?) with a single entitled \\"The Sporting Cowboy\\" which was not released at the time. With a new trio under the name of Wilmer Watts and His Lonely Eagles they recorded six sides for Paramount Records in 1927 using a line-up that included Charles Freshour (1900–1959) on guitar and the then unusual steel guitar which was played by Wilson. In 1929 he returned to Paramount's New York studios. This time Wilson was replaced on steel guitar by Palmer Rhyne (1904–1967), a fellow factory worker friend of Watts. These sessions resulted in fourteen sides. Recordings and musical style Wilmer's banjo playing was quite simple and repetitive, staying to mid-tempo songs and quite different from the more complex ragtime influenced picking of Charlie Poole or blues singer Papa Charlie Jackson or the fast choppy style of Uncle Dave Macon. Unlike most of his contemporaries Watts' musical influences seem to be based mostly on traditional Anglo-Celtic sources along with blues, ragtime, or minstrelsy and his songs have a distinctive droning modal quality compared to those of his North Carolina contemporary Charlie Poole. In his lyrical themes (at least in his recorded works) Watts largely avoided traditional folk songs and focused on more modern themes ranging from blues to a few political protest songs usually in a mocking vein similar to those of songwriter Joe Hill collected in the \\"Little Red Songbook\\" of the I.W.W.. Among Watts' best known recordings are: *\\"Been On The Job Too Long\\"; a murder ballad later covered by such artists as Lead Belly and Bob Dylan under the title of \\"Duncan and Brady\\". *\\"Walk Right In Belmont\\"; the first known recorded version of \\"The Midnight Special\\", a later standard later covered by Lead Belly, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Mac Wiseman. This single was originally released under the name \\"Watts & Wilson\\" and later through Paramount's subsidiary label Broadway Records under the name \\"Watts & Wiggins\\". *\\"Banjo Sam\\"; an especially repetitive modal song with surrealistic lyrics later covered by Grandpa Jones. *\\"Cotton Mill Blues\\"; a bluesy protest song about the plight of factory workers, based on a 1900 poem \\"A Factory Rhyme\\", later covered by Pete Seeger. *\\"Knocking Down Casey Jones\\"; a version of one of the many tribute songs then common to famous train engineer Casey Jones. This song is notably more heroic than Joe Hill's I.W.W. version. *\\"Fighting in The War With Spain\\"; an anti-war song mocking the Spanish–American War in which Watts makes light of the war and portrays himself as a deserter. *\\"The Fate Of Rhoda Sweetin\\"; A murder ballad sung and reportedly written by Charles Freshour about his own sister. This single was credited to Charles Freshour and The Lonely Eagles. *\\"She's A Hard Boiled Rose\\"; A version of a Tin Pan Alley song later used in another version by stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. *\\"Charles Guitaw\\"; A ballad (with a misspelled title) about Charles Guiteau, the assassin of President James Garfield, this song was later covered by Kelly Harrell, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Norman Blake and Ramblin Jack Elliot. Later career After the 1927 sessions Wilson left the group and was replaced by Palmer Rayne for the 1929 sessions. The Great Depression ended the recordings of many rural artists with Paramount Records going out of business in 1935 and Watts making no further recordings. He returned to Belmont where he continued working as a textile worker, tenant farmer and gas station owner as well as a part-time musician albeit without the Lonely Eagles who broke up. Watts often gigged as a one-man-band playing as many as five instruments at once. In 1931 Watts won a talent contest for his act awarded by Uncle Dave Macon. Later from the mid nineteen-thirties he formed a Southern Gospel group with his daughters as the Watts Singers who performed two regular shows on the radio but did not record. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer and retired in 1939 dying in 1944 at the age of approximately 47. His daughters continued as the Watts Singers with one of their husbands replacing Wilmer into the 1960s but did not record. Other media The only photo of Watts commonly known (showing him holding a fiddle rather than his usual banjo) was reproduced by the artist R. Crumb for a collection of trading cards of old time country musicians.

Historia cronológica de la ciudad de Buenos Aires 1536-2014, 2014. p.405, Dunken It is one of two ghost stations on the line, the other being Alberti Norte. History The station was originally opened in 1913, as one of the original Line A stations opened that year. The station was unusual for the network in the sense that it only had one platform, serving only trains heading towards Primera Junta (the terminus at the time), with the opposite platform located some metres away at Pasco station. Road workers outside the entrance to the station (1938) Given its proximity to Alberti's southern platform (located just 124 metres away), both Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte stations were closed in 1953 in order to improve the line's frequency, since the closeness of stations in that part of the line meant that trains could never accelerate to full speed before having to stop again.Los 95 años de la \\"línea A\\" - Info Almagro Some theories claim that this station was closed as a result of the destruction and burning down of the building located above the station, which was the headquarters of the Argentine Socialist Party at the time. However, it is unclear to what extent this may have influenced the closure of the station, if at all. Upon the closure of the station, passengers could still see the unaltered station for many years from the line's trains.Las estaciones clausuradas de la línea A - EnElSubte, 24 April 2014.

Urban myths There are a number of urban myths surrounding the station. The most popular of these claims that a woman depressed by being left by her boyfriend threw herself onto the tracks at the station in an act of suicide, while another version of the same myth claims that she was forced into marriage to someone she did not love by her parents and committed suicide in the same manner.

Synopsis The film Sound of Torture chronicles Meron Estafanos’ journey with the families of those who have been kidnapped, tortured, and raped by Bedouin smugglers in the Sinai Desert. Those held captive are brought to torture camps and given cell phones to call their families and beg for ransom for their release. The amount of ransom money demanded by the traffickers ranges from $15,000-$40,000 American dollars. Estefanos broadcasts her weekly radio program “Voices of Eritrean Refugees” out of her home in Stockholm, Sweden where she dedicates the show to reporting on the refugee kidnappings in Sinai. During the broadcast she reads the names of recently kidnapped victims and gives updates and advice to Eritrean listeners. The film shows Estefanos’ attempts to communicate with hostages and the kidnappers as she then airs their phone conversations during her broadcasts so the audience can bear witness the torture being inflicted. Sound of Torture follows two specific cases which takes Estafanos to Sinai where she witnesses first-hand the stories of those who have been tortured and to Tel Aviv where she finally meets the Sudanese refugees who she has kept in contact with. Production Keren Shayo chose to make this film due to the lack of media coverage and political discussion on this topic. Shayo's main goal for this film was to raise global awareness surrounding the situations Eritreans undergo when attempting to seek asylum. Shayo's previous work with migrants and refugees brought together her and Estafanos to create Sound of Torture. Background About 3,000 Eritreans a month flee the dictatorship of Isaias Afwerki and the one-party state of Eritrea where indefinite military service and forced labor is required of all Eritreans from the age of 18 to 55. Eritrea is considered one of the most surveilled countries in the world with no independent media and no public internet service. Afwerki has been the country's only president since Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopian rule in 1991. The United Nations has described the kidnappings and human trafficking in Sinai as one of the most under-reported humanitarian crises in the world while the government of Eritrea’s human rights record is considered among the worst in the world. After Europe closed its borders in 2006, the only option for Eritreans fleeing their country towards Israel is across the Sinai desert in Egypt. Critics explain that those fleeing Eritrea are looking for better opportunities in Israel away from their repressive government, conditions of poverty, and prolonged incarceration and military service. It has been reported that people of the Rashaida Tribe, Eritreans, and Sudanese soldiers are all involved in the trafficking of Eritreans to Israel. Many Eritreans pay traffickers to transport them to the Israeli border but are instead held hostage by those they paid and sold to gangs in Sinai where they are tortured and held for ransom. These strategically organized kidnapping are known as the refugee kidnappings in Sinai.

Early life  José Augusto Luis Raimundo Camprubí y Aymar was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, which was then a Spanish colony, to Raimundo Camprubí y Escudero and Isabel Aymar y Lucca de Camprubí. His father, a Catalan civil engineer, was working in Puerto Rico for the Spanish colonial government, supervising the construction of the Ponce-Coamo road. When he was still an infant, Camprubí was taken by his parents to Spain, and he grew up in Barcelona.  Education  Camprubí came to the United States in 1896 and studied at The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. He went on to Harvard, where he received an A.B. degree in 1901 and a B.S. degree in civil engineering in 1902.  Career  Camprubí’s early career followed his training in civil engineering. He represented the firm of Stone & Webster in Boston, El Paso, Texas, and Terre Haute, Indiana before joining the Public Service Corporation in Newark, New Jersey. He was subsequently employed by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad during the construction of the Hudson Tubes, the railway tunnels beneath the Hudson River linking Manhattan and northern New Jersey. In 1912 to 1914, he represented General Electric in Buenos Aires. At the end of World War I, he approached a friend from both Hotchkiss and Harvard, Ernest Gruening, who had been a journalist prior to his brief service in the United States Army. Camprubí explained that he \\"was in the market for a Spanish-language newspaper, which he hoped would promote better relations between the United States and Latin America while also improving the cultural image of New York City’s Hispanics.\\" In light of Gruening’s background in journalism, Camprubí asked whether he thought that the plan was feasible. Gruening suggested purchasing La Prensa, a struggling Spanish-language weekly that was based in New York City. Camprubí pursued the idea of buying the newspaper and converting it into a daily, and he asked Gruening to serve as editor. Despite the fact that he spoke no Spanish, Gruening had no other attractive offers and agreed. Gruening remained with the newspaper for over a year, dealing primarily with the business aspects of running a newspaper. (Gruening entered politics shortly thereafter and later became one of the first two U.S. Senators for Alaska.) Camprubí ran La Prensa for the remainder of his life and became a prominent spokesman both for the improvement of relations between the United States and for the welfare of Spanish-speaking Americans. He set La Prensa's policy as one of stressing \\"democracy and cooperation between the nations of North and South America.\\" By the time Cambrubí greeted Federico García Lorca, the Spanish playwright, at the docks of New York in 1929, La Prensa was \\"New York’s most important Spanish-language daily\\" and \\"the newspaper of record of the city’s burgeoning Spanish-speaking community.\\" Following Cambrubí’s death from a heart ailment in 1942, his wife and daughters took control of the company and turned it into the first US daily newspaper run by women. The family sold the newspaper in 1957, and it merged with El Diario de Nueva York in 1963 to become El Diario La Prensa.  Personal life  On February 18, 1909, Camprubí married Agnes Ethel Leaycraft (daughter of Charles Russell Leaycraft and Mary Leontine Roosevelt); she was a third cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt. The couple had two daughters: Inés (born in 1911) and Leontine (born in 1915). Caprubí’s sister, Zenobia Camprubí, was a writer and poet as well as the wife of Spanish poet and Nobel laureate Juan Ramón Jiménez.

Plant deaths  Captain Plant, his wife, Alice, and their two adopted Chinese daughters, boarded SS Teiresias in Shanghai for travel to England on February 23, 1921. After only three days at sea, Captain Plant, who had been ailing, died in his cabin from pneumonia, despite ship doctor's efforts to treat his condition. Alice, who was struggling too, died three days later, from heart failure when the ship arrived at its first stop in Hong Kong. Both Plants were interred at the Hong Kong Cemetery in Happy Valley. Rt. Rev. William Banister conducted the graveside service. The Plants' two adopted Chinese daughters were among the chief mourners.Polly Shih Brandmeyer, \\"Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives: Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch, Vol. 54 (2014), p. 101.  Plant Memorial Fund  In a letter to the North-China Herald, dated two weeks after the Plants’ deaths, British Consul John Langford Smith of Yichang proposed the creation of a Memorial Fund to Captain Plant. He outlined three goals: 1) to build a monument to perpetuate Plant’s memory and service, 2) to install a drinking fountain for trackers and 3), to provide for the Plants’ two Chinese daughters. On March 6, 1922, a pamphlet was printed and issued in English and Chinese outlining the Plant Memorial Fund objectives and the formation of a Plant Memorial Committee, with representatives from Great Britain, America, China, Japan and France. Donations were collected from individuals, ship crews, and shipping firms. Though the Fund was successful in constructing the memorial and providing for Plant's adopted Chinese daughters,\\"A Memorial to Captain Plant,\\" The North-China Herald, 2 April 1921, p. 33. there is no evidence the Fund met its objective of installing a drinking fountain.  Monument inscription  On October 4, 1923, the Plant monument, designed by Lawrence Tweedie-Stodart, was erected in Xintan at the site of Captain Plant’s former bungalow. The obelisk was inscribed both in English and in Chinese. Two of the four sides of the monument faced the Yangtze River diagonally. The English wording faced East because Captain Plant came from the sea and could be seen traveling upriver from the coast. The Chinese wording faced West because the Chinese came from the interior and could be seen traveling downriver Sichuan.Plant Memorial Fund Brochure, 20th March 1923, MS/69/123, Papers of Capt.

There is some debate about the origins of the Plant Memorial defacement. Some say the National Red Guards in the 1960s came in an act of xenophobia to tear down what they considered to be an honor to a foreigner. The solid granite obelisk proved difficult to raze entirely and the Red Guard expressed their sentiments by chiseling out every character and letter in the inscriptions.Simon WInchester, The River at the Center of the World, New York: Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1996, p.265.A.

Others have reported the defacement came during the Land Reform Movement in the 1950s.Wang Jian-xiang, Qu-Yuan Literary Magazine, Summer 2008. In either case, Xintan, a Chinese community of river pilots and junk owners, had been protective of the memorial and of Plant’s contributions to them and the Yangtze. During his retirement, Plant lived among the residents of Xintan, outside of the treaty ports and away from the foreign settlements and his fellow expatriates.Brandmeyer, Op. Cit. The local people of Xintan remained loyal to Plant and in 2002, before the monument would be fully submerged in water from the Three Gorges Dam, they moved the memorial, 114 blocks, weighing 171 tons, to higher ground.Inscription on the monument.

Early career Ogden graduated the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York in 1977 with honors. He was the recipient of the Richard T. Keating Award, given to the student most likely succeed. In 1979, Ogden was hired as a sous chef at the celebrated American Restaurant in Kansas City. He worked closely with his friend and mentor James Beard and his consultants Joe Baun and Barbara Kafka. Ogden was promoted to executive chef within six months. Chef Ogden says the greatest influence on his cooking came from his early exposure to fresh Native American foods. Born in Traverse City, he grew up eating freshly caught trout, free-range chicken and hand-picked fruits and vegetables. That early exposure followed him throughout his culinary training and while he was exposed to new techniques and ingredients, he never lost his deep appreciation for those basic tastes. Career In 1983, Ogden became the executive chef at the Campton Place hotel and transformed it to a destination dining spot. After six years he opened the Lark Creek Inn, a signature restaurant in Larkspur with his then-wife Jody Ogden and his business partners Michael and Leslye Dellar. There are currently 14 restaurants which the Lark Creek Restaurant Group encompasses. This restaurant had been acclaimed by leading critics and publications as one of the best restaurants in the nation. In 2003, Ogden moved to Las Vegas and opened his restaurant in Caesars Palace with his son Bryan, who is also a chef. This was Ogden's first restaurant opened outside of California. Both restaurants has since closed. He has appeared on such television programs as the Today Show, Good Morning, America, AM/San Francisco, Dinner at Julia's and Great Chefs of the West series on the Discovery Channel. In 2012, Ogden launched Bradley Ogden Hospitality, a four-pronged business venture seeking to encompass restaurants, consulting, social media and even a boutique resort community. Ogden started Bradley Ogden Hospitality with his son Bryan Ogden and operations specialist Tony Angotti. Bradley Ogden Hospitality (BOH) is composed of three divisions: Restaurant Development, Consulting and Design, and Digital. Today, Chef Bradley Ogden serves as managing partner of Bradley Ogden Hospitality which he founded with his son, Chef Bryan Ogden. The group consists of multiple areas of focus including media, restaurant development, new products and more. Ogden Hospitality opened four restaurants in 2015 including The Pour Society and Bradley’s Fine Diner in Houston, Texas as well as Bradley's Fine Diner and Bradley’s Funky Franks in Menlo Park, California.

The British succeeded in capturing the entire convoy, with minimal casualties to themselves. Nelson had received the news that the French were trying to take supplies to St Pierre d'Acena for the siege of Mantua. He therefore set out to intercept any such attempt. When Nelson and his squadron sighted a small convoy of seven sail skirting the coast, he pursued them. The French vessels anchored under the guns of a shore battery and hoisted French flags. Nelson then sent in the squadron's ships' boats to capture the convoy. After a short resistance by an armed tartane of three guns, a gunboat of one gun, and the battery, the British succeeded in taking the vessels. British casualties were one man killed and three wounded. French records place the action off Arma di Taggia and Bussana.Fonds Marine, p.184.

Génie, however, was apparently purchased, at Agde, and commissioned in June 1796. The French Navy armed the tartanes with large guns to serve as gunboats. *Numéro Douze (Chaloupe-cannonière №12), was a gunboat of one 18-pounder gun, four swivel guns, and 30 men.

They released, Words Can't Express, in 1983 with Message Records, which would be their last album released by them, and this was their Billboard magazine breakthrough release upon the Gospel Albums chart. Their other albums were released by Command Records, starting in 1985, with the release of Dedicated, and this charted #1 on the aforementioned chart. The duo released nine more albums with four of those placing upon the Gospel Albums chart, 1987's A Love Like This, 1989's Live in Memphis, 1990's More than Music, and 1992's Back to Basics. Their last album release happened in 1994 with Fired Up! Background The origins of the duo date back to Philip Nicholas' father who was a repentant Jazz musician, and he became a minister of music around his hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in high school, Philip acquired the ability to play the piano, which he utilized in his family band, The Nicholas Chorale Ensemble, that counted as its members Philip's brother, Lonnie, nephews, Steve and Ira Jackson, and a number of other friends and family members on a revolving basis. Philip went to college in his hometown at Drexel University. He was very close friends with a young lady named Diane. She united Philip with a dorm-mate of hers, Brenda Watson, because Brenda was a loud, early morning, shower songstress in the dormitory bathroom. Diane felt that bringing Brenda to Philip's singing group would give her dormitory floor well earned relief from Brenda's early morning shower concerts. Brenda and Philip would soon hit it off both in their professional and personal lives, marrying on February 18, 1978, that just happened to be on Philip's 24th birthday. After completing college and marrying in New Jersey, the duo settled in Los Angeles, California where they became musical ministers at the renowned pastor,Time Magazine 12-31-79 Dr. E.V. Hill's church. In pursuit of their professional music career, they coined the group name, Nicholas. They tried and failed to release albums with Motown Records, so Philip alongside partner and brother, Lonnie Nicholas, they established their own record label, Message Records in 1981. At this time the group was a quartet, with another female (Linda Laury Harold) and nephew (Steve Jackson) as the main vocalist. This brotherly owned label would soon cease, when Philip and Lonnie differed over the labels direction, causing Philip to depart, and creating Command Records with ex- Motown producer, Kent Washburn. History The duo, but quartet at the time, released albums in 1981 entitled Tell the World, Words Can't Express in 1983, in 1985 the album Dedicated, and a 12 inch single Tell Somebody/God's Woman in 1985. Two of these albums charted, Word's Can't Express and Dedicated, and they placed at Nos. 10 and 1 respectively on the Billboard magazine Gospel Albums chart. The remaining albums released by the husband and wife duo with Command Records were, 1987's A Love Like This, 1988's Live in Memphis, Contemporary, and Inspirational, 1990's More than Music, 1991's Back to Basics, 1993's The Inspirational Sounds Of Nicholas Vol. 1, and lastly, 1994's Fired Up! Four of these albums charted on the aforementioned chart, A Live Like This at No. 2, Live in Memphis at No. 10, More than Music at No. 14, and Back to Basics at No. 12. Members * Philip W.

History   (1980–84)  The band was formed in late 1980 by Guitarist Mark Tighe and Vocalist Ian Tilleard. After starting life as Heaven Seventeen, and with early line-ups including a pre-Zodiac Mindwarp Mark Manning, the band eventually settled as 1919 (after a book belonging to Tighe) with Nick Hiles on Bass and Mick Reed on Drums. Their intention was, according to Reed, \\"to create a heavy melodic intense dance band with no frills and no intentions\\". In 1982, 1919 released a 7\\" white label promo of Repulsion//Tear Down These Walls, and were subsequently invited to record their first session with John Peel in May that year. 1982 would see the single re-released on Red Rhino Records, as well as the single Caged//After The Fall and the LP Machine. In 1983, Bassist Hiles was replaced by Steve Madden, and the band recorded their second and final Peel session on 4 May. Madden featured on the final recordings of this era, a 7\\" and 12\\" version of Cry Wolf//Storm and Cry Wolf//Dream//Storm respectively, which were released on Abstract Records along with the 12\\" Earth Song EP, released in 1984 after the band's dissolution. During this period, 1919 had also included Kev Aston (Saxophone) and Sputnik (Paul Drake) (Synthesizer) at various times as part of their ensemble.  The Hive / Another Cinema (1984–85)  By the release of Earth Song in 1984, the band had split into two splinter projects, with Reed continuing as 1919 AD before reuniting with Drake to form The Hive. The others became Another Cinema, with the line-up of Tighe, Tilleard, Madden, and Stefan Khacheturian on drums. Another Cinema were once again taken under the wing of Red Rhino founder Tony Kostrzewa, this time releasing their singles I Had a Bad Dream Last Night (1984), Hallucination Spires (1984), and Midnight Blue Oceans under the Altered States banner. The Hive released a cassette album, Stream of Consciousness, on Sicky Spread Tapes, and the 12\\" EP, Kingdom Rise Kingdom Fall, on Hum Music. Both bands had disbanded by 1986.  Comeback / The Madness Continues (2014–2016)  Thanks largely to the emergence of streaming sites, the early work of the band continued to generate interest among fans. In 2014, Tighe started working on new material with bass player and vocalist Rio Goldhammer. Their self-released download of Revenge, and accompanying video, (by Chalkman Video, http://www.chalkmanvideo.com also see \\"Death Note & Bloodline videos), came as a surprise to most fans but was received well. Mick Mercer again rated the track highly, and the band signed almost immediately with Deadfall Management. The band performed their first show, headlining Leipzig's Gothic Pogo Festival on Friday 22 May, and began to announce further dates across Europe. On 30 August 2015 it was announced that Reed had returned to the band as their permanent drummer and that, with the addition of Karl Donner on bass, 1919 would once again be a 4-piece, with Goldhammer remaining on vocals. Shortly afterwards, the band released a live session on CD, titled 2015: \\"The Madness Continues\\" Sessions, containing songs from their early years alongside four new tracks, which would become the self-released Death Note EP.  Bloodline LP and death of Tighe (2017–present)  In July 2016, 1919 released a promo video for Bloodline, which was to be the title track for their second studio album. The band had signed a deal with Westworld Recordings to release the album but, with a release date not yet set, ventured once again into Europe to promote the single. After the first leg of the tour, the band were forced to cancel most of the remaining shows as Tighe had been diagnosed with cancer on his return home. The band played a final show at Brighton Racecourse's Undercover Festival, with Mark's dramatic weight loss making it impossible to travel for extended periods. This would prove to be his final performance. On 28 January 2017, 1919 announced the tragic news of the passing of their iconic guitarist, aged 56, after his short battle with the cancer. The coming days saw tributes pour in from around the world as the news broke throughout the music press, led by John Robb at Louder Than War, and the band published an obituary in four languages on their homepage. With Tighe insistent the band continue indefinitely in his absence, an album- release show was still scheduled for the following week in Leeds. At the last minute, and after careful deliberation despite the insistence from Tighe in his final days, the remaining band decided to press ahead with a memorial performance, with money collected for Marie Curie in Tighe's honour. Bloodline was released on 3 March and was received well by critics, with Vive le Rock's Pete Woods writing \\"Good goths come to those that wait\\" in an 8/10 review. In April the band confirmed that Sam Evans would be their new full-time guitarist, and began touring the new album once again to good reviews. As of October, the band played the last of 19 dates across Europe in Leeds.

Piano burning is the act of setting on fire an acoustic piano, most commonly an upright, as either a ceremony or a form of performance art. Although piano burning ceremonies are now popular in the Royal Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force and the United States Air Force, there is little or no evidence to suggest that descriptions of its origin have any historical authenticity. According to one version of its origin, pianos were set alight by RAF pilots to avoid piano lessons aimed at improving their dexterity and general level of culture. Another version is that piano burning began in World War II in remembrance of fallen RAF pilots. Several contemporary musicians, including Annea Lockwood, Yōsuke Yamashita, and Diego Stocco, have composed for and performed on pianos which have been deliberately set alight. A burning piano was also the centrepiece of Douglas Gordon's 2012 video installation, The End of Civilisation.  Ceremonial piano burning  In The Phantom in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Cold War Warrior, David Gledhill recounts a combat training exercise in Germany during the Cold War where Jaguar pilots from RAF Wildenrath and RAF Bruggen had the task of destroying a piano placed on Nordhorn Ridge with a single practice bomb. Because the target was so small, it was only the last Jaguar on the last flight of the exercise that finally managed to hit it. The pilots from both bases celebrated that evening at RAF Wildenrath by burning a second piano in the Officers' Mess.David Gledhill, David (2014). The Phantom in Focus: A Navigator's Eye on Britain's Cold War Warrior , p. 132. Fonthill Media. Although piano burning has become popular with air forces and especially the Royal Air Force since World War II, its origin is undocumented and has been the subject of myth and decades of storytelling. One of the most common legends traces its origin to the British Royal Air Force sometime between World War I and II when so many pilots died during World War I that the RAF was forced to select its pilots from the common population, instead of their usual preference for upper-class families. Attempts were made to educate the pilots on refined manners and tastes, but these lessons became very unpopular among the pilots, especially the piano lessons which the Royal Air Force believed would increase the pilots' level of culture and improve their dexterity. According to this story, the burning began at RAF Leuchars, where the only piano at the base burned down accidentally and piano lessons were cancelled. Word spread, and soon pilots at more and more Royal Air Force bases began to burn the pianos to avoid lessons.Crowell, Lt. Col. Miles (26 August 2005). \\"Why Pilots Torch Pianos at Club\\" . Vance Air Force Base News. Retrieved 22 April 2015. Another legendary version of the tradition's origin holds that RAF piano burning began as a tribute to fallen airmen. According to the New Zealand Herald, a piano-playing pilot in the Royal Air Force during World War II played to his fellow airmen each time one of their number had been killed. When he himself was killed in action, his comrades decided that \\"if he couldn't play the piano any more, nobody would, so they dragged it outside and set it alight.\\"Eriksen, Alanah (30 April 2010). \\"PM visits survivor of Iroquois tragedy\\" .

Compositions for burning pianos  Annea Lockwood In 1968, New Zealand composer Annea Lockwood wrote a piece called Piano Burning.Annea Lockwood, \\"Piano Burning and Tiger Balm,\\" Source no.9 (1971), p. 48. The written description includes a photograph of Lockwood executing the work. A recording of the work (\\"Source Record Number Six\\") came with that issue of the periodical. The score specifies that the performer uses an upright piano that is beyond repair. In the composer's words, > Piano burning should really be done with an upright piano; the structure is > much more beautiful than that of a grand when you watch it burn. The piano > must always be one that’s irretrievable, that nobody could work on, that no > tuner or rebuilder could possibly bring back.

Dressed in a protective firefighter's uniform, Yamashita improvised on the burning piano during sunset on a beach in western Japan.

Diego Stocco Diego Stocco composed a piece called The Burning Piano, which is made up entirely of his recordings of a burning piano. Stocco began the burning process by pointing a butane lighter directly towards the strings and played single notes, and after the flame was extinguished he played with what remained.Rosenthal, Emerson (3 October 2011). \\"Diego Stocco Can Make Music Out of Anything, Including A Burning Piano .

The virtual instrument company Spectrasonics created a sample library called Omnisphere which includes a Burning Piano sample recorded by Stocco. Michael Hannan Michael Hannan's compositions have often involved pieces for pianos which have been altered in some way, including being set on fire. His 2003 Burning Questions, a radiophonic work commissioned by ABC Radio National, explored the \\"cultural politics of auto-destructive music\\" and included the sounds of a burning baby grand piano (with a microphone placed inside), the observers' reactions, and Hannan playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata on the piano immediately prior to setting it alight. According to Hannan: > The act of burning a piano [...] stimulates a strong emotional response from > an audience. I became more interested in the crowd's response than in the > sounds made from the piano itself. The piano burning which forms the basis of the work had taken place on 2 October 1999 at Bellingen, New South Wales.

The burning for Piano Flamboyant took place on the roof of Arman's atelier in Nice and was filmed for a documentary by Gérard Patris which was later broadcast on French national television. As with his other burnt instrument works, which also included violins, cellos, and guitars, the charred remains were then mounted on panels or enclosed in plexiglas. One of Arman's earliest works of piano destruction was his 1962 Chopin's Waterloo which took at the Galerie Saqqârah in Gstaad.

Born in Barcelona, Spain she held Guatemalan citizenship and lived in exile in Mexico. She worked as a professor in both Guatemala and Mexico. Much of her poetry was published in Mexico and she co- founded one of the first feminist publications, Fem, in the country. After her husband's death, she made a trip to Guatemala to see her mother and renew her passport. She was detained and disappeared in Guatemala City on 19 December 1980, presumed to be murdered. Some sources note the date of her disappearance as 9 December 1980.Foppa, A., & Franco, J. (1981). [Alaide Foppa de Solórzano]. Signs, 7(1), 4-4. Biography María Alaíde Foppa Falla was born 3 December 1914 in Barcelona, Spain to Tito Livio Foppa and Julia Falla. Her mother was a pianist of Guatemalan descent and her father was an Argentine- Italian diplomat. She grew up traveling, living in Belgium, France and Italy. She was educated in Italy, studying the history of art and literature. She spoke fluent Italian and worked for several years as a translator. In the 1940s, Foppa attained Guatemalan citizenship, and married a Guatemalan leftist, Alfonso Solórzano. A member of the FDN, he was an \\"intellectual communist\\", who managed the Guatemala Institute of Social Security. Solórzano eventually also served as a cabinet adviser to Guatemalan president Jacobo Árbenz With Solórzano, she had four children, born in Mexico: Mario, Juan Pablo, Silvia and Laura. Foppa's oldest son Julio was the child of Juan José Arévalo, Árbenz's predecessor as president of Guatemala. Foppa served on the faculty of the humanities department at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (University of San Carlos of Guatemala) and was a founder of the Italian Institute of Culture in the Central American country. She and her husband were forced to flee the country in 1954 when the presidency of Jacobo Árbenz was overthrown by a CIA-backed military coup. Foppa lived in exile in Mexico, working as a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where she taught Italian at the School of Philosophy and Letters and offered the first-ever course at a Latin American university on the sociology of women. She lectured at other institutions, published columns and served as an art critic in local newspapers, and she wrote much of her poetry in Mexico City. It is believed that other than a volume called Poesías printed in Madrid and La Sin Ventura published in Guatemala, all her other poetic works were published in Mexico, though she wrote and edited some of them at her family's farm in the Sacatepéquez Department, while visiting her mother. In 1972, she created the radio program \\"Foro de la Mujer\\" (Women's Forum) which was broadcast on Radio Universidad, to discuss inequalities within Mexican society, violence and how violence should be treated as a public rather than a private concern, and to explore women's lives. In 1975, she co-founded with Margarita García Flores the publication Fem, a magazine for scholarly analysis of issues from a feminist perspective. Foppa financed the publication from her own funds. Important Mexican journalists and intellectuals aided in the co- founding of the magazine.Mariscal, Sonia.

Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7c7114jz Many prominent Latin Americans in the early 1980s did not identify with \\"Feminism\\" but rather with \\"Humanism\\", as in the case of Griselda Alvarez when asked by Fem. Foppa was also a regular participant in events with Amnesty International and the International Association of Women Against Repression (AIMUR). With others of the Guatemalan intellectual community, Foppa denounced the government for human rights violations and her name began appearing on published lists of \\"subversives\\". Disappearance When her husband Solórzano was struck and killed by a car, Foppa went to Guatemala, ostensibly to visit her mother and renew her passport, but it was believed she had decided to work for the guerrillas. By one account, she had engaged in a guerrilla courier mission to Guatemala City, where she was promptly captured by government security forces. Both of her sons Mario and Juan Pablo, though born in Mexico, had returned to fight with the guerrilla forces in Guatemala and were killed. Her daughter, Silvia, who also supported the rebels, had been in hiding in Cuba for a while and at the time of Foppa's disappearance was back in Guatemala. Foppa's daughter Laura was a dancer and was performing in a production at the Covarrubias Theatre that was to open on 21 December 1980. When she called to verify that her mother would be returning for the performance, she learned from her grandmother of her mother's disappearance with the chauffeur, Leocadio Axtún Chiroy. Oldest son, Julio Solórzano Foppa, got a phone call from Laura who imparted the news to him and oldest daughter, Silvia learned of her mother's disappearance on the radio in a guerrilla camp in the mountains of El Quiché. Foppa had apparently gone to buy flowers and pick up her passport in Guatemala City on 19 December 1980. She was accompanied by her mother's driver, Leocadio Axtún, who had taken her to the Plaza El Amate, where they were intercepted, and never heard from again. Rumors were that she was tortured by a death squad of a high-ranking minister and killed the same day she was captured. Initially the newspapers carried a report that she had been abducted by members of the G-2 intelligence unit, beaten, and forced into a car, which sped away, but fearful of retaliation witnesses would not come forward. When news of the disappearance reached friends and family, they mobilized. Daughter Laura, who had won a grant to study dance in New York, used the trip to visit both the United Nations and the office of human rights of the Organization of American States. Julio, flew to Paris and with the help of friends secured an audience with the Legislative Assembly in an attempt to put international pressure on the Guatemalan government. Friends wrote letters and formed committees to demand action from the Guatemalan authorities. Julio returned to Mexico and met with Jorge Castañeda y Álvarez de la Rosa, Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Mexican president Jose Lopez Portillo authorized a commission of legal scholars, journalists and Foppa's children to go to investigate the disappearance; however, right before the group was to leave, a veiled threat was received telling them they were welcome to come but that \\"international communism, in its efforts to make the Guatemalan government look bad, may cause harm… to come to them.\\" The group decided the risk was too great, since Foppa was probably not still alive. On 2 December 1999, Foppa's children requested that the Audiencia Nacional de España open an inquiry. Though a case was opened, Guatemalan authorities did not respond. In 2005, an explosion at an obscure police station on the outskirts of Guatemala City revealed an archive of records going back to the creation in 1880 of the National Police. Forensic teams began examining the documents in the Guatemala National Police Archives, and Julio Solórzano wanted to ensure that the documents remained accessible. He contacted Karen Engle at the University of Texas’ Rapoport Center for Human Rights and persuaded them to digitize the records. He is hopeful that within the archive is information on his mother's case. In 2010, Foppa's family, Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM) (Mutual Support Group) and the Centro de Reportes Informativos sobre Guatemala (CERIGUA) (Center of Informative Reports on Guatemala) and other organizations demanded that an inquiry into Foppa's disappearance be launched by Guatemalan authorities.Dore, A., Asher, A., Bernikow, L., Chevigny, B., & Christ, R. et al.

Retrieved September 29, 2017, from http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1981/12/17/missing-person/ In 2012, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) filed a complaint against Guatemala's inaction on the case. In 2014, Foppa's daughter Silvia concurred that there was no resolution from any of the court actions—in Spain, before the Guatemalan Supreme Court, or from the IACHR case. The whereabouts of Foppa and what happened to her is still unanswered. In 2014, a documentary by Maricarmen de Lara entitled “¡Alaíde Foppa, la sin ventura!” (Alaide Foppa, without luck) was released. Foppa, A., & Franco, J. (1981). [Alaide Foppa de Solórzano].

It was created by American programmer Terry A. Davis, who developed it alone over the course of a decade after a series of prophetic episodes that he later described as a revelation from God. The system was characterized as a modern x86-64 Commodore 64, using an interface similar to a mixture of DOS and Turbo C. Davis proclaimed that the system's features, such as its 640x480 resolution, 16-color display and single audio voice, were designed according to explicit instructions from God. It was programmed with an original variation of C (named HolyC) in place of BASIC, and included an original flight simulator, compiler and kernel. TempleOS was released as J Operating System in 2005, as TempleOS in 2013, and was last updated in 2017. It was received with largely favorable reviews in tech communities and Davis amassed a small online following. Background Terry A. Davis Terry A. Davis (1969–2018) began experiencing regular manic episodes in 1996, leading him to numerous stays at mental hospitals. Initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was later declared schizophrenic and remained unemployed for the rest of his life. He suffered from delusions of space aliens and government agents that left him briefly hospitalized for his mental health issues. After experiencing a self-described \\"revelation\\", he proclaimed that he was in direct communication with God, and that God told him the operating system was for God's third temple. Davis began developing TempleOS circa 2003. One of its early names was the \\"J Operating System\\" before renaming it to \\"LoseThos\\", a reference to a scene from the 1986 film Platoon. In 2008, Davis wrote that LoseThos was \\"primarily for making video games. \\"It has no networking or Internet support. As far as I'm concerned, that would be reinventing the wheel\\". Another name he used was \\"SparrowOS\\" before settling on \\"TempleOS\\". In mid-2013, his website announced: \\"God's temple is finished. Now, God kills CIA until it spreads .\\" Davis died after being hit by a train on August 11, 2018. System overview TempleOS is a 64-bit, non-preemptive multi-tasking, multi- cored, public domain, open source, ring-0-only, single address space, non- networked, PC operating system for recreational programming. The OS runs 8-bit ASCII with graphics in source code and has a 2D and 3D graphics library, which run at 640x480 VGA with 16 colors. Like most modern operating systems, it has keyboard and mouse support. It supports ISO 9660, FAT32 and RedSea file systems (the latter created by Davis) with support for file compression. According to Davis, many of these specifications—such as the 640x480 resolution, 16-color display and single audio voice—were instructed to him by God. He explained that the limited resolution was to make it easier for children to draw illustrations for God. The operating system includes an original flight simulator, compiler, and kernel. One bundled program, \\"After Egypt\\", is a game in which the player travels to a burning bush to use a \\"high-speed stopwatch\\". The stopwatch is meant to act as an oracle that generates pseudo-random text, something Davis likened to a Ouija board and glossolalia. An example of generated text follows: TempleOS was written in a programming language developed by Davis as a middle ground between C and C++, originally called \\"C+\\" (C Plus), later renamed to \\"HolyC\\". It doubles as the shell language, enabling the writing and execution of entire applications from within the shell. The IDE that comes with TempleOS supports several features, such as embedding images in code. It uses a non-standard text format (known as DolDoc) which has support for hypertext links, images, and 3D meshes to be embedded into what are otherwise standard ASCII files. A file can have a spinning 3D model of a tank as a comment in source code. Most code in the OS is JIT-compiled, and it is generally encouraged to use JIT compilation as opposed to creating binaries. Davis ultimately wrote over 100,000 lines of code for the OS. Critical reception TempleOS received mostly favorable reviews. Tech journalist David Cassel opined that this was partly because \\"programming websites tried to find the necessary patience and understanding to accommodate Davis\\". TechRepublic and OSNews published positive articles on Davis' work, even though Davis was banned from the latter for hostile comments targeting its readers and staff. In his review for TechRepublic, James Sanders concluded that \\"TempleOS is a testament to the dedication and passion of one man displaying his technological prowess. It doesn't need to be anything more.\\" OSNews editor Kroc Camen wrote that the OS \\"shows that computing can still be a hobby; why is everybody so serious these days? If I want to code an OS that uses interpretive dance as the input method, I should be allowed to do so, companies like Apple be damned.\\" In 2017, the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourogne, France. After Davis' death, OSNews editor Thom Holwerda wrote: \\"Davis was clearly a gifted programmer – writing an entire operating system is no small feat – and it was sad to see him affected by his mental illness\\". One fan described Davis as a \\"programming legend\\", while another, a computer engineer, compared the development of TempleOS to a one-man-built skyscraper. The engineer had previously spoken to Davis at length and believed that Davis could have been a \\"Steve Jobs\\" or a \\"Steve Wozniak\\" were it not for his illness. He added that it \\"actually boggles my mind that one man wrote all that\\" and that it was \\"hard for a lay person to understand what a phenomenal achievement\\" it is to write an entire operating system alone.

On the other hand, Bhutan's GNH Index is a local development framework and measurement index, published by the Centre for Bhutan Studies in 2012 based on 2011 Index function designed by Alkire-Foster at Oxford University. The Bhutan's GNH Index is customized to the country's Buddhist cultural and spiritual values, it tracks 9 subjective happiness areas including spiritual measurement such as prayers recitation and other Karma indicators. The concepts and issues at the heart of Bhutanese approach are similar to the secular GNH Index. In 2006, a policy white paper providing recommendations for implementing the GNW Index metric was published by the International Institute of Management. The paper is widely referenced by academic and policy maker citing the GNW / GNH index as a potential model for local socioeconomic development and measurement.\\"Happiness Economics - GNH Index Research Citations\\" GNW survey components The subjective survey part of the GNW measurement system is structured into seven areas or dimensions.\\"The Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey - Global GNH Index Survey\\" Each area or dimension satisfaction rating is scaled from 0–10: 0 being very dissatisfied, 5 being neutral, and 10 is very satisfied. #Mental & Emotional Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10): Frequency and levels of positive vs. negative thoughts and feelings over the past year #Physical & Health Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10): Physical safety and health, including risk to life, body and property and the cost and quality of healthcare, if one gets sick #Work & Income Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10): Job and income to support essential living expenses, including shelter, food, transportation, and education.

Lyon. The film examines American race relations through the analysis of two events, both of which took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma: the 1921 Tulsa race riot and the 2012 \\"Good Friday Murders.\\" Background Filmmakers Rachel Lyon and Bavand Karim wrote and developed the project after learning of the \\"Good Friday Murders\\" in Tulsa. As part of the scholarship on race relations connected to the film, Lyon co-authored the paper \\"Digital Divisions: Racial Injustice and the Limits of Social Informatics in The State of Georgia vs. Troy Anthony Davis,\\" which was presented at the Northern Kentucky Law Review Symposium in 2012. Initial funding for the film was raised through a Kickstarter campaign. Lyon and Karim traveled to Tulsa and Chicago to conduct interviews, and footage of the race riot survivors was acquired from the film Before They Die! Production was completed in December 2013. Synopsis The film examines the underlying racial tensions in Tulsa, Oklahoma, through two central events, the 1921 race riots and the 2012 \\"Good Friday Murders.\\" Through interviews with a variety of scholars and public figures, the documentary explores the roots of American racial animosity, presenting Tulsa as a microcosm of the American social, cultural, and racial landscape, and scrutinizing the role of the media in controlling information, and influencing public response and the justice system. Interviews People interviewed in Hate Crimes in the Heartland include: *Rev. Jesse Jackson, Civil Rights Activist and Founder, Rainbow/PUSH *Charles Ogletree, Jesse Climenko Professor of Law at Harvard Law School *Andrea Lyon, Dean and Professor of Law at Valparaiso University Law School *Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr., Mayor of Tulsa *Tim Harris, Tulsa District Attorney *Chuck Jordan, Chief of Police, Tulsa Police Department Screenings In January 2014, Lioness Media Arts announced a partnership with The Ford Foundation, Amnesty International, and the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard University for a series of national screenings and discussion forums. Hate Crimes in the Heartland premiered nationally in seven cities during a Black History Month tour in February 2014, with screenings held in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, and on the campuses of Florida Atlantic University and DePaul. The film has also been featured at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the University of Oklahoma, Harvard University, and the New School. Response Following the film's release, JustFilms Director Cara Mertes of the Ford Foundation stated, \\"Hate Crimes in the Heartland revisits powerful moments in American history — past and present — that remind us of the profound racial tensions that have shaped the country's trajectory.\\" Amnesty International praised the film's message of reconciliation. \\"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. asserted that civil rights are human rights, and that is the message that we take away from this film,\\" said Steven W. Hawkins, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. \\"Given the historical racial tensions of the last century and the ongoing racial violence of today, we must work to build a culture that values and believes in human rights if we hope to overcome these problems.\\" David Harris, Managing Director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice, emphasized the film's potential for public education. \\"Through the personal accounts of survivors, witnesses, journalists, and lawmakers, Hate Crimes in the Heartland enriches the public understanding of the underlying tension in America's heartland, exposing injustices that occurred and giving a voice to those whose perspectives would otherwise remain unheard,\\" Harris said. According to Harvard Professor Charles Ogletree, \\"Heartland gives an honest accounting of the 1921 Tulsa race riot, revealing Tulsa's story in the context of racial disparity happening in every city in America today as well.\\" Awards Hate Crimes in the Heartland received the Paul Robeson Award for Best Feature Documentary at the 2014 Newark Black Film Festival. Release The documentary is available through Alexander Street Press. In November 2015, it was acquired by Virgil Films & Entertainment. The film premiered on Netflix on Feb. 1, 2016.

It was the last of five forts: Keogh (1876), Custer (1877), Missoula (1877), Assinniboine (1879), and Maginnis (1880) - built following the defeat of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer by Native Americans at the Battle of Little Bighorn in June, 1876. History Fort Maginnis was established in 1880, 4 1/2 miles east of Maiden, Montana Territory, (now a ghost town) by companies of the 3rd Infantry Regiment (United States) under the command of Captain Daingerfield Parker. The fort was named for Martin Maginnis, Major of the 11th Minnesota Infantry during the Civil War, and the then U.S. Representative from Montana Territory's At-large district. Elements of the 1st United States Cavalry Regiment garrisoned the post beginning in 1881. Maginnis was abandoned on July 20, 1890 and the buildings were sold to the public. In 1879, Granville Stuart and his friend Samuel T. Hauser along with Helena banker Andrew J. Davis established the Davis, Hauser and Stuart (DHS) cattle company. Stuart was the general manager and established the ranch headquarters of the DHS on Ford Creek near Fort Maginnis. Although surrounded by open range, the ranch was located close to the fort which provided both protection from a limited Indian threat but a ready market for cattle. However this proximity to Fort Maginnis proved to be a major problem as the army claimed rights to all the hay land surrounding the fort, including that of the DHS ranch. The dispute went on for several years before the army finally returned control of the hay land to the DHS in May 1882. In 1885, Lieutenant Colonel James W. Forsyth of the 1st Cavalry served as the fort's commander. Five years later he would command the 7th Cavalry at the Wounded Knee Massacre. In 1890, at the end of the Indian Wars, Fort Maginnis was abandoned. Epilogue Some of its buildings were purchased, dismantled, and rebuilt in Lewistown; one is the Abraham and Mary Walton Hogeland House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Includes historic photos. The site of the fort is located about northeast of present-day Lewistown, Montana. Some foundations and ruins remain.

He was acclaimed as one of the top Bollywood actors of the 1940s, along with the likes of Pahari Sanyal, Ashok Kumar and P. C. Barua, Master Vinayak. Adib is best remembered for his roles as Lord Rama in Bharat Milap (1942) and Ram Rajya (1943). These films had him pair with Shobhana Samarth as Sita, and the duo came to be celebrated as an embodiment of chaste love and \\"traditional Indian values\\". Adib and Samarth continued as the holy Rama-Sita pair in another Ramayana-based film, Rambaan (1948). During 1943–1950, the Adib- Samarth screen pair became popular enough to be featured on covers of religious publications and on thousands of calendars, which would be placed in Hindu temples as objects of worship. Ram Rajya (1943) also has the distinction of being the only film ever viewed by Mahatma Gandhi. Early life Prem Narayan Adib was born into a Kashmiri Pandit family of Oudh in 1917. His father Pandit Ram Prasad Adib was a lawyer by profession. The family name Adīb is a courtly Perso-Arabic reference to \\"learned, scholarly and culturally refined\\" persons. It had been bestowed on the family as an honorific in the 19th century by Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh. Prem Adib married Krishna Kumari Kaul (alias Pratima), a sister of Sheila Kaul. He died aged 42 in Bombay on Christmas Day, 1959. He is survived by a daughter Damini Sohoni and a grandson Ankush Sohoni. Lawsuit Adib was involved in a controversy when a minor actress, acting through her father, filed a case on him for breach of contract related to work. The case became known in legal literature as Raj Rani versus Prem Adib. Prem Adib, the defendant, won, as the case was void due to the girl's minority, and also because of which she could not contract her father to sign on her behalf.

Overview  The tea industry in Kenya is broken down broadly into policy, production, regulatory & research and trade & promotions. The main players are the Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Agriculture, Tea Board of Kenya, Tea Research Foundation Kenya Tea Development Agency (Holdings) Limited, Kenya Tea Growers Association, Nyayo Tea Zone Development Corporation and East Africa Tea Trade Association. This growth was attributed to favourable weather conditions coupled with improved global demand.  History   Colonial era  Tea production in Kenya started in 1903 with commercial farming starting in 1924 on colonalist-occupied farms. The 1929/30 world economic recession brought slump in the expanding tea industry as did other sectors of the economy. Due to shrinkage in the export market, the domestic market grew faster than anticipated. Competition for the domestic market was stiff and by 1931 the Kenya Tea Growers Association (KTGA) was formed to promote the interests of all persons concerned in the cultivation of tea in Kenya. Soon after, the Associated Tea Growers of East Africa (ATGEA) was established to foster the same objectives within the three east African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Tea growing and production was expanding elsewhere in the world. India, Ceylon (Now Sri Lanka) and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) were experiencing over-production which culminated in the introduction of international tea growing expansion restriction scheme signed under the first Tea Agreement in Amsterdam in 1933. By then Kenya had planted only about 4,800 hectares under tea and was subjected to the same expansionary restrictions as the major tea growers in the world. The colonial government prohibited local natives in Kenya to grow cash crops up to 1937 when commercial maize cultivation was liberalized followed by cotton. The colonial government's major arguments were that the local natives of Kenya could not effectively control diseases on their farms and this could be a threat to the “well-cared-for” European colonialist-owned farms. Lack of farm labour was also feared including competition with the Europeans for lucrative farming business. Before Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) there was Special Crop Development Authority (SCDA). In 1960, the colonial government created SCDA to promote growing of tea by Africans under the auspices of the ministry of Agriculture.  Post independence  Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) was established under a statutory legislation on 20 January 1964 under Legal Notice No. 42 Section 190 of the Agricultural Act (Cap 318 of the Laws of Kenya). The enactment charged KTDA with the statutory responsibility of promoting and fostering the development of tea for the small-scale tea growers within specifically scheduled tea growing areas. This legislation empowered KTDA to assist the small-scale tea farmers in expanding their holdings through the following goals and objectives; manage tea extension programme with the aim of improving the level of management and crop husbandry, develop and maintain a tea infilling programme to cover vacancies within farms, increase the area under tea by recruiting more farmers, providing tea-planting materials, collecting, purchase and handling of green tea, processing of the tea leaf, manufacturing of tea, marketing of the made tea, payment of the growers after the necessary deductions and development of sound technical, financial and managerial infrastructure.  Post privatization  The Agency took over the assets and liabilities of the Authority and also its mandate but under new terms entered into with the independent tea factory companies it manages. In June 2000, the company changed its name to Kenya Tea Development Agency Holdings Limited (KTDA (H) Ltd) in line with the recommendations made by a Government constituted tea industry task force of 2007. It is a public limited liability company owned by 54 corporate shareholders, who are KTDA’s affiliated tea-producing factories. KTDA provides management and other services through its various subsidiary companies under a management agreement with the factory companies. The Agency is contracted by the tea factory companies to; manage tea cultivation, develop and maintain tea husbandry, collect, weigh, handle and pay farmers for green leaf delivered, manufacture green leaf into tea, market the manufactured tea, develop and provide sound technical, financial and managerial infrastructure, provide services in procurement, ICT, Human Resources and other support services. KTDA (H) Ltd is currently managing 66 tea factories that serve over 560,000 smallholder tea growers cultivating about 130,000 hectares of tea spread in all the 17 counties of Kiambu, Murang’a, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Tharaka-Nithi, Meru, Kericho, Bomet, Nakuru, Kisii, Nyamira, Nandi, Kakamega, Vihiga, Trans-Nzoia and Narok. KTDA also manages two factories in Rwanda namely Shagasha and Mulindi. KTDA (H) Ltd established subsidiary companies for specific roles and responsibilities. The subsidiary companies are; KTDA Management Services Ltd that was established to specifically deal with management of the tea factory companies. Majani Insurance Brokers Ltd undertakes insurance portfolios for internal and external clients. Chai Trading Company Ltd undertakes all matters relating to warehousing, clearing and forwarding and general trading in teas. Kenya Tea Packers Ltd (Ketepa) undertakes tea blending and packing for local and export markets. Recently it has ventured into water bottling (Maisha brand). Green Land Fedha Limited is a micro-finance institution aimed at providing a variety of financial services to tea and non-tea-growing stakeholders. KTDA Power Company was set to develop small hydro power projects across the tea growing regions. During its period of existence, the growing of tea by small-scale sub-sector in Kenya has attained a niche in the global tea trade. As of July 2020, KTDA is under scrutiny by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya who accused directors of factories under the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) of attempting to block the implementation of reforms, meant to protect small-scale farmers from exploitation. https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/news/prepare-for-audit-munya-tells-ktda-1902996 KTDA's statement as follows: The Kenya Tea Development Agency (Management Services) Limited makes the following statement in light of misleading proclamations that have been made by certain persons regarding the second payment for the Financial Year 2019/2020 – which is due in October 2020: “The 54 tea factory companies managed by KTDA are yet to close their financial books for the year ending June 30, 2020. In this regard, there has been no communication from the tea factory companies to their farmers regarding the final payment, commonly known as “bonus”. Absence of this, any other pronouncement in this regard is mere speculation. The tea factory companies will communicate to their stakeholders, in their usual manner, at the appropriate time.” https://ktdateas.com/position-statement-thursday- july-16-2020/ Management services KTDA Management Services Ltd provides management services to the tea factory companies. The company is contracted by the tea factory companies to; manage tea cultivation, develop and maintain tea husbandry, collect, weigh, handle and pay farmers for green leaf delivered, manufacture green leaf into tea, market the manufactured tea, develop and provide technical, financial and managerial infrastructure, provide services in procurement, ICT, human Resources and other support services. Currently there are 66 operational tea factories under the KTDA (MS) Ltd management, each managed by a board of directors elected by and from among the growers of the specific factory catchment. These Factory Company Boards are responsible for policies, which govern; contracting management agents, management decisions with respect to procurement of goods and services for their respective factory, recruitment of employees, formulation of annual budgets and monitoring of financial expenditures, leaf collection and payments to farmers and governance and policy making. Ownership structure KTDA Holdings limited is owned by small–scale tea farmers. The 600,000 small scale tea farmers are individual’s shareholders in the 54 factory companies, which in turn are corporate shareholders of KTDA Holdings Ltd. KTDA Holdings Ltd is an investment company that owns a number of subsidiaries. These have been set up as part of its business and product diversification strategy. The subsidiaries are: *KTDA management service (MS) Ltd: manages the 69 processing factories through management agreements with respective 54 factory companies. *Chai trading company Ltd: core business is warehousing, blending and trading export of tea. It is based in Mombasa. *Majani insurance brokers Ltd; provides wide range of insurance brokerage services for all types of insurance covers *Greenland Fedha Ltd: micro finance company that provides affordable credit to farmers *KTDA POWER COMPANY Ltd: set up to invest in the energy sector and manage small hydro power projects for factory companies. *Kenya tea packers (KETEPA) Ltd:tea blending, packaging and distribution for local and overseas markets: ketepa has diversified into iced *ea and bottled water business with its safari iced tea and ketepa maisha water brands. *KTDA foundation: a non profit affiliate company that champions the corporate social responsibility activities of the group and leads its corporate social investment projects. The subsidiaries are investments on behalf of farmers. Dividends declared from profits made by these subsidiaries are paid to tea factories companies through KTDA Holdings Ltd. The factories in turn pay dividends to farmers. Products Being Africa's leading tea producer and largest exporter of black CTC (CUT, TEAR AND CURL). Kenyan tea grown in volcanic soils produces some of the best grades of tea, accounting for 25% of total tea exports into the world market. KTDA produces about 60% of Kenya’s tea, guaranteeing and standardizing the quality of tea. Tea leaf grading *Broken Pekoe1(BP1) – this grade forms about 13% – 15% of the total manufacture.

Because most of the fees are not performance-based, the managers will make money on the Trust’s investments no matter how well – or poorly – they perform.\\"Residential Properties Trust: The latest Inland fee generator?\\" Several fees are structured in a way that could incentivize external managers to act counter to the interests of investors.

This is considered problematic as the first user account created under OS X is furnished with administrator rights by default. By leveraging other security vulnerabilities on a system, such as an unpatched web browser, rootpipe could be used by an attacker to help gain complete control of the operating system. Emil Kvarnhammar of TrueSec, a security firm credited with the discovery, says that he found the vulnerability after several days of binary analysis. He recommends creating an account without administrative privileges to be used for normal everyday work, and using FileVault. An older exploit for the same issue was later published on exploit-db suggesting the issue dates back to June 2010. It appears the exploit was used by the author during a presentation on Trusteer Rapport at 44con 2011 . The vulnerability was reported to Apple Inc. in October 2014, and has been reported as present in OS X versions 10.7.5, 10.8.2, 10.9.5 and 10.10.2. OS X 10.10.3 was officially designated as patched by Apple, but Kvarnhammar (crediting Patrick Wardle) has blogged that the vulnerability is still present in that version. On 1 July 2015, Kvarnhammer noted that additional restrictions had been introduced in OS X 10.10.4, adding in a comment two days later that he believed the then-current versions of OS X 10.9 (with Security Update 2015-005) and 10.10 to be safe from the exploit.

It is superficially similar to Melaleuca cliffortioides but differs from it in the arrangement of the flowers and in details of the leaves. The flowers are white, fading to cream and are arranged in small heads on the sides of the branches. Description Melaleuca sophisma is a shrub growing to about tall with rough, grey bark. Its branchlets are glabrous (unlike those of Melaleuca cliffortioides). Its leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, linear to narrow oblong in shape and with 3 longitudinal veins. The flowers are white, fading to pink, and are arranged in heads in diameter in the axils of the leaves, each head with 3 to 5 groups of flowers in threes. (M. cliffortioides has single flowers in its leaf axils.) The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 12 to 15 stamens. The style is long (about in M. cliffortioides). Flowering occurs in November and December and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules long small teeth around the rim Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sophisma was first formally described as a new species in 2000 by Brendan J. Lepschi. The specific epithet (sophisma) is a Greek word meaning \\"false conclusion\\" or \\"fallacy\\", referring to the misidentification of this plant in this species as Melaleuca cliffortioides. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca sophisma has a restricted distribution in the Kundip district in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region. It grows in mallee and shrubland in sandy loam and clay loam. Conservation Melaleuca sophisma is listed as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is known from one or a few locations (generally five or less) which are potentially at risk.

Araki-ryu is a comprehensive system that specializes in the use and application of many traditional Japanese weapons such as spear, glaive, long and short sword, staff, rope, chain and sickle, and torite-kogusoku (grappling in light armor with weapons).  Introduction  Araki Ryu was founded in the Tensho period, approximately 1573. Its creation is attributed to Araki Mujinsai (or Muninsai) Minamoto no Hidetsuna. Torite-kogusoku techniques are the central focus of the martial tradition. Through an examination of the records of over forty lines of Araki-ryu, almost all emanate from the 2nd generation Mori Kasuminosuke. Araki Ryu spread quite widely throughout Japan: traditionally, upon receiving a teaching license, one established one's own independent dojo or line. Nonetheless, those separate lines maintained the same central set of grappling techniques. Currently, the central line of this martial tradition is located in Isezaki village in Japan, started by 9th generation shihan Komine Bundayu, and his student, Kurihara Iomji Masashige. The Isezaki line has preserved much of the original curriculum, though there is no way of knowing how close its current expression is to the original version. The Isezaki line focuses on an emphasis on grappling with weaponry. They also have numerous weapon-on-weapon kata, most likely developed through exchanges among the martial traditions of the area, most notably Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ryū and Kiraku-ryu.  The founder: Araki Mujinsai Minamoto no Hidetsuna 荒木夢仁斎源秀縄  In the Honcho Bugei Shoden (pub. 1711-1715 CE), there is a passage that states, \\"No one knows where Araki Mujinsai is from, and little is known of his deeds, yet his excellent techniques in torite are renowned.\\" Some lines of Araki-ryu speculate that he is from the family of the warlord Araki Murashige, who served as a general under Oda Nobunaga, but there is absolutely no documentary evidence to that assertion. Oral tradition of the ryuha asserts that Araki Mujinsai fought in the Chosen no Eki [war with Korea] and received praise from Hideyoshi, from whom he received the title, Nihon Kaizan, literally \\"Japan’s opener of mountains.\\" Common to all lines of Araki-ryû that descended through Mori Kasumi is the story which tells of the formation of the school. In Araki- ryû torite saitan no jo, (The rebirth of Araki-ryû), a text allegedly written by Araki Mujinsai, he refers to Fujiwara no Katsumi as the founder of the school. (NOTE: Although there is no definitive proof, there is some historical evidence within the annals of Takenouchi-ryu that Fujiwara Katsumi studied with the founder of Takenouchi-ryu, Takenouchi Hisamori, and that this may be a pseudonym for Miyamoto Munisai, the father of Miyamoto Musashi. In this text, it asserts that Katsumi like so many other founders of martial traditions before and after him, went to a mountain shrine, in Fujiwara's case, Atagoyama Dai Gongen, praying unceasingly [Atogodaiyama is a shrine in Kyoto prefecture under the auspices of a mountain elemental, a tengu Tarōbō daimyogi (太郎坊) of Mount Atago. After one hundred days of austerities, Fujiwara became, \\"enlightened into the mysteries of combat, and from that time forward, it became easy for him to defeat the strongest men throughout Japan.\\" The text continues, however, that, \\"he became lost in folly, and ceasing to love the art for itself, came only to care about winning. He acquired a filthy name.\\" This of course refers to the hubris which can result from power coupled with an absence of the ethical center upon which power should be built, which was requisite in all bujutsu ryuha. Though not written in this text, it is implied that either he regained his bearings and became a moral individual, or that this was the renaissance that the putative writer, Araki Munjinsai accomplished. This text is rather unique among martial art origin stories in its recognition of the intoxication of power.  Modern times  Araki-ryû was maintained in many areas of Japan, but by the 20th century, most lines became extinct. There are three remaining lines in Japan. 1. Two factions of Araki Ryu located in Isezaki, maintained by Kikuchi Kunimitsu and Suzuki Seiichiro. Although they chose to maintain their own dojo and separate administration, they are fundamentally the same. Araki-ryu was designated a cultural treasure of Isezaki in 1967 2. Araki-ryu gunyo-kogusoku, a tradition descending from Araki Buzaemon, quite distinct in many respects from the Isezaki Araki-ryu, but also sharing many elements in common. 3. Araki Mujinsai-ryu iaido - there are several factions of this group which exclusively practices sword drawing. Other than claiming the same founder, there is no apparent relationship in either technique or the names of the kata within the curriculum.

The film develops into a personal reflection on how the Fukushima disaster has affected not only the world, but Miyake herself and the family she once knew. Director After obtaining her degree in English History from the University of Tokyo, Kyoko Miyake moved to England to study English Witchcraft at Oxford University as a Swire Centenary Scholar.Umehara, Toshiya. \\"KYOKO MIYAKE: Film Director Always Looking for the Truth.\\" The Asahi Shimbun. The Asahi Shimbun Company, 21 Mar. 2014. Web. \\"My Atomic Aunt.\\" BritDoc. The BRITDOC Foundation, 1 Apr. 2013. Web. While on sabbatical from her doctoral program at Oxford, Miyake began to create historically themed independent documentary films. Her inspiration for her first international feature-length documentary, Surviving the Tsunami, came from her familial connection to the Japanese city of Namie, which had to be completely evacuated after the meltdown of the Fukushima Number One nuclear plant, and her anger at the way the disaster was being portrayed by the larger, mainstream media outlets. Kyoko has directed award winning documentaries including Hackney Lullabies, which have been screened in Berlin, Germany, London, England and Sydney, Australia. Kyoko Miyake currently resides in England. Synopsis Surviving the Tsunami brings together social, environmental, and personal perspectives of the national catastrophe of the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. In the documentary, Kyoko Miyake travels back to her hometown in Namie, Fukushima, to revisit her old life and assess the trauma still lingering from the disaster.\\"Surviving the Tsunami - My Atomic Aunt.\\" First Hand Films, 1 Jan. 2013.

The film also follows Bunsei Watanabe and Kyoko Miyake's Aunt Kuniko, two people who hope for the rejuvenation of Namie, despite the disaster that has occurred. Despite having lost family, friends, and jobs due to the meltdown and subsequent fear of the contamination zone, these two individuals are determined to rebuild their towns and neighborhoods and bring back the sense of community they once had. The film follows the residents of Namie, with emphasis on the experiences of Aunt Kuniko, as they come to terms with the reality of living in or near the \\"radiation zone\\" left in the wake the plant's nuclear meltdown.

She was also an activist in the German Jewish community and was ultimately detained in Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she died. Biography Krämer was born Clementine Sophie Cahnmann on 7 October 1873 in Rheinbischofsheim, a borough of Rheinau, Baden-Württemberg. Her parents were Gustav Cahnmann, a merchant, and Augusta Levi, and she had an older brother named Sigwart. When she was seven years old, the family moved to Karlsruhe. She remained in Karlsruhe until 1891, when she married banker Max Krämer and they moved to Munich together. In Munich, Krämer became involved in Jewish social work at the B'nai B'rith center in Munich, where she taught immigrant women in German and literature. She and a group of friends founded Israelitischen Jugendhilfe (Israelite Youth Aid), the first Jewish social work agency in Munich. Through that organization, she came to know the Jüdischer Frauenbund (Jewish Women's Association). She was one of the charter members of the association's Munich chapter as well as a member of its board of directors. In this role, she worked with women including Bertha Pappenheim. A pacifist, she served as a representative of the Frauenbund in the Jüdischer Friedensbund (Jewish Peace League). She was also tangentially involved in the German women's suffrage movement through the Munich branch of the Deutscher Verein für Frauenstimmrecht (German Society for Women's Suffrage). Krämer wrote extensively in the form of poetry, novellas and short stories, although little of her work was published. Her novella Die Rauferei was published in 1927 and others were published in newspapers, including Der Weg des jungen Hermann Kahn (1915), Erinnerungen (1920) and Der Grossvater und der Hofbauer (1915; reprinted in 1924), which were published serially. Her writings during World War I were \\"studiously devoid of Jewish issues and characters\\", as noted by Elizabeth Loentz, and were published in the mainstream press, while her postwar works were published only in the Jewish press. Common themes in her writing include Jewish family life, the relationship between German Jews and Judaism, and World War I, as well as pacifism and feminism. She also wrote numerous children's stories, including Fritzschen in Traumland (1919), although she had no children herself; most of the children in her stories were based on her six nieces and nephews. She often wrote in Bavarian dialects. During World War I, Krämer sought assistance from Jewish business owners in providing to families of dead soldiers. After the war, her husband's business went bankrupt and she began working at S. Eichengrün & Co., a Jewish textile shop, in 1929. After Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany in 1933, she made numerous attempts to flee Nazi persecution. Although a relative from the United States provided her with an affidavit of support, she was unable to leave Germany before World War II began and the American consulates in Germany were closed. She attempted to migrate to Denmark, China, and Cuba, all without success before being sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. Already ill before her detainment, she died on 4 November 1942, shortly after arriving at Theresienstadt. References Bibliography * Lorentz, Elizabeth.

AG Vie made this one of its specialties, creating for this purpose a separate \\"Pensions\\" division.La Compagnie d'Assurances Générales sur la Vie, 1919-1919, Paris, 1920  1969: creation of the AG Group  In 1969, the insurance company converted itself into a holding company, having under it a number of specialized companies, enabling it to make better use of its human and financial resources. In May 1971 the Dutch company Nationale-Nederlanden launched a hostile takeover bid on the shares of Antwerp company Securitas. Under the general direction of Maurice Frère, the AG Group launched on 21 May a counter-bid for Securitas. With a strong franchise in the Flemish part of Belgium and branches in the Netherlands, a portfolio of 400,000 policies and an annual premium income of 900 million francs, Securitas, specializing in property and casualty insurance, was an attractive acquisition for the AG Group, that had at the time only insufficient market shares in Flanders. In two years, from 1975 to 1977, the number of companies active in Belgium fell from 540 to 348. AG Group played an important part in this rationalization movement. In 1973 it acquired the Belgian branch of Swiss life insurer La Genevoise. The following year, it took a majority stake in Belgian insurance company Le Recours Belge and its subsidiaries Athéna and Démocratique-Vie (80 employees and 3,500 agents), further strengthening its position in property and casualty. In 1976, the AG Group also purchased La Médicale. In 1977 it concluded an operation on a totally different scale by purchasing PR-Phenix-1821 group, a holding company having under it 7 insurance companies and a real estate company. 750,000 customers joined the company in the process. Following these acquisitions, the AG Group had 3,414 employees.  1990: creation of the Fortis Group  In 1990, AG Group merged with Dutch company AMEV/VSB 1990, itself the product of the merger of bank VSB bank and the insurer AMEV. Following this first cross- border merger in the financial world, the Fortis Group became a reality. This double nationality would continue until 2012. In 1999, AG 1824 celebrated its 175th year of existence and changed its name to Fortis AG.  2009: birth of AG Insurance  In 2006, Fortis Insurance Belgium was born of the merger of Fortis AG and FB Insurance, which held the insurance activities of Fortis Bank. Following the collapse and dissolution of the Fortis Group in late 2008, Fortis became an international insurance group focused on Europe and Asia. It had a significant presence in Belgium via Fortis Insurance Belgium. The latter changed its name in 2009 to become AG Insurance. Today, with 75% of the shares, Ageas is the main shareholder in AG Insurance, with the remaining 25% held by BNP Paribas Fortis.

Cause of the rainfall  Primarily, the Jangma and other heavy rain seasons occur during June to July. But this rain occurred in August because the heavy rainfall moved to South Korea.

But it strengthened the next day, so rain fell in Jeju island and South Sea seaside. The rain was less than on August 18, but many accidents occurred because the ground was weakened.  August 21  In August 21, the rain was expanded to Gyeonggi and Gangwon because the rainfall moved north. A reservoir in Yeongcheon was destroyed because of the rain, and in Daegu, one child disappeared, and another died because the river overflowed.

Background Rabbi Moshe Yechiel Epstein first came to America in 1920 as part of a delegation from Agudas Yisroel, to raise money to help the Jewish refugees in Poland, which had been a major battleground between the Germans, Austrians, and Russians during World War I. While gone, Rabbi Moshe Yechiel's brother started to \\"fir rabbanus\\" in Ozherov, and made himself popular. When he returned and saw that people really liked his brother, he decided not make a controversy, and took over as rabbi of the smaller Polish town of Otwock. Polish antisemitism Shortly thereafter, Rabbi Moshe Yechiel was traveling on a train when a Polish man started up with him and spit on him. Rabbi Moshe Yechiel had been offered to be the rabbi of a synagogue for Ozerov immigrants on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and this incident—indicative of the treatment of Jews by the Polish people—was the impetus for him to apply to immigrate to the United States. After being rejected a first time, he was granted permission the second time and moved his Hasidic court to New York City in 1926. Rabbi Moshe Yechiel spent several years in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, and then moved to the Bronx. Holocaust Rabbi Moshe Yechiel's entire family in Europe was wiped out in the Holocaust. After World War II the remnants of the chasidim of Chentshin were left leaderless, their rebbe having been killed by the Nazis. They adopted the Ozherover Rebbe, a grandson of the first Chentshiner Rebbe, as their leader. Rabbi Moshe Yechiel was therefore given the title Grand Rabbi of Ozherov-Chentshin. Excited by the new state of Israel, Rabbi Moshe Yechiel moved to Tel Aviv in 1952, where he spent the rest of his life. Torah scholar Rabbi Moshe Yechiel was known as one of the great Torah scholars of his generation. His encyclopedic series of Torah commentaries entitled Eish Dos (11 volumes) and Be'er Moshe (12 volumes) are renowned for their depth. They were considered to be just a small sample of the Rebbe's erudition. Rabbi Moshe Yechiel died in 1971, and was succeeded by his grandson, Grand Rabbi Tanchum Becker (son of Rabbi Moshe Yechiel's daughter, Rebbetzin Miriam Becker and Rabbi Dovid Eliyahu Becker, a rav in Milwaukee, Wisconsin), the present Rebbe of Ozerov-Chentshin, who was trained by his grandfather to succeed him. Grand Rabbi Becker presently resides with his family in Bnei Brak, where he leads the Ozerov Torah Center, comprising a yeshiva, a kollel for married Talmudic scholars, and the Ozerover Beis Medrash.

The commanding officer of Fighter Squadron, Squadron Leader Johnny Summers, considered that it gave personnel \\"most useful experience in the handling and maintenance of their aircraft under adverse conditions\\".Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 399–400 One of No. 1 FTS's leading instructors during the early 1930s, Flight Lieutenant Frederick Scherger, was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 188–189, 202–203 In October 1931, during a flight to Adelaide to take part in an aero club pageant, Scherger had to land at Nhill, Victoria, in strong winds; his Bulldog finished up on its nose but the damage was slight, allowing him to complete the journey and win his air race with a top speed of .Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 401 Fighter Squadron's public displays often involved mock dogfights and simulated dive bombing, sometimes at night.

In October and November that year, the Bulldogs took part in several aerial displays in Victoria to commemorate the visit of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 335 The following month, Fighter Squadron aircraft escorted the Duke on his visit to Brisbane aboard HMAS Australia.

Marriage She became the third wife of the Roman general and politician Publius Quinctilius Varus.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65 Pulchra bore Varus a son, also named Publius Quinctilius Varus.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65 Her husband committed suicide in September AD 9 during the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, Germania InferiorAbdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg and she never remarried.

Through her friendship with Agrippina, Pulchra became the victim of the intrigues associated with the treason trial of Sejanus in AD 26.Tacitus, Annals 4.52. Gnaeus Domitius Afer accused her of an attempt to poison Tiberius, casting magic and immorality. She died in exile.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65 The Roman historian Tacitus considered the trial to be an indirect political attack against Agrippina. Her son became wealthy through the inheritance of both his parents. In 27, the younger Varus found himself facing accusations of treason and was nearly condemned. His trial has been attributed to the increasing distrust of Tiberius and the machinations of Sejanus.Abdale, Four days in September: The Battle of Teutoburg, p.65Barrett, Agrippina: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Early Empire, p.36&78 See also * Women in Rome References Bibliography * J.

It is run by its founder Stefan King. The company operates more than 50 venues in cities all over Scotland, most notably in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Their portfolio of venues include restaurants, bars, late night bars, nightclubs, cinemas and hotels. In recent years, the Group has become known for taking a special interest in the purchase and investment in listed buildings, or those with significant historical importance. These include former banks, newspaper headquarters and even a former High Court. History The G1 Group's first venue, Club X on Royal Exchange Square in Glasgow, was opened in 1990. In 1999, the Group opened The Corinthian Club in Glasgow, which would become their flagship venue in the city. In 2005, G1 Group branched out into the leased pub business, with the launch of The IONA Pub Partnership. In 2011, the Group moved into the former BBC headquarters in Queen Margaret Drive, which was built in 1869 and had housed BBC Scotland between 1936–2007. The G1 Group expanded into Edinburgh in 2011 after investing almost £30 million in acquiring a number of Edinburgh pubs. In 2017, G1 made their most significant investment to date with the purchase of the iconic Scotsman Hotel on Edinburgh's Northbridge.  Venues  G1 Group have grown in size substantially since being founded in the early 90s. Their most recent investments have been in the Hotel sector, where they have refurbished and relaunched several hotels in Edinburgh which were purchased in 2011 as part of the Festival Inns deal. The Group have also announced plans for further Hotel offers in Aberdeen and St Andrews, with the latter set to be launched as the Group's 2nd Scotsman Hotel. Controversies Two-way mirror The Shimmy Club in Glasgow, which is a G1 Group venue, hit headlines in 2013 after an ill judged design decision meant that patrons could view the hand wash area of the ladies toilets. The city's licensing board forced the venue to close for a week because of the risk of \\"predatory behaviour\\" towards young women, then ordered the club to remove the two-way mirror and put its staff through equalities training as a licensing condition. Disabled access In 2014, a disabled couple won a discrimination case against G1 Group after they were refused entry from the Polo Lounge, a G1 Group venue. Bouncers did not allow them into the Glasgow venue, which the couple had visited before, because they claimed it had no disabled facilities. Minimum wage In 2015, G1 Group was named and shamed for not paying the minimum wage to almost 3,000 workers. The firm illegally underpaid staff by more than £45,000 by making deductions from wages to pay for staff uniforms and training. G1 Group stopped this practice after it was named by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills in a list of companies that failed to pay the minimum wage. Sackings during Coronavirus pandemic In 2020, during the Coronavirus pandemic, the company sacked hundreds of staff over the phone. Staff members were told a slowdown in trade brought on by the Coronavirus crisis was behind the job losses.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish- news/hospitality-giant-g1-group-axe-21725911 References Companies based in Glasgow Hotel and leisure companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"G1 Group"},{"id":"46487616","text":"Fritillaria macedonica is a European species of flowering plant in the lily family, native to Albania, Macedonia, and Serbia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesTomovic, G., S.

The enclos paroissial comprises the parish church dedicated to Saint Germain of Auxerre, a funeral chapel/ossuary, a triumphal arch serving as the enclos entrance and the Calvary at Pleyben. The building is dominated by two bell-towers. One, that on the right, and known as the \\"Saint Germain\\", is in the Renaissance style and is topped by a lanterned dome whilst the second bell-tower has a Gothic style spire. Between the two bell-towers there is a stair turret with pinnacles and an ornate spire. It is a listed historical monument since 1846. Eglise Saint- Germain, calvaire et ossuaire The triumphal arch This dates to 1725. Over the arch there is a statue of the Holy Father holding out his crucified son for the world to see. It would have been through this entrance that the bodies of the dead would be carried for burial in the enclos. In the Breton language these entrances are called \\"Porz ar maro\\" (\\"The gate of the dead\\"). The ossuary Whilst starting out as an ossuary in the 15th century, the building was restored in 1733 and in 1736 was named the \\"Chapelle des Trépassés\\" and dedicated to Saint Simon and Saint Jude. The porch Above the bell-tower porch entrance there is a statue of Saint Germain which dates to 1555 and in the porch interior are statues of the apostles. Of these statues, that of John the Evangelist and James the Greater have been attributed to Roland Doré (sculptor). The statue of St Germain is inscribed \\"EN L'HONNEUR DE DIEV ET DAE ET MONSIEVR S GERMAIN CESTE CROIX FVST COMENCE 1555\\". There are also two further statues on the outside of the porch, one of the \\"Virgin of the Annunciation\\" and the other the \\"Angel of the Annunciation\\". These two statues and that of Saint Germain are attributed to the Prigent atelier. The church interior The nave is vaulted and decorated with painted and carved panels which date to the 16th century and carved horizontal beams. The church holds many fine statues. In the south transept there is a carving from wood dating to the 16th century which depicts Saint Yves standing between a rich man and a poor man. Also as one enters the choir there are niches containing statues of Saint Peter, Saint Corentin and Saint Germain, In the nave there is also a wooden carving depicting Christ on the cross with the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist on either side. These date to the 17th century. The baptismal fonts These date to the 17th century and are in front of an altarpiece depicting Jesus' baptism and John the Baptist's parents Zacharius and Elizabeth. There is also a statue of Saint Sernin holding Jesus' robe whilst he is baptized. The master altar The master altar at Pleben This has an altarpiece dating to 1667–1668 and a two-tiered tabernacle. The work is carved from oak and includes depictions of Jesus Christ, Saint Peter and Saint Paul and the four evangelists. Also depicted are Saint Germain and John the Baptist. The Rosary altarpiece The Rosary altarpiece The sculptor Jean Cévaer and the carpenter Jeané Le Seven combined to produce the \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece in 1696/98 and at a later stage the painter Olivier Grall added paintings. In the centre-piece the Virgin Mary is depicted handing the rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Sienna. Statues of Saint Luke and Saint John are positioned at the bottom of each of the side pillars and at the very top is a depiction of the Holy Father. A series of medallions spaced around the central tableau depict episodes from Jesus' life. The \\"Trépassés\\" altarpiece At the centre of this altarpiece is a painting depicting the \\"Descent from the cross\\". Stained glass windows The chevet windows at Pleyben In the centre of the church's chevet, there is a stained glass window depicting the Passion of Jesus Christ. There are further windows on each side of this central window. On the left the window depicts the Tree of Jesse and the window to the right depicts a tree representing the church featuring Jesus and his apostles. These windows date to 1879. A window in the south transept depicts scenes from the life of Saint Germain of Auxerre and a window in the north transept is dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. These two windows were executed in 1917 and are the work of an artist called Plouquet. The chevet At the base of the exterior of the chevet is a frieze with depictions of the sun, the moon and a skull. The sablières The church has some splendid examples of 16th century wooden sablières, the horizontal beams running along the top of the church wall where it meets the roof. At Pleyben they date to 1571, and cover five basic themes, both religious and mythological. Some 250 images are involved and the carvings also appear on the roof's cross rafters.

She put together a book, with others, supporting Māori rights. Life Caroline Harriet Palmer was bornObituary, The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 97, Part 1 and baptised in 1809 in Wanlip, Leicestershire, England. She was the daughter of Sir Charles Thomas Hudson Palmer and his wife. Her father had changed his name from Hudson to Palmer in order to meet the terms of an inheritance. In 1850 she married the Rev Charles Abraham and they emigrated to New Zealand shortly after where her husband wanted to work with George Selwyn. They arrived in Auckland on 6 August 1850 with their servant. Selwyn appointed her husband to lead a new college, St John's College, he had founded in Auckland. Her husband trained both Māori and European youths. Her husband was ordained to become the Bishop of Wellington whilst on a trip to England in 1857. Her only son, Charles was born the same year and he went on to be the Bishop of Derby. Abraham was a water colourist and her scenes of early New Zealand immigrant settlements are held by the National Library of New Zealand and Auckland City They are an important source of information from this period. During the New Zealand Wars she advocated for the Māori. The publication that she helped create was called Extracts of letters from New Zealand on the war question and it was published in 1861. She wrote it with her aunt and uncle, George and Sarah Selwyn, her own husband and Sir William and Lady Mary Ann Martin. George Selwyn was a Bishop and Sir William Martin was the Chief Justice. Abraham believed that the Māori people (then called natives of New Zealand and similar) were a proud race whose rights needed to be considered. This book was distributed privately after being printed in London. In 1862 a set of eight matching lithographs were published which were based on images created by Abraham. The images built into a panorama of Tamaki showing the site of St John's Chapel and school buildings in Auckland. The lithography was achieved by an unnamed sister of Rev. William C.

Springer Science & Business Media, 13 Apr 2011, p3 His archive is located at the University of Brighton Design Archives.University of Brighton Design Archives: WH Mayall Archive  Career  Early career  Mayall began his engineering career as a technical assistant for Heenan and Froude Ltd in their experimental department. He continued to work on experimental mechanical projects when he moved to Flight Refuelling Ltd. In 1947, Mayall joined Tiltman Langley Laboratories Ltd. based at Redhill Aerodrome, undertaking mechanical research and development work. It was in this role that Mayall became concerned with broadening the function of engineering design.Industrial Design and Production, The Production Engineer, April 1969 Council of Industrial Design In 1959 Mayall moved to the Council of Industrial Design where he was responsible for encouraging improvements to capital goods.Design in Engineering, Design, 202, 1956, p28-33 Mayall wrote articles and books, liaised with industry and mounted conferences and exhibitions such as More Value by Design.Management's Approach Must Alter, Design 266, 1971, p21 He presented papers at a variety of engineering conferences around the world, both on the design task, and role of the industrial designer in that task. Mayall was struck by the contrast between the practice of engineering and design and the 'design establishment', finding the latter to be elitist and divisive.WH Mayall on the Archives Hub He went on to become Senior Projects Officer at the renamed Design Council. Design Promotion Projects  Mayall retired from the Design Council in 1979, and under the name of Design Promotion Projects, he undertook independent design education and exhibition work. He also continued to write about his frustrations with the Design Council's approach to certain task, alongside his alternative vision for it. Design Theory Machines and Perception in Industrial Design  In his role as senior industrial officer for capital goods at the Council of Industrial Design, Mayall argued for early consideration of ergonomics and industrial design in product development.Mayall, WH, Design and Technology, Design 219, March 1967, p33 In his 1968 book Machines and Perception in Industrial Design, Mayall identified the dangers and difficulties created for machine operators by the increasing complexity of modern machines and examined the development of the \\"machine aesthetic\\" against social, technical and marketing factors. He also believed that organizing machines into coherent visual fields would help prevent accidents.Young & Giroux: Essays by Kenneth Hayes, Jesse Huisken & Mark Lanctôt, ABC Art Books Canada, 2001, More Value by Design  The More Value by Design conferences organized by Mayall, were intended to provide a forum for senior engineers to review the whole process of design in engineering from its fundamental aspects. \\"Firstly, the engineering industries must do much more homework, particularly at a management level, to achieve more value by design,\\" he said.Management’s Approach Must Alter, Design 266, February 1971, p21 Principles in Design  Mayall’s ten principles in design (Principles in Design (1979)) have been cited as an unofficial design canon and continue to be used in discussions of contemporary design.Taylor, Paul, Interpreting Mayall’s ‘Principles in Design’, ASWEC '01 Proceedings of the 13th Australian Conference on Software Engineering, 2001 Mayall’s ten principles are totality, time, value, resources, synthesis, iteration, change, relationships, competence and service.Principles in Design, London: Design Council, 1979, Role of the Designer  Mayall also believed that the designer was part of the change process; the ‘mastermind; that can initiate change with the type of products created.Low, Soozhee,Transformative Design: Understanding the Principle, Processes and Products to Create Transformative Design Outcomes, LuLu, 2006, p58  Accreditation  Mayall was a chartered engineer (CEng) and an Associate Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (AFRAeS).Artists' Papers Register - accessed August 2015  Bibliography  * Industrial Design for Engineers, London: Iliffe Books, 1967, * Machines and Perception in Industrial Design, London: Studio Vista, 1968, * More Value by Design, London: Council for Industrial Design, 1971 * Principles in Design, London: Design Council, 1979, * The Challenge of the Chip, London: HMSO/Science Museum, 1980 * Design Matters, London: Design Council, 1985, References 1998 deaths Industrial designers 1923 births British industrial designers English engineers 20th-century British engineers ","title":"W H Mayall"},{"id":"46487711","text":"Cutaneous branch of musculospiral may refer to: * Posterior cutaneous nerve of forearm, also known as external cutaneous branch of musculospiral nerve * Posterior cutaneous nerve of arm, also known as internal cutaneous branch of musculospiral nerve ","title":"Cutaneous branch of musculospiral nerve"},{"id":"46487741","title":"Josée Dayan"},{"id":"46487748","text":"Gene Schaerr in 2018 Gene C.

In 2015, he also submitted an amici curiae brief on behalf of 100 scholars of marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage. The brief argued, among other things, that consistent with patterns in European countries and American states that have adopted same-sex marriage, opposite-sex marriage rates will likely drop as a result of redefining marriage as a genderless institution. This will result, over the next fertility cycle (30 years), in fewer children born to married parents, fewer children born overall since unmarried women have lower birth rates, and more abortions since unmarried women have higher rates of abortion.see page 22 of Supreme Court amici brief.

Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce by measuring either their production of carbon dioxide and nitrogen waste (frequently ammonia in aquatic organisms, or urea in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of oxygen. Indirect calorimetry is the method by which the type and rate of substrate utilization, and energy metabolism are estimated in vivo starting from gas exchange measurements (carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption during rest and steady-state exercise). This technique provides unique information, is noninvasive, and can be advantageously combined with other experimental methods to investigate numerous aspects of nutrient assimilation, thermogenesis, the energetics of physical exercise, and the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.Ferrannini E.\\"The theoretical bases of indirect calorimetry: a review.\\" Metabolism. 1988 Mar;37(3):287-301. Scientific background Indirect calorimetry measures O2 consumption and CO2 production. On the assumption that all the oxygen is used to oxidize degradable fuels and all the CO2, thereby evolved is recovered, it is possible to calculate the total amount of energy produced. It should be clear that “energy production” means conversion of the chemical free-energy of nutrients into the chemical energy of ATP plus loss of some energy during the oxidation process. Respiratory indirect calorimetry, or indirect calorimetry (IC) as it is known by most authors, is a noninvasive and highly accurate method of metabolic rate which has an error rate lower than 1%.Marson F, et al. \\"Correlation between oxygen consumption calculated using Fick's method and measured with indirect calorimetry in critically ill patients.\\" Arq Bras Cardiol. 2004 Jan;82(1):77-81, 72-6. Epub 2004 Feb 12. It has high reproducibility and has been considered a gold standard method.Haugen HA, et al. \\"Indirect calorimetry: a practical guide for clinicians.\\" Nutr Clin Pract. 2007 Aug;22(4):377-88. This method allows estimating BEE and REE, and also allows for identification of energy substrates that are being predominantly metabolized by the body at a specific moment. It is based on the indirect measure of the heat produced by oxidation of macronutrients, which is estimated by monitoring oxygen consumption (O2) and carbon dioxide production (CO2) for a certain period of time.Pinheiro Volp AC, et al. \\"Energy expenditure: components and evaluation methods.\\" Nutr Hosp. 2011 May- Jun;26(3):430-40. doi: 10.1590/S0212-16112011000300002. The calorimeter has a gas collector that adapts to the subject and a system that measures the volume and concentrations of O2 and CO2 minute by minute. Through a unidirectional valve, the calorimeter collects and quantifies the volume and concentration of O2 inspired and CO2 expired by the subject. After a volume is met, Resting Energy Expenditure is calculated by the Weir formula and results are displayed in software attached to the system. Another formula used is: citing :M=VO_2left(frac{RQ-0.7}{0.3}e_c+frac{1-RQ}{0.3}e_fright) where RQ is the respiratory quotient (ratio of volume CO2 produced to volume of O2 consumed), e_c is , the heat released per litre of oxygen by the oxidation of carbohydrate, and e_f is , the value for fat. This gives the same result as the Weir formula at RQ = 1 (burning only carbohydrates), and almost the same value at RQ = 0.7 (burning only fat). ⊅∑′ History Antoine Lavoisier noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption, using multiple regression. The Dynamic Energy Budget theory explains why this procedure is correct. Indirect calorimetry, as we know it, was developed at the turn of the century's as an application of thermodynamics to animal life.Atwater WO, et al. \\"Description of neo respiration calorimeter and experiments on the conservation of energy in the human body.\\" US Department Agriculture, Off Exp Sta Bull 63, 1899 Although the development of indirect calorimetry dates back over 200 years, its greatest use has been in the last two decades with the development of total parenteral nutrition, interdisciplinary nutrition support teams, and the production of portable, reliable, relatively inexpensive calorimeters.McClave SA, et al. \\"Use of indirect calorimetry in clinical nutrition.\\" Nutr Clin Pract. 1992 Oct;7(5):207-21. Collection methods Four different gas collection and measurement techniques can be used to perform this test: *Douglas Bag: expired respiratory gases are collected on an inflatable airtight bag. (Douglas Bag) After completion of any test using Douglas Bags, gas collected must be analysed for volume and composition. *Canopy (dilution): The dilution technique is considered the gold standard technology for Resting Energy Expenditure measurement in clinical nutrition. The test lasts just few minutes and consists of making a patient lie down relaxed on a bed or on a comfortable couch, with the head under a transparent hood connected to a pump, which applies an adjustable ventilation through it. Exhaled gas dilutes with the fresh air ventilated under the hood and a sample of this mixture is conveyed to the analysers, through a capillary tube and analysed. Ambient and diluted fractions of O2 and CO2 are measured for a known ventilation rate, and O2 consumption and CO2 production are determined and converted into Resting Energy Expenditure.Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics \\"Measuring RMR with Indirect Calorimetry (IC).\\" Nutr Clin Pract. 2007 Aug;22(4):377-88. *Face mask (breath by breath): Indirect calorimetry tests are also often performed with a face mask, which is used to convey exhaled and inhaled gas through a turbine flowmeter able to measure the patient's breath by breath minute ventilation, at the same time a sample of gas is conveyed to the analyser and VO2 and VCO2 are measured and converted in energy expenditure. *Interface with a Ventilator (Intensive Care settings): In case the patient is mechanically ventilated, an indirect calorimeter can still measure breath by breath inhaled/exhaled O2 and CO2 if interfaced with the ventilator through the endotracheal tube. Applications Indirect calorimetry provides at least two pieces of information: a measure of energy expenditure or 24-hour caloric requirements as reflected by the Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) and a measure of substrate utilization as reflected in the Respiratory Quotient (RQ). Knowledge of the many factors that affect these values has led to a much broader range of applications. Studies of indirect calorimetry over the past 20 years have led to the characterization of the hypermetabolic stress response to injury and the design of nutritional regimens whose substrates are most efficiently assimilated in different disease processes and organ failure states. Indirect calorimetry has influenced everyday practices of medical and surgical care, such as the warming of burn unit and surgical suites and the weaning of patients from ventilators.

The line was originally planned as a narrow-gauge line through Reichenbach and Egesheim to Nusplingen. It was significant in the development and industrialization of the communities of the Heuberg plateau. Building The first sod was turned on 30 January 1913. The highest point of the railway would be at Gosheim station at 841 metres above sea level. The work should be finished in 1915. Because of World War I work was stopped in November 1916. The work was restarted in 1919. The work was stopped again in April 1920. In 1926 the work was restarted. At this time, 80% of the work was finished. The railway was built only as far as Reichenbach and not to Nusplingen. On 25 May 1928, the railway was opened to Reichenbach (Heuberg).

Description Melaleuca sparsiflora is a shrub which grows to a height of up to . Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate) so that the leaves are in four rows along the stems. They are long, wide, covered with short, soft hairs, narrow elliptic or narrow egg-shaped and crescent-shaped in cross section. The flowers are white or cream, a single flower (or rarely a pair) on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and are about in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flowers mature. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 11 to 26 stamens. Flowers appear in spring and the fruit that follow are woody capsules long.M. sparsiflora growing in the Dowak Nature Reserve M. sparsiflora fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sparsiflora was first formally described in 1847 by Nikolai Turczaninow in \\"Bulletin de la Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou\\".

History In 1875 the government established the North Central Province by combining Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts, making Anuradhapura the capital. At that time, there no English medium schools operated in this area. As a result, individuals such as Dr. Bonjune taught English to the local children accompanied by teachers from Jaffna. Dr. Bonjune began giving English language classes in 1874. By 1898 the Bishop of Jaffna, Henri Joulain, had registered the school as a public English school under the name St. Joseph's College. The school was named after the local Catholic church. The school accepted both Catholic children and children of other religious backgrounds as students. St. Joseph’s College was originally situated in the old town, but later moved to the new town. In 1914 the school changed from a co-educational institute to an all-boys school. The girls of St. Joseph's College were shifted to Holy Family Convent and Swarnapali Balika Vidyalaya. In its early days, the college had only three teachers and fifty students. In 1920, 1940, and 1968, there were 127, 350 and 450 students respectively. From 1898 to 1936, only J.S.C. classes were held in the school. The college had the capability to present students for E.S.L.C in 1936. When S.S.C. classes were offered in all three languages in 1940, it was the only school in North Central Province to do so. In 1957 the alumni planned to install a statue of Rev Maurice Legoc, a former director of the school (1919-1940), at a prominent nearby roundabout. A pedestal was constructed, at which Buddhist activists placed a small Buddha the night before the statue was to be erected. Under Sri Lankan law, such a statue cannot be removed once legally installed. The alumni filed a court case but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the statue of Buddha remained on that pedestal. In 1968 the college became a government school; until then the college was controlled by the Catholic Church. The head of the college, Joseph G. Jayasuriya, became the college's first principal. At that time Marsalin Jayakody wrote the college's current anthem in Sinhala. By then the college had become a Sinhala school. Tamil students were transferred to Vivekananda Vidyalaya and Sahira Vidyalaya. In 1972 the college was established as a Grade 1AB school. Rogesan Stanislaus was in charge of the college for 34 years, its longest-serving principal (1968–87). In 2017 the government opened a reverse osmosis water purification plant at the school.

A member of the prominent Mercouris family, he was the son of Spyridon Mercouris, long- serving Mayor of Athens in the early 20th century, and the younger brother of George Mercouris, far-right politician and Cabinet Minister. In contrast to his conservative father and brother, Stamatis would end up becoming a Member of Parliament for the Left; his daughter was the famous actress Melina Mercouri, Minister of Culture in the socialist government of Andreas Papandreou. Biography Stamatis Mercouris was born in Athens in 1895, son of Spyridon Mercouris and younger brother of George Mercouris. He graduated from the Hellenic Military Academy as a second lieutenant of Cavalry, and fought in World War I in 1917-18 and the Greco-Turkish War in 1919-22. He then left the Army and entered politics, taking part in the creation of the People's Party, Greece's main center-right political force at the time. Mercouris later left the People's Party and joined the National Radical Party, founded by the former General Georgios Kondylis. From 1929 until 1932, Stamatis Mercouris served as General Director of the Athens city government, under his father Spyridon Mercouris, who was then serving his last term as Mayor of Athens. In 1935 he served as Undersecretary to the Prime Minister's Office, during Kondylis's brief premiership. During World War II, and after the Nazis had occupied Greece, he founded a resistance organization, the Rizospastiki Organosis (literally \\"Radical Organization\\") which, though small in size, helped many Greek officers and soldiers escape to the Middle East, where they joined the Allied war effort. After the liberation of Greece from the Nazis in 1944, Mercouris resumed his political career and became a government Minister, serving as Minister of Public Order (1945 - 1946), and Minister of Public Works (1946). He founded his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party which was eventually disbanded, and later he ended up collaborating with the Greek United Democratic Left, serving as a Member of Parliament for them representing Athens, from 1958 until 1961, and from 1963 until his death in 1967.

He studied at Goldsmiths' College School of Art and the Royal College of Art and in Italy and Paris. While at the RCA his work came to the attention of Selwyn Image and Charles Ricketts, the latter becoming a great supporter of Cole's work which he compared to that of Alfred Stevens. In 1913 a life size figure of John the Baptist by Cole was erected at Holland Park. He was commissioned in 1914 by Ralph Knott to contribute twelve figure groups for the London County Hall, of which he completed five and a half before enlisting for military service in the Artists Rifles in 1916. He then served in France in 1917 as a second lieutenant in the 4th Reserve York and Lancaster Regiment before being transferred to military intelligence. After World War I Cole resumed his work, but Knott was dissatisfied with the work, and terminated his contract in 1921 with only six groups completed. Additional sculptures for County Hall were provided by Alfred Frank Hardiman in the late 1920s. Cole's work aroused some controversy at its unveiling, although he was still supported by Ricketts, Image and Laurence Binyon. While in the United States on military intelligence during 1917–18, Cole met his wife, Laurie Manly (d.1957). From 1921 to 1924, Cole continued his studies in New York, Italy and Germany before settling in Kingston, Kent. In 1924 he briefly succeeded Francis Derwent Wood as Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art, but left after a few months. Afterwards, he and his wife lived reclusively in Kingston in a house which Cole had commissioned, claiming it was the first steel-frame bungalow to have been built. At the outbreak of World War II the Coles were briefly imprisoned under suspicion of being Fascist sympathists, due to Cole's subscription to Il Popolo d'Italia, and his wife apparently an admirer of and correspondent with Benito Mussolini. Cole was reported as having destroyed much of his work soon after completion.

He was at the centre of a controversy after being called to examine a child suspected of having been murdered. History David Wark was a medical doctor born on Scotland, perhaps Ayrshire, and was a member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, licensed to teach anatomy and perform autopsies. His first marriage produced a son Robert Hunter Wark, and ended with the death of his wife. The widower Wark then emigrated to South Australia from Glasgow for a more congenial climate, arriving with his son aboard Welcome on 3 April 1839, having served as ship's surgeon. He went back to Britain, most likely with his son, and on 15 July 1841 left for Sydney, perhaps alone, aboard the ship Herald, and arrived in South Australia aboard Duke of Sussex in September 1841. He had settled in the Encounter Bay area and admired the local Aborigines, but was, as a medical practitioner, concerned with the fate of the females, who were succumbing to venereal diseases through interaction with European men. He was active in the Scottish community of Adelaide, a member of the St. Andrew's Society. In 1852 he was called on to give medical evidence at a Coroner's Inquest into the death of a child, whom her step-father, a Mr. Horgan, was accused of murdering. He was later lambasted by the Crown Prosecutor for not having conducted a post-mortem at the time. An altercation ensued, and Mann took his complaints to Judge Crawford, whose criticisms of Wark were published in the newspapers. Wark published a reasoned defence, nevertheless regretted he had not made a more thorough examination. In 1853 John Hart, M.L.C, about to embark on a visit to England, entrusted Wark with his resignation from the Chamber, to be tendered if needed in the interests of his electorate. Wark was accused, anonymously by a letter to the press, of colluding with Hart to give him (Wark) easy succession into Parliament. Wark denied such an imputation. He was in 1853 appointed a charter councillor for the East Torrens council district, and chairman in 1854. In July 1854 he was touted as a candidate for the forthcoming election to the Legislative Council, but in the event, he did not stand. Wark was elected unopposed to the South Australian House of Assembly for the seat of Murray and sat from February 1857, was re-elected unopposed in 1860 and died on 3 March 1862. The family lived at Alton House, perhaps earlier named Auldton, Magill, since demolished, and for which Alton Street, Magill was named. Family Wark's first marriage was to Mary Hunter, some time around 1830; they had four sons, of whom only Robert Hunter Wark (1833 – 23 April 1880) survived. After the death of his wife, Wark left for Australia. He married again, to Catherine Keeling, on 28 April 1842 at the residence of Matthew Moorhouse in North Adelaide. The ceremony was performed by Rev. T. Q. Stow. Catherine was the daughter of James and Sarah Keeling of Hanley, Staffordshire, and emigrated with her widowed mother in June 1839 aboard Sir Charles Forbes. Sarah died on 1 February 1854 at Alton House. *Margaret Orr Wark (4 August 1843 – 29 August 1917) married George Rolfe (1808 – 18 December 1871) in San Francisco on 5 November 1870. She married again, to Robert Gemmell Gibson (c. 1840 – 22 August 1897 in Wellington, NZ) on 1 August 1872. and had two daughters, Beatrice Gibson (born in Victoria, 15 October 1873) and Berta Jean Gibson (born in NZ). *James Keeling Wark (16 September 1845 – 3 May 1886), on 2 November 1876, married Mary Newland (28 May 1854 – 17 March 1942), a niece of Simpson Newland.Mary was a grand-daughter of Ridgway William Newland by his first wife. His second wife Martha Newland, née Keeling (c. 1797 – 13 April 1870), was a sister of David Wark's wife.

He discovered a space in the Great Pyramid, now known as \\"Davison's Chamber\\", or \\"first relieving chamber\\". Life He was the fourth son of George Davison of Little Mill, Longhoughton, Northumberland; his sister Jane was mother of John Yelloly the physician. He was British consul at Nice, where he had consular privileges from September 1769, and then from 1778 in Algiers, leaving in 1783.David Wilson, Consular Officials in the Ottoman Empire (PDF) at p. 48 He had been hoping for Naples, asking Thomas Percy for the influence of the Duke of Northumberland in support. He received a government pension in 1786. Davison rented a house in Twickenham, where his son Nicholas Francis was born, from the merchant Daniel Twining, father of Thomas Twining. He died in Alnwick on 23 February 1809, aged 72 or 73, and was buried at Longhoughton. Sir Henry Taylor, brought up in County Durham where his father was a friend of Davison, recollected that he wore a pigtail (queue), one of the last men of his generation to do so. He sold the home farm Little Mill to Lord Grey. Travel writings Davison's Chamber is the lowest of what are five \\"relieving chambers\\" above the King's Chamber in the Great Pyramid In 1763 Davison travelled to Egypt with Wortley Montagu, whom he knew through the London bookseller Thomas Becket. Acting as Montagu's secretary, he documented their journeys for the Royal Society. Montagu and Davison set off from Livorno in April 1763, for Alexandria. Montague spent time in Rosetta in the spring of 1764.Fatma Moussa-Mahmoud, A Manuscript Translation of the \\"Arabian Nights\\" in the Beckford Papers, Journal of Arabic Literature Vol. 7, (1976), pp. 7–23, at p. 11. Published by: Brill. Davison himself spent 18 months at Alexandria, and then the same length of time at Cairo, and visited the pyramids. It was in 1765 that, in the Great Pyramid, Davison followed up an echo he heard in the Grand Gallery. Through a passage deep with bat dung, he found, after a crawl of 24 feet, a space above the King's Chamber. He later conjectured about the architectural role of the chamber he discovered, in a letter to Joseph White of 1779, coming to conclusions comparable with those later published by Richard William Howard Vyse. An engraving after a drawing by Davison of the interior of the Great Pyramid appeared in volume 2 (1807) Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt by Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt.http://digi.ub.uni- heidelberg.de/diglit/sonninidemanoncourt1807bd2/0369?sid=72160c8e96dd88a92c8b62eb8051948a It was published via the intervention of Louis Joseph d'Albert d'Ailly, the Duc de Chaulnes; but Davison claimed the Duc had come by this and other drawings of his by underhand means. Extracts from Davison's journals were published in 1817 by Robert Walpole, in his collection Memoirs Relating to European and Asiatic Turkey. They included descriptions of the chamber, and the vertical shaft in the Great Pyramid; and catacombs in Alexandria. Family Davison married Margaret Thornton on 9 July 1787, in London. Their son Nicholas Francis became a physician. Their third daughter Margaret married Edward John Howman in 1822. The fourth daughter, Eleanor, married Adam Atkinson of Lorbottle. Davison also helped to bring up his nephew John Yelloly, after his father died.

The career of Griffith has been a varied and interesting one, having fought for, and served his country with distinction in a variety of capacities. His father, a captain of the Royal Marines, landed on the shores of the Cape in 1818. Twelve years later Griffith was born at Grahamstown. He was educated there and at Cape Town; his father introduced merino sheep into the Cape Colony. Colonel Griffith next featured as a fighter in the 1840s; he fought in all the Kaffir Wars of the period. He was a lieutenant in the Hottentot Levy, also in the Kaffir Police; and was a Captain commanding the former in the Kaffir War of 1851-52. For his services he was awarded the medal, and repeatedly commended in General Orders. He was appointed Civil Commissioner and Resident Magistrate of Albert in 1858, and was subsequently promoted to the districts of Queenstown, Grahamstown, and Albany. By special request of Sir Philip Wodehouse, he was transferred in 1869 to the important division of King William’s Town. In 1871 he was Governor’s Agent and Chief Magistrate of British Basutoland. Six years later he was again in the “tented field” commanding the Frontier Armed Mounted Police Force. He quelled, in that year, the outbreak of the Galeka and Gaika tribes, at which period he ranked in the Transkei Command as a Colonel in His Majesty’s Army, and was Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial and Colonial Troops on the eastern side of the Kei River. Later he was made Commandant-General of the whole of the Colonial Forces of the Colony, and soon afterwards received the cordial thanks of both Houses of Parliament for the great services he had rendered the country. In the field of politics he has not been less successful, as was evidenced in 1888 when he contested the Tembuland and defeated a strong opponent. At the General Election of the same year he was returned unopposed for the same seat. Griffith returned to England after his service in the Cape and resided at 30, St. James’ Road, Southernwood, East London, he married Dorothea Mounsey Gilfillan, the daughter of 1820 Settler, Lieutenant William Frederick Anderson Gilfillan, C.C., of the Cradock District. Sir Henry Barkly was appointed High Commissioner of the Cape Colony on 31 December 1871. He annexed Basutoland and Charles Griffith was appointed Chief Magistrate and Governor's Agent.

Early years Donald was born at Redbank, Queensland, to parents Andrew Donald and his wife Jessie (née Simpson) and was educated at Redbank State School and Ipswich State School. He then began an apprenticeship as a cabinetmaker, attending Ipswich Technical College before entering the mining industry as a winding engine driver. It was this job that led to a long association with Queensland Colliery Employees Union where he started out as a union organizer and was Vice President several times in the 1940s.Jim Donald - a short biography -- Ipswich Historical Society. Retrieved 22 April 2015. Political career When the member for Bremer, former Premier Frank Cooper, retired from politics in March 1946, Donald was chosen by the Labor Party to be their candidate at the by-election which was held on the 25 May 1946. Donald went on to win the seat over the Queensland People's Party candidate, Harold Shapcott, by 5643 votes to 3246. Donald held Bremer until the seat was abolished prior to the 1960 state election when he moved to the newly created seat of Ipswich East which he went on to hold from 1960 until his retirement from politics in 1969. Although Donald was in parliament for 23 years, he was never appointed to the ministry, almost certainly due to having refused to support a bill introduced by the Labor Party concerning miners' pensions and entitlements. He was, however, secretary of the State Parliamentary Party for 21 years; and when the leader of the opposition, Les Wood, unexpectedly died in 1958, Donald became the new opposition leader on the 14 April of that year. He stood aside from the position to make way for Jack Duggan on 17 August 1958, after Duggan had won the seat of North Toowoomba in the by-election necessitated by Wood's death. During his political career, Donald earned a reputation as one of the most modest and unassuming gentlemen ever to serve in the Parliament. He had a very quiet manner of debate, which was always well backed up by a great deal of preparation and research. In addition he was an advocate of temperance, on which his views were rigid and uncompromising. Personal life Donald married Mary Jane Dobbie on the 27 September 1916 and together had one son and one daughter. Mary died in 1955,Family history research -- Queensland Government births, deaths, marriages, and divorces.

History Mutiny on the Bounty was founded in April 2004 by Nicolas Prezor and Sacha Hanlet. Their first release was a split album in 2005, with \\"Treasure Chest At The End Of The Rainbow\\" also a Luxembourg-based band, in which Sacha Hanlet was also active. At this time, the band consisted of David Schmit (guitarist of Eternal Tango), Luciano Lippis and the two founding members. This split album was licensed by the Canadian record label New Romance for Kids, for Canada, United States and Japan. In 2007, Moreira left the group and Claudio Pianini joined them as bassist.

The Man, Red Sparowes, 31 Knots and Fear Before the March of Flames. Nevertheless, the band alongside continued to work on songs for their debut album. Each member of the band delivered a variety of song fragments, which were then edited together. Thus arose songs that involve various influences, but can nonetheless be regarded as the work of a band. It took ten months until the songs were ready to record. After nearly two years of preparation, they finally went in the studio to record their debut album Danger Mouth with Philippe Matgé one of the best sound engineers throughout Luxembourg. The album was mastered in New York City in the West WestSide Studios by Alan Douches. Danger Mouth was published in 2009 by Redfield Records in Germany and Big Scary Monsters Records in England. Other international concerts followed, inter alia a gig at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin Texas.www.motb.net/bio In August 2011 Pianini and Lippis were replaced by Cedric Czaika and Clement Delporte. Also in 2011, they were seen in Govinda van Maeles “We Might as Well Fail” documentation. Mutiny on the Bounty's second album Trials was recorded within one month in Seattle in the Red Room Recording Studio of the well-known American producer Matt Bayles. The band sent Bayles a link with a few of their songs, and after a meeting in the context of their performance in Austin they had convinced him to record their new album. The production financed the band through crowdfunding.

These women are involved in critical assessments of contemporary digital culture and, together, work to exploit the potential for creative inquiry lying dormant in the deep web. Outside of Deep Lab, the members engage in activities that range from magazine editing, journalism, various forms of activism, and teaching. Research by the collective involves privacy, code, surveillance, art, social hacking, race, capitalism, anonymity, 21st century infrastructures, and useful skills in tangible situations and is both an independent and collaborative effort. Deep Lab draws influence from Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), Cypherpunks, Guerrilla Girls, Free Art and Technology Lab (F.A.T.), Chaos Computer Club, and Radical Software.Deep Lab. Deep Lab, published Dec. 2014.  Background  The Deep Lab collective was created \\"Because we wanted to be together. Because the original computers were women. Because it can't not. Because we are stronger as a pack. Because I’m trying to stay connected to the self. Because sharing is caring. Because we want to dig deeper. Because girls just wanna have fun. Because you shouldn't have to ask for permission.\\"Deep Lab. “Why does Deep Lab exist?,” Home, http://www.deeplab.net/#what, accessed 11 March 2017. In 2014, the collective gathered at the Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University and published a compilation of reflections on digital culture, the post-Snowden Internet, and cyber-feminism called Deep Lab.Addie Wagenknecht. “Deep Lab,” The Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry, http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/projects/deep-lab, accessed 12 March 2017. The beginning of Deep Lab were organized by Abbie Wagenknecht who was a fellow at Studio through a grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts with the idea of examining how themes of privacy, security, surveillance, anonymity, and large-scale data aggregation are problematized in the arts, culture, and society. The key issues that Deep Lab is seeking to address is the discrimination towards marginalized people at the hands of “corporate dominance, data mining, government surveillance, and a male- dominated tech field.”David Riley. “Deep Lab,” Topical Cream, released 3 Feb. 2015, http://topicalcream.info/editorial/deep-lab-2/ The collective has noted that internet privacy has different meanings to men and women, citing the exposure of female celebrities’ nude images, and claims that big business doesn’t have an interest in making privacy easy for women as it doesn’t help their profit margins. Founder Addie Wagenknecht explains that the lack of privacy expansion will not change until women and the marginalized divorce themselves from corporations in favor of alternatives. In reference to the lack of women in technology, Deep Lab cites large disproportions in female enrollment in computer science programs and STEM degrees, culture marketing and associating computers and technology with men, and a failure of computer science to beckon to its history despite the pioneers of computer science being women. The collective also encourages women to become educated in technology and code in order to protect themselves from both personal attacks and government surveillance in addition to encrypting email, hard drives, using secure chat spaces with the ultimate goal of ending the taboo of women in technology.  Residencies  Members of Deep Lab collaborating during their residency at Studio Studio The published 2014 work Deep Lab was written in five days by the original gathering of the cyber-feminist collective and was a capstone to the women’s residency in Studio.Deep Lab. “The Deep Lab Book,” The Frank-Ratchye Studio for Creative Inquiry, http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/publications/deep-lab-book, accessed 12 March 2017. In the 240-page book, Deep Lab details all of the research conducted, beginning with notes from a talk by Jen Lowe on the role Big Data plays currently and how it will play out in the future. The essay covers how Big Data is able to learn about people based on simple interactions on social media or through credit cards, how Data may be used to silence people’s voices and police them, and mentions how the Deep Web, although a dark and dangerous frontier, might offer women and marginalized people the opportunity for sanctuary. Claire Evans writes on the history of cyberfeminism with previous groups such as VNS Matrix, how the internet is still a male-dominated venue, and how the internet is lending itself to strength the female voice. Other essays in the manifesto include one by Denise Caruso on privacy, how corporations are leeching data off of consumers in attempted to make as much money off the human being as possible, and how Deep Lab is teaching those who will listen how to fight these parasites.Denise Caruso. \\"You Are Occupied. Or Not.,\\" Deep Lab, published Dec. 2014. 97.

New Museum  In May 2015, Deep Lab was invited to NEW INC at New Museum for a week-long residency for the women of the collective to continue their initial work with privacy, security, surveillance, anonymity, and data aggregation as well as how those themes tie into The Invisible City. The Invisible City centered around the future of the city under the lens of arts and culture and raised questions about transparency and surveillance, citizenship and representation, expression and suppression, participation and dissent, and the invisible forces at work in cities.NEW INC. “New Museum,” Events, Deep Lab. http://www.deeplab.net/new-museum/. accessed 20 March 2017. As a part of the residency, Deep Lab collaborated with the community present at NEW INC as well as other community groups such as Data & Society. The residency occurred at the same time as New Museum’s IDEAS CITY festival with the aim of Deep Lab introducing “critical issues in technology and society to a wider audience through discourse and public engagement.” Outside of the residency, Deep Lab engaged with the public through performance art of drone painting with director Addie Wagenknecht, NEW INC’s Dan Moore, and Becky Stern. In addition, panels and discussions were held surrounding topics such as “Surveillant Anxiety,” “Data and Social Justice,” “Pipelines to Tech Empowerment,” and “How to PGP in 10 minutes or less.” At the end of the residency, Deep Lab produced and open-source toolkit about what was discovered in IDEAS CITY so it would reach a larger audience.NEW INC. “Deep Lab.” NEW INC. http://www.newinc.org/deep-lab/ .

It depicts a boy three or four years of age, standing in red clothes, with birds and cats. It is also known as Goya's \\"Red Boy\\". It was described by art historian Claus Virch in 1967 as \\"one of the most appealing and successful portraits of children ever painted, and also one of the most famous\\". The painting has been held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York since 1949. History The painting was commissioned by the boy's father, (1756–1816), conde de Altamira, who held many titles and was also a director of the Banco de San Carlos. Altamira was one of the six dignitaries of the newly formed Banco de San Carlos painted by Goya between 1785 and 1788. In 1786, after painting several portraits of the court, Goya was nominated painter to Charles III, and continued from 1789 as court painter of his successor Charles IV. Altamira hired Goya to paint several family portraits. This painting, from 1787–88, depicts Altimira's youngest son, Manuel, who was born in April 1784 and died at age eight on June 12, 1792. Goya also painted a portrait of another of Altamira's four sons, (1777–1837), and of his wife María Ignacia Álvarez de Toledo y Gonzaga, the condesa de Altamira (1757–1795) with their infant daughter, María Agustina (born 1787). Description Manuel is dressed in a red silk costume with white collar and cuffs, silver satin sash, and white shoes decorated with bows. He holds a string attached to his pet magpie, with Goya's visiting card in its beak. To Manuel's left is a cage of finches, while three cats are intently watching the magpie on his right. The boy's pale face and bright costume contrast against the drab olive-brown background. Analysis The pets in this portrait have been analysed in many different ways. The caged birds may symbolize the innocent soul, the cats may be an evil force. For example, Goya shows a cat among the creatures in The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, part of The Caprices. Legacy The painting was hung with other family portraits at Altamira's palace in Madrid. It was auctioned in Paris in 1878 for 1,200 francs, and then acquired by the playwright Henri Bernstein before 1903. Bernstein based parts of the stage design for his 1924 play La Galerie des glaces on the painting, and then sold it to the art dealer Joseph Duveen in 1925 for 450,000 francs and £9,000. In 1926, Kathryn Bache Miller fell in love with this painting while at the Paris art gallery of Joseph Duveen. Her father, Jules Bache, then purchased it for $160,000. The painting was hung prominently in her living room. Her interior decorator, Billy Baldwin, described her attachment to it as if it were a living being. Her father bequeathed the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on his death in 1944, and his estate transferred the painting to the museum in 1949, but it was allowed to be shown periodically in Miller's apartment until she died in 1979. From April 22 to August 3, 2014, the museum reunited Manuel with his parents in the exhibit Goya and the Altamira Family. The exhibit also included portraits of his two brothers and his sister.

Concept The primary layer is a fun-filled nostalgic trip of the 80’s, the glorious school days, the eccentric teachers, and the school pranks. The innocence of that age is captured through the carefree lives of Gajya, Satya, Raju and Savio. They live in Vartak Nagar which is located in Mumbai and attend an English medium school. The fathers of Raju and Satya work in Sitaram mills. The second layer, which follows the animosity between the don BalaChavan and union leader Kunwar Singh, is a look at the gangster era in the 80s in the city of Mumbai. Bala Chavan is the ferocious gangster working for the mill ownerandKunwar Singhis an honest mill union leader who fights for the rights of workers. Violent clashes between Bala Chavan and Kunwar Singh lead to an event which changes the lives of the four children protagonists. The boys suddenly find themselves in adult-like situations and evolve as true and lifelong friends in the process. The Bombay mill strike of 1982 is the driver for the story of Vartak Nagar. The catalyst used to make these two worlds collide is the historical Textile mill strike of Mumbai, considered the one landmark event which transformed Mumbai from an Industrial town to a commercial city. The film is an entertaining roller coaster ride and promises to help us relive our carefree childhood days. The film also takes a hard look at how a seemingly small event snowballed into the longest running strike in history eventually converting the textile mills into swanky malls in the city of Mumbai two decades later. Vartak Nagar is a funny and violent \\"Coming of age period film\\" about the childhood we share, the trust we take for granted, the promises we break and evolve as true friends in the process. The film was screened at Cinequest Film Festival (San Jose, California) and received a great response. Cast * Jimmy Shergill as Bala Chavan * Raghu Ram as Kunwar Singh * Shweta Gulati as Mona alias Lal Pari * Jayesh Kardak as Satyanarayan Moorthy alias Satya * Ashitosh Gaikwad as Raju Thorat * Shantnu Rangnaker as Gajanan Shenoy alias Gajya * Mohak Meet as Savio Fernandes Takes 'ATUL TAISHETE’s TAKE (Director)' Vartak Nagar tries to create the Bomaby of the 80s while attempting to mix genres ranging from a coming of age action film to a gangster drama while trying to trace the history of how the industrial town of Mumbai became the commercial hub called Bombay. 'AMIT AGARWAL’s TAKE (Producer)' Vartak Nagar is one of those rare films which has the potential to be a huge commercial hit, garner critical acclaim and also perform well internationally. I had absolutely no hesitation in backing the film. 'JIMMY SHEIRGILL’s TAKE (Actor)' The character of Bala Chavan was amazingly well fleshed out and something which I had never done before. I really enjoyed bringing out the menace of Bala Chavan on screen. 'RAGHU RAM’s TAKE (Actor)' The character of Kunwar Singh as an honest and upright union leader with a heart of gold attracted me to Vartak Nagar. I love the way Kunwar Singh has been portrayed as a man with the right amount of empathy and toughness.

Winter House is a historic house on Winter's Hill in Kingfield, Maine. Built in the mid-1890s, it is a particularly elegant example of Colonial Revival architecture in a remote inland community. The house was designed by Francis and Freelan Stanley, multi-talented twins best known for development of the Stanley Steamer, and the house's original heating system was designed around a railroad engine boiler. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Winter House is set on a hill north of the small village center of Kingfield and just south of the West Branch Carrabasset River. The hill affords fine views of the village and the Western Maine Mountains. It is a roughly square wood-frame structure, with a hip roof and a stone foundation. Its front facade is symmetrical, with rounded two-story bays flanking the center entrance, which is sheltered by a portico supported by groups of fluted columns, with a dentillated cornice beneath its hip roof. The entrance itself is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a half-oval fanlight window, with pilasters matching the columns where the portico joins the wall. The rounded bays have curved three-part windows, with narrow sashes flanking large picture windows. Three hip-roof dormers pierce the front roof line. The main block of the house is flanked on either side by lower wings. The interior has retained much of its original decorative work despite a variety of adaptive reuses of the building over time. The house was built for Amos G. Winter, a local grain merchant and owner of a general store. Winter was friends with the Stanley twins, who were also Kingfield natives. Among the innovations the Stanleys put in the building were a steam-driven heating system whose centerpiece was a railroad engine boiler. A steam-driven elevator was planned but not installed. The house was occupied by the Winters until 1950, and was then adapted for use first as a doctor's office and clinic, and then as a restaurant and inn. It has since been converted to multiunit residential use.

History In the pre-colonial era, inhabitants of what is now Ghana primarily drew their water directly from natural sources such as streams, lakes, and rivers. Prior to World War I, the first public water system was established in the then Gold coast by the British who were then colonizing the Gold Coast. In by that time the 1920s, other major towns and cities started having water systems which were built purposely to be used in some urban areas, including Winneba, Kumasi, and the then colonial capital Cape Coast. Ghana Water Company Limited was established on 1 July 1999, following the conversion of Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation into a state- owned limited liability company under the Statutory Corporations (Conversion to Companies) Act 461 of 1993 as amended by LI 1648.

It was established in 1928 as an independent organisation, becoming a branch of the newly formed Society of Architects in Wales (as the RSAW was initially styled) in 1970 upon the restructuring of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The Society champions better buildings, communities and the environment through architecture and its members. As of 2014 it represented over 120 chartered architects in the region. The RSAW is the Wales region of the RIBA. RSAW was granted Royal status by the Privy Council in 1994. Events The Society is noted as being a particularly active branch of the RIBA and organises an annual series of well-attended building visits and lectures, usually held from early autumn through to late spring. In line with NWSA's ethos of promoting architecture to a wider audience, these events are open to non-members and all with an interest in design and architecture. Recent visits have included the 2014 Stirling Prize-winning Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, Copper Kingdom, Amlwch, recipient of the RSAW Building of the Year 2014 and Cefn Castell, Criccieth, RSAW Small Project of the Year, 2015. Recent lectures have included Niall Maxwell of Rural Office for Architecture and Dan Benham of Loyn & Co. A further series of events, including a forum with RIBA Chief Executive Harry Rich, is currently being planned to commence in autumn 2015. Governance The Society is governed by its elected Council. Councillors are elected for a three-year term at the Society's Annual General Meetings and can serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. Council meets every two months and is led by the Society's President, who serves a maximum two-year term. There is no maximum term for the Society's Honorary Secretary and Honorary Treasurer offices.

Killam (1900 – 26 July 1965) was an American-born Canadian philanthropist. She was the wife of Canadian financier Izaak Walton Killam. When he died in 1955 she inherited his fortune and continued to build it until her own death 10 years later. She engaged in philanthropic activity during her lifetime and left her estate to a number of Canadian educational and research institutions. Family background Dorothy Ruth Brooks Johnston was born in 1900 in St. Louis, Missouri. Her father, John Thomas Morris Johnston, was a wealthy banker, and her mother was the former Florence Brooks. At the age of 19 her father opened a store in Ashland, Missouri and eight years later established a bank, of which he became president, in the town. He later spent several years as a Baptist minister, while remaining president of the Ashland bank. He was pastor of a church in St. Louis from 1897 to 1907. He then became a history professor at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He established banks in Kansas City, Missouri, Denison, Texas, and Muskogee, Oklahoma, and returned with his family to St. Louis. By 1915 he was described as a \\"millionaire St. Louis banker\\", and was said to be considering running for the United States Senate. Marriage Dorothy Johnston met Izaak Walton Killam at a party when she visited a friend in Montreal in 1921. They were married in St. Louis on 5 April 1922. Killam had been president of Royal Securities since 1915, and had bought the brokerage firm from Max Aitken in 1919. He suffered serious financial losses in 1921, but recovered his fortune within a few years and went on to become extremely wealthy, with major interests in pulp and paper and electric power companies, among many others. The Killams, who had no children, lived primarily in Montreal, where Royal Securities was headquartered. They also had two winter homes in Nassau, Bahamas and an apartment on New York City's Upper East Side. Dorothy Killam collected jewelry and was particularly fond of diamonds. Her collection included the 90-carat Briolette of India diamond. In 1967, after her death, the American jeweler Harry Winston purchased her collection of diamonds and pearls for $4million. Dorothy Killam was a lifelong baseball fan. In St. Louis she had supported the St. Louis Browns and after her marriage, she became a fan of the International League's Montreal Royals, the top farm team of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In the 1940s the Killams started spending more time in New York due to Killam's business interests, and Dorothy Killam became a supporter of the Dodgers, attending home games at Ebbets Field. She was so enthusiastic about the team that she offered to buy it from its owner Walter O'Malley for $5million, but he did not accept the offer. Killam considered his wife to have \\"the best business brain of any woman he ever met\\", and discussed his business affairs with her throughout their married life. In 1954 Killam, in failing health, retired as president of Royal Securities and sold the company to his senior staff. He died at his fishing camp on the Cascapédia River on 5 August 1955. He did not leave a will and his wife inherited his entire estate of $83million. Approximately half of this amount went to the Canadian government as estate tax. The government realized a similar sum from the estate of Sir James Dunn, who died less than six months later. The combined tax windfall of $85million, with an additional $15million from the government, was used to launch the Canada Council for the Arts in 1957. Widowhood Dorothy Killam made tens of millions of dollars by selling the shares she had inherited in her late husband's companies. She continued to increase her fortune, investing heavily in short term bonds. She once bought up a whole issue of Nova Scotia government bonds. In August 1960 the Ladies' Home Journal featured her in an article about \\"The Richest Women in the World\\". She lived on the income from her estate, considering the capital to be held \\"in trust\\", to be passed on \\"for the benefit of the country\\". She and her husband had discussed who should benefit from their wealth. He wanted it to go to Canadian, and especially Nova Scotian, institutions, and universities. He was, however, against \\"putting money he had made into buildings, into capital expenditures\\". She was careful to respect his wishes both in the donations she made during her lifetime and in her will. In the early 1960s, she gave two Canadian institutions anonymous donations of $4,250,000 each. One was to the Canada Council, stipulating that the interest should be used to finance \\"advanced study or research in medicine, science and engineering by Canadians in Canada\\", while the other was to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Dalhousie University, which awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1962, had already received nearly $400,000. In June 1959 she was revealed to be one of the three principal backers of the New York franchise in the proposed Continental League, which was to be a third baseball major league. In 1960 she dropped out of the consortium, reportedly for tax reasons related to her Canadian citizenship. In April 1960 Dorothy Killam became a member of the board of the Metropolitan Opera Association. She was also a benefactress of the company, financing its new productions of La sonnambula in 1963 and Lucia di Lammermoor in 1964. After her husband's death, she kept the house in Montreal, the two houses in Nassau, and the New York apartment. In 1963, after several summers visiting friends on the French Riviera, she purchased the Villa Leopolda in Villefranche-sur-Mer from Gianni and Marella Agnelli. Despite her husband's reluctance to fund capital projects, Dorothy Killam wanted to build a memorial in his name. In 1964 she was solicited for a major contribution to the building of a new children's hospital in Halifax. She first pledged $75,000, but soon offered $3million, later raising that to $5million. She decided to leave Montreal and bought an apartment in Halifax, which she intended to make her Canadian home. She visited Halifax in May 1965, consulting with the architects and the hospital's board of directors. She also met with the president of Dalhousie University, which she intended to benefit from her estate. Legacy Dorothy Killam died at Villa Leopolda on 27 July 1965, leaving an estate worth $93million. Aside from some personal bequests, which were subject to estate taxes, her fortune was left to institutions and was not subject to tax. She left $8million toward the construction of the children's hospital in Halifax, which opened in 1970 as the Izaak Walton Killam Hospital for Children. Her will provided for the establishment of the Killam Trusts, whose stated purpose was > to help in the building of Canada's future by encouraging advanced study... > to increase the scientific and scholastic attainments of Canadians, to > develop and expand the work of Canadian universities, and to promote > understanding between Canadians and peoples of other countries. Dalhousie University received $30million, while the University of British Columbia and the University of Alberta were given $14million and $16million respectively. The Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital at McGill University received $4million. She left a further $12million to the Canada Council \\"to establish a fund to provide income for a new program of assistance to advanced research\\". As of 2015, more than 6000 scholars and researchers had benefited from Killam Trust awards.

The name literally refers to lands beyond the purview of the Zhifang Si, the Imperial cartography office. It was the first detailed atlas of global geography available in Chinese. Authorship In the late 16th century, Western cartography was introduced to China by Matteo Ricci, who produced the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu, China's first world map, in 1602. The Wanli Emperor, who commissioned Ricci's map, subsequently ordered Ricci's colleagues Diego de Pantoja and Sabatino de Ursis to produce a book explaining the geography of the new countries shown; their work was eventually edited, compiled and revised by Giulio Aleni. In 1623, the book was finally published by Yang Tingyun in Hangzhou, and three years later was later reissued in a revised edition in Fujian. Content The eight scrolls of the Zhifang Waiji divide the world into five continents, each with separate maps and descriptions. These are named as Asia, Europe, Libya (Africa), Americas, and Magellanica (Europe receives considerably more coverage than any other continent). An additional section covers the oceans. Ricci's original map had placed China off to one side, which resulted in a somewhat negative reception in Chinese scholarly circles; when Aleni and Yang published their version, they adjusted the design so that China occupied the centre of the world map. This small change made the Zhifang Waiji more popular, and it had a much longer and more wide-ranging influence than the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu as a result. Cultural impact The Zhifang Waiji was introduced to Korea by Jeong Duwon in 1631, a gift from the Jesuit translator João Rodrigues... The book was introduced to Japan during the Edo period, but was initially banned because of its Christian authorship and its initial appearance in a collection of Christian writings. The ban was lessened in 1720 to allow works which did not directly relate to Christianity to be bought and sold, and the first \\"legitimate\\" sale of the book to Japan came in 1731. Despite the fact that only one edition was printed, it appears to have been widely read. Much of the text was reused by Ferdinand Verbiest in 1674 for his Kunyu Tushuo (Explanation of the World Map), and it was reprinted in a number of collections, including Li Zhizao's Collection of Celestial Studies, the Siku Quanshu and a number of 19th and early 20th century encyclopedias.

After he finished his classical studies, he went to New York City where he discovered his passion for jazz.

This plan was never accomplished because he immediately received an offer from The Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts to teach the Jazz History course and direct small ensembles. His course program spread over four years, covering the roots of jazz, moving on to Swing, Be Bop, and Hard Bop. While he was teaching at Thelma Yellin, Golan also taught at other schools.

Floyd served in the Oklahoma Senate from 1984 to 1988, representing district 13. After her time in office, Floyd has remained active in historical preservation and several other community service projects. After her term, she served both as P.T. Supervisor for first year teachers at her alma mater, East Central University and P.T. Field Representative for the US Census Bureau. Early life Billie Jean Floyd was born on Christmas Eve in 1929 at the very beginning of the Great Depression. Raised in Ada, OK, Floyd's family did not experience the Depression as many others did, in that her father was employed with Railway Express Agency. Floyd graduated from Ada High School in 1947. Her parents were very encouraging of her education, so after graduation from high school, Floyd attended East Central University. Education and Career Floyd graduated with her bachelor's degree in education in 1951. Immediately after, she pursued graduate school at the Texas Women's University. She stayed there for a short time and then returned to her home state where she taught her first year in Duncan, Oklahoma. After that first year, Floyd signed a contract with East Central University and began to teach at the college. In 1952, Floyd married her high school sweetheart, Ben Floyd. She earned her Master's in Education from OU in 1955. Her two daughters were born in 1958 and 1961. After a long career in education, Floyd decided to run for the state senate in district 13. Oklahoma Senate (1984-1988) Floyd was actively involved with politics before she decided to run for office. During her childhood, religion and politics were daily discussions at the dinner table and her family members openly supported political campaigns. Floyd teamed up with Lou and Wes Watkins to petition for the Equal Rights Amendment before she decided to campaign for office. They were told that if they received enough signatures, senator Roy Boatner would change his vote from a \\"no\\" to a \\"yes.\\" Floyd and her companions did not succeed in completing the petition. Soon after, Floyd ran for office and was elected in 1984. She learned that their earlier petition would have not changed senator Boatner's vote, and this recognition majorly influenced some of her political decisions later on in her life. While campaigning, Floyd would hand peppermints to the public saying, \\"“Hello, my name is Billie Floyd and I’m running for the State Senate, and I just want to tell you that your vote would mean a mint to me, and here it is to show you.\\" Committees *Tourism Committee Chairman *Education *Agriculture *Transportation *Appropriations *Rules Floyd's old botany professor from East Central, Dr. Doyle McCoy, approached her in order to establish a state flower.

Retirement Since leaving office, Floyd has served her community in several other capacities. She worked as a first-year residency teacher supervisor for East Central University. She also conducted interviews for the U.S. Census Bureau. Aside from these two positions, Floyd busies herself with many community service projects and organizations.

When the horns of the hunt are heard, she panics and eventually collapses exhausted, begging each of her acquaintances to help her escape. All give her different excuses, the last being a \\"trotting calf\\" who bids her \\"Adieu\\" as the hunters burst onto the scene. The poem won widespread popularity for some 150 years afterwards but, on a prose version appearing in a collection of Aesop's Fables, Gay's original authorship has gradually become forgotten. The fable's history The story appeared as the final poem in the book of fables written by John Gay at the royal suggestion for the instruction of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. Soon after its publication in 1727, Gay's hopes of Court preferment were disappointed and the story was put about by his friends that the fable had a personal application. In particular, Jonathan Swift wrote how \\"Gay, the Hare with many friends, /Twice seven long years at court attends,” only to be let down.John Heaneage Jesse, Memoirs of the Court of England, London 1843, Vol.3, pp.87-90 Though the fable's correct title is \\"The Hare and many friends\\", this mythologising of the poet's misfortunes contributed to its often being misquoted as \\"The Hare with many friends\\". The mistake was perpetuated by the frequently reprinted biographical notice, originally written by David Erskine Baker for his The Companion to the Play- house (1764), in which it is so mentioned.Vol.2, unpaginated The Fables as a whole went through repeated editions and were \\"translated into every European language\\",Frasers Magazine 17, 1838 p.196 besides a Latin version by Christopher Anstey.Fabulæ selectæ auctore Johanne Gay latine redditæ, 1777 \\"The Hare and many friends\\" stood out as a particular favourite and was frequently anthologised in addition. It also became a recitation piece. William Cowper was \\"reckoned famous\\" for his childhood performances in the 1730s, not long after the Fables first appeared.Charles Ryskamp, William Cowper of the Inner Temple, Cambridge University 1959, p.56 At the other end of the century, it is mentioned as an accomplishment of Catherine Morland, the heroine of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, who learned it \\"as quickly as any girl in England\\".Jane Austen’s Complete Novels, p.603 The fable's opening lines begin, in the manner of La Fontaine, with a proposition that is to be demonstrated by the story that follows, . ::Friendship, like love, is but a name, ::Unless to one you stint the flame. The gentle irony intended here was lost on some later readers at the start of the 19th century. One objected in print that \\"this singular position cannot be reconciled with our experience of the two different qualities of these passions\\".Paul Ponder, Noctes atticæ, or Reveries in a garret (London 1825), p.153 Another, a vicar's wife, was stirred to reply only in her commonplace book that “The British fabulist misleads the mind, /Friendship and love are better thus defined,” although her explanatory verses never saw publication.Open University reading experience database Though both objectors mention Gay's name as the author, confusion was soon to be sown by the inclusion of Gay's poem in collections of Aesop's fables. It is quoted in Samuel Howitt's illustrated A new work of animals, principally designed from the fables of Aesop, Gay and Phaedrus (1811), but no indication is given who was responsible for which fable appearing there.p.92 Again, the poem is quoted with no acknowledgement of Gay's authorship in the 1875 collection of Aesop's fables illustrated by Ernest Griset.Online archive A few years later Joseph Jacobs retold the story in prose under the title \\"The Hare with many friends\\" in his Aesop compilation of 1894. There it is given the moral \\"He that has many friends has no friends\\", based on Gay's opening: \\"'Tis thus in friendships; who depend/ On many, rarely find a friend\\". Jacobs also sentimentalises the ending, allowing the hare to escape from the hunters.pp.176-7 Although a note buried at the end of the book acknowledges that the fable was originally Gay's, the many reprintings of the prose version since have been unanimous in declaring Aesop as the fable's originator. Gallery of illustrations There have been several distinguished illustrators of the fable. They include Thomas Bewick. and possibly his brother John, as well as Bewick's pupil William Harvey. In addition, Samuel Howitt, who was acknowledged as the principal animal illustrator of his day, produced copperplates both for individual sale and as part of his A New Work of Animals. Ernest Griset's satirical prints restore a level of political caricature to the works he illustrates. Griset's apart, the majority of the prints show the exhausted hare lying at the foot of one or other of its apologetic friends; where it is the calf, there is a scene of hunters riding across the background.

Zamil Group, which now employs more than 12,000 people in 60 countries, is involved in diverse sectors including general construction, paints, plastics, petrochemicals, shipbuilding, and port management. He was awarded the King Abdul Aziz Medal, 1984 and the Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award for supporting industries in 2015. Early life and education Abdul Aziz Bin Abdullah Al Zamil was born in 1942 in Bahrain. He was the fourth of twelve sons of Abdullah Al-Hamad Al Zamil, originally from Onaiza, Central Arabia. Abdullah Al-Hamad Al Zamil established a food and textile trading entity in Bahrain in the 1930s, later expanding into real estate investment. Upon his death in 1961, the family chose to continue operation of his business as a group, under the leadership of the eldest son, Mohammed. Abdul Aziz Al Zamil attended primary school in Bahrain, where he also began his secondary school education. However, he completed his final year of high school in 1959 in Kuwait, together with his brother Abdulrahman Abdullah Al Zamil. After briefly studying business at Cairo University in Egypt, Al-Zamil decided to pursue studies in Great Britain. He attended a technical college in Salisbury and then enrolled in Concord College, where he studied math, biology, zoology, physics, and chemistry, and where he also strengthened his English language skills.Thackray, Arnold & Ulrych, Richard (2017) Building a Petrochemical Industry in Saudi Arabia, Obeikan Publishing In 1963 he received a scholarship from the government of Saudi Arabia to study at the University of Southern California (USC) in the United States. Because of the strong English language skills he had developed in Great Britain, he was able to complete his bachelor's and master's degrees within five years, receiving his bachelor's in industrial engineering in 1967, and his master's in 1968 from the University of Southern California. Career Returning to Saudi Arabia in 1968, Abdul Aziz Bin Abdullah Al Zamil worked for some years at the Saudi Consulting House, a joint venture of the Ministry of Trade and Industry of the Saudi government and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Under a United Nations fellowship, he traveled internationally to study industrial development in countries such as India, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Upon his return he was promoted to Deputy Director General. In 1975 he was asked by Ghazi Abdul Rahman Al Gosaibi, then Minister of Industry and Electricity, to take charge of an effort to form a state-owned joint-stock company that would serve as a catalyst for the industrialization of Saudi Arabia.Algosaibi, Ghazi A., Yes, (Saudi) Minister: a life in administration (1999) The London Centre of Arab Studies That company, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), was formally established by royal decree in 1976. Together with a group of young university-trained Saudis whom he recruited, Al-Zamil reviewed a large number of joint-venture proposals and identified those that were most promising. He then helped negotiated a series of joint- venture agreements with leading foreign chemical companies. Central to each of these agreements were provisions for the training of Saudi SABIC employees by the joint-venture partner. By this means there was an enormous transfer of business, technical, and marketing know-how to Saudi Arabia.Thackray, Arnold & Ulrych, Richard Building a Petrochemical Industry in Saudi Arabia (2017) Obeikan Publishing He served as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of SABIC from 1976–1983. In 1983 he was appointed Minister of Industry and Electricity for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and became Chairman of SABIC. He remained in these positions until 1995. During his tenure SABIC’s first generation and second generation of manufacturing operations came on line and then expanded, producing such products as polyethylene, propylene, ethylene glycol, ethylene dichloride, methyl tertiary butyl ether, vinyl chloride monomer, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, ammonia, and urea.AlSadoun, Abdulwahab, Molecules, Mind, and Matter (2015) Medina Publishing At the same time, Al-Zamil also encouraged the development of Saudi Arabia’s private industrial sector and worked to expand and improve access to electricity throughout Saudi Arabia.Thacray, Arnold & Ulrych, Richard (2017) Building a Petrochemical Industry in Saudi Arabia, Obeikan Publishing During this time he traveled extensively, supporting the training and recruiting of young Saudis in technical and professional fields, as well as promoting economic and industrial development. In 1984, he received the King Abdul Aziz Medal from King Fahd. Retiring from his government position in August 1995, Al Zamil jointed the family business, Zamil Group Holding Company, and supported its expansion into the newly accessible area of petrochemicals. He established the Saudi International Petrochemical Company (Sipchem) with his brother Abdulrahman, and became Chairman. In 2004, the Zamil Group helped to establish Sahara Petrochemicals Company. Again, Al Zamil became Chairman. He served as Director; Chairman of the board; and President, Chief Operating Officer and Director of the Zamil Group Holding Company. Eng. Abdulaziz Bin Abdullah Al Zamil was also the chairman of the board of directors of the Alinma Bank, as well as other institutions. He was awarded the Richard J.

It originally supplied early colonial mills with water power. It was fed by Stephenson Brook, which rises just north of Paine Lake and drains the large watershed adjacent to North Avenue from beyond Quaker Ridge Road. The lake appears to have existed as a natural sheet of water, near the end of the brook. It had two outlets into Long Island Sound, one at the present Stephenson Boulevard, and the other at the east side of Lispenard Avenue. These outlets had an abrupt fall in the few yards between the lake's south edge and the Long Island Sound shore, of approximately . This was the greatest natural fall of any stream emptying into the Sound between New York City and Connecticut. From very early, the value of it for water power was recognized. Mills and industry According to the 1689 deed from John Pell to Jacob Leisler, representing the Huguenot purchasers of New Rochelle, the area originally came under the ownership of John Jefferd. Jefferd was first to use the water power of this stream, operating a saw-mill and corn-mill until he died in the early eighteenth century. The land later came under the ownership of Jacob Leisler, who made improvements to the lake, including constructing a pool to supply an overshot wheel at the mill,Historical Landmarks of New Rochelle, Morgan Seacord 1938 pg.6 which needed Leisler to alter the route of the Boston Post Road, an action which he was later indicted for in 1711. This pool was south of and beside the lake, and required several new mill-dams and shifting the road to a new route over the lower dam. This raised the level of the lake and flooded a larger area than the natural lake. In 1734 the property came under the ownership of Anthony Lispenard, who erected an additional saw- mill between the lake and the pool, using the water flowing from the lake into the pool before it was drawn from the pool to the old grist-mill below. By 1750, this saw-mill was changed to a grist-mill as well. By the terms of Lispenard's will, the lake, pool and two mills became the property of his daughter Abigail, wife of Jacobus Bleecker. Before the Revolutionary War, their ownership passed to Andrew Abramse, whose wife was another daughter of Anthony Lispenard, In 1795. the lake and old mill were bought by John Searing and Samuel Wood, both Quakers. No trace has been found after the Revolutionary War of the second mill erected by Lispenard, and all knowledge of its former existence was lost. In the same year 1795, the owner of the lands adjoining the lake on the north gave permission for to raise the dam and flood more land. By 1806 the former milling industry shifted away from the area; however the lake continued to be used to impound water to operate a tannery, distillery and button factory before the factory burned while being fitted up as an ink factory for Thaddeus Davids in 1846. \\"Crystal Lake Ice\\" An ice industry was soon set up collecting ice when the lake froze. 1849, Thomas Andrews bought the lake and mill property to further develop the ice business. Large ice houses were erected south of the Boston Road in the present City Yard, and a runway was constructed across the road for the ice. This ice industry eventually developed into one of the most important in the region. The ice was all taken for the New York City and Brooklyn markets by the Brooklyn Ice Company, being transported by boats which landed at a dock adjoining the ice-houses. Recognized for the purity of its waters, the lake became known as \\"Crystal Lake\\", with its ice marketed as \\"Crystal Lake Ice.\\"Davis, Barbara (2009). Images of America - New Rochelle, NY. Chicago, IL: Arcadia Books. Health concerns By now, the very large amount of malarial fevers in the town had become a matter of public concern, and it was continually charged that the origin of the disease was traceable to the stagnant condition of this lake. Whether this was true is questionable, since the town had large areas of undrained swamp lands throughout that were the same or more threat to public health. However, as by now industrial use of the water of the lake had ceased, the water stood undisturbed by drainage for longer than ever before. The agitation increased so much that a move was made in 1864 to have the Town Board of Health condemn the lake as a public nuisance. Failing in this, the matter was brought before the State Board of Health. The Board, however, refused to act, having found that the lake had large quantities of fish of various kinds as in other fresh water lakes of the state. Additionally, the ice shipped to New York and Brooklyn was found to be of sufficient purity to meet the health test of those cities. Failing in both of these efforts to compel the abatement of the lake as a public nuisance, John Stephenson, who had been the leader in the movement to rid the neighborhood of the alleged menace to health, and whose estate \\"Clifford\\" was near by, bought the lake and adjacent property himself. The dams were then demolished, and the water of the lake and pool let out into Echo Bay. The bed of the lake was reclaimed as dry land and the brook was confined between stone walls constructed to control its flow from the railroad embankment to the Boston Post Road. Streets were then laid out over the lake bottom and the surrounding property was developed as residential parks. In 1913 Stephenson School was built on a high point of land which had been an island in the middle of the lake, \\"Vineyard Island\\", known for its wild grapes. Main Street was straightened so that it now runs over the mill's old supply. The brook was enclosed in a culvert and now runs under and along the side of Stephenson Boulevard, and under Main Street into the bay.

In the synergistic response, the applied antibiotics work together to produce an effect more potent than if each antibiotic were applied singly. Compare to the additive effect, where the potency of an antibiotic combination is roughly equal to the combined potencies of each antibiotic singly, and antagonistic effect, where the potency of the combination is less than the combined potencies of each antibiotic.  Clinical interest  Clinical interest in synergism dates back to the early 1950s when practitioners noted that patients with enterococcal endocarditis experienced a high relapse rate when penicillin G alone was used for treatment and a demonstrably lower relapse rate when streptomycin was combined with penicillin G to combat the infection. Since that time the research community has conducted numerous studies regarding the effects and possibilities of antibiotic combinations. Today, combination therapy is recognized as providing a broad spectrum of antibiotic coverage, effectively fighting polymicrobial infections, minimizing selection for antibiotic resistant strains, lowering dose toxicity where applicable, and in some cases providing synergistic activity.  Desirability  Antibiotic synergy is desirable in a clinic sense for several reasons. At the patient level, the boosted antimicrobial potency provided by synergy allows the body to more rapidly clear infections, resulting in shorter courses of antibiotic therapy. Shorter courses of therapy in turn reduce the effects of dose-related toxicity, if applicable. Additionally, synergy aids in total bacterial eradication, more completely removing an infection than would be possible without synergy. At a higher level, synergistic effects are useful for combating resistant bacterial strains through increased potency and for stalling the spread of bacterial resistance through the total eradication of infections, preventing the evolutionary selection of resistant cells and strains.  Current research directions  Current research on antibiotic synergy and potential therapies is moving in three primary directions. Some research is devoted to finding combinations of extant antibiotics which when combined exhibit synergy. A classic example of this effect is the interaction between β-lactams, which damage the bacteria cell membrane, and aminoglycosides, which inhibit protein synthesis. The damage dealt to the cell wall by β-lactams allows more aminoglycoside molecules to be taken up into the cell than would otherwise be possible, enhancing cell damage. In some cases, antibacterial combinations restore potency to ineffective drugs. Other research has been devoted to finding antibiotic resistance breakers (ARB's) which enhance an antibiotic's potency. This effect is mediated through direct antibacterial activity of the ARB, targeting and destroying mechanisms of bacterial resistance thereby allowing the antibiotic to function properly, interacting with the host to trigger defensive mechanisms, or some combination thereof. The third direction of research involves combining traditional antibiotics with unconventional bactericides such as silver nano particles. Silver nano particles have strong non-specific interactions with bacterial cells that result in cell wall deformation and the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of cellular components. These effects are thought to weaken bacterial cells, making them more susceptible to assault from conventional antibiotics.

Designed by British American architect and Freemason Richard Sharp Smith, the building was opened in April 1915. It is listed in the United States National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building in the Downtown Asheville Historic District. It is a four-story pressed brick building with limestone and grey brick trim, upon a granite foundation. It has a red tile hipped roof above its front portion. The Broadway facade has a two- story portico with paired Ionic columns. History Architect Smith was originally from England and was working in New York City for Richard Morris Hunt who hired him to supervise the construction of the Biltmore House. On July 1, 1909, Mount Hermon Lodge No. 118 and the Royal Arch Masons Asheville Chapter, jointly purchased the lot at 80 Broadway in Asheville on which the Asheville Masonic Temple currently stands. In April 1912 a meeting was held between Mount Hermon Lodge #118 and the Scottish Rite Valley of Asheville's Lodge of Perfection to devise a plan for the building of a new Masonic Temple. The plan was to organize a building company composed of members of both bodies. It was suggested that the basement and first floor would include a reading room, library, secretaries’ offices, lobby, banquet hall, and a kitchen. The second floor would be used by Mount Hermon Lodge and other appendant bodies, such as the Order of the Eastern Star and the York Rite. The third and fourth floors were to be used by the Valley Of Asheville Scottish Rite. In May 1913 a contract was signed with McPherson Construction Company to construct the building for a price of $56,260. Almost two years later, on April 29, 1915, the Masonic Temple Company accepted the building from the contractor. The original plans, deeds and survey plats are still among the Temple's records.  Notable members  There have been several prominent Masons whose Masonic careers originated from the Asheville Masonic Temple. * Robert Brank Vance was Master of Mount Hermon Lodge #118 in 1866, 1867 and 1873, and Grand Master of Masons of North Carolina in 1868 and 1869.

It is approximately long and flows through Scranton. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek loses substantial amounts of water to underground mine pools. The creek is in the Coal Region and has been channelized and/or culvertized in some reaches. It flows alongside Pennsylvania Route 307 for a substantial part of its length. The creek has a riparian buffer in its upper and middle reaches, but various invasive plants grow along its banks in its lower reaches. Course Leach Creek begins in a pond in a deep valley near Morgan Manor in Scranton. It flows southeast alongside Pennsylvania Route 307 before turning south and continuing to flow alongside that highway. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns southeast again and receives South Branch Leach Creek, its only named tributary, from the right. It then turns south-southeast for several tenths of a mile and crosses Pennsylvania Route 307 before turning east and crossing US Route 11. After several tenths of a mile, the creek reaches its confluence with Leggetts Creek. Leach Creek joins Leggetts Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Leach Creek experiences a measurable amount of flow loss to underground mine pools via cracks in the bedrock. This water contributes to the Marvine Pool and the Stoors Pool. It typically, but not always, lacks any base flow. Several establishments discharge stormwater into the creek. There are an estimated two stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek experiences extreme sedimentation and embeddedness in its lower reaches. The city of Scranton applied for a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek. In the early 1900s, Leach Creek was found to be a clear stream above the Cayuga Shaft, where mine water flowed into the creek. From that point downstream, culm in the water deposited on the banks and streambed. In 1948, the creek was found to lose between 968 and 1319 gallons of water per minute to mines. At its mouth, the peak annual discharge of Leach Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching 430 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 1000 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 1360 cubic feet per second. It has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 2760 cubic feet per second. Like many other streams in the area, the creek is prone to flash floods. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Leach Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. Leach Creek is in the Anthracite Region. It flows through coal measures and is a typical example of such a stream. The surficial geology along the lower reaches of the creek mainly consists of urban land, Wisconsinan Till, and surface mining land. The upper reaches of the creek are near urban land, Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of coal, conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. A small wetland pond forms the headwaters of Leach Creek. In its lower reaches, the creek is culvertized by a stone arch culvert in one reach and flows through a tall, narrow stone channel under a culm pile in one reach. Garbage has been dumped along the stream in its lower reaches. In its lower reaches, it has been ripraped and flows through a flood control debris basin. The debris basin was constructed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and prevents flooding on Bloom Street. Leach Creek flows over cobbles in some reaches. The creek flows through 49 pipes, with sizes ranging from . Watershed The watershed of Leach Creek has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. The creek is a second-order stream. Most of the watershed is in Scranton. However, substantial areas of it are in South Abington Township, Ransom Township, and Newton Township. Leach Creek is highly urbanized and may be channelized in some locations. Neighborhoods in the creek's vicinity include Morgan Manor, Allied Services, and Keyser Oak Plaza. Land uses in the watershed include low-density residential, industrial, and commercial. A patch of wetland occurs in the southwestern part of the watershed and a smaller patch is located near the center of the watershed. For a substantial of its length, Leach Creek is in the vicinity of Pennsylvania Route 307. A cemetery, a medical services complex, and a condominium are also in the creek's vicinity. However, there is little development directly along the creek's banks in its upper and middle reaches. In the creek's lower reaches, it is heavily impacted by urban development. It flows past the Keyser-Oak Shopping Mall in this reach. Major roads in the watershed of Leach Creek include Pennsylvania Route 307, Market Street, Morgan Manor Drive, Moffat Drive, Yard Avenue, Keyser Avenue, Bloom Avenue, McDonough Avenue, and the North Scranton Expressway. History Leach Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199013. Leach Creek was redirected under Keyser Avenue in 1909. A concrete culvert bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 307 over Leach Creek was built in 1969 in Scranton. This bridge is long. Historic places in the watershed of Leach Creek include the Cayuga Vault. A $100,000 Leach Creek Basin Maintenance Project has been proposed. Biology Leach Creek has a stable riparian buffer in its upper and middle reaches. However, in its lower reaches the riparian area is almost nonexistent and is overgrown with invasive plants. In this reach, the understory is dominated by Japanese knotweed and the canopy is dominated by Ailanthus and Norway maple. The riparian buffer mainly consists of one line of trees. The aquatic habitat of the creek would require significant restoration efforts to be repaired. The entire length of Leach Creek is a Trout Stocked Fishery.
